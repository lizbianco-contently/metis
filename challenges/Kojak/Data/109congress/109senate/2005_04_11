Mr. President, the Senate will begin this afternoon with a \nperiod for morning business to allow Senators to make statements and \nintroduce legislation. At 3 p.m. today, Chairman Cochran will be here \nto begin consideration of the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act \nfor defense, the global war on terror, and tsunami relief. I expect \nopening statements on that bill during the afternoon. I also hope if \nSenators have amendments, they will begin to offer those amendments \nduring today's session. At the very least, Senators should notify the \ncloakrooms of their desire to offer specific amendments so that the \nchairman and ranking member may begin the process of scheduling their \nconsiderations.\n  I remind all Senators we have a vote scheduled this afternoon at 5:30 \non the confirmation of a U.S. district judge. That is the nomination of \nPaul Crotty to the Southern District of New York. In addition to that \nvote, we have a resolution relating to airbus that we will likely \nschedule for a rollcall vote. Therefore, Senators can expect at least \ntwo votes today. I add that if amendments are offered to the \nappropriations bill today, I will also be talking to the managers of \nthe bill and the Democratic leader about scheduling votes on those as \nwell.\n  This important bill provides necessary funds for the ongoing \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as additional funding for \nhumanitarian assistance related to the tsunami. I hope the Senate will \nact effectively and efficiently on this appropriations bill and use the \nunderlying legislation as focus of the intent of this bill and not as \ntarget practice for other amendments. There has been a lot of \ndiscussion over the issue of immigration. I believe the Senate will \nneed to address immigration reform. However, this is not the place for \ncomprehensive immigration reform. We need to be thoughtful and\n\n[[Page S3366]]\n\ndeliberate on that issue and not allow funding for our troops to become \nensnarled in that national debate. The Democratic leader and I have \nbegun discussions on the aspect of how we might address immigration. I \ndo urge our colleagues to show restraint on this issue and on other \nissues that will clearly slow down this emergency spending bill.\n  Having said that, we will have a very busy week on the bill. We can \nexpect full sessions and well into some evenings as we consider this \nlegislation. I do thank my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/11/senate-section/article/S3366-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

People were able to watch on \nnational TV what took place. Parts of the building were evacuated.\n  The reason I mention this, without going into a lot of detail, is \nbecause of the great police force we have that takes care of the U.S. \nCapitol. They did work that was brilliant. I spoke to the Sergeant of \nArms before we went into session. What they did to get ready to take \nthat man down was extraordinary.\n  We have the finest trained police force anyplace in the country. I \nwould put our men and women up against anyone else. They do such a \nwonderful job. I express my appreciation for the whole Senate for the \nwork of the Sergeant at Arms and Chief Gainer. This is professionalism \nat its best.\n  What we do not see, of course, are the many times when they work off \ncamera, when they do it late at night in various parts of this building \nwhere there are not a lot of people watching them.\n  Mr. President, again, I applaud and congratulate every member of our \nCapitol Police force.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/11/senate-section/article/S3366-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--S.

Mr. President, in my home State of West Virginia and all \nacross America, our people are frustrated and outraged with the soaring \ncost of gasoline.\n  The rising cost of gasoline means workers in West Virginia are seeing \ntheir paychecks dramatically reduced by the simple fact that they have \nto drive to get to work and to get back home. It is darned difficult \nand expensive for a coal miner to pay $2.25 a gallon to drive his \npickup truck to work on the two-lane, hilly, winding roads of West \nVirginia.\n  Noting that West Virginians have become ``hawkish about watching gas \nprices,'' the Charleston, WV, Gazette of March 11, 2005, pointed out \nthat they ``have few mass transportation options, travel farther to \nwork, and often traverse [much] more rugged terrain.''\n  Automobiles are essential for West Virginians to get to work. \nAccording to Census data, although West Virginia is a relatively small \nState, workers in West Virginia spend more time commuting to work than \nthe national average.\n  Mr. President, 86 percent of West Virginians use cars or trucks to \nget to work, and nearly 75 percent of West Virginians commute by \nthemselves in their pickup trucks and other such vehicles.\n  The percentage of people in West Virginia who own a pickup truck is \nalmost double the national average. Nearly one-third of West Virginians \nmust travel outside their home county to get to work. Let me say that \nagain. Nearly one-third of West Virginians must travel outside their \nhome county to get to work, a figure that is 17 percent above the \nnational average, and an average West Virginian drives more miles--now \nget this--the average West Virginian drives more miles each year than \naverage Americans throughout the rest of the country.\n  The point is this: West Virginians rely on their cars and their \npickup trucks to keep West Virginia working. Large, rugged vehicles are \nnot an expensive luxury for workers in West Virginia and in many other \nrural States, and anyone who has tried to navigate the narrow, uphill \nclimbs of West Virginia's mountains by weaving around corners, \nconstantly slowing, constantly accelerating and stopping and starting \nknows the need for these rugged vehicles and, regrettably, the cost of \nfueling them.\n  Imagine navigating that kind of terrain not only to work but also in \ngetting children to school, as well as to the grocery store.\n  The frustration and the outrage of West Virginians paying $25, $30, \nand $45 just to gas up is certainly understandable.\n  Family budgets already strained by the rising costs of health \ninsurance, the rising costs of college tuition, and other everyday \nexpenses are being stretched even thinner by these recordbreaking \ngasoline prices in West Virginia. West Virginia's small businesses \ndepend on deliveries. Floral shops, pizza parlors, produce shippers, \ntaxi companies, construction and remodeling businesses, plumbers, \nelectricians, landscapers are finding it harder to make ends meet. Many \nare going out of business.\n  I recently read of an independent trucker who lives and works in \nNorfolk, VA, telling the Christian Science Monitor that last year she \npaid more than $250 a week for fuel, and that was making her life as a \nsingle parent very difficult. She was even forced to decide between \npaying a doctor bill for her child or buying new tires for her truck. \nGuess who lost. ``My truck lost,'' she explained.\n  Today's record high gasoline prices in West Virginia are affecting \nliterally everyone from commuters, consumers, and businesses to public \nand private agencies. Meals on Wheels programs are having trouble \ndelivering meals. Think of it. Local governments already straining to \npay for essential services in these days of cutbacks in Federal \nassistance are simply overwhelmed in their efforts to keep schoolbuses, \npolice cars, firetrucks, and other city and county vehicles in \noperation. What a shame.\n\n[[Page S3367]]\n\n  The damage is devastating and is everywhere. Last year, polling data \nshowed that more than half of the American people said the rising cost \nof gasoline had been hard on them financially while more than a third \nsaid it had caused them serious problems. U.S. consumer confidence fell \nfor a third month in March, and this is being attributed to the cost of \ngasoline. It is awful. It is terrible.\n  At one time, inflation was called the cruelest tax. Soaring energy \ncosts are the ecumenical tax. Did everyone get that? Soaring energy \ncosts are the ecumenical tax. Why? They tax everyone with a car or a \ntruck--everyone, regardless of race, sex, age, occupation. Low-income \nworkers are being hit the hardest, however, as they usually have to \ntravel the farthest to work because of the need for affordable housing. \nThey have less access to mass transportation. One can understand that \nwhen they look at those mountains in West Virginia. And they drive \nolder, less fuel-efficient vehicles.\n  As the American people cry out for help in this current crisis, what \ndo they do? They look to Washington for action. The White House's \nresponse to this outcry has been to moan and groan about the failure of \nCongress to pass its so-called energy plan and recycle old legislation.\n  When it comes to dealing with today's energy mess, the White House is \nout of gas. For three Congresses, an energy bill has clanged about \nWashington like Marley's ghost. The administration's national energy \npolicy has been drafted by special interests, ironed out behind closed \ndoors now and presented as a fait accompli for Members to support, take \nit or leave it. But the national energy policy in its totality would do \nlittle to seriously address our energy needs now or in the long term.\n  The only major provisions that might provide tangible progress are \nthe energy tax incentives, but these, too, could be a mirage as the \nPresident's proposed fiscal year 2006 budget only provides $6.7 billion \nover the next 10 years for all energy incentives, only about a third of \nwhat was provided 2 years ago in the Senate Energy bill. Analysis by \nthe Department of Energy's own Energy Information Administration, EIA, \nof the Energy bill of the 108th Congress has clearly shown that the \nbill would have a negligible impact on increasing production, reducing \nconsumption, lowering imports, or affecting energy prices. Now, take \nthat home for dinner.\n\n  Furthermore, this administration actually significantly slashes \nfunding for oil and gas research programs. Like its agricultural \npolicies, the administration's energy policy promises the American \npeople a rose garden. It ruminates with much rhetoric but then fails to \nfertilize with funding.\n  While the White House has failed to propose any serious policy \noptions or take any action to remedy the current crisis, I am \nsuggesting that it is time--it is time, I say to the White House--to \nget serious. It is time that this Nation makes the necessary \ninvestments so we can reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\n  What does this mean? It means getting the next generation of vehicles \non the road. It means investing in fuels that can be made from \ndomestically secure sources such as agricultural residues and through \ncoal gasification. It means investments in building. It means upgrading \nour refining and pipeline infrastructure in order to move our petroleum \nproducts to market.\n  At the end of the day, it requires that we set our sights on the goal \nof getting off foreign oil. Senator Bingaman sent a letter to the \nSecretary of Energy and the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency in April 2004. That letter laid out 13 concrete \nactions that President Bush could take to respond to high gasoline \nprices. I concurred with many of these recommendations in a letter to \nthe President myself in May 2004. However, this administration has not \nfollowed through on any of these suggestions.\n  Right now, more than ever, what we need are not only long-term \npolicies but also near-term programs and actions that address the \nimmediate problem. For one thing, as the great British economist John \nMaynard Keynes reminded us, ``In the long run we are all dead.''\n  I am also reminded of the response that an aide to President Franklin \nRoosevelt gave when asked why the administration was acting so quickly \nand forcefully at the time to put people back to work during the dark \ndays of the Great Depression--I lived in them--when in the long run \nmarket forces would eventually do it. The aide, Harry Hopkins, snapped: \nPeople do not eat in the long run. They eat every day.\n  While we do need long-term energy policies to reduce our dependency \non foreign energy, we still drive cars every day during the dark days \nof these soaring gasoline prices. American workers, American consumers, \nand American small businesses suffer because of the failure of their \nGovernment to provide short-term relief.\n  Here are some suggestions which might provide assistance. The White \nHouse could direct the Secretary of Energy to suspend the delivery of \noil to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve until market conditions improve. \nWe might consider liberalizing the vehicle depreciation allowance \nto assist workers who daily commute more than 30 miles one way to work, \nand $15.5 billion in targeted tax incentives over the next 10 years, \nincluding $2 billion to deploy advanced clean coal technologies, would \nhelp to strengthen the economy, enhance our Nation's energy resources, \npromote an array of advanced energy technologies and increase jobs \nwhile promoting a healthy government.\n\n  Yes, we can do more. We can do plenty. We need an investigation into \nwhat is going on and why the people in West Virginia and other States \nare getting squeezed, why the people in West Virginia and other States \nare getting gouged, when huge oil companies are enjoying recordbreaking \nprofits. I call on the White House to direct the Federal Trade \nCommission to review whether speculations in the futures market may be \nplaying a role in driving up gasoline prices. I call for a \ncongressional investigation to ascertain the role of oil companies in \nsetting the steep price that West Virginians and people in other rural \nStates pay at the pump.\n  Finally, I urge the White House to stop wimping out and to confront \nOPEC. Press these oil-producing countries to increase oil supply to \nhelp stabilize global prices. While running for the Presidency, George \nBush promised to get tough with OPEC, especially the Saudis. Now, Mr. \nPresident, is the time to do it.\n  The White House should work on rehabilitating its own weak, creaky \nspine which has kept it from playing hardball with the foreign \ncountries that sell us most of our oil. In his book, ``Plan of \nAttack,'' Bob Woodward reported that Saudi Arabia offered to fine-tune \noil prices in the months before the 2004 Presidential election. Why not \nuse the bully pulpit now to call for increased oil production? Why not \ndispatch the Secretary of State to OPEC countries to twist arms and \nknock heads together to get an increase in oil production? Why does the \nWhite House remain silent, as silent as a stone, when OPEC announces, \nas it did on March 30, that it had ruled out an increase in oil \nproduction? Why does the administration hold its tongue when Middle \nEastern potentates collude to separate working Americans from their \nhard-earned dollars?\n  Instead of reading headlines about tough administrative action to \nreduce oil prices, we read of scandals about lucrative billion-dollar, \nno-bid contracts for Iraqi oil fields. Instead of lowering prices at \nthe pump in the USA, less than 18 months ago the White House asked \nCongress to approve $900 million in taxpayer money to send more \ngasoline to filling stations. Where? Baghdad.\n  The President might not have a short-term energy strategy for the \nUnited States, but he has a great one for Iraq. The only problem is \nthat the American people are paying for it twice, once on April 15, the \nday our income taxes are due, and once again on every trip to the \nfilling station.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time. I yield the floor and I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Senate now has under consideration \nH.R. 1268, the fiscal year 2005 emergency supplemental appropriations \nbill. Pending is the substitute amendment recommended by the Committee \non Appropriations. The committee met last Wednesday, April 6, and \nreported the bill with the substitute amendment by a unanimous consent \nvote of 28 to 0.\n  Our recommended substitute would provide a total of $80,581,832,000 \nin supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 2005. The recommendation \nis $1,460,796,000 below the President's request and $758,046,000 below \nthe amount recommended in the House-passed bill.\n  The substitute is comprised of six titles.\n  Title I provides a total of $74,426,257,000 for defense-related \nactivities, primarily the costs of continuing operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  Title II includes $4,322,700,000 for international security programs, \nfor assistance for reconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan, and for \nsupport for coalition allies.\n  Title III provides appropriations in the amount of $687,145,000 for \ndomestic activities related to homeland security and counterterrorism.\n  Title IV includes appropriations for Indian Ocean tsunami relief in \nthe amount of $907,344,000.\n  Title V includes $238,390,000 for other emergency appropriations.\n  Title VI includes general provisions and technical corrections.\n  This is a straightforward bill. It meets the needs of our fighting \nforces overseas. It provides funding to meet our international \nresponsibilities. It offers relief to the victims of the catastrophic \ntsunami in the Indian Ocean and addresses emergency requirements at \nhome. It is critically important we move this bill through the Senate \nin a deliberate but expeditious fashion so we may confer with our \ncolleagues from the other body and present legislation for the \nPresident's signature by the end of this month.\n  I will not take further time of the Senate today to go into all of \nthe details of the proposal. Individual subcommittee chairmen and their \nranking minority members will be available to Senators to explain the \ndetails of the bill as needed and as requested by Senators.\n  At the appropriate time, I will move the committee substitute be \nadopted and be treated as original text for the purposes of further \namendment.\n  Before yielding to my distinguished friend and colleague from West \nVirginia, Senator Byrd, the ranking minority member of the committee, I \nshare with the Senate an interesting e-mail that was sent to one of my \nstaff members by one of the helicopter pilots who was aboard the USS \nAbraham Lincoln, which steamed into the Indian Ocean immediately upon \nhearing about the devastating earthquakes and the tsunami tidal waves \nin that region of the world. They were one of our largest ships in the \ngeneral region. They immediately got underway from their\n\n[[Page S3394]]\n\nport when they heard the news and could tell how serious this situation \nwas and steamed to the region.\n  This friend wrote an e-mail to my detailee from the Department of \nDefense who is a CDR Brian Glackin. At this time he has gone back to \nactive duty for his full-time job in the Navy. He gets this e-mail, \nwhich he gave me a copy of, which I will read portions of so we can \nappreciate the response of the United States, as quickly as it was \nmade, to this devastating situation.\n\n       Stationed aboard the Abraham Lincoln we were inport Hong \n     Kong on the morning of 26 Dec when we heard of the massive \n     earthquake and devastating Tsunamis in the Bay of Bengal. As \n     soon as we were aware of the horrible destruction we departed \n     Hong Kong and headed South at best speed . . .\n\n  Then he described what happened when they arrived.\n\n       I was in the first wave of helos sent ashore to establish a \n     logistical hub and move supplies from Banda Acch airport--\n     only a few miles from the destroyed north coast of the \n     island.\n\n  He describes the bodies in the water, the houses floating in the \nocean, the scenes along the coast as they were flying into the airport.\n\n       We arrived at the airport to a scene of confusion and near \n     chaos. Six days after the disaster and there was no \n     infrastructure in place to assist these people. About 500 \n     displaced Indonesians who had survived had made their way to \n     the airport in search of a flight out of the area.\n       . . . there was only one other American military member at \n     the airport--an Army Major who had made his way up from the \n     Embassy in Jakarta. A few Australians were already there and \n     had set up a logistics hub to accept supplies. The Indonesian \n     military had a base here as well and were accepting supplies \n     but they had no other way than trucks to travel to the \n     destroyed areas inland to move the food and water.\n\n  Then he talks about being a fixed wing pilot. He was not able to fly \nhelicopters, but he helped coordinate the relief efforts. He \ncomplimented the nongovernment organizations that within an hour had \nloaded our first relief supplies to move down the west coast. He \ncomplimented the USAID and the International Organization of Migration \nas being invaluable in the establishing of assistance. He said:\n\n       USAID has amazing logistical support to gather supplies \n     from all over the world. The one thing both of these \n     organizations lacked was the ability to distribute supplies \n     to the people in need. That is where we came into play.\n       We have set up a system now to have twelve of our \n     Helicopters flying from sunrise to sunset to assist. We have \n     been carrying everything from biscuits, rice, noodles, milk, \n     water and medical supplies. We transport doctors and medical \n     staff as well. The Indonesian people are in need of \n     everything. Their homes along the coast have been washed away \n     and we are finding them wandering aimlessly with no ability \n     to acquire food, water or badly needed medical assistance. \n     They all lack the ability to communicate as all phone lines \n     are destroyed and there is no electricity. As our pilots drop \n     off these supplies there are stories of the Indonesians \n     hugging them with relief and joy.\n       Our pilots then fly north to return back to [the airport] \n     for resupply and they are finding small pockets of personnel \n     who do not have any aid. They are able to pick many of them \n     up and fly them to [the airport]. Most are near death.\n       Yesterday we had a helo land with seven badly injured or \n     dehydrated personnel all in critical condition. One was a \n     seven year old girl. The doctors told me we saved her life as \n     she would not have lived through the night. I couldn't help \n     but think of my beautiful daughters and it was then that I \n     realized the gravity of what we really were doing.\n\n  He said:\n\n       I see on the news [now] the incredible outpouring of \n     support from the US--it is a wonderful and necessary thing. \n     The effort here at sea is equally as impressive. These young \n     sailors are all extremely eager to get ashore and do whatever \n     is needed despite the threat of disease and the obvious \n     destruction.\n\n  He pointed out earlier that no sailors were asked to do anything who \ndid not volunteer to do it. The commanding officer asked if sailors \nwould like to participate and go ashore, and there were huge numbers \nwho did.\n\n       My squadron alone has already put numerous sailors ashore \n     to assist with the loading and moving of the helos. I have \n     never been so proud to be a member of the US military. We \n     often are focused on keeping the peace and deterring evil \n     acts. To now be able to have a direct impact in saving lives \n     and attempt to rebuild a society is a testament to the United \n     States' amazing resolve and capabilities.\n       I thank you all for your efforts and your support. Please \n     continue to keep the Indonesians in your thoughts and \n     prayers. As of today this country alone is approaching \n     100,000 deaths from this disaster--we need to do all that is \n     possible to mitigate any further suffering or loss of life.\n\n  Signed: CDR T.R. Williams, Executive Officer, deployed aboard the USS \nAbraham Lincoln. \n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire e-mail that I \nread from be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     From: Glackin, Brian CDR AAUSN-PTGN (FM) \n         [mailto:brian.glackin@navy.mil]\n     Sent: Thursday, January 13, 2005 7:08 AM\n     To: Cochran, Thad (Cochran)\n     Subject: FW: Tsunami update from the Lincoln\n       Senator, Below is a letter from a fellow naval aviator and \n     good friend explaining his role in the Tsunami relief \n     efforts.

As \n     soon as we were aware of the horrible destruction we departed \n     Hong Kong and headed South at best speed--without any \n     official request from governments. As we proceeded, we were \n     completely unaware of what we could do or even if we would be \n     needed, but we continued through the Strait of Malacca \n     enroute to Indonesia and Thailand. Our mission was quickly \n     defined and we were tasked to assist Indonesia as best as \n     able. To do so we requested volunteers aboard the ship to \n     assist. The response as you can imagine was overwhelming as \n     all sailors want to do is help any way possible. We also knew \n     that this would be a job for the SH-60 Helicopters we have \n     aboard. We have currently shut down the flying for all \n     carrier fixed wing aircraft (that's me) as there was no \n     mission or request. For the first time in my 17 year Naval \n     career, I have seen us stop flying tactical fixed wing \n     aircraft--the primary purpose of an aircraft carrier--\n     completely as all of our focus is on this disaster.\n       We arrived off the north shore of Indonesia on the morning \n     of January 1st. I was in the first wave of helos sent ashore \n     to establish a logistical hub and move supplies from Banda \n     Aceh airport--only a few miles from the destroyed north coast \n     of the island. Not knowing what to expect as we lifted off \n     the deck, we were quickly given a glimpse as we could see \n     numerous corpses floating in the water. There were large \n     clusters of debris that looked like one time houses floating \n     in piles scattered all over the ocean. As we approached the \n     decimated shore we saw a cargo ship that was at least 300 \n     feet long capsized on the beach. Proceeding further inland we \n     were amazed that the coastal town was gone, You could see \n     outlines of where foundations once were, but as the \n     earthquake shook them loose, the Tsunamis washed everything \n     out to sea. As we continued inland, the devastation was \n     evident more than 2 miles from the coast. We then approached \n     very green and lush mountains--a sharp contrast to the \n     leveled brown terrain of the decimated coast. We climbed in \n     the helos over these 2,000 foot peaks and entered an area of \n     surreal, beautiful countryside.\n       We arrived at the airport to a scene of confusion and near \n     chaos. Six days after the disaster and there was no \n     infrastructure in place to assist these people. About 500 \n     displaced Indonesians who had survived had made their way to \n     the airport in search of a flight out of the area southeast \n     to the safe havens of Medan or Jakarta where there is little \n     or no damage.\n       Upon arrival, there was only one other American military \n     member at the airport--an Army Major who had made his way up \n     from the Embassy in Jakarta. A few Australians were already \n     there and had set up a basic logistics hub to accept \n     supplies. The Indonesian military had a base here as well and \n     were accepting supplies but had no way other than trucks \n     which could not travel on the destroyed roads to move the \n     food and water.\n       Being a Prowler pilot with no helicopter flying abilities, \n     I was sent in to be the Carrier Air Wing Two liaison to move \n     supplies! Realizing there was no one to liaise with, myself \n     and my squadron mate, Lt. Ken ``Jub'' Velez became the \n     primary coordinators to make this relief effort happen. \n     Arriving at 0900, we were able to coordinate with the \n     Indonesians and the NGO's (Non-Government Organizations), \n     and within an hour have our first load of relief supplies \n     moving down the west coast. The two primary NGO's USAID \n     and IOM (International Organization of Migration) have \n     been invaluable in the establishing of assistance. They \n     have a small medical tent with trained doctors capable of \n     triaging and stabilizing patients.\n       US AID has amazing logistical support to gather supplies \n     from all over the world. The one thing both of these \n     organizations lacked was the ability to distribute supplies \n     to the people in need. That is were we came into play.\n       We have set up a system now to have twelve of our \n     Helicopters flying from sunrise to sunset to assist. We have \n     been carrying everything from biscuits, rice, noodles, milk, \n     water and medical supplies. We transport doctors and medical \n     staff as well. The Indonesian people are in need of \n     everything.\n\n[[Page S3395]]\n\n     Their homes along the coast have been washed away and we are \n     finding them wondering aimlessly with no ability to acquire \n     food, water or badly needed medical assistance. They all lack \n     the ability to communicate as all phone lines are destroyed \n     and there is no electricity. As our pilots drop off these \n     supplies there are stories of the Indonesians hugging them \n     with relief and joy. Our pilots then fly north to return back \n     to Banda Aceh for resupply and they are finding small pockets \n     of personnel who do not have any aid. They are able to pick \n     many of them up and fly them to Banda Aceh. Most are near \n     death. Yesterday we had a helo land with seven badly injured \n     or dehydrated personnel all in critical condition. One was a \n     7 year old little girl. The doctors told me we saved her life \n     as she would not have lived through the night. I couldn't \n     help but think of my beautiful daughters and it was then that \n     I realized the gravity of what we really were doing.\n       We will continue this effort as long as we are needed. It \n     is difficult to imagine shifting back to fixed wing flight \n     ops and leaving the area any time soon as the work to be done \n     is almost insurmountable. We have been working hard with the \n     hordes of press who badly need to tell this story. I enlisted \n     the support of my squadron mate, LCDR Dave ``Smack'' Edgarton \n     to specifically deal with the media. With every flight of two \n     that we send down the coast, we embark a two man journalist \n     team, as well as member of the IOM to coordinate with any \n     injured or displaced persons who need our help. Yesterday we \n     hosted Dan Rather and his CBS crew for a 60 minutes evening \n     magazine special he was doing that should air sometime \n     this week in the states. I had breakfast with Mr. Rather \n     aboard the carrier as we discussed the days' events and \n     what he would like to see. He and his staff's graciousness \n     and professionalism impressed me. We have flown Mike \n     Chinoy from CNN and correspondents from all the major U.S. \n     and international networks and newspapers. If something is \n     coming from Banda Aceh, the U.S. Navy has helped them get \n     their story.\n       I must say a few words about the volunteer effort here--it \n     is truly an effort of amazement. I see on the news the \n     incredible outpouring of support from the U.S.--it is a \n     wonderful and necessary thing. The effort here at sea is \n     equally as impressive. These young sailors are all extremely \n     eager to get ashore and do whatever is needed despite the \n     threat of disease and the obvious destruction. My squadron \n     alone has already put numerous sailors ashore to assist with \n     the loading and moving of the helos. I have never been so \n     proud to be a member of the U.S. military. We often are \n     focused on keeping the peace and deterring evil acts. To now \n     be able to have a direct impact in saving lives and attempt \n     to rebuild a society is a testament to the United States' \n     amazing resolve and capabilities. I thank you all for your \n     efforts and your support.\n       Please continue to keep the Indonesians in your thoughts \n     and prayers. As of today this country alone is approaching \n     100,000 deaths from this disaster--we need to do all that is \n     possible to mitigate any further suffering or loss of life.\n           My best to all,\n                                                CDR T.R. Williams,\n                                       Executive Officer, VAQ-131.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. This bill before the Senate contains funds that help \nreplenish the accounts that were depleted by our agencies that were \nactively involved in the tsunami relief. We are asking in the bill for \nthe Senate to approve about $1 billion for related activities that were \ninvolved in that operation. The military, of course, incurred costs, \ntoo, and we hope this bill will help make up the difference in their \naccounts so they will continue to be able to protect our security \ninterests around the world.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this is the first appropriations bill \nbrought to the floor under the chairmanship of my good friend, the \nsenior Senator from the great State of Mississippi, Thad Cochran. He \nhas scrubbed the numbers so that, as he has pointed out, the bill is \nunder both the President's request and the House of Representatives \nallowance. I commend Senator Cochran for his efforts. This was not \neasy. He has been fairminded. He has been evenhanded in the processing \nof this bill.\n  I will say a few words about our former chairman, the very \ndistinguished Senator from the State of Alaska, Ted Stevens. Because of \nthe committee chair term limits imposed under the Republican Caucus, \nTed Stevens has taken over the reins of the Senate Commerce Committee. \nHe will do a good job there.\n  He is always up to the deed, up to the moment. He carries his \nresponsibilities manfully, nobly, and he never forgets the Constitution \nof the United States, the fact that this Government is under that \nConstitution, that the separation of powers is a part of that \nConstitution, that the Senate is equal to the House of Representatives, \nand they make up the Congress of the United States, and that the \nCongress is equal to each of the other branches, the executive branch \nand the judicial branch.\n  But Senator Stevens, although he has left the chairmanship, and had \nto leave by virtue of the Republican Caucus rules, still serves on the \nAppropriations Committee. He chairs the Subcommittee on Defense. He \nvery ably chairs that subcommittee. He has had a lot of experience. He \nknows what he is doing, and he has a mind that is like a tar bucket. \nEverything that hits it sticks to it. He will continue to be a power. \nHe has served and he continues to serve the people of Alaska with honor \nand dignity as their Senator.\n  Both of these men, the former chairman and the current chairman, are \ntrue gentlemen to the depths of their hearts in their relations with \ntheir colleagues. We know they are fair, and we are grateful for that.\n  Senator Cochran has worked hard to produce this fiscal year 2005 \nemergency supplemental appropriations bill. As he explained, it totals \n$80,581,832,000. That is $1,460,796,000 below the President's budget \nrequest and $785,046,000 below the House-passed bill. The supplemental \nbill that is before the Senate includes over $74.4 billion for the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  I must say that our men and women in uniform are indeed among the \nfinest of our country's citizens. I heard the chairman read the letter \nfrom a man who was instrumental in helping the people who had been \ndisadvantaged by the recent tsunami. This man was on a helicopter. He \nhelped move that fixed-wing aircraft into the various parts of one of \nthe islands or more than one perhaps.\n  I was there 50 years ago. I had to sleep in the mosquito cages, and I \nlooked at a huge tarantula crawling around and listened to lizards over \nin the windows rustling about in the room in which I was to sleep. \nWell, this is terribly hot. Gee whiz, when I went there you had to lie \ndown. You did not have enough energy to walk around. You slept in \nmosquito cages.\n  Well, think of what this man who wrote the letter was going through \non the helicopter. He was on a mission of mercy--mercy--thank God. I \nsalute him for that letter. What a graphic story of what was going on, \nand the service our men and women were performing. I salute them for \ntheir valor. I thank them for their service.\n\n  But we owe our troops more than mere gratitude for a job well done. \nWe owe our troops the confidence of a clearly defined military mission, \none that has measurable goals and benchmarks and, more importantly, one \nthat has an identifiable endpoint. In short, we owe our troops--our men \nand women, our magnificent troops--in Iraq not only the resources with \nwhich to fight the war but also a strategy to end that war. I was never \nin favor of it in the beginning, but that is a matter of record and \nhistory.\n  Unfortunately, the President's supplemental budget request fails to \ndeliver what our troops need most. The President is asking the Congress \nto continue to shovel out money into United States military operations \nin Iraq with no further clarity as to what goals the military is \nexpected to achieve, no hint--not even a hint--of a possible timetable, \nand no end to the occupation in sight.\n  The recent elections in Iraq gave the United States a unique window \nof opportunity to change course in order to lower the profile of the \nAmerican military presence and to open the door to greater \ninternational cooperation. But the administration, despite all of its \nconciliatory gestures to our European allies, has effectively \nsquandered that opportunity.\n  The very size of this supplemental request sends a clear message that \nthe United States is not winding down its military operations in Iraq. \nInstead, the United States appears to be gearing up either to \naccommodate a permanent military presence in Iraq or to establish a \nlaunching pad for other military operations in the region. Oh, how \nlong--how long--is this going to continue in this fashion? Either way, \nwe are sending the wrong signals to the people of Iraq, to its \nneighbors in the region, and to the larger international community.\n  Instead of taking this opportunity to temper anti-American sentiment\n\n[[Page S3396]]\n\namong disaffected Iraqis and their neighbors, the administration has \nturned up the heat, and now the Iraqis are saying: Get out. Leave us \nalone. Come back some other day, but let us alone. Let us alone. Those \nprotests are mounting. The administration has turned up the heat with \nthe construction of new military facilities in Iraq and the \nconstruction of the most costly Embassy in the world in Iraq, a country \nof only 25 million inhabitants.\n  You taxpayers out there who are watching this debate through those \nmagnificent lenses, it is your money, your sons, your daughters.\n  I am troubled by many aspects of this request. I want to support our \ntroops. I fully intend to support our troops. I would not think of \ndoing otherwise. They are there. They have been there too long. Few of \nthem asked to go there, but they are there. They are the empty chairs \nat the table on Thanksgiving, on Christmas, on holy days--empty chairs.\n  I am not willing to give the executive branch carte blanche to run \nroughshod over the Congress and to pursue policies never debated fully \non this floor.\n  The request sent to the Congress by this administration contained \n``ambiguous flexibilities'' to spend money on unspecified activities \nwith little or no involvement of the Members of Congress. I am grateful \nthat Chairman Cochran has responded to my entreaties to limit these \nextraordinary authorities. I suggest the committee bill still goes too \nfar.\n  The President also requested, and the bill still includes, ambitious \npolicy initiatives, including the construction of a permanent maximum \nsecurity prison at Guantanamo, Cuba, and a host of seemingly enduring \nmilitary facilities in Iraq. Why? The courts have yet to determine what \nthe legal status is of detainees from the war on terrorism or whether \nthe United States can continue to hold them indefinitely without \ncharging them with any specific crime. Yet this bill includes $36 \nmillion to build a permanent prison facility at Guantanamo Bay. I went \nthere years ago. These are policy decisions, not simply pocketbook \nissues. Decisions to build permanent facilities should not be made via \nan emergency supplemental appropriations bill.\n  In fact, the White House has turned on its head the definition of an \nemergency supplemental appropriation. In his budget, the President \ncalls on Congress to deploy a stricter standard for what constitutes \nemergency spending, spending that is thus excluded from constraints on \nspending. He urges the Congress to only approve emergency spending for \nactivities that are ``necessary expenditures, sudden, urgent, \nunforeseen, and not permanent.'' Yet the President has asked the \nCongress to approve funding for the most expensive U.S. Embassy in the \nworld. And he hasn't done it in a regular bill; he has done it in an \nemergency war supplemental. This Embassy would be larger than the U.S. \nEmbassy in Russia, larger than the U.S. Embassy in China, larger than \nthe U.S. Embassy in Saudi Arabia, and 10 times the size of most U.S. \nEmbassies. Funds to staff that Embassy, which will not be needed until \nfiscal year 2006, are also requested in this emergency bill. As noted \nearlier, to build a permanent prison at Guantanamo Bay is also \nrequested.\n  A supplemental bill is being used to tunnel deeper and deeper and \ndeeper into Iraq with no definitive exit strategy in sight and no light \non the horizon. This request encompasses serious and far-reaching \npolicy questions, and we are having it shoved down our throats.\n  Moreover, on July 17, 2003, the Senate voted 81 to 15 for my \namendment expressing the sense of the Senate that the President should \nrequest funds for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan--they are two \ndifferent wars--in the regular budget, rather than through emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bills.\n  On June 24, 2004, I offered the same sense-of-the-Senate amendment \nwhich was approved by an even wider margin in the Senate by a vote of \n89 to 9. Both sides joined in. Republicans and Democrats joined in that \nvote. It was 89 to 9. These are strong, emphatic, definitive votes. \nThis provision was included in both the fiscal year 2004 and fiscal \nyear 2005 Defense Appropriations Acts. I didn't put those words in \nthose acts alone. It was with the support of Republicans and Democrats \non both sides of the aisle. So much for the views of the Senate.\n  Instead, the White House chose to seek an $81.9 billion emergency \nsupplemental for fiscal year 2005 and requested nothing for the war for \nfiscal year 2006. This is not truth in budgeting. This is not leveling \nwith the American people about their money. This is not truth in \nbudgeting. This is hocus-pocus. Now you see it; now you don't. It is \nnot there.\n  Tactics such as this hide the real cost of the wars. I say it to you \npeople out there who are watching through those lenses, watching the \nmost deliberative body, upper body in the world today--and I hope it \nremains that way; I hope the nuclear option is pushed aside--tactics \nlike this, putting these requests into emergency supplementals, hiding \nthe real costs of the wars. The American people don't see those costs. \nThat is wrong. That is not being fair with the American people. That is \nnot being honest with the American people. That is not being \nstraightforward with the American people. That is not laying it on the \nline with the people who are going to pay the cost.\n  By seeking $81.9 billion as an emergency supplemental, rather than in \nhis budget, the President avoids a debate about priorities and how the \nwar should be paid for. By seeking an $81.9 billion emergency \nsupplemental for the war, by asking for that much money in an emergency \nsupplemental for the war in Iraq, the President avoids any discussion \nof the tradeoffs that are inherent in a decision to spend another $81.9 \nbillion on defense and foreign aid.\n  If the President's emergency request for 2005 is approved, the \nCongress will have approved over $210 billion just for the war in Iraq. \nHow much is $210 billion? That is $210 for every minute since Jesus \nChrist was born 2,000 years ago. How much is it? That is $210 for every \nminute that has passed since Jesus Christ was born 2,000 years ago.\n\n  While the budget deficit grows to record levels, the President tells \nus we have to cut domestic programs by $192 billion over the next 5 \nyears. The President tells us we have to charge veterans--those brave \nmen and women--for their medical care, and we have to cut grants for \nfirefighters and first responders, that we cannot adequately fund the \nNo Child Left Behind Act, and that we should cut funding for the \nNational Institutes of Health.\n  For fiscal year 2006, the President fails to request any funding for \nthe two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. I will say that again. For fiscal \nyear 2006, the President fails to request any funding for the wars in \nIraq and Afghanistan. The President pretends that he cannot project \nwhat the war will cost in 2006. Well, I assure the American people the \ncosts will not be zero. The President will not tell the American people \nwhat the war in Iraq will cost. No, he will not tell the American \npeople what the war will cost in Iraq. It is your money, I say to the \npeople of this country. Republicans, Democrats, Independents, whatever \nyou will, it is your money.\n  Nor will the President give the American people a plan for getting \nout of Iraq. How long are the American people going to suffer under the \nweight of this colossal burden? The President continues to insist on \nborrowing the money to fund the war in Iraq 1 year at a time through \nemergency supplemental appropriations requests. So far, the Department \nof Defense has received appropriations of $16 billion, $14 billion, $7 \nbillion, $10 billion, $63 billion, $65 billion, and $25 billion for the \ncosts of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq--all emergency spending, one \npiece at a time, and all of it, adding to our horrendous debt. What a \nshame. What a colossal shame.\n  In his budget for fiscal year 2006, the President's only plan to help \npay for his tax cuts and his war in Iraq is to slash that small portion \nof the budget that pays for priorities at home. In order to hide the \nconsequences of his proposed cuts in domestic programs--cuts of $192 \nbillion over 5 years--the President's budget excludes the details that \nare traditionally included in the budget. However, based on data the \nOffice of Management and Budget has provided to the Congress on the \nlevels of funding in each of the next 5 years, the Center on Budget and \nPolicy Priorities has studied the impact of the proposed cuts.\n\n[[Page S3397]]\n\n  Adjusted for inflation for 2010, when the President's proposed \nreductions would reach their full dimensions, education funding for \nkindergarten through the 12th grade would be cut by $4.6 billion or 12 \npercent. Grants to States and localities would be cut by nearly $22 \nbillion in 2010. The number of low-income women, infants, and young \nchildren receiving assistance through the WIC supplemental nutrition \nprogram would be cut, cut, cut by $670,000. The number of children in \nlow-income working families who receive childcare assistance would be \ncut, cut, cut by $300,000. The number of low-income families, elderly \npeople, and people with disabilities who receive rental assistance \nthrough the provision of rental vouchers that help them to afford \nmodest apartments would be cut, cut, cut by $370,000. Environmental \nprotection would be reduced by 23 percent, including EPA programs that \nsupport State and local efforts to ensure clean drinking water, reduce \nair pollution, and upgrade sewage treatment facilities which would be \nsliced 28 percent.\n  I call on the President--Mr. President, I say this to the President \nin the White House--to send Congress a budget amendment this week that \nincludes his estimates for the real costs of the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. There are tradeoffs we are making to fund these efforts to \nthe tune of about $1 billion a week. There needs to be a debate about \nthat. The issue becomes crystal clear when these war costs are shown as \npart of the regular budget process. As we consider the budget for \nfiscal year 2006, Congress should understand the full cost of the wars.\n  I want to say that again. I shall say it again. As we consider the \nbudget for fiscal year 2006, Congress should understand and the \nAmerican people should understand the full costs of the wars, and \nespecially the war in Iraq, so that we, the Members of Congress, can \nmake reasoned spending choices so that we can inform our constituents \nabout how we plan to pay for those choices.\n  Again, I thank my chairman. I thank the staff, the magnificent staff \nof the Appropriations Committee, the staff who worked hard to help our \nchairman and to help me and to help the members of our Appropriations \nCommittee in our efforts to bring this full bill to the floor.\n  The majority staff is led by Keith Kennedy. There is a man, Keith \nKennedy. He knows what he is doing. He knows this bill up and down and \nsideways. Keith Kennedy. I am gratified that the chair has chosen him, \nand I am also thankful to the chair that he has chosen a man like Mr. \nKennedy.\n  I am also thankful for the minority staff, led by Terry Sauvain, that \nman from Notre Dame, and a deputy named Chuck Kieffer. He has worked on \nboth the legislative and executive sides. He knows the appropriations \nprocess inside, outside, from the executive branch viewpoint and from \nthe legislative side. I thank all of the members of the appropriations \nstaff on both sides of the aisle. I thank the Chair, and I thank all \nSenators. Again, I thank my illustrious chairman.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee-reported substitute be agreed to and be considered as \noriginal text for the purpose of further amendments and that no points \nof order be waived by virtue of this agreement.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, that request is supported on this side of \nthe aisle 100 percent.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I compliment and thank most sincerely my \nfriend from West Virginia, the distinguished senior Democratic member \nof the Appropriations Committee, for his support during the committee \nmarkup in terms of the procedures for the consideration of the House-\npassed bill. We substituted a complete text in the committee markup for \nthe House bill and proceeded to consider amendments to that text. We \nmade some changes in that House bill, as is reflected by the total \namount we are recommending be appropriated in the bill by the Senate.\n  We bring the bill in below the level of funds requested by the \nPresident for this bill, and it is below the level approved by the \nHouse of Representatives. We hope Senators will consider their ideas \nfor changes or improvements in the bill. We are not attempting to rush \nthe Senate to completion of action on this bill, but we do want to move \nahead with dispatch so we can get the funds that are provided in this \nbill to the agencies where they are needed, to the Department of \nDefense and the Department of State for depleted accounts.\n  The challenges we face in Iraq and Afghanistan have been costly, as \nwe all recognize, but we need to move forward to a successful \nconclusion of those operations so that troops can be returned home as \nsoon as possible, so that stability can be restored in that and other \nregions of the world, and so that the economy of those countries can be \nfree flowing once again.\n  In that connection, I was heartened to receive a call from the \nSecretary of Agriculture last week advising me that the interim \ngovernment in Iraq had decided to purchase 60,000 tons of rice from the \nUnited States. This is an indication, it seems to me, that their \neconomy is beginning to move forward, that the Iraqi Government and the \npeople of Iraq are moving toward the day when they will be able to \nstand on their own two feet, that they will be able to take care of \nthemselves from a security standpoint and in every other way be a \nfunctioning entity in that region for stability and economic progress. \nThat is the goal; that is the purpose of the sacrifices we are making \ntoday--to make this world safer for all people.\n\n  I compliment the President and the leadership of his Cabinet--\nparticularly Secretary Rumsfeld and Secretary Rice--as they carry out \nthe missions of the Departments of Defense and State at this very \ndifficult time. Now is not the time for the Senate to start eroding the \nconfidence we have in the challenges we face and the way we are \nproceeding to meet those challenges. I believe we are making good \nprogress, and we ought to compliment the administration for the work \nthey have done in this very difficult period in our Nation's history.\n  I urge the Senate to approve this substitute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am pleased to come to the floor to \nsupport the defense portion of the emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill before us. I thank Senator Cochran and Senator Byrd \nfor their support of the funding requested by the Pentagon to continue \nthe efforts of our Nation in Iraq and Afghanistan and the global war on \nterrorism.\n  The bill has been highlighted by the chairman and Senator Byrd. It \nprovides $73.3 billion in new discretionary spending authority for the \nDepartment of Defense programs. Most of those funds are to continue the \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan, but we also have authorized use of \nthat to pay back those accounts from which funds were borrowed during \nthe first half of the current fiscal year on an emergency basis for \ncontinued operations in those areas.\n  Mr. President, $17.5 billion of this money will go toward military \nappropriations accounts. Those moneys are used to fund pay allowances \nand subsistence and other personnel costs for active Guard and Reserve \ntroops activated for duty throughout the world.\n  This bill also includes funding for special pay, such as imminent \ndanger pay, family separation allowances, and hardship duty pay.\n  We also provide additional funds for the Servicemembers' Group Life \nInsurance Program and for an enhanced death gratuity. Specifically, \nthis bill increases service members' insurance coverage from $250,000 \nto $400,000 and raises the death gratuity from $12,000 to $100,000. \nThis has been requested, and Congress has authorized to fund these \nenhanced benefits to cover those military personnel who have been or \nmay be killed in combat operations.\n\n  We recommend an increase in the death gratuity benefit to cover those \nservice members killed in training or in other combat-related \nactivities. Almost half of the defense portion of this bill goes toward \nthe operation and maintenance accounts of the Department of Defense--\n$37.4 billion. Now,\n\n[[Page S3398]]\n\nthis reflects the cost of ground operations, flying hours, logistics \nsupport, fuel, travel, transportation, and support of the global war on \nterrorism.\n  Additionally, it will finance the repair and refurbishment of \nequipment used in Iraq and Afghanistan to ensure that our forces remain \nready to meet global operational commitments.\n  The bill provides $15.9 billion for procurement activity across the \nmilitary. It funds force protection equipment, replacement and repair \nof equipment lost in operations, and the equipping of units to support \nupcoming rotations. Senior Department of Defense officials informed our \ncommittee that they need to receive this supplemental funding by early \nMay in order not to impact readiness levels.\n  We all know it will take some time to take this bill through \nconference, so I urge the Senate to complete action on the supplemental \nbill as soon as possible so that we can proceed to confer with our \nfriends in the House and give this bill to the President for signature \nso it can be reviewed by the processes downtown, which takes at least \n10 days, and get this money to the Department in time to meet these \ncontingencies so they don't have to borrow additional moneys from other \naccounts. It complicates the operation when that continues.\n  I hope Senators will come forward with their amendments, if they have \nany, on this portion of the supplemental bill.\n  Again, I commend our distinguished chairman and senior ranking \nmember, Senator Cochran and Senator Byrd, for their cooperation with us \nin bringing this portion of this bill before the Senate. We are a \nlittle bit lower than the House, and the bill is lower than the \nPresident's request. I think as matters continue we are going to have \nto review the numbers and make sure we meet the pressing, urgent needs \nof those who wear the uniform of the United States.\n  Again, I urge Senators to come forward and make suggestions for \namendments, if they have them. I look forward to continued support of \nthis bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Hawaii is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the bill before us, as noted by the \nSenator from Alaska, includes $74.4 billion. Of that amount, $73.3 \nbillion is under the jurisdiction of the Subcommittee on Defense.\n  The vast majority of this funding, approximately $42.5 billion, is \nrecommended to cover the costs of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nWith 150,000 military personnel in Iraq and another 18,000 in \nAfghanistan, the funding included in this bill is essential to support \nour forces.\n  The bill also includes $12 billion to repair and replace equipment \ndamaged in the operations abroad. This funding will allow the military \ndepartments to reequip our forces who are returning from \ncombat. Without these funds, our military would not be equipped to meet \nfuture crises.\n\n  The bill provides $5.3 billion for new equipment for our Army and \nMarine forces as they restructure their forces to create additional \ncombat capability. While some may question whether these funds qualify \nas emergencies, it should be clear that our military forces will need \nthese funds as they begin restructuring transformation.\n  Finally, the remaining funds are provided to support those nations \nwhich are taking part in the operations abroad, including training and \nequipping the Afghanis and Iraqis, and to support related efforts for \nrecruiting, morale welfare, recreation, and other military personnel \nneeds.\n  I support this bill, and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this measure. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/11/senate-section/article/S3398-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3398-S3401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 F_____\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF PAUL A. CROTTY TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE \n                     SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now go into executive session for the consideration of \nExecutive Calendar No. 38, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Paul A. \nCrotty, of New York, to be United States District Judge for the \nSouthern District of New York.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill be 30 minutes of debate equally divided between the chairman and \nranking member of the Committee on the Judiciary or their designees.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of an extremely \nfine gentleman, Paul Crotty, to be confirmed to the Southern District \nof the New York bench. Paul Crotty is a fine man, an outstanding \nlawyer, and he will make a terrific judge. Paul Crotty is an impressive \nnominee who has long enjoyed strong bipartisan support for a judgeship \nin New York. I am glad that at long last his nomination has finally \nbeen brought to the floor for a vote after languishing since last \nNovember.\n  First, I would like to talk a little bit about Paul Crotty. He has \nthe support of not only myself and Senator Clinton, he has the support \nof a broad range of New Yorkers, in fact. I personally would like to \nthank two who worked religiously on behalf of Paul Crotty's nomination, \ntwo former mayors of New York City, one a Democrat and one a \nRepublican. They are Mayor Ed Koch and Mayor Rudy Giuliani.\n  Both had worked with Paul Crotty when they were mayor, and both speak \nextremely highly of him. In fact, I would like to read from the letter, \nfor instance, that Mayor Giuliani sent:\n\n       Paul Crotty is one of the finest men I know. He possesses \n     all the qualities of an excellent judge--wisdom, compassion, \n     toughness, curiosity, common sense, unwavering integrity, and \n     an abiding love of the law. . . . Many possess knowledge of \n     the law or knowledge of government. Paul Crotty is the rare \n     individual who possesses mastery of both. He has set and \n     achieved the highest standards at every stage of his career. \n     Our Nation will be fortunate to have him join the Federal \n     bench.\n\n  I don't have Mayor Koch's letter, but it was Mayor Koch who suggested \nto me the idea that Paul Crotty be nominated to the bench. I knew Paul \nin many different walks of life and thought it was a great idea and was \nhappy to not only support his nomination but to work hard to see that \nit would pass.\n  Let me tell you a little bit about Paul Crotty. He has had a long and \ndistinguished career in both the public and private sectors of the New \nYork legal community. He graduated from Cornell Law School in 1967. He \nclerked 2 years for U.S. District Court Judge Lloyd MacMahon of the \nSouthern District, the court to which he is now nominated. He served in \ncity government as Mayor Koch's commissioner of finance and \ncommissioner of housing. He was a partner in the very prestigious New \nYork law firm of Donovan Leisure Newton Irvin.\n  He went on to serve Mayor Giuliani as New York City's corporation \ncounsel and the head of the city's law department, perhaps the single \nmost difficult legal job in municipal government anywhere in America.\n  Mr. President, Paul Crotty is an incredible choice. I have known him \nfor a long time. He is smart, compassionate, decent. He has the two \nqualities I look for in a judge: a fine and deep intellect and a \npractical sense. Sometimes I worry that judges without practical \nexperience impose things on Government or on society that cannot work, \neven though they might sound fine when you see it in writing and in \nblack and white.\n  Paul's extensive and practical experience, as well as his legal \nexperience, makes him a perfect candidate for a judge in the district \ncourt in the Southern District of New York, one of the most important \ncourts in the country.\n  I want to make one other point. In New York, Paul Crotty's nomination \nis not the exception, it is the rule. We have worked extremely well \ntogether--the White House, the Justice Department, and the Senator from \nNew\n\n[[Page S3399]]\n\nYork--to bring judges to the floor. There have been no vacancies that \nhave been outstanding for a long period of time in either the Second \nCircuit, which I know my good friend and colleague, the ranking member, \nSenator Leahy, is part of as well, nor have there been in the four \ndistrict courts of New York in the East, Northwest, and South.\n  I think we have worked together well on this Crotty nomination. In \ngeneral, we have worked well together in New York. The White House and \nSenate, including Democrats in the Senate, can work well together to \nbring fine men and women to the bench.\n  The candidates who have been nominated in the Second Circuit and in \nthe courts of New York--I don't agree with them on everything at all, \nbut they are fine people. They are qualified people, and I would say \nnone of them are at the extremes--either far right or far left. They \nare not the kind of ideologues who seek to make law. They are, rather, \nthe kind of people the Founding Fathers wanted to see on the bench, \npeople who would interpret the law.\n  Judges have awesome power, and judges on the Federal level have a \nlifetime appointment. You combine those two and you know you need \npeople who don't think they know better than the public, that they know \nbetter than the Congress, that they know better than others. They \ninterpret law; they don't make law. Paul Crotty exemplifies this. I am \nproud to support his nomination. I hope he will get unanimous support \non the floor of the Senate. I know he will make an outstanding judge.\n  I congratulate Paul Crotty for his great career, and his wife, his \nchildren, and the entire Crotty family, who are well known in New York \nfor their public service from one end of the State in Buffalo, where \nthe family originally came from, to the other end in New York City.\n  I yield the floor to our ranking member, Senator Leahy.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom New York, Mrs. Clinton, be recognized, but that I retain the last \n5 minutes of the time before the vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from New York, Mrs. Clinton, is recognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and our ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee. I, too, am enthusiastic about this \nnominee. This is a supremely qualified judicial nominee, and he will \nserve with great distinction in the Southern District in New York. He \ndoes hail from a family and tradition of public service, and his \nhometown of Buffalo is particularly pleased this vote is about to \noccur.\n  Mr. President, he has distinguished himself in both the public and \nthe private sectors. He served for years as a practicing attorney in \nNew York City. He has served as a counsel for a major corporation, and \nhe has always served his community. After the attack of September 11, \nPaul Crotty signed on to serve on the Lower Manhattan Development Board \nto help Lower Manhattan recover from those devastating attacks. He has \nbeen active in organizations, such as the New York Urban League, City \nBar Fund, and the Tri-State United Way. He worked very closely with \nMayor Ed Koch, first as commissioner of financial services, and then as \ncommissioner of housing preservation and development.\n  He later served as corporation counsel to Mayor Giuliani, during \nwhich he advised the mayor on a wide variety of issues. So, without \nquestion, Paul Crotty has the intellect, demeanor, and commitment to \njustice to serve the people of New York and America with distinction.\n  I, also, congratulate the entire Crotty family: Paul's wife Jane, his \nchildren John, Elizabeth, and David, his daughter-in-law Katherine, and \nhis brothers Bob and Jerry, because this is a family accomplishment. \nThe Crotty family, which extends far beyond the names I have \nmentioned--there are too many to enumerate--is a very close-knit \nfamily. I know how much pride they take in this nomination. Paul's \nfather, Peter J. Crotty, who passed away in 1992, was a great political \nleader in New York. He instilled in his children that sense of \ntradition.\n  Finally, I want to acknowledge Paul's mother Margaret who is 92 years \nold and still lives in Buffalo. She has been and remains a tremendous \ninfluence in Paul Crotty's life and that of the entire Crotty family.\n  With this nomination today, Mr. President, the Senate will have \nconfirmed 205 of the judicial nominations sent to the Senate by the \nPresident. I am very pleased we were all able to come together across \nthe aisle to unanimously, I hope, support someone who is so well \nqualified for this lifetime appointment. Again, I thank my friend and \ncolleague from Vermont, and I yield back my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to see the Senate finally be \nable to vote on the nomination of Paul Crotty to be a U.S. District \nCourt Judge for the Southern District of New York. The seat to which \nMr. Crotty has been nominated has been unnecessarily vacant for months, \nand Democrats have been asked for months now, since last year, for this \nnominee to be considered, debated, voted on and confirmed.\n  As I have noted in earlier statements in the Judiciary Committee, \namong this President's renominations there are two noncontroversial \njudicial nominations on which we should have been able to make \nimmediate progress. I have often spoken of the President's nomination \nof Mr. Crotty to the District Court for the Southern District of New \nYork and the nomination of Michael Seabright to the District Court of \nHawaii. All Democrats on the Judiciary Committee have been prepared to \nvote favorably on these nominations for some time. We were prepared to \nreport them last year, but they were not listed by the then-chairman on \nthe committee agenda. I thank Chairman Specter for including them at \nour meeting on March 17.\n  Last week I noted that both these consensus nominations were \ncontinuing to languish without action on the Senate calendar and that \nthe Senate Republican leadership was refusing to work with us to \nschedule them for action. I thank the Senate Republican leadership for \nbeing willing to turn to the Crotty nomination this evening. I hope \nthat they will not make Mr. Seabright, the people of Hawaii and the \nHawaii District Court wait much longer before we are allowed to \nconsider, debate and confirm Michael Seabright, as well.\n  Once confirmed, Mr. Crotty will be the 205th of 215 nominees brought \nbefore the full Senate for a vote to be confirmed. That means that 829 \nof the 875 authorized judgeships in the Federal judiciary, or 95 \npercent, will be filled. As late as it is in the year, we are still \nahead of the pace the Republican majority set in 1999, when President \nClinton was in the White House. That year, the Senate Republican \nleadership did not allow the Senate to consider the first judicial \nnominee until April 15.\n  Of the 46 judicial vacancies now existing, President Bush has not \neven sent nominees for 28 of those vacancies; more than half. I have \nbeen encouraging the Bush administration to work with Senators to \nidentify qualified and consensus judicial nominees and do so, again, \ntoday.\n  It is now the second week in April, we are more than one-quarter \nthrough the year, and so far the President has sent only one new \nnominee for a Federal court vacancy all year--only one. Instead of \nsending back divisive nominees, would it not be better for the country, \nthe courts, the American people, the Senate and the administration if \nthe White House would work with us to identify, and for the President \nto nominate, more consensus nominees like Paul Crotty who can be \nconfirmed quickly with strong, bipartisan votes?\n\n  I commend the Senators from New York for their ability and efforts in \nconnection with Mr. Crotty's nomination. Their support is very helpful \nand indicative of the type of bipartisan efforts Senate Democrats have \nmade with this President and remain willing to make. We can work \ntogether to fill judicial vacancies with qualified, consensus nominees. \nThe vast majority of the more than 200 judges confirmed during the last \n3\\1/2\\ years were confirmed with bipartisan support. The truth is that \nin President Bush's first term, the 204 judges confirmed were\n\n[[Page S3400]]\n\nmore than were confirmed in either of President Clinton's two terms, \nmore than during the term of this President's father, and more than in \nRonald Reagan's first term when he was being assisted by a Republican \nmajority in the Senate. By last December, we had reduced judicial \nvacancies from the 110 vacancies I inherited in the summer of 2001 to \nthe lowest level, lowest rate and lowest number in decades, since \nRonald Reagan was in office.\n  There should be no misunderstanding; Mr. Crotty has strong Republican \nties. He worked as Corporation Counsel for then-Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, \nand served in New York City government in a variety of posts over the \nyears. After the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001, Mr. Crotty \nplayed a major role in coordinating Verizon's work in restoring \ntelephone service to the New York Stock Exchange, Federal, State and \nlocal agencies and large business customers. He continues to play a \nsignificant role in Verizon's revitalization of its telephone network \nin Lower Manhattan. In 2002, Mr. Crotty led Verizon's efforts in a \ncomplex administrative proceeding to gain the New York Public Service \nCommission's authorization to rebalance retail revenues in light of the \nincreasing competition in New York's communication market.\n  Mr. Crotty has also given generously of his time and currently serves \non the Boards of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, Tri-State \nUnited Way, where he is also the Corporate Secretary, Polytechnic \nUniversity, Council of Governing Boards, St. Vincent's Hospital-\nManhattan, New York State Business Development Corporation, Regional \nPlan Association, and the New York Urban League. He has served on the \nExecutive Committee of the Association of the Bar of the City of New \nYork since 2001. In addition, Mr. Crotty serves on the Advisory Boards \nof the New York Law School and the C.U.N.Y. Irish Studies program.\n  Senate Democrats have long supported and requested action on this \nnomination. We will be delighted that the New York Senators will be \nable to call Mr. Crotty tonight and tell him that after 5 months of \nunnecessary delay the Senate finally did consider his nomination and \ngranted consent overwhelmingly. I add my congratulations to Mr. Crotty \nand his family.\n  I have been urging this President and Senate Republicans for years to \nwork with all Senators and engage in genuine, bipartisan consultation. \nThat process leads to the nomination, confirmation, and appointment of \nconsensus nominees with reputations for fairness. The Crotty \nnomination, the bipartisan support of his home State Senators and the \nSenate's act of granting its consent tonight with a strong bipartisan \nvote is a perfect example of what I have been urging.\n\n  I have noted that there are currently 28 judicial vacancies for which \nthe President has delayed sending a nominee. In fact, he has sent the \nSenate only one new judicial nominee all year. I wish he would work \nwith all Senators to fill those remaining vacancies rather than through \nhis inaction and unnecessarily confrontational approach manufacture \nlongstanding vacancies. It is as if the President and his most partisan \nsupporters want to create a crisis. Last week we heard some extremists \ncall for mass impeachments of judges, court-stripping and punishing \njudges by reducing court budgets. Rather than promote crisis and \nconfrontation, I urge that this President do what most others have and \nwork with us to identify outstanding consensus nominees. It ill serves \nthe country, the courts, and most importantly the American people for \nthis administration and the Senate Republican leadership to continue \ndown the road to conflict. The Crotty nomination shows how unnecessary \nthat conflict really is. Let us join together to debate and confirm \nthese consensus nominees to these important lifetime posts on the \nFederal judiciary.\n  It is the Federal judiciary that is called upon to rein in the \npolitical branches when their actions contravene the constitutional \nlimits on governmental authority and restrict individual rights. It is \nthe Federal judiciary that has stood up to the overreaching of this \nadministration in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. It is more \nand more the Federal judiciary that is being called upon to protect \nAmericans' rights and liberties, our environment and to uphold the rule \nof law as the political branches under the control of one party have \noverreached. Federal judges should protect the rights of all Americans, \nnot be selected to advance a partisan or personal agenda. Once the \njudiciary is filled with partisans beholden to the administration and \nwilling to reinterpret the Constitution in line with the \nadministration's demands, who will be left to protect American values \nand the rights of the American people? The Constitution establishes the \nSenate as a check and a balance on the choices of a powerful President \nwho might seek to make the Federal judiciary an extension of his \nadministration or a wholly-owned subsidiary of any political party.\n  Today, Republicans are threatening to take away one of the few \nremaining checks on the power of the executive branch by their use of \nwhat has become known as the nuclear option. This assault on our \ntradition of checks and balances and on the protection of minority \nrights in the Senate and in our democracy should be abandoned.\n  Eliminating the filibuster by the nuclear option would destroy the \nConstitution's design of the Senate as an effective check on the \nexecutive. The elimination of the filibuster would reduce any incentive \nfor a President to consult with home State Senators or seek the advice \nof the Senate on lifetime appointments to the Federal judiciary. It is \na leap not only toward one-party rule but to an unchecked executive.\n  Rather than blowing up the Senate, let us honor the constitutional \ndesign of our system of checks and balances and work together to fill \njudicial vacancies with consensus nominees. The nuclear option is \nunnecessary. What is needed is a return to consultation and for the \nWhite House to recognize and respect the role of the Senate \nappointments process.\n  The American people have begun to see this threatened partisan power \ngrab for what it is and to realize that the threat and the potential \nharm are aimed at our democracy, at an independent and strong Federal \njudiciary and, ultimately, at their rights and freedoms. Tonight's \nconfirmation is a civics lesson that shows that the Republican's \nthreatened use of the nuclear option is unnecessary and unwise.\n  Mr. President, I see the chairman of the committee on the floor. \nWhile I had the remainder of the time reserved, I will yield it to him, \nif that is possible--we are still going to vote at 5:30--if the \nchairman wishes. I yield the remainder of my time to the chairman.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority's time has expired. \nThere were 15 minutes to each side. The Senator from Pennsylvania does \nhave 15 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished ranking member \nfor his cooperation in moving the nomination of Paul A. Crotty to the \nU.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.\n  By way of a very brief reply, I came in in the middle of the comments \nby the Senator from Vermont because he and I just attended a very \nlengthy meeting on the asbestos issue. We are working very hard and \ncooperatively on many matters on the Judiciary Committee. Asbestos is \nvery high on the list. Just a brief comment there.\n  There are thousands of victims of mesothelioma who are dying and not \nbeing compensated because their companies have gone into bankruptcy. \nSome 74 companies have gone into bankruptcy, an enormous drain on the \neconomy. I think it is fair to say that we just had a positive meeting \nwith a number of Democrats and with Members of my side of the aisle. We \nare making progress.\n  I could not be here at the start of the argument because of the \ncommitment there. I came in to hear the Senator from Vermont comment \nabout the President, and I believe the President has made comments \nwhich are supportive of the Federal judiciary, as has the majority \nleader, Senator Frist, made comments supportive of the Federal \njudiciary.\n  The Schaivo case raised the emotional level very high in the United \nStates--really, beyond--for people who were on both sides of the issue. \nThe rhetoric, I am pleased to see, has cooled, at least to some extent, \nbut I believe that the Federal judiciary acquitted themselves in \naccordance with\n\n[[Page S3401]]\n\ntheir authority under separation of power, and there has been respect \nfor the judicial role expressed by both the President of the United \nStates and the majority leader of the Senate. That is enough said on \nthat subject. I had not intended to get into it to any extent, but \nhaving heard those comments, I believe it is appropriate to respond.\n  Paul Crotty has a very distinguished academic record. He has a law \ndegree from Cornell Law School, where he was a member of the Order of \nthe Coif. He then clerked for Judge Lloyd MacMahon in the Southern \nDistrict of New York. He has 35 years of legal experience. He is with \nthe very prestigious New York firm of Donovan Leisure Newton & Irvine. \nHe has had a notable career in public service, having served as a New \nYork City commissioner in two mayoral administrations, first for Ed \nKoch and later for Rudolf Giuliani. So he worked on both sides of the \naisle, Democratic and Republican.\n  He is currently the group president for New York and Connecticut of \nVerizon Communications. The American Bar Association gave him the \nhighest rating of ``well qualified.'' He has the support of both New \nYork Senators, and he has an excellent record.\n  I see the Senator from New York just arrived. He has already spoken. \nI do not have to make an act of generosity and give him 2 minutes, \nwhich will bring us to 5:30.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 10 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I intend to conclude at 5:30 so we can start the vote \nbecause there are two votes. I know people are anxious to have the \nvotes start. I do not think there is any question about Mr. Crotty \nbeing confirmed. He is an able candidate.\n  It is my hope that we will be able to move other nominees to the \nSenate floor for confirmation. The committee has reported out the \nnomination of William Myers, and it is my hope we will get an up-or-\ndown vote on Mr. Myers. There is significant opposition, which I \nunderstand.\n  We are moving to conclude the consideration of Mr. Griffith, and then \nwe have other nominees behind him.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays on this nomination.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Paul A. Crotty, of New York, to be United States District Judge for \nthe Southern District of New York?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Res. 25\n\n       Whereas Airbus is currently the leading manufacturer of \n     large civil aircraft, with a full fleet of aircraft and more \n     than 50 percent global market share;\n       Whereas Airbus has received approximately $30,000,000,000 \n     in market distorting subsidies from European governments, \n     including launch aid, infrastructure support, debt \n     forgiveness, equity infusions, and research and development \n     funding;\n       Whereas these subsidies, in particular launch aid, have \n     lowered Airbus' development costs and shifted the risk of \n     aircraft development to European governments, and thereby \n     enabled Airbus to develop aircraft at an accelerated pace and \n     sell these aircraft at prices and on terms that would \n     otherwise be unsustainable;\n       Whereas the benefit of these subsidies to Airbus is \n     enormous, including, at a minimum, the avoidance of \n     $35,000,000,000 in debt as a result of launch aid's \n     noncommercial interest rate;\n       Whereas over the past 5 years, Airbus has gained 20 points \n     of world market share and 45 points of market share in the \n     United States, all at the expense of Boeing, its only \n     competitor;\n\n[[Page S3402]]\n\n       Whereas this dramatic shift in market share has had a \n     tremendous impact, resulting in the loss of over 60,000 high-\n     paying United States aerospace jobs;\n       Whereas on October 6, 2004, the United States Trade \n     Representative filed a complaint at the World Trade \n     Organization on the basis that all of the subsidies that the \n     European Union and its Member States have provided to Airbus \n     violate World Trade Organization rules;\n       Whereas on January 11, 2005, the European Union agreed to \n     freeze the provision of launch aid and other government \n     support and negotiate with a view to reaching a \n     comprehensive, bilateral agreement covering all government \n     supports in the large civil aircraft sector;\n       Whereas the Bush administration has shown strong leadership \n     and dedication to bring about a fair resolution during the \n     negotiations;\n       Whereas Airbus received $6,200,000,000 in government \n     subsidies to build the A380;\n       Whereas Airbus has now committed to develop and produce yet \n     another new model, the A350, even before the A380 is out of \n     the development phase;\n       Whereas Airbus has stated that it does not need launch aid \n     to build the A350, but has nevertheless applied for and \n     European governments are prepared to provide $1,700,000,000 \n     in new launch aid; and\n       Whereas European governments are apparently determined to \n     target the United States aerospace sector and Boeing's \n     position in the large civil aircraft market by providing \n     Airbus with continuing support to lower its costs and reduce \n     its risk: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) European governments should reject Airbus' pending \n     application for launch aid for the A350 and any future \n     applications for launch aid;\n       (2) the European Union, acting for itself and on behalf of \n     its Member States, should renew its commitment to the terms \n     agreed to on January 11, 2005;\n       (3) the United States Trade Representative should request \n     the formation of a World Trade Organization dispute \n     resolution panel at the earliest possible opportunity if \n     there is no immediate agreement to eliminate launch aid for \n     the A350 and all future models and no concrete progress \n     toward a comprehensive bilateral agreement covering all \n     government supports in the large aircraft sector; and\n       (4) the President should take any additional action the \n     President considers appropriate to protect the interests of \n     the United States in fair competition in the large commercial \n     aircraft market.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/11/senate-section/article/S3402-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            AIRBUS SUBSIDIES\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate voted this \nafternoon in support of the resolution I submitted along with the \nDemocratic leader, Senator Reid, and the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Senate Finance Committee expressing the Senate's concern about \nvarious subsidies provided by European governments to Airbus. This \nresolution sends a strong signal that the Senate supports the \nPresident's leadership and commitment to leveling the playing field in \nthe large civil aircraft market.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the administration has been working \nhard to resolve this issue through the World Trade Organization, WTO. \nLast October, the United States filed a complaint at the WTO alleging \nthat the subsidies provided to Airbus were in violation of WTO rules. \nThis January, the European Union agreed to freeze launch aid payments \nand other support to Airbus while attempting to negotiate a \ncomprehensive agreement on government support to the civil aircraft \nsector.\n  Unfortunately, despite the heroic efforts by former U.S. Trade \nRepresentative and current Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick, \nthe negotiations begun in January have broken down. Nevertheless, I \nwant to commend him in particular for his involvement in these talks \nand his commitment to achieving a fair resolution of this issue. Since \nJanuary, there has been little discernible progress in addressing the \nlaunch aid issue, which directly affects Boeing, Airbus's main \ncompetitor in the civil aircraft market.\n  The Senate, in passing this resolution today, is stating very clearly \nthat EU subsidies to Airbus must end and that launch aid must be \nrejected in order to avoid WTO action by the U.S. I am encouraged by \nthe comments of EU Trade Commissioner Mandelson in favor of extending \nthe negotiation period that expires today to give both sides more time \nto reach a fair deal. However, additional discussions will only be \nproductive if Commissioner Mandelson recommits to the framework agreed \nto 90 days ago. If the EU continues to flout the January agreement, WTO \naction may be unavoidable.\n  In addition, in my view, if the EU were to provide any new launch aid \nsupport for the A350, the U.S. would have no choice but to immediately \nrequest a WTO panel. This would be the largest trade dispute in the \nhistory of the WTO. I hope we do not have to go that route. It would be \nmuch better if both sides would come back to the table and restart \nsubstantive negotiations with the goal of reaching a bilateral \nagreement. American companies can compete with anyone in the world, but \nnot on an uneven playing field. Airbus is a mature, profitable company \nthat should compete on commercial terms without government subsidies. \nThis resolution today says that we believe the playing field must be \nleveled for all competitors in the commercial aircraft market.\n\n\n                       fourth ``resolved'' clause\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would ask the majority leader, who \nsponsored this concurrent resolution, to clarify his intended meaning \nof the fourth ``Resolved'' clause on page four of the resolution. I am \nspecifically interested in the intention of the use of the terms ``any \nadditional action'' and ``large commercial aircraft market.'' I ask \nbecause the aerospace industry is an integrated and global industry. In \nmost every instance, aerospace companies are vertically integrated to \nsome degree and they are engaged in many other related activities. In \nmany instances, they are component manufacturers, as well as platform \nmanufacturers. Would it be correct to understand that the majority \nleader does not intend that this clause target these other business \nactivities that are not directly associated with the marketing and sale \nof large fixed-wing aircraft to commercial carriers in the passenger \ntransportation market?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his question. The \nphrases ``any additional action'' and ``large commercial aircraft \nmarket'' are solely intended to address those activities associated \nwith business activities regarding the marketing and sale of large \nfixed-wing aircraft to commercial carriers in the passenger \ntransportation market. They are not intended to address business \nactivities of any specific company at the secondary or tertiary \nsupplier level. Nor are they intended to address other business \nactivities of any specific company engaged in other platform-related \nactivities.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his \nresponse. Additionally, I understand that it is not the purpose of this \nresolution, and more specifically of the fourth ``Resolved'' clause, to \nsuggest punitive action be taken against any company's activities \nrelated to products sold to U.S. Government agencies, such as the \nDepartment of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, or the U.S. \nCoast Guard, whether those products are radars, components of radars, \nor helicopters. Is this understanding correct?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I agree with the understanding of the \nSenator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his \nclarification of the resolution and its intent. I would encourage all \nof my colleagues to consider with care the possibility of unintended \nconsequences. The complexity of this industry is such that my State and \nalmost every State has numerous business and economic interests that \ncould be negatively impacted if we are not careful about how we respond \nto a legitimate concern.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for \nyielding to my colleague, Senator Murray, and me. We are going to speak \nabout the resolution that the Senate passed, and passed with large \nsupport from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, which we are \nvery happy to see. The issue of a level playing field for a competitive \naerospace market is something that is critically important to the \nAmerican people and to the workforce of America. I thank our leaders, \nSenators Frist and Reid, and Senator Baucus for bringing this \nresolution to the Senate floor today and for moving this through the \nprocess so that we can send a message from the Senate about how \nimportant we think it is to have a competitive aerospace market.\n  My colleague has been following this issue for years and is going to \nlay out some of the issues that we in the United States have been \ntrying to elevate to the point of awareness so we can establish a \ncompetitive marketplace. The bottom line is, negotiations that were \nbegun in January of this year between the United States and the \nEuropean Union to discuss how to battle the competitive aerospace \nmarket today that doesn't unfairly have government backing and \nsubsidization of major aerospace manufacturers, those negotiations have \nbroken down. Now we are at a point where the issues to be resolved, \nspecifically launch aid and the financing of the production of a new \nA350 plane by the European Union, are something it is important to \naddress quickly.\n  The reason I say that is because we know when you have the financial \nbacking of a government juxtaposed to the financial backing of the \nprivate sector, in the United States, when Boeing builds a plane, it \ngoes out and finances that with the backing of the capital markets, of \nWall Street, of the private banking institutions, and they have to \nprove that plane is a success. They don't get any forgiveness on the \nloan. They don't get any special rate. They don't get any discounts if \nthe plane is not a success. When they go to the capital markets, they \nhave to prove the success of the marketplace.\n\n  I can tell you now that success is happening with the 787 plane, the \nnewest product that Boeing launched a year ago and is out there in the \nmarketplace selling today. But they are competing against a plane that \nis being or has the potential to be financed by the European Union. So \nif you think about the A350 getting launch aid, or potentially getting \nlaunch aid from the European Union, it doesn't matter whether the plane \nis a success. It doesn't matter how many planes are sold. They have a \nspecial arrangement so that in the backing of the financing of that \nplane, the European Union becomes the deep pocket.\n  What does that mean to consumers who are buying these planes and what \ndoes it mean to the workforce? It means simply this: The Americans have \na disadvantage when selling Boeing planes around the globe because they \nhave to meet the competitive markets of private financing while the \nEuropeans--it doesn't matter whether their plane is a success--get the \nbacking of the European Union. The whole global economy is based on a \nfair and competitive marketplace in which we are going to drive down \ncosts to consumers--the airlines, in this particular case--and we are \ngoing to let the best airplane win in the marketplace because they have \ndesigned a product that the workforce, the consumers, the aviation \nindustry wants to see.\n  We don't want government making those decisions. We want the private \nsector making the decisions. That is why I am so glad the \nadministration has taken an aggressive approach on this issue and has \npushed for the discussions that are now ending. The administration, \nthrough the USTR office in the White House, has said if the European \nUnion continues to use new launch aid subsidies for the A350 plane, \nthen, yes, we are going to go to the World Trade Organization and file \na complaint. That is an appropriate action by this administration.\n  What would be better is if the Europeans would sit down at the table \nand come back to this discussion that should have been part of the 1992 \ndiscussion on how to have a competitive aerospace industry. But that \ndidn't happen. So now in January of this year, the two sides, the \nEuropean Union and the United States, sat down at a table and said they \nwere going to negotiate in good faith. Part of that negotiation was to \nhave the parties at the table make no new government support agreements \nduring the time of the negotiations. Yet that is exactly what Airbus is \nnow coming in to talk about--subsidies and launch aid for the A350.\n  It is important that this body send the message it sent today, that \nwe are going to be behind the administration, behind USTR, behind the \nWhite House in making sure a fair and competitive aerospace market \ntakes place, that we are not going to sit by and see one manufacturer \nmake a great product that has basically taken off in the marketplace, \ngetting sales, getting people to buy the plane because they built it \nthe old-fashioned way. They had an idea. They had the right feature \nset. They had the right product. They had the right design and \ncustomers are buying that. Yet they may have to compete against \nsomebody who has the deep financial backing of a government that \ndoesn't care whether it is the right feature set or the right product.\n  So we in the United States care greatly about the competitiveness of \nthis marketplace. We have lots of jobs in aerospace, and we certainly, \nin Washington State, have benefited from that and so have many of my \nother colleagues in the Senate because there are probably aerospace \nmanufacturing jobs all over the country.\n  But the point is that we have to have a competitive marketplace, not \njust in aerospace but in other areas. The sooner we get back to the \ntable and address the issue of how unfair launch aid is as a concept, \nthe sooner we can get to a competitive marketplace. And the sooner we \ncan get a fair and competitive marketplace, the sooner the consumers \nwill win and the United States will continue to have a level playing \nfield in which our workforce, which is producing a great product that \nis winning in the marketplace, will continue to win based on the \nsuccess of their results and not be basically disadvantaged because of \nan unlevel playing field.\n  So I am glad to be here with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto speak enthusiastically about the resolution we just passed. I hope \nit will be noticed by the European Union that we are united--Democrats \nand Republicans--in getting this issue addressed and that a competitive \naerospace market that is driven by private investment backing is the \nbest way to go for us, not just as a nation but for true global \ncompetition.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise this evening, as well, to join my \ncolleague in support of the fair aerospace competition resolution that \npassed this body 96 to 0.\n  Thousands of American aerospace workers have lost their jobs in the \npast decade. That trend is going to continue unless we take action.\n  This evening I especially thank leaders on both sides of the aisle--\nSenator Frist and Senator Reid--for their help and support of this \nmeasure. Senators Grassley and Baucus of the Finance Committee have \nbeen of great help. And, as always, I am proud to serve with Senator \nMaria Cantwell, my colleague from Washington State and another strong \nadvocate for America's aerospace workers.\n  Our country invented the aerospace industry 100 years ago. Through \nit, American workers have done more than feed their families and pay \nfor mortgages; they have made air travel safer and brought economic \ngrowth and innovation to every corner of our economy.\n  Many in this body have heard me talk for years about Europe's efforts \nto distort the commercial aerospace industry. In short, Airbus has done \neverything it can to kill our aerospace industry. Airbus has received \nbillions in illegal launch aid. Airbus has tried\n\n[[Page S3404]]\n\nto play tricks on this side of the ocean with their slick PR campaign. \nAnd Airbus will continue the unfair tactics until they completely \ndominate the global aerospace market.\n  While Airbus is doing all of these things to hurt American workers, \nit is actually trying to get us to think they are a friend to the very \nmen and women they are putting out of work.\n  Unfortunately, EADS, Airbus, and European governments will do and say \nanything to dominate the global aerospace market. I am here today to \ncall their bluff and show this body, once again, that Airbus is no \nfriend of the United States or our workers and to ensure that their \ndoubletalk is exposed for all to see.\n  I have worked closely with several U.S. Trade Representatives on this \nissue over the years. For the past several months, the United States \nhas tried to negotiate with the Europeans, but it is very clear that \nthe Europeans do not take our concerns seriously. Those discussions \nappear to have broken down, and the Europeans are threatening a radical \nescalation if we pursue our right to file a WTO case.\n  You would think after all Airbus has done to kill American jobs, they \nwould at least make a good-faith effort now that we are finally calling \nthem to account for their behavior. But the Airbus and European leaders \nhave done just the opposite. They have pounded their chest about how \ntheir latest subsidized plane will dominate the industry.\n  Instead of coming clean--or at least stopping their trade-distorting \nbehavior--Airbus has sought to influence public opinion. They have \npursued a deceptive public relations campaign. They have taken out ads \nin the Capitol Hill publications and major newspapers around the \ncountry, just like the one behind me.\n  Airbus claims to be a good friend of American workers, but it is \nselling to America's sworn enemies. Airbus claims to support hundreds \nof thousands of American jobs, but they cannot document them. Airbus \nclaims it wants to be a more American company, but then it turns and \npreaches European domination when they think we are not looking.\n\n  We need to stand up for this unfair competition and send a strong \nsignal to the Europeans that this Congress and this country will not \nallow a European-subsidized company to destroy America's aerospace \nindustry.\n  They can talk out of both sides of their mouth all they want, but I \nam here to lay the facts on the table and to stand up for our workers.\n  Mr. President, I applaud the Bush administration, and specifically \nAmbassador Robert Zoellick, for the work they are doing to end unfair \ntrade practices in the aerospace industry. This administration entered \ninto negotiations in good faith. They wanted to restore balance and \nfairness to the commercial aircraft trade.\n  Unfortunately, Europe has never taken these talks or this issue \nseriously. Our willingness to seek a negotiated settlement has been \ngreeted by more arrogant entitlement from Airbus and its European \nbackers. While publicly committing to negotiations, Airbus and European \nleaders have been working behind the scenes to continue subsidies to \nAirbus in spite of U.S. threats to file a WTO case.\n  Now European Commission Ambassador John Bruton is saying, `` . . . \none result of a case would be that maximum aid would be given'' for \nAirbus's new A350.\n  Today, this campaign is more directly than ever in Congress's line of \nsight. I hope to clearly show Airbus is not an American company and \nAirbus is simply continuing its policy of saying and doing anything to \nget what it wants.\n  A week ago last Friday, European Union Trade Commissioner Peter \nMandelson wrote an eye-popping piece in the Washington Post. He, once \nagain, restated baseless accusations against Boeing in an effort to \njustify billions of dollars in illegal Airbus launch aid.\n  The issue Mandelson correctly identifies as central to American \nconcerns is the massive subsidies in the form of launch aid, landing \nrights, and other giveaways that European governments give to Airbus. \nNow the Europeans would like you to think that we offer similar \nsubsidies to Boeing, but the facts simply don't line up. I don't need \nto talk at great length about the subsidies tonight, but I think it is \nworthwhile to make you all understand what those subsidies actually do.\n  European governments give Airbus huge direct subsidies to build new \nairplanes. These subsidies take the form of launch aid, supplier \nsubsidies, R subsidies, and facilities subsidies. These subsidies \ncreate an uneven playing field and allow Airbus to do what normal, \nprivate companies cannot afford to do. They develop new products \nwithout any risk.\n  One American company is playing by traditional business norms--\nborrowing money at commercial rates, being responsible to shareholders, \nand knowing if they don't make a profit, they are in trouble. That is \nwhy Boeing ``bets the company'' when they develop a new plane. Airbus \nenjoys virtually a risk-free product development, and it operates far \noutside of the bounds of fair competition. All of this comes at the \nexpense of U.S. companies and American workers.\n  What does that mean in real terms? Let's take the new superjumbo \nAirbus A380 as an example. According to a January 20 article in the \nFinancial Post, titled ``The Airbus 380,'' A380 subsidies are \nofficially at $4.3 billion. Other estimates put it at over $6 billion.\n  The same day, the independent newspaper said:\n\n       To break even on its own investment, Airbus needs to sell \n     250 of the A380. To repay the four governments it needs to \n     shift to 700. To count as a real commercial success, Airbus \n     needs to sell twice that number. So far, it has firm orders \n     for 149.\n\n  It is no wonder that last summer respected industrial analyst Richard \nAboulafia of the Teal Group called the plane a ``bloated airborne \nwelfare queen.''\n  No other company in the world would be able to handle such huge cost \noverruns. But Airbus can because if the plane fails, they will simply \nwrite off the costs and move on to the next one.\n  To make matters worse, they have been making outlandish claims in \nthis country for years. First, they claim Airbus has created and \nsupports 120,000 jobs in this country. The Commerce Department can only \ndocument 500. Airbus says it subcontracts with as many as 800 firms in \nthe United States, though they have moved that number up and down over \nthe years. The Commerce Department can only come up with 250.\n  This last week, our Commerce Department released an exhaustive study \ndone at the request of this Congress on the U.S. jet transport \nindustry. That 150-page report once again comes to the same conclusion \nwe have heard time and time again. Airbus is not an American company, \nand Airbus does almost nothing to support the hundreds of thousands of \nAmerican workers who depend on this important industry.\n  Airbus and EADS are not helping America's aerospace industry; they \nare destroying it. In 15 years, 700,000 American workers have lost \ntheir jobs while Europe keeps adding new workers to the EADS and Airbus \npayroll. That is simply unacceptable.\n  Looking at their claims in American press alone, Airbus appears to be \na pseudo-American company looking to create more jobs and helping to \ngrow our economy. That is not the real story. Take a look at what \nAirbus proprietors say in Europe when they think we are not looking. A \nfew months ago, with a lot of pomp and circumstance, the latest \nEuropean Airbus product, the A380, was unveiled with four heads of \nstate. Their comments show Europe's true intentions.\n  From the Spanish Prime Minister, Jose Luis Rodriquez Zapetero:\n\n       The European Union has built the plane that is the standard \n     bearer for European and global aeronautics.\n\n  He went on to boast:\n\n       What we see here today is Europe cannot be stopped.\n\n  He is saying that Europe, not a company, cannot be stopped.\n  From the French President, Jacques Chirac:\n\n       It is a technological feat and a great European success. \n     When it takes to the skies, it will carry the colors of our \n     continent, and our technological ambitions to even greater \n     heights.\n\n  From the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair:\n\n       It is European cooperation at its best. Airbus demonstrates \n     that we can achieve more together in Europe than we ever can \n     alone.\n\n\n[[Page S3405]]\n\n\n  Finally, the German Chancellor, when asked about subsidies to Airbus, \nsaid:\n\n       We have done that in the past, we are doing it now, and we \n     will do so in the future.\n\n  This does not sound like a company bent on doing anything for \nAmerican workers, but, again, that is what Airbus and its supporters \nare saying and doing to get what they want.\n  Unfortunately, the examples only continue. I do not have to look any \nfurther than the NBC Nightly News to find another shocking attack on \nAmerican values and workers. For years, Airbus told us they will do \nanything to get a deal, and apparently they will sell to anyone. Not \nlong ago, NBC News uncovered direct evidence of Airbus efforts to sell \nmilitary aircraft to a country focused on destabilizing and undermining \nAmerican interests in the Middle East, a country that is currently in \nthe pursuit of nuclear weapons, a country to which no real American \ncompany would dare sell weapons.\n  NBC News was able to get a camera crew into an airshow in Kish, Iran, \nand they found EADS pitching their military helicopters to Iran.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full transcript of the NBC story be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  European Firms Display Wares in Iran\n\n              [By Lisa Myers & the NBC Investigative Unit]\n\n       Kish, Iran.--As President Bush pressures European allies to \n     get tougher with Iran, NBC News got a rare glimpse inside the \n     country--at an Iranian air show attended by some of the \n     world's leading military contractors eager to do business \n     with America's adversary.\n       On the island of Kish, mullahs mixed with Ukrainian \n     generals amid photos of the Ayatollah Khomeini. Iran's \n     contempt for the United States was clear--emblazoned \n     underneath a helicopter, in Farsi: ``Death to America.''\n       It's generally illegal for American companies to do \n     business with Iran. But NBC News found more than a dozen \n     European defense and aviation firms eager to fill the void. \n     Some do business with the Pentagon, yet they were actively \n     selling their wares to Iran.\n       ``We sell to Iran [sic] Air Force,'' said Francois Leloup \n     from Aerazur, a French company that markets fighter pilot \n     vests, anti-gravity suits and other protective gear for \n     military pilots.\n       ``We sell mainly to security people like police,'' said \n     Arnaud Chevalier with Auxiliaire Technique, which was \n     representing a group of companies at its exhibition booth. \n     Some of the brochures on dispay showed tank helmets, \n     communication systems for light armored vehicles and an \n     ``infantry headset.'' Chevalier said such equipment was ``not \n     for sale.''\n       NBC News showed our video from the air show to arms expert \n     John Pike, director of the nonprofit organization \n     GlobalSecurity.org.\n       ``I think that the Europeans would sell their grandmothers \n     to the Iranians if they thought they could make a buck,'' \n     says Pike.\n       Also exhibiting at the show--European Aeronautic Defence \n     and Space Company (EADS) and its subsidiary Eurocopter--which \n     has launched a campaign in the United States to get a bigger \n     share of Pentagon contracts, featuring ads that wrap the \n     company in the American flag.\n       But if the company is so pro-American, why is it ignoring \n     U.S. policy to isolate Iran?\n       ``As a European company, we're not supposed to take into \n     account embargoes from the U.S.,'' says Michel Tripier, with \n     EADS.\n       ``The emphasis here is on our civil helicopters. We are not \n     offering military helicopters here,'' he adds.\n       Yet, prominent on the company's video in Iran--a military \n     helicopter.\n       ``It says `Navy' in their own promotional videotape,'' says \n     John Pike. ``I guess they're hoping Iran's navy is going to \n     want to buy it.''\n       EADS says the helicopter just happened to be on the video, \n     and that it abides by U.S. and European rules against selling \n     military goods to Iran.\n       Another company, Finmeccanica, recently won a contract to \n     build a new version of the presidential helicopter, Marine \n     One, as part of a group led by U.S. contractor Lockheed \n     Martin.\n       It was also in Kish showing off its helicopters to Iran.\n       ``This company is building the American president's new \n     helicopter, and they're trying to trade with the enemy!'' \n     exclaims Pike.\n       Steven Bryen used to be the Pentagon official responsible \n     for preventing technology from going to countries like Iran. \n     Now he's the president of Finmeccanica in the United States. \n     Does he think Iran is an enemy of the United States? .\n       ``I think they're our enemy at this point,'' says Bryen. \n     ``I mean, they're behaving like our enemy.''\n       So why would Bryen's company trade with an enemy?\n       ``In Europe, they don't call it the enemy,'' he says. ``If \n     it's a civilian item that doesn't threaten anyone, then I \n     don't have a problem with that.''\n       European subsidiaries of NBC's parent company, General \n     Electric, have sold energy and power equipment to Iran, but \n     GE recently announced it will make no new sales. (MSNBC is a \n     Microsoft-NBC joint venture.)\n       Still, even with the president now pushing hard to isolate \n     Tehran, European allies are likely to continue their role as \n     what one company called, ``a reliable partner for Iran.''\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I will read just a bit from that piece:\n\n       Also exhibiting at the show, European Aeronautic Defence \n     and Space Company, EADS, and its subsidiary Eurocopter, which \n     has launched a campaign in the United States to get a bigger \n     share of Pentagon contracts, featuring ads that wrap the \n     company in American flag.\n       But if the company is so pro-American, why is it ignoring \n     U.S. policy to isolate Iran.\n       As a European company, we are not supposed to take into \n     account embargoes from the U.S., says Michael Tripler, with \n     EADS.\n\n  Michael Tripler, from EADS, once again, saying and doing anything \nanywhere to advance the European interests of a European company. \nAirbus and EADS clearly sing one tune in newspapers in the United \nStates, another at media events in France, and quite a different one \nwhile selling their products in Iran.\n  Taken together, the goal is clear: EADS and Airbus do not intend to \nstop until they have gobbled up the entire aerospace market.\n  So what is next for Airbus? Any question of their intentions was \nanswered as we tried to work out an amicable solution to the dispute \nthis past January. On a day that could have been a turning point in the \nprocess, Airbus CEO Noel Forgeard said he would seek new launch aid \nfrom European nations for the Airbus A350.\n  While in one breath Airbus says it does not need launch aid to build \nthe A350, they have nevertheless applied for, and European governments \nare prepared to provide, $1.7 billion in new launch aid.\n  To once again paraphrase German Chancellor Schroeder: They have done \nthat in the past, they are doing it now, and they will do so in the \nfuture.\n  But again, no need to take my word alone on the illegality of the \nlaunch aid or their central role in the ongoing dispute. The Financial \nTimes, a European newspaper, called the plan to subsidize the A350 and \nForgeard's announcement unwise and deeply unhelpful, and went on to \nsay:\n\n       Launch aid, Airbus' unique subsidy, is an especially \n     blatant violation of the principles of fair competition. The \n     EU should let it go. State support for private companies, \n     even those with long lead times and big development costs, \n     becomes indefensible as they mature. Infant industries must \n     grow up.\n\n  In a Business Week commentary from the same week, Stanley Holmes \nwrites:\n\n       The U.S. should call the Europeans' bluff. Let the facts \n     speak for themselves, and resolve this dispute at the WTO.\n\n  Months ago, I made the same suggestion, and although there appeared \nto be hope of avoiding that fate within the past few weeks, I now \nbelieve we must work through the WTO and hold our line.\n  With the Europeans bent on keeping their subsidies, it is time to \ntake bold action to protect our workers and send a strong message to \nEurope that enough is enough. Europe has to understand that continued \nattempts to undermine our aerospace industry and its workers will not \nstand.\n  The need to restore a competitive balance to the aerospace industry \nis not going away. Thousands of American jobs have been lost in the \nlast decade, and thousands more are at risk due to continued direct \nsubsidies to Airbus.\n  I will continue to work closely with the USTR and with the Bush \nadministration to protect American jobs and ensure the future strength \nof the American aerospace industry. Whether through the continuation of \nthese negotiations or through a trade case at the WTO, a competitive \nbalance has to be restored. We in Congress have to show the Europeans \nthat we are serious about this action.\n  I thank my colleagues for supporting the resolution that was just \nadopted by the Senate 96 to 0. I will continue to be a voice for \nAmerican workers. Again, I thank the Bush administration, Senator \nFrist, and Senator Reid for helping us with the resolution.\n\n[[Page S3406]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield for a comment before yielding the \nfloor?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I have been listening intently, and I applaud the Senator \nfor all she has done. It is reminiscent that this is not something new. \nBack when I was serving in the other body in the late 1980s, \nCongressman Jim Oberstar and I actually made a trip to Europe--that was \nbefore the European Union days--both to Germany and France to find out \nthe level of subsidy they had. At that time, we were not able to find \nout, and we did an exhaustive search. They were denying that they did, \nand later on they admitted they were subsidizing. With their type of \naccounting, perhaps it is even worse than the figures the Senator is \nexpressing today. So I applaud the Senator for her efforts.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator, and I look forward to working with \nhim to fight for our aerospace industry and to make sure companies in \nthis country have a fair playing field.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/11/senate-section/article/S3406-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3406-S3407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CHINA'S SPREADING GLOBAL INFLUENCE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise for a second time in 8 days to \nupdate all of us on an issue of deepest importance. In my recent speech \non China I delivered this past Monday, I detailed how China is indeed a \ngrowing threat. When the fragmented pieces of current events and \npolicies are glued together, they form an alarming picture of the \nthreat to our national security. I believe this threat is of the most \nserious order, and until we address it I will continue to draw \nAmerica's attention to it.\n  In 2000, Congress established the U.S.-China Security Economic Review \nCommission to act as the bipartisan authority on how our relationship \nwith China affects our economy, industrial base, China's military and \nweapons proliferation, and our influence in Asia. I fear that the \nCommission's findings have largely been ignored.\n  A major part of our economic relationship with China is the growing \ntrade deficit. This deficit grew to $162 billion in 2004, by far the \nlargest economic imbalance the United States has with any country. One \npotential key factor contributing to this imbalance is the \nundervaluation of the Chinese yaun. Through currency manipulation, \nChina has been able to create an uneven economic playing field in its \nfavor. Let's keep in mind this bipartisan commission worked on this for \nseveral years. The Commission recommends that Congress pursue \nlegislation that will push the administration toward correcting these \nimbalances and for the U.S. Trade Representative and Department of \nCommerce to undertake an investigation of China's questionable economic \npractices. I think this is very sound advice. In fact, I voted last \nWednesday to not table a Chinese currency manipulation amendment.\n  China joined the World Trade Organization in December 2001. Their \ntransition was to be overseen by the Transitional View Mechanism--TRM. \nAlthough China has made some progress in the areas of tariffs and other \nWTO commitments, they have consistently frustrated the TRM's ability to \nassess China's WTO compliance through lack of transparency. As the \nCommission recommends, the Bush administration must be encouraged to \ntake action to preserve TRM's oversight and cooperate with other \ntrading partners to create a cooperative effort to address China's \nshortfalls.\n  Another problem area is that the Chinese Government has been listing \nState Owned Enterprises--SOEs--on international capital markets. These \ncompanies lack accountability standards that normally track the \ncompanies' cash flow. At least one Chinese SOE, China North Industries \nCorporation, has been sanctioned by the U.S. Government for \nproliferating illegal weapons technology. As the 2004 Commission report \noutlines:\n\n       Without adequate information about Chinese firms trading in \n     international capital markets, U.S. investors may be \n     unwittingly pouring money into black box firms lacking basic \n     corporate governance structures, as well as enterprises \n     involved in activities harmful to U.S. security interests.\n\n  Beyond dangerous investing, there are other security aspects to \nChina's trade practices. The hard currency that China is gaining \nthrough its manipulative economy is buying foreign technology and \nmodernizing their military. We used to be concerned about their nuclear \ncapability, but now it is also conventional weaponry, as the Presiding \nOfficer knows, since he sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee. We \nknow China is pushing very hard to get the E.U. to remove their arms \nembargo. The embargo was put in place after the 1989 Tiananmen Square \nmassacre to protest China's appalling human rights record. The E.U. \nc1aims that the embargo is no longer effective, but ignores the \nobvious--why lift the embargo without replacing it with a better one? \nTheir solution, an informal ``code of conduct'', allows for no \ncomprehensive enforcement. We can also expect E.U. technology to \nproliferate beyond China's borders, to countries that would gladly use \nit against the U.S. The E.U. does not consider this a strategic threat. \nIn fact, President Chirac just demanded an early lifting of the \nembargo. However, the Commission reports:\n\n       Access to more advanced systems and integrating \n     technologies from Europe would have a much more dramatic \n     impact on overall Chinese capabilities today than say five or \n     ten years ago. For fourteen years China has been unable to \n     acquire systems from the West. Analysts believe a resumption \n     of EU arms sales to China would dramatically enhance China's \n     military capability. If the EU arms embargo against China is \n     lifted, the U.S. military could be placed in a situation \n     where it is defending itself against arms sold to the PLA by \n     NATO allies.\n\n  Think about this: we share military technology with our European \nallies and then find our security threatened and possibly our \nservicemen killed by this same technology. All this is made possible \nbecause China is exploiting economic grey areas to come up with the \nmoney to buy all this new technology. This is a critical issue to which \nCongress must respond to.\n  Further, some experts believe that China's economic policy is a \npurposeful attempt to undermine the U.S. industrial base and likewise, \nthe defense industrial base. Perhaps it is hard to believe that China's \neconomic manipulation is such a threat to our Nation. In response, I \nwould like to read from the book Unrestricted Warfare, written by two \nPLA--People's Liberation Army--senior colonels:\n\n       Military threats are already no longer the major factors \n     affecting national security . . . traditional factors are \n     increasingly becoming more intertwined with grabbing \n     resources, contending for markets, controlling capital, trade \n     sanctions and other economic factors . . . the destruction \n     which they do in the areas attacked are absolutely not \n     secondary to pure military wars.\n\n  The book goes on to argue that the aggressor must ``adjust its own \nfinancial strategy'' and ``use currency revaluation'' to weaken the \neconomic base and the military strength of the other country. This is \nthe Chinese saying this, not some American commentator. You need to \nhear that in context of the U.S.-China Commission's statement:\n\n       One of Beijing's stated goals is to reduce what it \n     considers U.S. superpower dominance in favor of a multipolar \n     global power structure in which China attains superpower \n     status on par with the United States.\n\n  I think the picture is clear. We must link China's trading privileges \nto its economic practices. As China's No. 1 importing customer, \naccounting for 35 percent of total Chinese exports, we have the \ninfluence. As I said last Monday, a week ago, I agree that the way we \nhandle an emerging China must be dynamic, but it must not be weak. The \nCommission puts it well:\n\n       We need to use our substantial leverage to develop an \n     architecture that will help avoid conflict, attempt to build \n     cooperative practices and institutions, and advance both \n     countries' long-term interests. The United States has the \n     leverage now and perhaps for the next decade, but this may \n     not always be the case. We also must recognize the impact of \n     these trends directly on the domestic U.S. economy, and \n     develop and adopt policies that ensure that our actions do \n     not undermine our economic interests . . . the United States \n     cannot lose sight of these important goals, and must \n     configure its policies toward China to help make them \n     materialize . . . If we falter in the use of our economic and \n     political influence now to effect positive change in China, \n     we will have squandered an historic opportunity.\n\n  The bipartisan U.S.-China Commission has been doing an outstanding \njob in translating how recent events affect\n\n[[Page S3407]]\n\nour national security. I plan on giving two more speeches highlighting \nthe Commission's findings, followed by a resolution to effect their \nconclusions. I hope America is listening.\n  It is so similar to what we are facing right now and what we voted \non, the fact that the European Union is subsidizing a company which \nwould undermine the aerospace industry here in the United States. At \nthe same time, if the European Union lifts the sanctions which they \nhave right now, they would be doing essentially the same thing to our \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/11/senate-section/article/S3407-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. CRAPO.

Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my \ndistinguished colleagues, in proposing The Preservation of Antibiotics \nfor Human Treatment Act of 2005. Our goal in this important initiative \nis to take needed action to preserve the effectiveness of antibiotics \nin treating diseases.\n  These drugs are truly a modem medical miracle. During World War II, \nthe newly developed ``wonder drug'' penicillin revolutionized the care \nfor our soldiers wounded in battle. Since then, they have become \nindispensable in modem medicine, protecting all of us from deadly \ninfections. They are even more valuable today, safeguarding the nation \nfrom the threat of bioterrorism. Unfortunately, over the past years, we \nhave done too little to prevent the emergence of antibiotic-resistant \nstrains of bacteria and other germs, and many of our most powerful \ndrugs are no longer effective.\n  Partly, the resistance is the result of the overprescribing of such \ndrugs in routine medical care. But, mounting evidence also shows at the \nindiscriminate use of critical drugs in animal feed is also a major \nfactor in the development of antibiotic resistant germs.\n  Obviously, if animals are sick, whether as pets or livestock, they \nshould be treated with the best veterinary medications available. That \nis not a problem. The problem is the widespread practice of using \nantibiotics to promote growth and fatten healthy livestock. This \nnontherapeutic use clearly undermines the effectiveness of these \nimportant drugs because it leads to greater development of antibiotic-\nresistant bacteria that can make infections in humans difficult or \nimpossible to treat.\n  In 1998--7 years ago--a report prepared at the request of the \nDepartment of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration, by the \nNational Academy of Sciences, concluded ``there is a link between the \nuse of antibiotics in food animals, the development of bacterial \nresistance to these drugs, and human disease.'' The World Health \nOrganization has specifically recommended that antibiotics used to \ntreat humans should not be used to promote animal growth, although they \ncould still be used to treat sick animals.\n  In 2001, Federal interagency task force on antibiotic resistance \nconcluded that ``drug-resistant pathogens are a growing menace to all \npeople, regardless of age, gender, or socio-economic background. If we \ndo not act to address the problem . . . [d]rug choices for the \ntreatment of common infections will become increasingly limited and \nexpensive-and, in some cases, nonexistent.''\n  The Union of Concerned Scientists estimates that 70 percent of all \nU.S. antibiotics are used nontherapeutically in animal agriculture--\neight times more than in are used in all of human medicine. This \nindiscriminate use clearly reduces their potency.\n  Major medical associations have been increasingly concerned and taken \nstrong stands against antibiotic use in animal agriculture. In June \n2001, the American Medical Association adopted a resolution opposing \nnontherapeutic use of antibiotics in animals. Other professional \nmedical organizations that have taken a similar stands include the \nAmerican College of Preventive Medicine, the American Public Health \nAssociation, and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists. \nThe legislation we are offering has been strongly endorsed by the \nAmerican Public Health Association and numerous other groups and \nindependent experts in the field.\n  Ending this detrimental practice is feasible and cost-effective. In \nfact, most of the developed countries in the world, except for the \nUnited States and Canada, already restrict the use of antibiotics to \npromote growth in raising livestock. In 1999, the European Union banned \nsuch use and money saved on drugs has been invested in improving \nhygiene and animal husbandry practices. Researchers in Denmark found a \ndramatic decline in the number of drug-resistant organisms in animals--\nand no significant increase in animal diseases or in consumer prices.\n  These results have encouraged clinicians and researchers to call for \na similar ban in the United States. The title of an editorial in the \nNew England Journal of Medicine 4 years ago said it all: \n``Antimicrobial Use in Animal Feed--Time to Stop.''\n  On Thursday, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Public \nHealth Association, Environmental Defense, the Food Animal Concerns \nTrust, and the Union of Concerned Scientists joined together in filing \na formal petition with FDA calling for the withdrawal of certain \nclasses of drugs from animal feed.\n  Earlier last week, Acting FDA Commissioner Lester Crawford emphasized \nhis own concern that the use of such drugs in food-producing animals \nhas an adverse health impact on humans. He stated that the FDA agrees \nwith the GAO recommendation to review approved animal drugs that are \ncritical to human health, and described FDA's progress in doing so. He \nstated, however, that the review process is extremely slow and labor \nintensive, and that even when safety issues are identified, the FDA can \ndo little more than hope that the animal pharmaceutical companies will \ncooperate in addressing the issue.\n  There is no question that the Nation stands at risk of an epidemic \noutbreak of food poisoning caused by drug-resistant bacteria or other \ngerms. It is time to put public safety first and stop the abuse of \ndrugs critical to human health.\n  The bill we propose will phase out the nontherapeutic use in \nlivestock of medically important antibiotics, unless manufacturers can \nshow such use is no danger to public health. The act requires applying \nthis same strict standard to applications for approval of new animal \nantibiotics. Treatment is not restricted if the animals are sick or are \npets or other animals not used for food. In addition, FDA is given the \nauthority to restrict the use of important drugs in animals, if the \nrisk to humans is in question.\n  According to the National Academy of Sciences, eliminating the use of \nantibiotics as feed additives in agriculture would cost each American \nconsumer not more than five to ten dollars a year. The legislation \nrecognizes, however, economic costs to farmers in making the transition \nto antibiotic-free practices may be substantial. In such cases, the Act \nprovides for federal payments to defray the cost of shifting to \nantibiotic-free practices, with preference for family farms.\n  Antibiotics are among the greatest miracles of modern medicine, yet \nwe are destroying them faster than the pharmaceutical industry can \ncreate replacements. If doctors lose these critical remedies, the most \nvulnerable among us will suffer the most--children, the elderly, \npersons with HIV/AIDS, who are most in danger of resistant infections. \nI urge my colleagues to support this clearly needed legislation to \nprotect the health of all Americans from this reckless and unjustified \nuse of antibiotics.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today we are facing a public health crisis \nwhich most of us certainly did not anticipate. Nearly a half century \nago, following the development of modern antibiotics, Nobel Laureate \nSir McFarland Burnet stated, ``One can think of the middle of the \ntwentieth century as the end of one of the most important social \nrevolutions in history, the virtual elimination of infectious diseases \nas a significant factor in social life.''\n  How things have changed. Today some of our most deadly health threats\n\n[[Page S3408]]\n\ncome from infectious diseases. When we consider the greatest killers--\nHIV, tuberculosis, malaria--it is clear that infectious diseases have \nnot abated. At the same time we have seen an alarming trend--\nincreasingly physicians are stymied as existing antibiotics are \nbecoming less effective in treating infections. We know that resistance \nto drugs can be developed, and that the more we expose bacteria to \nantibiotics, the more resistance we will see. So it is crucial that we \npreserve antibiotics for use in treating disease.\n  Most Americans appreciate this fact, and now understand that colds \nand flu are caused by viruses. So we know that treating a cold with an \nantibiotic is inappropriate, and we understand that such use of \nantibiotics is unwise. Over 9 out of 10 Americans now know that \nresistance to antibiotics is growing. Our health care providers are \ngetting the message too. Physicians know that when a patient who has \nbeen inappropriately prescribed an antibiotic actually develops a \nbacterial infection, it is more likely to be resistant to treatment.\n  When we overuse antibiotics, we risk eliminating the very cures which \nscientists fought so hard to develop. The threat of bioterrorism \namplifies the danger. I have supported increased NIH research funding, \nas well as Bioshield legislation, in order to promote development of \nessential drugs. Yet as we work hard to develop lifesaving medications, \ntheir misuse will render them ineffective.\n  Every day in America antibiotics continue to be used in huge \nquantities for no treatment purpose whatsoever. I am speaking of the \nnon-therapeutic use of antibiotics in agriculture. Simply put, the \npractice of feeding antibiotics to healthy animals jeopardizes the \neffectiveness of these medicines in treating ill people and animals.\n  Recognizing the public health threat caused by antibiotic resistance, \nCongress in 2000 amended the Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act \nto curb antibiotic overuse in human medicine. Yet today it is estimated \nthat 70 percent of the antimicrobials used in the United States are fed \nto farm animals for non-therapeutic purposes including growth \npromotion, poor management practices and crowded, unsanitary \nconditions.\n  In March 2003, the National Academies of Sciences stated that a \ndecrease in antimicrobial use in human medicine alone will not solve \nthe problem of drug resistance. Substantial efforts must be made to \ndecrease inappropriate overuse of antibiotics in animals and \nagriculture.\n  Last week five major medical and environmental groups--the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics, the American Public Health Association, \nEnvironmental Defense, the Food Animal Concerns Trust and the Union of \nConcerned Scientists--jointly filed a formal regulatory petition with \nthe U.S. Food and Drug Administration urging the agency to withdraw \napprovals for seven classes of antibiotics which are used as \nagricultural feed additives. They pointed out what we have known for \nyears--that antibiotics which are crucial to treating human disease \nshould never be used except for their intended purpose--to treat \ndisease.\n  In a study just reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, \nresearchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found 17 \npercent of drug-resistant staph infections had no apparent links to \nhealth-care settings. Nearly one in five of these resistant infections \narose in the community--not in the health care setting. While must do \nmore to address inappropriate antibiotic use in medicine, and use in \nour environment cannot be ignored.\n  This is why I have joined with Senator Kennedy to again introduce the \n``Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act''. This bill \nphases out the non-therapeutic uses of critical medically important \nantibiotics in livestock and poultry production, unless their \nmanufacturers can show that they pose no danger to public health. I am \npleased that we have been joined in this effort by Senator Collins, \nSenator Landrieu, and Senator Reed in introducing this measure.\n  Our legislation requires the Food and Drug Administration to withdraw \nthe approval for nontherapeutic agricultural use of antibiotics in \nfood-producing animals if the antibiotic is used for treating human \ndisease, unless the application is proven harmless within two years. \nThe same tough standard of safety will apply to new applications for \napproval of animal antibiotics.\n  This legislation places no unreasonable burden on producers. It does \nnot restrict the use of antibiotics to treat sick animals, or for that \nmatter to treat pets and other animals not used for food. The act \nauthorizes Federal payments to small family farms to defray their \ncosts, and it also establishes research and demonstration programs that \nreduce the use of antibiotics in raising food-producing animals. The \nact also requires data collection from manufacturers so that the types \nand amounts of antibiotics used in animals can be monitored.\n  As we are constantly reminded, the discovery and development of a new \ndrug can require great time and expense. It is simply common sense that \nwe preserve the use of the drugs which we already have, and use them \nappropriately. I call on my colleagues to support us in this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/11/senate-section/article/S3408-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3408-S3409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL CRIME VICTIMS' RIGHTS WEEK\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday marked the beginning of National \nCrime Victims' Rights Week. For a quarter of a century, we have set \nthis week aside each year to renew our commitment to address the needs \nof victims and their families and to promote victims' rights.\n  This year's commemoration comes at a critical juncture in the history \nof the victims' rights movement. Much has been achieved in the past 25 \nyears to provide victims with greater rights and assistance, but \nperhaps none so important as the passage of the Victims of Crime Act of \n1984, VOCA, and its establishment of a dedicated source of funds to \nsupport victims' services. The Crime Victims Fund provides critical \nfunding that helps millions of victims of all types of crime every \nyear. The future of the fund is in doubt, however, and 25 years of \nprogress may be at risk due to the administration's proposal to rescind \nall amounts remaining in the fund at the end of fiscal year 2006--an \nestimated $1.267 billion. That would dry up the fund, leaving it with a \nbalance of zero going into fiscal year 2007 to support vital victim \nservices.\n  Our new Attorney General, upon his confirmation, gave a speech to \ndiscuss his priorities for the Department of Justice. He stated, ``As \nwe battle crime, we must also defend the rights of crime victims and \nassist them in their recovery.'' While I agree on the importance of \nthis goal, rescinding the Crime Victims Fund is not the way to achieve \nit.\n  The Crime Victims Fund is the Nation's premier vehicle for the \nsupport of victims' services. Nearly 90 percent of the fund is used to \naward State crime victim compensation and victim assistance formula \ngrants. VOCA-funded victim assistance programs serve nearly 4 million \ncrime victims each year, including victims of domestic violence, sexual \nassault, child abuse, elder abuse, and drunk driving, as well as \nsurvivors of homicide victims. VOCA-funded compensation programs have \nhelped hundreds of thousands of victims of violent crime.\n  The Crime Victims Fund also serves victims of Federal crimes. VOCA \nfunding supports victim assistance services provided by U.S. Attorneys \nOffices and the FBI, as well as the Federal victim notification system. \nIt is used for child abuse prevention and treatment grants, and it is \nalso used to provide emergency relief to victims of terrorism and mass \nviolence.\n  Since fiscal year 2000, Congress has set a cap on annual fund \nobligations expressly for the purpose of ensuring ``that a stable level \nof funding will remain available for these programs in future years.'' \nThe ``rainy day'' fund created by this spending cap has been used to \nmake up the difference between annual deposits and distributions three \ntimes during the past six years.\n  When Congress began considering caps on fund obligations, I proposed \nand Congress enacted an amendment to the Victims of Crime Act to \nclarify our intent to stabilize and preserve the fund for the benefit \nof victims. The amendment, now codified at section 10601(c) of title \n42, requires that ``. . . all sums deposited in the Fund in any fiscal \nyear that are not made available for obligation by Congress in the \nsubsequent fiscal year shall remain in the\n\n[[Page S3409]]\n\nFund for obligation in future fiscal years, without fiscal year \nlimitation.'' Thus, in both the authorization and the appropriations \nprocesses, Congress has clearly and emphatically stated its intent to \nmaintain a stable source of federal support for essential victim \nservices.\n  Over the past 4 years, the Bush administration and this Republican \nCongress have squandered record surpluses and racked up $7.6 trillion \nin Federal debt as a result of reckless spending and budget-busting tax \ncuts. Now the Bush administration proposes to reduce the deficit by \nsiphoning off resources that we set aside to assist victims of crime. \nIn this regard, it bears emphasis that the Crime Victims Fund does not \nreceive appropriated funding; deposits come from Federal criminal \nfines, forfeited bail bonds, penalties, and special assessments, not \nfrom the pockets of American taxpayers.\n  Together with Senators Biden and Schumer, I wrote to President Bush \non March 11, 2005, to urge him to reconsider and withdraw his proposal \nto rescind the Crime Victims Fund. We received no response to that \nletter.\n  On March 17, 2005, I offered and the Senate approved by voice vote a \nbudget resolution amendment intended to head off the administration's \nplans to raid the Crime Victims Fund. I was joined by Senators Kennedy, \nMikulski, Feingold, Biden, Durbin, Obama and Dodd, and I thank them \nagain for their support. As amended, the budget resolution passed by \nthe Senate rejects the proposed rescission by assuming that all amounts \nthat have been and will be deposited into the Crime Victims Fund, \nincluding all amounts to be deposited in fiscal year 2006 and \nthereafter, will remain in the fund for use as authorized by the \nVictims of Crime Act.\n  In every State and every community across the country, the Crime \nVictims Fund plays an essential role in helping crime victims and their \nfamilies meet critical expenses, recover from the horrific crimes they \nendured, and move forward with their lives. I ask unanimous consent to \nprint in the Record a letter from a number of victims' organizations, \nrepresenting the millions of Americans who become victims of crime \nevery year. They wrote that rescinding the Crime Victims Fund at the \nend of fiscal year 2006 would create a ``disastrous'' situation for \nvictim service providers and their clients.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             National Crime Victim\n\n\n                                 Organizations Contact Groups,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 2005.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: We, the undersigned members of the \n     National Crime Victim Organizations Contact Group, represent \n     the millions of citizens that become victims of crime every \n     year in our nation and the agencies that provide supportive \n     services to them. The Crime Victims Fund provides crucial \n     support to thousands of nonprofit organizations and public \n     agencies who help millions of crime victims. We have joined \n     together to urge all members of Congress to oppose the \n     Administration's proposal to remove $1.2 billion from this \n     essential and life-saving fund.\n       The Fund was created under the Victims of Crime Act in 1984 \n     as a ``separate account'' meaning that the revenues in the \n     Fund are intended to be used solely for financial support of \n     victim services, primarily through State crime victim \n     compensation and State victim assistance formula grants. The \n     Fund comes from the collection of Federal criminal fines, \n     forfeitures and assessments; it does not depend on general \n     taxpayer appropriations. Since the Fund's inception, Congress \n     directed that all amounts deposited into the Fund would \n     remain available to support victim services ``without fiscal \n     year limitation.''\n       Over 4,400 victim service agencies in every state and every \n     district depend upon VOCA funding for essential victim \n     services, such as emergency shelters, counseling, legal \n     advocacy, and assistance participating in the criminal \n     justice system. In FY 2003, 3.8 million crime victims \n     received VOCA-funded assistance, including victims of \n     domestic violence, sexual assault, child abuse, elder abuse, \n     survivors of homicide victims and drunk driving crashes. \n     Hundreds of thousands of victims were provided financial \n     assistance through VOCA grants to State crime victim \n     compensation programs.\n       Initially, the money collected every year was released to \n     states the following year. When collections grew to nearly $1 \n     billion in fines in FY 1999, Congress placed a cap on the \n     amount that was distributed each year. Congress began \n     limiting annual Fund obligations expressly ``to ensure that a \n     stable level of funding will remain available for these \n     programs in future years'' (Conference Report 106-479).\n       Capping annual Fund obligations created a Fund balance--a \n     ``rainy day'' fund consisting of amounts that otherwise would \n     have been used by States to support immediate victim \n     assistance needs. The Fund balance was used to make up the \n     difference between annual deposits and Congressional caps \n     three times over the past six years.\n       Having recently recognized the 20th anniversary of this \n     successful and effective program, we were shocked to learn \n     that the Administration now proposes rescinding the entire \n     Fund at the end of FY 2006, including the amounts that \n     Congress promised and, in fact, needed to protect against \n     Fund fluctuations and to ensure the Fund's stability as well \n     as deposits made during FY 2006. More stable long-term \n     sources of funding are already required to maintain a \n     sufficient amount in the Fund. Rescinding the Fund will zero \n     out the Fund going into FY 2007 and unquestionably create a \n     disastrous situation for victim service providers and their \n     clients. The entire crime victims' field stands united in its \n     opposition to the proposed rescission.\n       We ask Congress to reject the Administration's \n     recommendation to rescind the Fund and to work with us to \n     guarantee the Fund's future viability and support for victim \n     services.\n           Sincerely,\n       David Beatty, Contact Group Coordinator, Justice Solutions, \n     NPO.\n       Jeanette Adkins, National Organization for Victim \n     Assistance.\n       Marybeth Carter, National Alliance to End Sexual Violence.\n       Nancy Chandler, National Children's Alliance.\n       Steve Derene, National Association of VOCA Assistance \n     Administrators.\n       Dan Eddy, National Association of Crime Victim Compensation \n     Boards.\n       Wendy Hamilton, Mothers Against Drunk Driving.\n       Mary Lou Leary, National Center for Victims of Crime.\n       Dan Levey, National Organization for Parents of Murdered \n     Children.\n       Jill Morris, National Coalition Against Domestic Violence.\n       Diane Moyer, Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape.\n       Lynn Rosenthal, National Network to End Domestic Violence.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, I bring to the Senate's attention the \nimportance of Freedom Park in Edwards, CO, to commemorate the \nsacrifices of our Armed Forces and emergency services personnel.\n  Similar to many other memorials, an American flag stands waving at \nits center, reflecting in the clear blue waters of a mountain lake. Yet \nthis monument differs from most in that it recognizes not only our \nArmed Forces but our emergency services. The liberties that we as \ncitizens hold dear today have been protected both abroad and \ndomestically, and this monument is a faithful reminder of all Americans \nwho have dedicated their lives to serving freedom.\n  The concept of Freedom Park began with local veterans in Edwards, CO, \nbut soon grew into a valley-wide, grassroots effort. Citizens from all \nwalks of life have come together to accomplish this noble goal, \nincluding military veterans and their families, emergency service \nmembers, business professionals, local government officials, and \ncountless others. The fruit of their labor will be recognized for \ngenerations to come in the name of commemorating American liberty.\n  From the Revolutionary War to the global war on terrorism, Freedom \nPark uniquely honors those who have given their lives in the line of \nduty throughout America's history. Clearly displayed at every entrance \nto the park, these words are posted: ``The greatest tribute we can give \nthem is to become wiser through their legacy.'' This quote demonstrates \nthe founders' goal, which is two-fold: to memorialize those who have \nserved in the name of freedom and to teach future generations the \nmeaning of the sacrifices that were made.\n  Freedom Park memorial appropriately holds the dedication of our men \nand women in the Armed Forces and emergency services in great esteem so \nthat we may honor their dedication to our Nation and learn from their \nsacrifices.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/11/senate-section/article/S3410-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3410]]\n                            FPI REFORM BILL\n\n  Mr. BURNS.

Mr. President, I would like to bring to the \nSenate's attention the retirement of a Colorado native from the U.S. \nArmy, LTC Julia Cook.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Cook has distinguished herself with exceptionally \nmeritorious conduct while serving in key positions of ever increasing \nresponsibility as an Army quartermaster and human resources officer, \nculminating her career as a legislative liaison for Secretary of the \nArmy, Office of the Chief Legislative Liaison. During her years of \nsuperlative service, Lieutenant Colonel Cook consistently demonstrated \nexceptional leadership, resourcefulness and professionalism while \nmaking lasting contributions to Army soldiers and families, readiness \nand mission accomplishment. Lieutenant Colonel Cook's 20 years of \ndedicated and faithful service enhanced the soldiers and the units to \nwhich she was assigned and reflects the greatest credit upon herself \nand the U.S. Army.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Cook was commissioned a second lieutenant through \nthe ROTC program, Quartermaster Corps, after graduating from the \nUniversity of Colorado in December 1984. Her first assignment, \nfollowing the quartermaster officer basic course, was to Ft. Leonard \nWood, MO, from 1985 to 1986, serving as XO for an AIT company that \ntrained 63Bs and 64Cs and as an assistant brigade S4. She volunteered \nto serve in Korea from 1986 to 1988, distinguishing herself as tech \nsupply platoon leader in 595th Maintenance Company, K-16 Air Base and \nas battalion S1, 227th Maintenance Battalion, Youngman. Following her \ntour in Korea, she completed the quartermaster officer advance course \nand was assigned to Ft. Carson, CO, from 1988 to 1993. Again she served \nsuperbly in a variety of positions, as the 4th ID DISCOM support \noperations officer; the S2/3, 704th Main Support Battalion; as \ncommander, Company C, 704th Main Support Battalion; and as the division \nequal opportunity officer. She also deployed on a 6-month rotation to \nJTF-B, Honduras, serving as the logistics plans officer. From 1993 to \n1997 she performed her duties as a soldier assigned to Headquarters, \nU.S. Army Materiel Command, AMC. She served in a variety of positions \nincluding, logistics operations officer in the Emergency Operations \nCenter, staff action control officer for the Secretary of the General \nStaff, executive officer for the Chief of Staff, special project \nofficer to Project Manager Soldier, and team executive officer for the \nSecretary of the Army's Senior Review Panel on Sexual Harassment after \nthe Aberdeen Proving Ground Sexual Harassment scandal.\n  After graduation from the Command and General Staff College, she was \nassigned to the 21st Theater Support Command, Kaiserslautern, Germany, \nfrom 1998 to 2001. While overseas, she served as chief, Distribution \nManagement Center, where she developed supply distribution initiatives \nfor a command supporting over 65,000 soldiers in European-based units. \nLieutenant Colonel Cook's work enabled the Command to reduce shipping \ncosts through the air challenge process by $2 million for the first two \nquarters of fiscal year 1999. She served as executive officer of the \n191st Ordnance Battalion, Miesau, Germany, and was responsible for \ninternal operations of a 600-soldier battalion consisting of a \nheadquarters and headquarters company, an ammunition company, a \nquartermaster rigging detachment, and two explosive ordnance disposal \ncompanies, all while exercising oversight of a $2 million annual \nbudget. Lieutenant Colonel Cook finished her career serving with the \nArmy's office of the Chief of Legislative Liaison from August 2001 to \nMay 2005 where she was the staff action officer and legislative \nassistant to the Undersecretary of the Army and the Sergeant Major of \nthe Army. She prepared the Undersecretary and Sergeant Major for all \ninteractions with Congress including hearings, office calls, and phone \ncalls. Finally, she served in the program division as the Army \nlegislative liaison between the U.S. Congress and the Army staff for \nall issues related to logistics.\n\n  Through these assignments, Lieutenant Colonel Cook has provided \noutstanding leadership, advice, and sound professional judgment on \nnumerous critical issues of enduring importance to both the Army and \nCongress. Her actions and counsel were invaluable to Army leaders and \nMembers of Congress as they considered the impact of important issues. \nLieutenant Colonel Cook's dedication to accomplishing the Army's \nlegislative liaison mission has been extraordinary. She is truly an \noutstanding officer who displays superb professional leadership skills \nand is totally dedicated to mission accomplishment in the highest \ntraditions of military service, and I thank her for her service to this \ngreat Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/11/senate-section/article/S3410-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3410-S3411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RETIREMENT OF BILLY ROSS BROWN\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, my friend, Billy Ross Brown, has \nretired from the First South Farm Credit, ACA Board of Directors where \nhe served faithfully for many years.\n  Billy Ross became a director on the Oxford, MS, PCA Board in 1968 and \nhe served as chairman of the board from 1975 to 1985. He was then \nelected to serve on the First South Farm Credit Board and served from \n1985 to 1990.\n  He left the First South Board after being recommended by me and \nappointed by President George H.W. Bush to serve on the Board of the \nFarm Credit Administration and the Farm Credit System Insurance \nCorporation in Washington, DC. During this time he served as the first \nchairman of the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation where he \nnurtured it through its startup as a Federal agency and directed it as \nit began to capitalize the Farm Credit System insurance fund. He was \nsubsequently appointed chairman and CEO of the Farm Credit \nAdministration where he served with distinction until October 1974.\n  While at the FCA, he undertook the first critical internal review of \nthe agency, which provided him with useful insights and perspectives as \nhe guided the agency through a difficult period of adjustment, \nfollowing the system's financial stress in the mid-1980s. At his \nrecommendation and under his direction, FCA undertook its first efforts \nat relieving regulatory burdens. He authored the agency's first \nstatement on regulatory philosophy which reflected his commitment to \ncost-effective regulation and risk-based examination and supervision. \nIt was his belief that any cost savings or efficiencies derived by the \ncooperatively owned Farm Credit Institutions would ultimately benefit \nthe system's farmer borrowers and thereby benefit all agricultural \nproducers.\n  After Billy Ross moved back to Oxford from Washington, the First \nSouth Farm Credit nominating committee nominated Billy Ross to run \nagain for the First South Farm Credit Board. Billy Ross served again on \nthe First South Board from June 1999 until his mandatory retirement in \nMarch 2005.\n  Billy Ross has served the Farm Credit System and U.S. agricultural \ninterests for over 36 years. Combined with\n\n[[Page S3411]]\n\nhis father's service to the Farm Credit and the local PCA, the \nimmediate Brown family has over 55 years of service to American \nagriculture.\n  No person has served First South Farm Credit, ACA, the Farm Credit \nAdministration, and the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation with \nmore loyalty, dignity, and honor than Billy Ross Brown.\n  Over the years, I have observed Billy Ross' dedicated service to his \nfamily, his community and his country. He is a true gentleman with a \ngreat heart and love for all mankind.\n  While I wish him well in his retirement, I suspect he will continue \nto be involved in the ongoing success of Mississippi agricultural \ninterests and I hope he will still find time to fish with his friends, \nbut only if the weather is good.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/11/senate-section/article/S3411-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONGRATULATIONS TO BERNICE DICKERSON\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, it is with great pride that I \ncommemorate the 125th anniversary of the founding of the Missionary \nSisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus whose assistance to New York's \nItalian community in the late 19th century is a model for immigrant \noutreach. The efforts of the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart of \nJesus initiated by the first American citizen saint, Frances Cabrini, \nled the Vatican to name her Patroness of Immigrants.\n  From the missionary sisters' first New York initiative, a home for \ndestitute Italian orphans that opened in 1889, to the vibrant network \nof schools, hospitals and social service agencies serving immigrants in \nNew Jersey, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, Illinois, Colorado, Washington \nState and California, as well as New York, the missionary sisters \nbrought solace to immigrants in both urban and rural areas, visiting \nthem in homes, public hospitals, prisons and mines. Today this enduring \nmission flourishes in 16 nations on six continents where the Cabrinian \nreligious institute eases misery, works for justice, and educates new \ngenerations. The institute's compassionate work cares for AIDS orphans \nin Swaziland and street children in the Philippines, provides health \nand child care and educates young people in Australia, Central and \nSouth America and the United States.\n  Frances Cabrini's legacy can be seen in 21st century New York State \nin Dobbs Ferry at the St. Cabrini Nursing Home and the Cabrini Elder \nCare Consortium. Dobbs Ferry is also home to the Monsignor Terence \nAttridge Adult Day Health Center and Cabrini Immigrant Services. New \nYork City is fortunate to have the Cabrini Center for Nursing and \nRehabilitation, Cabrini Care at Home, Cabrini Immigrant Services, \nCabrini Hospital, Sister Josephine Tsuei Senior Day Services, Cabrini \nHigh School, the Cabrini Shrine and the Cabrini Housing Development \nFund's apartments for the elderly.\n  This year the St. Cabrini Nursing Home honors two individuals who \nexemplify the dedication and service of the Cabrinian values--Donna \nMcNamara whose efforts were crucial to the creation of Cabrini \nImmigrant Services and Cabrini Care at Home; and James A. Smith, \nlongtime board member who has given leadership to the Cabrini Elder \nCare Consortium. I am thankful for the efforts of Ms. McNamara and Mr. \nSmith and for the 125 years of compassion and care that are hallmarks \nof the life of Frances Cabrini and those who continue to serve the \nideals to which she dedicated her life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/11/senate-section/article/S3411-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              NCAA DIVISION III MEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPION\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \ncongratulate the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point men's basketball \nteam for their second straight NCAA Division III national championship. \nThe Pointers capped off a dominating run through the tournament with \ntheir victory over Rochester University in the championship game. With \nthe victory, the Pointers become just the third team in NCAA Division \nIII history to win back to back titles. The championship game was also \na milestone for Head Coach Jack Bennett, who earned his 200th career \nvictory with the win and has since been selected as the Basketball \nTimes Coach of the Year.\n  The Pointers posted a terrific 29-3 record this season, winning many \nof their games by wide margins and tying the school record for wins in \na season set last year. The Pointers had the stingiest defense in the \nWisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference this season, allowing \njust over 56 points a game. They also outscored their opponents by an \noverwhelming average of 17 points per game. Stevens Point led their \nconference in many statistical categories, including three-point and \noverall shooting percentage and assists. Their tough play throughout \nthe season earned them a share of the conference championship. The \nPointers also won their second straight WIAC Tournament title.\n  A talented roster of student-athletes, led by All-American Nick \nBennett and Division III Men's Basketball Player of the Year Jason \nKalsow, played unselfishly and always with passion. Members of the \nUniversity of Wisconsin-Stevens Point men's basketball team that fought \nhard for the championship include senior Tamaris Relerford from Beloit, \nWI; freshman Shawn Lee from Marshfield, WI; sophomore Brett Hirsch from \nMenomonee Falls, WI; freshman Brad Kalsow from Huntley, IL; freshman \nSteve Hicklin from Sussex, WI; senior Kyle Grusczynski from Seymour, \nWI; sophomore Cory Krautkramer from Cameron, WI; sophomore Jon Krull \nfrom Marshall, WI; junior Matt Bouche from Dane, WI; junior Brian Bauer \nfrom Auburndale, WI; junior Mike Prey from Shawano, WI; senior Eric \nMaus from Green Bay, WI; freshman Gbena Awe from Milwaukee, WI; \nfreshman Tyler Doyle from Appleton, WI; freshman Matt Atkinson from \nSuamico, WI; senior John Gleich from Wheaton, IL; and freshman Zach \nLeahy from Hartland, WI. Many of these champions are volunteers in the \ncommunity at basketball camps and with Big Brothers and Big Sisters. \nThey are also students dedicated to academics as well as to basketball.\n  The team's competitive spirit is an inspiration to youngsters in \nWisconsin. When March Madness is in the air, Division III may not \nalways be in the spotlight. But the Pointers' second straight national \nchampionship is a trophy all Wisconsinites are proud of. Their victory \nis a substantial part of the incredible postseason for Wisconsin \ncollege basketball teams.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/11/senate-section/article/S3411-4", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/11/senate-section/article/S3411-5", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Intelligence.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/11/senate-section/article/S3411-6", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3411-S3413]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-1545.

A bill to amend the Global Environmental Protection \nAssistance Act of 1989 to promote international clean energy \ndevelopment, to open and expand clean energy markets abroad, to engage \ndeveloping nations in the advancement of sustainable energy use and \nclimate change actions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the International \nClean Energy Deployment and Global Energy Markets Investment Act of \n2005. This is a forward-thinking, made-in-America action plan that can \nserve as a building block that puts the right structure and mechanisms \nin place, mobilizes the necessary resources, and helps define the \ncourse we will have to take in order to better design the global energy \nsystem that will be built in coming decades. But let me also state up \nfront what this legislation does not do. It is not intended to be a \nsubstitute for the need to seek globally binding climate change \nagreements that would include commitments from the largest industrial \nand developing country emitters of greenhouse gases. However, my \nlegislation can serve as a meaningful first step to seriously engage \ndeveloping countries in tackling the critical link between our mutual \nenergy and climate change challenges. Additionally, such engagement can \nbe a new cornerstone for the U.S. to demonstrate that we are committed \nto working with other nations on a broad range of international issues.\n  We must start by honestly addressing several bottom line issues. We \nknow that the world's population will likely grow by about 50 percent \nduring this century, and those people, most of whom will live in \ndeveloping nations, will be seeking the necessary resources to live. \nThese nations will be growing rapidly and their requirements for energy \nwill follow suit for the foreseeable future. But at the same time, we \nknow that growth needs to be undertaken in as clean and efficient a \nmanner as possible. When economies heat up so does energy use, \ngreenhouse gas emissions, and that global change. How can any nation's \neconomy continue to grow and provide good jobs in a way that does not \nundermine its environment and vice versa? How do we find ways to \naddress these problems of mutual concern for our citizens and for their \nchildren and grandchildren? These issues matter as much in the United \nStates as they do in places in China, India, Brazil, and Mexico.\n  This legislation's journey began several years when I included, in \nthe fiscal year 2001 Energy and Water Appropriations bill, language \nthat called for a clean energy exports and market development strategic \nplan. The Bush administration sent that report to Congress in October \n2002. Since that time, I have been urging, cajoling, and pushing \nFederal agencies like the Department of State, Department of Energy, \nDepartment of Commerce, and the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment to cooperate more and increase public/private efforts to \nhelp export U.S. clean energy technologies and open more of these \nmarkets abroad. It is now time to take the next step and introduce this \nlegislation in order to expand upon that foundation.\n  By taking this next step, I am suggesting that we must work together \nto develop a broad-based action plan that builds on American ingenuity, \nencourages the export of made-in-America clean energy technologies, \nhelps advance developing country climate change engagement, increases \ninternational sustainable development, and strengthens interagency and \npublic/private cooperation. The objectives of this legislation further \ninclude efforts to increase access to clean and reliable energy \nservices, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase energy security, \nand integrate these goals in a manner that is consistent with U.S. \nforeign policy interests around the world. Finally, my legislation \nessentially codifies and enhances the administrative structure that has \nalready been put in place.\n  On a related but separate note, I am very aware that on February 16, \n2005, the Kyoto Protocol came into force. As the primary author of \nSenate Resolution 98, which passed unanimously in 1997, I worked to \nestablish core principles which should be part of any future binding, \ninternational climate change agreement. Those principles were that a \ntreaty should be cost effective and should include the participation of \ndeveloping nations, especially the largest emitters. The Kyoto Protocol \ndoes not meet those principles for the United States.\n  There have been widely varying interpretations of that resolution, \nespecially by the Bush administration. The Byrd-Hagel resolution was \nintended to guide our Nation's role in international negotiations, not \nkill that effort. It was meant to strengthen the hand of\n\n[[Page S3417]]\n\nany administration as it sat at the international negotiating table, \nbut this White House has used the Senate's vote as an excuse to totally \nabandon the negotiations and offer, instead, only hollow alternatives. \nYet, it is the height of hypocrisy for the Bush administration to claim \nthat it is defending that resolution's principles when, as a matter of \nfact, it has disregarded its very purpose.\n  That Senate resolution directed that any climate change treaty \ninclude commitments for the developing world, like China and India, \nwhich will surpass the U.S. in greenhouse gas emissions by 2025. These \ncommitments could lead to real reductions. An international treaty with \nbinding commitments also could allow for developing countries' \ncontinued economic growth with relatively modest requirements at first, \npacing upwards, with ultimate goals to be achieved over time.\n  Moreover, given their expected economic growth and energy demands, \ndeveloping nations are a primary market for clean energy technologies. \nBut, this multi-billion dollar window of opportunity could close for \nthe United States. With little pressure on developing countries to \nreduce or contain their emissions growth, these potentially enormous \nmarkets for clean energy technologies, made in the U.S., could slip \naway. Thus, my legislation can serve as a commonsense foot-in-the-door \nto help jump start efforts to seek fair and effective globally binding \nagreements in the future.\n  Despite this, the President has clearly stated that the U.S. would \nonly pursue voluntary measures both domestically and internationally, \nand he continues to follow that path despite the fact that no major \nenvironmental problem has ever been solved by a purely voluntary basis. \nSince retreating from the international forum, his own climate change \nprogram is a strong testament to prove that voluntary actions are not \nlikely to result in any serious decrease in overall emissions. While \nglobal climate change is long-term problem, it does not mean that we \ncan put off action indefinitely. If we wait for decades to take more \nsignificant actions, then more radical measures will likely be \nnecessary.\n  Additionally, I have long said that the U.S. needs a comprehensive, \nnational energy strategy that has bipartisan support. A serious energy \nefficiency program, bolstered by the promotion of renewable energy and \nother clean home-grown energy sources, provides a compass point for a \nU.S. energy strategy. At its core, we must rely on our nation's \ndomestic energy assets, especially coal. Coal must become a primary \nfuel source for new energy demands into the 21st century. However, to \ndo so requires that we think differently about coal.\n  It is a myth to say that the U.S. or other major nations like China \nand India will stop burning coal any time soon. Yet, we must begin to \ntreat this plentiful resource like black gold and use it in a much \ncleaner and more efficient way. We must accelerate the deployment of \ncommercial-scale technologies that move us away from simply burning \ncoal toward the enhanced ability to transform coal into a variety of \nenergy products. We can begin to meet this challenge by demonstrating \nand deploying advanced power generation, especially coal gasification \nand carbon sequestration technologies, as well as by producing \nsynthetic fuels and, eventually, hydrogen for use in other sectors of \nthe economy. This broad approach also requires sending strong and clear \nregulatory and market signals which can significantly reconcile \nnumerous environmental and climate change concerns, stimulate \ntechnology deployment, and set the stage for coal into the future.\n  The path that I am proposing here today goes far beyond the energy \nproposals that this White House has offered. Pursuing this course will \ntake steadfast leadership, hard work, and American ingenuity to move \nforward in a responsible, balanced, and intelligent way. It is time for \nindustry, labor, academic, environmental, and community interests to \nwork with policymakers to find common ground. Commonsense market-based \nand regulatory approaches, emerging technology platforms, and new \npolicy perspectives can bring these divergent groups together.\n  I believe it is time to send the message that there will likely be a \nbinding carbon management regime in place for the U.S. at some point in \nthe future. It may not be in place tomorrow or the next day or even in \nthe next 2 to 4 years. It may also be a modest approach initially, but \nit is on the horizon. We certainly cannot run until we have walked, and \nwe cannot walk until we have taken a step. But we can no longer stand \nstill forever. By acting boldly, we can champion a new energy and \nenvironmental legacy that will benefit all the world's citizens.\n  With regard to my legislation's introduction today, our Nation must \nrecognize the incredible impact that U.S. technologies and ideas can \nhave in helping to meet other nations' energy needs in a more \nsustainable way. We must work to open and expand international markets \nfor a range of U.S. clean energy technologies and simultaneously \naddress global energy security, economic, trade, and environmental \nobjectives.\n  I thank you for this opportunity and hope this legislation will \nreceive serious consideration. I urge Members to see this as a key \ncomponent of the architecture that will be necessary if we ever hope to \nseriously tackle the tough energy and environment issues before us as \nwell as a way to enhance our broader foreign policy and climate change \nefforts around the world.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 745\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

These \nwater recycling projects will produce approximately 100,000 acre-feet \nof new water annually in one of the most rapidly growing regions in the \nUnited States.\n  The legislation would authorize two project components: the first of \nwhich will be constructed by the Inland Empire Utilities Agency, IEUA \nand will produce approximately 90,000 acre feet of new water annually. \nThe second of these projects, to be constructed by the Cucamonga Valley \nWater District CVWD, will produce an additional 5,000 acre feet of new \nwater annually. Combined, approximately 100,000 acre feet of new water \nwould be produced locally by 2010, reducing the need for imported water \nfrom the Colorado River and northern California through the California \nWater Project.\n  Significantly, the Federal cost share is only 10 percent of the \nupfront capital costs.\n  We must continue to approve measures preventing water supply \nshortages in the Western United States. The Inland Empire region is one \nof the fastest growing areas in the nation. This legislation means that \nthe Inland Empire will use less water from the Colorado River and \nnorthern California, and the bill will have other benefits like \nimproved water quality, energy savings, and job creation.\n  The development of recycled water has enormous capacity to produce \nsignificant amounts of water, and have it ``on line'' in a relatively \nshort period of time. Recycled water provides our State and region with \nthe ability to ``stretch'' existing water supplies significantly and in \nso doing, minimize conflict and address the many needs that exist. \nAccording to the State of California's Recycled Water Task Force, water \nrecycling is a critical part of California's water future with an \nestimated 1.5 million acre-feet of new supplies being developed over \nthe next 25 years.\n  Today's Commissioner of Reclamation said it best when, in a speech to \nthe WateReuse Association he declared that recycled water is ``the last \nriver to tap.''\n  IEUA produces recycled water for a variety of non-potable purposes, \nsuch as landscape irrigation, agricultural irrigation, construction, \nand industrial cooling. By replacing these water-intensive applications \nwith high-quality recycled water, fresh water can be conserved or used \nfor drinking, thereby reducing the dependence on expensive imported \nwater.\n  As we look into the future, it is appropriate that we are guided by \nlessons from the recent past. In the late 1980's, California confronted \na sustained, multi-year drought. It was so serious that some observed \nthat our State had 6-year-old first graders who had never seen ``green \ngrass.'' California faced a crisis and water agencies and water \ndistricts, particularly in Southern California found a solution--\nrecycled water.\n  In 1991, the Secretary of the Interior in President George H.W. \nBush's administration, Manual Lujan, recognized that California was \nreceiving more water from the Colorado River than its allocation. The \nInterior Secretary looked into the future and saw a day when California \nwould get its allocation--4.4. million acre-feet, but no longer would \nit get up to 800,000 acre-feet of ``surplus flows.'' As is well known, \nthat day has arrived.\n\n  For any political leader, it's always a tremendous challenge to look \ninto the future and design programs and solutions to a crisis. \nSecretary Lujan did exactly that. In August 1991, he launched the \nSouthern California Water Initiative, a program to evaluate and study \nthe feasibility of water reclamation projects. Mr. Lujan's vision was \nto build replacement water capacity to offset the anticipated Colorado \nRiver water supply reductions. In this endeavor, Secretary Lujan was \nassisted by then Commissioner of Reclamation Dennis Underwood. Last \nweek, Mr. Underwood was selected by the Metropolitan Water District of \nSouthern California, MWD, board of directors as their new general \nmanager and CEO.\n  Congress saw the wisdom of the Lujan initiative too. Congress, in \n1992, was completing work on major water legislation. The Lujan \ninitiative, a year after it was first announced, became Title XVI, the \nBureau of Reclamation water recycling program that today serves the \nentire West, not just California. Today, water recycling is an \nessential water supply element in Albuquerque, Phoenix, Denver, Salt \nLake City, Tucson, El Paso, San Antonio, Portland and other western \nmetropolitan areas.\n  The Inland Empire Regional Water Recycling Initiative has the support \nof all member agencies of IEUA, as well as the water agencies \ndownstream in Orange County. IEUA encompasses approximately 242 square \nmiles and serves the cities of Chino, Chino Hills, Fontana, through the \nFontana Water Company, Ontario, Upland, Montclair, Rancho Cucamonga \nthrough the Cucamonga Valley Water District, and the Monte Vista Water \nDistrict.\n  This bill is also supported by and fully consistent with the \nMetropolitan Water District of Southern California, MWD's Integrated \nResource Plan, Santa Ana Watershed Project Authority, SAWPA's \nIntegrated Watershed Plan, and the Chino Basin Watermaster's Optimum \nBasin Management Plan, Inland Empire Utility Agency's Feasibility \nStudy, Cucamonga Valley Water District's ``Every Drop Counts'' Urban \nWater Reuse Management Strategy, the Bureau of Reclamation's Southern \nCalifornia Comprehensive Water Recycling and Reuse Feasibility Study, \nthe State of California's Water Recycling Task Force, the WateReuse \nAssociation, the Association of California Water Agencies, ACWA and the \nU.S. Department of the Interior's Water 2025 Initiative.\n  Environmental groups such as the Mono Lake Committee, Environmental \nDefense, Clean Water and Natural Resources Defense Council strongly \nsupport recycling projects. Business leaders such as Southern Cal \nEdison and Building Industry Association also support these water \nrecycling projects.\n  These projects were authorized for feasibility study in Public Law \n102-575, Title XVI, Section 1606, the Southern California Comprehensive \nWater Recycling and Reuse Feasibility Study in 1992. The State of \nCalifornia, Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, SAWPA \nand others provided $3 million of the $6 million required for the \nregional feasibility study of which these projects were one part.\n  Detailed Feasibility Studies and environmentally reports have been \nprepared and approved by both agencies and certified by the State of \nCalifornia.\n  Congressman David Dreier introduced identical legislation in the \nHouse in the 108th Congress. The House Resources Committee and then the \nHouse of Representatives both passed the bill unanimously.\n  His bill is cosponsored by Representatives Gary Miller, Grace \nNapolitano, Ken Calvert and Joe Baca.\n  And these valuable recycling projects would never have progressed at \nall without the hard work and dedication of Mr. Robert DeLoach, general \nmanager of the Cucamonga Valley Water District, and Mr. Rich Atwater, \nCEO and general manager of the Inland Empire Utilities Agency.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the\n\n[[Page S3421]]\n\ntext of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 746\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act \nto establish a governmentwide policy requiring competition in certain \nexecutive agency procurements, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators Craig \nThomas, Chuck Grassley and Debbie Stabenow in introducing the Federal \nPrison Industries Competition in Contracting Act. Our bill is based on \na straightforward premise: it is unfair for Federal Prison Industries \nto deny businesses in the private sector an opportunity to compete for \nsales to their own government.\n  We have made immeasurable progress on this issue since I first \nintroduced a similar bill ten years ago. It may seem incredible, but at \nthat time, Federal Prison Industries (FPI) could bar private sector \ncompanies from competing for a federal contract. Under the law \nestablishing Federal Prison Industries, if Federal Prison Industries \nsaid that it wanted a contract, it would get that contract, regardless \nwhether a company in the private sector could provide the product \nbetter, cheaper, or faster.\n  Four years ago, the Senate took a giant step toward addressing this \ninequity when we voted 74-24 to end Federal Prison Industries' monopoly \non Department of Defense contracts. Not only was that provision enacted \ninto law, we were able to strengthen it with a second provision in last \nyear's defense bill. Last year, we took another important step, \nenacting an appropriations provision which extends the DOD rules to \nother Federal agencies. This means that, for the first time, private \nsector companies should be able to compete against for contracts \nawarded by all Federal agencies.\n  Despite this progress, work remains to be done. We have heard reports \nfrom federal procurement officials and from small businesses that FPI \ncontinues to claim that it retains the mandatory source status that \nprotected it from competition for so long. This kind of misleading \nstatement may undermine the right to compete that we have fought so \nhard for so long to establish.\n  In addition, FPI continues to sell its services into interstate \ncommerce on an unlimited basis. I am concerned that the sale of prison \nlabor into commerce could have the effect of undermining companies and \nwork forces that are already in a weakened position as a result of \nforeign competition. We have long taken the position as a nation that \nprison-made goods should not be sold into commerce, where prison wages \nof a few cents per hour could too easily undercut private sector \ncompetition. It is hard for me to understand why the sale of services \nshould be treated any differently than the sale of products.\n  The bill that we are introducing today would address these issues by \nmaking it absolutely clear that FPI no longer has a mandatory source \nstatus, by reaffirming the critical requirement that FPI compete for \nits contracts, and by carefully limiting the circumstances under which \nprison services may be sold into the private sector economy.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on these important \nissues, and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 749\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The amendments made by this Act shall take effect 180 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n  Mr. THOMAS. President, today I am pleased to join Senator Levin in \nintroducing a bill that will further my efforts to limit unfair \ngovernment competition with the private sector. Throughout my career in \npublic office, I have always taken the position that government should \nnot compete unfairly with American small businesses. If a function or \nproduct is available in the private sector, then that should be the \nfirst avenue of choice as opposed to having that function provided by \ngovernment.\n  For several years now, Federal Prison Industries (FPI), a government \nentity with the purpose of keeping prisoners busy while serving their \nsentences, has been providing a growing variety of products and \nservices to both the Federal Government and the private sector. \nCurrently, FPI employs approximately 21,000 Federal prisoners or \nroughly 12 percent of a population of 174,000. These prisoners are \nresponsible for producing a diverse range of products for FPI, ranging \nfrom office furniture to clothing, as well as providing a variety of \nservices, including telemarketing. The remaining Federal prisoners who \nwork do so in and around Federal prisons.\n  Through its status as a sole provider of certain goods to the Federal \nGovernment, FPI has effectively blocked private sector businesses from \nhaving a chance to provide products, even though they may be able to \nprovide a better product in a more cost effective and efficient manner. \nThis situation is not in the best interest of the American taxpayer and \nis blatantly unfair to American small businesses across the country. \nAlong with Senators Grassley and Stabenow, Senator Levin and I propose \nto enact thorough and lasting reforms to Federal Prison Industries that \nwould ensure that they no longer compete unfairly with private sector \nsmall businesses.\n  We have already taken steps to remedy the situation. In last year's \nOmnibus Appropriations bill, language was included that prohibited \nfunding for sole source products from FPI and subjected such \nprocurements to follow the competitive requirements set out in the \nFederal Acquisitions Regulations. However, there are questions as to \nwhether the mandatory sourcing requirement still remains under these \nregulations. Our bill makes it very clear to Federal Managers and \nFederal Prison Industries that contracting officers are to use \ncompetitive procedures for the procurement of products and services. \nThis approach allows federal agencies to select FPI for contracts if, \nas a result of a competitive process, FPI can meet that particular \nagency's requirements and the product or service is the best value \noffered at a fair and reasonable price. By removing FPI's status as the \nsole provider and subjecting procurement to competition, the above \noutlined provision in our bill places the control of government \nprocurement in the hands of contracting officers and allows them to \npursue the most cost effective and efficient use of taxpayer dollars.\n  While we believe that it is important to keep prisoners working, we \ndo not believe that this effort should unduly harm or conflict with \nlaw-abiding businesses. This bill seeks to minimize the unfair \ncompetition that private sector companies face with the FPI. As FPI \ncontinues to expand its reach into providing services, the low costs of \ninmate labor is undercutting private sector businesses that provide \nsimilar services. The result is an unfair advantage for FPI. While \nallowing for the conclusion of current contracts, this bill also looks \nto limit services provided by inmates that compete with the private \nsector in interstate commerce. Additionally, the bill prohibits FPI \nfrom production of goods or services in which an inmate would have \naccess to classified or sensitive data.\n  We support the goal of keeping prisoners busy while serving their \ntime in prison. But FPI should not be placed in a position of advantage \nwhen providing goods to the federal government, and these activities \nshould not unfairly compete with services already provided in the \nprivate sector. However, I recognize that there may be cases in which a \nparticular contract is deemed essential to the safety and effective \nadministration of a particular prison. To deal with these exceptions, a \nprovision is included that allows the Attorney General to grant a \nwaiver to these reform measures in certain cases.\n  In addition to bringing a halt to unfair business practices with the \nprivate sector, this bill allows for FPI to search for other means to \nkeep prisoners working that do not impact the\n\n[[Page S3424]]\n\nemployment of individuals in the private sector. There is a need to \nkeep inmates busy, and this legislation addresses further work \nopportunities though public service activities and cooperation with \ncharitable organizations. Additionally, the bill recognizes the need \nfor further avenues of rehabilitation and directs the Federal Bureau of \nPrisons to establish an Enhanced In-Prison Educational and Vocational \nAssessment and Training Program for inmates.\n  I am confident that by allowing competition for government contracts \nour bill will save taxpayer dollars. Through healthy competition with \nthe private sector for procurement contracts, FPI will be forced to \nlook internally for ways to improve its own effectiveness and \nefficiency. The reform of Federal Prison Industries will bring about \nnumerous improvements, not just in cost savings, but also in preserving \njobs for law abiding Americans in the private sector who work in small \nbusinesses. And the most important effect will be the better use of tax \ndollars. The American taxpayer is the one who will benefit most from \nthis legislation.\n  A similar version of our bill was reported favorably out of the \nSenate Governmental Affairs Committee in the 108th Congress, and reform \nmeasures have passed overwhelming in the House of Representatives. Our \nbill has the support of small business groups from across the country, \nas well as organized labor. Clearly, reforming the way Federal Prison \nIndustries does business is an issue that enjoys broad, bipartisan \nsupport. I believe this bill provides that reform. I would ask my \ncolleagues to look at this legislation and consider giving it their \nsupport.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL:\n  S. 750. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nlook-through treatment of payments between related foreign \ncorporations; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the 108th Congress began the necessary \nprocess, as part of the American Jobs Creation Act, of rationalizing \nthe way the United States taxes the foreign income of U.S.-based \ncompanies, thereby helping U.S. employers to be more competitive in \ninternational markets. There was one provision, however, that passed \nboth the Senate and the House but that was dropped out of the \nconference report at the eleventh hour for reasons that were unrelated \nto the merits of the provision. That provision extended the general \nrule of tax deferral to dividends, interest, rents and royalties that \nare paid out in the ordinary course of active business activities by \none foreign affiliate of a U.S. company to another affiliate in another \ncountry. Today, I am introducing legislation to make this important \nchange.\n  The United States taxes U.S. companies on their worldwide income, but \nthe general rule is that foreign subsidiary income is not taxed by the \nUnited States until the subsidiary earnings are brought back to the \nU.S. parent, usually in the form of a dividend. Subpart F of the \nInternal Revenue Code sets forth a number of exceptions to this general \nrule. Subpart F imposes current tax on subsidiary earnings generally \nwhen that income is passive in nature. One such exception taxes the \nU.S. parent when a subsidiary receives dividends, interest, rents or \nroyalties from another subsidiary that is located in a different \ncountry. If the two subsidiaries are in the same country, however, \ncurrent taxation does not apply.\n  The proposal I am introducing today would extend this ``same-\ncountry'' treatment to payments between related foreign subsidiaries \nthat are located in different countries. This proposal is identical to \nthe one that passed the Senate last year.\n  Today's global economy is significantly different from the \nenvironment that existed when the subpart F rules were first introduced \nin 1962. As the global economy has changed, the traditional model for \noperating a global business has changed as well. In today's world, it \nmakes no sense to impose a tax penalty when a company wants to fund the \noperations of a subsidiary in one country from the active business \nearnings of a subsidiary in a second country. For example, to operate \nefficiently, a U.S.-based manufacturer will probably establish \nspecialized manufacturing sites, distribution hubs, and service \ncenters. As a result, multiple related-party entities may be required \nto fulfill a specific customer order. U.S. tax law today \ninappropriately increases the cost for these foreign subsidiaries to \nserve their customers in a very competitive business environment by \nimposing current tax on these related-party payments, even though the \nincome remains deployed in the foreign market.\n  Further, financial institutions have established foreign subsidiaries \nwith headquarters in a financial center, such as London, and branches \nin multiple countries in the same geographic region. This permits an \nefficient ``hub and spoke'' form of regional operation; however, this \nefficient business model may make it difficult for the same country \nexception under current law to be met for payments of dividends and \ninterest.\n  Under the existing rules, American companies are at a real and \nsignificant competitive disadvantage as compared to foreign-based \ncompanies. By creating current U.S. taxation of active business income \nwhen subsidiaries make cross-border payments, U.S.-based multinationals \nare penalized for responding to market or investment opportunities by \nredeploying active foreign earnings among foreign businesses conducted \nthrough multiple subsidiaries. To remove this impediment, subpart F \nshould be amended to provide a general exception for interaffiliate \npayments of dividends, interest, rents or royalties that are generated \nfrom an active business.\n  The right answer is to apply ``look-through'' treatment to payments \nof dividends, interest, rents and royalties between subsidiaries. If \nthe underlying earnings would not have been subject to subpart F, the \npayments should not be subpart F income. Look-through treatment for \npayments of dividends, interest, rents and royalties should be \npermitted as long as the payments are made out of active business, non-\nsubpart F, income. ``Look-through'' principles are already well-\ndeveloped for other purposes of the Internal Revenue Code. For example, \na look-through approach to the characterization of foreign income is \nused for purposes of calculating foreign tax credits. A consistent \napplication of look-through principles would simplify the interaction \nbetween subpart F and the foreign tax credit rules.\n  If we want to keep U.S.-based multinational companies--who employ \nmillions of workers here at home--headquartered in the United States, \nwe must modernize our tax rules so that our companies can be \ncompetitive around the globe I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this \nlegislation to make a modest change in the law that will enhance the \nposition of U.S.-based employers trying to succeed in competitive \nforeign markets.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 752.

A bill to provide for modernization and improvement of the \nCorps of Engineers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Corps of \nEngineers Modernization and Improvement Act of 2005. I am pleased to be \njoined by the senior Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, who worked with \nme in the 107th and 108th Congresses to reform the Corps.\n  We cannot ignore the record-breaking deficits that the Nation faces. \nFiscal responsibility has never been so important. This legislation \nprovides Congress with a unique opportunity to underscore our \ncommitment to that goal. Too often, some have suggested that fiscal \nresponsibility and environmental protection are mutually exclusive. \nThrough this legislation, however, we can save taxpayers billions of \ndollars and protect the environment. As evidence of this unique \nopportunity, this bill is supported by Taxpayers for Common Sense, the \nNational Taxpayers Union, the National Wildlife Federation, American \nRivers, the Corps Reform Network, and Earthjustice.\n  Reforming the Army Corps of Engineers will be a difficult task for \nCongress. It involves restoring credibility and accountability to a \nFederal agency rocked by scandals and constrained by endlessly growing \nauthorizations and a gloomy Federal fiscal picture, and yet an agency \nthat Wisconsin, and many other States across the country, have come to \nrely upon. From the Great Lakes to the mighty Mississippi, the Corps is \ninvolved in providing aid to navigation, environmental remediation, \nwater control and a variety of other services in my state alone.\n  My office has strong working relationships with the Detroit, Rock \nIsland, and St. Paul District Offices that service Wisconsin, and I \nwant the fiscal and management cloud over the Corps to dissipate so \nthat the Corps can continue to contribute to our environment and our \neconomy.\n  This legislation evolved from my experience in seeking to offer an \namendment to the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 to create \nindependent review of Army Corps of Engineers' projects. In response to \nmy initiative, the bill's managers, who included the former Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, Senator Bob Smith, and the senior Senator from \nMontana, Mr. Baucus, adopted an amendment as part of their managers' \npackage to require a National Academy of Sciences study on the issue of \npeer review of Corps projects.\n  The bill I introduce today includes many provisions that were \nincluded the bill I authored in the 108th Congress. It codifies the \nidea of independent review of the Corps, which was investigated through \nthe 2000 Water Resources bill. It also provides a mechanism to speed up \ncompletion of construction for good Corps projects with large public \nbenefits by deauthorizing low priority and economically wasteful \nprojects.\n  I will note, however, that this is not the first time that the \nCongress has realized that the Corps needs to be reformed because of \nits association with pork projects. In 1836, a House Ways and Means \nCommittee report discovered that at least 25 Corps projects were over \nbudget. In its report, the Committee noted that Congress must ensure \nthat the Corps institutes ``actual reform, in the further prosecution \nof public works.'' In 1902, Congress created a review board to \ndetermine whether Corps projects were justified. The review board was \ndismantled just over a decade ago, and the Corps is still linked with \nwasteful spending. Here we are, more than 100 years later, talking \nabout the same issue.\n  The reality is that the underlying problem is not with the Corps, the \nproblem is with Congress. All too often, Members of Congress have seen \nCorps projects as a way to bring home the bacon, rather than ensuring \nthat taxpayers get the most bang for their Federal buck.\n  This bill puts forth bold, comprehensive reform measures. It \nmodernizes the Corps project planning guidelines, which have not been \nupdated since 1983. It requires the Corps to use sound science in \nestimating the costs and evaluating the needs for water resources \nprojects. The bill clarifies that the national economic development and \nenvironmental protection are co-equal objectives of the Corps. \nFurthermore, the Corps must use current discount rates when determining \nthe costs and benefits of projects. Several Corps projects are \njustified using a discount rate formula established over 30 years ago, \nnot the current government-wide discount rate promulgated by the Office \nof Management and Budget. By using this outdated discount rate formula, \nthe Corps often overestimates project benefits and underestimates \nproject costs.\n  This legislation also requires that a water resource project's \nbenefits must be 1.5 times greater than the costs to the taxpayer. \nAccording to a 2002 study of the Corps backlog of projects, at least 60 \nCorps projects, whose combined costs total $4.6 billion, do not meet \nthis 1.5 to 1 benefit-cost ratio. Thus, this benefit-cost ratio will \nsave the taxpayer billions of dollars. The bill also mandates federal-\nlocal cost sharing of flood control projects and reduces the federal \ncost burden of these projects.\n  While the bill assumes a flat 50 percent cost-share for flood control \nprojects, my home state of Wisconsin has been on the forefront of \nresponsible flood plain management and also happens to be home to the \nAssociation of State Flood Plain Managers. As Congress considers the \nissue of Corps reform and the Water Resources Development Act, I hope \nmy colleagues will take a closer look at the issue of a sliding cost \nscale. We should explore the possibility of creating incentives for \ncommunities with cutting-edge flood plain management practices to \nreduce their local share for projects.\n  The bill requires independent review of Corps projects. The National \nAcademy of Sciences, the General Accounting Office, and even the \nInspector General of the Army agree that independent review is an \nessential step to assuring that each Corps project is economically \njustified. Independent review will apply to projects in the following \ncircumstances: 1. the project\n\n[[Page S3426]]\n\nhas costs greater than $25 million, including mitigation costs; 2. the \nGovernor of a state that is affected by the project requests a panel; \n3. the head of a federal agency charged with reviewing the project \ndetermines that the project is likely to have a significant adverse \nenvironmental or cultural impact; or 4. the Secretary of the Army \ndetermines that the project is controversial. Any party can request \nthat the Secretary make a determination of whether the project is \ncontroversial.\n  This bill also creates a Director of Independent Review within the \nOffice of the Inspector General of the Department of the Army. The \nDirector is responsible for empaneling experts to review projects. The \nSecretary is required to respond to the panel's report and explain the \nextent to which a final report addresses the panel's concerns. The \npanel report and the underlying data that the Corps uses to justify the \nproject will be made available to the public.\n  The bill also requires strong environmental protection measures. The \nCorps is required to mitigate the environmental impacts of its projects \nin a variety of ways, including by avoiding damaging wetlands in the \nfirst place and either holding other lands or constructing wetlands \nelsewhere when it cannot avoid destroying them. The Corps requires \nprivate developers to meet this standard when they construct projects \nas a condition of receiving a Federal permit, and I think the Federal \nGovernment should live up to the same standards. Too often, the Corps \ndoes not complete required mitigation and enhances environmental risks.\n  I feel very strongly that mitigation must be completed, that the true \ncosts of mitigation should be accounted for in Corps projects, and that \nthe public should be able to track the progress of mitigation projects. \nThe bill requires the Corps to develop a detailed mitigation plan for \neach water resources project, and conduct monitoring to demonstrate \nthat the mitigation is working. In addition, the concurrent mitigation \nrequirements of this bill would actually reduce the total mitigation \ncosts by ensuring the purchase of mitigation lands as soon as possible.\n  This bill streamlines the existing automatic deauthorization process. \nEstimates of the project backlog runs from $58 billion to $41 billion. \nThe bill requires the Corps to conduct a fiscal transparency report to \nreview and report on the current backlog of Corps projects. Under \ncurrent law, a project will be deauthorized anywhere from 7.5 to 11.5 \nyears after authorization for construction if it receives no funding, \nand any type of funding will keep the project alive. This bill reduces \nthe amount of time until automatic deauthorization based on funding to \nbetween 7.5 to 6.5 years. After 4 years of receiving no construction \nfunding, a project goes on the Fiscal Transparency Report list. To keep \none of those projects alive, Federal funds must be obligated for \nconstruction within 30 months of submission of the Fiscal Transparency \nReport. If no funds are obligated during that time, the project is \ndeauthorized.\n  This legislation will bring out comprehensive revision of the project \nreview and authorization procedures at the Army Corps of Engineers. My \ngoals for the Corps are to increase transparency and accountability, to \nensure fiscal responsibility, and to allow greater stakeholder \ninvolvement in their projects. I remain committed to these goals, and \nto seeing Corps Reform enacted as part of this Congress's Water \nResources bill.\n  I feel that this bill is an important step down the road to a \nreformed Corps of Engineers. This bill establishes a framework to catch \nmistakes by Corps planners, deter any potential bad behavior by Corps \nofficials to justify questionable projects, end old unjustified \nprojects, and provide planners desperately needed support against the \nnever-ending pressure of project boosters. Those boosters include \ncongressional interests, which is why I believe that this body needs to \nchampion reform--to end the perception that Corps projects are all pork \nand no substance.\n  I wish it were the case that the changes we are proposing today were \nnot needed, but unfortunately, there is still need for this bill. I \nwant to make sure that future Corps projects no longer fail to produce \npredicted benefits, stop costing the taxpayers more than the Corps \nestimated, do not have unanticipated environmental impacts, and are \nbuilt in an environmentally compatible way. This bill will help the \nCorps do a better job, which is what the taxpayers and the environment \ndeserve.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 753\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to enhance \npublic and health professional awareness and understanding of lupus and \nto strengthen the Nation's research efforts to identify the causes and \ncure of lupus; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Lupus--\nResearch, Education, Awareness, Communication, Health Care--or REACH \nAmendments of 2005. This bill will strengthen the Nation's research \nefforts to identify the causes and cure of lupus, improve lupus data \ncollection and epidemiology, and enhance public and health professional \nawareness and understanding of lupus--one of the Nation's most \ndevastating, yet least understood autoimmune diseases. It has been \nalmost 40 years since the FDA has approved a drug specifically to treat \nlupus.\n  Lupus is a life-threatening, life diminishing autoimmune disease that \ncan cause inflammation and tissue damage to virtually any organ system \nin the body, including the skin, joints, other connective tissue, blood \nand blood vessels, heart, lungs, kidney, and brain. It affects women \nnine times more often than men and 80 percent of newly diagnosed cases \nof lupus develop among women of child-bearing age.\n  This disease is not well known or well understood despite the fact \nthat according to the Lupus Foundation of America at least 1.5 to 2 \nmillion Americans live with some form of lupus. Many are either \nmisdiagnosed or not diagnosed at all. As the prototypical autoimmune \ndisease, discoveries on lupus may apply to more than 20 other \nautoimmune diseases.\n  Of serious concern is that this disease disproportionately affects \nwomen of color--it is two to three times more common among African-\nAmericans, Hispanics, Asians and Native Americans--a health disparity \nthat remains unexplained. According to the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention the rate of lupus mortality has increased since the late \n1970s and is higher among older African-American women. Comprehensive \nand definitive epidemiologic studies will help improve our \nunderstanding of these health disparities and move us toward closing \nthe gaps.\n  The symptoms of lupus make diagnosis difficult because they are \nsporadic and imitate the symptoms of many other illnesses. If diagnosed \npromptly and properly treated, the majority of lupus cases can be \ncontrolled. Unfortunately, because of the dearth of medical research on \nlupus and the length of time it takes to make a diagnosis, many lupus \npatients suffer debilitating pain and fatigue. The resulting effects \nmake it difficult, if not impossible, for these individuals to carry on \nnormal everyday activities, including work. Thousands of these \ndebilitating cases needlessly end in death each year. Our Nation must \ndo more to ensure that health professionals are aware of its signs and \nsymptoms so that people with lupus can receive the prompt, appropriate \ncare they need and deserve.\n  The Lupus REACH Amendments of 2005 seek to expand biomedical research \nand strengthen lupus epidemiology. This bill authorizes a study and \nreport by the Institute of Medicine, IOM, evaluating various Federal \nand State activities and research. This legislation will raise public \nawareness of lupus and improve health professional education. It aims \nto promote increased awareness of early intervention and treatment, \ndirect communication and education efforts, and target at-risk women \nand health professionals to help them quickly achieve a correct \ndiagnosis of lupus.\n  I would urge all my colleagues, to join me in sponsoring this \nlegislation to increase research, education, and awareness of lupus.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mr. Biden, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Durbin, \n        and Mr. Smith):\n  S. 759.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide a \nmeans for continued improvement in emergency medical services for \nchildren; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. Inouye. Mr. President, today I introduce ``The Wakefield Act,'' \nalso known as the ``Emergency Medical Services for Children Act of \n2005'' along with my colleagues Mr. Hatch, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \nDeWine, and Mr. Conrad. Since Senator Hatch and I worked toward \nauthorization of EMSC in 1984, this program has been the driving force \ntoward improving a wide range of children's emergency services. From \nspecialized training for emergency care providers to ensuring \nambulances and emergency departments have state-of-the-art pediatric-\nsized equipment, EMSC has provided the vehicle for improving survival \nof our smallest citizens when accidents or medical emergencies \nthreatened their lives.\n  It remains no secret that children present unique anatomic, \nphysiologic, emotional and developmental challenges to our primarily \nadult-oriented emergency medical system. As has been said many times \nbefore, children are not little adults. Evaluation and treatment must \ntake into account their special needs, or we risk letting them fall \nthrough the gap between\n\n[[Page S3433]]\n\nadult and pediatric care. EMSC has bridged that gap while fostering \ncollaborative relationships among emergency medical technicians, \nparamedics, nurses, emergency physicians, surgeons, and pediatricians.\n  Yet, with the increasing number of children with special healthcare \nneeds, the looming prospect of bioterrorism and the increasing \nimportance of disaster preparedness, gaps still remain in our emergency \nhealthcare delivery system for children. Re-authorization of EMSC will \nensure children's needs are given the attention and priority necessary \nto coordinate and expand services for victims of life-threatening \nillnesses and injuries.\n  I join the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of \nEmergency Physicians, the American College of Surgeons, and thirty \nother supporting healthcare organizations in celebrating the 20th \nanniversary of the EMSC program. EMSC remains the only Federal program \ndedicated to examining the best ways to deliver various forms of care \nto children in emergency settings. I look forward to re-authorization \nof this important legislation and the continued advances in our \nemergency healthcare delivery system.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 760\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) There are 31,000,000 child and adolescent visits to the \n     nation's emergency departments every year, with children \n     under the age of 3 years accounting for most of these visits.\n       (2) Ninety percent of children requiring emergency care are \n     seen in general hospitals, not in free-standing children's \n     hospitals, with one-quarter to one-third of the patients \n     being children in the typical general hospital emergency \n     department.\n       (3) Severe asthma and respiratory distress are the most \n     common emergencies for pediatric patients, representing \n     nearly one-third of all hospitalizations among children under \n     the age of 15 years, while seizures, shock, and airway \n     obstruction are other common pediatric emergencies, followed \n     by cardiac arrest and severe trauma.\n       (4) Up to 20 percent of children needing emergency care \n     have underlying medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, \n     sickle-cell disease, low birthweight, and bronchopulmonary \n     dysplasia.\n       (5) Significant gaps remain in emergency medical care \n     delivered to children, with 43 percent of hospitals lacking \n     cervical collars (used to stabilize spinal injuries) for \n     infants, less than half (47 percent) of hospitals with no \n     pediatric intensive care unit having a written transfer \n     agreement with a hospital that does have such a unit, one-\n     third of States lacking a physician available on-call 24 \n     hours a day to provide medical direction to emergency medical \n     technicians or other non-physician emergency care providers, \n     and even those States with such availability lacking full \n     State coverage.\n       (6) Providers must be educated and trained to manage \n     children's unique physical and psychological needs in \n     emergency situations, and emergency systems must be equipped \n     with the resources needed to care for this especially \n     vulnerable population.\n       (7) The Emergency Medical Services for Children (EMSC) \n     Program under section 1910 of the Public Health Service Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 300w-9) is the only Federal program that focuses \n     specifically on improving the pediatric components of \n     emergency medical care.\n       (8) The EMSC Program promotes the nationwide exchange of \n     pediatric emergency medical care knowledge and collaboration \n     by those with an interest in such care and is depended upon \n     by Federal agencies and national organizations to ensure that \n     this exchange of knowledge and collaboration takes place.\n       (9) The EMSC Program also supports a multi-institutional \n     network for research in pediatric emergency medicine, thus \n     allowing providers to rely on evidence rather than anecdotal \n     experience when treating ill or injured children.\n       (10) States are better equipped to handle occurrences of \n     critical or traumatic injury due to advances fostered by the \n     EMSC program, with--\n       (A) forty-eight States identifying and requiring all EMSC-\n     recommended pediatric equipment on Advanced Life Support \n     ambulances;\n       (B) forty-four States employing pediatric protocols for \n     medical direction;\n       (C) forty-one States utilizing pediatric guidelines for \n     acute care facility identification, ensuring that children \n     get to the right hospital in a timely manner; and\n       (D) thirty-six of the forty-two States having statewide \n     computerized data collection systems now producing reports on \n     pediatric emergency medical services using statewide data.\n       (11) Systems of care must be continually maintained, \n     updated, and improved to ensure that research is translated \n     into practice, best practices are adopted, training is \n     current, and standards and protocols are appropriate.\n       (12) Now celebrating its twentieth anniversary, the EMSC \n     Program has proven effective over two decades in driving key \n     improvements in emergency medical services to children, and \n     should continue its mission to reduce child and youth \n     morbidity and mortality by supporting improvements in the \n     quality of all emergency medical and emergency surgical care \n     children receive.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to reduce child \n     and youth morbidity and mortality by supporting improvements \n     in the quality of all emergency medical care children \n     receive.\n\n     SEC. 3. REAUTHORIZATION OF EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES FOR \n                   CHILDREN PROGRAM.\n\n       Section 1910 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n     300w-9) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``3-year period (with an \n     optional 4th year'' and inserting ``4-year period (with an \n     optional 5th year'';\n       (2) in subsection (d)--\n       (A) by striking ``and such sums'' and inserting ``such \n     sums''; and\n       (B) by inserting before the period the following: \n     ``$23,000,000 for fiscal year 2006, and such sums as may be \n     necessary for each of fiscal years 2007 through 2010'';\n       (3) by redesignating subsections (b) through (d) as \n     subsections (c) through (e), respectively; and\n       (4) by inserting after subsection (a) the following:\n       ``(b)(1) The purpose of the program established under this \n     section is to reduce child and youth morbidity and mortality \n     by supporting improvements in the quality of all emergency \n     medical care children receive, through the promotion of \n     projects focused on the expansion and improvement of such \n     services, including those in rural areas and those for \n     children with special healthcare needs. In carrying out this \n     purpose, the Secretary shall support emergency medical \n     services for children by supporting projects that--\n       ``(A) develop and present scientific evidence;\n       ``(B) promote existing and innovative technologies \n     appropriate for the care of children: or\n       ``(C) provide information on health outcomes and \n     effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.\n       ``(2) The program established under this section shall--\n       ``(A) strive to enhance the pediatric capability of \n     emergency medical service systems originally designed \n     primarily for adults; and\n       ``(B) in order to avoid duplication and ensure that Federal \n     resources are used efficiently and effectively, be \n     coordinated with all research, evaluations, and awards \n     related to emergency medical services for children undertaken \n     and supported by the Federal Government.''.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Inouye in \nintroducing ``The Wakefield Act'', which reauthorizes the Emergency \nMedical Services for Children (EMSC) program. It has been 20 years \nsince Senator Inouye and I first worked for passage of the original \nbill authorizing the EMSC program. We embarked upon this partnership \nafter realizing that there was a critical gap in our Nation's ability \nto provide emergency medical services for the most precious segment of \nour population: our children.\n  Since the Emergency Medical Services for Children Act was first \npassed, its programs have spread across the nation, enhancing the care \nreceived in the more than 31 million visits made by children and \nadolescents to our nation's emergency departments every year. In part \ndue to this program, the pediatric death rate from injuries has fallen \n40 percent over the last 20 years. Imagine that--40 percent! In that \nlight, it is extremely disappointing that President Bush would \nrecommend eliminating funding for this very important program.\n  More than 30 groups have endorsed this legislation, including the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, American College of Emergency \nPhysicians, American College of Surgeons, Brain Injury Association of \nAmerica, Emergency Nurses Association, Family Violence Prevention Fund, \nNational Association of Children's Hospitals, National Association of \nEmergency Medical Technicians, Rural Metro Corporation, Society for \nPediatric Research, and the Society of Critical Care Medicine.\n  While much has been accomplished, more remains to be done. Children's \nphysiology and response to illness and injury differ significantly from \nthose of\n\n[[Page S3434]]\n\nadults, necessitating specialized training to recognize and treat these \npatients properly. Ninety percent of the children who require emergency \ncare receive it in general hospitals, not in free-standing specialty \nchildren's hospitals. Of those hospitals that lack pediatric intensive \ncare units, only 47 percent have appropriate written transfer \nagreements with hospitals that do have such specialized units. One-\nthird of states do not have a physician available on-call 24 hours to \nprovide medical direction to EMTs or other non-physician emergency care \nproviders. Of those states that do, many do not have full state \ncoverage.\n  It is clear that despite the progress made since the Emergency \nMedical Services for Children Act was first enacted, deficiencies in \nour pediatric emergency care system remain. What is more, the need for \na strong and healthy population, as well as a robust, prepared, and \nresponsive health care system, has never been greater. This cannot \noccur in the absence of an emergency medical structure that is fully \ntrained and ready to care for our nation's youth.\n  The Wakefield Act fills this role by supporting states' efforts to \nimprove the care of children within their emergency medical services \nsystems. EMSC-supported projects include strengthening emergency care \ninfrastructures, assessing local provider needs, and developing \ncomprehensive education and training modules. The impact of this \nprogram is undeniable: in 2003, 78 percent of States reported that \neither all or some of their pediatric emergency training programs were \ndependent on EMSC grant funding.\n  The EMSC program also ensures timely distribution of best practices \nand lessons learned in the area of pediatric emergency care, as well as \nfacilitating the sharing of innovations through its national resource \ncenter. Furthermore, EMSC-supported projects have a proven record of \nsuccess at the State and local level. For example, in 1997, no State \ndisaster plan had specific pediatric components, but by 2003, 13 EMSC \nprojects were working actively with their State's disaster preparedness \noffices to address children's needs in the event of a disaster.\n  I am proud that my home State of Utah has played a vital role in \nadvancing the level of emergency medical care for children and \nteenagers. Working with the Emergency Medical Services for Children \nprogram, Utah has participated in the Intermountain Regional Emergency \nMedical Services for Children Coordinating Council. The University of \nUtah is home to both the National Emergency Medical Services for \nChildren Data Analysis Resource Center and the Central Data Management \nCoordinating Center for the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research \nNetwork. Utah-based projects also helped pioneer the development of \ntraining materials on caring for special needs pediatric patients.\n  Over the course of its 20 year history, the Emergency Medical \nServices for Children program has made great strides in improving the \nlives of our Nation's children. It has largely eliminated discrepancies \nin regulations among States, establishing a national norm and making \nchildren's issues in emergency medical care a priority. The national \nEMSC program is a dynamic and flexible program that has proved to be \nresponsive to both the Nation's and the individual States' needs. The \nprogram has funded pediatric emergency care improvement initiatives in \nevery State, territory and the District of Columbia, as well as \nnational improvement programs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important and necessary \nlegislation.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to support the introduction \nof the Wakefie1d Act, which will reauthorize the Emergency Medical \nServices for Children, EMSC, program. This program is the only Federal \nprogram that focuses specifically on improving the quality of \nchildren's emergency care. With more than 31 million child and \nadolescent visits to emergency rooms each year, the EMSC program is \nimportant to ensuring that our children receive the best trauma care \navailable.\n  As research shows, first responders cannot treat children as small \nadults, a different approach is needed. The EMSC program provides vital \nfunding to States to improve the quality of pediatric emergency care. \nEMSC funds can be used for a variety of initiatives, including for the \npurchase of child appropriate equipment and training programs for \nnurses, physicians and emergency responders. These funds fill an \nimportant need. For example, 43 percent of hospitals in this country \nlack cervical collars for infants. The EMSC program is helping to \naddress inadequacies in our Nation's EMS system.\n  This bill is particularly important to me because it is named for the \nfamily of a dear friend of mine, Mary Wakefield, who suffered a \nhorrible tragedy this past January. Mary lost her brother, Thomas \nWakefield, and two of his children, Mikal and Nicole, in a car \naccident. This terrible tragedy highlights the importance of providing \nappropriate training and equipment for children involved in trauma \ncases, and I urge all of my colleagues to cosponsor this important \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/11/senate-section/article/S3434-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 102--COMMENDING THE VIRGINIA UNION UNIVERSITY \nPANTHERS MEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM FOR WINNING THE 2005 NATIONAL COLLEGIATE \n   ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION DIVISION II NATIONAL BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mr. ALLEN (for himself and Mr. Warner) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.
