I hope we \ncan finish earlier, but if we do have votes on many of the remaining \namendments and Members insist upon that, it will be necessary to work \nlate.\n  The hearings on Judge Roberts continue today in the Judiciary \nCommittee. We have tried to accommodate that schedule with the least \nnumber of interruptions. However, we have to continue to get our work \ndone on the Senate floor on these important appropriations bills.\n  I expect we will be voting throughout the day today and, as I \nmentioned, into the evening, to finish the Commerce-Justice-Science \nmeasure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/14/senate-section/article/S9997-8", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9997-S9999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE SCOURGE OF METHAMPHETAMINE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I take a few moments to comment on one \naspect of the Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations bill. In doing \nso, I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their \nbipartisan cooperation in getting this bill done, which I believe we \ncan do by tonight. The funding in this bill is critical to the \nfunctioning of our Government, and I expect it will pass with strong \nbipartisan support.\n  Before we cast a lot more votes, I do want to call everybody's \nattention to one particular aspect of this bill that has ramifications \nthroughout each of our States that people are becoming more and more \naware of but deserves a lot more attention, and this is the \nmethamphetamine crisis that is raging all across this country.\n  As a physician, as well as a legislator, I am troubled by this \ngrowing meth crisis. As we travel across our States and look at the \ndevastation that is caused by this particular drug and the making and \nmanufacturing of this drug, we do need to act. In the last 10 years, \nmeth has become America's No. 1 drug problem--before marijuana, \ncocaine, heroin, and any other drug.\n  In Tennessee, we have been particularly hard hit. In 2004, Tennessee \nranked No. 2, tied with Iowa and behind Missouri, in the number of \nmethamphetamine lab seizures. A good friend of mine, Sandy Mattice, who \nis a U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Tennessee, describes \nmeth as ``the worst stuff that we have seen.'' And it\n\n[[Page S9998]]\n\nhas led to some of the worst, most disturbing cases of violence and \nabuse we have ever seen.\n  Last month, as I was traveling across Tennessee, I heard again and \nagain from people from all walks of life about the devastating impact \nmeth is having on the people of our State. I heard the stories about \nmeth destroying individuals' lives and families' lives, how mothers and \nfathers who are addicts abuse their children or each other during the \nhighs as well as the withdrawals from meth. We have heard again how \naddicts steal from their own parents or even their own children because \nthey are so desperate for money to buy meth.\n\n  One Tennessee case was so horrific that it made national news and \nultimately changed Tennessee law. In June of last year, authorities \nfound 3-year-old Haley Spicer at her father's mobile home in Campbell \nCounty. Haley had been burned with cigarettes and scalded with hot \nwater in a bathtub. The fumes in her meth-addicted father's meth lab \nwere so toxic that Haley's eyelids had even melted shut. Haley had to \nundergo a number of surgeries to open her eyes. She faces a lot more in \nterms of surgeries and operations to rebuild and reconstruct her nose \nand repair her ear.\n  Haley's father, Tommy Joe Owens, has been convicted on three counts \nof aggravated child abuse and one count of neglect. Owens, who claims \nto have never hurt his daughter, faces up to 60 years on each count at \na sentencing hearing next month.\n  His live-in girlfriend Charlotte Claiborne pleaded no contest to the \nsame charges and will likely be sentenced to 20 years. Haley's case was \nso disturbing that it led to swift and aggressive legislative action \nback in Tennessee. This August, the State legislature passed Haley's \nLaw which drastically toughens the child abuse penalties. This was an \nimportant victory for the youngest victims of meth, but it addresses \nthe problem after the fact, after meth has led to the violence. It is \ntime for all of us to address what we can do to prevent this meth \nabuse.\n  Haley's father should be in jail for a long time, but we have to do \nmore. Local law enforcement is crying out for our help.\n  Meth is highly addictive, and it is highly destructive as a \nsubstance. Users experience a powerful boost, described as more \npowerful than any other drug, three times the intensity of cocaine. The \nhigh lasts for longer, up to 8 hours. Users take hit after hit on \nsleepless binges that can last up to 2 and sometimes even 3 weeks. Once \nsucked in, many users find it impossible to climb out.\n  Take, for example, Lynn Noland, also of Tennessee. Lynn did not plan \non becoming an addict, nor for that matter did she plan on becoming \nwhat she did, a drug dealer. It started 4 years ago when Lynn was a 36-\nyear-old marketing executive and she tried her first hit. One hit \nbecame an addiction and she quit her well-paying job and started \ntrading meth ingredients to support her habit.\n  She would disguise herself as a farmer, put on overalls and put on a \nball cap and stop by the co-op to be able to purchase ingredients \nundetected in an unsuspecting way.\n  Another dangerous aspect of meth is it can be cooked anywhere with \nstore-bought ingredients. So it is very mobile. It is easy to make and \nit is hard to detect where it is made. Lynn started cooking the drug \nherself in caves, as she describes it, and in little sheds.\n  ``I could not live without meth,'' she said. ``I could not lift my \nhead off the pillow to brush my teeth without it.''\n  Eventually, Lynn was arrested. She lost custody of her children and \nended up in a halfway house. Lynn was lucky. She was able to kick her \nhabit. Most addicts need repeated episodes of rehabilitation. Many \nnever succeed and many never survive. They die of severe burns from lab \nexplosions. Some commit suicide. Some are killed by a spouse who is \nalso addicted.\n  Meth leads to depression; it leads to psychosis; it leads to skin \ninfections; it leads to high blood pressure; it leads to hepatitis C; \nit leads to kidney damage; it leads to severe tooth decay, to name a \nfew. The list goes on. The greatest health risk of meth is the impact \nit has on the brain. It rewires the brain. Methamphetamine produces a \nhuge rush of a chemical called dopamine in the brain, and that results \nin a huge surge, a euphoria that results from this increase in dopamine \ntransmission.\n  Over time, however, this excess of dopamine destroys the \ntransmission, the neurological linkage system, within the brain, and \nusers experience an inability to have emotions or pleasure without more \namphetamine coming into the system all the time. Eventually, in a \npattern similar to Parkinson's disease, there are no terminals there--\nthey are destroyed--which can release dopamine and users experience \nprolonged and often permanent depression.\n  Thus, the personal cost is staggering. The cost to the community at \nlarge is staggering. An estimated 12 million Americans have tried \nmethamphetamine. It is estimated that about 1.5 million people are \nregular users. In many areas of the country, the medical costs for \ncounty jails have doubled because of meth. Last month, a colleague of \nmine at Vanderbilt, Dr. Jeffrey Guy, who is director of Vanderbilt \nMedical Center's burn unit, which is in Nashville, told Newsweek: I do \nnot know if we will have a burn unit 5 to 10 years from now if \nVanderbilt continues to take on the large burden of $5 million to $10 \nmillion per year in uncompensated care for patients burned in meth lab \nexplosions.\n  Doctors estimate that treating burn victims exceeds about $10,000 a \nday per patient, most of whom do not have health insurance. Meth abuse \noften leads to violent crimes, including domestic violence, assaults, \nrobberies, and burglaries. Local law enforcement is finding itself \noverwhelmed. Most rural police departments do not have the resources to \ndeal with all of the problems brought forward by meth to deal with the \nlab explosions, the expensive toxic waste cleanup required when one \ngoes in and removes these labs. Each pound of methamphetamine leaves \nbehind 5 to 6 pounds of this toxic waste, and the cleanup involves \ndangerous exposure to our law enforcement officers engaged in removal \nof these labs.\n  A very effective way to stop the meth crisis is to restrict the \ningredients that make up meth and to restrict it all across the country \nin all 50 States. Jerry Estes, a district attorney general in \nTennessee, has seen a dramatic reduction in meth lab seizures since our \nState, Tennessee, passed the bill restricting access to cold medicines \nthat serve as the ingredients for the manufacture of meth. North \nCarolina, however, has not adopted similar legislation. As a result, \nwhat has been found, at least in southeast Tennessee, is that people \nwill simply cross the border to buy those ingredients and bring them \nback home. Thus, we need a uniform policy across this country.\n\n  Jerry tells me the single greatest impact we could have on reducing \nmeth abuse is requiring all 50 States to restrict access to \npseudoephedrine. That is what the Combat Meth Act does. It requires \nStates to restrict access to all cold medicines containing meth \nprecursors so that meth producers simply cannot shop and cruise from \nState to State.\n  In closing, I thank Senators Talent and Feinstein for taking the lead \non this issue and for their hard work in getting the Combat Meth Act \nadopted as part of the appropriations process. The Combat Meth Act is a \ncritical first step to defeating this ongoing crisis. I urge my \ncolleagues to follow this issue very closely because this is not going \nto be the end of it. This is the No. 1 drug problem facing the people \nof our States today. We will be talking about it a lot more in the \ncoming days and weeks. Meth is destroying individuals, it is destroying \nfamilies, and it is destroying communities. We cannot tolerate that. \nAmerica needs to put a stop to this growing health and moral crisis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The majority leader, my colleague from Tennessee, speaks \nof methamphetamine. It is an enormous problem in this country, \nespecially in rural States. I certainly appreciate the comments he has \nmade today. It is something on which we must provide enormous focus. It \nis destroying lives. It is one of the most highly addictive drugs we \nknow. You can cook methamphetamine virtually anywhere--an abandoned \nfarmhouse.\n\n[[Page S9999]]\n\nYou can buy the products from which you make methamphetamine, in many \nStates, across the counter. This is a deadly drug causing havoc for so \nmany people.\n  If you talk to law enforcement people about dealing with \nmethamphetamine, they will tell you that when they arrest someone \ninvolved in methamphetamine, they don't quite know what they are going \nto get. These are people who can become the most enormously violent \npeople in the world, or they can be passive. You don't quite know what \nyou are going to find, what you are going to get. It contributes to \nsubstantial crime and destroys lives. I appreciate the comments of my \ncolleague, the majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/14/senate-section/article/S9999-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to make a brief \nstatement on something I know the majority leader and also the \nDemocratic leader, Senator Reid, have been speaking about in recent \ndays, and that is the issue of the creation of an independent \ncommission to evaluate exactly what kind of preparedness exists in this \ncountry and to evaluate this country's response to a natural disaster \nor to a terrorist attack.\n  It is important, it seems to me, in this case, to stare truth in the \neye. We don't do that with fiscal policy. We don't stare truth in the \neye with respect to trade policy. Both have the highest deficits in the \nhistory of the country at this point. There are many areas where we try \nto ignore what is going on, and we do so successfully, regrettably, \nmuch to the detriment of the future of this country. The question of \nwhat we do with disaster relief and disaster preparedness, preparedness \nto try to deal with a terrorist attack, is a different issue.\n  I noticed today in the newspapers and on television, the folks in New \nOrleans are beginning to clean up. Even as there remains the search for \nbodies and survivors, and so on, there are folks out sweeping the \nsidewalks in front of businesses, those businesses that have not been \ninundated with water. There are folks hauling away trash. There is a \nresiliency, a spirit that is irrepressible. Already people are starting \nto talk about their future, to clean up. So must we. So must we clean \nup and begin to repair.\n  None of this discussion should ever be about Republicans or \nDemocrats. It is about success or failure. All of us looking truth in \nthe eye must understand that the response by this country to what \nhappened in the Gulf was a failure. Whose failure? I don't know. \nPerhaps the failure of all of us: Congress, the President, State and \nlocal officials--perhaps all of us. But I believe we ought to get to \nthe bottom of it and evaluate how we change that which failed so \nmiserably.\n  When you wake up this morning to the news that 34 people were left to \ndie in a nursing home--yes, in the United States of America 34 people \nwere left to die in a nursing home at the advent of an oncoming \nhurricane and breached dike and flood--you ask the question, Is this \nreally the United States? What on Earth could have happened? We need to \nfind out.\n\n  I know some of the Members of Congress have talked about creating a \nspecial committee in Congress to look at it. All right. It doesn't \nsubstitute for an independent commission, in my judgment. The President \ntalked about his investigation, and, that is fine. What we need, most \nof all--what we did with respect to 9/11 is an independent commission \nwith the kind of authority and power to get to the bottom of what \nhappened. Why? Because if we do not fix what went wrong and make it \nright, we will remain unprepared in the advent of a terrorist attack or \nanother natural disaster.\n  This was, we think, the worst natural disaster in this country's \nhistory. It can happen again. But we know terrorists will want to \ncommit a terrorist attack in this country. We know there are thousands \nof nuclear weapons that exist in this world. We know there are people \nworried about terrorists acquiring a nuclear weapon, detonating it in a \ntrunk in a rusty Yugo sitting on a dock in one of America's major \ncities. What kind of response, what kind of disaster preparedness \nexists to deal with a terrorist attack?\n  I know why there are some who do not like independent commissions: \nyou can't control them. You can't control information. You can't \ncontrol direction. You lose control with an independent commission.\n  But we need an independent commission to investigate exactly what has \nhappened, what went wrong at all levels, and try to evaluate how we put \ntogether a process that really does work, that represents the best of \nthis country.\n  We know this country works. It has great ingenuity, great capability, \nbut something happened that went wrong in a very significant way. This \nwas a mess. It is not about blame, it is about accountability. Who is \naccountable? How are they accountable? How do we make them accountable?\n  So I believe we have a desperate need at this point to move quickly \nto put together an independent commission that can begin putting the \npieces together. Even as the folks in New Orleans begin putting their \ncity back together and cleaning up, so, too, should the President and \nCongress begin putting this together and cleaning up and evaluating it \nthrough the best work of some of the best minds in our country, some of \nthe best people we can call on to serve on an independent commission to \nevaluate and investigate what went wrong and how do we, as a country, \nfix it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/14/senate-section/article/S9999-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9999-S10002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ENERGY COSTS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there is one additional point I would like \nto make on legislation I have introduced. I notice the Energy \nInformation Administration just released its short-term outlook. They \nforecast dramatic increases for residential energy costs this upcoming \nwinter.\n  I come from North Dakota. We don't exactly have balmy weather in \nFebruary and January, the middle of winter. We can sometimes have some \npretty tough winters. It is a great State, but we have some tough \nwinters. The ranges for heating fuel expenditures for natural gas in \nthe Midwest, according to the EIA, are 69 to 70 percent increases in \nthe winter in the Midwest.\n  We have a lot of folks who are going to have a devil of a time trying \nto pay these costs. I made the point before, and I know there are \npeople in this Chamber who chafe at this, that the major integrated oil \ncompanies have gotten larger through mergers. They are much more \npowerful. They have the capability, working with others, to determine \nwhat happens in pricing and supply. We have OPEC people sitting around \na table talking about pricing supplies. Then we have a futures market \nwhich is supposed to provide liquidity--which it does, but it provides \nmuch more than that nowadays. It is rampant speculation in spot \nmarkets. The result of that is the highest prices we have seen in this \ncountry.\n  Last year, the price of oil was $34.50 a barrel--January 31, 2004. At \nthat price the oil companies are making record profits. Now it is $30 \nabove that. That is $7 billion a month in extra profit, $80 billion on \na yearly basis of extra profit. That, in my judgment, is unfair. \nFlowing through it is a 70-percent increase in natural gas prices to \nthose trying to heat their homes, or flowing through the gas pump where \nyou put in 15 gallons and pay $52. That is unfair. I think there ought \nto be a windfall profits tax recapturing that windfall and using it in \nrebates to consumers. I don't begrudge anyone a fair profit, but this \nis not a fair market and I believe Congress should take some action. \nThis issue existed long before Hurricane Katrina formed and hit this \ncountry, and I believe it behooves this Congress to address these \nissues, especially before we go into the winter heating season and the \nfolks, particularly in the northern Great Plains and other States, are \ngoing to pay 70 percent increases--in some cases a price they simply \ncannot afford to pay for something as basic as heating their homes.\n  This Congress needs to act. I hope one of the actions will be to \nconsider the legislation I have introduced.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S10000]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is difficult to find words adequate \nenough to express the emotions of so many Americans, all across the \ncountry, as we continue to learn more about the utter devastation of \nthe Gulf Coast region by Hurricane Katrina.\n  Hundreds of lives have been lost. Thousands more have been ripped \napart, as Gulf Coast residents have lost their homes, savings, or \npossessions. A great American city, New Orleans, has been reduced to a \nghost town. In the months ahead we will have much rebuilding to do--\nalthough there is no doubt in my mind that the gulf coast will be \nrebuilt, and rebuilt stronger than ever before.\n  We have already made great progress towards assisting the Gulf region \nhere in the Senate. In the last several days we have passed over $62 \nbillion in emergency relief. These funds are flowing to the people who \nmost need help as we speak.\n  The majority leader is working to clear a measure that would \naccelerate billions of dollars of payments to states under the \nTemporary Assistance to Needy Families, or TANF, program. The House \npassed it by voice vote last week, and we ought to do the same.\n  This kind of important action is by no means found only in the United \nStates Congress. In this time of crisis, it has been inspiring to see \nso many millions of Americans moving quickly to help in their fellow \nAmericans' hour of need.\n  Individual citizens are making a difference. I would like to share \nwith my colleagues an inspiring story about a group of officers from \nthe Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources. Twenty-three \nofficers, most of whom did not know each other when they set out, took \n12 boats to New Orleans and scoured the flooded neighborhoods to rescue \nover 200 people.\n  The men who volunteered for this mission came from all over \nKentucky--towns like Somerset, Paris, Mount Vernon, and Pippa Passes. \nThey spent 3 days in New Orleans, searching flooded houses, rescuing \nsurvivors, and bringing food and water to many.\n  Led by Captain Clark Boggs of Philpot and Captain Frank Floyd of \nBedford, these men risked their health and safety for those they did \nnot know. On the first day, they heard gunshots ring out near them. The \ntoxic water they steered their boat through was a breeding ground for \nwho knows how many diseases. Some of the men still bear scars and \nrashes from their mission.\n  But they returned to Kentucky with happier mementoes as well--Mardi \nGras beads, given as tokens of thanks by New Orleans residents grateful \nthat they had been rescued. When they spent their nights at a local \nchurch, or took refuge in a school, appreciative locals brought them \nhot plates of Cajun food. Most importantly, they will never forget the \nlooks of relief on the faces of the people they rescued, people who \nthought they had been forgotten.\n  Let me also speak about a group of Kentucky doctors and nurses who \nflew down to the vicinity of New Orleans to provide emergency medical \nservices. When they arrived, they found two gymnasiums full of people \nrequiring medical attention. They assisted in setting up an emergency \nshelter that has to date treated over 7,000 patients.\n  One of the nurses, Addia Wuchner of Florence, KY, is also a state \nrepresentative. She spent seven days helping the people of New Orleans \nand told my staff about her experiences there.\n  One of the hardest parts of her job was to tell the people she was \ntreating, who had not been watching the news and had no idea of the \ndevastation to New Orleans, that their homes were most likely flooded \nand unsalvageable. She also had the much more pleasant opportunity to \nreunite a grandfather and a granddaughter.\n  St. Elizabeth Medical Center in Edgewood, KY, donated the medical \nsupplies that the team brought with them. And St. Elizabeth Medical \nCenter is holding several fundraising drives and collecting employee \ndonations, to continue to aid the people of the Gulf Coast region. The \ngroup's airfare was paid for by a local Kentucky businessman named Bill \nButler, who graciously stepped in when the medical team was unsure \nwhether they would be able to afford to fly down to help.\n  Let me share another story. Once upon a time, before Katrina, Charity \nHospital in New Orleans helped the Pikeville Medical Center, in \nPikeville, KY, set up a drug detoxification program. So when New \nOrleans needed help, the Pikeville Medical Center responded. A nurse \nnamed Cheryl Hickman rounded up other volunteers willing to travel down \nto the Gulf Coast area, and within hours a team of nurses and EMS \npersonnel were on the road, driving ambulances stocked full of medical \nsupplies.\n  Stories like these, stories of generosity and charity, are so \nnumerous in Kentucky that I could tell you many more. Churches, rotary \nclubs, and charitable organizations throughout the Commonwealth have \nraised hundreds of thousands of dollars. Even two little girls in my \nhometown of Louisville, KY, 12-year-old Briana O'Holleran and 11-year-\nold Amy Williams, raised $60 by setting up a lemonade stand.\n  Kentucky employers are also making a difference. Humana Inc., a \nhealth care company based in Louisville, KY, has donated $1 million to \nrelief efforts--half of that to the Red Cross, and half to local relief \nagencies in the Gulf Coast who are able to use the money for food, \nclean water and other supplies and get it to the people who most need \nit.\n  UPS, a major employer in Louisville, has donated $1.25 million to \nseveral different agencies. Also, since they are of course a shipping \ncompany, they have provided transportation services for relief \nagencies, and have hauled bottled water into Mississippi for evacuees.\n  General Electric, which has its appliances division based in \nLouisville, has donated $6 million to the Red Cross, and their \nemployees have raised another $1 million which will be matched by the \ncompany. They are also working to donate $10 million worth of \ngenerators and equipment to aid relief workers.\n  And I am sure that all of my colleagues could stand up and tell us of \nsimilar stories from their states. Kentucky is not unique when it comes \nto the outpouring of such goodwill. By sharing these stories, I hope I \nhave reminded my colleagues that the compassion of ordinary, everyday \nAmericans is a stronger force than the winds of any hurricane.\n  So, Mr. President, as we continue our vital work here in the Senate \nto get the Gulf Coast region back up on its feet again, I hope we will \nbe guided by the giving spirit of the Kentuckians I have mentioned. \nJust as they, and so many others, are working tirelessly to restore \nhope and mend broken lives, so should we.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise to express sympathy to all those \nimpacted by the disaster of Hurricane Katrina.\n  Each of us, in our own way, reaches out to Senator Vitter and Senator \nLandrieu, Senator Lott, Senator Cochran, Senator Sessions and Senator \nShelby, whose States have been ravaged by a natural disaster, frankly, \nbeyond calculation and beyond the plans and the very best intentions of \nthose on the ground. It is a fact that sometimes nature is bigger than \nwe are. Katrina is evidence of one of those occasions.\n  It has been disappointing that there has been a rush to play politics \nwith a natural disaster. There has been an excess of finger-pointing \nand faultfinding. I note that President Bush yesterday bravely said \nthat if you need to blame someone, blame him. I don't believe the blame \nbelongs with him, but he recognizes his role in leadership. I salute \nhim for his courage in simply trying to find the solutions and not \nspending wasted effort pointing fingers and placing blame.\n  I represent a State that has known its share of natural disasters--\nvolcanos, wildfires, and a tsunami several decades ago. While Oregon is \na long way from the Gulf Coast, we have been near in the relief effort \nand helping in recovery. I rise today to let the Senate know how proud \nI am of the response from my home State of Oregon. Oregonians have big \nhearts. With their trademark of selflessness and generosity, they have \nresponded in a wide number of ways to help our friends in the South.\n\n[[Page S10001]]\n\n  The Oregon Trail Chapter of the Red Cross has a national reputation \nfor being one of the first chapters to call when experienced volunteers \nare needed to respond to disasters. Since the hurricane hit, the Oregon \nRed Cross volunteers have been working around the clock to help the \nrelief effort. The chapter worked quickly to set up an emergency \nevacuation center in Oregon should one be needed to house evacuees. It \nwas made available. It was offered repeatedly, but it has not been \nnecessary.\n  The chapter this week is also holding a massive instructional program \nwith the goal of training 1,000 Oregonians on disaster preparedness.\n  Volunteers from the Portland-based Northwest Medical Teams are also \nplaying an important role in helping with medical relief efforts and \nshipping emergency supplies. Workers from Northwest Medical Teams are \ncurrently in the Gulf Coast region responding with critically needed \nmedical care, supplies, and logistical support.\n  Mercy Corps, a humanitarian relief agency based in Portland, was one \nof the first groups on the ground providing emergency assistance. The \nCorps' response team will grow in the coming weeks as local residents \nare hired to aid in recovery efforts. Both Mercy Corps and Northwest \nMedical Teams were also among the first to rush to aid the victims of \nthe December 2004 tsunami in Southeast Asia.\n  I want to acknowledge the efforts of the Cascade Division of the \nSalvation Army. These volunteers have been working overtime, collecting \ndonations that will go to help in the Katrina recovery.\n  The outpouring of contributions from Oregonians has been \noverwhelming. I thank all of the communities, both large and small--the \ncivic organizations, the high school football teams, and the campus \ngroups that have worked to organize fundraising drives.\n  I give a special thanks to more than 1,900 Oregon National Guard \ntroops who at the request of our Governor, Ted Kulongoski, were \nmobilized to help the people of the hurricane-ravaged region.\n  For nearly 10 days now, members of the Oregon Guard have been on the \nground in New Orleans clearing roads, assessing critical needs, \nconducting rescue operations and providing security patrols.\n  The Oregon Guard troops are part of a force of 72,000 Active-Duty and \nNational Guard personnel who are on the ground and aboard ships \nsupporting relief operations. Since the hurricane struck, our military \nmen and women have been working night and day providing search and \nrescue, evacuation, and medical support. Through yesterday, over 10,000 \nsorties have been flown.\n\n  On the national level, the U.S. Coast Guard has also been working \ntirelessly to support relief efforts. As of this weekend, the Coast \nGuard has assisted in saving or evacuating over 35,000 people.\n  Personnel from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have been working \naround the clock to repair the breached levees, restore navigation, and \npump water out of New Orleans and surrounding parishes.\n  In recent years we have asked a great deal from our men and women in \nthe military, and time and again they have responded heroically, \npatriotically, and with professionalism.\n  In addition, the U.S. Forest Service has deployed more than 2,700 \nemployees who are trained in rescue and response to this area. These \nteams have been putting their skills to use setting up logistics \nstaging areas, distributing food products, and removing debris.\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture has also been working to get food \nto the area and provide housing for displaced people. USDA has \ndelivered more than 300 trucks containing over 12 million pounds of \nfood and baby food and formula products.\n  The USDA's Rural Development Service has established an expedited \nprocess to move people into safe and secure housing. Its property \nmanagers are assisting families by providing them with information on \nhow to access additional Government programs and services to assist \nthem, such as food stamp benefits.\n  As we work to recover and rebuild from Hurricane Katrina, there will \ncertainly be many trying days ahead. However, I believe we can find \ncomfort in the heartening response of the American people. In \nparticular, I salute the people of Oregon. There are numerous examples \nof goodness, strength, and compassion as people have reached out to \nhelp friends, neighbors, and strangers in need.\n  I salute those of my state and those of other states who are going \nthe extra mile to help their fellow Americans through this terrible \ndisaster. I want to suggest again that our best efforts should go to \nsupporting those on the ground who are working to restore the \nhurricane-ravaged areas, and we should keep to a minimum the \npartisanship and the finger pointing that has broken out so \nunfortunately and unproductively in recent days.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on our \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 13\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask that I be notified when I have \nused 7 minutes so my colleague from Wyoming can have the remaining 6 \nminutes of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It will be done.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, over the past few weekends I have visited several \nhurricane relief centers in Texas. I started at the Astrodome in \nHouston, which was gearing up for the people who were coming from \nLouisiana at the time. I was struck by the number of volunteers, the \norganization of the effort in Houston, as well as the response of the \nmedical community.\n  There were medical facilities in place. Even complicated medical \nprocedures were ongoing at places such as M.D. Anderson, where doctors \nwould take patients who had been in the middle of chemotherapy and try \nto continue that chemotherapy so those patients would not lose any of \nthe efforts that were being made on their behalf in Louisiana. Doctors \nat M.D. Anderson were even continuing bone marrow transplants that were \nin progress.\n  Baylor College of Medicine was setting up the facilities for the \nevacuees who were arriving. There were medical units that had the \ncooperation of all the hospitals in Houston. It was truly a remarkable \nsight.\n  The next weekend, I was able to go to the Convention Center in Dallas \nand see the medical operation there that was put together by the head \nof the emergency physicians at the University of Texas Southwestern \nMedical School and Parkland Hospital. They had gotten all of the \nhospitals in Dallas together to provide mental health services, \nemergency services, and any kind of services for sick children. Also, \nthey were dispensing medicine on an as-needed basis in the Dallas \nConvention Center.\n  Last weekend, I was able to go to Austin to see the emergency team \nthat brought together the emergency personnel for the State of Texas--\nthe Department of Public Safety, the Texas Guard and Reserve units--\nthat were being helpful, including the Red Cross and the Salvation \nArmy, two great volunteer organizations that have stepped right in to \nhelp. In some of these centers, they were the first people to start \nsetting up the centers.\n  Then, I went to the Austin Convention Center, where they even had set \nup a beauty shop for the evacuees who wanted, of course, to try to look \ntheir best as they were trying to get their lives together and \ndetermine what they were going to do until they are able to return to \nNew Orleans or other places in Louisiana.\n  We have seen many of the emergency facilities, even though, of \ncourse, Texas was not in this storm. But Texas has had an emergency \ncrisis of its own; and that is in the education that is now being \nrequired for the children coming into the school systems, as well as \ntrying to get help for the ongoing medical needs that will be required \nfor approximately 250,000 evacuees from Louisiana, a few from \nMississippi, and trying to make sure these costs are covered by the \nFederal Government.\n  While Texans have opened their hearts and their homes and their \nschools, we do not think they should have to fund all of this from \nState coffers or local coffers because, frankly,\n\n[[Page S10002]]\n\nthe local schools are already very strapped for funds and they cannot \nafford this expense.\n  Likewise, the cities are not able to afford the overtime expenses of \nall the police who are being required and the firemen who are doing the \nemergency medical services. So I am working on legislation right now \nthat would try to get money into these entities that do not have the \ncash flow to accept all of these people on an emergency basis, and to \ndo it on an expedited basis here in Congress.\n  There are, at this time, between 30,000 and 40,000 new students \ncoming into the Texas school systems. This is a huge increase in a very \nshort time. Trying to match the students with the kind of curriculum \nthat has been ongoing in the Texas schools is a challenge. Texas is \ntrying to meet that challenge in the best way for all concerned.\n  I am hoping Congress will act very quickly to alleviate some of these \nearly problems in getting the funding where it needs to be. For \ninstance, there is no FEMA money for education expenses. So the bill I \nhope we could pass this week will allow FEMA, through the Department of \nEducation, to immediately start reimbursing the schools for the costs \nof opening these new schools and the temporary facilities that are \nbeing required, including the schoolbooks and school supplies that are \nbeing required to help these new students, who are already entering 2 \nweeks late because Texas schools start the last week of August, \nsometimes the third week in August.\n  We need to bring these children in and get them going in an expedited \nway. I am asking my colleagues to help me pass, on a quick basis, an \nability for FEMA to fund education expenses and to waive some laws that \nwill allow them to be placed where they can best be placed without \nregard to the McKinney Act, just for a temporary time.\n  This legislation will sunset at the end of this school year, so it \nwill not be permanent. I hope we can pass it on an expedited basis to \ntry to meet the needs of these students and my State, which has been so \ngenerous and has offered so much help to these people, which we want to \ncontinue to do and we will continue to do. But I want the Federal \nGovernment to make it easier on these governmental agencies regarding \nthe expenses incurred by the communities that are doing so much.\n  We want this to be the model for response to future emergencies, not \none where other States look at what has happened in our State and say: \nWell, if the Federal Government is not going to step up on education \nexpenses and medical care, then it will be difficult to take in future \nemergency victims. So that is what we are trying to do.\n  Our hearts go out to all of the people who are affected by this \ndisaster. We are going to do our part. I am hoping Congress will act \nsoon to help us do the right thing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has now used 7 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield the floor to my colleague from \nWyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Texas for the \ntime.\n  I join all of us in expressing our condolences and our concerns for \nwhat has happened in the New Orleans area. Certainly Senator Vitter's \ndiscussions yesterday helped us understand a little better what the \nsituation is there, what the difficulties are, and what our \nresponsibilities are to do something about that as quickly as we \npossibly can.\n  We certainly first want to again offer our condolences to the \nfamilies of those who perished. I support those who continue to live in \nthe hurricane-affected areas.\n  What we have seen is, obviously, one of the most terrible natural \ndisasters in our Nation's history. We have also seen, fortunately, the \ngenerous spirit of our Nation thrive in a time of confusion and loss. \nThe giving nature of the American people has been displayed and \ncontinues to be displayed. We should be very proud of that.\n  I am especially impressed with the people of Wyoming who have opened \ntheir hearts and their homes to help the hurricane victims. You never \nknow when someone is going to be in the path of a similar storm.\n  The objective now, of course, is to get the victims back on their \nfeet, and to provide for their basic needs, to bring some semblance of \nnormalcy to the situation there. This is going to be an ongoing effort. \nIt is going to be ongoing, but it also demands immediate attention. \nProgress is being made hour by hour, day by day. I think it is a \ntestament to the courage of the people throughout the Gulf Coast. It \nwill take years to rebuild New Orleans and the other areas, but I am \nconfident there will be a thriving economy again in that area.\n  Over the next few weeks, our Nation will show, once again, why we are \nthe envy of the world. We will prove that no matter what the obstacles \nare that are before us, we can join together to overcome them, even if \nit is Mother Nature. The stories of heroism and fortitude will continue \nto trickle down, but soon, like the water that has destroyed so much, \nthat trickle was evolve into a wave--a wave of construction, a wave of \nrebirth.\n  As we showed on that bright September morning 4 years ago, this \nNation will rise out of the ashes and rebuild the Gulf Coast. I join my \nWyomingites to say we are sorry for what happened, but we look forward \nto working with you to restore what you have lost.\n  I am particularly proud of Wyoming's military. We have deployed 72 \npeople in support of Hurricane Katrina relief efforts. We have sent \nfour helicopters with 19 people, two C-130s delivering equipment. We \nhave sent AirVac nurses and 13 security police from the naval air \nstation. So we are very pleased to be able to help. We need to provide \nthe help.\n  There are lots of things being talked about. We can talk about tax \nrelief, particularly as it provides relief for those things being given \nthere. TANF, of course, has something to do with education and health \ncare. We can do something about insurance, private insurance, to make \nthat more efficient. Charitable giving is one of the things we can look \nat to ensure that is as useful as can be. School funding, which has \nalready been mentioned here, is very important, whether it be there or \nwherever the children are. Medicaid is one area we need to take a \nstrong look at to make sure it is available to everyone who needs \nit. Certainly, we need to take a look at emergency funding.\n\n  There are many items with which we are challenged. They are going to \nbe difficult, but they are there. We can accomplish what we need to do, \nand that is to help these people in this circumstance. As we do it, \nhowever, I hope we remember that, as in the case of our family, when we \nhave emergency needs, we have to look at some other areas to cut back a \nlittle bit. As this emergency continues to go on, our life needs to go \non. Government needs to go on with its essential services. At the same \ntime, there are some things we are doing in the Government that could \nbe set aside and could, indeed, be changed so that we can offset some \nof the costs that go into this effort. That will be necessary.\n  I send our condolences and accept and join with my associates to take \non the challenge of dealing with the needs of the people in the Gulf \nCoast.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/14/senate-section/article/S10002-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator is correct.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield her such time as she may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1687, as Modified\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my esteemed colleagues for their \nleadership on this legislation.\n  We will have an opportunity in a few moments to make sure that we are \nsolving the problem that everyone says is the biggest in terms of \nsystem failure related to the hurricane in the Gulf. We heard the same \nthing after 9/11. The radios didn't work. The communications didn't \nwork. Police and firefighters were running into buildings that they \nshould have been running out of, but they didn't know what was \nhappening above them. We knew that after 9/11. The 9/11 Commission \nreiterated that. We have talked about it. It is now time to do \nsomething about it.\n  I join with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in reaching out \nto those who have been hurt, who have suffered, who lost everything, \nthe families of those who have lost their lives. As the majority leader \nsaid, coming back from the Gulf, he was astounded at the lack of \ncommunication. We can fix this. My amendment would begin that process.\n  We know, from the Congressional Budget Office, it will take at least \n$15 billion to connect local, State and Federal officials so that we \nhave the redundancy, the backup, the connectedness to make sure we are \nresponding quickly, effectively, that we know what is going on, on the \nground, and everybody can get the job done to save lives, save \nproperty, and protect the American people.\n  My amendment would allocate that first piece. I offered it on the \nHomeland Security bill this year. It was not supported. Now is the time \nto support it and get it done. It offers $5 billion with the \nexpectation we would come back and do the second payment next year and \nthe third payment the year after. I know that my colleague who worked \non the Homeland Security bill and led that effort is going to say: We \nalready have moneys for that kind of thing, and the locals don't spend \nit in the right way. According to the Web site of the Department of \nHomeland Security, the Federal Government has spent only $280 million \ndirectly on connectedness, interoperability, and communications.\n  We could say to folks: Your COPS funding is getting cut, your \ntraining programs are getting cut, everything else is getting cut so \nyou have fewer people on the ground. We want you to put the money into \nonly communications.\n  That is not reality. In Michigan, we have 1,200 fewer police officers \non the streets today than we did on 9/11/2001. That is not acceptable. \nMy local police and firefighters are trying to hold on and keep the \nstaff, keep the equipment they need. It is unrealistic and \nirresponsible on our part to say somehow each local police department \nand fire department, each county and city are going to pay for this \ninteroperability that needs to happen so they can talk to the State and \nto Homeland Security, talk to the Justice Department and FEMA, with \nwhomever they need to talk.\n  Our country was attacked. After 9/11, the Federal Government has the \nresponsibility to protect our citizens and respond. After this \nhurricane, again, we know that it is a broader, regional, national \nresponse that is needed. People are looking to the Federal Government \nfor help, and part of that help long term has got to be investing in \nprotecting our citizens by making sure the communications systems work. \nI can't imagine we would send our brave men and women into battle \noverseas and not make sure the radios work and are connected. Why would \nwe send our people here at home, our brave troops, our firefighters, \nour police officers, emergency responders, nurses, doctors, into harm's \nway in the middle of a disaster and not make sure the communications \nwork?\n  We are in an age of technology. There is no excuse. I understand \nthere are a number of new technologies that involve Web-based systems \nand new kinds of interoperability that we can bring to bear to get this \ndone. When I think about what we need to be doing in the aftermath--\nfirst, helping those who have lost so much; second, making sure the \nFederal bureaucracy doesn't victimize folks again and supporting States \nthat are reaching out--it is our responsibility to make sure that the \nsystems that failed do not fail again. Time is up. No more talk about \nmoving one line item to another line item or this or that. I know we \nwill hear that they have already received money that hasn't been spent. \nIf it has not gotten through the Federal bureaucracy, what the heck is \ngoing on? Let's get it moving.\n  I know my folks on the frontlines are happy to accept funds and happy \nto do what they need to do to get this radio equipment working so they \nprotect themselves and their communities. If the bureaucracy is not \nworking fast enough, let's make it work. If the resources aren't there \nto make sure our people are protected, let's make sure the resources \nare there. That is our job. The American people are looking at us and \nsaying: This is America. What is going on? Why didn't we collectively \nhave the foresight to make sure that systems worked, that we have a \nnational system? As Senator Blanche Lincoln talked about yesterday, \nwhen the Red Cross was putting in all of this data on victims to help, \nthen FEMA comes in and has to do it again because it is not \ninteroperable. Local communities cannot do this alone. States cannot do \nit alone. I hope my colleagues will step up and send a signal that we \nget it. We are going to fix it and do our part to make sure our \ncitizens are safe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to respond on this amendment. I want \nto make a couple of points, initially. First, this amendment is not \nKatrina related. That is important. It is an attempt to bootstrap an \nidea that has been offered on the floor a number of times using the \ndisaster, the catastrophe which occurred in the Gulf with Hurricane \nKatrina. It is not Katrina related. The breakdown in communications in \nthe Katrina event was not an interoperability event. The breakdown was \nbecause the capital structure which supported the systems collapsed. \nBoth the hard line and the wireless lines were not functional as a \nresult of the infrastructure collapse. There was also a breakdown which \nwas a function of the portable radios that were being\n\n[[Page S10004]]\n\nused having to be recharged by electronic device and there was no \nelectricity to recharge them, rather than being battery driven.\n  That is the initial conclusion. It wasn't a question of the inability \nof one group to speak to another group, although that is obviously \nalways an issue. It was a fact that the entire infrastructure which \nsupported the communications systems collapsed.\n  More importantly, the proposal to add $5 billion to create a new \ngrants program is not Gulf States-focused. It is for the Nation. That \nis a position that the Senator from Michigan has always taken. This \nshould be a nationwide effort. She talks about her own State needing \nmore funds in the area of interoperability. I assume she is presuming \nthat a large amount of the dollars put into this fund would go to her \nown State and other States that had no impact from Katrina. This is not \na Katrina event. To try to put it on top of this bill in the name of \nKatrina is inappropriate. That is why I intend to make a point of order \nagainst it.\n  Secondly, it is important to remember that the issue of \ninteroperability is critical and that we are trying to address it, that \nwe have, in fact, put a dramatic amount of dollars into this effort, \nthat there is presently, in the fiscal year 2006 Homeland Security \nAppropriations bill, $2 billion that States and locals can choose to \nuse specifically to address interoperability, that we have spent $890 \nmillion in fiscal year 2004 on interoperability, and that we understand \nthat this is one of the key elements of getting our first responders to \nfunction effectively. We understand that. The Homeland Security agency \nunderstands that. But what we also understand is that there are big \nissues involved in accomplishing this that don't involve throwing money \nat the issue, the most significant of which is to reach an agreement on \nthe regime by which these agencies are going to talk to each other. \nThey haven't been able to do that.\n  It is called P-25, which is the regime they have been trying to work \nup and has been going on now for over 10 years. It is an extremely \ncomplex problem because you have a fire department in a town which will \nbuy one system, a police department which will buy another system, the \npeople who drive the ambulances will buy another system. Then you have \nlayered on top of that the State police, the highway patrol, the \nsheriff's department. All these systems have already been bought and \nalready in place, and they are not going to replace them all. How you \nget them to work together has become a complex issue. It isn't so much \na function of dollars. It is a function of reaching agreement on the \nprotocol to get them to talk to each other.\n  To put $5 billion on top of $2 billion is a nice statement of \npurpose, but it is way outside of what we can afford, as far as the \nbudget is concerned, and it is not applicable to Katrina. We are going \nto spend literally tens of billions of dollars to try to correct the \nKatrina problems. I suspect in that spending there will be money to \nrebuild the infrastructure which collapsed relative to communications. \nTo put this money on top of it in the name of Katrina, which will be \nspent across the country, is inappropriate.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I have to make a point of order against \nthis because it is clearly over the budget. It is outside the budget \nand is not Katrina related. We are already addressing it within the \nprocess which we presently have in place, which is the bill for \nHomeland Security, which passed this body with $2 billion that can be \nused for interoperability. Therefore, I make a motion that the pending \namendment increases spending and the additional spending would cause \nthe underlying bill to exceed the subcommittee's section 302(b) \nallocation. I, therefore, raise a point of order against the amendment \npursuant to section 302(f) of the Budget Act.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for purposes of the pending amendment. I ask for \nthe yeas and nays on something that is absolutely Katrina related--\ncommunications.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to waive the Budget Act in \nrelation to amendment No. 1687, as modified.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Louisiana (Mr. Vitter).\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Corzine) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign).

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, is it in order at this point for me to \nengage in a short discussion of an amendment that I have pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1670\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me take the 5 minutes now. I know \npeople are trying to put together unanimous consent requests. I \nindicated I would take just a few minutes to describe the amendment I \nhave offered, which I hope will be voted on at 12:30. They are \ndiscussing a consent agreement by which they might vote on the \namendment I have offered and I believe the amendment that Senator \nClinton has offered. Even though the unanimous consent agreement has \nnot been entered yet, let me at least describe the amendment I have \noffered.\n  The amendment I have offered is an amendment that I offered to the \narmed services bill, the Defense authorization bill that came to the \nfloor of the Senate and was on the floor for some while. This amendment \nis pending on the Defense authorization bill, but the Defense \nauthorization bill has been taken off the floor and it appears it\n\n[[Page S10005]]\n\nwill not come back to the Senate, and therefore I will not get a vote \non this amendment. So I offer the amendment to the appropriations bill, \nunderstanding this is not the optimum place to do this. I will have to \nsuspend the rules to accomplish it. But let me describe what it is.\n  We are spending billions and billions of dollars on reconstruction in \nIraq. I will read some headlines.\n  Let me say at the start, the minute anyone comes to this floor and \nmentions the word ``Halliburton,'' they think it is partisan, \npolitical, going after the Vice President of the United States. It is \nnot. It is true he was the CEO of Halliburton, but that was long before \nhe reentered public service as Vice President, and none of this has \nhappened under his watch. This has nothing to do with the Vice \nPresident.\n  What it does have something to do with is large, no-bid contracts \ngiven to a very large company, large no-bid contracts with virtually no \noversight and a substantial waste of the taxpayers' money. Let me read \nsome headlines.\n\n       Houston Chronicle, February 3, 2004:\n       Uncle Sam Looks Into Meal Bills; Halliburton Refunds $27 \n     Million as a Result.\n       Houston Chronicle, February 4, 2004:\n       Halliburton Faces Criminal Investigation: Pentagon Proving \n     Alleged Overcharges for Iraq Fuel.\n       Los Angeles Times, February 13, 2004:\n       Ex-Halliburton Workers Allege Rampant Waste: They Say the \n     Firm Makes No Effort to Control Costs.\n       May 18, 2004, Houston Chronical:\n       U.S. Questions More Halliburton Meal Charges.\n       July 27, 2004, Houston Chronicle:\n       Millions in U.S. Property Lost in Iraq, Reports Say; \n     Halliburton Claims Figures Only ``Projections.''\n       The Los Angeles Times, August 12, 2004:\n       Halliburton Is Unable to Prove $1.8 Billion in Work, \n     Pentagon Says.\n\n  Is anybody investigating this? No. This is a company that charges for \n42,000 meals served in Iraq, and it turns out they are serving 14,000 \nmeals to soldiers. We are paying for 42,000 meals. Does anybody care? \nOvercharges for fuel? These are big, no-bid contracts. And oh, by the \nway, the courageous woman in the Pentagon, Bonnatine Greenhouse, the \nhighest civilian in the Corps of Engineers responsible for making sure \nthese contracts are handled the right way, is the one who objected to \nthese contracts saying it was, in effect, a good old boys club giving \ncontracts to their friends. Guess what. This woman, who received \nexcellent reviews all of her career and rose to become the highest \nranking civilian officials in the Corps of Engineers, has been demoted. \nWhy? Because she had the courage to speak up and speak out.\n  Nobody is investigating the rampant misuse of funds and waste of \nfunds in these no-bid contracts. There should be oversight hearings in \nthe Congress, but there are not. There is not an oversight hearing held \non these issues, so I have chaired Democratic Policy hearings, and let \nme tell you a couple of things we have heard.\n  How about brand new trucks, $85,000 trucks. Drive one down the road \nin Iraq and get a flat tire and what do you do with it? Abandon it. It \ngets torched. A brand new truck. If it has a fuel pump that is plugged, \nwhat do you do with it? Abandon it. It doesn't matter--no-bid \ncontracts. It is all taxpayers' money. It is unbelievable what we have \nuncovered.\n  Serving food to soldiers with date stamps that have long since \nexpired and the supervisors say it doesn't matter: Serve them anyway.\n  They order towels. The guy who worked for the Halliburton company as \nthe purchaser said he was told you can't just order towels for soldiers \nthat are just towels; you need to put a logo on the towels. So you put \nthe company logo on the towels, and you double the price of the towels \nthat go to soldiers, so you have the company logo on the towel. It is \nunbelievable waste, fraud, and abuse. It is not millions or hundreds of \nmillions of dollars, it is billions dollars, and nobody is minding the \nstore. Nobody cares.\n  Some years ago, in 1941, Harry Truman stood in this Chamber, and he \nsaid there is rampant waste, fraud, and abuse going on in military \ncontracting, and we ought to get to the bottom of it. He was \nrelentless. He was a Democrat here in this Chamber, and we had a \nDemocrat in the White House. It didn't matter. I am sure that was kind \nof an uncomfortable thing; it didn't matter. They set up a Truman \ncommittee, a special committee that uncovered massive amounts of waste, \nfraud, and abuse.\n  In this case, we know it is happening. We have direct testimony it is \nhappening with big, no-bid contracts--particularly with Halliburton, \nbut there are others as well--and nobody seems to care. Nobody seems to \ncare.\n  I propose that we create a type of Truman committee, of the type we \nhave had previously, that starts taking a good look at waste, fraud, \nand abuse that is occurring. Whenever you give massive quantities of \nmoney on a no-bid contract and say go ahead and spend, you are going to \nhave this waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  There are stories about someone saying: Let's air-condition that \nbuilding in Iraq. We will buy some air-conditioners through this \nreconstruction funding, and then it goes from a contractor to another \nsubcontractor to a sub, and pretty soon the job is done, you have a \nceiling fan, and the American taxpayer has paid for air-conditioning. \nIt is unbelievable, and it is going on all the time.\n  My proposal is very simple. When American taxpayers' money is doled \nout in such enormous quantities--billions of dollars--somebody ought to \nwatch the store.\n\n  I held up a poster the other day of stacks of 100-dollar bills which \nwere wrapped in Saran Wrap--stacked in big piles because the \ncontracting officer, who testified at the committee which I chaired, \nsaid that is the way it was. We said to the contracting companies: \nBring cash and bring a bag. We do business in cash. He said: We used to \nactually play football with these stacks of 100-dollar bills with Saran \nWrap. You could actually throw them back and forth across the room. \nThey were paying for the ministries, among other things, in Iraq during \nthe Coalition Provisional Authority, which was us, by the way. They \nwere paying one Iraqi ministry for 8,206 security guards on duty--\npaying 2,206 of them salaries--and there were only 602.\n  Does anybody care? Does anybody care about this? Will this Congress \nfinally do what it is required to do--to require accountability for the \nexpenditure of the taxpayers' money?\n  We have spent a massive amount of money dealing with contracting in \nIraq for reconstruction. What we are finding is that the few people who \nhad the courage to blow the whistle about favorite contracts--no-bid \ncontracts--having contractors even in the room, in the meeting, when \nthey were with talking about what the specs of the contract should be. \nBunnatine Greenhouse, a young African-American woman who rose to the \ntop, the highest civilian job in the Corps of Engineers, blew the \nwhistle on this old boys network that was doling out that money to \nprivate contractors, she is going to pay for it with her job, we are \ntold. Shame on them.\n  This Congress ought to have the courage to stand up on the side of \nthe taxpayers and say: If we are spending taxpayers' money, the \ntaxpayers ought to get full value for it. We ought to put an end to \nwaste, fraud and because.\n  When Harry Truman got to the White House, he had a sign on his desk \nthat said ``The Buck Stops Here.'' For accountability on this sort of \nthing, the buck doesn't stop anywhere. Nobody wants to look them square \nin the eye. It is time for Congress to look truth in the eye and \nunderstand what is happening. My amendment is the first opportunity to \ndo that.\n  I regret that we didn't have a vote on it on the Defense \nauthorization bill. That is where it should have been. I offered it on \nthe authorization bill. The bill has been pulled from the calendar and \nfrom the floor and apparently will not come back. I will offer it today \nand to other appropriations bills. It is uncomfortable, I suppose, for \nthose who do not want to vote against this, but they are going to have \nto keep voting against it until at some point there will be sufficient \nvotes in this Chamber to do what is right. To do what is right is to \nfollow the model of Harry Truman. Even when there was a Democrat in the \nWhite House, a Democrat said: We insist, we demand, accountability on \nbehalf of the American taxpayers, and we are going to put an end to \nwaste, fraud, and abuse of taxpayers' money.\n  It is very simple. This is not a complex amendment. It is the \nsimplest of\n\n[[Page S10006]]\n\namendments and the simplest of choices.\n  In this Chamber--the Chamber of the Senate--we don't do very \ncomplicated things. Every single choice that we make every day on this \nfloor is either yes or no. There is no maybe, no later; it is when it \ncomes time to vote yes or no.\n  That, it seems to me, is an enormously simple choice with respect to \nan amendment that is this persuasive.\n  I hope the Senate, when it votes midday today on this amendment, will \ndo the right thing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1707\n\n    (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding funding \n     directives contained in H.R. 2862 or its accompanying report)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1707:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) In a time of national catastrophe, it is the \n     responsibility of Congress and the Executive Branch to take \n     quick and decisive action to help those in need.\n       (2) The size, scope, and complexity of Hurricane Katrina \n     are unprecedented, and the emergency response and long-term \n     recovery efforts will be extensive and require significant \n     resources.\n       (3) It is the responsibility of Congress and the Executive \n     Branch to ensure the financial stability of the nation by \n     being good stewards of Americans' hard-earned tax dollars.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that any funding directive contained in this Act, or its \n     accompanying report, that is not specifically authorized in \n     any Federal law as of the date of enactment of this section, \n     or Act or resolution passed by the Senate during the 1st \n     Session of the 109th Congress prior to such date, or proposed \n     in pursuance to an estimate submitted in accordance with law, \n     that is for the benefit of an identifiable program, project, \n     activity, entity, or jurisdiction and is not directly related \n     to the impact of Hurricane Katrina, may be redirected to \n     recovery efforts if the appropriate head of an agency or \n     department determines, after consultation with appropriate \n     Congressional Committees, that the funding directive is not \n     of national significance or is not in the public interest.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1670\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order with respect \nto amendment 1670.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the \namendment violates rule XVI.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, pursuant to the notice properly filed, I \nmove to suspend the rule with respect to amendment No. 1670, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that Senator Durbin be added as a \ncosponsor of that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that the \nvote on the motion to suspend the rules occur at 12:30 today and that \nno amendments be in order to the amendment prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1660\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order with respect \nto the Clinton amendment No. 1660.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the \namendment violates rule XVI.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Clinton, pursuant to \nthe notice she properly filed, I move to suspend the rules with respect \nto amendment No. 1660, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote \noccur on the motion to suspend the rules on the Clinton amendment \nimmediately following the vote in relation to the Dorgan amendment with \n2 minutes equally divided prior to the vote, and further that no second \ndegrees be in order to the amendment prior to the vote; provided, \nfurther, that all time until the vote be equally divided in the usual \nform.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1707\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to return to the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the clerk for reading the \namendment in its entirety for the benefit of my colleagues. I thank the \nchairman for his agreement to accept this amendment on a voice vote, \nand I thank him for his assistance. I understand it has been agreed to \nby the Democratic side.\n  Mr. President, the sense-of-the-Senate amendment is simple, and it is \nvery modest. It is an attempt to rein in wasteful spending, \nparticularly during this time when portions of our country along the \nGulf are enduring the devastating impact of Hurricane Katrina--indeed a \nnational tragedy. As the Nation continues to manage the aftermath of \nHurricane Katrina, it is imperative that Congress do what it can and \nwhat it must to help the hundreds of thousands of victims of one of the \nworst natural disasters in our history. I think all of us in this body \nhave said that time after time. Congress must do all that is necessary \nto fund the essential relief and recovery efforts and help those in \nneed.\n  The cost of the recovery and relief effort is enormous, and will \ncontinue to be, and it should go without saying that we live in times \nof great need and limited resources. In these times, Americans are \ncalled to sacrifice, and Congress needs to make sacrifices of its own. \nTo the extent that it is possible, we should pay for this effort now \nrather than pass on even more debt to future generations.\n  We should also make better use of taxpayers' money by eliminating our \nspending on matters of questionable merit or which are nonessential in \norder to better assist the victims of Katrina. These are times when \nMembers of Congress need to deny themselves a few of the comforts of \npolitical office and refrain from directing tax dollars to special \nprojects in their States. These projects might help political \ncampaigns, but they do not necessarily benefit the country as a whole. \nRegrettably, as far back as I can recall, Congress has found ways to \nfund thousands of unauthorized projects of questionable merit through \nappropriations bills. Perhaps some of these dollars would have been \nbetter spent on activities that might have limited the impact of this \ntragedy. We are now hearing information that a great deal of money was \nspent in Louisiana on projects that were less necessary perhaps--and I \nemphasize ``perhaps'' because a thorough investigation needs to be \ncompleted--that should have been spent on more important protection of \nlevees and other wetlands and other more meritorious projects.\n  This year's Commerce, State, Justice, Science and Related Agencies \nappropriations bill, H.R. 2862, is relatively restrained compared to \nrecent bills that have moved through the Senate.\n  I congratulate the subcommittee chairman from Alabama and the ranking \nmember.\n  Still, the legislation contains several examples of the types of \nprovisions that magically appear in too many of the appropriations \nbills that benefit parochial interests, with little regard to the \nmerits, at the expense of national priorities.\n  I make this statement and propose this sense-of-the-Senate amendment \nin the hope that my colleagues appreciate that we are now adding \nperhaps $100 billion, or even $150 billion, additionally to the \ndeficit, which is already projected to be the third highest in history, \nsome 300-and-some billions of dollars.\n  For example, H.R. 2862 contains several earmarks that funds \ninitiatives that some, including myself, might\n\n[[Page S10007]]\n\nconsider to be of less-than-pressing importance. Among them is a $10 \nmillion earmark for the Alaska Fisheries Marketing Board, and a $1.75 \nmillion earmark for something called the Hawaii Humpback Education \nProgram.\n  I have no idea what the Hawaii Humpback Education Program is. I would \nimagine it has a lot to do with whales.\n  I don't know what the Alaska Fisheries Marketing Board is, except \nthat I know it continues to receive earmark funding in the \nmultimillions of dollars every year, as I examine appropriations bills.\n  The bill also provided needed funding for grants to the Small \nBusiness Administration, and they are needed funds for grants. \nUnfortunately, this bill recommends that the SBA direct funding to 53 \nspecific programs named in the committee report.\n  I want to talk about that for a second.\n  The committee report has no enforcement of law, but the \nappropriations committees have made it very clear to the various \nagencies that they do have, in their view, the enforcement of law.\n  So we have the worst of all worlds here; we have it in a committee \nreport which cannot be removed by amendment, and, yet, at the same \ntime, even though it technically doesn't have the force of law, it is \nmade clear to the agencies that are affected that they will pay a heavy \nprice if they do not carry out the dictates of the committee report.\n  It is imperative, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, that the SBA \ngrants be awarded on the basis of need and merit and for no other \nreason.\n  The sense-of-the-Senate amendment that I propose would allow funding \nfor earmarks that have not been authorized, have not been requested by \nthe President or not related to the impact of Hurricane Katrina to be \nredirected to recovery efforts.\n  In other words, the $1.75 million earmark for the Hawaii Humpback \nEducation Program would be directed to the recovery and rescue efforts \nassociated with Hurricane Katrina.\n  This would occur when the Agency or Department head determines, after \nconsultation with the appropriate congressional committees, that such \nan earmark is not of national significance or is not in the public \ninterest.\n  Now there will be arguments in consultation with these appropriation \ncommittees that they are of national significance or in the public \ninterest. I argue that determination should be made on the basis of the \nscenario which I described earlier.\n  I expected this amendment to be easily adopted and not take much of \nthe Senate's time. But after discussion with the appropriators and \ntheir staff, I thank the manager and the minority, the Democratic \nleader and their staff, for modifications to the amendment. I hope this \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment will be taken seriously.\n  I could propose the impossible: that no earmarks be permitted in any \nappropriations bill, period. But I am not proposing the impossible. Or \nI could propose what is suggested almost daily by the press, that \nCongress turn in its pork. Many are rightly calling into question the \nthousands of projects in the highway bill and suggesting the related \nproject funding should more wisely be transferred to recovery efforts. \nThe amendment isn't proposing that, either. But perhaps next time that \nwill be the proposal I offer, particularly given the dire situation in \nthe gulf. We cannot even agree to preclude funding for projects not \nfound to be in the public interest.\n  I repeat, it is a modest proposal. I hope my colleagues \noverwhelmingly adopt it for the sake of the tens of thousands of \nAmericans who have lost almost everything and are relying on their \nGovernment for necessary support as they struggle for what will be a \nlong and difficult time. I also hope we keep in mind future generations \nof Americans who will be inheriting this deficit which is now going to \nbe probably one of the largest in history.\n  I call upon the appropriators and the leadership to pay careful \nattention to the funding measures yet to be debated and to do their \npart to ensure that we are living up to our obligations to those who \nare suffering, even if it means it comes at some of our personal \npolitical expense.\n  In a time of national catastrophe it is the responsibility of the \nCongress to take quick and decisive action to help those in need. It is \nnot appropriate to continue the practice of earmarking scarce funds in \nthe face of such a tragedy. This should be a time of sacrifice for the \nsake of our suffering citizens. I repeat, it is a modest proposal.\n  I found a curious thing happen in the last few days. Newspapers \nranging from the New York Times to the Wall Street Journal to the \nWashington Times all editorialized in the same fashion.\n  I ask unanimous consent New York Times editorial entitled ``Bring Out \nYour Pork,'' and Washington Times editorial called ``Pork and Hurricane \nRelief,'' and from the Wall Street Journal entitled ``A `Moronic' \nProposal'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Sept. 8, 2005]\n\n                          Bring Out Your Pork\n\n       Fair warning to the suffering Gulf Coast masses: Congress \n     is already talking of concocting economic stimulus'' and \n     ``job creation'' packages as hurricane recovery tools. That \n     sounds useful, but unfortunately those terms usually signal \n     that the House and the Senate are about to use the crisis of \n     the moment to roll out wasteful tax cuts for the well-off and \n     pork barrel outlays for hometown voters.\n       The overwhelming need of the victims of Hurricane Katrina, \n     coupled with the nation's shock at government ineptitude, \n     should inspire members of Congress to sober up and become \n     something approaching responsible policy makers. If they do \n     decide to reform, there's an easy way to prove it. They could \n     turn in their pork.\n       This summer, when Congress had to ignore only a war in \n     Iraq, it passed the annual highway bill, repackaged as a job-\n     creation measure. The legislation set a record of $24 billion \n     in 6,371 ``earmark amendments''--the route individual \n     lawmakers take to lock in prized projects for their home \n     districts, regardless of proven need.\n       The bipartisan boondoggles that made it under the wire \n     included vanity highways, tourist sidewalks, snowmobile \n     trails, a ``deer avoidance'' plan and a graffiti elimination \n     program for New York. Those wishing to look for still more \n     unnecessary spending can consider the White House's $130-\n     billion-and-counting missile defense system, which remains \n     thoroughly inoperable.\n       Hurricane Katrina cries out to Congress for something other \n     than business as usual. Imagine what would happen if each \n     member of Congress announced that he or she would give up a \n     prize slab of bacon so the government would be able to use \n     the money to shelter hurricane victims and rebuild New \n     Orleans. The public would--for once--have proof that \n     politicians are capable of setting priorities and showing \n     respect for the concept of a budget.\n       Surely Representative Don Young, the Alaska Republican who \n     is chairman of the transportation committee, might put off \n     that $223 million ``bridge to nowhere'' in his state's \n     outback. It's redundant now--Louisiana suddenly has several \n     bridges to nowhere. Likewise, Speaker Dennis Hastert could \n     defer his prized Prairie Parkway, a $200-million-plus project \n     dismissed as a behemoth Sprawlway by hometown critics, and \n     use the money to repair the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway.\n       The Democratic minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, could afford \n     to donate back some multimillion-dollar plums--just one bike \n     and pedestrian overpass, perhaps, or a ferry terminal. \n     Another Democratic standout, James Oberstar of Minnesota, \n     would have a hard time choosing from his cornucopia, but that \n     $2.7 million for what is already described as the nation's \n     longest paved recreational trail looks ripe.\n       The list is long. Such a gesture by the Capitol's patronage \n     first responders would encourage a sense of shared sacrifice \n     in the nation. Members might actually be surprised to see how \n     many of their own constituents are prepared to think of other \n     people's needs before themselves. This page has been a \n     longtime supporter of a freight tunnel between New Jersey and \n     New York--which, we should point out, is actually a tunnel to \n     somewhere. But we'd applaud a delay in the $100 million for \n     freight-tunnel design studies that was included in the \n     highway bill if it was part of a larger reordering of \n     priorities.\n       It's time to put New Orleans first.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     [From the Wall Street Journal]\n\n                         A ``Moronic'' Proposal\n\n       Some public-spirited folks in Bozeman, Montana, have come \n     up with a wonderful idea to help Uncle Sam offset some of the \n     $62 billion federal cost of Hurricane Katrina relief. The \n     Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports that Montanans from both \n     sides of the political aisle have petitioned the city council \n     to give the feds back a $4 million earmark to pay for a \n     parking garage in the just-passed $286 billion highway bill. \n     As one of these citizens, Jane Shaw, told us: ``We figure New \n     Orleans needs the money right now a lot more than we need \n     extra downtown parking space.''\n       Which got us thinking: Why not cancel all of the special-\n     project pork in the highway\n\n[[Page S10008]]\n\n     bill and dedicate the $25 billion in savings to emergency \n     relief on the Gulf Coast? Is it asking too much for Richmond, \n     Indiana, to give up $3 million for its hiking trail, or \n     Newark, New Jersey, to put a hold on its $2 million bike \n     path?\n       And in the face of the worst natural disaster in U.S. \n     history, couldn't Alaskans put a hold on the infamous $454 \n     million earmark for the two ``bridges to nowhere'' that will \n     serve a town of 50 people? That same half a billion dollars \n     could rebuild thousands of homes for suffering New Orleans \n     evacuees. One obstacle to this idea apparently will be Don \n     Young, the House Transportation Committee Chairman who \n     captured the funds for Alaska in the first place. A spokesman \n     in his office told the Anchorage Daily News that the pork-\n     for-relief swap was ``moronic.'' Sounds like someone who \n     wants Mr. Young to become ``ranking Member'' next Congress.\n       In all there are more than 6,000 of these parochial \n     projects--or about 14 for every Congressional district--\n     funded in the highway bill. The pork reduction plan is \n     particularly appropriate as a response to Katrina, because we \n     have learned in recent days that one reason that money was \n     not spent on fortifying the levees in New Orleans was that \n     hundreds of millions of dollars were rerouted to glitzier \n     earmarked projects throughout the state of Louisiana.\n       We're hearing all sorts of bad ideas about how to offset \n     the $62 billion of spending already authorized for Hurricane \n     Katrina relief. Cancel the Bush tax cuts, raise the gasoline \n     tax by $1 a gallon, increase deficit spending, and sharply \n     cut spending on national defense and the war in Iraq. In \n     Washington, it seems, everything is expendable except for the \n     slabs of bacon that are carved out of the federal fisc to \n     ensure re-election.\n       The glory of what is happening in Bozeman is that taxpayers \n     are proving to be wiser about priorities than their \n     politicians. We like the suggestion by Ronald Utt of the \n     Foundation Heritage that, when the new levee is built to \n     protect the Big Easy from future storms, it should bear a \n     bronze plaque stamped: ``Proudly Brought to You by the \n     Citizens of Alaska.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      [From the Washington Times]\n\n                       Pork and Hurricane Relief\n\n       ``We should lead by example and give up a few of the things \n     we want in order to give hurricane victims the things they \n     need,'' Sens. John McCain and Tim Coburn told their \n     colleagues. Correct, as far as it goes, but the call to arms \n     rings hollow without specifics. Here's a start: Congress \n     should redirect the transportation bill's $25 billion toward \n     hurricane relief.\n       Congress appropriated $51.8 billion in emergency-relief \n     money for Hurricane Katrina's victims, and suspended the \n     normal rules and procedures so the bill would not get \n     entangled in special interests or endless debates. That made \n     sense; lives were at stake and the money was needed at once. \n     But Congress can listen now to those who want to cut \n     discretionary spending so money can be sent for \n     reconstruction in the Gulf states. Congress could erase half \n     that total with the transportation bill earmarks.\n       Before Katrina, these earmarks were hardly necessary; \n     today, they look like an abdication of duty. As we noted last \n     month, the most outrageous items in this $286 billion bill \n     were $229 billion for a highway called ``Don Young's Way'' in \n     Alaska, a favorite of the Republican chairman of the House \n     Transportation Committee; $18.75 million for the ``Highway to \n     Nowhere,'' linking Ketchikan, Alaska, to the island of \n     Gravina, population 50; and $20 million for a Magnetic \n     Levitation Transportation System linking Las Vegas and Primm, \n     Nev. Naturally the guilty legislators defended those projects \n     as necessary spending on vital local needs. Of course.\n       These projects look particularly foolish now. Katrina has \n     blown the roof off business as usual in Washington, and \n     rightly so.\n       Several congressmen appear to get it. Rep. Jeb Hensarling, \n     Texas Republican, offered an amendment to the hurricane-\n     relief bill that would have required the House to offset the \n     new Katrina spending with reductions in other spending. Mr. \n     Hensarling, a fiscal conservative, isn't above pragmatism: He \n     would exempt entitlements, homeland-security and defense \n     spending and veteran's affairs from the cuts. But the House \n     didn't consider his amendment because it wanted spending \n     passage of the relief legislation.\n       Now that the emergency bill has been enacted, Congress \n     should reconsider ideas like the Hensarling amendment. And if \n     Mr. McCain and Mr. Coburn are serious about leading by \n     example, they will step up to lead by example. Congress can \n     show seriousness by scrapping Mr. Young's ``Highway to \n     Nowhere'' and send the money to the right somewhere--to \n     rebuild New Orleans and the Mississippi coast.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this is interesting. I don't think in all \nmy years I have seen all three of these different periodicals coming \nfrom somewhat different philosophical bases all editorializing in the \nsame fashion.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, as I understand it, in about 5 minutes \nwe will be voting on two amendments. One is to establish a Truman-like \ncommission to see if there has been profiteering in the contracts in \nrelation to the Iraq war.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1660\n\n  Madam President, there is also another amendment offered by the \nSenator from New York, Mrs. Clinton, on a Katrina commission \nrecommendation. I am a cosponsor of that amendment. Prior to the vote, \nI would now like to make a few remarks in support of the establishment \nof a Katrina commission.\n  This weekend I reflected--as I am sure the Presiding Officer did when \nyou\n\n[[Page S10009]]\n\nwere with your family and maybe made it back to Alaska with \nconstituents--that two tragedies have hit our country. One is 9/11, \nwhich we can never, ever forget. How grateful we are to the 9/11 \nCommission for their rigorous investigation as to what happened: what \nwent wrong, what went right; what went wrong--the failure of \ncommunications and technology and intelligence; what went right--the \nbravery of people, the spirit of America.\n  Then, also, the 9/11 Commission made concrete recommendations. In \nfact, they are meeting this week to issue a report card on how well we \nhave done to implement their recommendations. Three cheers for the 9/11 \nCommission on what they have done and what they continue to do.\n  All of America has been mesmerized by what has happened in the Gulf--\nin New Orleans, in Louisiana, in Alabama, and, of course, in \nMississippi.\n  Senator Clinton's idea--she will be here shortly to express it, and I \nconcur--is that we also have a commission now to look at the response \nto the Katrina situation. We appreciate the fact that the President has \ntaken responsibility, and he himself wants to know what went right and \nwhat went wrong. We think that is a very good move on the President's \npart. We support him.\n  Second, we know there will be good efforts by our own colleagues, \nparticularly in the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, which is very ably chaired by our colleague from Maine, \nSenator Collins, and of which Senator Lieberman is ranking member.\n  But it is us investigating us. It is the President looking at his own \nexecutive branch. I do not doubt the integrity of the President. I do \nnot doubt the vigor and pursuit that the Governmental Affairs Committee \nwill have. Golly, just look at their record on intel reform. I think we \nknow they really do operate with intellectual rigor and integrity. But \nI do believe we need an outside group that will look at us and develop \nan opinion that will be truly independent, made up of appointees from \nboth sides of the aisle. They would absolutely not be political, even \nthough some might have a background in politics.\n  Governor Kean did a fabulous job chairing the Commission along with \nour former colleague, Congressman Lee Hamilton. They had a wonderful \narray of people on the 9/11 Commission.\n  So we owe it to the people of the Gulf and we owe it to the people of \nthe United States of America to examine this situation and not to do \nfinger-pointing. We do not need any more finger-pointing but we sure do \nneed pinpointing as to what collapsed, what was not in place.\n  Some years ago, I led the reform effort of FEMA. We started with \nPresident Bush 1 and then kept going under President Bill Clinton, who \ngave us James Lee Witt. FEMA should be one of our premier agencies \nfocusing on readiness, response, and recovery. What went wrong? Was it \nus? Did we neglect in oversight? Did we neglect funding Corps of \nEngineers projects? I really don't know that. And maybe we did not \nneglect anything, but nature had enough with our bad behavior and \nkicked us a little bit.\n  So I really want to know that, and why. One reason is so it will \nnever happen again, just like we never want a predatory attack on the \nUnited States of America, which is why out of 9/11 came intel reform \nand now the followup. We do not want this result ever to happen again \nwhen a natural disaster strikes--whether it is a hurricane that hits \ncoastal States or whether it is an earthquake, which I know the \nPresiding Officer's own dear beloved State is possibly subjected to and \nwhich our colleagues from California worry about, and our colleagues \nfrom Missouri worry about that fault that goes right down through \nMissouri.\n  So we have to make sure we have an independent analysis. We would \nthen take what the President finds, take what our colleagues find, and \nlisten to an independent commission so we can make sure we are truly \nready, we are truly able to respond, and then to make sure we have the \nwherewithal to do recovery.\n  This could have been a dirty bomb in any city in the United States. \nCould we evacuate? Would communications be interoperable? What would \nhappen to the poor and the sick? Are they collateral damage? Nobody in \nAmerica is ever collateral damage. We have to have plans. What happens \nto our first responders? If there is an evacuation plan, who evacuates \ntheir families while they are protecting us? These are the kinds of \nquestions, these are the kinds of things that need to go into the \nplanning.\n  Right now, all that many of us see is that we have spent a lot of \nmoney on homeland security. But what I see is a lot of salesmen out \nthere selling gear. In fact, sometimes I think there are more salesmen \nselling gear than there are first responders. We need to be effective. \nWe need to be smart. I want my country to be safer. I want my country \nto be stronger. But I think we need to be smarter. This is why I think \na good step forward would be an independent commission, not to finger-\npoint but to pinpoint, so that never ever again would any community \nhave to suffer or that they could be in a position to recover better.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY.

Mr. President, I have offered an amendment to create an \nindependent commission, known as the Katrina Commission, to investigate \nwith outside experts the situation we have confronted for the last 2 \nweeks in the Gulf Coast. This vote is on a motion to suspend the rules \nto consider this amendment. I hope that we have bipartisan support to \ndo just that. There are a number of committees that have a role in this \nCongress to conduct oversight, to ask questions, but just as with 9/11 \nwe did not get to the point where we believed we understood what \nhappened until an independent investigation was conducted.\n  This legislation is modeled on the 9/11 Commission. The President \nappoints the chairman. The Republican and Democratic leaders appoint \nthe members. This will provide us an opportunity to do the \ninvestigation away from the work that needs to happen in this Congress \nand in the administration, to meet the immediate needs of the people in \nthe Gulf Coast. I hope we will vote to support the Katrina Commission.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to suspend the rule for \nconsideration of amendment No. 1660.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and that we call up amendment No. 1695.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry], for himself and \n     Ms. Landrieu, proposes an amendment numbered 1695.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is printed in the Record of Tuesday, September 13, \n2005, under ``Text of amendments.''\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I offer this amendment, together with \nSenator Landrieu, to provide comprehensive relief to small businesses \nharmed by Hurricane Katrina. There are two reasons why it is important \nto do this at this time on this bill.\n  No. 1, the $63 billion of combined assistance in the two supplemental \nspending bills doesn't allocate one portion of it to small businesses \nspecifically. So there is no small business relief--no funding for \nsmall business assistance within the structure of the SBA or for other \nsmall business assistance programs Congress has created.\n  No. 2, this appropriations bill is the funding source for the Small \nBusiness Administration. It is through the Small Business \nAdministration that disaster loan assistance is available for \nhomeowners and for business owners, and it is through the Small \nBusiness Administration that the Federal Government provides the full \ncomplement of assistance to the small businesses of our Nation. So it \nis appropriate for us to be doing this at this time. The SBA is \nindispensable to the recovery of the gulf region after Hurricane \nKatrina.\n  I was down there on Monday and could see for myself the numbers of \nsmall business people who are impacted, listening to the Governor, the \nLieutenant Governor, Congressman Jefferson and others, all of whom \ndescribed how critical this help is going to be. The States concerned--\nAlabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana--are still in the process of \nassessing the full extent of the damage. There are an estimated 800,000 \nsmall businesses in those three States, but already we have received \nreports that more than 100,000 in Louisiana and some 50,000 in \nMississippi were damaged or destroyed completely.\n  We also know that in Louisiana alone, small businesses provide more \nthan 65 percent of the jobs. Sixty-five percent is typical for most of \nAmerica, which is why Senator after Senator comes to the floor and goes \nhome to their States and talks about the importance of small business \nto the American economy.\n  What the mayor of Baton Rouge told me, what the Governors told me, \nand other officials I spoke with, is how critical it is to be able to \nget the local population back to work as fast as possible and to try to \nmitigate against some of the dislocation.\n  The only way we are going to get people back to work, the only way we \nget these areas thriving again, is to make small business a priority of \nthe recovery itself.\n  Our amendment recognizes that it is going to take months, if not \nyears, for a lot of businesses to get back to normal. SBA's Federal \ndisaster loans and physical damage loans and economic injury loans are \ngoing to play a critical role in this recovery.\n  Our amendment also recognizes that similar to the domino effect of \nthe 9/11 attacks--the domino effect that those attacks had on our \neconomy in other places--we need to help not only those businesses \nphysically located within the declared disaster area, but also an awful \nlot of businesses that have been indirectly harmed because of the loss \nof business directly to those areas or because of the increase in fuel \nprices.\n  The tourism industry, for instance, is so important to New Orleans \nand has suppliers around the country. Travel agents who book \nconferences, companies that provide food and beverages and supplies for \nthe hotels, restaurants, and bars. Suddenly they have no orders. There \nare small businesses that could help rebuild the damaged and destroyed \nhomes, businesses, and infrastructure of the gulf region. But they need \nlegal protection to make sure they can be part of the Federal contracts \npaying for these projects and services.\n  One of the reasons for this is that too often the Federal Government, \nin its effort to move rapidly, which we understand, takes the easiest \nroute or path of least resistance and gives big contracts to the \nHalliburtons of the world, leaving a lot of the local economy and small \nbusinesses still gasping, looking for their way into that pipeline.\n\n  Then, of course, there is the underestimated but, frankly, always \nessential counselor component. A lot of small businesses need help \nfiguring out how to restructure, how to process all of this, how to \nmake up for the loss of business. Many of them have viable businesses. \nWith a small amount of assistance they can keep that viability and \nminimize the negative impact to our economy and to their business.\n  In order to put this package together in a way that addressed the \nreal needs\n\n[[Page S10011]]\n\nof the communities, I have worked closely with Senator Landrieu who, \nalong with her staff, has worked tirelessly in recent days to determine \nwhat the businesses in her State need to get Louisiana small business \non the road to recovery. I think we ought to be encouraged--frankly, \nall of us in the Senate ought to be encouraged--at how much we can do \nunder the auspices of the Small Business Administration, recognizing \nthat a lot of these businesses have no way of fully operating now or \nany time soon. We try to take steps to defer for 2 years the interest \nand the principal payment for those businesses located directly in the \ndisaster area, those that have been adversely impacted. For small \nbusinesses directly impacted, we permit them to use disaster loans, \nwhich have interest rates capped at 4 percent. I remind my colleagues \nthat these are loans. These aren't grants. We allow small businesses to \nrefinance existing disaster loans and existing business debt in order \nto consolidate their debt and lower their interest payments.\n  For those small businesses directly impacted that had SBA 7(a) and \n504 loans before Katrina, if they are unable to make their payments, we \ndirect the SBA to assume the payments for up to 2 years or until the \nbusinesses can resume payments earlier on their own.\n  For small businesses that are directly impacted, such as suppliers to \nthe extensive tourism industry in the gulf coast, we make available SBA \n7(a) loans at reduced rates, with protections to make sure that those \nwho need the loans are the ones getting them.\n  For small businesses that need counseling, we increase funding to \nSBA's counseling partners to serve businesses, whether they are in \nLouisiana, Mississippi, or Alabama, or whether they are still displaced \nin other States such as Texas or Arizona.\n  We put in place contracting protections to encourage the Federal \nGovernment to help rebuild the economy by using local businesses or \nsmall businesses.\n  We authorize $400 million in grants to the States in the declared \ndisaster areas in order to make immediate bridge loans or grants to \nthose small businesses directly harmed by Hurricane Katrina that need \naccess to money immediately and can't wait for the disbursement of \nFederal loans or other assistance. This has worked in the past, and it \ncan work now.\n  As we all know, Hurricane Katrina knocked out roughly 10 percent of \nU.S. oil refining and natural gas pipeline capacity. That has caused \nprices for gasoline and natural gas to go through the roof all over the \ncountry. Experts estimate the impact is going to hit us in the winter \nas well when heating oil prices are going to increase as much as 70 \npercent. To help small businesses and farmers and manufacturers that \nare being crippled by these energy prices, we give them access to low-\ncost disaster loans.\n  This is a very straightforward example of how businesses outside the \ndisaster area have been indirectly and seriously adversely impacted.\n  The other day, I was driving through a couple of States well north of \nWashington, DC--not in Massachusetts but New Jersey, New York, and \nelsewhere--and the gas prices are all reflecting the effects of \nKatrina. Small farmers in the Presiding Officer's State of South \nDakota, North Dakota, Wisconsin, Iowa, and all across the country are \ndeeply impacted by the cost of fuel for their tractors or for their \ntrucks for deliveries all across the country. This will help the small \nbusinesses and farmers and manufacturers that are being crippled.\n  The high cost of energy is making American manufacturing \nnoncompetitive. Talk to truckers who are traversing the Nation about \nthe cost of fuel. It's a huge portion of the current price of goods \nconsumed by the increased energy prices. The result is a lot of folks \nwho are teetering on the edge with loans out and financed are now \nfinding themselves in economic difficulty. So this is a way to help \nthem, and this tries to do that.\n  I point out to my colleagues that previously the energy relief \nportion of this amendment has passed the Senate three times. There are \n37 Republican Senators currently in the Senate who have previously \nvoted for this on several occasions. Our hope is that we can proceed \nforward.\n  In addition, to help drive down the impact of Hurricane Katrina and \nits toll on the economy as a whole--including added costs to health \ncare for small business, energy for small business, and rising interest \nrates--we temporarily lower the interest rate set by the Federal \nGovernment itself. There is no need for us to recoup at the same rate, \nif it helps those businesses remain viable.\n  The Congressional Hispanic Caucus has been calling for this relief \nfor Hispanic small business owners because ever since the \nadministration raised the fees on 7(a) loans, loans to Hispanics have \nfallen by 14 percent. With the added problems to the economy caused by \nHurricane Katrina, making capital more affordable is a way to open the \ndoors of opportunity and to help people to be able to keep the economy \nmoving.\n  In closing, I thank Senator Reid, Senator Mikulski, and Senator \nLandrieu for their leadership and help in shaping this legislation. The \ncoming weeks and months are critical for small businesses. Frankly, it \nis too easy to go to the meetings back home and stand up in front of \nthe small business community and say: Aren't you great; you are 98 \npercent of the businesses of America. You are the engine of our \neconomy.\n  Over 60 percent of America's employees work in small business. Almost \nall the new jobs in America come from small business. Small business \nhas been hurt by the hurricane and by the indirect impact of that \nhurricane on other sectors of our economy. This is an opportunity for \nthe Senate to be able to address those dire needs. I hope my colleagues \nwill join in that effort.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues from \nMassachusetts and Louisiana, Senators Kerry and Landrieu, in support of \nthis amendment to provide assistance to businesses and farmers who are \nfacing serious economic injury from the current run-up in fuel prices.\n  This amendment would establish a 4-year pilot program to provide \nemergency relief through affordable, low-interest Small Business \nAdministration and Department of Agriculture disaster loans to small \nbusinesses and farms harmed by significant increases in the price of \nfuels. Small businesses have narrow operating margins and limited \nreserves to cover unexpected or significant increases in costs, and \ncommercial loans are not available to respond to this kind of \nsituation. Existing disaster loan programs must be expanded so that \nsmall businesses and farms will be able to tap into the capital they \nneed to manage their way through this period of high fuel prices. \nWithout action by the Congress, many small businesses and farms will be \nconfronted with higher costs, reduced profits and likely layoffs.\n  The Senate has this opportunity to reconsider, and again pass, \nlegislation that would provide vital relief. This amendment has enjoyed \nbi-partisan support for several years. I was pleased to be a cosponsor \nwith over 30 colleagues when it was first introduced in the 107th \nCongress as S. 295, and when it was reintroduced in this Congress as S. \n269. Most recently, in June, the Senate passed this measure as section \n303 of the comprehensive energy legislation. Unfortunately, like other \nSenate passed provisions, it ended up on the cutting room floor during \nthe conference with the House. Now, however, the need to assist \nbusinesses and farms that are being injured by skyrocketing fuel prices \nis far greater than it was in June.\n  Businesses in New Mexico have expressed concern about prices and \nurged support for this bill and I know that their experience is shared \nby businesses across the Nation. Last Tuesday, the Energy Committee \nheld hearings on the fuel price crisis and heard sobering testimony \nabout the constraints on oil supply and on the expectation for \nsustained high prices for other fuels as well.\n  I ask that letters from the Albuquerque Hispano Chamber of Commerce \nand from the Los Alamos Chamber of Commerce in support of this \namendment be printed in the Record. I very much appreciate their \nendorsement of this Senate effort to respond\n\n[[Page S10012]]\n\nto the need of small businesses as they struggle with high fuel prices. \nThe catastrophe along the gulf coast has made a bad situation worse, \nand we have a responsibility to provide assistance to those who need a \nway to sustain their businesses during this crisis.\n  I urge my colleagues to again support this amendment, as it was \nsupported in June, so that our businesses and farms will receive the \nassistance they so desperately need.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Albuquerque Hispano\n\n\n                                          Chamber of Commerce,\n\n                              Albuquerque, NM, September 14, 2005.\n     Senator Jeff Bingaman,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: The Albuquerque Hispano Chamber of \n     Commerce (AHCC) is an organization with over thirteen hundred \n     (1,300) smal1 businesses. These small businesses face many \n     challenges on a daily basis to ``keep the shop open.'' Of \n     overwhelming concern are today's spiraling fuel costs.\n       We are writing to express our alarm about the increasing \n     fuel prices and to endorse the Small Business and Farm Energy \n     Emergency Act of 2005, S. 269, which we understand is \n     expected to be offered as an amendment in the U.S. Senate. \n     Many of our members throughout New Mexico are facing a cash \n     flow crisis from high and rapidly increasing prices for \n     gasoline, natural gas, propane and other fuels that are \n     essential to their businesses.\n       Typically, our members have small cash flows, narrow \n     margins, and have very limited reserves to cover unexpected \n     or significant increases in costs. This legislation would \n     establish a 4-year pilot program to provide emergency relief \n     through affordable, low-interest Small Business \n     Administration and Department of Agriculture disaster loans \n     to small businesses and farms harmed by significant increases \n     in the price of fuels. The dramatic increase in the price of \n     gasoline for transportation has compounded the slower but \n     steady increase in natural gas, propane, kerosene and other \n     fuels that are essential to many business operations. It is \n     vital that existing disaster loan programs be expanded so \n     that small businesses and farms will have access to the \n     capital they need to manage these new cost challenges. \n     Commercial loans simply are not available for this type of \n     emergency. Without Federal assistance, many of our members \n     are confronted with curtailing operations, raising prices and \n     suffering declining sales, layoffs, and even bankruptcy.\n       We understand that this emergency loan program was included \n     in the national energy legislation which passed the U.S. \n     Senate earlier this year, but that it was dropped during the \n     conference committee with the House of Representatives. Many \n     of our members face a crises with each new fuel bill and need \n     assistance without further delay. We applaud the Senate's \n     previous effort to get this important bill enacted and urge \n     that you continue to fight for its inclusion in other bills, \n     and its prompt passage into law.\n       Thank you for your continued support for small business and \n     for this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Joseph P.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1665\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are on the Commerce-Justice \nappropriations bill. My understanding is there are a number of \namendments left, one of which is the amendment I have offered. It is an \namendment that is germane, an amendment I expect to have a vote on. I \nknow that amendment has caused quite a lot of consternation on the \nfloor of the Senate in recent hours, also in the Washington Post, and \nnow in a letter from two members of the President's Cabinet, on behalf \nof the President, suggesting that were this amendment to come to his \ndesk in a piece of legislation, they would recommend a veto.\n  This is about trade issues and about whether we are finally, as a \ncountry, going to stand up for this country's economic interests.\n  I only take the floor again to urge those who do not want to have a \nvote on this amendment to relent. We have a right to have a vote. I \nproperly offered this amendment, and I would expect a vote before the \nday is out.\n  The vote is very simple. It is an amendment that says no funding in \nthis appropriations bill can be used by the Commerce Department or the \ntrade ambassador's office to negotiate a trade treaty that reduces or \neliminates the protections that we have in this country to protect \ndomestic producers against unfair trade.\n  I have mentioned before that some years ago I drove to the Canadian \nborder one day with a man named Earl Jensen. Earl had a 12-year-old, 2-\nton orange truck. We drove to the Canadian border with some durum \nwheat. We got to the Canadian border and we were stopped. They said: \nYou can't take American durum wheat into Canada. They stopped us.\n  On the way to the Canadian border, we saw 18-wheelers hauling \nCanadian wheat into our country. We saw truck after truck after truck \nbringing Canadian wheat across the border into our country, and we \ncouldn't get a little old 12-year-old orange truck into Canada with \nabout 150 bushels of durum wheat.\n  What was happening was the Canadian Wheat Board--which is a \nsanctioned monopoly by the Government, which would be illegal in this \ncountry--was selling all that wheat into our country at secret prices, \nundercutting American farmers, engaging in unfair trade, taking money \nstraight out of the pockets of American farmers with unfair trade. You \ncould not do anything about it.\n  We demanded of the Canadian Wheat Board all of the information--the \nmaterials, the data--that defined their sales that they were making at \nsecret prices. We sent the Government Accounting Office, the GAO, up to \nthe Canadian Wheat Board. They thumbed their nose at us and said: We \ndon't intend to give you any of that information. We don't intend to do \nanything that gives you information. Go fly a kite, they said.\n  So year after year after year that unfair trade existed, until \nfinally an action was filed against the Canadians, and some \ncountervailing duties were levied against that wheat coming in as \nunfair trade. Well, that countervailing duty represents a protection we \nhave in our country for farmers, yes, for businesses, for industries--\nprotection against unfair trade by other countries that attempt to \ndestroy a business or destroy an industry in our country by sending in \nproducts that are deeply\n\n[[Page S10013]]\n\nsubsidized or sold at dumped prices in order to injure this country's \neconomy or injure an industry in this country.\n  We have laws against that. The laws are antidumping laws and \ncountervailing duty laws. We have laws that would prohibit another \ncountry from targeting our country with unfair trade. We have a right \nto stand up for our interests and say: You can't do that. That is what \nthese laws are about--countervailing duty laws and antidumping laws.\n  But now there is a new set of trade negotiations occurring in Doha, \nhalfway around the world. They are occurring in secret, and our country \nis involved in them. Our country has indicated, at the demand of other \ncountries, that we will get rid of our protections, such as \ncountervailing duties and antidumping laws. Our country said: OK, we'll \nnegotiate some changes in that.\n  Let me read what this morning's Washington Post has to say. It says:\n\n       The Bush administration agreed to negotiations on U.S. \n     anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws when the latest \n     round of world trade talks was launched in 2001. Many other \n     countries view the measures as an unfair trade barrier and \n     want to discipline U.S. ability to use them.\n\n  In other words, other countries are saying it is unfair we have \nantidumping laws in this country.\n  It is unfair that we have laws that prohibit other countries from \ndumping their products in this country at far below the cost in a way \nthat would endanger U.S. industries and businesses and workers. It is \nunfair, they say. So they want to negotiate an end to those few things \nleft in our trade laws that allow us to protect our own economic \ninterests.\n  The administration, involved in the Doha talks, has said they would \nagree to put all of these things on the table to potentially negotiate \naway our antidumping laws and countervailing duty laws. Rather than the \n$2 language of trade, another way to describe it is to talk about what \nit means to this country and to its workers and businesses. As you \nknow, I have talked at great length about the number of companies that \nhave outsourced their jobs, told their American workers: We don't need \nyou any longer, don't want you, because your jobs are gone. They are \nnow in China or Bangladesh or Sri Lanka or Indonesia or any number of \nother countries where we can hire people for pennies on the dollar and \nnot have to worry about all the nuisances that exist in this country \nwith respect to child labor and safe workplaces and the ability of \nworkers to organize and form a union, and so on.\n  So as companies increasingly move their jobs offshore to other \ncountries, we are engaged more and more in unfair trade practices \nagainst our country, and our trade negotiators are willing to negotiate \naway the last vestiges of protection we have.\n  From the Washington Post:\n\n       The Bush administration urged the Senate on Tuesday to \n     reject an amendment they said would cripple chances of \n     reaching a new World Trade Agreement.\n       The measure . . . is aimed at preventing U.S. trade \n     negotiators from agreeing to change any laws that allow the \n     United States to impose duties against unfairly priced or \n     subsidized imports.\n\n  The trade ambassador says:\n\n       We strongly urge the Senate to reject this unwise \n     amendment.\n       The provision would ``provide our trading partners an \n     excuse to refuse to negotiate on sectors and subjects they \n     consider sensitive'' and greatly diminish our chances of \n     reaching an ambitious world trade deal.\n\n  I am not particularly interested in anybody reaching a deal if the \ndeal is not fair to this country. The objective of negotiating is not \nto negotiate a deal, if a deal is not fair to us. It doesn't matter \nwhether you are talking about GATT, United States-Canada, NAFTA, CAFTA, \nat the end of the day, our trade negotiations in the last 25 years have \nleft this country in a weaker position and have put this country in a \nposition where our jobs are leaving this country. I am not interested \nin a trade deal unless it represents this country's best interests.\n  It is time for this country to understand that trade agreements must \nbe mutually beneficial. This week, to a giant yawn in the Senate \nChamber, there was an announcement that we had the fifth highest trade \ndeficit in the history of our country. It was only $58 billion for a \nmonth. Did that create a traffic jam for people to come to the Chamber \nto say: Maybe we ought to stare truth in the eye and deal with this \nissue? No. It wouldn't interrupt any naps around here. Nobody cares \nabout trade. Nobody cares about jobs. Nobody wearing blue suits is \ngoing to lose their job because politicians don't get outsourced; it is \njust workers. They are the ones who come home and say: Honey, I lost my \njob. I worked there 20 years and did a great job, but they have told me \nmy job is now going to India. And by the way, I am going to train the \nperson in India that works my job because they are bringing them over \nto get training from me. Then I am done.\n  My only purpose for offering this amendment is to say that at some \npoint this country might want to stand up for its own economic \ninterests, for its farmers, businessmen, and workers. It has not done \nthat. I am anxious to have a discussion about how anybody in this \nChamber thinks it advances our interests to go to Doha and, in secret, \nnegotiate an agreement that would weaken the protections we have for \nour producers to require competition in trade be fair. I wish to have a \ndiscussion or a debate with anybody in the Senate who thinks that is a \ngood deal for this country. I don't know. Maybe we have become immune \nto the news when in a month our trade deficit is $57 billion, $59 \nbillion, $55 billion. Our trade deficit with China alone in a month is \n$16, $17, $18 billion. Every single day we buy $2 billion more from \nabroad than we send abroad, 365 days a year.\n  You can make a case, if you are an economist with real tiny glasses \nand not much breadth of thought, that the budget deficit and our budget \nis what we owe to ourselves. You can make that case. You cannot make a \nsimilar case with respect to the trade deficit. That is a deficit that \nwe owe to others outside of this country. Those are claims against \nAmerican assets. It is what Warren Buffett, a businessman I hugely \nadmire, calls creating an economy of sharecroppers.\n  It is fascinating to me that somehow we are told there is a doctrine \nof comparative advantage with respect to the Chinese, which is our \nlargest trading partner in terms of the deficit. We have a huge deficit \nwith China that is likely now to reach close to $200 billion in 1 year. \nWhat is the comparative advantage? Is it a natural economic advantage \nsuch as the Portuguese and English trading wool or wine? No. The \nadvantage is, you can hire somebody for 33 cents an hour, work them 7 \ndays a week, 12 hours a day. If they complain, you can throw them in \njail. And if they try to form a labor union, you can fire them first, \nthen throw them in prison. That is the advantage. The advantage is \nborne on the backs of workers.\n  We are not exporting enough product because we are importing $2 \nbillion a day more than we are exporting. What we are exporting is \nmisery, the misery of people who are working in circumstances where \nthey don't have a voice. They are fired if they attempt to form a labor \nunion. They work in unsafe plants. They work 7 days a week and they are \npaid pennies an hour. That is the export of misery.\n  I didn't intend to speak at great length about this. The \nadministration has written a letter saying, through Rob Portman, trade \nambassador, and Carlos Gutierrez, the Secretary of Commerce:\n\n       We and other senior advisors will recommend to the \n     President that he veto this legislation if the Dorgan \n     amendment were included.\n\n  God forbid that we should include an amendment that stands up for \nthis country's economic interests.\n  All of these folks have painted these wonderful mosaics with respect \nto trade agreements, whether it is CAFTA or any of the others. After \neach single trade agreement, our trade deficit has increased, and the \nnumber of American jobs lost, the number of American jobs moving \noverseas has increased. You would think at some point just by chance \nthe Congress would decide, this doesn't make any sense. At some point \nwhen you see things don't work, you probably decide you might want to \nreevaluate them. Not this Congress. In fact, if something is not \nworking, this Congress says: Let's do a lot more of it. It is like the \nold story about the guy hauling coal. He is losing money so he\n\n[[Page S10014]]\n\nstarts hauling a lot more coal. That is the attitude of this Congress: \nIt doesn't matter, $700 billion a year in deficits. Let's do some more. \nLet's send our guy to Doha.\n  It is interesting. Why do you think trade negotiations are going on \nin Doha? Why not London or Paris or New York? Why in Doha in secret? \nBecause if they had these trade negotiations in London, Paris or New \nYork, the streets would be jammed with protesters. So they go to Doha \nand have a negotiation that is in secret, and they come back and tell \nus--with fast track, so that you can't offer any amendments--here is \nwhat we negotiated behind that closed door. Like it or lump it; you \ncan't change it.\n\n  This is now a new world order. It is going to affect our country in a \nlot of ways. It won't affect anybody wearing blue serge suits, just \nworkers. If workers lose their jobs and those jobs are sent overseas, \nthat is part of the advancement of an enlightened economy.\n  This is not enlightenment, not after you work for 100 years, to \ndecide that you want to create a standard by which people can live \nwell, work, get paid a decent wage, work in a safe workplace, have job \nprotection, the ability to organize, and then negotiate all of that \naway which is exactly what is happening.\n  I mentioned yesterday James Fyler. I probably shouldn't have said: \nJames Fyler died of lead poisoning. He was shot 55 times. James Fyler \nwas a labor organizer, and he lost his life for trying to organize for \nrights of workers. That was in 1914. Over a long period of time, we \nfinally made progress and decided there are conditions of production \nwith respect to the environment and workers and other things that make \nsense. And now all of a sudden, once we have established those rules, \nyou can avoid all those rules as a company by pole-vaulting over them \nto India or China and deciding: That is where I am producing because I \ndon't have to put up with all this nuisance such as not being able to \nhire kids or having to pay a livable wage or having to put up with \nworkers that want to organize with respect to workers' rights.\n  I mentioned yesterday how much I admired liked Lech Walesa. He was \nthe fellow in Poland who took down a Communist Government, leading \nworkers' rights strikes in the country of Poland. We deeply admired \nhim. Maybe we ought to stand up for similar issues in other parts of \nthe world on economic matters. Maybe once we ought to decide that our \nreal role is to bring others up, not push us down. That is why I offer \nthis amendment.\n  I know there are plenty of people who feel very strongly that I am \ndead wrong about this, but they are not supported by the facts. All of \nthe evidence is opposed to it working. There isn't anyone who can come \nto this heir argument that the current trade strategy is floor and tell \nme that a strategy that produces $700 billion a year in trade deficits, \n$2 billion a day in trade deficits, somehow works to the advantage of \nthis country. It does not. It weakens America. We will not long remain \na world economic power unless we have a strong manufacturing base and \ndecide to stand up for the standards we fought for, for a century, that \ncreated a broad middle class that represented the purchasing power to \nmove America forward. That is what so many forget.\n  Mr. President, I wish to make one other point. The amendment is \nnearly identical to the amendment offered by Senator Dayton and Senator \nCraig when we had fast track before the Senate, and it received 61 \nvotes. It passed the Senate, though it was dropped in conference. That \nis why I assume they do not want to vote on this amendment today. They \nworry they will lose the vote in the Senate.\n  My hope is they will understand that I have timely filed this \namendment. It is germane. I have a right to a vote. I insist on a vote. \nAnd I believe it is the only conceivable way we can finally begin to \nchange this country's trade policies and tell trade negotiators they \ncannot get into an airplane, fly halfway around the world, shut the \ndoor of the room in which they are going to negotiate, and negotiate \naway protections of American businesses and workers who demand fair \ntrade. They cannot do that. We will not allow them to do that.\n  I say to the leadership on the other side, I hope they will now come \nback and have a vote on my amendment this afternoon. Win or lose, I \nfeel passionately that this country needs to speak about this issue and \ndo so in support of this country's economic interests.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we know the country has been hit by the \ncatastrophe of Katrina. We know hundreds of lives have been lost. We \nknow tens of billions of dollars of property damage has been done. We \nknow there are thousands of people who have been displaced, who are \nwithout their homes. We know there is widespread devastation across an \nentire region of the country. We know the insurance losses to the \ncountry apparently approach $100 billion. We also know enormous damage \nhas been done to our budget situation with the Federal Government.\n  I thought this was perhaps an appropriate time to come to the floor \nto talk about the changes in our budget situation and the implications \nfor the future and how important it is that we begin to focus on the \ndamage that has been done to our fiscal condition and to begin the \nprocess of thinking through what our response will be. Are we going to \nstay with the same plan that was in place before, or are we going to \nrecognize a new reality and move to a different plan and hopefully \nsteer the country back to some fiscal course that has better long-term \nprospects?\n  We know, putting in perspective before Katrina, where things stood; \nthat we faced in this country very large deficits in historical terms. \nWe go back to 2001, when we actually enjoyed a surplus of $128 billion, \nand each year since that time, the deficits have grown to record \nproportion. In 2004, the deficit reached a record level of $412 \nbillion. The estimates for 2005, before Katrina, were $331 billion, \nstill an enormous deficit, and in many ways it understates the \nseriousness of our fiscal condition because, as the occupant of the \nchair knows very well, the budget deficit is a more conservative look \nat how serious our situation is in the sense that it understates what \nis actually happening because the amount of the increase in the debt of \nour country is far greater than the reported deficit.\n  I find there is a lot of confusion on that as I go around my State. \nPeople think the amount of the deficit is what gets added to the debt, \nbut that is not the case. What is added to the debt is much greater. In \nfact, we anticipate now that the debt will increase in 2005, not by \n$331 billion, but now with Katrina, well over $600 billion.\n  We now know Katrina has absorbed already $62.3 billion of additional \nspending. We were last told that the Federal Government was spending \nabout $2 billion a day in response to Katrina, truly a stunning amount \nof money. That is over and above all other Federal expenditures. And \nthis $62.3 billion is just a downpayment.\n  There was a report in the Wall Street Journal that the first \nestimates on Katrina costs for Washington hit $200 billion. This is in \na story that just appeared on September 7. The lead says:\n\n       The Federal Government could spend as much as $150 billion \n     to $200 billion caring for the victims of Hurricane Katrina \n     and rebuilding from its devastation, according to early \n     congressional estimates--a total bill that would far surpass \n     the initial costs of recovering from the 9/11 terror attacks \n     and could put Katrina on track to become the most expensive \n     natural disaster in American history.\n\n  None of us begrudge spending this money to help the victims. We all \nunderstand that is a Federal obligation, a tragedy of such sweeping \ndimension that it requires a full Federal response. But we need to \nevaluate these enormous expenditures in light of the very deep deficit \nditch we are already in in this country, a deficit ditch that is only \nexceeded by the debt ditch that is being dug by the policies that are \nbeing pursued in Washington.\n  I think all of us who have been engaged in these debates know how \nserious the long-term outlook is. To evaluate what has happened in the \npast so\n\n[[Page S10015]]\n\nthat we better understand our future, I wanted to go back to 2001. \nAfter the 2000 elections, the 2001 Congressional Budget Office, looking \nahead, told us this was the range of possible outcomes for the budget \ngoing forward. This would be a projection on what the surpluses might \nlook like going forward. They picked this midrange going forward.\n  They were projecting surpluses. That was the long-term outlook. The \nCongressional Budget Office, the Office of Management and Budget, told \nus we could expect something like $6 trillion in surpluses over the \nnext 10 years at that time. I remember many of my colleagues told me \nrepeatedly, when I urged them not to be betting on this 10-year \nforecast: Kent, you are being much too conservative.\n  Do you not understand that when we have these tax cuts, we will get \nmuch more revenue? We will not be at the midline of this range of \npossible outcomes. Instead, we will be significantly above it because \nif you cut taxes, the theory was there is going to be more money.\n  Well, we can go back now and look at what actually occurred, not what \nsome ideological slogan predicted, but what actually occurred in the \nreal world. In the real world what happened with deficits is this red \nline. It is far below the bottom of the projections that were made by \nthe Congressional Budget Office. Not only did we not achieve the \nmidpoint of the range, nor anywhere close to that, we were not even at \nthe bottom of the range of possible outcomes. We are far below the \nbottom. So the theory that if we cut taxes, we get more revenue and \nthis would all work out has not worked very well in the real world.\n  That can be seen if we look at the revenue line in historical \nperspective. This is the revenue line going back to 1959 as a \npercentage of our gross domestic product. The economists say that is \nthe best way to look at it because that takes out the effects of \ninflation year to year. Look what we see. Revenue was almost 21 percent \nof GDP in 2000. The President at the time said revenue is very high \nhistorically, and he was exactly right, revenue was high historically. \nHis answer was to cut taxes. But look at what has happened. Revenue in \n2004 was 16.3 percent of GDP, the lowest it has been since 1959. So \nonce again, the notion that if we cut taxes we are going to get more \nrevenue did not work. We cut taxes repeatedly and revenue has \ncollapsed. The result is the gap between spending and revenue has once \nagain opened up and is producing massive budget deficits.\n  If we look ahead, it is all too predictable where we are headed. The \nadministration earlier said they are going to cut the deficit in half \nover 5 years, but they got that result by leaving things out. They left \nout the full effect of war costs. They left out the cost of fixing the \nalternative minimum tax, which costs $700 billion to fix. The \nalternative minimum tax is the old millionaires' tax. It is now a \nmiddle-class tax trap. The alternative minimum tax affected 3 million \npeople this year. Ten years from now it is going to affect 30 million \npeople if we do not respond. So, of course, we are going to respond. We \nmust respond. But it costs money and the money is not in the budget, \njust as war costs passed September 30 are not in the budget.\n  When these things are put back in, what one sees is a much different \noutlook going forward, and this is before Katrina. I want to emphasize \nthis is before Katrina. What we see is a deficit picture that gets much \nworse, especially after this 5-year budget window. The budget the \nPresident submitted was for 5 years. Previously we had been doing 10-\nyear budgets. I think one reason the President changed to 5 years is \nbecause we see the deterioration that is going to occur if the \nPresident's budget proposals are adopted, because the President is \nsaying, spend more money but cut the revenue base as well. In fact, he \nis proposing over $1.5 trillion of additional tax cuts.\n  If we do a reality test, I think we have to ask ourselves the \nquestion, where is this all headed? We cannot pay our bills now. We are \nrunning near-record deficits. Spending is exploding. Sixty billion \ndollars has been appropriated to Katrina alone in the last few days. \nThe President says, cut the revenue base by $1.5 trillion. Most of that \ncut will occur beyond the 5-year budget window, and this is before the \nbaby boomers retire. What possible sense does this policy make?\n  We have before us a budget plan that makes the situation worse. The \nbudget itself will increase the debt $600 billion a year every year for \nthe next 5 years, and I will discuss that in the next chart. In \naddition to the budget plan, there is a plan called reconciliation, a \nprocess of fast-tracking legislation that was supposed to be used to \nreduce the deficit. In passing their budget this year, our colleagues \ndecided to use that fast-track process to actually increase the \ndeficit. Why? Because they have $35 billion of spending cuts over the \nlife of the budget but they have $70 billion of revenue cuts. The \nresult is the deficit is increased. The debt is increased--not reduced, \nbut increased.\n\n  When one looks at the budget that was passed in the Senate and \nultimately passed in the House and then passed both Chambers, what one \nsees is the debt of the country going up dramatically before Katrina. \nThe debt was going to go up over $600 billion a year each and every \nyear of the budget that was passed.\n  I know it is hard to believe, but these are the numbers in the budget \ndocument itself. In the budget document itself, their prediction of \nwhat will happen to the debt of the country shows that the debt will go \nup $683 billion this year. That is not the deficit, it is the increase \nin the debt of the country. Very often I find people are confused \nbetween the deficit and the debt. I think we should be focusing at this \nmoment on the debt because that captures the money that is being taken \nfrom Social Security and all the other trust funds, money that has to \nbe paid back, but there is no plan to pay it back.\n  The debt is going to increase under the plan of the budget that is \nbefore us, before Katrina, $683 billion this year; $639 billion the \nnext year; $606 billion the third year; $610 billion the fourth year; \n$605 billion the fifth year.\n  There has been some improvement in this year, more than $50 billion \nof improvement from when this budget resolution was drafted. But, \nagain, that is before Katrina. That improvement this year has been \nwiped out next year by the two legislative acts we have passed so far \nto deal with Katrina, over $60 billion in those two, with much more to \ncome.\n  So we are right back in this neighborhood of increasing the debt by \nthese massive amounts. What is most alarming is this increase in debt \nis occurring in the sweet spot of the budget cycle, before the baby \nboomers retire. When the baby boomers retire, then we see the real \nchallenge begin. To look visually at what is happening to the debt, I \nprepared this chart because I think it communicates about as well as I \ncan how we are building a wall of debt. The gross debt of the United \nStates at the end of this year is estimated to be $7.9 trillion. One \ncan see, with the course we are on, that debt is going to be jumping by \n$600 billion, some of these years more than $600 billion, each and \nevery year for the next 5 years; massive increases in debt. At a time \nthe President told us if we adopted his plan back in 2001, one will \nrecall he said there is going to be maximum paydown of the debt. Do we \nsee any paydown of the debt occurring? No paydown of the debt. The debt \nis skyrocketing.\n  There is not much interest in this town, or perhaps elsewhere, about \nthis problem. But there will be. I predict there will be because, one, \nthe markets cannot be fooled; reality cannot be fooled. The reality is, \nwe are going deeper and deeper into hock.\n  Who are we going into hock to? Well, increasingly we are going into \ndebt with other countries around the world. We owe Japan over $680 \nbillion. We owe China over $240 billion. We owe the United Kingdom over \n$140 billion. My favorite is the Caribbean banking centers. We owe the \nCaribbean banking centers over $100 billion. I like to ask audiences \nback home if anyone is doing business with the Caribbean banking \ncenters. I have never had a hand go up. I do not know where the \nCaribbean banking centers get their money, but we owe them $108 \nbillion.\n  The debt is skyrocketing at the worst possible time, before the baby \nboomers start to retire. Because this debt is skyrocketing, we owe more \nand more countries around the world. In\n\n[[Page S10016]]\n\nthe last 4 years alone, foreign holdings of our debt have increased \nmore than 100 percent. Think about that. Other countries' holding of \ndebt has gone up more than 100 percent in 4 years. That is utterly \nunsustainable. It has taken us over 200 years to build up a debt around \nthe world and we have doubled it in the last 4. That is not a \nsustainable circumstance.\n  Couple that with the trade deficit--the trade deficit running over \n$600 billion a year--it seems to me it is very clear that as a country \nwe are living beyond our means.\n  There are real consequences to doing so. Here is the pattern of \nSocial Security beneficiaries. Of course, the same chart would apply to \nMedicare. We are just below 40 million people now eligible. By 2050, \nthere are going to be 81 million. This is the demographic tsunami that \nis headed our way, and it is going to swamp a lot of boats. Our country \nhas to get ready. We have to respond.\n  The biggest long-term problem we have is not with Social Security. \nSocial Security's 75-year shortfall is estimated at $4 trillion. I \npersonally do not believe that. I think that overstates the shortfall \nin Social Security. Why? Because this is based on an assumption. The \nshortfall in Social Security is based on an assumption that the economy \nis only going to grow 1.9 percent a year every year for the next 75 \nyears. In the past 75 years, the economy has grown at 3.4 percent a \nyear. If the economy were to grow in the future as it has in the past, \n80 percent of this shortfall would disappear.\n  Does that mean we do not have a problem? No. I wish it did, but we \nhave a big problem. The problem we have, as I diagnose it, is first of \nall those very large budget deficits we are running now, coupled with \nthe shortfall in Medicare, which is seven times the projected shortfall \nin Social Security. This is the real 800-pound gorilla: Medicare--a \nshortfall of almost $30 trillion estimated over the next 75 years. This \nshortfall, I believe, is much more likely to come true than the \nprojected shortfall in Social Security because it is based not only on \nan aging population but medical inflation that is running far ahead of \nthe underlying rate of inflation.\n  If you put it all together, we have massive budget deficits made much \nmore severe by the war in Iraq and Afghanistan that is adding $6 to $8 \nbillion a month; coupled with Katrina, who knows what the ultimate cost \nwill be? It is at least $60 billion and counting. And then we have \nthese massive long-term shortfalls, especially in Medicare.\n  Then I look at the President's plan. The President says: Steady as \nshe goes. Spend the money, but on top of it add massive additional tax \ncuts, tax cuts that are represented by these red bars, tax cuts that \nexplode at the very time the Social Security and Medicare trust funds \ngo cash negative. There can only be one possible result, and that is \nmassive red ink, massive deficits, massive debt--a completely \nunsustainable situation.\n  It is not enough to curse the darkness. We also have to talk about \nwhat can be done here to begin to dig out. I believe on the revenue \nside of the equation, before we talk about any tax increase for \nanybody, we ought to talk about this tax gap. That is the difference \nbetween what is owed and what is being paid. It is estimated now \nconservatively at over $350 billion a year.\n  The vast majority of us pay what we owe; companies do, individuals \ndo. But increasingly there are people and companies that do not. They \nnow estimate that amounts to $350 billion a year of lost revenue. That \nis utterly unfair to the rest of us who are paying what we owe, and we \nought to insist that everybody pay what they owe. If we could do that, \nwe would close this yawning chasm by some significant amount--nobody \nknows quite how much. On the revenue side of the equation, I believe \nthat ought to be our first order of business.\n  On the spending side of the equation, the first order of business \nought to be to focus on Medicare and the 5 percent of beneficiaries who \nuse 50 percent of the money. Five percent of the people use 50 percent \nof the money. They are the chronically ill. What can we do about it? \nWhat we can do is focus like a laser on those who are the chronically \nill and better coordinate their care.\n  A pilot problem was done with 22,000 patients like that; assign \nnurse-practitioners to every one of those cases to better coordinate \ntheir care. The first thing they did was lay out the prescription drugs \nthe patients were taking, and they found in many of the cases they were \ntaking 16 prescription drugs, and they found in many cases half of them \nthey should not be taking or didn't need to take.\n  I did this with my own father-in-law. I went into his home when he \nwas ill. Sure enough, he was taking 16 prescription drugs. I got on the \nphone to the doctor and I went down the list. About the third drug I \nlisted, the doctor said to me: He should not be taking that. He should \nnot have been taking that for the last 3 years. I went further down the \nlist. About two other drugs, the doctor said to me: He should never be \ntaking those two together. They work against each other.\n  By the time we were done, we had eliminated 8 of the 16 prescription \ndrugs he was taking. I said to the doctor: How does this happen? The \ndoctor said to me: You know, it happens all the time. He said: I am the \nfamily practice doctor. He has a heart doctor, he has a lung doctor, he \nhas an orthopedic doctor. He is getting prescription drugs at the \nhospital clinic, the corner clinic, the clinic down at the beach, and \nhe is getting them mail order. He is sick and confused. His wife is \nsick and confused. The result is chaos.\n  All too often, that is what is happening. When we put nurse \npractitioners on the 22,000 chronically ill cases that were studied, \nthey reduced hospitalization 40 percent, they reduced costs 20 percent, \nand they got better health care outcomes because they got people to \nstop taking drugs they should not be taking. They got them to stop \nhaving duplicate medical tests that didn't have any value but to put \nthem through more stressful procedures. We ought to take that study on \n22,000 and we ought to ramp it up to a quarter of a million or \nsomething like that and see if we could get those same results on a \nmuch bigger universe and see if we could continue to save money and get \nbetter health care outcomes.\n\n  Those are just two ideas, closing the tax gap and dealing with the \ntremendous explosion in costs in Medicare where, again, 5 percent of \nthe people are using half of the entire budget. We ought to focus like \na laser on that half of the expenditure, and we ought to do it quickly. \nThe sooner we act on these problems and challenges, the better off we \nare. The longer we stay with our heads in the sand, the more Draconian \nwill have to be the solution.\n  Katrina was a disaster of unparalleled dimension. All of us weep for \nthose who have lost family members and friends. We are saddened by the \nother losses that have occurred as well. But we should not compound the \nproblem by sticking with a fiscal plan that puts this country deeper \nand deeper into the deficit and debt ditch. That would add to the \ncalamity. That would compound the disaster.\n  We ought to take this opportunity to begin to plan how we dig out. It \nis imperative that we act sooner rather than later. It is imperative \nthat the Congress and the President begin a plan to put us back on a \nmore sound fiscal footing. It would truly be ironic if this disaster \nwere allowed to spread to an even deeper fiscal disaster, one that \ncould cause the harm of Katrina to spread outside the Gulf region to \nevery part of our country.\n  I am very hopeful that the President will provide leadership and that \nCongress will respond. If the President does not provide leadership, \nthe Congress should demonstrate leadership and take this bull by the \nhorns and recognize we need a new fiscal blueprint for this country. We \nneed to start digging out of this deficit ditch and prepare a brighter \nand better future for our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            KATRINA TAX BILL\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, at the outset, let me praise my colleague \nfrom North Dakota for his wisdom and his leadership in addressing an \nissue this Nation has forgotten for too long a time; that is, the \nnotion of fiscal responsibility and the fact that the\n\n[[Page S10017]]\n\nUnited States of America today finds itself in a fiscal ditch. How we \naddress the fiscal challenges of our future will largely depend on his \nleadership and the leadership of our colleagues in the Senate to make \nsure the legacy we pass on to our children is not a legacy of debt that \nwill hang around their necks for generations to come. I appreciate the \nleadership of Senator Conrad from North Dakota.\n  Last week I stood before the Senate and said that Congress needed to \ntake a three-pronged approach to responding to the devastation brought \nto this Nation by Hurricane Katrina. That three-pronged response, from \nmy perspective, required us to do as much as we could to save lives and \nmake sure we were responsive to the victims of Hurricane Katrina; \nsecond, we needed to move forward with a Gulf Coast recovery plan to \nhelp that part of our Nation recover; and finally, we needed to move \nforward to address the lessons to be learned from this horrific \ndevastation of a great part of our Nation.\n  On the first step, this Congress has taken steps in rushing billions \nof dollars in emergency funding to the Gulf Coast. That funding should \nhelp the victims of Katrina begin their long road to recovery.\n  On the second step, it is my hope that Congress and the President of \nthe United States will move forward and embrace a Gulf Coast recovery \nplan. As the minority leader has stated over the last several days, we \nneed to have a mini-Marshall Plan that runs the program which will \ninvest billions and billions of dollars in an effort to try to recover \nthe 90,000 square miles of land that were devastated by Hurricane \nKatrina.\n  I commend my colleagues from Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and \nthroughout the country. They have been working on developing a plan. \nThey are showing true leadership and taking the primary role in getting \nassistance to their States. I am working with them and sharing my ideas \nwith them.\n  I believe a Gulf Coast recovery plan should, in fact, be created and \nannounced soon. That Gulf Coast recovery should require a plan to be \ndeveloped for the reconstruction of the Gulf Coast. It should identify \nthe costs that will be associated with the implementation of that plan, \nand it should oversee its successful implementation. Finally and very \nimportant, that plan should minimize the corruption and waste that \nmight occur where there are billions upon billions of dollars that are \nbeing spent in this recovery effort where much of that money is being \nallocated through noncompetitive bids.\n  Third, I strongly believe it is important for us as a United States \nof America to move forward to learn the lessons from this devastation. \nThe independent commission that has been proposed by my colleagues in \nthis body should, in fact, be embraced by the President of the United \nStates and this Nation. When we look at what happened with respect to \nthe devastation from Hurricane Katrina, it is clear to me, as a person \nwho for much of the last decade of my life served as attorney general \nof the great State of Colorado, that our Nation and our Government \nfailed to protect the lives of people, to protect people and their \nfamilies, and to protect their property.\n  It is elemental with any kind of emergency preparedness effort that \nwe must be ready for any emergency that occurs. We must respond to an \nemergency that occurs, and we must recover from that emergency. It is \nbeyond dispute that this Nation failed with respect to the effort to be \nready to address the issues of Hurricane Katrina, and once Hurricane \nKatrina made landfall we failed again to provide the kind of response \nthat our National Government should have in fact responded.\n  We need to have this investigation occur so that we can learn the \ntruth and learn the lessons. We need to know why, when the Governor of \nLouisiana declared a disaster emergency on Friday the 26th of August, \nit took up to 3 days until President Bush declared the area a disaster \narea. Why did it take 3 days for that to occur? Why did it take 4 days \nfor the Department of Homeland Security to declare Katrina an incident \nof national significance--4 days for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to declare Katrina an incident of national significance--5 \ndays before National Guard troops arrived in significant numbers, and 6 \ndays before FEMA took over the evacuation of New Orleans?\n  These are important questions we need to ask. We need to have some \nanswers to these questions.\n  The resignation of FEMA Director Michael Brown is a step in the right \ndirection.\n  I also applaud President Bush for taking personal responsibility for \nthe Federal Government's failure in this arena.\n  Congress now needs to move forward with a full bipartisan \ninvestigation into what went wrong. We did it when the 9/11 Commission \nwas created in this Congress and in this Senate. The results of that \nCommission are now being implemented.\n  We hope the administration and the majority leadership in the Senate \nwill change their minds and support legislation to create an \nindependent Katrina commission.\n  Over the last week, we have seen the terrible toll of the worst \nnatural disaster in our Nation's history. The images of devastation and \nhuman loss will haunt all of us, and the emerging statistics of the \nscope of this disaster are overwhelming and continue to date. One \nmillion people have been displaced from their homes.\n  I sometimes think about the town that was nearest to the ranch where \nI grew up. The place matters in perspective. My town had 1,000 people \nand probably about 400 residences within that town.\n  We are talking about 1 million--one-fourth the population of the \nState of Colorado--displaced from their homes because of Hurricane \nKatrina. More than 500 people have been confirmed dead, and we yet are \ncounting additional casualties and will not know the final number \nperhaps for weeks.\n  With the more than 200 people who died in Mississippi, the more than \n200 people who died in Louisiana, or the people who died in Alabama and \nFlorida--the fact is that their deaths should not be deaths in vain; \nthat we should learn from the hurt of this Nation, from their loss of \nlife.\n  Eighty percent of New Orleans is still underwater today, and much of \nthe Gulf Coast is in tatters. The recovery pricetag--who knows what \nthat may be. Many people are saying the ultimate pricetag for both the \nresponse and the recovery will exceed $200 billion.\n  Yet spread among this despair and destruction we have seen many \ninstances of the greatness of heroism examples of Americans. The great \nState of Colorado is no exception. Colorado's emergency workers are on \nthe ground on the Gulf Coast participating in the rescue and cleanup \nefforts and assisting evacuees.\n  Just this week, two firefighters from Centennial, CO, helped rescue a \nfamily of four still stuck in their home in New Orleans. Coloradans, \nlike Americans throughout the Nation, have donated tons of supplies, \nmillions of dollars, and thousands of volunteer hours to Katrina \nrelief. Coloradans by themselves have already given more than $6 \nmillion to the American Red Cross.\n  That is a spirit of generosity and a spirit of community that is \nfundamental to this Nation.\n  Colorado has already accepted 1,000 evacuees to the Denver area. To \nprepare for their arrival, volunteers scrapped Labor Day plans and \nscrambled to clean and outfit the old Lowry Air Force Base barracks. \nSince the evacuees arrived, volunteers helped serve food, pass out \ndonated clothes, and drive evacuees around to complete chores.\n  These examples give us great hope and resolve to begin the long \nprocess of rebuilding the millions of broken lives and hearts on the \nGulf Coast.\n  The American people and their generosity and bravery are the \nstrongest tools we have to help our countrymen and women recover from \nHurricane Katrina.\n  To that end, I will today introduce a piece of legislation to nurture \nthat American spirit of generosity and enable more Americans to \ncontribute to the hurricane effort.\n  The first thing the legislation I will introduce will do is help \nfolks who have generously taken in hurricane survivors into their \nhomes, and to be able to do so in a manner that provides them a tax \nbenefit.\n  According to the Department of Homeland Security, 248,000-plus \nevacuees are staying at 774 shelters across\n\n[[Page S10018]]\n\nthe country. This figure underscores the fact that more than 700,000 \nevacuees are staying elsewhere. An estimated hundreds of thousands of \nhurricane victims are staying in private homes. In Colorado, at least \n600 hurricane victims are staying in private homes. They are staying \nwith family and friends, and sometimes even with strangers.\n  Right now, a person who writes a check to the Red Cross can get a tax \ndeduction. But people who open up their homes to victims, feed them and \nhelp them, do not get a similar tax deduction. That generosity should \nnot be penalized in any way.\n  My bill would offer a tax credit of a simple $20 per day to help Good \nSamaritans cover the cost of feeding and keeping evacuees in their \nhomes. That is $20 a day to help Good Samaritans cover the cost of \nfeeding and keeping evacuees in their homes. Households that take in an \nevacuee would be able to claim up to $900 in tax relief. Households \nthat take in more than one hurricane victim would be eligible for up to \n$2,000 in tax relief. And low-income families who have no tax liability \nwould be able to receive up to $500 in a refundable tax credit to help \ntake care of hurricane victims. This assistance wouldn't cover all the \ncosts of lending a helping hand, but it would recognize the sacrifice \nand generosity of folks who open their homes and hearts to Katrina \nsurvivors, and they should be applauded by our Nation.\n  The second thing my bill would do is to raise the limit of charitable \ncontributions for Katrina relief. Right now, the amount of tax \ndeduction an individual can get for charitable contributions is limited \nto 50 percent of the person's adjusted gross income. My bill would lift \nthe limit for 4 years to allow individuals who can give more to do so.\n  Americans are aching to help, and this provision would allow them to \ndo just that, and even more. Senators Grassley, Baucus, chairman and \nranking members of the Finance Committee, have developed a package of \ntax incentives to help victims of Hurricane Katrina. I applaud them for \ntheir efforts. Their bill also touches on these two issues of offering \nassistance to households who house victims and extend caps on \ncharitable giving. I commend them for tackling the issue, and I am glad \nto work with them to include these provisions.\n  My bill is slightly different in that it offers good neighbors a more \ngenerous tax credit as opposed to a tax deduction, and lowers the \nbarriers to low-income families to get help.\n  We have many challenges ahead, but because we have witnessed the \nbravery, generosity, and ingenuity of the American people, I am \nconfident that the gulf coast's best days are still ahead.\n  I will introduce my bill later today. I urge my colleagues to support \nthe bill and take a small step to nurture and encourage the best part \nof the American spirit and American generosity.\n\n\n                        The Pledge of Allegiance\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I also wanted to take a minute to address \nan issue concerning a decision that was handed down by a Federal \ndistrict judge concerning the Pledge of Allegiance--a decision of the \ndistrict court judge in San Francisco in which he determined that it \nwas unconstitutional for the public schools to recite the Pledge of \nAllegiance in the classroom because of the reference it makes to ``one \nnation under God.''\n  He declared that decision to be one that was founded on his view that \nsuch a requirement in our public schools was unconstitutional and in \nviolation of the first amendment. I disagree with the finding of the \ndistrict court judge.\n  Last year, as attorney general for Colorado, I joined many of my \ncolleagues, both Democrat and Republican, in making an argument to the \nU.S. Supreme Court and to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that, in \nfact, it was constitutional for us to allow our children to recite the \nPledge of Allegiance, and to use the term ``under God'' in that \nrecitation in our schools.\n  I believe the Ninth Circuit decision back in 2002 was wrong, and I \nbelieve the district court judge's decision today is also wrong.\n  I will later today write a letter to Attorney General Gonzales asking \nhim to participate in behalf of the United States in the appeal of the \nFederal district court judge's decision, again to the Ninth Circuit, \nand hopefully up to the U.S. Supreme Court so that we can get a final \ndetermination on this issue concerning the Pledge of Allegiance and how \nit is recited in our public schools.\n  In my own reading of the Constitution, and joined by most of my \ncolleagues on both the Democratic and the Republican sides of the aisle \nduring the time that I was attorney general, it was our conclusion \nthat, in fact, the Pledge of Allegiance could be recited and that the \nreference ``one nation under God'' was, in fact, in keeping with the \nconstitutional requirements of the first amendment.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1695\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I understand we are currently \nconsidering the Kerry-Landrieu amendment to the CJS appropriations \nbill. We have been considering amendments to this important bill all \nday in light of the devastation and tremendous challenge that is before \nthe Nation right now to help rebuild our gulf coast area and \nparticularly the southeastern part of the State I have the great \nprivilege and honor of representing.\n  I understand there are various different opinions from the Republican \nside and the Democratic side about what to do and how much to do and \nwhen to do it regarding either communications or housing or health care \nor education. I understand a lot of those details are being worked out \nas we debate on the floor.\n  In a spirit, though, of bipartisanship, I do come to the floor to \nurge special consideration for this particular amendment. Believe me, \nthere are so many amendments to this bill I have voted for today and \nwish we could have adopted. But the reason I feel particularly strongly \nabout this amendment is because small business is the heart and soul \nand strength of the economy in Louisiana, in the gulf coast region, \nand, as a matter of fact, throughout the Nation. I do not think we \nrealize that. We say it, but I do not think we really believe it. So I \nthought I would come to the floor and talk about how many businesses in \nLouisiana have been destroyed, totally destroyed, and destroyed not \nbecause the people who run them have lost their lives, but either their \nfacilities are underwater, their equipment has been ravaged by the \nwinds and the storm, or perhaps their inventory has been completely \nwiped out. It has happened to 110,000 small businesses out of 300,000 \nbusinesses. So we are talking about a third of the businesses that were \nhere 3 weeks ago and are gone or are not able to operate anywhere near \ntheir 100 percent or 50 percent or even 25 percent capacity.\n  Now, I know this because I am getting calls from hundreds of small \nbusiness owners that go something like this: Senator Landrieu, we are \ntrying to answer the phones when they ring. When the communication \nsystems work, we are answering the phone. We want to come back and \nbuild up our business. But doesn't anybody in Washington understand, \nyou can't build a region until you build small business back?\n  It is the first thing we have to help build back. Why? Because these \nsmall businesses employ most of the people we are trying to help. \nWithout a paycheck, it does not do a lot of good to give people \nanything else because they need a paycheck to basically live and put \ncapital back into the community.\n  So I am making a special request of my colleagues, particularly the \nSenator from Maine, Ms. Snowe, who has been such a great advocate for \nsmall business, for Senator Kerry from Massachusetts, who has been a \nwonderful and very effective advocate for small business. I am pleading \nwith my colleagues on this amendment particularly. If we can accept \nthis version, great. If there is another version that could help, \nplease, let's do something today to send a signal to small businesses.\n  Gautreau's is a very well known and beautiful little restaurant that \nhas\n\n[[Page S10019]]\n\nbeen around for many years in New Orleans. It is a small cafe. Patrick \nSingley is the owner. He has had 20 employees. This is just one of \nhundreds of stories I could tell. His 20 employees keep calling him \nasking when they can come back to work. He has lost the roof of his \nrestaurant. His restaurant is completely flooded. His insurance company \nis covering his expenses for 2 weeks. The last I looked, those 2 weeks \nare gone. It may be months before he can reopen. He can't pay his \nworkers.\n  We could adopt this amendment today in the Senate and get it over to \nthe House. In a few days, they could take up this amendment.\n  This is not new legislation. Except for one provision that I \nunderstand is new, everything else exists. It has worked before, and it \ncould work again. We have to get these small businesses help: deferred \npayments on their SBA disaster loans; help them refinance their \nexisting disaster loans and their business debt; increase the disaster \nloan cap from $1.5 million to $10 million, as we did for 9/11 victims. \nI know that some businesses could borrow $250,000 to get back in \nbusiness and be in good shape, but some small businesses are going to \nneed to borrow a million dollars to get back in shape. Yet others are \ngoing to need to borrow $10 million. We know large companies are going \nto be borrowing hundreds of millions of dollars, maybe even billions, \ndepending on how large the companies are.\n  Small businesses that have trouble accessing capital because of their \nsmall size need the Federal Government to stand up for them and support \nthem. The supplemental 7(a) program is one with which we are familiar. \nWe have supported it. There are State bridge loans. This amendment, \nwhich is part of this package, would authorize $400 million to the \naffected State governments of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama to \nprovide emergency bridge loans or grants to small businesses in the \ndisaster area that have been adversely affected. In other words, a lot \nof these businesses have insurance policies, but those insurance \npolicies won't kick in for some time. Many of these small businesses \ndon't have a lot of cash, 6 months or a year, to continue their \noperations--this is a very important component of what we are trying to \ndo--whether they are a shoe store, a candy store, a restaurant, a \nmanufacturer, a telecom company, or a high-tech company in Louisiana \ntrying to operate. Small business counseling--we could all use a little \ncounseling--our small businesses can most certainly use it to help them \nget through this difficult time.\n  I know others have spoken about the amendment. I know there is a big \ndecision. Some say: We don't want to do it now. We want to do it not in \na piecemeal fashion. We have to wait until the whole package is \ntogether.\n  I am saying, as a Senator from Louisiana, we can't rebuild without \nour small businesses rebuilding first. We have to help people with \nfood, water, and shelter. We have to lift them out of the floodwaters. \nWe are still burying our dead respectfully. We are saving lives. But \nthe first cornerstone of rebuilding must be helping our small \nbusinesses get back on their feet. They employ most of the people. They \nhave been the hardest hit. They are the ones that have the least \nability to maneuver in a situation such as this.\n  I am pleading with the Senate, please take a hard look at this \namendment. Don't just say: We will do it in a month or two. Forty \npercent of businesses that go through a disaster never start up again. \nAccording to national statistics, 43 percent of small businesses never \nreopen. An additional 30 percent close down permanently within 2 years. \nIt is not fair to small businesses that have staked their anchor in \nLouisiana for generations. Fathers who have passed these businesses to \ntheir sons, mothers to their daughters, grandparents to their \ngrandchildren, need help now.\n  That is why I appreciate Senator Kerry and Senator Snowe for this \namendment. Senator Kerry has offered it, and many people are thinking \nabout whether to vote for it.\n  I just had a visit from one of our fine business owners who is \ncurrently serving, thank the Lord, as chairman of the board of \ndirectors of the U.S. National Chamber of Commerce, Maura Donahue from \nSt. Tammany Parish. She just left my office. She and her husband \noperate a small business. I said: Maura, God has put you in this \nspecial place for a reason, because you know personally, as the \nbusinesses that have suffered in Louisiana, what we need. Her \nleadership is going to be tremendous. I want to acknowledge her. \nThrough all the difficulties she has been, through her own business and \nher own family, she is there to help businesses in Louisiana. She can \nspeak from firsthand experience what this storm has done to her own \nbusiness and to the employees.\n  Let me define small business. I don't know exactly how many people \nher business employs, but I am talking about businesses that have less \nthan 20 employees. That is little, not tiny--1 or 2 could be small--but \n20. That is where the bulk of our employment is. If we allow them to \ncollapse because we can't get it together, we can't agree, or we have \nto wait for 2 months, most of these businesses will not be around by \nthe time the package gets through Washington bureaucracy. I am here to \nplead on behalf of small business, please give them a chance to stand \nup. Their electricity is getting back on. They need their roofs fixed, \ninventories restored, cell phone service turned on, BlackBerries need \nto work. Then they can start putting people back to work. If not, the \nbill that is going to come to this Congress for us to give unemployment \nto people, for us to pick up their medical, for us to pick up their \nlivelihoods is going to be even more.\n  Let's get our small businesses started first. That is why I support \nthis amendment. I don't know when we will vote on it. I offer my strong \nstatement of support for the small businesses in my State, for all \nbusinesses, but particularly for the small businesses that employ about \n85 percent of the people who are desperate for employment and desperate \nfor a place to show up to go to work.\n  I thank the Chair. I suggest the absence of quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\nAmendments Nos. 1654, 1694, as Modified, 1701, 1708, 1709, 1710, 1711, \n                             1712, en Bloc\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the managers' \namendments, which I now send to the desk, be considered and agreed to \nen bloc. These noncontroversial amendments have been cleared on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we, too, concur with the managers' \npackage. We think the amendments are very good. We look forward to \nmoving the bill. We are ready to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1654) was agreed to.\n  The amendments were agreed to en bloc, as follows:\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1694, as Modified\n\n  (Purpose: To waive the match requirement under the Bulletproof Vest \n  Partnership grant program for purposes of replacing defective vests)\n\n       On page 142, after line 3, insert the following:\n       Sec.   .

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has agreed by \nunanimous consent to include in the Commerce-Justice-Science \nappropriations Act, H.R. 2862, an amendment proposed by myself, Senator \nShelby and Senator Specter to waive the match required under the \nBulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998 for law enforcement \nagencies that received funds under that act, used them to purchase \nZylon-based body armor, which has recently been shown by the Department \nof Justice to be defective, and now want to replace those faulty vests \nwith funds awarded by that act. This waiver would be granted only if \nthose agencies can present documentation to prove that they purchased \nZylon-based body armor with funds awarded to them under the Bulletproof \nVest Partnership Grant Act. I thank my friends Senator Shelby, the \nchairman of the CJS Appropriations Subcommittee, and Senator Specter, \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for cosponsoring this \namendment and for their leadership on this issue.\n  I was proud to partner with our former colleague Senator Campbell to \nauthor and shepherd into law the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act \nof 1998, which was reauthorized by the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Act \nof 2000 and most recently as part of the State Justice Institute \nReauthorization Act of 2004, to create the Bulletproof Vest Partnership \ngrant program as a means of helping law enforcement agencies purchase \nbody armor for their rank-and-file officers. We wrote that act, in \npart, in response to a situation that became apparent in the tragic \nCarl Drega shootout in 1997 on the Vermont-New Hampshire border, in \nwhich two State troopers who did not have bulletproof vests were \nkilled. The Federal officers who responded to the scenes of the \nshooting spree were equipped with life-saving body armor, but the State \nand local law enforcement officers lacked protective vests because of \nthe cost.\n  Bulletproof vests remain one of the foremost defenses for our \nuniformed officers. Since their introduction more than 30 years ago, \nbody armor has saved more than 2,700 lives. From 1999 through 2005, \nover 11,500 jurisdictions have participated in the Bulletproof Vest \nPartnership Program, with $118 million in Federal funds committed to \nsupport the purchase of an estimated 450,000 vests. The Bulletproof \nVest Partnership Program funds up to 50 percent of the cost of each \nvest purchased or replaced by law enforcement agency applicants. Under \nlaw, the program is required to fully fund the 50 percent of requested \nvest needs for jurisdictions under 100,000 in population. Remaining \nfunds are distributed to jurisdictions of over 100,000 in population.\n  Concerns from the law enforcement community over the effectiveness of \nbody armor surfaced nearly 2 years ago when a Pennsylvania police \nofficer was shot and critically wounded through his relatively new \nZylon-based body armor vest. Responding to requests\n\n[[Page S10021]]\n\nthat Senator Campbell and I made, as well as from law enforcement \nofficials, Attorney General Ashcroft launched the Body Armor Safety \nInitiative. The National Institute of Justice, NIJ, was directed to \ninitiate an examination of Zylon-based bullet-resistant armor--both new \nand used--to analyze upgrade kits provided by manufacturers to retrofit \nZylon-based bullet-resistant armors, and to review the existing program \nby which bullet-resistant armor is tested to determine if the process \nneeds modification.\n  On August 24, 2005, the Justice Department announced that test \nresults indicate that used Zylon containing body armor vests may not \nprovide the intended level of ballistic resistance. Unfortunately, an \nestimated 200,000 Zylon-based vests have been purchased, many with \nBulletproof Vest Partnership Program funds, and now need to be \nreplaced. The Justice Department has adopted new interim requirements \nfor its body armor compliance testing program. It has also added an \nadditional $10 million to the $23.6 million already available for the \ncurrent fiscal year to law enforcement through the Bulletproof Vest \nPartnership program to assist agencies in their replacement of Zylon-\nbased body armor vests.\n  Before concerns on Zylon-based vest safety arose, DOJ and NIJ had set \nvoluntary compliance testing protocols to assess whether models of \nballistic-resistant body armor comply with a certain minimum standard \nof protection and resistance. All models of ballistic-resistant body \narmor that complied with those standards were eligible for funding \nunder the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act. As it turns out, \nthose standards were not rigorous enough and the certification process \nwas not onerous enough, thereby subjecting our Nation's law enforcement \nofficers to severe safety risks.\n  Across our Nation, law enforcement agencies are struggling over how \nto find the funds necessary to replace defective vests that are less \nthan 5 years old with ones that will actually stop bullets and save \nlives. Vests cost between $500 and $1,000 each, depending on the style. \nThe extra $10 million released by the Justice Department is only a drop \nin the bucket and these officers are being forced to dip into their own \npockets to pay for new vests unless the Federal Government offers more \nhelp. The amendment by Senator Shelby, Senator Specter and me that has \nbeen included in the CJS Appropriations Act will help ease the burden \nfaced by officers and their families and further our mission to provide \nevery police officer who needs a safe vest with the means to purchase \none.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I know for those who are watching on C-\nSPAN, they wonder what are we doing as we go through names such as \nAkaka and Baucus in a quorum call. Actually, what we have been doing is \nworking very quietly with other Senators to see, where they have \noffered amendments, if we could negotiate compromises and just take \nthem. We have been working very collegially with my wonderful colleague \nfrom Alabama, Senator Shelby.\n  As you can see, we just cleared eight amendments on which we could \ncome to bipartisan support. So there is a lot of work going on right in \nback of these doors and also with other Senators in their offices.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1648\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, pretty soon we are going to be debating \nthe Coburn amendment. We could not reach an agreement on it, even \nthough there was a good-faith effort.\n  This Coburn amendment could bring great damage to the efforts for \ninnovation and discovery in this country. What the Senator from \nOklahoma wishes to do is eliminate a program called the Advanced \nTechnology Program that is currently at the National Institute of \nStandards.\n  This is a Government agency under the Department of Commerce, and its \njob is, No. 1, to establish standards of products that are coming to \nthe marketplace so that they would be uniform--for example, that every \nfirehose would have the same gauge so the guys coming down from New \nYork, working with the people from Alabama, could bring their equipment \nand it could be joined together. That is what a standard is.\n  Madame Curie discovered radium, and it was there they established the \nCurie standard on how to measure radioactivity. But it does more than \nthat. The Advanced Technology Program actually promotes innovation and \ntechnology transfer.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma would eliminate the \nfunding, and commitments that have already been made to those people \nprimarily in the private sector would be eliminated. It would hurt \ncritical research and development. This is very important to our \ncompetitiveness. We keep talking about offshoring. We don't want to \noffshore jobs. What we need to do is come up with the new ideas, come \nup with the new products that create the new jobs right here in the \nUnited States of America.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma is well intentioned. He \nwants to eliminate a Government program and provide it to local law \nenforcement and to weather. We understand what his priorities are. In \nthe bill, working on a bipartisan basis, we feel we have done that.\n  I know, in the reading of the bill, one can see we provide over $1 \nbillion to State and local law enforcement. We provide half-a-million \ndollars to the COPS program that helps local law enforcement be able to \nadd more COPS on the beat. We add more money, $775 million, to the \nWeather Service operation, which has proved so wonderful and effective \nin predicting hurricanes and, actually, tornados and other things.\n  I support the goal of the Coburn amendment to increase funding for \nthese critical programs, but we cannot support the cutting of the \nAdvanced Technology Program.\n  On March 17 of 2005, 53 Senators voted to support the ATP program in \nan amendment to the budget resolution. So I am going to urge my \ncolleagues to defeat the Coburn amendment.\n  I have come not to defend another Government program. I am not here \nto defend another agency. I am here to protect the interests of the \nUnited States of America in innovation, discovery, and partnerships \nwith the private sector that actually come up with those new ideas. \nMany of those ideas save lives, and they create the jobs that save \nlivelihoods.\n  My colleague from Oklahoma had some great charts, and it implied that \nATP was corporate welfare. This is not corporate welfare. This is a \ncreative approach that offers partnerships between the Federal \nGovernment and the brain power of the private sector. Through these \npartnerships, ATP accelerates the development of innovative \ntechnologies that promise significant commercial payoffs and widespread \nbenefits for the Nation, but they are so early in the development it is \nvery difficult for them to attract private investment, even venture \ncapital.\n  How does this agency work? ATP funds development in technology that \nis too new or too risky for private sector investment in the so-called \n``valley of death'' between research and commercialization. There is \nlots of money around for research and there is money around for \ncommercialization but not for that bridge between those. ATP fills this \ngap. It does not displace private capital because these projects cannot \nget private capital. ATP applicants are required to look first for \nprivate capital, venture, wherever they can find it. ATP is the funder \nof last resort.\n  For example, in the 1990s, NIH was conducting research on the human \ngenome and DNA. It was a breakthrough effort, and at the same time NIH \nworked simultaneously with ATP and industry. Why? We needed practical \ntools to use the discoveries that benefit the Nation so we just would \nnot have this research in the lab. Guess what came out of it. ATP's \ninvestment came out with new ideas for DNA technology to detect \ndisease, to get lifesaving drugs to the market, to catch criminals.\n  State crime labs are using that technology. They are using DNA to go \nback to old death penalty cases to make\n\n[[Page S10022]]\n\nsure that we have the right person who committed a particular crime. \nDNA is saving lives, and it is also restoring justice in this country. \nIt is a phenomenal breakthrough. We helped take it from the lab, worked \nwith the private sector, and came up with these new ideas.\n  Is ATP important and effective? Sure. It has benefited the Nation for \ntwo reasons. One, we partnered the Government with industry and the \nprivate sector to develop those new technologies. For example, ATP was \na partner in the development of something I am tremendously interested \nin, and I know the Presiding Officer is. It helped come up with a new \ngeneration of digital mammography and radiology. It provided far more \naccurate detection at far lower cost, and it is projected to save over \n$200 million in health care costs. Helping develop that one idea is \nsaving lives, helping families and, at the same time, what it saves in \nthe burgeoning health care costs would pay for ATP itself.\n  ATP has contributed to the development of more than 240 new \ntechnologies that have been commercialized. It improves our economy. \nJust 41 of their 700 projects to date have given us economic benefit.\n  The other thing that my colleague from Oklahoma suggests is, again, \nwe are funding big corporations. Why are we doing that? I will not give \ntheir names but this blue chip and this S 500 and so on. Well, what \ncolleagues need to know is that 75 percent of all ATP recipients are \nsmall businesses.\n  Are large companies involved in ATP? Yes. How? Because they have \njoint ventures offered with smaller companies in their chain of \ndevelopment. In these arrangements, almost all ATP funding goes to the \nsmaller company, but the larger companies handle all administrative \ncosts so that the small companies can focus more on product \ndevelopment. By the way, large companies do not get a free ride. Large \ncompanies must match the ATP by 60 percent. So this is a partnership to \nleverage these private sector efforts.\n  For example, large automakers partnered with the auto parts supply \npeople to improve the manufacturing of American automobiles. It has \nimproved our aerospace industry, making manufacturing more competitive.\n  Finally, ATP does not subsidize companies to do product development. \nCompanies have to have their own scientific plan. They have to have a \nbusiness plan on how the technology will go to market. Our ATP only \nfunds the development of the new technologies. Companies must then take \nit to the marketplace.\n  We understand that our new colleague wants to use the Federal \ntaxpayer dollar wisely, and he wants to protect communities by using \nthe money to go to law enforcement and weather. We want to help that, \ntoo, and we have put the money in the budget for that. What we want to \ndo, when we are talking about protecting the American people, is \nprotect them through innovation, discovery, and the new ideas for the \nnew products that lead to the new jobs that keep this country ahead and \nan economic superpower.\n  I hope that when our colleague comes and discusses this and we have a \nvote, my colleagues--certainly those on my side of the aisle--will take \nmy word for it that we have supported law enforcement, we have \nsupported the Weather Service, and this Advanced Technology Program is \ncrucial to the future of our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN, Mr. President, the Advanced Technology Program, ATP, \npromotes the development of new, innovative products that are made and \ndeveloped in the United States, helping American companies compete \nagainst their foreign competitors and contribute to the growth of the \nU.S. economy.\n  We have lost nearly 2.8 million manufacturing jobs since January \n2001. In the face of these losses and strong global economic \ncompetition, we should be doing all we can to promote programs that \nhelp create jobs and strengthen the technological innovation of \nAmerican companies.\n  The ATP is a very modest program which, according to the Department \nof Commerce, has had a result eight times more in technologies \ndeveloped than the amount of money we have put into the program. This \nis an eight-time return on investment in advanced technologies which is \nachieved when the Department of Commerce partners with industry through \nthe ATP.\n  During consideration of the Senate budget resolution in March, the \nSenate adopted a Levin-DeWine amendment to restore funding for the \nAdvanced Technology Program, putting the Senate on record in support of \nthis program. Leaders on the Commerce, Justice, and Science \nSubcommittee also support this important innovative program and have \nfunded it at $140 million in their bill for fiscal year 2006. I urge my \ncolleagues to continue their support for the ATP and oppose this \namendment that would gut the ATP.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, America's future, indeed the world's \nfuture, will be more powerfully influenced by science and technology \nthan ever before. Where once nations measured their strength by the \nsize of their armies and arsenals, in the world of the future, \nknowledge and innovation will matter most.\n  The Advanced Technology Program, ATP, at the National Institutes of \nStandards is a modest Government program, $140 million for fiscal year \n2006, that helps spur the development of technologies that create the \nindustries and the high-wage jobs of the future.\n  What sets this program apart from our other publicly supported R \nprograms is that it focuses on the technology needs of American \nindustry, not those of the Federal Government. Its pre-competitive \nresearch nonetheless addresses many of America's most pressing \nwidespread challenges including improving homeland security, \nstrengthening our manufacturing processes, and lowering our dependence \non foreign sources of energy.\n  Awards are made strictly on the basis of rigorous peer-reviewed \ncompetitions. Additionally, it has very strict cost-sharing rules, and \nit does not fund product development.\n  The Advanced Technology Program fills a unique role in U.S. \ninnovation policy. ATP bridges the gap, the so-called ``valley of \ndeath'' between innovative ideas arising from basic research in the \nlaboratory, and the access to market capital to commercialize them.\n  Federal funding for R is currently in decline, hovering at about \nhalf of its mid-1960s peak of 2 percent of GDP. Excluding spending on \ndefense, homeland security, and space, Federal investment in \nfundamental research is expected to decline in real terms over the next \n5 years.\n  Although industry funds nearly 65 percent of U.S. research and \ndevelopment, growth in industrial R is slowing. Moreover, industry \nconcentrates most of its R on near-term product and process \nimprovements. Truly radical innovation is often left to new firms, \nwhich often have difficulty attracting capital. Venture capital firms \nsteer away from high-risk technology development because profits are \ntoo uncertain or too distant. In fact, less that 1.5 percent of venture \ncapital funding is available for proof-of-concept, or seed funding, and \nearly product development.\n  However, through partnerships with the private sector, ATP's early \nstage investment accelerates the development of innovative, high-risk, \nhigh-pay-off, longer-term efforts to develop technologies that promise \nsignificant commercial profits and widespread benefits for the Nation.\n  The administration's own analysis documents that the ATP program has \ngenerated $17 billion in economic benefits from just 41 of the 736 \nprojects it has completed, a truly staggering rate of return on \ntaxpayers' investments. In a comprehensive review of ATP in 1991, the \nNational Academy of Sciences' National Research Council found that it \nwas a highly rated public-private partnership program that spurred the \ndevelopment of new technologies and concluded that ``the ATP it could \nuse more funding effectively and efficiently.''\n  It is no wonder that nations from around the world are intensely \ninterested in learning more about how our ATP process works in order to \nfine tune their own national efforts in innovation. In an effort to \nboost their economic growth, Taiwan, Australia, France, Germany, Japan, \nthe Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom are all developing \nprograms based on major features similar to our Advanced Technology \nProgram.\n\n[[Page S10023]]\n\n  So why, a reasonable person might ask, are we trying to kill what \nother nations are trying to copy?\n  That is one of the key questions the Senate must address when \nconsidering the proposed amendments to the Commerce-Justice-Science \nappropriations measure that would cripple the Advanced Technology \nProgram.\n  Other countries are coming up fast behind us on the technology track \nand are pouring resources into their scientific and technological \ninfrastructure. If current trends continue, there is a very good chance \nthat U.S. competitiveness in key high-tech areas may fall behind.\n  When we talk about competitiveness, what we mean is our capacity to \nincrease the real income of all Americans by producing high-value \nproducts and services that meet the test of world markets. The fact \nthat we need to be competitive in the global market is not some mere \nabstraction, nor is it some future worry that we have time to ignore \ntoday.\n\n  High-tech R today is so enmeshed in our economy that it is part and \nparcel of the jobs and growth issue. The relationship between \ninnovation and economic growth has only increased in recent years as \nthe world shifts to an increasingly knowledge-based economy. The way we \nshould think about it is that knowledge drives innovation, innovation \ndrives productivity, and productivity drives our economic growth.\n  ATP has helped drive economic growth in my State of New Mexico by \npartnering with companies of all sizes and non-profits encouraging them \nto take on greater technical challenges.\n  An ATP project funded in 1991 teamed six top printed wiring board \nsuppliers and users and Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque to \naddress technical deficiencies that had developed due to cutbacks in \ncorporate research budgets. The U.S. industry which had been losing \nmarket share at the time, dropping from 42 percent to 26 percent, was \nable to turn around this decline because of research co-funded by ATP. \nOver 200,000 jobs were rescued.\n  ATP projects in New Mexico have also included joint efforts with \nCabot Superior MicroPowders in Albuquerque to reduce the amount of \nprecious metals used in the manufacturing process to reducing the costs \nof fuel cells. Star Cryoelectronics in Santa Fe linked up with ATP on \ntechnology to enable rapid identification of particulate contaminants \nand defects during semiconductor fabrication. ATP along with MesoFuel \nin Albuquerque is developing a technology to generate pure hydrogen \nreliably and safely.\n  The need for the Advanced Technology Program has never been more \napparent. We have absolutely no choice but to emphasize what we do best \nin this fierce global competition.\n  Our most important strength has always been innovation. Our can-do \nspirit of commercializing technological innovation has always been \nAmerica's core competence. And today that ability is further honed by \nthe Advanced Technology Program that enables us to innovate better and \nfaster than anyone else.\n  Rather than cutting back on our investments in the future, we must \ncontinue to invest in proven programs like ATP to develop the \ntechnologies to create the new industries that will provide solid \neconomic growth in the years to come.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I call for the regular order with respect to the Coburn \namendment No. 1648.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment. This amendment \nwould terminate funding for the Advanced Technology Program, what we \ncall ATP. ATP is unique among Federal research programs. Most Federal \nresearch is focused on advancing scientific knowledge. However, there \nis a very long road from scientific discovery in a university lab to \nthe commercialization of that product.\n  According to the National Science Foundation, less than 1.5 percent \nof venture capital funding in the private sector is available as seed \nfunding for proof-of-concept. ATP seeks to fill that gap in funding.\n  The program was founded to ensure that not only do we win the Nobel \nPrizes with our excellent venture research but that we also \ncommercialize our discoveries ahead of our foreign partners and thereby \ncreate jobs for our own people.\n  Some have said the idea that we are in a global technology race is \noutdated. Nothing could be further from the truth. Whether it is \nsemiconductors in China and Taiwan or nanotechnology in Europe, our \nglobal competitors are investing heavily in programs to beat us to the \nmarketplace. Surely we can afford the $140 million investment included \nin this bill to stay competitive.\n  The Advanced Technology Program projects have succeeded in a wide \nrange of fields. They are already delivering cheaper, better bone \nmarrow transplants, mammograms, and cartilage repair. They are enabling \ncompanies to make biodegradable plastic from corn, improving \nmanufacturing, and powering longer lasting lightweight fuel cells.\n  Moreover, this program has helped small businesses. More than 75 \npercent of all ATP projects include a small business. Sixty-six percent \nof ATP projects are led by or involve only a small business. Of the \nsingle-applicant awards, 78 percent have gone to small businesses and \n11 percent have gone to medium-sized businesses and nonprofits. By \ncontrast, only 11 percent of solo awards have gone to large businesses.\n  In a more extensive and comprehensive review, the National Academy of \nSciences found ATP to be an effective Federal partnership that they \nsaid ``could use more funding effectively and efficiently.''\n  Measurement and evaluation have been part of the ATP program since \nits inception. The most recent ATP annual report showed the program has \ngenerated $17 billion in economic benefits from 41 of its 736 completed \nprojects.\n  In short, this program works. After all, the Council on \nCompetitiveness's National Innovation Initiative report noted that \n``innovation will be the single most important factor in determining \nAmerica's success through the 21st Century.''\n  If we adopt the amendment offered by my friend from Oklahoma, Senator \nCoburn, we would cut off a program which has as its sole purpose \ninvesting in American innovation.\n  This program has the support of the Senate. On March 17 of this year, \nthe Senate voted 53 to 46 in favor of a sense-of-the-Senate amendment \nto the budget resolution stating:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the Senate Committee on \n     Appropriations should make every effort to provide funding \n     for the Advanced Technology Program in fiscal year 2006.\n\n  That is exactly what we are doing. This bill funds technology \ninitiatives which fuel our economy. The program works. In this austere \nbudget environment, there is no room for programs that do not work. We \ndo not have that luxury.\n  I oppose the termination of the Advanced Technology Program. I move \nto table the Coburn amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Alaska (Mrs. Murkowski) and the Senator from Louisiana \n(Mr. Vitter).\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know my colleague from Arkansas is \nintending to seek recognition in a moment. I wanted to ask the manager \nand ranking member of the subcommittee, I offered the amendment that \ndeals with trade and weakening of trade remedies. I offered that \npreviously, and I am wondering where that might exist with respect to \nthe vote we might have this evening. I know the manager wants to finish \nthe bill. I want to be helpful in doing that, but I think my amendment \nis germane. It has been offered. I have debated it. I wonder what we \nmight expect with respect to a vote.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, it is my understanding that Senator \nGrassley has been in some negotiations regarding the amendment. Trade \nis under the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee. I don't know where \nhe is now. I do not know if he voted, but we have been working with \nhim.\n  I know the Senator wants to bring up his amendment as soon as he can. \nBut I want to make sure Senator Grassley is ready and on the floor. We \nwill try to locate him.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alabama. I \nbelieve the amendment is germane. I have debated it, and I hope we can \nfind a way to have a vote on that amendment. It is a very important \namendment with great merit. My expectation is we ought to proceed.\n  I thank the Senator, and I will look forward to having the \nopportunity to have this vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1703\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. I call for the regular order of business with respect to \nPryor amendment No. 1703.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1703, as Modified\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. I have a modification which I have sent to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1703), as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 190, between lines 14 and 155, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 522. Of the funds appropriated to the Federal Trade \n     Commission by this Act, not less than $1,000,000 shall be \n     used by the Commission to conduct an immediate investigation \n     into nationwide gasoline prices in the aftermath of Hurricane \n     Katrina; Provided, That the investigation shall include (1) \n     any evidence of price-gouging by companies with total United \n     States wholesale sales of gasoline and petroleum distillates \n     for calendar 2004 in excess of $500,000,000 and by any retail \n     distributor of gasoline and petroleum distillates against \n     which multiple formal complaints (that identify the location \n     of a particular retail distributor and provide contact \n     information for the complainant) of price-gouging were filed \n     in August or September, 2005, with a Federal or State \n     consumer protection agency, (2) a comparison of, and an \n     explanation of the reasons for changes in, profit levels of \n     such companies during the 12-month period ending on August \n     31, 2005, and their profit levels for the month of September, \n     2005, including information for particular companies on a \n     basis that does not permit the identification of any company \n     to which the information relates, (3) a summary of tax \n     expenditures (as defined in section 3(3) of the Congressional \n     Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 622(3)) \n     for such companies, (4) the effects of increased gasoline \n     prices and gasoline price-gouging on economic activity in the \n     United States, and (5) the overall cost of increased gasoline \n     prices and gasoline price-gouging to the economy, including \n     the impact on consumers' purchasing power in both declared \n     State and National disaster areas and elsewhere; Provided \n     further, That, in conducting its investigation, the \n     Commission shall treat as evidence of price-gouging any \n     finding that the average price of gasoline available for sale \n     to the public in September, 2005, or thereafter in a market \n     area located in an area designated as a State or National \n     disaster area because of Hurricane Katrina, or in any other \n     area where price-gouging complaints have been filed because \n     of Hurricane Katrina with a Federal or State consumer \n     protection agency, exceeded the average price of such \n     gasoline in that area for the month of August, 2005, unless \n     the Commission finds substantial evidence that the increase \n     is substantially attributable to additional costs in \n     connection with the production, transportation, delivery, and \n     sale of gasoline in that area or to national or international \n     market trends; Provided further, That in any areas or markets \n     in which the Commission determines price increases are due to \n     factors other than the additional costs it shall also notify \n     the appropriate state agency of its findings. Provided \n     further, That the Commission shall provide information on the \n     progress of the investigation to the Senate and House \n     Appropriations Committees, the Senate Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation, and the House of Representatives \n     Committee on Energy and Commerce every 30 days after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, shall provide those Committees a \n     written interim report 90 days after such date, and shall \n     transmit a final report to those Committees, together with \n     its findings and recommendations, no later than 180 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act; Provided further, \n     That the Commission shall transmit recommendations, based on \n     its findings, to the Congress for any legislation necessary \n     to protect consumers from gasoline price-gouging in both \n     State and National disaster areas and elsewhere; Provided \n     further, That chapter 35 of title 44, United States Code, \n     does not apply to the collection of information for the \n     investigation required by this section; Provided further, \n     That if, during the investigation, the Commission obtains \n     evidence that a person may have violated a criminal law, the \n     Commission may transmit that evidence to appropriate Federal \n     or State authorities; and Provided further, That nothing in \n     this section affects any other authority of the Commission to \n     disclose information.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, this is an amendment relating to price \ngouging on gasoline. I thank many of my colleagues who have cosponsored \nand helped in this process: Senators Mikulski, Salazar, Obama, \nStabenow, Ben Nelson, Bill Nelson, Corzine, Bingaman, Dorgan, Durbin, \nInouye, Feingold, Dodd, Kerry, and there may be one or two others who \nhave wanted their names added in the last few moments. I thank my \ncosponsors for all the work they have done.\n  This started with me traveling the State of Arkansas, as many Members \nhave traveled their home States, during the August recess, and \neverywhere I went people talked about high gas prices. This is putting \na strain on the economy, putting a strain on families, hurting not only \nevery section of the country but also every sector of the economy.\n  It is very difficult for the people in my State, and I am sure it is \nhard for people in other States, to pay record high prices at the gas \npump, only to open the business pages and see the oil companies are \nmaking record profits.\n  A bad situation has become worse in the aftermath of Hurricane \nKatrina. Americans have a right to know why gas prices are so high. \nThey have a right to know if there is price gouging occurring. This \namendment does not say there is. This amendment requires the FTC to do \nan immediate investigation into high gas prices to make comparisons and \ndeterminations and make sure there is no price gouging occurring.\n  I don't want to say he agrees completely with this amendment, but \ncertainly President Bush has said on ABC, on ``Good Morning America'':\n\n       I think it ought to be zero tolerance of people breaking \n     the law during an emergency such as this, whether it be \n     looting or price gouging at the gasoline pump or taking \n     advantage of charitable giving or insurance fraud.\n\n  That is from President Bush. Certainly, the sentiment is there that \nif there is gouging going on, we need to know about it. This requires \nthe FTC to do an immediate investigation and come back and report to \nCongress with their findings within 30 days.\n  I give a special thank you to Senator Domenici. We worked very \nclosely with him and his staff, we worked very closely with Senator \nShelby and his staff, and Senators Bingaman, Cantwell, Bill Nelson, and \nBen Nelson. Everyone played a role. I give a very special thank you to \nour friend and colleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski. She has done \nyeoman's work on this amendment. She and her staff--I need to give \ncredit to all the staff. We reached a bipartisan agreement on this\n\n[[Page S10025]]\n\na few moments ago. I thank all my colleagues and certainly I look \nforward to hearing from Senator Mikulski on this very important issue \non which she has worked so hard.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand the distinguished Senator \nhas commented about this amendment and about my participation. I thank \nhim for his comments and state it was a pleasure to work on it. I think \nit will accomplish something. The people want some hope that it is \nbeing looked at objectively. I am glad to be part of it.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President. I rise today to speak about a very \nimportant amendment authored by Senator Pryor, which I have \ncosponsored. Our amendment allocates a minimum of $1 million of the \nfunds in this appropriations bill to allow the Federal Trade Commission \nto complete the investigation into possible gasoline price gouging. I \nwas one of the authors of the original provision included in the energy \nbill that directs the FTC to investigate gasoline pricing practices. So \nI am very pleased to be joining Senator Pryor in ensuring that we get \nsome answers quickly.\n  I offered my original amendment to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 in \nJune of this year when we were debating the energy bill on the floor of \nthe Senate. Back in June we were already experiencing high gasoline \nprices that fluctuated wildly from day to day, and in some cases, from \nhour to hour. I heard from many Michigan families who are unable to \nbudget for gasoline to take their kids to school and commute to and \nfrom work because the prices they paid each week varied so much. I also \nheard from people in Michigan that they are extremely worried about \ngasoline pricing practices. They are concerned that they are getting \ngouged at the pump with no recourse.\n  A lot has changed since June and I am sorry to say that it hasn't \nbeen for the better.\n  Since June we have had a catastrophic hurricane ravage Alabama, \nMississippi, and Louisiana. We have poured our hearts and our donations \ninto those States to help the people who lost their homes and \nlivelihoods get back on their feet. And we will continue to work as \nhard as possible to rebuild the towns and cities that have been \ndestroyed.\n  But the impacts of Katrina spread beyond the Gulf Coast States. \nWhether or not we got a single breath of wind from the storm, we are \nfeeling the continued impacts of Katrina's impact in all our States in \nthe form of high gas prices.\n  In Michigan we saw prices as high as $3.21 per gallon earlier this \nmonth. Prices have eased a little bit in the weeks since Katrina hit \nthe Gulf Coast States, but consumers are still very wary. There was a \nquote from a Michigan resident published recently in the Detroit News \nthat speaks volumes about consumer confidence in gasoline pricing. Mr. \nTony Mapson of Detroit, upon seeing gasoline priced at $2.69 per \ngallon, said, ``Maybe it is a con. They raise the price so high and \nthen lower it so we don't complain so much.''\n  I think Mr. Mapson speaks for many Americans who distrust the price \nthey are given at the pump. This is the reason I included a provision \nin the energy bill, which was signed into law on August 8, instructing \nthe FTC to investigate gasoline price gouging. There has been some \ndisagreement about when the FTC needs to finish their investigation \nunder the law. It was my intention that the investigation should be \nstarted immediately and the FTC should complete it and report the \nfindings back to Congress within 90 days of enactment. The FTC \ninterprets the law to mean that they have 90 days to begin their \ninvestigation. As of today, it is has been 37 days since my price \ngouging provision became law. I strongly urge the FTC to immediately \nbegin their investigation as directed by the Energy Policy Act and \ninclude the provisions in the amendment we are offering to the \nCommerce-Justice-Science appropriations bill. We must have the results \nof the investigation as quickly as possible so that we can take any \nnecessary actions.\n  I strongly urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1710\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator Cantwell \nfor her tireless leadership in the fight against meth. Meth abuse has \nreached epidemic levels across our country, and by working to ensure \nthat we don't shift the burden onto local communities, Senator Cantwell \nhas given State and local law enforcement an important ally.\n  Accepting her amendment to add $20 million to the hotspots program \nbrings funding for meth State and local law enforcement to $80 million. \nCoupled with the bipartisan addition of $43 million of meth \nauthorization dollars that Senator Cantwell cosponsored and other meth-\nrelated funding, this bill makes an enormous Federal commitment to help \nour State and local effort to fight the meth battle.\n  Senator Cantwell's amendment sends vital Federal support to law \nenforcement officers and first responders on the front lines of the \nmeth epidemic everywhere. These crime fighters need more funds to help \ncombat this dangerous drug, and Senator Cantwell has fought to give \nthem resources they need. I appreciate her work to improve this bill, \nas do countless law enforcement officers across America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise as the ranking member of this \nsubcommittee, and also as a cosponsor of the Pryor amendment.\n  First of all, I thank the Senator from Arkansas for offering this \namendment which would give $1 million to the Federal Trade Commission \nto investigate whether there is some type of price gouging, price \nfixing, going on in the marketplace.\n  I thank the Senator for his leadership and the fact that he wants to \nproceed on the basis of fact and not just rhetoric and finger-pointing.\n  We thank the Senator from New Mexico, the chairman of the Energy \nbill. This has received bipartisan support, exactly what we need. Boy, \ndo we need it.\n  We in Maryland are hot. We are absolutely hot about these gas prices. \nMaryland has the third highest gas prices in the United States of \nAmerica. Who are we behind? Are we behind California with complicated \nenvironmental rules? No, we are behind the District of Columbia, and we \nare behind New York. No one can say why. Our Governor convened a \nspecial meeting of oil executives to tell him why, and he is \ndissatisfied. Our general assembly is working on it to see if there is \nsomething we can do at the State level.\n  There is clamor for getting rid of the Federal or State taxes. People \nwant the prices to come down.\n  We want to know, is there gouging? Is there fixing? We want to \noperate on the basis of fact.\n  In my home State of Maryland, my cost of commuting has gone up $30 a \nweek. I can afford it, but many Marylanders cannot. I saw on a local TV \nstation a mother who filled up her minivan, a soccer mom. It was $90. \nShe put her head on the windshield and cried; how could her family \nafford it?\n  We see the variance in prices, block by block; in one neighborhood \ngas is selling for $3.49 and less than 5 miles away, in Baltimore City, \nit is selling cheaper. Go to another pump further out in a valley \nsituation and it is selling for $3.63. Guess what. Over in another \nneighborhood, it is selling for $3.03--a 60-cent-per-gallon difference. \nCan anyone tell me what it is about the marketplace that it is 60 cents \ndifference? Who is pulling the strings?\n  The consequences are severe. If you have a family and are a commuter, \nyou wonder how you can continue to be a soccer mom and a dad and go to \nwork every day.\n  Business in my community is affected, big and small; small \nbusinesses, from the florist who delivers the flowers, to the \npharmacist who is willing to deliver prescription drugs, to the \nelectrician, to the plumber using a pickup.\n  Much of our food supply comes by truck to our supermarkets. They will \nhave to charge more. It means food is going to go up. People love \nMaryland and love our crabs, but our watermen are aghast to take the \nboat out. It is costing a fortune. Marylanders want to know the facts.\n  I am pleased to join with the Senator from Arkansas. This has been a \nbipartisan agreement. This will move it forward. Let's fund this at the \nFTC. Let's get the investigation underway and get ahold of the gas \nprices affecting so many Americans.\n\n[[Page S10026]]\n\n  I thank the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Shelby, for his \npatience while we worked so assiduously on the bipartisan agreement.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Pryor-Mikulski amendment be agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I take a minute and commend the Senator \nfrom Arkansas, Senator Pryor, for his leadership and for reaching out \nto the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator \nDomenici, and Senator Mikulski and Senator Talent, and so many others. \nThis is a bipartisan approach. Senator Pryor is the leader.\n  Nobody likes gouging. Gasoline is too high. We want the markets to \nwork. If market forces work, there won't be gouging. It will be an \norderly movement of supply and demand--if the demand is too high, the \nprices will go up, but not like that, not like I have seen it at the \npump, as we have seen coast to coast.\n  The American people fear there is gouging going on. Senator Pryor \nshould be commended for pursuing this issue. We hope the Federal Trade \nCommission will do its work. I support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1703), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 1652, Withdrawn\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I will talk about another amendment from the senior \nSenator from Arkansas. I ask that Lincoln amendment No. 1652 be \nwithdrawn because that policy content will be accomplished on another \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 1669, Withdrawn\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent my amendment, No. \n1669, be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. I thank the ranking member and the chairman of the \nsubcommittee. We tried to work out an accommodation on the amendment. \nThey made a good-faith effort, and we were unable to do so.\n  I also want to let the chairman and the ranking member know that the \namendment I had filed dealing with eminent domain will not be offered. \nThis is a very important issue. I do not believe government should be \nable to take private land for the purposes of private economic \ndevelopment. People are well aware of the case this deals with. It is \nof grave concern to a lot of Members. The chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee indicated they will have hearings on this matter next week. I \nlook forward to a full discussion of the case and the issues associated \nwith the taking of private land. I want the chairman and the ranking \nmember to know I will not offer that amendment that has been filed.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator for his withdrawing of the \namendment yet maintaining his stand. I, too, am sympathetic to the \npolicy direction the Senator is interested in under eminent domain.\n  The Senator might not know my history, but I got into politics \nfighting a highway. Had the recent Supreme Court decision stood, we \nwould not have had a fighting chance. Just to tell the consequences of \nthat, the highway would have gone where our Inner Harbor is; it would \nhave gone through Camden Yards, the Ravens Stadium, and where we are \ntrying to create the digital harbor. We got our economic development \nbut not the way the planners wanted.\n  I am sympathetic. It has raised some liberal eyebrows, but I look \nforward to working with you, and maybe we will have a Sununu-Mikulski \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1709\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the Senate on \nhaving just agreed to the Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act in the form \nof an amendment, the Talent-Dodd amendment. I will speak a few minutes \nabout it. My friend from Connecticut also will make a few comments \nabout this amendment.\n  The Senate's action will be viewed, if we can get it agreed to by the \nHouse, as a historic moment, a blow in favor of civil rights and \nfinding out the truth in cases that have been covered up for years, in \na sense, but are still there.\n  Let me briefly address the merits of the amendment that the Senator \nfrom Connecticut and I have cosponsored before the Senate. The bill \ncreates an unsolved civil rights crime section of the Civil Rights \nDivision, a cold case section of the Civil Rights Division, the sole \npurpose of which would be to investigate unsolved murders that were a \nviolation of the civil rights laws at the time they occurred and have \nnever been solved. Many cases, particularly the cases that occurred in \nthe 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, were not solved because they never were \ninvestigated and because no effort was made to solve them.\n  Currently, the Civil Rights Division does investigate those cases. We \ncertainly applaud the efforts both of the Civil Rights Division and in \nmany cases of local prosecutors who have cooperated. We are not \nsuggesting the Civil Rights Division is not trying to investigate those \ncases now. In many instances, they are.\n  This is what we are hearing from advocates and family members of \nthose who have been murdered in the past. They tell us they are working \nwith the Justice Department and in many cases are pleased with their \nresponse. But what we do not have is a regularized, systematic \ncommitment on the part of the Government to find the truth in these \ncases. We do not have a set of people who are dedicated to doing that \nand nothing else.\n  We think it is very important to do this for several reasons. In the \nfirst place, a section of people who are dedicated to that task will \ndevelop a forensic expertise in investigating those kinds of cases that \nyou are not going to get if you occasionally investigate them but do \nnot do it on a regular basis.\n  In the second place, we think once the section exists and it becomes \nknown to the public, it will encourage people to come forward with \ninformation, people who might have been afraid to do so to this point, \nbut they will know this Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Section is there, \nthis cold case section is there. They will contact that section and \ngive them information about past offenses and tragedies.\n  Finally, we think the existence of this section will cause those who \ncommitted these crimes--and in some cases who are still walking around \nin the belief they are beyond justice--to not rest easy anymore. As my \nfriend from Connecticut has said, we want them to sweat. We want them \nto know the Government is trying to find them, that there is a section \nof the Government that is out to get them for the murders they may have \ncommitted 40 or 50 years ago or for which they may have been complicit, \nfor which they may have believed they were safe from investigation. So \nwe think there are a lot of advantages to this section.\n  I will say a little bit about the history of it. I was having a \ndiscussion with a man named Alvin Sykes. Alvin is a nationally \nrecognized civil rights advocate from Kansas City, who has been very \nactive in getting the Emmett Till case from mid-1950s reopened, trying \nto achieve justice in that case. We were talking about that \ninvestigation. We were working on that issue. He said: Why don't we \nhave a regularized procedure for looking at cases such as the Emmett \nTill case?\n  This was the case of a young man from Chicago who went to visit his \nuncle in Mississippi. He was kidnapped, beaten, murdered, and his body \nwas dumped in the river because he had allegedly, the day before, \nwhistled at a white woman. The two men who were responsible for that \nwere tried actually, but after about 60 minutes of the jury's \ndeliberations, they were acquitted. They subsequently had interviews \nwith national magazines in which they basically admitted their \ncomplicity, admitted their guilt, and they were never prosecuted. They \ndied, unfortunately, without being brought to justice. But there are \nothers maybe who were complicit who could be brought to justice. There \nare a lot of those cases out there such as this. We believe a section \nsuch as this will bring them to light and do justice.\n\n[[Page S10027]]\n\n  Mr. Sykes said: Why don't we have a section like this? There is not \nany reason we shouldn't.\n  So the bill creates this cold case section, if you will, of the Civil \nRights Division, requiring they investigate these murders and requiring \nthey report back to the Congress. In some cases they will find the \ntruth and be unable to prosecute anybody, but at least they will \nuncover the truth and be able to report back and tell us that. Or if \nthey have not been able to uncover the truth, at least they will do \ntheir best, at least we will have done our best, even at this late \ndate, to achieve justice in these cases.\n  I think that is very important for two reasons. The first reason is, \nwhen you talk to the family members of those who were victimized, those \nwho were in these cases, you realize that the fact the case was 40 or \n50 years ago does not mean it has been forgotten. These family members \nhave been unable to reach closure on these cases. They have been unable \nto put them behind them and move on because there is this tremendous \ntragedy that occurred where they lost somebody because of a vicious \ncrime. They feel as though the rest of society has not taken an \ninterest in bringing the criminals to justice. We have a chance to \nallow these family members to find out the truth, and to move on in \ntheir own lives. We owe them that. The country owes them that.\n  The country needs closure as well. We need to know what happened, and \nwe need to know, as a country, that we did the best we could in a \nsystematic and planned way to find out the truth in these cases, to \nbring those to justice where justice is possible, and to mourn with the \nsurvivors of these victims, to know the truth, and then be able to pull \ntogether and move forward. This bill allows us to do that.\n  I thank very much the managers of the bill on both sides of the \naisle, as well as Senator Specter and Senator Leahy for their support. \nWe have not gone through the Judiciary Committee in doing this, but \neverybody felt it was important to get this done, and that this was the \nbill we could use as a vehicle for doing it.\n  I think there are a lot of people around the country who have been \nworking tirelessly to get these cases reopened for whom this is going \nto be the most encouraging news they have had in a long time.\n  I hope my colleagues will take satisfaction in having done a very \ngood thing and having struck this blow for justice, struck this blow \nfor having an opportunity to close these cases and move forward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and defer to my good friend from \nConnecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first, I commend my colleague and friend \nfrom Missouri. He is a tireless fighter and a persistent advocate. \nUnder normal procedures we would not be adding a proposal such as this \nto an appropriations bill. Therefore, I must begin by expressing our \nsincere gratitude to the Chairman and the ranking Democrat of this \nsubcommittee on appropriations for both of their willingness to accept \nan authorizing bill of this nature. Their willingness to accept what I \nthink is a very sound and good proposal by the Senator from Missouri, \nmyself, and others who have joined in this effort, is something for \nwhich we are very grateful. I thank them for their willingness to \nentertain this proposal and to accept it as an amendment to this bill.\n  There are those who would say this amendment is a case of ``too \nlittle, too late.'' In some ways they are right. Where is the justice, \nI suppose, when a moral monster such as Edgar Ray Killen roamed free \nfor literally decades after killing young civil rights workers in this \ncountry? That fact alone speaks to the excusable failures of our legal \nsystem to bring to justice those who committed brutal crimes.\n  As the Senator from Missouri pointed out, not that many years ago \nthese crimes were rarely investigated in parts of our country. There \nwas no effort made whatsoever to determine who engaged in these brutal \nviolent acts. In more recent history, of course, we have seen a strong \neffort. I applaud those who engage in this effort.\n  The Senator from Missouri and I believe there is a good justification \nfor dedicating an adequate amount of resources with some special \ndesignation to go back and reopen the books. Those who engaged in these \nactivities, who think they never have to worry another day in their \nlives about being pursued, take note--take note that you may never and \nshould never have a sleep-filled night again, that we will pursue you \nas long as you live, that we will do everything in our power to \napprehend you and bring you to the bar of justice.\n  That is the message we want to convey to the families, the friends, \nand others who lost loved ones, who put their lives on the line by \nadvocating a greater justice, helping our Nation achieve that ``more \nperfect union'' that our Founders spoke about, that Abraham Lincoln \narticulated brilliantly more than a century and a half ago.\n  That is at the heart of all this--to try to level this field. We will \nnever be a perfect union, but each generation bears the responsibility \nfor getting us closer to that ideal.\n  America stands for the principle of equal justice for all. Yet for \nfar too long, many Americans have been denied that equal justice, and \nmany despicable criminals have not been held accountable for what they \nhave done to deprive people of those equal opportunities. This is a \nfailure we can never forget.\n  So this Senate, in this Congress, on this date, early in the 21st \ncentury, is saying that we will not forget. This amendment is on \nrecord. This amendment seeks to right the wrongs of the past and to \nbring justice to people who perpetrated these heinous crimes because of \nracial hatred. We are saying that we want to create the mechanism to \nallow us to pursue these wrongdoers in the coming years. It cannot \nbring back and make whole those who have suffered and were murdered by \na racist criminal hand. But it can reaffirm our Nation's commitment to \nseek the truth and to make equal justice a reality.\n  The hour is, obviously, very late. Memories are dimming. Those who \ncan bring some important information to the legal authorities are \npassing away. This amendment may be the last and best chance we have as \na nation to write a hopeful postscript in the struggle for racial \nequality in our Nation.\n  We urge our friends in the House of Representatives, the other body, \nto accept this idea, to join with us in this late hour to right these \nwrongs done in our recent past.\n  Again, my compliments to my friend from Missouri.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am here this afternoon to salute the \nSenator from Missouri for his tireless work on this piece of \nlegislation and to applaud also the Senator from Connecticut who has \nbeen a leader for civil rights legislation in this country for a long \ntime. I thank them both not only for their initiative, for thinking of \nthis, but also for pushing it and being persistent about it. I can \nremember when the Senator from Missouri came to me on the floor months \nago talking about it. I thank them both for giving me a chance to be an \noriginal cosponsor and for their hard work on shepherding it through \nthe Senate in this way.\n  The Senator from Connecticut pointed out that it has not been that \nlong since these crimes have happened. In my lifetime, it has not been \nthat long. I was a student in the South in the 1950s. I was a college \nstudent at Vanderbilt University in Nashville when it was still \nsegregated. I helped to try to desegregate it--successfully. In that \nsame year, in the early 1960s, Congressman John Lewis was trying to sit \nin. He could not get a seat for lunch. In that same year, the judge on \nthe Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans for whom I worked a \nfew years later, Judge John Minor Wisdom, had ordered Ole Miss to admit \nJames Meredith.\n  In those years, when African-American families drove through \nNashville, if they were sick, they could not be admitted to many of the \nhospitals; if they needed a place to sleep, they could not be admitted \nto many of the motels; if they needed a place to eat, they could not go \nto many of the restaurants. That was the life then. That was not that \nlong ago. Many families\n\n[[Page S10028]]\n\nthroughout the South, as well as other parts of the country, but \nthroughout the South, lived in fear because of that climate.\n  The Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act will help heal some of the scars \nthat have been left on our society in the wake of the civil rights \nstruggle.\n  This past June, shortly after Edgar Ray Killen was convicted for the \n41-year-old murder of three civil rights workers, the Nashville City \nPaper ran an editorial that summed up why resolution of these cases is \nso important, and why this legislation by Senator Talent and Senator \nDodd is so important. The editorial concluded:\n\n       As long as Civil Rights era killers are still alive and \n     free, justice has not yet been fully served. Hunting them \n     down and bringing them to account for their actions is far \n     and away the best apology any of us can make for their \n     crimes.\n\n  This is not leadership by lament. This is leadership by action. I \ncommend the Senate for taking such positive steps toward recognizing \nand rectifying these injustices.\n  This action is a reflection of one of those aspects of our Nation's \ncharacter that distinguishes us in the world. We dedicate ourselves to \nhigh ideals. We have since our very beginning. Sometimes we have failed \nto live up to those ideals. But when we do, we have most often \nrecommitted ourselves and taken action to correct our shortcomings. \nTherefore, we abolished slavery. Therefore, we granted women the right \nto vote, even though it was after many years. Therefore, we \ndesegregated our schools. Today we shall add to that litany that we \nhave taken steps to bring to justice criminals of the civil rights era. \nJustice delayed is justice denied. Today we see to it that justice will \nbe delayed no longer.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation, and I look forward \nto the day when this new office opens its doors in the Department of \nJustice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the continuing scenes of the suffering and \ndevastation in New Orleans and across the Gulf Coast weigh heavily on \nour hearts and minds. It is clear that as a nation we have a monumental \nchallenge ahead of us to rebuild and restore one of America's most \nunique and important regions. There is the challenge of repairing and \nreplacing the physical infrastructure of a number of cities, including \nthe great city of New Orleans. There is also the challenge of restoring \njobs and income and opportunity and hope to hundreds of thousands of \ndesperate and displaced people.\n  Hurricane Katrina did more than rip the roofs off buildings along the \nGulf Coast. It also ripped off the mask that has covered up the plight \nof millions of working Americans who live in poverty, as well as nearly \none out of every five American children who are now growing up in \npoverty. Too often the poor are out of sight and out of mind. Katrina \nchanged that. Hurricane Katrina opened the eyes of people all across \nthis country. The poor are now in sight and on our minds. Americans are \nshocked. Frankly, we are ashamed that such desperation and deprivation \ncould exist on such a large scale in the wealthiest nation on Earth. \nAmericans expect more, and we deserve more.\n  Those of us who are working in the cool air-conditioned buildings of \nWashington have to take a long, hard look at the priorities and choices \nthat have contributed to a situation where Americans, moms and dads, \nhusbands and wives, people of all walks of life, work hard but still \nare unable to make ends meet and still live in poverty. One might think \nthat we would be so embarrassed about these misplaced priorities that \nhave contributed to this situation that we would change course, that we \nwould do all we can to support those who work hard to make ends meet.\n  One would think that reordering priorities would be especially \nimportant in our efforts to rebuild the Gulf Coast, to restore jobs and \ncreate new opportunity, get income into people's pockets so they can \nrebuild their lives and jump start the local economy.\n  Unfortunately, as if we had learned nothing at all, one of the very \nfirst actions taken by President Bush in the wake of this storm was to \nissue an executive order suspending the Davis-Bacon Act, the Federal \nlaw that requires employers on Federal projects to pay employees the \nprevailing wage of that area. This is a law that has been supported by \nevery President since Franklin Roosevelt, Republican and Democrat.\n  Even more disturbing, if press reports are to be believed, the \nPresident is apparently planning to compound the damage by also \nrescinding what is known as the McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act \nwhich contains similar wage protections for employees working on \nFederal service contracts. It is a law that goes back over 50 years.\n  Until now, I have muted my voice. I have not criticized the President \nnor anyone else on what has happened in New Orleans and what happened \nin the wake of Katrina. I have said that the time for that would come \nlater. For now, it is time to get food and shelter and clothing and \nhealth care to the people so devastated. That is why I am so \ndisappointed with this action by the President which will negatively \nimpact workers' wages. So, while we need to set up a separate \ncommission to look at what happened in the aftermath of the hurricane, \nwhy the planning was not done, why so much suffering and death before \npoor people were moved to places of safety, the fact is things are now \nmoving ahead.\n  With the stroke of a pen, the President is going to remove the \nrequirement for the prevailing wage to be paid for workers in this \nregion. If press reports are to be believed, he is now going to \ncompound it by rescinding the McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act that \nwould apply that prevailing wage to Federal service contracts.\n  This is exactly the wrong way to put the Gulf Coast region back on \nits feet. Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama already have low wage \nlevels compared to the rest of the Nation. For example, the current \nprevailing wage in the New Orleans area for a truck driver working on \nrebuilding the levees is $9.04 an hour. In the New Orleans area, the \nprevailing wage for an electrician is $14.30 an hour. Think about it. \nThat comes to an annual income of barely $18,000 a year for a truck \ndriver and about $28,000 a year for an electrician working full time. \nIt is hard enough for a family to rebuild their lives in that \ndevastated area at that income. Why in the world would the President \nwant to slash that income, especially at this time?\n  Let's look at some more of the workers who would be negatively \nimpacted by this action. We are talking about sheet and metal workers \nin Pearl River County, MS, who currently make less than $19,000 a year. \nThat is their prevailing wage. We are talking about carpenters in \nMobile County, AL, who currently make less than $20,000 a year. We are \ntalking about laborers in Livingston Parish, LA, who make less than \n$20,000 a year. At this time, why would we want to cut their already \nmeager income? These are the very workers we will be counting on to \nrebuild the highways and bridges, reconstruct houses and schools and \nhospitals, get our electricity up and running again in all those areas. \nThese are the workers who will do the hazardous waste cleanup. Their \nwages are already barely at the poverty line. The President's actions \nwill drive those wages down even lower.\n  Given the conditions these people will be working in--areas rife with \nbacteria and mold, chemical contaminants--we ought to be giving them a \nwage premium to work in these areas. Instead, the President's action \nwill give them a wage cut. This policy fails the basic test of fairness \nand equity. Is the President calling for a cap on executive salaries? I \nhaven't heard him call for that. Is there any effort to see if the \ncompanies involved in the cleanup and rebuilding would be willing to \naccept less than the normal profit? I see that one of the first no-bid \ncontracts let was to Halliburton.\n\n  We know who the former president of Halliburton is: Vice President \nDick Cheney. We know that one of the chief clients of the former head \nof FEMA, Mr. Albaugh, who now has a consulting firm, is Halliburton. We \nknow that Mr. Albaugh's hand-picked successor, Mr. Brown, was the head \nof FEMA when they gave the no-bid contract to Halliburton. It sounds \nlike a sweetheart deal to me. Is the President calling for a cap on \nprofits earned by those companies? Of course not. So why in the world \nis the President singling out low-income workers in that area and \nsaying: We are not just going to put a cap\n\n[[Page S10029]]\n\non what you make. We are going to lower prevailing wage. We are going \nto take it away. Why is he cutting their pay at a time when we should \nbe trying to boost income and give a helping hand to people in this \narea?\n  For the life of me, the more I think about this, the more I read \nabout it, I don't get what the President is trying to do. They have a \nprevailing wage. He is saying, you are not going to get that. What \nhappens when you don't have a prevailing wage in a desperate situation? \nThere is always somebody worse off than you that will take a job at \nless pay. There is always somebody a little bit more desperate. So if \nthe prevailing wage for a truckdriver was $9 an hour, if there is no \nprevailing wage, the company could come in and say: Anybody want a job \nfor $8 an hour? Someone says: Yes, I will take it for $7. Someone else \nwill say I will take it for $6 because I am so desperate. I need work. \nI need income.\n  You end up with a race to the bottom on the wages these jobs pay if \nyou don't have that prevailing wage. That is precisely what is going to \nhappen in New Orleans and the Gulf Coast region. It is a blow to the \nworkers who have already lost their homes. Many have lost jobs, \nfamilies disrupted, coming back to clean up the mess in their \nneighborhoods. Now they are being told their wages are going to fall. \nThink about this. Before Katrina, a truckdriver would be making $9.04 \nan hour. Post-Katrina, they will get less money. Can someone please \nexplain to me what sense this makes? Pre-Katrina we pay you more for \nthe work you do; post-Katrina, we are going to pay you less.\n  I say to the President of the United States: You are going to be on \ntelevision tomorrow night to talk about the cleanup effort. Please \nexplain to the American people why it is you took away the prevailing \nwage for workers. Explain why it is necessary for them to make less now \nthan they made before. Explain why it is necessary to cap their wages, \nbut we don't cap the profits of the companies doing the work. We don't \ncap the executive salaries of the executives of those companies.\n  This is devastating. I have held my criticism of the President, but \nthis is unconscionable. This is not right. It is not right for \nindividuals, and it is foolish economic policy for a region that we are \ntrying to get back on its feet. FEMA is already signing scores of \ncontracts for vast sums of money. The question is: Will a fair share of \nthis money work its way down to the ordinary laborers who do the dirty, \nhazardous jobs of cleanup and rebuilding? Or will it mostly go for \nexecutive salaries and corporate profits? Certainly, we do not want a \nreplay of Iraq, where billions of dollars in contracts have been \nawarded, enriching people at the top, but with precious little \ntrickling down to ordinary Iraqis to put income in their pockets and \nencourage a grassroots economic recovery.\n  Surely we can learn from the mistakes we made in Iraq where we just \nthrew billions of dollars to these companies, and not much of it got \ndown to the people in Iraq. Surely we can learn from that and not \nrepeat those mistakes in the Gulf Coast.\n  The good news is that it is not too late for the President to correct \nthis misdirection. We are still at the beginning of our response to the \ndevastation of Hurricane Katrina. As we saw when the FEMA Director was \nreassigned earlier this week and has since left, of course, the \nPresident and his team have shown a capacity for shifting gears and \nmaking midcourse corrections. That is fine.\n  Tomorrow night, the President needs to take a second midcourse \ncorrection in the strongest possible terms. I urge the President to use \nhis prime-time address to the Nation to reverse course and reinstate \nthe Davis-Bacon protections for the Gulf Coast region.\n  I also urge the President to put in place a network of auditors and \noverseers to ensure that the billions of dollars going to Katrina \nrelief is spent effectively, that the lion's share is used to restore \nand create jobs, to boost incomes, to spark a bottom-up economic \nrecovery and revival all across the devastated region.\n  There have been numerous articles written in the days since Katrina \nhit the Gulf Coast underscoring how shocked Americans are to see with \nour own eyes the poverty and the deprivation that unfortunately still \nexists on a large scale in the wealthiest Nation on Earth. We need to \naddress the issue of poverty in this country. We knew before Katrina \nstruck. We saw the data. The U.S. Census Bureau issued updated poverty \ndata showing that 37 million live in poverty--13 percent of our \npopulation. Since 2001, 4 million more Americans have fallen into \npoverty. Nearly 5 million more Americans are without health insurance. \nAnd worst of all, poverty is increasing sharply among the working poor, \npeople who have full-time jobs. The Census Bureau's numbers show that \nover the last year alone, the number of Americans who work but live in \npoverty increased by 563,000 people--over half a million. Meanwhile, \nthe latest Census numbers show that over the last year, real median \nearnings fell by nearly $1,000 for male workers, more than $300 for \nfemale workers.\n  It should offend our basic sense of fairness to know there are any \nAmericans working full time, playing by the rules, and still living in \npoverty. Once again, it is not too late to act. Katrina can serve as a \nwake-up call to all of us to reorder our priorities, as I said earlier.\n  Before Katrina, people in the Congress, the leadership, the \nRepublicans in Congress were poised to slash food stamps and Medicaid \nfor the poor at the same time that we were supposed to get a bill to \neliminate the estate tax and extend other tax cuts for the wealthiest \nAmericans. Prior to Katrina, their agenda consisted of coming back here \nand cutting food stamps, cutting Medicaid for the poor, cutting estate \ntaxes, giving more tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans. Let's hope \nKatrina has been a wake-up call that these are misordered, wrong \npriorities. They would have been misordered before Katrina, and they \nare glaringly misguided in a post-Katrina America. We should be \nfocusing on initiatives that lift people out of poverty, not slashing \nprograms that provide health care and food support to working families.\n  We must increase the minimum wage, which today is not even a living \nwage but a poverty wage. We need to increase education and job training \nopportunities. We need to be making college loans and grants more \nwidely available and cheaper. We need to be strengthening the ladder of \nopportunity that allows people to achieve their own American dream. We \ncannot do that if we keep doing what we have been doing--if we keep \ncutting taxes for the wealthiest of Americans, then turning around and \ncompensating for the deficit created by those huge tax loopholes by \nslashing food stamps and Medicaid and taking away the prevailing wage \nfor workers in the Gulf Coast region.\n  I close my statement by, again, calling upon President Bush to do a \nmidcourse correction. I don't know who advised you, Mr. President, to \nuse your pen to cut the prevailing wages for our workers in the Gulf \nCoast region. Whoever advised you, they were wrong. Now is your time to \ndo a midcourse correction. Tomorrow night, when you address the Nation, \nMr. President, tell the American people that you are going to reinstate \nthe prevailing wage for our workers in the Gulf Coast. In fact, give \nthem a premium for all the dirty, hard work they'll have to do. And \nthen don't suspend the act that also provides a prevailing wage for our \nservice workers because they are going to be doing a lot of the hard \nwork also in cleaning up the mess in New Orleans and around the Gulf \nCoast region.\n  It would be a terrible thing if we take hard-earned taxpayers' \ndollars that we are committing to rebuilding the Gulf Coast region, to \nrebuilding the economy and helping people rebuild their lives--it would \nbe a slap in the face to the American taxpayer if we allow that money \nto go disparately into the pockets of the executives of the companies \nthat get all the contracts, and in turn cut the wages of the workers \nwho will be physically doing the hard work and the heavy lifting. That \nis not the America that we want post-Katrina.\n  Mr. President, tomorrow night, do the right thing: change your \ncourse.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMINT). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S10030]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Hurricane Katrina may be the worst natural \ndisaster in my lifetime, maybe in modern memory. The stories that come \nback from that hurricane and that disaster are so touching. Today, a \nman was rescued in his home. It was reported in the news that had he \ngone another day without water, he would have died. It is amazing that \nhe survived through these weeks since Hurricane Katrina struck.\n  Senator Mary Landrieu, our colleague from Louisiana, came back with \nso many real-life stories that were so touching. There is one she told \nme and several others that I repeated back in my home State of \nIllinois. It is an amazing story about a 65-year-old woman who was \nliving alone in a simple house in New Orleans and had nowhere to go and \nno way to leave. She thought her little house, which had been through \nan awful lot, could take whatever God would give, and she was relieved \nwhen the hurricane skirted around New Orleans.\n  Within hours, of course, disaster struck in the form of a flood. She \ntold Mary Landrieu, who found her in one of the hospital facilities, \nthat the water just came rushing in, first 4 feet of it, and then more. \nAs it was rising, she was wondering where she would turn. She went \nthrough her house and thought maybe, just maybe she could crawl up into \nthe attic. She set a stepladder up in her kitchen, but she did not have \nthe strength to move from her stepladder up into the attic. She could \njust barely get her head up into the attic. The water rose to the \nceiling, to her chin, while she was standing on that stepladder. She \nstood on that stepladder for 2 days. She told Mary Landrieu that she \nkept wondering why the level of the water was changing every once in a \nwhile. Of course, it was the tidal flow of the water from the Gulf of \nMexico, the tidal flow in her kitchen.\n  Finally, one of her neighbors thought about her, came and helped her \nout, and the two of them scrambled up to the roof. With a little help, \nshe survived to tell the story.\n  She told Mary Landrieu that in those dark hours, standing on that \nladder with water up to her chin, she survived on faith, faith in God \nbut faith in the belief that someone would come to help her.\n  For many people in New Orleans and Mississippi and Alabama and \nthroughout the State of Louisiana, that someone was our Government. \nPeople knew that at the worst moments they could count on our \nGovernment to be there because our Government is our American family \nand we do pull together. When one part of our family is in distress, we \npull together to help. And she waited and waited and waited.\n  A doctor I met in Chicago on Friday at one of the evacuee centers \nhappened to be in New Orleans on Monday when the hurricane and then the \nflood hit. He said he didn't see his first rescue worker until Thursday \nin the city of New Orleans. He was lucky. He was on high ground in a \nhotel--a doctor. He really became the head of a small hospital in that \nhotel.\n  Something awful happened as a result of this hurricane. Too many \npeople were left behind. Too many people were let down. The most \nvulnerable people in America didn't have their Government, their \nAmerican family standing there to help them in their greatest hour of \nneed.\n  For a long time there was a political exchange back and forth in \nWashington: Who is at fault? Who made the mistake? The talk shows, the \ntalking heads, all of them had an opinion. The White House said: Don't \nget involved in a blame game. That was their phrase. Many others said \nit really wasn't the Federal Government's fault, it was this, it was \nthat. It went on and on.\n  Senator Mikulski, who just came back to the floor, managing an \nimportant bill, was one of the first, if not the first, who came to the \nfloor and suggested the head of FEMA should move on to another job.\n  Senator Mikulski, thank you for your leadership. He is gone. I joined \nher in that chorus. Whatever Mr. Brown's qualifications were, they were \nnot up to the job of handling this natural disaster.\n  The President came out within the last day and conceded the fact that \nhe had not met his responsibility to the American people in Hurricane \nKatrina. That is an important admission on his part. I think, once \nhaving conceded that point, we can move forward.\n  I come to the floor now because the Senate missed an extraordinary \nopportunity to move forward on a bipartisan basis today. There was an \namendment offered by Senator Hillary Clinton of New York, who certainly \nknows about disasters, having lived through 9/11 with her colleague, \nSenator Schumer. Senator Clinton came to the floor today and said: We \nlearned a lesson on 9/11 that if you really want to get to the bottom \nof what failed in Hurricane Katrina and what we can do to repair the \ndamage in the future, to make certain that the American Government and \nthe American family stand behind its most vulnerable members, we need \nan independent 9/11-type commission, a bipartisan commission that will \ntake an honest look. Don't load it up with Congressmen and Senators who \nmay have some political axe to grind but make it truly independent.\n  It worked for 9/11. The two men who were chosen, Gov. Tom Kean, \nformer Republican Governor of New Jersey, and Congressman Lee Hamilton, \nformer Democratic Congressman from Indiana, did an extraordinary \nservice for our country. Their analysis of 9/11 led to the most \nsignificant intelligence reform in modern history in our country, and \nit passed with an amazing, strong, bipartisan vote, thanks to the \nexceptional work of Senator Susan Collins, a Republican of Maine, and \nSenator Joe Lieberman, a Democrat of Connecticut, and Congresswoman \nJane Harman of California. They all came together with this \nintelligence reform that grew out of this independent commission.\n  Senator Clinton came to the floor today and said it worked well for \nAmerica's greatest terrorist attack. Let us apply the same concept, the \nsame model for this Hurricane Katrina disaster.\n  We had a chance on a bipartisan basis to rise to the occasion today, \nand we failed. We failed to pass the Clinton amendment. On a partisan \nrollcall, Senator Clinton's call for an independent commission was \nrejected. Why? Why? When you consider the devastation of this \nhurricane, when you consider the billions of dollars that need to be \nspent now to bring back these communities and the families and the \nlives, why, when we know that we want to be prepared tomorrow, God \nforbid, if another disaster strikes? Why wouldn't we follow Senator \nClinton's suggestion? Why wouldn't we create this independent, \nbipartisan commission that can get to the heart of the issue?\n  The American people want this, and the Senate rejected it on a \npartisan rollcall today. That is truly unfortunate. Those who lived \nthrough 9/11 recently commemorated a sad fourth anniversary. The lives \nof those who were lost, of course, will never be reclaimed. Their \nmemories live on. But their families have dedicated themselves, not \njust to preserving their memory but to doing something important for \nAmerica. Those families stood behind the 9/11 Commission. They were the \npolitical force that kept that commission moving forward when \npoliticians on both sides of the aisle found plenty of excuses to stop.\n\n  We need another group of families today. We need the Hurricane \nKatrina families to come forward. We need for them to say to this \nSenate, the House of Representatives, and this Government, we truly \nneed another independent commission. We need their voices and we need \ntheir strength. I think with it, we will succeed.\n  Today, Senator Clinton, despite her best efforts, did not succeed. \nBut for the good and safety and security of this Nation, we must.\n  I look forward to returning to this issue as quickly as possible. I \nhope we can find a way to not only analyze what we failed to do with \nHurricane Katrina but make certain we bring the relief and recovery \nfamilies need and make America safe again for so many vulnerable \nAmericans who count on our leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, first I would like to thank the senior \nSenator from Illinois for his kind words about my advocacy.\n\n[[Page S10031]]\n\n  You see, I wanted not only new leadership at home--that is why I \ncalled for Michael Brown to step down--but I believe FEMA needs a new \nfocus. It needs a new energy. And it needs a new independence.\n  In the 1990s I worked to form FEMA, after Hurricane Andrew, and \nactually worked with President Bush (I) and Andrew Card. We started \nthat. President Clinton came in, we kept our reform efforts up, we got \nJames Lee Witt, and what we really focused on was, No. 1, that FEMA \nbecome independent; No. 2, that it be run by professionals--meaning \nemergency management, military, or even private sector people with \ncrisis management experience because this is enormously important to \nsaving lives, saving livelihoods, and quite frankly, being good \nstewards of taxpayer money. We are about to spend $60 billion, and we \nare into no-bid contracts? OK?\n  So that is why I wanted Brown to go. The President has appointed \nsomeone. I look forward to getting acquainted. I supported the \ncommission, not to finger-point, but to pinpoint, just like the 9/11 \nCommission. Where do we need to reform? Where do we need to \nreinvigorate? Where do we need to refocus?\n  Yes, the President is going to look into it, and he should. Yes, the \nCongress is going to look into it, under the able leadership of Senator \nCollins and Senator Lieberman. But I believe in independence. Frankly, \nas you know, I say to the Senator, just as in medicine, nothing goes \nwrong when you get a second opinion from outside. So that is what I \nhoped would happen. But I look forward to working with the President on \nrecovery.\n  We have to make sure we are ready and able to respond if it happens \nagain. Thank you for your kind words.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last night, Senator Baucus and I \nintroduced a package of tax relief measures designed to help the \nvictims of Hurricane Katrina both in the short and long term. We know \nthat tax incentives helped to revitalize New York after 9/11. They can \ndo the same for New Orleans, Gulfport, and the other hurricane-hit \nareas. We're pleased that members of the affected region join us in \nthis effort including Senators Lott, Landrieu, Vitter, Cochran, and \nShelby.\n  The immediate relief package that we are announcing today will help \nget short-term aid to hurricane victims by encouraging food donations \nand the employment of displaced individuals, for example. For those who \nhave suffered casualty losses, we have liberalized the tax rules to \npermit affected taxpayers to deduct losses from damaged property. We \nalso want to help protect Katrina victims from undeserved IRS \nharassment.\n  We expect to see prompt action by Congress on this tax relief \npackage. We need to get these tax incentives on the books and help \nKatrina victims make a fresh start.\n  After this package is completed, our focus will be on longer term tax \nincentives to help rebuild homes and businesses. We are looking at \ndepreciation changes, tax-exempt bond authority--arbitrage rebate--and \nenterprise-zone initiatives.\n  Life will never be the same for our fellow citizens in gulf region. \nAnd what we have all seen over the last 2 weeks will stay in the hearts \nand minds of all of us for years to come.\n  With this first initiative from the Finance Committee--and there will \nbe more in other areas where we have jurisdiction--we want the victims \nin all of the affected areas to know that they can count on us to \ncreate a set of measures that wit1 help return vitality and vigor to \nthe gulf region.\n\n\n                            NOTICE OF INTENT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in accordance with rule V of the standing \nrules of the Senate, I hereby give notice in writing on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Bingaman that it is our intention to move to suspend \nparagraph 4 of rule XVI for the purpose of proposing to the bill, H.R. \n2862, The Science, State, Justice, Commerce Appropriations Bill, the \nfollowing amendment: No. 1706.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1660\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, Congress must make an immediate, thorough \nreview of the Government's response to Hurricane Katrina and its \naftermath.\n  As a member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, I am committed \nto working with Chairwoman Susan Collins and Ranking Member Joe \nLieberman to ensure that the investigation is conducted in a bipartisan \nfashion.\n  We have already begun this investigation. On Wednesday, September 14, \nour committee held its first hearing on the effects of Hurricane \nKatrina and heard from former California Gov. Pete Wilson, former New \nOrleans Mayor Marc Morial, and former Grand Forks, ND, Mayor Patricia \nOwens. Each of these respected public officials have led their citizens \nthrough past natural disasters and shared their experiences with us in \nthe hearings.\n  In the coming weeks, we will call in leaders from the administration \nand other relevant parties to determine what was done right and what \nwas done wrong in responding to Hurricane Katrina. We intend to make \nwhatever changes in structure, funding and personnel that are necessary \nto ensure that we are prepared to handle disasters--either natural or \nmanmade--in the future.\n  During consideration of the fiscal year 2006 Commerce-Justice-Science \nappropriations bill, Senator Hillary Clinton offered an amendment to \ncreate a new committee to investigate Hurricane Katrina. I did not \nsupport this amendment for two reasons. First, it violated Senate rules \nby adding legislation to an appropriations bill. I have strongly \nopposed such legislative ``riders'' in the past since many of the \n``riders'' have been used to undermine environmental laws. I believe \nthat legislation should move through the appropriate authorization \ncommittees for consideration.\n  Second, I believe that our Homeland Security Committee is doing the \nnecessary work to conduct a full investigation. The work has already \nbegun. A new committee could take months to be organized and set up. \nThe American people should not have to wait to have accountability.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1670\n\n  Mr. CHAFFEE. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the Senate \namendment No. 1670, offered by Senator Dorgan. Earlier today the Senate \nheld a procedural vote on this amendment, and I want to make clear the \nreason for my vote.\n  Senator Dorgan's amendment would create a Special Committee of the \nSenate on war and reconstruction contracting. It is modeled on the \nhighly successful committee that former President Harry Truman chaired \nduring his Senate tenure from 1941-1944. That committee demanded the \nstrictest accountability from defense contracting and thus saved our \nGovernment billions of dollars.\n  I agree with the aim of Senator Dorgan's amendment, and look forward \nto supporting legislation in the future that would establish a special \ncommittee to review war and reconstruction contracting. Given the great \ncost, length and importance of the war on terrorism, I think it is \nappropriate to convene such a special committee to ensure that taxpayer \ndollars are spent wisely.\n  However, Senator Dorgan offered this piece of authorizing legislation \non an appropriations bill. The procedural vote was whether the Senate \nshould set aside rule XVI, which prohibits such authorizing on \nappropriations. There is a troubling history of legislating on \nappropriations. From 1995, when the Senate voted in effect to over-turn \nrule XVI, until 1999, when the rule was established, there was a \nproliferation of so-called ``legislative riders'' on appropriations \nbills. No authorizing committee's territory is safe without firm lines \nclearly differentiating between authorizing work and appropriations \nwork. Moreover, from 1995-1999 many of the riders were aimed at \nundermining environmental laws.\n  To avoid returning to this practice, I support rule XVI and its \nprohibition against adding authorizing amendments to appropriations \nbills, and thus voted to oppose Senator Dorgan's amendment. Again, I \nstate this to make clear that my vote was to uphold an important Senate \nrule, and not to oppose Senator Dorgan's amendment.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1688, as Modified\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that \namendment No. 1688, which was submitted by Senator Stabenow, be \nmodified with\n\n[[Page S10032]]\n\nthe changes that are at the desk and, further, that the amendment be \nconsidered and agreed to with the motion to reconsider laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1688), as modified, was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available in this Act may \n     be used to include in any new bilateral or multilateral trade \n     agreement the text of--\n       (1) paragraph 2 of article 16.7 of the United States-\n     Singapore Free Trade Agreement;\n       (2) paragraph 4 of article 17.9 of the United States-\n     Australia Free Trade Agreement; or\n       (3) paragraph 4 of article 15.9 of the United States-\n     Morocco Free Trade Agreement.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY.

The amendment is now pending.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1715 to Amendment No. 1671\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. We have a second-degree amendment which has been agreed \nto on both sides. Therefore, on behalf of Senator DeWine, I send the \nsecond-degree amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Shelby], for Mr. DeWine, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1715 to amendment No. 1671.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 1 strike line 6 and all that follows through page \n     2, line 2, and insert the following:\n\n     $859,300,000 shall be available for aeronautics research and \n     development programs of the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration. Of the amount available under this section in \n     excess of $852,300,000, not more than 50 percent of such \n     excess amount may be derived from any particular account of \n     the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1662\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I now ask for the regular order with \nrespect to Sarbanes amendment No. 1662.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. SHELBY.

Mr. President, I rise to make two brief comments \nregarding Egypt and Moldova.\n  On Egypt, the jury is still out on whether or not the recent \npresidential election is a meaningful step toward greater democracy in \nthat country. To be sure, there was plenty wrong with the poll which \nfew Egyptians were permitted to access and no international monitors \nwere allowed to observe. President Mubarak's victory was unsurprising. \nIt is important to encourage President Mubarak to appreciate that \nprogress in Egypt, whether relating to freedom, economic development, \nor Radio Sawa broadcasts, must be judged not by words but by concrete \nactions. The Egyptian people deserve no less, particularly with \nlegislative elections on the horizon later this year.\n  On Moldova, I am pleased that the Senate State, Foreign Operations \nand Related Programs Subcommittee provided an additional $3 million \nabove the Fiscal Year 2006 budget request for that country, a mark \nworthy of defending in conference. Credible elections in March \ndemonstrated that the country's political leaders are interested in \nEuropean integration and increased political and economic reforms. I \nencourage that country to implement proposed reforms relating to the \nindependence of the judiciary and media, transparency in parliamentary \nproceedings, participation in elections, local self-government, \nlegislative oversight of the executive, and protection of human and \ncivil rights. Such action will demonstrate the seriousness of Moldova's \nintentions and strengthen its partnerships with the United States and \nEurope.\n  I look forward to continued democratic progress in Egypt and Moldova.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/14/senate-section/article/S10032-3", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10032-S10033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HONORING CHIEF JUSTICE WILLIAM H. REHNQUIST\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I join in acknowledging the life and \nservice of Chief Justice William Rehnquist.\n  His was a life of public service. During the Supreme Court's 1951 and \n1952 terms, he served as a law clerk for Justice Robert Jackson. From \n1969 to 1971, he served as Assistant Attorney General in the Justice \nDepartment's Office of Legal Counsel. And from January 7, 1972, to his \npassing Saturday, he served on the Supreme Court. Through his life of \nservice, Justice Rehnquist has left an indelible mark on this Nation.\n  In 1969, on appointing Judge Burger as Chief Justice of the Supreme \nCourt, President Nixon had said: Our Chief Justices have probably had \nmore profound and lasting influence on their times and on the direction \nof the nation than most Presidents.\n  President Nixon was right. And the service of Chief Justice Rehnquist \nwas proof.\n  In 1971, President Nixon nominated Justice Rehnquist to the Supreme \nCourt as an Associate Justice. And in 1986, President Reagan elevated \nhim to the position of Chief Justice. In the history of this Nation, \nonly 16 men have held this high office. Justice Rehnquist presided over \nthe court as Chief Justice for 19 years. Only three men served longer \nas Chief Justice: Melville Weston Fuller, Roger Taney, and John \nMarshall.\n  I felt a tie with Justice Rehnquist, as he had attended Stanford \nUniversity and Stanford Law School, a few years ahead of me at both \nschools. In another one of those quirks of history, he attended the \nsame Stanford Law School class with Sandra Day O'Connor, who would \nlater join him on the Supreme Court.\n  I was also able to observe Chief Justice Rehnquist at close range, in \n1999, when he presided over the Senate sitting in the Presidential \nimpeachment trial of President Clinton. Chief Justice Rehnquist had \nwritten a book on impeachments. But more importantly, his presence \nbrought dignity and a much-needed sense of humor to those difficult \nproceedings.\n  At one point, he noted that a Senate rule forbids both sides in the \nimpeachment trial from objecting to a question.\n  From the Presiding Officer's chair, the Chief Justice wryly observed: \nThe Parliamentarian says they can only object to an answer and not to a \nquestion, which is kind of an unusual thing.\n\n[[Page S10033]]\n\n  The Chief Justice chuckled, and Senators laughed with him.\n  At another point, Majority Leader Lott asked how much time each side \nhad used. The Chief Justice checked with the Parliamentarian and first \nannounced that the House Managers had taken 54 minutes and the White \nHouse had taken 57 minutes. But then the Chief Justice said that he \nneeded to correct himself, saying that the House managers had actually \nused up 64 minutes, not just 54 minutes.\n  House Manager Rogan, who was scheduled to speak next, inquired: I \ntrust that doesn't mean I have to sit down, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  The Chief Justice quipped in response: It's not retroactive.\n  Mr. President, Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote many opinions with which \nI do not agree. He was a very conservative Justice.\n  But I will miss Chief Justice Rehnquist. He was a great figure of our \ntimes. We will not forget him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/14/senate-section/article/S10033-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On June 15, 2005, Dwan Prince was savagely beaten by three men as \nPrince stood outside of his apartment building in New York, NY. The \napparent motivation for the attack on Prince was his sexual \norientation. According to police, the three attackers shouted antigay \nslurs throughout the attack on Prince.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that are born out of hate. The Local \nLaw Enforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. \nI believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/14/senate-section/article/S10033-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE CANDY STORE FOR GUNS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have consistently supported commonsense \nlegislation to help stop the flow of guns to the black market. \nUnfortunately, the failure of Congress to act on several commonsense \nbills has allowed criminals and terrorists continued potential easy \naccess to guns. In addition to endangering our families and communities \nhere in the United States, congressional inaction may also be helping \nto fuel international trafficking of powerful firearms.\n  Earlier this year, the CBS news program ``60 Minutes'' aired a \nsegment about the activities of an arms merchant who legally purchased \nhigh-powered weapons here in the U.S. and smuggled them to the Kosovo \nLiberation Army to be used in their fight for independence from Serbia. \nAccording to him, the weapon of choice for the KLA was the .50-caliber \nsniper rifle.\n  Published reports indicate that .50-caliber sniper rifles are capable \nof accurately hitting a target more than 1,500 yards away with a bullet \nmeasuring a half inch in diameter. In addition, these thumb-size \nbullets come in armor-piercing, incendiary, and explosive varieties \nthat can easily punch through aircraft fuselages, fuel tanks, and \nengines. Under current law, .50-caliber sniper rifles can be purchased \nby private individuals with only minimal Federal regulation. In fact, \nthese dangerous weapons are treated the same as other long rifles \nincluding shotguns, hunting rifles, and smaller target rifles.\n  ``60 Minutes'' pointed out that this one individual made use of his \neasy access to .50-caliber sniper rifles and other high-powered weapons \nto help outfit the KLA. He said: Anything you need to run a small \nguerrilla army, you can buy here in America. You have all the guns you \nneed here to fight a war.\n  He continued: All the rifles which U.S. soldiers use in every war, \nyou can buy them in a gun store or a gun show.\n  While he would not discuss the total number of .50-caliber rifles he \nshipped out of the country, the author of a book about the subject \nestimated the number to be several hundred. The author told ``60 \nMinutes'' that on one occasion, the arms merchant and his associates \nhid nearly one hundred .50-caliber sniper rifles in a shipment of \nhumanitarian aid to Albanian refugees.\n  For their report, ``60 Minutes'' also interviewed Joe Vince, a former \nsenior official at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and \nExplosives. He commented on our Nation's gun laws by saying: We are the \ncandy store for guns in the world. And it's easy for people to acquire \nthem here.\n  During his interview, Mr. Vince called for computerized records of \ngun sales that would allow law enforcement officials to look for \npatterns of buying activity for high-powered firearms including .50-\ncaliber sniper rifles. This approach may be helpful for identifying the \ngun trafficking operations that arm criminals in our country as well as \nthose that support militants in other parts of the world, including \nterrorists.\n  I have cosponsored the Fifty-Caliber Sniper Weapon Regulation Act \nintroduced by Senator Feinstein. This bill would reclassify .50-caliber \nrifles under the National Firearms Act, treating them the same as other \nhigh powered or especially lethal firearms like machine guns and sawed \noff shotguns. Among other things, reclassification of .50-caliber \nsniper rifles under the NFA would subject them to new registration \nrequirements. Future transfers or sales of .50-caliber sniper rifles \nwould have to be conducted through a licensed dealer with an \naccompanying background check. In addition, the rifle being sold would \nhave to be registered with Federal authorities.\n  We have a responsibility to those we represent as well as to other \nnations to help stop dangerous firearms from falling into the hands of \npeople who seek to use them for violence. I am hopeful that the \nCongress will recognize the danger of inaction and pass legislation to \nrequire registration of military style firearms like the .50-caliber \nsniper rifle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/14/senate-section/article/S10033-3", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TAIWAN-UNITED STATES AGRICULTURAL AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, every 2 years or so, an agricultural \nbuying mission from Taiwan visits the United States, to sign letters of \nintent and contracts to buy billions of dollars worth of U.S. wheat, \ncorn, soybeans and hides. As you can well imagine, this practice has \nhelped to guaranty an income to farmers across the country, and helped \nto create jobs in communities throughout this Nation.\n  Between 1978 and 1993, Taiwan dispatched 18 of these missions to this \ncountry. Taiwan has an active ``buy American'' program, which has \nhelped to shrink our trade deficit over the years. Hopefully, this \nrobust trading relationship between Taiwan and the United States will \ncontinue for years to come. I know for a fact that our farmers and \nexporters, especially from my home State of Kansas, deeply appreciate \nTaiwan's business.\n  Our friends in Taiwan have helped this country in other ways as well. \nWhether it is full cooperation in the global war on terror, significant \nmonetary contributions to the Twin Towers Fund, or their recent \ngenerous pledge of $2,000,000 in aid for the victims of Hurricane \nKatrina, we can always count on Taiwan to be there when we need them.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to thank our friends in Taiwan as they \nonce again demonstrate their good will towards the United States \nthrough the visit of this agricultural buying mission to my State, as \nwell as those of many of my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/14/senate-section/article/S10033-4", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10033-S10034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   COMMMORATION OF THE 200TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTH OF CONSTANTINO \n                                BRUMIDI\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, this is such a happy occasion and I am \ndelighted that so many of you who know the importance of this \nextraordinary artist-citizen's work could join us. I want to thank \nSpeaker Hastert and Senator Stevens, as well as our leaders in the \nSenate, Senator Frist and Senator Reid, my colleague Senator Enzi, \nCongressmen Pascrell and Bilirakis, and of course Ambassador Boggs. It \nis so wonderful that we are here in this historic building, where \nAmericans can see the best of our democracy in action. I often just \nshake my head and\n\n[[Page S10034]]\n\nwonder as I walk through the Capitol--its beauty, its iconic power \nreally defy my attempts at articulation. More than any other building, \nit is the exterior of the Capitol that we associate with the freedoms, \nvalues, and privileges of American citizenship. But on the inside we \ntell so many stories about who we are as a people, what our aspirations \nand our dreams might be.\n  Constantino Brumidi was 47 years old, a painter, when he came to our \nshores. As is often the case with the immigrant experience, he landed \nhere with nothing but a dream, and within a relatively short period of \nyears he was here at the Capitol, using his talent and the great \ntradition that he exalted, to turn the interior of our Capitol into \nsomething much more alive and real than just the walls and the columns \nthat held it up. He had a Greek father, an Italian mother; some might \nvery well say the best of both worlds. And the coincidence should not \nbe lost on us, that classical wall painting, the medium of which he was \na master, originated in Greece and reached a high degree of refinement \nduring the Roman Republic. So he brought with him his classical \ntraining and influences and he became a master of that tradition. He \nbelieved that the Capitol required, as he put it, ``a superior style of \ndecoration in real fresco, like the palaces of Augustus and Nero.'' In \nthe Brumidi biography, by Capitol curator Barbara Wolanin, she so aptly \nwrites, ``his originality lay in integrating American themes into his \nclassical repertoire. He was inspired by the great Renaissance artist \nRaphael, and he emulated his design of scrolls and leaves with birds \nand animals, but the species of squirrels and mice he painted in the \nSenate Wing corridors were strictly American.''\n  He spent 25 years painting in the Capitol Building, but that was not \nhis only commission. One of his most notable other great works is found \nin New York, at the Church of Our Lady of the Scapular and Saint \nStephen, which is in the Gramercy Park area of Manhattan. My \npredecessor, Senator Moynihan, recognized the importance of Brumidi's \nwork at Saint Stephen's years ago. Commissioned in 1866, Brumidi \npainted a huge mural of Christ's crucifixion over the church's high \naltar, in addition to 43 murals and paintings around the walls. He was \nacclaimed for this work, and you can see why as you look through the \nCapitol, and I also hope you will also visit Saint Stephen's. The \nchurch is engaged in an important effort to preserve Brumidi's work, \nand I personally hope that this ceremony and the 200th anniversary of \nhis birth will help draw attention to that effort.\n  As we have learned from years of effort, preserving and restoring \nBrumidi's work is enormously important. For decades it was obscured by \nmoisture and leaks, and gas torch light residue, but finally in the \n1980s and the 1990s his work had begun to be restored to its original \nsplendor. I remember coming in late at night in the Capitol on numerous \noccasions in the past 10 or 15 years and seeing the restorers working \nso meticulously to preserve and enhance and once again reveal the full \nbeauty of his work.\n  Yes, he was an artist-citizen. He used his artistry on behalf of his \ncitizenship, and he used his citizenship to elevate his art. He is \nreported to have said, ``My one ambition and my daily prayer is that I \nmay live long enough to make beautiful the Capitol of the one country \non Earth in which there is liberty.'' I believe his daily prayer was \nanswered and I am delighted that so many of us could be here to \nrecognize and celebrate the 200th anniversary of his birth, but even \nmore the work he did which has stood the test of time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/14/senate-section/article/S10034-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         MEMORIAL FOUNDATION FOR THE BLIND'S 100TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the Memorial \nFoundation for the Blind in Worcester, MA as they celebrate a century \nof good deeds in the Commonwealth. I would especially like to \ncongratulate the board of directors on this special day, led by \nPresident Lawrence M. Raymond and Vice President Janet LaBreck. Without \nthe board's leadership and dedication this day may not have been \npossible.\n  For most of our Nation's history, blind and visually impaired men and \nwomen, like all people with disabilities, were treated like second-\nclass citizens. They had fewer opportunities to succeed in school and \nwork and participate in the life of their communities, and their \nspecial needs were too often considered a burden without remedy and not \nworth addressing.\n  Since those dark days, enormous progress has been made in promoting a \nlife full of possibilities for blind and visually impaired men and \nwomen. Leaders like Helen Keller changed hearts and minds by showing us \nall that what is often seen as a limitation can be a blessing in \ndisguise. But much of the credit also goes to local organizations such \nas the memorial foundation, that cared about these basic issues and \nstood up for civil rights. It represents the best in progressive \nphilanthropic organizations that changed communities one at a time, and \nencouraged the rest of the Nation to follow suit. Their great legacy is \na stronger and fairer America.\n  In Worcester County, the foundation operated a special home and \nprovided support services for many years, making sure that a safe and \nwelcoming shelter existed in the community. In 1960 it shifted its \nfocus to providing financial assistance to one and later on to many \nagencies and organizations in the community that exemplify its giving \nspirit. They continue to do so today, adapting to new developments, \nsupporting assistive technologies and giving blind and visually \nimpaired men and women unprecedented new independence.\n  This new century holds great promise for further extraordinary \nprogress, especially in the area of employment. I am proud to join the \nmemorial foundation in its ongoing efforts for greater justice and \nequality. You represent the very best in our Commonwealth and our \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/14/senate-section/article/S10034-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10034-S10035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       SALUTE TO EDWIN LEE ALLEN\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of the \n95th birthday later this week of a truly beloved Iowa artist, Lee \nAllen.\n  Born in Muscatine on September 16, 1910, Edwin Lee Allen has called \nIowa home for his entire life. The son of an engineer, Lee was raised \nwith a unique blend of curiosity and problem-solving ability. As a \nyoung boy, his father gave him a set of oil paints and Lee quickly \ndeveloped into an excellent artist. At the age of 18, Lee won a blue \nribbon for oil painting at the Iowa State fair. Another artist who won \nan award at that fair was Grant Wood, later to become famous for his \npainting ``American Gothic.'' Lee and Grant Wood became friends and, as \ndirector of a Federal fine arts project during the Depression, Grant \nWood asked Lee to work for him.\n  In 1935, Lee studied under Diego Rivera in Mexico City. Upon \nreturning to Iowa City, Lee won a competition to paint murals for post \noffices. Two were produced. One, ``Soil Conservation,'' still hangs in \nthe Onawa post office, and another, ``Conservation of Wildlife,'' hangs \nin the Emmetsburg post office. ``Soil Conservation'' was selected for \nthe American Century exhibit at the Whitney Museum of American Art in \n1999.\n  In 1937, Lee began working for the University of Iowa as a medical \nillustrator in the Eye Department. He quickly distinguished himself as \na medical illustrator, but also made many contributions to the medical \nprofession. For example, in 1941, frustrated with then-current \ngonioprisms, Lee developed the ``Allen-Thorpe Goniprism,'' which was \nsold by the Bausch and Lomb Company. He also developed the ``Allen \nDot'' which diminished flare and reflections on cameras designed for \nphotographing eyes.\n  Following World War II, Lee began making artificial eyes. And in \n1976, he retired from the University of Iowa to open his own company, \nIowa Eye Prosthetics. Using the same scientific mind and artist's \nskill, Lee revolutionized the process of making artificial eyes. His \ndevelopment of the ``painting lens'' allowed ocularists--artificial eye \nartisans--to develop incredibly comfortable and life-like artificial \neyes. His Iowa Eye Implant provided for a very natural eye movement. \nBecause of Lee's success and dedication, today artificial eyes look \nevery bit as natural as the real thing.\n  Throughout his career, Lee continued to paint and win awards, and his \nart hangs in museums across the country.\n\n[[Page S10035]]\n\n  Today, Lee is fully retired and lives in Iowa City, welcoming the \nopportunity to spend time with his three daughters, Loredo, Mary Lee, \nand Elizabeth. I wish him the best on this his 95th birthday, and thank \nhim for his contributions to art, medicine, and America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/14/senate-section/article/S10035-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ICE AGE NATIONAL SCENIC TRAIL\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the 25th \nanniversary of the Ice Age National Scenic Trail, which will be \nobserved later this week but officially occurs on October 3, 2005. This \nanniversary is an appropriate time to celebrate not just the \nbreathtaking beauty of our natural surroundings or the accomplishments \nof and opportunities provided by a cherished unit of the National Park \nService over the past 25 years. It also gives us the chance to mark the \nachievements that are possible when a dedicated group of volunteers \ncommit themselves to a long-term vision of improving their environment, \ntheir communities, their State, and their country.\n  Much of North America's landscape was formed by retreating ice sheets \nsome 15,000 years ago and the beauty this retreat exposed surrounds \neach of us. However, it is the two-thirds of Wisconsin that were shaped \nduring this glacial movement whose majestic beauty is, quite simply, \nunmatched. I know that all Wisconsinites appreciate the special places \nthat owe their existence to these glacial changes--from our thousands \nof inland lakes and streams to our meandering eskers and rolling \nmoraines, and from the top of Timm's Hill down to the gravelly shores \nof Lake Michigan.\n  Wisconsin's geological history communicates a fascinating story and \nthe Ice Age National Scenic Trail helps to both preserve that story, by \nprotecting the scenic beauty, and to tell that story, by allowing \npeople the opportunity to explore it. The trail, which starts in Green \nBay, follows the path of the Wisconsin Glaciation, stretches for more \nthan 1,000 miles across the State, and finally ends at the Interstate \nState Park Ice Age Reserve Unit at the Dalles of the St. Croix River. \nThroughout its meanderings, the trail takes you on a journey like no \nother.\n  In addition to learning about the geological history of Wisconsin, a \nvisitor to the trail will find a multitude of recreational \nopportunities. These activities can be equally enjoyed by individuals \nseeking solitude and by groups and families who want to increase their \ntogetherness. All areas on the Ice Age Trail encourage hiking and \nbackpacking, and some portions permit non-motorized sports such as \nbicycling, horseback riding, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, and \njogging. I cannot think of a better place to engage in these activities \nthan along the Ice Age Trail.\n  The stories associated with the trail aren't only about the \ngeological history of our State. The trail also tells the story of \nindividuals working to fulfill a dream. In the 1950s, the late Ray \nZillmer, of Milwaukee, envisioned a trail spanning across Wisconsin's \nglacial landscape. In 1958, the Ice Age Park and Trail Foundation was \nformed by a grassroots movement of Wisconsin citizens interested in \npromoting the creation of a national park that would recognize the \nglacial footprint in Wisconsin. These citizens' efforts were finally \nrecognized when, in 1971, the State of Wisconsin cooperated with the \nNational Park Service to create the Ice Age National Scientific \nReserve. Finally, in 1980--over 20 years after Mr. Zillmer's work \nbegan--Congress recognized the national significance of our landscape \nand the importance of sharing it with the country and designated the \nIce Age Trail as a National Scenic Trail.\n  Our trail is administered jointly by the Wisconsin Department of \nNatural Resources, the Ice Age Park and Trail Foundation, and the \nNational Park Service, but it is the efforts of volunteers that truly \nmake the trail shine. From those as young as 11 to those in their 70s, \nI salute the volunteers who are committed to improving our Ice Age \nNational Scenic Trail. Their actions carry on the vision of past \nWisconsinites to leave their surroundings a bit better off than they \nfound them.\n  Over the past 25 years, the trail has flourished. It has grown \ntremendously and today there are many segments proposed for inclusion. \nI can't wait to watch as the next 25 years go by. In fact, I look \nforward to participating in the 50th anniversary celebration!\n  In closing, I congratulate the Ice Age National Scenic Trail on its \n25th anniversary and commend all those associated with it for their \nefforts to make it one of the most outstanding parts of the National \nTrails System.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/14/senate-section/article/S10035-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH DAKOTA SCHOOL OF MEDICINE \n                          AND HEALTH SCIENCES\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \noutstanding achievements of the School of Medicine and Health Sciences \nat the University of North Dakota, UND, as it celebrates 100 years of \nexcellence, innovation and service. On September 30 through October 1, \nthe students, faculty, and alumni of the UND School of Medicine and \nHealth Sciences will gather to celebrate their institution's history \nand founding.\n  As the only medical school in the State of North Dakota, the School \nof Medicine and Health Sciences has played a key role in ensuring \naccess to quality health care in our region. When the School was \nestablished by the North Dakota State Legislature in 1905, most of the \nState's citizens were farmers living in areas with little or no medical \ncare. Throughout the past 100 years, the UND School of Medicine and \nHealth Sciences has maintained its focus on training health \nprofessionals that seek to practice in rural areas. The school has \neducated nearly half of all practicing doctors in North Dakota and \nalmost 80 percent of the physician assistants and physical and \noccupational therapists. The school has also trained medical doctors \nand other health professionals for service on reservations through its \nIndians Into Medicine program.\n  One of the most notable offices within the School of Medicine and \nHealth Sciences is the Center for Rural Health. As one of the Nation's \ntop resources for rural health research and policy, the Center for \nRural Health has been recognized again and again for its work in \nstudying and improving rural health. The center is home to the Nation's \nonly Rural Assistance Center, a clearinghouse for rural health \nproviders and communities to access the full range of funding and \nresearch opportunities.\n  The School of Medicine and Health Sciences has also focused resources \non medical research. As one of eleven nationwide sites with the \nadvanced technology to study neurodegenerative diseases, the school has \nutilized its scientists and resources to study diseases and conditions \nthat affect people in the Midwest region, including diabetes, cancer, \nfetal alcohol syndrome, and Parkinson's. Over the past 10 years, the \nschool has attracted nearly $30 million in Federal grant funding.\n  The UND School of Medicine and Health Sciences has provided a century \nof excellence, innovation, and service to not only its students and \nfaculty, but to the entire State of North Dakota. The school has grown \nand expanded over the past 100 years, but has remained committed to \neducating future health care providers. I ask the Senate to join me in \ncongratulating the School of Medicine and Health Sciences on its first \n100 years of service to North Dakota and in wishing it well as it \nembarks on the next century. By honoring the UND School of Medicine and \nHealth Sciences, we recognize the unique contributions that smaller, \ncommunity-based medical schools have made to our Nation's health care \nsystem, particularly in rural areas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/14/senate-section/article/S10035-3", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10035-S10036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  At 9:38 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker of \nthe House of Representatives has signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 252.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 1697. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nthe Hope Scholarship Credit to cover fees, books, supplies, and \nequipment and to exempt Federal Pell Grants and Federal supplemental \neducational opportunity grants from reducing expenses taken into \naccount for the Hope Scholarship Credit; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, Senator Smith and I are introducing \nlegislation today that would allow more students in our Nation to take \nfull advantage of the Hope Scholarship Tax Credit.\n  Since it was signed into law by President Clinton in 1997, the Hope \nScholarship Tax Credit has annually helped millions of students reduce \nthe cost of going to college. In 2003 alone, more than 7.3 million \ncollege students claimed this and the Lifetime Learning tax credit. \nThis credit, which can be as much as $1,500, has helped families offset \nthe increasing cost of college--costs that have gone up 51 percent at \npublic 4-year colleges, 36 percent at private 4-year colleges and 26 \npercent at public 2-year colleges over the past decade.\n  Unfortunately, many students and their families are unable to take \nadvantage of the maximum amount of the credit because it is limited to \ncovering ``tuition and related expenses.'' Students that attend \ncolleges with lower tuition costs, such as those at many of our \nNation's community colleges, are not entitled to the maximum amount of \nthe credit. As we all know, tuition is just one of the many expenses \nassociated with going to college. Room, board, books, supplies, \nequipment and fees can be prohibitively expensive for those who attend \ncolleges that have reasonable tuition charges.\n  The bill addresses this inequity, by allowing the Hope scholarship \ntax credit to cover expenses associated with fees, books, supplies, and \nequipment. To limit the bill's cost, a student's room, board and \nrelated expenses would remain excluded. It is important to note that \nthe Tax Code commonly recognizes non-tuition expenses, including \nsubstantial living expenses, in programs such as section 529 plans and \ntax-exempt, pre-paid tuition plans. Our bill, reasonably, covers a much \nmore limited subset of these same expenses.\n  In addition, the legislation changes the Tax Code so that any Federal \nPell grants and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants \nstudents receive are not counted against their eligible expenses when \nHope eligibility is calculated. This change will provide some \nassistance to needier students, especially those attending 4-year \npublic colleges. However, since the Hope tax credit will remain non-\nrefundable, the costs of these changes will remain low.\n  Both of these modest changes will make college more affordable to \nmany students and families that do not currently benefit from many of \nthe other tax provisions that are targeted to more wealthy families. \nFor many of these students, the ability to get the maximum amount of \nthe tax credit may be the difference in the student being able to take \nan additional class or not having to sit out a semester.\n  This legislation is supported by the American Council on Education, \nthe United States Student Association, the American Association of \nCommunity Colleges, the American Association of State Colleges and \nUniversities, the National Association of State Universities and Land \nGrant Colleges, the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities, \nthe Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, and a number of \nother prominent higher education organizations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Lugar):\n  S. 1698. A bill to accelerate efforts to develop vaccines for \ndiseases primarily affecting developing countries and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this week world leaders are meeting at the \nUnited Nations to reaffirm the commitments made five years ago under \nthe United Nations Millennium Declaration, including the commitment to \nhalt and begin to reverse by the year 2015 the spread of HIV/AIDs, \nmalaria, and other major diseases that claim the lives of millions of \npeople around the world every year. We still have a long way to go if \nwe are going to meet this challenge.\n  AIDS, which has already claimed the lives of 20 million people, \ncontinues to be the leading cause of premature death in sub-Saharan \nAfrica. An estimated 39 million people worldwide are infected with HIV. \nLast year alone, 4.9 million people were newly infected with HIV, and \n3.1 million died. For years, the epidemic was focused on sub-Saharan \nAfrica, but now HIV is spreading fastest in Central Europe and in parts \nof Asia.\n  Although the AIDS pandemic has gripped the world's notice, other \ndiseases such as malaria and tuberculosis have drawn less attention--\nbut they too are deadly, particularly for those in the world's poorest \ncountries. Malaria claims the lives of a million people annually, many \nof them young children; ninety percent of these deaths occur among \npeople living in sub-Saharan Africa. Tuberculosis, once thought to be \neradicated, has reemerged in new and more drug resistant strains. An \nestimated 1.7 million people now die annually from TB. Because those \nliving\n\n[[Page S10040]]\n\nwith HIV or AIDS are particularly vulnerable, the number of TB cases \nhas been growing rapidly in sub-Saharan Africa and Central Europe.\n  Taken together HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria kill over 5 million people \nannually. A human crisis of this proportion demands that we respond \nwith urgency and thoughtfulness. We must continue to support robust \nprevention, treatment and care programs. But we must also recognize \nthat vaccines are the most effective weapons in the arsenal of modern \nmedicine to stop the threat of AIDS and other infectious diseases that \nare decimating the developing world. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology \ncompanies, however, are reluctant to invest in research for vaccines \nfor these diseases because they fear that the market will not be \nlucrative enough to cover the costs of research and development\n  The bill that I am introducing today, Vaccines for the New Millennium \nAct of 2005, is designed to address this problem by providing \nincentives for these companies to accelerate their efforts to develop \nvaccines and microbicides to prevent HIV/AIDS, TB, malaria and other \nneglected diseases. It builds upon legislation that I introduced in \n2001 with Senator Frist. I am pleased that the Chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, Senator Lugar, is joining me in introducing this \nnew, expanded bill.\n  The bill provides a variety of economic incentives. First, it \nmandates that the Secretary of the Treasury enter into negotiations \nwith the World Bank, the International Development Association, the \nGlobal Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations, and other interested \nparties in order to establish advanced market commitments, AMCs, for \nthe purchase of vaccines and microbicides to combat neglected diseases. \nResearch has shown that the major obstacle to the development of \nvaccines for these diseases is the absence of a market because these \ndiseases hit hardest in poor countries that cannot afford to buy the \nvaccines. Advanced market commitments AMCs are designed to remove this \nobstacle by creating the market ahead of time. AMCs would be legally \nbinding contracts to purchase a vaccine or microbicide at a fair market \nprice for a guaranteed number of treatments, thereby creating a market \nincentive for a company to invest in the development and production of \nvaccines for these diseases. The international framework for the AMCs \nwould also include clearly defined requirements for eligible vaccines \nto ensure that they are safe and effective as well as clearly defined \nand transparent rules of competition. The bill also mandates that the \nSecretary establish a purchase fund in the Treasury as soon as a \nvaccine to combat one of these diseases is available.\n  Second, the bill supplements the market incentive with a variety of \ntax incentives designed to provide appropriate and equitable incentives \nto both large pharmaceutical and small private sector companies to \nstimulate vaccine development. The bill provides a 30 percent tax \ncredit each year on qualified research expenses to develop microbicides \nfor HIV and vaccines for HIV, TB, malaria and other neglected diseases \nthat kill more than 1 million people annually. This is an expansion of \nthe existing R tax credit and can be applied to clinical trials \noutside of the United States, since the majority of those infected with \nthese diseases are beyond our borders.\n  It provides a refundable tax credit to small biotechnology companies \nbased on the amount of qualified research that they do in a given year. \nThis credit is designed to stimulate research among the firms that are \nthe most innovative and to ensure that assistance is given to those \nsmall companies that need it the most. Increased research efforts by \nthese firms could be instrumental to the effort to develop effective \nvaccines for neglected diseases, particularly for HIV/AIDS.\n  And it provides a 100 percent tax credit on contracts and other \narrangements for research and development of these vaccines and \nmicrobicides. This credit, which is an increase over the 65 percent \ncredit now in the tax code, is designed to serve as an incentive to \nlarger pharmaceutical companies to work hand in hand with the smaller \nbiotech companies to pick up the pace of vaccine development.\n  Once vaccines are developed, it is imperative that they be widely \ndistributed. The bill that I am introducing today with Senator Lugar \nalso addresses the distribution side of the equation. It provides a 100 \npercent tax credit to companies on the sales of new vaccines and \nmicrobicides as long as those sales are made to a qualified \ninternational health organization or foreign government for \ndistribution in developing countries\n  Finally, the bill sets up a pilot program under the Small Business \nAct to encourage the development of vaccines and microbicides by \neligible companies under the auspices of the Small Business Innovation \nResearch, SBIR, and the Small Business Technology Transfer, STTR, \nprograms in US government agencies with a global health or disease \nprevention mission. Under this pilot program, these agencies have new \nauthority to undertake outreach activities to eligible biotech firms \nand other small business to promote the objectives of the pilot \nprogram.\n  In recent years, a number of pharmaceutical companies have taken \nsteps to help in the treatment of those infected with AIDS by providing \nlife-extending therapies to the developing world at reduced costs. \nThese drugs are critically important but the war against AIDS cannot be \nwon unless we develop vaccines against the HIV virus and other \nneglected diseases. The pharmaceutical and biotech companies hold the \nkey\n  Many steps need to be taken in the war against these diseases. This \nbill focuses on only one area but a critically important one: vaccine \ndevelopment and distribution. If the public and private sectors work \ntogether with energy and commitment, I believe we can develop the \nvaccines, and once developed, we will win the war against these deadly \ndiseases that victimize so many in the developing world.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n                                S. 1698\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Vaccines for the New \n     Millennium Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) AIDS.--The term ``AIDS'' has the meaning given the term \n     in section 104A(g) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 \n     U.S.C. 2151b-2).\n       (2) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n     ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the Committee \n     on Appropriations and the Committee on Foreign Relations of \n     the Senate and the Committee on Appropriations and the \n     Committee on International Relations of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (3) Developing country.--The term ``developing country'' \n     means a country that the World Bank determines to be a \n     country with a lower middle income or less.\n       (4) HIV/AIDS.--The term ``HIV/AIDS'' has the meaning given \n     the term in section 104A(g) of the Foreign Assistance Act of \n     1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151b-2).\n       (5) Global alliance for vaccines and immunizations.--The \n     term ``Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations'' means \n     the public-private partnership launched in 2000 for the \n     purpose of saving the lives of children and protecting the \n     health of all people through the widespread use of vaccines.\n       (6) Neglected disease.--The term ``neglected disease'' \n     means--\n       (A) HIV/AIDS;\n       (B) malaria;\n       (C) tuberculosis; or\n       (D) any infectious disease (of a single etiology), which, \n     according to the World Health Organization, causes more than \n     1,000,000 deaths each year in developing countries.\n       (7) World bank.--The term ``World Bank'' means the \n     International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Immunization is cheap, reliable, and effective, and has \n     made a profound impact on global health, in both rich and \n     poor countries.\n       (2) During the 20th century, global immunization efforts \n     have successfully led to the eradication of smallpox and the \n     elimination of polio from the Western Hemisphere, Europe, and \n     most of Asia. Vaccines for diseases such as measles and \n     tetanus have dramatically reduced childhood mortality \n     worldwide, and vaccines for diseases such as influenza, \n     pneumonia, and hepatitis help prevent sickness and death of \n     adults as well as children.\n       (3) According to the World Health Organization, combined, \n     AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria kill more than 5,000,000 \n     people a year, most of whom are in the developing\n\n[[Page S10041]]\n\n     world, yet there are no vaccines for these diseases.\n       (4) It is estimated that just 10 percent of the world's \n     research and development on health is targeted on diseases \n     affecting 90 percent of the world's population.\n       (5) Economic disincentives result in little private sector \n     investment in vaccines for neglected diseases, a situation \n     which disproportionately affects populations in developing \n     countries.\n       (6) Of more than $100,000,000,000 spent on health research \n     and development across the world, only $6,000,000,000 is \n     spent each year on diseases that are specific to developing \n     countries, most of which is from public and philanthropic \n     sources.\n       (7) Infants, children, and adolescents are among the \n     populations hardest hit by AIDS and malaria, but they are at \n     risk of being left behind in the search for effective \n     vaccines against such diseases.\n       (8) Providing a broad range of economic incentives to \n     increase private sector research on neglected diseases, \n     including increased public and private sector funding for \n     research and development, guaranteed markets, tax credits, \n     and improved regulatory procedures would increase the number \n     of products in development and the likelihood of finding \n     effective vaccines for such diseases.\n\n     SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON SUPPORT FOR NEGLECTED DISEASES.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the President should continue to encourage efforts to \n     support the Global HIV Vaccine Enterprise, a virtual \n     consortium of scientists and organizations committed to \n     accelerating the development of an effective HIV vaccine;\n       (2) the United States should work with the Global Fund to \n     Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the Joint United \n     Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (``UNAIDS''), the World Health \n     Organization, the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, and \n     the World Bank to ensure that all countries heavily affected \n     by the HIV/AIDS pandemic have national AIDS vaccine plans;\n       (3) the United States should support and encourage the \n     carrying out of the agreements of the Group of 8 made at the \n     2005 Summit at Gleneagles, Scotland, to increase direct \n     investment and create market incentives, including through \n     public-private partnerships and advance market commitments, \n     to complement public research in the development of vaccines, \n     microbicides, and drugs for HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, \n     and other neglected diseases;\n       (4) the United States should support testing of promising \n     vaccines in infants, children, and adolescents as early as is \n     medically and ethically appropriate, in order to avoid \n     significant delays in the availability of pediatric vaccines \n     at the cost of thousands of lives;\n       (5) the United States should continue supporting the work \n     of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations and the \n     Global Fund for Children's Vaccines as appropriate and \n     effective vehicles to purchase and distribute vaccines for \n     neglected diseases at an affordable price once such vaccines \n     are discovered in order to distribute them to the developing \n     world; and\n       (6) the United States should work with others in the \n     international community to address the multiple obstacles to \n     the development of vaccines for neglected diseases including \n     scientific barriers, insufficient economic incentives, \n     protracted regulatory procedures, lack of delivery systems \n     for products once developed, liability risks, and \n     intellectual property rights.\n\n     SEC. 5. PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Creative partnerships between governments and \n     organizations in the private sector (including foundations, \n     universities, corporations including pharmaceutical companies \n     and biotechnology firms, community-based organizations and \n     other nongovernmental organizations) are playing a critical \n     role in the area of global health, particularly in the fight \n     against neglected diseases, including HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, \n     and malaria.\n       (2) Public-private sector partnerships increase local and \n     international capacities to improve the delivery of health \n     services in developing countries and to accelerate research \n     and development of vaccines and other preventive medical \n     technologies essential to combating infectious diseases that \n     disproportionately kill people in developing countries.\n       (3) These partnerships maximize the unique capabilities of \n     each sector while combining financial and other resources, \n     scientific knowledge, and expertise toward common goals which \n     cannot be achieved by either sector alone.\n       (4) Public-private partnerships such as the International \n     AIDS Vaccine Initiative, the Malaria Vaccine Initiative, and \n     the Global TB Drug Facility are playing cutting edge roles in \n     the efforts to develop vaccines for these diseases.\n       (5) Public-private partnerships serve as incentives to the \n     research and development of vaccines for neglected diseases \n     by providing biotechnology companies, which often have no \n     experience in developing countries, with technical assistance \n     and on the ground support for clinical trials of the vaccine \n     through the various stages of development.\n       (6) Sustaining existing public-private partnerships and \n     building new ones where needed are essential to the success \n     of the efforts by the United States and others in the \n     international community to find a cure for these and other \n     neglected diseases.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the sustainment and promotion of public-private \n     partnerships must be a central element of the strategy \n     pursued by the United States to create effective incentives \n     for the development of vaccines and other preventive medical \n     technologies for neglected diseases debilitating the \n     developing world; and\n       (2) the United States government should take steps to \n     address the obstacles to the development of these \n     technologies by increasing investment in research and \n     development and establishing market and other incentives.\n       (c) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to \n     accelerate research and development for vaccines and \n     microbicides for neglected diseases by substantially \n     increasing funding for public-private partnerships that \n     invest directly in research, such as the International AIDS \n     Vaccine Initiative, the Malaria Vaccine Initiative, and the \n     Global TB Drug Facility, and for partnerships such as the \n     Vaccine Fund that incentivize the development of new vaccines \n     by purchase existing vaccines.\n\n     SEC. 6. COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY FOR ACCELERATING THE \n                   DEVELOPMENT OF VACCINES FOR NEGLECTED DISEASES.\n\n       (a) Requirement for Strategy.--The President shall \n     establish a comprehensive strategy to accelerate efforts to \n     develop vaccines and microbicides for neglected diseases such \n     as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. Such strategy shall--\n       (1) expand public-private partnerships and the leveraging \n     of resources from other countries and the private sector;\n       (2) include initiatives to create economic incentives for \n     the research, development, and manufacturing of vaccines for \n     HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and other neglected \n     diseases;\n       (3) include the negotiation of advanced market commitments;\n       (4) address intellectual property issues surrounding the \n     development of vaccines and microbicidies for neglected \n     diseases;\n       (5) maximize United States capabilities to support clinical \n     trials of vaccines and microbicidies in developing countries;\n       (6) address the issue of regulatory approval of such \n     vaccines, whether through the Commissioner of the Food and \n     Drug Administration, or the World Health Organization or \n     another internally-recognized and agreed upon entity;\n       (7) expand the purchase and delivery of existing vaccines; \n     and\n       (8) address the challenges of delivering vaccines in \n     developing countries in advance so as to minimize historical \n     delays in access once vaccines are available.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 270 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to the \n     appropriate congressional committees a report setting forth \n     the strategy described in subsection (a) and the steps to \n     implement such strategy.\n\n     SEC. 7. ADVANCED MARKET COMMITMENTS.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to create \n     incentives for the private sector to invest in research, \n     development, and manufacturing of vaccines for neglected \n     diseases by creating a competitive market for future vaccines \n     through advanced market commitments.\n       (b) Authority to Negotiate.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall enter \n     into negotiations with the appropriate officials of the World \n     Bank, the International Development Association, and Global \n     Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations, the member nations \n     of such entities, and other interested parties for the \n     purpose of establishing advanced market commitments to \n     purchase vaccines and microbicides to combat neglected \n     diseases.\n       (2) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the \n     appropriate congressional committees a report on the status \n     of the negotiations to create advanced market commitments \n     under this section.\n       (c) Requirements.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall work \n     with the entities referred to in subsection (b) to ensure \n     that there is an international framework for the \n     establishment and implementation of advanced market \n     commitments and that such commitments include--\n       (1) legally binding contracts for product purchase that \n     include a fair market price for a guaranteed number of \n     treatments to ensure that the market incentive is sufficient;\n       (2) clearly defined and transparent rules of competition \n     for qualified developers and suppliers of the product;\n       (3) clearly defined requirements for eligible vaccines to \n     ensure that they are safe and effective;\n       (4) dispute settlement mechanisms; and\n       (5) sufficient flexibility to enable the contracts to be \n     adjusted in accord with new information related to projected \n     market size and other factors while still maintaining the \n     purchase commitment at a fair price.\n       (d) Trust Fund.--\n       (1) Authority to establish.--On the date that the Secretary \n     of the Treasury determines that a vaccine to combat a \n     neglected disease is available for purchase, the Secretary \n     shall establish in the Treasury of the United States a fund \n     to be known as the\n\n[[Page S10042]]\n\n     Lifesaving Vaccine Purchase Fund consisting of amounts \n     appropriated pursuant to paragraph (4).\n       (2) Investment of fund.--Amounts in such Fund shall be \n     invested in accordance with section 9702 of title 31, United \n     States Code, and any interest on, and proceeds from any such \n     investment shall be credited to and become part of the Fund.\n       (3) Use of fund.--The Secretary is authorized to expend \n     amounts in such Fund for the purchase of a vaccine to combat \n     a neglected disease pursuant to an advanced market commitment \n     undertaken on behalf of the Government of the United States.\n       (4) Authority to accept contributions.--The President may \n     accept and use in furtherance of the purposes of this Act \n     contributions from nongovernmental organizations, \n     international health agencies, the United Nations, the Global \n     Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, private \n     nonprofit organizations that are organized to support public \n     health research and programs, and any other organizations \n     willing to contribute to the Lifesaving Vaccine Purchase \n     Fund.\n       (5) Appropriations.--\n       (A) In general.--For each fiscal year beginning after the \n     date that the Secretary determines that a vaccine to combat a \n     neglected disease is available for purchase, there are \n     authorized to be appropriated out of any funds in the \n     Treasury not otherwise appropriated such sums as may be \n     necessary to carry out the purposes of such Fund.\n       (B) Transfer of funds.--The Secretary shall transfer the \n     amount appropriated under paragraph (1) for a fiscal year to \n     such Fund.\n       (C) Availability.--Amounts appropriated pursuant to this \n     paragraph shall remain available until expended without \n     fiscal year limitation.\n\n     SEC. 8.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce with Senator Kerry the \nVaccines for a New Millennium Act of 2005.\n  The AIDS crisis is devastating sub-Saharan Africa. According to the \nlatest figures from UNAIDS, there are approximately 40 million people \nliving with HIV/AIDS around the world. An estimated 4.9 million people \nwere newly infected last year. This means that every day, some 14,000 \npeople contract HIV/AIDS. Last year, an estimated 3 million people died \nfrom AIDS.\n  The AIDS crisis in sub-Saharan Africa has profound implications for \npolitical stability, development, and human welfare that extend far \nbeyond the region. In addition to the current crisis in Africa, public \nhealth experts warn of a ``second wave'' of countries on the verge of \npotential AIDS crises, such as China, India, Russia, Nigeria, and \nEthiopia.\n  Despite efforts through programs like the President's Emergency Plan \nfor AIDS Relief PEPFAR, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, \nand Malaria, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to treat those \nliving with HIV/AIDS and to prevent new infections, the disease is \noutpacing us. While prevention programs are critical in the struggle to \nslow the spread of the disease, over the long term, the most effective \nway to defeat this pandemic is through the development of an effective \nHIV vaccine.\n  In addition to AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis continue to kill many \nin the developing world. More than 300 million people are infected with \nmalaria annually, and an estimated 1 million people--mostly children \nunder the age of five--die from malaria. Combined, AIDS, tuberculosis, \nand malaria kill an estimated 5 million people a year. Yet\n\n[[Page S10044]]\n\nthere are no vaccines for these diseases. While we must remain \ncommitted to current prevention and treatment programs, we must also \nlook toward the future to see what hope science has for preventing the \nspread of these diseases.\n  Historically, vaccines have led to some of the greatest achievements \nin public health and are among the most cost-effective health \ninterventions. During the 20th century, global immunization efforts \nhave led to the eradication of smallpox and the elimination of polio \nfrom the Western Hemisphere, Europe and most of Asia. Vaccines for \ndiseases such as measles and tetanus have dramatically reduced \nchildhood mortality worldwide, and vaccines for diseases such as \ninfluenza, pneumonia, and hepatitis now help prevent sickness and death \nof adults, too.\n  Vaccines for these diseases would play an important role in saving \nlives in developing countries. Governments, private foundations, and \nthe private sector have made enormous strides. Public-private \npartnerships have also contributed to scientific advances in this area. \nHowever, much more needs to be done.\n  Because of the promise that vaccines hold, Senator Kerry and I are \nintroducing the ``Vaccines for the New Millennium Act of 2005.'' \nRepresentative Pete Visclosky is introducing a companion bill in the \nHouse of Representatives. Our bill would require the United States to \ndevelop a comprehensive strategy to accelerate research and development \nin vaccines for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and other infectious \ndiseases that are major killers in the developing world. The strategy \nwould require an increase in public-private partnerships, whereby \npublic entities such as governments, team up with companies or private \nfoundations to conduct research or vaccine trials. The bill would \nrequire the United States government to commit to purchase vaccines for \nthese diseases once they are developed through ``advance market \ncommitments.'' Finally, the legislation would create a tax credit for \ncompanies that invest in research and development for vaccines for \nthese diseases.\n  I am hopeful that Senators will join Senator Kerry and me in \nsupporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Hatch, Mr. DeWine, \n        Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Feingold, Mr. \n        Levin, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Reed, and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 1699. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to provide \ncriminal penalties for trafficking in counterfeit marks; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Senator Leahy, and \nmy colleagues Senators Hatch, DeWine, Cornyn, Brownback, Voinovich, \nFeingold, Levin, Bayh, Reed, and Stabenow, I seek recognition to \nintroduce the Stop Counterfeiting in Manufactured Goods Act, a bill \nthat amends title 18 of the United States Code to provide criminal \npenalties for trafficking in counterfeit marks.\n  This legislation closes a loophole in Federal trademark law, which \ncurrently criminalizes the trafficking in counterfeit trademarks ``on \nor in connection with goods or services.'' This language, however, does \nnot extend criminal liability to those persons who manufacture and/or \ntraffic the counterfeit marks themselves, marks which are later applied \nto a product or service. In other words, Federal law does not prohibit \na person Tom selling counterfeit labels bearing otherwise protected \ntrademarks within the United States.\n  This current loophole was created in large part by the Tenth \nCircuit's opinion in United States v. Giles, 213 F.3d 1247 (10th Cir. \n2000). In this case, the United States prosecuted the defendant for \nmanufacturing and selling counterfeit Dooney & Bourke labels that third \nparties could later affix to generic purses. Examining Title 18, \nsection 2320, of the United States Code, the Tenth Circuit held that \npersons who sell counterfeit trademarks that are not actually attached \nto any ``goods or services'' do not violate the Federal criminal \ntrademark infringement statute. And because the defendant did not \nattach the counterfeit mark to a ``good or service,'' the court found \nthat the defendant did not run afoul of the criminal statute as a \nmatter of law. Thus, an individual, caught red-handed with counterfeit \ntrademarks, walked free. Congress must act now to close this loophole, \nwhich this legislation being introduced today will most certainly do. \nSpecifically, the bill will prohibit the trafficking, or attempt to \ntraffic, in ``labels, patches, stickers'' and generally any item to \nwhich a counterfeit mark has been applied.\n  In addition to closing the loophole, the Stop Counterfeiting in \nManufactured Goods Act strengthens the criminal code's forfeiture \nprovision by providing enhanced penalties for those trafficking in \ncounterfeit marks, goods and services bearing counterfeit marks. \nCurrent law does not provide for the seizure and forfeiture of goods \nand services bearing counterfeit marks. As such, many times such \ncounterfeit goods are seized one day, only to be returned and sold to \nan unsuspecting public. To ensure that individuals engaging in the \npractice of trafficking in counterfeit marks cannot reopen their doors, \nthis bill provides procedures for the mandatory seizure, forfeiture, \nand destruction of counterfeit marks pre-conviction. Further, it \nprovides for procedures for the mandatory forfeiture and destruction of \nproperty derived from or used to engage in the trafficking of \ncounterfeit marks.\n  The trade in counterfeit marks is only part of a much larger problem. \nThe Bureau of Customs and Border Protection estimates that trafficking \nin counterfeit goods costs the United States approximately $200 million \nannually. With each passing year, the United States loses millions of \ndollars in tax revenues to the sale of counterfeit goods. Further, \ncounterfeit items manufactured overseas and distributed in the United \nStates cost American workers tens of thousands of jobs. This is a \nproblem that we can no longer ignore.\n  The trafficking in counterfeit goods and marks is not limited to \nthose of the popular designer goods that we have all seen sold on \ncorners of just about every major metropolitan city in the United \nStates. Counterfeited products can range from children's toys to \nclothing to Christmas tree lights. More disturbing are the potentially \nhazardous counterfeit automobile parts, batteries, and electrical \nequipment that are being manufactured and placed into the stream of \ncommerce by the thousands with each passing day.\n  This legislation closes a loophole in the current criminal trademark \ninfringement statute and ensures that it is a crime not only to traffic \nin goods or services bearing counterfeit marks, but also in the \ncounterfeit marks themselves. Further, this legislation ensures that \ncounterfeit goods and marks seized in violation of this statute are \nproperly disposed of and do not make their way back onto the street. I \nam pleased to introduce this piece of legislation with my colleagues \nand hope that it will receive the support that it is due.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Counterfeiting is a threat to America. It wreaks real harm \non our economy, our workers, and our consumers. Today, Senator Specter \nand I introduce the ``Stop Counterfeiting in Manufactured Goods Act,'' \na tough bill that will give law enforcement improved tools to fight \nthis form of theft. The bill is short and straightforward, but its \nimpact should be profound and far-reaching.\n  It is all too easy to think of counterfeiting as a victimless crime, \na means of buying sunglasses or a purse that would otherwise strain a \nmonthly budget. The reality, however, is far different. According to \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation, counterfeiting costs the U.S. \nbetween $200 billion and $250 billion annually. In Vermont, companies \nlike Burton Snowboards, Vermont Tubbs, SB Electronics, and Hubbardton \nForge--all of which have cultivated their good names through pure hard \nwork and creativity--have felt keenly the damage of intellectual \nproperty theft on their businesses. This is wrong. It is simply not \nfair to the businesses who innovate and to the people whose economic \nlivelihoods depend on these companies.\n  The threat posed by counterfeiting is more than a matter of \neconomics. Inferior products can threaten the safety of those who use \nthem. When a driver taps a car's brake pedals there should be no \nuncertainty about whether the\n\n[[Page S10045]]\n\nbrake linings are made of compressed grass, sawdust, or cardboard. Sick \npatients should not have to worry that they will ingest counterfeit \nprescription drugs and, at best, have no effect. The World Health \nOrganization estimates that the market for counterfeit drugs is about \n$32 billion each year. Knock-off parts have even been found in NATO \nhelicopters. What's more, according to Interpol, there is an \nidentifiable link between counterfeit goods and the financing of \nterrorist operations.\n  This is a global problem, and it demands global solutions. Earlier \nthis year at a Judiciary Committee hearing on international piracy, the \nGeneral Counsel for the United States Trade Representative reported \nthat China continues to see piracy rates of about ninety percent in \nnearly all industries. Russia is a growing concern too, even as that \ncountry seeks membership in the World Trade Organization. Both \ncountries were added to USTR's Priority Watch List this year. Such \nlists are useful, but they are meaningless without concrete steps by \nthe countries singled out by USTR. We know that counterfeiting can be \nfought when a country treats it as a priority. China, for example, \nflexed its intellectual property enforcement muscle recently in \nprotecting logos related to Beijing's 2008 Summer Olympic Games. In a \nNewsweek International article last January, one vendor who was fined \nfor selling Olympic t-shirts noted that the crackdown was concerted: `` \n`They are,' she says, `very serious.' ''\n  I am very serious as well. Even as we work toward better \ninternational enforcement, there is much we can do, and much that we \nhave done, to improve domestic law. In 1996, I worked with Senator \nHatch to pass the Anticounterfeiting Consumer Protection Act, which \nstrengthened our criminal and tariff codes and applied federal \nracketeering laws to counterfeiting. And earlier this year, Senator \nCornyn and I introduced S. 1095, the Protecting American Goods and \nServices Act. That bill would criminalize possession of counterfeit \ngoods with intent to traffic, expand the definition of ``traffic,'' and \ncriminalize the importing and exporting of counterfeit goods.\n  The bill that Senator Specter and I are introducing today also makes \nseveral improvements to the U.S. Code. The bill strengthens 18 U.S.C. \n2318, the part of the criminal code that deals with counterfeit goods \nand services, to make it a crime to traffic in counterfeit labels or \npackaging, even when counterfeit labels or packaging are shipped \nseparately from the goods to which they will ultimately be attached. \nSavvy counterfeiters have exploited this loophole to escape liability. \nThis bill closes that loophole.\n  The bill will also make counterfeit labels and goods, and any \nequipment used in facilitating a crime under this part of the code, \nsubject to forfeiture upon conviction. Any forfeited goods or machinery \nwould then be destroyed, and the convicted infringer would have to pay \nrestitution to the lawful owner of the trademark. Finally, although the \nbill is tough, it is also fair. It states that nothing ``shall entitle \nthe United States to bring a cause of action under this section for the \nrepackaging of genuine goods or services not intended to deceive or \nconfuse.'' It is truly just the bad actors we want to punish.\n  Those who profit from another's innovation have proved their \ncreativity only at escaping responsibility for their actions. As \nlegislators it is important that we provide law enforcement with the \ntools needed to capture these thieves. It is a task to which Senator \nSpecter and I are both committed. I would like to thank Senator Bayh, \nSenator Brownback, Senator Cornyn, Senator DeWine, Senator Feingold, \nSenator Hatch, Senator Levin, Senator Reed, and Senator Stabenow for \ncosponsoring this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 1703. A bill to provide for the development and implementation of \nan emergency backup communications system; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Communications \nSecurity Act of 2005. The events of 9/11 uncovered manifest structural \nweaknesses in our communications system, which were then highlighted by \nthe 9/11 Commission. At the time, public safety and emergency response \nofficials were not able to communicate at a basic level. We have not \ntaken adequate steps to fix that dangerous problem, and Hurricane \nKatrina has bluntly demonstrated that. Much of the communications \nsystem was knocked off-line along the Gulf Coast. It was remarkable to \nwatch as the television news crews had better luck communicating than \nour first responders. As the disaster unfolded, our first responders \nand emergency officials repeatedly cited communications failures as a \nmajor obstacle to the disaster response effort.\n  We need a redundant communications system that will work in times of \nemergency. Dramatic advances in technology and the availability of new \nspectrum as part of the DTV transition offer opportunities to address \nthis problem. The Communications Security Act of 2005 requires the \ntechnical experts at the Department of Homeland Security and the \nFederal Communications Commission evaluate the feasibility and cost of \ndeploying a back-up emergency communications system. The agencies will \nevaluate all reasonable options, including satellites, wireless and \nterrestrial-based systems. They will evaluate all available public and \nprivate resources that could provide such a system and submit a report \nto Congress detailing the findings. The DHS is then authorized to \nrequest appropriations to implement the system. Congress would then be \nin position to put in place whatever programs and funding are needed to \nget the job done.\n  This proposal will not resolve all of our long-term needs in \npreparedness and interoperability, and I am pleased that many of my \ncolleagues are working on the various pieces of this puzzle. However, \nin the interim, we must ensure that we can respond in emergency \nsituations with an eye toward building a reliable, redundant system for \nthe long term.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1703\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Communications Security Act \n     of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The tragic events of September 11, 2001, placed an \n     enormous strain on the communications network in New York \n     City, New York and Washington, District of Columbia. \n     Officials from both cities struggled to communicate and \n     coordinate among the various emergency response teams \n     dispatched to ``Ground Zero'' and the Pentagon. These events \n     uncovered manifest structural weaknesses in the \n     communications infrastructure of the United States.\n       (2) The 9/11 Commission Report states that our Nation \n     remains largely unprepared to communicate effectively in the \n     event of another attack or natural catastrophe.\n       (3) The massive communications failures associated with \n     Hurricane Katrina illustrate the continuing inadequacies of \n     our communications systems in times of crisis.\n       (4) Despite heroic efforts by public officials and \n     communications industry personnel, the failure of our \n     communications network to persevere in the face of a \n     catastrophic hurricane severely hampered post-storm recovery \n     efforts.\n       (5) A comprehensive effort must be undertaken to deal with \n     the communications challenges faced by our Nation, including \n     short-term and long-term steps that can be taken to improve \n     the interoperable communications and emergency response \n     capability within the United States.\n       (6) There is an immediate need for the development and \n     deployment of an emergency back-up communications system to \n     enhance the Nation's emergency response capabilities. \n     Deployment of an emergency back-up communications system \n     should be a priority of the United States.\n       (7) The deployment of such a system is a critical first \n     step in enhancing the overall communications infrastructure. \n     Other required improvements will need to be made in such \n     areas as training, personnel, equipment, software, and \n     services for local governments, and assistance with capital \n     expenses. Supporting and enhancing ongoing efforts in this \n     regard is an important goal.\n\n     SEC. 3. EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS BACK-UP SYSTEM.\n\n       Title III of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. \n     181 et seq.), as amended by section 4, is further amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n\n[[Page S10046]]\n\n     ``SEC. 317. EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS BACK-UP SYSTEM.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date \n     of enactment of the Communications Security Act of 2005, the \n     Secretary, in conjunction with the Federal Communications \n     Commission, shall evaluate the technical feasibility of \n     creating a back-up emergency communications system that \n     complements existing communications resources and takes into \n     account next generation and advanced telecommunications \n     technologies. The overriding objective for the evaluation \n     shall be providing a framework for the development of a \n     resilient interoperable communications system for emergency \n     responders in an emergency. In conducting that evaluation, \n     the Secretary shall evaluate all reasonable options, \n     including satellites, wireless, and terrestrial-based \n     communications systems and other alternative transport \n     mechanisms that can be used in tandem with existing \n     technologies.\n       ``(b) Components.--The back-up system shall include--\n       ``(1) reliable means of emergency communications; and\n       ``(2) if necessary, handsets, desktop communications \n     devices, or other appropriate devices for each public safety \n     entity.\n       ``(c) Factors to Be Evaluated.--The evaluation under \n     subsection (a) shall include--\n       ``(1) a survey of all Federal agencies that use terrestrial \n     or satellite technology for communications security and an \n     evaluation of the feasibility of using existing systems for \n     purposes creating such an emergency back-up medical facility \n     public safety communications system;\n       ``(2) the feasibility of using private satellite, wireless, \n     or terrestrial networks for emergency communications;\n       ``(3) the technical options, cost, and deployment methods \n     of software, equipment,handsets or desktop communications \n     devices for public safety entities in major urban areas, and \n     nationwide; and\n       ``(4) the feasibility and cost of necessary changes to the \n     network operations center of terrestrial-based or satellite \n     systems to enable the centers to serve as an emergency back-\n     up communications systems.\n       ``(d) Report.--Upon the completion of the evaluation under \n     subsection (a), the Secretary shall submit a report to \n     Congress that details the findings of the evaluation, \n     including a full inventory of existing public and private \n     resources most efficiently capable of providing emergency \n     communications.\n       ``(e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are \n     authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary \n     to carry out this section.\n       ``(f) Expedited Funding Option and Implementation \n     Strategy.--If, as a result of the evaluation conducted under \n     subsection (a), the Secretary determines that the \n     establishment of such a back-up system is feasible then the \n     Secretary shall request appropriations for the deployment of \n     such a back-up communications system not later than 90 days \n     after submission of the report under subsection (d).''.\n       (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents for the \n     Homeland Security Act of 2002, as amended by section 4, is \n     amended by inserting after the item relating to section 316 \n     the following:\n\n``Sec. 317. Emergency communications back-up system.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN:\n  S. 1704. A bill to prohibit the use of Federal funds for the taking \nof property by eminent domain for economic development; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Earlier this year, the Supreme Court ruled in Kelo vs. \nNew London that it was permissible for a government to use the power of \neminent domain simply for the purpose of economic development.\n  I am greatly troubled by this case. I do not believe that the \ngovernment can or should take property for a non-governmental purpose \nsimply because it will generate additional tax revenue.\n  This court decision stands logic on its head--and it is a dangerous \nprecedent as well.\n  I understand that there will be times when it is essential for the \ngovernment to use eminent domain for the public good. For example, \neminent domain is appropriate in order to build a flood control project \nto protect a city. Or to construct a highway or lay a water line.\n  But it makes no sense for the Court to allow a city--or a state or \neven the federal government--to use its power to allow private \ndevelopers to acquire property under the takings clause. Once you start \ndown that path, whose private property is safe? Could my home be \ncondemned because a larger, more expensive house could be built on that \nlot? Can a local cafe be seized in order to provide space for a new, \nhigh-end French restaurant?\n  Government at all levels should be protecting and strengthening \nprivate property rights--not diminishing them.\n  So today I am introducing legislation to clarify and strengthen \nprivate property rights and ensure that government cannot abuse its \npower of eminent domain in the name of ``economic development.''\n  First, my bill prevents the use of Federal funds for any economic \ndevelopment project that uses property that was subject of an eminent \ndomain taking. This would cut off the spigot of Federal dollars to \nthese questionable projects. Frankly, most economic development \nprojects rely in some way on Federal dollars so this provision would \nhave the practical effect of sharply curtailing this practice.\n  Second, my bill is explicit that traditional public use and public \npurpose projects are still permitted. I am not trying to end the use of \neminent domain in order to protect public health and safety or in order \nto build important infrastructure in our communities. My bill makes \nthis clear.\n  Finally, this bill clearly lays out that the funding prohibition \nincludes takings of private property for the use of, or ownership of, \nanother private individual or entity. One of the most troubling trends \nin this area is the use of eminent domain by a government that then \nturns the property over to a private person or group for their private \ngain.\n  This issue also demands attention at the state level. I commend the \nefforts of a number of leaders in North Dakota to make changes to our \nstate constitution in a way that will protect private property owners.\n  Our former state attorney general, Heidi Heitkamp, is spearheading an \neffort to prevent the use of eminent domain at the State level for \neconomic development purposes regardless of whether Federal funds are \nused. This is an important initiative and I fully support it. It is an \nimportant complement to the bill I am introducing today. In fact, much \nof the language in my bill reflects the language in the initiated \nmeasure in North Dakota.\n  Strong private property rights are a fundamental part of our \ncountry's heritage and I believe that we should take steps to protect \nthose rights. This bill will afford all Americans better protection \nagainst inappropriate uses of eminent domain and seizure of property.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows.\n\n                                S. 1704\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS IN ECONOMIC \n                   DEVELOPMENT RELATING TO PROPERTY TAKEN BY \n                   EMINENT DOMAIN.\n\n         (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Private \n     Property Protection Act of 2005''.\n         (b) Prohibition.--\n         (1) In general.--No Federal funds may be used relating to \n     a property that is the subject of a taking by eminent domain.\n         (2) Exception.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply if the \n     property is being used for public use or a public purpose.\n         (c) Public Use or Public Purpose .--Economic development, \n     including an increase in the tax base, tax revenues, or \n     employment, may not be the primary basis for establishing a \n     public use or public purpose under subsection (b).\n         (d) Takings for Use by Private Individual or Entity.--\n     Subsection (b) shall include to takings of private property \n     for the use of, or ownership by, any private individual or \n     entity.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S.J. Res. 24. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States relative to the reference to God in \nthe Pledge of Allegiance and on United States currency; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, a Federal District Court judge in the \nNinth Circuit has once again declared that the reference to God in the \nPledge of Allegiance is unconstitutional. Just a couple of years ago, \nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reached a similar conclusion in the \ncase of Newdow v. U.S. Congress. I am now, as I was then, surprised and \ndisappointed with this new ruling by the District Court.\n  Today I am reintroducing a proposed constitutional amendment that \nsimply says that references to God in the Pledge of Allegiance and on \nour currency do not affect an establishment of religion under the First \nAmendment. References to God are found in every\n\n[[Page S10047]]\n\none of our founding documents from the Declaration of Independence to \nthe Constitution, as well as in the Pledge of Allegiance. The phrase \n``In God We Trust'' appears on all of our currency and on many public \nbuildings. Every day, we begin Senate sessions with a prayer and the \nPledge. I firmly believe that the framers of the Constitution and the \nFirst Amendment did not want to ban all references to God from public \ndiscourse when they wrote the Establishment Clause. What they wanted to \nprevent was the establishment of an official national religion and to \nkeep the government from getting intimately involved in the \norganization of one religion over another.\n  These references to God are ceremonial. Certainly, they do have \nmeaning, but individuals are free to put whatever meaning on the word \nthey choose. Indeed, I fully respect and support the rights of people \nnot to participate in the Pledge or in ceremonial prayer and my \namendment will not coerce anyone to recite the Pledge of Allegiance in \npublic or in school.\n  I had hoped that the Supreme Court, which took the Newdow case up on \nappeal, would have settled this question once and for all. It did not. \nThe Court dismissed the case saying Mr. Newdow lacked standing. The \nSupreme Court may have the opportunity to hear arguments in this case \nlater on. If the Supreme Court should decide not to hear the case or to \noverrule the lower court, then Congress should restore the appropriate \nbalance between church and state that I believe was the intent of the \nframers.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this joint resolution and I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the resolution be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows.\n\n                              S.J. Res. 24\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of \n     each House concurring therein), That the following article is \n     proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as \n     part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of \n     three-fourths of the several States within 7 years after the \n     date of its submission by the Congress:\n\n                              ``Article --\n\n       ``Section 1.

Res. 237\n\n       Whereas, on June 10, 1999, the United Nations Security \n     Council adopted Resolution 1244 which authorized the \n     Secretary-General of the United Nations to establish an \n     interim administration for Kosovo to assume the supreme legal \n     authority in Kosovo with the task of promoting ``substantial \n     autonomy and self-governance'' in Kosovo and facilitating a \n     political process to determine the future status of Kosovo;\n       Whereas, on December 10, 2003, the United Nations interim \n     administration, known as the United Nations Interim \n     Administration Mission in Kosovo, presented the Standards for \n     Kosovo document which set out the requirements to be met to \n     advance stability in Kosovo;\n       Whereas the Standards for Kosovo require the establishment \n     of functioning democratic institutions in Kosovo, including \n     providing for the holding of elections, establishing the \n     Provisional Institutions of Self-Government, and establishing \n     media and civil society, the establishment of rule of law to \n     ensure equal access to justice and to implement mechanisms to \n     suppress economic and financial crime, and the establishment \n     of freedom of movement in Kosovo, including the free use of \n     language;\n       Whereas the Standards for Kosovo further require \n     sustainable returns and the rights of communities and their \n     members, improvements in economic and financial institutions, \n     including the prevention of money laundering and the \n     establishment of an attractive environment for investors, the \n     establishment of property rights, including the preservation \n     of cultural heritage, and the development of a sustained \n     dialogue, including a Pristina-Belgrade dialogue and a \n     regional dialogue;\n       Whereas the ethnic violence that occurred in Kosovo from \n     March 17, 2004 through March 19, 2004, represented a severe \n     setback to the progress the people of Kosovo achieved in \n     implementing the Standards for Kosovo and resulted in 20 \n     deaths and damage to or destruction of approximately 900 \n     homes and 30 Serbian Orthodox churches and other religious \n     sites;\n       Whereas the bomb attacks against the people and \n     international institutions in Kosovo that occurred from July \n     2, 2005 through July 4, 2005, were unacceptable events that \n     work counter to the interests and efforts of the majority of \n     the people of Kosovo and signal that more work must be done \n     to promote the implementation of the Standards for Kosovo;\n       Whereas the status of Kosovo, which is neither stable nor \n     sustainable, is a critical issue affecting the aspirations of \n     Southeast Europe for stability, peace, and eventual \n     membership in the European Union;\n       Whereas the authorities and institutions of Kosovo must be \n     empowered to act independently to achieve the Standards for \n     Kosovo so that such authorities and institutions may assume \n     responsibility for any progress or setbacks;\n       Whereas 2005 must be a year of decision for representatives \n     of Kosovo, Serbia and Montenegro, and the United Nations to \n     move forward on the status of Kosovo;\n       Whereas the basic values of multi-ethnicity, democracy, and \n     market-orientation must remain at the heart of any effort to \n     resolve the question of the future status of Kosovo; and\n       Whereas the support of all of the people of Kosovo is \n     required to achieve a successful outcome that addresses those \n     basic values: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the unresolved status of Kosovo is neither sustainable \n     nor beneficial to the progress toward stability and peace in \n     Southeast Europe and its integration with Europe;\n       (2) the leaders of Kosovo and Serbia and Montenegro and the \n     representatives of the United Nations should work toward an \n     agreement on the future status of Kosovo and a plan for \n     transformation in Kosovo;\n       (3) such agreement and plan should--\n       (A) address the claims and satisfy the key concerns of the \n     people of Kosovo and the people of Serbia and Montenegro;\n       (B) seek compromises from both Kosovo and Serbia and \n     Montenegro to reach an agreement;\n       (C) promote the integration of Southeast Europe with the \n     European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization;\n       (D) reinforce efforts to encourage full cooperation by the \n     governments of Kosovo and of Serbia and Montenegro with the \n     International Crimes Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia;\n       (E) promote stability in the region and take into \n     consideration the stability of democracy in Kosovo and in \n     Serbia and Montenegro;\n       (F) promote the active participation of Serbians in Kosovo \n     in elections and in the government of Kosovo; and\n       (G) require the fulfillment of the Standards for Kosovo, \n     the requirements that the United Nations Interim \n     Administration Mission in Kosovo established to advance \n     stability in Kosovo, in accordance with prior commitments and \n     in support of the initiation of discussions on status with \n     particular emphasis on the problem of human rights in \n     minority communities;\n       (4) the anticipated discussions of the long-term status of \n     Kosovo should result in a plan for implementing the Standards \n     for Kosovo, particularly with regard to minority protections, \n     return of property, and the development of rule of law as it \n     relates to the improvement of protection of minorities, the \n     return of internally displaced persons, the return of \n     property, and the prosecution of human rights violations; and\n       (5) Kosovo, Serbia and Montenegro, and the United Nations, \n     during the negotiations related to the long-term status of \n     Kosovo, should require--\n       (A) increased monitoring and reporting of the progress on \n     the implementation of the Standards for Kosovo and any \n     incidents of human rights violations, and should broaden the \n     involvement of minorities and community-level representatives \n     in monitoring, reporting, and publicizing that progress;\n       (B) that the authorities and institutions of Kosovo be \n     given greater authority and independence in fulfilling the \n     Standards for Kosovo, including assuming the responsibility \n     for any setbacks and progress and acquiring experience in \n     assuming greater autonomy; and\n       (C) a broad public awareness campaign to raise awareness of \n     both the plan to resolve the question of the status of Kosovo \n     and the requirements for the transition of Kosovo to a \n     permanent status, including the importance of the progress in \n     implementing the\n\n[[Page S10048]]\n\n     Standards for Kosovo and the necessity of ensuring peace and \n     suppressing all forms of discrimination and violence so that \n     the region may move forward toward a future of greater \n     prosperity, stability, and lasting peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/14/senate-section/article/S10048-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 238--RECOGNIZING HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH AND \n    CELEBRATING THE VAST CONTRIBUTIONS OF HISPANIC AMERICANS TO THE \n                   STRENGTH AND CULTURE OF OUR NATION\n\n  Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Alexander, Mr. \nAllen, Mr. Burr, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Crapo, \nMr. Grassley, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. McCain, Mr. Nelson of Florida, \nMr. Obama, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Talent, and Mr. \nVoinovich) submitted the following resolution;
