The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                                schedule\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in a moment we will return to consideration \nof the pending Energy legislation that we debated last week and this \nweek and will complete later this week. We will resume debate on the \namendment of Senator Martinez relating to the inventory of the OSC. The \ntime agreement we reached last night provides for up to 80 minutes of \ndebate before the vote on that amendment, although I do not believe all \nof that time will be necessary. We would like to begin that vote no \nlater than 11 this morning. We request that Senators come promptly for \nthat vote.\n  We will be recessing at 11:30 to accommodate the weekly policy \nluncheons today. At 2:15, when the Senate returns from recess, we will \ncontinue through the amendments to the Energy bill. I believe the \nclimate change amendments will be ready later this morning and for \ndebate beginning at 2:15. We would expect votes on those amendments \nduring today's session.\n  I reiterate that it is my intention to file cloture on this bill \nlater this evening. That would allow us to continue to consider and \ndispose of amendments, but it would also assure that we have a glide \npath to completion of the bill and that we would complete passage of \nthe bill this week. The managers have done tremendous work over the \nlast almost week and a half in moving the process along. I hope we can \ncontinue in that respect and finish the bill no later than Thursday or \nFriday of this week. Thus, we will be having a vote late this morning, \nand we will in all likelihood be voting on the climate change \namendments later this afternoon. In addition, there will be the \nopportunity for people to come to the Senate floor and offer their \namendments.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 783\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there will be 80 \nminutes of debate on amendment No. 783.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be equally divided between both sides.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation now? \nAre we having speeches on the amendment to strike the OCS inventory by \nSenators Martinez and Nelson and Corzine; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator would have 8 minutes left.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask to be notified when I have spoken \nfor 5\n\n[[Page S6872]]\n\nminutes. I know Senator Corzine is coming to speak. If you could let me \nknow when my 5 minutes is up, I would appreciate it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Chair will notify the \nSenator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am proud to sponsor the Martinez-Nelson-\nCorzine-Boxer amendment to strike the OCS inventory language from the \nEnergy bill. For millions of Americans living near our coasts, this \namendment is arguably the most important we will debate on this bill. \nWe know huge numbers of people live within 50 miles of America's \ncoastlines. Few things are synonymous with California more than the \nbeautiful beaches and the coasts. We have some pictures to show what \nthis means to our children.\n  This is a scene I remember with my own children and now with my own \ngrandson when he comes to visit California. This is what we think \nabout. The natural beauty that is the California coast helps form our \nState's identity, as these pictures show. I will show you another one \nat this time as well. When I look at this, I just think: California.\n  The coast is a huge reason so many millions of Americans have chosen \nCalifornia as their home. Indeed, out of our 36 million Californians, \n21 million Californians live in coastal counties. That is roughly 64 \npercent of the State's population. And there is a reason for it. This \nis God's gift to our State and to the people of this country and, \nfrankly, to the people of the world who come to spend time on \nCalifornia's coastline and beaches.\n  The California coast is home to dozens of threatened and endangered \nspecies, including the short-tailed albatross, California Gnatcatcher, \nsea otters, chinook and coho salmon, steelhead trout, guadalupe fur \nseal, and several species of whales. Our coast is a true national \ntreasure.\n  But Californians are not the only people who treasure our coastline. \nWe know that tourists, millions of them, come to our State, generating \n$51 billion in annual revenues for our State. The protection of \nCalifornia's coasts, frankly, as much as all the other coasts we will \nprotect, is not just an environmental necessity, it is an economic \nnecessity.\n  The underlying bill could very well lead to more offshore oil \ndrilling, could devastate my State and its way of life, and I trust \nthat this bipartisan legislation being offered by Senators Martinez and \nNelson will be agreed to because the inventory that is agreed to in \nthis bill could encourage further drilling in the not-so-distant \nfuture, putting all of our coasts at risk.\n  Make no mistake about it. This inventory is not a benign compiling of \na grocery list of resources. The inventory proponents would have us \nbelieve that, but it is really not benign. The inventory will be \nconducted using seismic air guns which use explosive blasts to map rock \nformations beneath the sea. Sound from these blasts can be detected for \nthousands of miles, and hundreds of millions of blasts would be \nrequired to survey America's Outer Continental Shelf. These seismic \nblasts have been shown to have major consequences for marine life. So I \ndo not see how it makes sense to say, on the one hand, we are \nprotecting our beautiful coastline with moratoria and then allow the \ninventory to go forward in these areas.\n  Most fish use hearing to detect predators, find prey, communicate, \nand find mates. Loss of hearing can have profound, even fatal effects \non our fish.\n  So why would we take God's precious gift and subject it to this kind \nof trauma? Frankly, it is wrong. To me, it is almost a moral issue, \nthat we protect the beauty we have been given, this God-given beauty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for another minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Seismic air guns have been shown to result in severely \ndiminished fish catches by so severely startling the fish, they quickly \nleave the area or descend to the sea floor, seeking shelter from the \nnoise. One study showed that when seismic blasts had been conducted in \n1996, catch rates of cod and haddock declined between 45 percent and 70 \npercent over a 1,400-square-mile area, and 5 days later the catch rate \nhad still not recovered.\n  I ask for an additional minute on top of my minute to finish.\n  The fact is, with so many fishery stocks already depleted, should we \nreally do anything else to harm them, and can our fishermen afford the \nrisk?\n  Marine mammals such as whales also use sound to locate food, avoid \npredators, care for young, and navigate the oceans. Seismic blasts can \ninterfere with all of these critical activities. Air gun blasts have \nbeen observed to affect the feeding behavior of sperm whales in the \nGulf of Mexico, migrating bowhead whales in the Beaufort Sea off the \nAlaskan coast, and harbor porpoises, which appear to be dodging and \nevading the sounds dozens of miles away from the blasts. Indeed, last \nyear, the International Whaling Commission's Scientific Committee \nconcluded that the increased sound from seismic surveys was cause for \nserious concern.\n  Mr. President, I see the Senator from New Jersey is here. We are \nrunning out of time, so I am going to wrap this up and cede the rest of \nthe time to the Senator from New Jersey. I hope everyone supports this \nbipartisan amendment before us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n1 minute 5 seconds.\n  Mr. CORZINE. One minute and 5 seconds? That is the time allotted by \nthe Chair? Let me, then, be brief.\n  I rise today as a cosponsor in support of the amendment offered by \nSenators martinez and Nelson that will keep the door closed to offshore \ndrilling. The amendment strikes language in the bill that would allow a \nseismic inventory of all potential oil and natural gas resources in the \nOuter Continental Shelf, including areas off of the New Jersey coast.\n  The people of New Jersey strongly oppose allowing such an inventory \nand I voted against this provision during the committee markup.\n  New Jersey recognizes that taking inventory of these resources is a \nstep onto a slippery slope toward the eventual drilling off the New \nJersey coast; resources that are currently protected by the Outer \nContinental Shelf, or OCS, moratoria. After all, why would anyone \nconduct an inventory unless they have the intention to drill if \nresources are found? ``Inventory'' is just bureaucratic-speak for an \nopen door to drilling off of our coast.\n  I have long fought to maintain the bipartisan, two-decades-old \nmoratorium on drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf. Any drilling, or \neven the threat of drilling, poses a real threat to the New Jersey \nenvironment, economy, and way of life. Drilling would leave the New \nJersey coast and its waters vulnerable to oil spills, drilling \ndischarges and damage to coastal wetlands.\n  The environmental effects of an ecological disaster know no State \nboundaries. Oil spills are not fleeting environmental sound bites. \nThese accidents linger for years, causing sustained environmental harm.\n  In addition, coastal tourism is our second largest industry. It \ngenerates more than $31 billion in spending, directly and indirectly \nand supports more than 836,000 jobs; more than 20 percent of total \nState employment. Coastal tourism in New Jersey generates more than \n$16.6 billion in wages and brings in more than $5.5 billion in tax \nrevenues to the State.\n  New Jersey already holds its own in supporting energy production and \nrefining. We have three nuclear power plants. We are the East Coast hub \nfor oil refining.\n  We are growing our energy business, but exploiting our shore is a \nstep we refuse to take.\n  This is not just an issue for my State. Protecting the moratoria on \ndrilling is important to maintaining the integrity of the coastline of \nthe United States. Allowing drilling in anyone area affects all the \nsurrounding areas. Tides move across State borders. Fisheries and fish \ndo not recognize State borders. This issue affects us all, and we must \nprotect the integrity of the moratoria at all costs.\n  The inventory is not only dangerous because it starts us on the \nslippery slope towards drilling, but also because the methods used to \nconduct the inventory, including seismic surveys, can disrupt marine \necosystems and damage our local fisheries.\n  Dr. Chris Clark, Director of the Bioacoustics Research Program at \nCornell\n\n[[Page S6873]]\n\nUniversity, has called seismic testing ``the most severe acoustic \ninsult to the marine environment . . . short of naval warfare.'' The \nimpulses from the explosive shock waves used have been shown to cause \nharm to many species of marine life and have been equated with \nexploratory dynamite. It is not only dangerous but also costly. The \ninventory is estimated to cost U.S. taxpayers $1 billion.\n  There is no need to conduct an invasive, environmentally harmful \ninventory when the Minerals Management Service already provides an \nestimate of oil and natural gas reserves in the Outer Continental \nShelf.\n  The MMS estimate is noninvasive and does not harm the environment. So \nI say to my colleagues, we have no need for a seismic inventory--we \nalready know about the resources off our shores.\n  According to the most recent study, the resources are few and far \nbetween. In fact, the MMS estimated that the Atlantic contains only \neight percent of the Nation's undiscovered natural gas. In addition, in \n2000, the MMS estimated the entire Mid-Atlantic region only contains \n196 million barrels of oil, enough to last the country barely 10 days.\n  Why would any east coast State want to risk their coastal economies \nfor another inventory when we already know what's out there? Ten days \nworth of oil will do nothing to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil.\n  This administration already has a reputation for threatening the \nmoratoria. On May 31, 2001, the Minerals Management Service released a \nrequest for proposals to conduct a study of the environmental impacts \nof drilling in the Atlantic. The stated purpose of the study was to \nexamine ``areas with some reservoir potential, for example off the \ncoast of New Jersey, and in the area formerly known as the Manteo Unit \noff North Carolina . . . in anticipation of managing the exploitation \nof potential and proven reserves.''\n  Allow me to repeat that last part. The study was ``in anticipation of \nmanaging the exploitation of potential and proven reserves.''\n  Needless to say, the request created quite an uproar in my State. One \nlocal headline read, ``Specter of drilling offshore is back, angering \nJersey.'' New Jerseyans were outraged, as were the members of the New \nJersey delegation here in Washington. My colleagues and I urged the \nadministration to rescind the request, and were successful. But the \nthreat still lingers, and this inventory will be the beginning of the \nunraveling of the moratoria and the eventual drilling off the New \nJersey shores.\n  Past congresses and Presidents have ruled out Atlantic drilling for \nyears, and we are not going to allow it now. American taxpayers should \nnot have to pay for studies that amount to nothing more than oil \nindustry fantasies.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment so that we can \nprotect our Nation's precious coastlines and ocean waters.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from North \nCarolina?\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I am happy to yield to the Senator from North Carolina \n4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized \nfor 4 minutes.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, since 1993 a moratorium has been in place \non oil and gas exploration off the coast of North Carolina, thus \nprotecting vital coastal areas from drilling. This moratorium has \nprovided a much needed boost to our coastal economy and my entire \nState.\n  Each year, thousands of families flock to North Carolina beaches to \nenjoy the sun, dip in the cool waters, and spend time with family and \nfriends. Visitors provide much needed tourism dollars that create and \nsustain jobs. This moratorium has worked.\n  Only 2 years ago, I helped lead the successful effort to stop an \nattempt to lift the moratorium on oil and gas exploration off the coast \nof North Carolina and many other States. Yet here we are, once again, \nconfronting the same proposal to undermine the moratorium and open new \nareas of the Outer Continental Shelf to oil and gas development.\n  I am proud to join a bipartisan group of my colleagues in offering an \namendment to strike a provision in the Energy bill that exposes \ncurrently restricted environmentally sensitive coastal areas to oil and \ngas exploration. I especially thank my friend and colleague, Senator \nMel Martinez, for his true leadership on this issue in his first year \nin the Senate.\n  There is no question that now more than ever we must work to end our \ndependence on foreign oil. But we cannot do so by ignoring the wishes \nand economic needs of the majority of the people of North Carolina and \nmany other coastal States that oppose this exploration. Exploring off \nour coast would endanger North Carolina's booming tourism industry, a \ntrue economic engine of my State. According to the North Carolina \nDepartment of Commerce, tourism is one of North Carolina's largest \nindustries, supporting nearly 183,000 jobs. Tourism remains strong \ndespite declines in other important North Carolina industries, such as \ntextiles, furniture manufacturing, and fiber optics.\n  While nationwide the tourism volume increased by less than 1 percent \nafter the tragedy of September 11, North Carolina saw a 3-percent \nincrease in its visitors, a real testament to the draw of our coastal \nareas. Last year, some 49 million visitors traveled to North Carolina \nmaking it the eighth most popular State tourist destination in the \ncountry. Tourists spent $13.2 billion across the State, generating more \nthan $1.1 billion in Federal revenue and over $1.1 billion in State and \nlocal tax revenue.\n  We have been told not to worry, all their talking about is an \ninventory. But there are two problems with this argument. The experts \nsay inventorying itself will damage these environmentally sensitive \nareas. And why would we inventory an area we do not plan to later \ndrill? The proposed inventory would be harmful to marine habitat and \nthe fishing industry because it requires seismic surveys involving \nrepetitive explosions in the water that send loud acoustic pulses \nthrough the water and into the sea floor. Scientists are concerned that \nthese sounds kill fish and disturb whales, causing whales to swim onto \nthe beach and die.\n  Advocates for an inventory label it solely as information gathering. \nBut we already know where resources are located along our coast from \ndata gathered by the Department of the Interior. Why, then, should our \nState be asked to risk environmental damage to our coastal areas for \nresources that are under moratoria and not even accessible for \ndevelopment? The potential physical price of exploration and subsequent \ndrilling, polluted beaches, disrupted marine ecosystems, lost tourism, \nspeaks to the heart of the issue. Any exploration off our coast is bad \nfor tourism and is bad for North Carolina.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes from Senator \nNelson's time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. This time agreement, if I were to ask to yield \nadditional time beyond that which we have for Senators, what would I be \nmoving up against in terms of putting the Senate in some kind of a \nproblem?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have a vote scheduled at 11 o'clock and a \nrecess at 11:30.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How many more Senators are supposed to speak on this \nissue?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Each of them have how much time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Each have 7 minutes 50 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am sorry, Senator.\n  Mrs. DOLE. I understand Senator Nelson is willing to yield 4 minutes \nof his time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent it be in order that Senator \nNelson yield 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, as an editorial in the Charlotte Observer \non March 31 of this year explains, a drilling accident threatens \neverything North Carolinians hold dear about the coast--the beaches, \nthe ocean water, the thin fish and shell fish, the pelicans and pipers, \nthe marsh grass and live oaks.\n  Allowing drilling off the coast of the Carolinas, in an area of the \nAtlantic that has some of the roughest weather in the world, is \nfoolish. I agree, indeed, it would be foolish. It is detrimental to\n\n[[Page S6874]]\n\nthose who live, work, and visit our coastal communities. It is \ndetrimental to my entire State.\n  In conclusion, let me wrap up quickly and say, once again, the \nmajority of folks in North Carolina are opposed to this drilling. That \nis why I am again proud to be a strong voice for my State in fighting \nany effort to open up the Outer Continental Shelf to oil and gas \nexploration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted \nto address the Senator for 30 seconds without being charged.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, my fellow Senators, we have heard the \nChair announce we will have a vote that is set. The Senators have time \nto speak, so they should get down here and speak. We have Senator \nLandrieu, Senator Bingaman, the distinguished majority leader--although \nhe can take time off his own time.\n  For any who have remaining time agreed to, it would serve their \npurpose if they would use their time because the time will run against \nthem. I am not going to yield. I have only 7\\1/2\\ or 8 minutes in \nopposition. I cannot yield.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of the Nelson-\nMartinez amendment, which would remove from the energy bill language \nthat threatens decades-old Congressional and Executive Branch \nprotections of sensitive coastal areas.\n  Protecting our Nation's fragile coasts is vitally important to my \nState's economy. On the west coast of Washington, the livelihoods of \nmany rural communities depend on fishing, tourism, and shellfish \nfarming. These multi-million dollar industries depend on clean water \nand pristine coastlines.\n  In addition, the U.S. has entered into numerous treaties with coastal \nIndian tribes. Many of these treaties guarantee tribal fishing and \nshellfishing harvesting rights. We cannot set in motion a process that \ncould damage these tribes' ways of life, or allow any potential \nabrogation of our Nation's trust responsibilities.\n  Over the last several years, Washington State has been a leader in \nprotecting sensitive marine areas. We worked closely with the National \nAtmospheric and Oceanic Administration to establish the Olympic Coast \nNational Marine Sanctuary, which encompasses most of the waters off of \nthe northwest coast of Washington. The sanctuary is home to hundreds of \nspecies including marine mammals.\n  These mammals include the majestic Orca whale, whose 20 percent \npopulation decline over the past decade triggered a depleted listing \nunder the Marine Mammal Protection Act and may lead to a threatened \nlisting under the Endangered Species Act. I am very concerned that the \nexploratory activities allowed under the Senate Energy Bill could \nfurther harm this important symbol of the Northwest.\n  There are those who argue that a mere inventory of off-shore oil and \ngas supplies would do no harm. But I would ask my colleagues to \nconsider emerging scientific evidence related to seismic technology \nused to conduct these surveys. Studies have suggested that these \ntechniques are more invasive than originally believed--particularly \nwhen it comes to their acoustic disruption of marine ecosystems. \nPotential interference with the sensory capacities of marine mammals \nmay jeopardize fundamental activities such as foraging for food, \navoiding predators, and caring for young.\n  Moreover, many coastal residents of my State still shudder when they \nrecall the thick carpets of oil, hundreds of dead birds, and great \nshards of oil-blackened timber that followed a 1989 oil spill off Grays \nHarbor. That disaster stained over 300 miles of coastline. An oil well \nblow out could be many times worse.\n  While some argue that this is simply a study, my response is that we \nshould not spend millions of taxpayer dollars to study something we \nknow we do not want to do. My constituents have told me they will not \naccept drilling rigs off the coast of communities like Willapa Bay, \nNeah Bay, or the mouth of the Columbia River.\n  There is an important question here. Where is it appropriate to \ndrill, and where is it inappropriate? I agree with many of the Senators \nwho have cited our Nation's growing need for more natural gas supplies. \nWhile I fully recognize this challenge, according to the EIA and MMS, \nthe potential supplies off the coast of Washington are dwarfed by at \nleast 32 trillion cubic feet of natural gas that we know already exists \nin Alaskan fields.\n  That is gas that is currently being pumped back into the ground, and \nit is the reason we need to expedite the construction of a pipeline \nfrom Alaska's North Slope to the lower 48 States. Building this \npipeline would provide years of domestic gas supply, create thousands \nof jobs, and provide a huge opportunity for the steel industry.\n  The Pew Oceans Commission has highlighted the fragility of our oceans \nand coastal resources and recommended we look at our oceans in a \nholistic manner--not through the narrow lens of oil and gas production \nbut to look at the overall benefits provided by the oceans.\n  I think the commission's findings confirm the need to reject any \nprovision that moves us towards future oil and gas drilling in National \nMarine Sanctuaries or off the coasts of protected federally owned \nnational parks and wildlife refuges.\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote for the amendment.\n  I thank the Senators from Florida for their leadership on this \nimportant issue.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues from \nFlorida, Senator Nelson and Senator Martinez, as a cosponsor of their \namendment to strike the OCS inventory language from the Energy bill.\n  I want to commend Senator Domenici and Senator Bingaman for working \nhard to craft a bipartisan bill, but I have a number of concerns with \nit, including the OCS inventory language.\n  Since 1982, Congress and the Executive branch have prohibited new \noffshore leases in the OCS. The moratoria began with California and was \nexpanded to include the rest of the west coast, Georges Bank, New \nEngland, the mid-Atlantic, part of the eastern Gulf, and portions of \nAlaska. Both President George H. W. Bush and President Clinton upheld \nthe OCS moratoria.\n  Let us be very clear. While an inventory sounds benign, it is a \ncostly endeavor that will cause irreparable harm to our coastal waters \nand set us on a slippery slope to drilling and exploration in these \nenvironmentally sensitive areas. Why else would the Federal Government \npropose to spend nearly $1 billion to conduct seismic drilling \nactivities if it did not intend to go forward with further coastal \nexploration? To suggest otherwise strains credulity. Further, nowhere \nin the underlying bill does it say how the Federal Government is going \nto pay for this $1 billion inventory. I contend that there are better \nways to invest $1 billion--health care, education, infrastructure \nimprovements, energy efficient technology, and renewable resources come \nimmediately to mind, than on a misguided attempt to open our coastal \nareas to oil and gas exploration.\n  As I mentioned, conducting an inventory would entail seismic drilling \nthat would have a ripple effect up and down our coastline. We already \nknow that this type of activity has a devastating impact on marine \nlife, including whales.\n  I am concerned that any seismic drilling or other similar activities \nalong the North Atlantic and mid-Atlantic coast would have a tremendous \nnegative impact on the health and well-being of Long Island Sound and \nthe coastal areas of Connecticut.\n  Long Island Sound is an estuary of national significance with not \none, but two openings to the sea. It is bordered by Connecticut and New \nYork, running 110 miles long and 21 miles across at its widest. More \nthan 8 million people live and vacation on or around Long Island Sound. \nConnecticut and New York have already spent millions of dollars and \ndedicated millions more to restore the health of the Long Island Sound \necosystem. A healthy habitat ensures a prosperous recreational and \ncommercial fishing industry, boating, swimming, and an overall thriving \ntourism industry. Long Island Sound provides an economic benefit of \nmore than $5 billion to the regional economy.\n  Therefore, I am deeply concerned that any attempt to inventory the \nOCS\n\n[[Page S6875]]\n\nor begin future oil and gas exploration in the Atlantic would cause \nirreparable harm to Long Island Sound and the State of Connecticut. I \ntherefore strongly support the Nelson-Martinez amendment and urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to speak for 2 \nminutes of the allotted time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, an issue not discussed so far in this \ndebate is the fact that we tried mightily to find a reasonable \ncompromise that would allow for there to be exploratory inventorying of \nthose areas which wanted it, while allowing States like Florida to opt \nout of such an inventory.\n  As we entered into those negotiations, it was unfortunate we were not \nable to seek common ground or find a way in which we could resolve it. \nThe unfortunate issue arises that it is difficult to draw these State \nboundaries in a way that allows Florida to protect not only its coast \nbut those that are adjacent to neighboring States. So as we went \nthrough this exercise, it was unfortunate we could not find that \nreasonable common ground that would have allowed us to reach a \ncompromise.\n  Unfortunately, now Florida is in the peculiar position, as is North \nCarolina, that we have no option but to object to the entirety of this \nprovision in the bill in order to protect Florida from the exploration \nor the inventorying. There is no question that inventorying is a \nprecursor to drilling, to exploration.\n  In Florida, we have had for many years a moratorium on drilling. This \nmoratorium will extend until the year 2012. It is a moratorium that has \nbeen not only observed but it has been implemented by President Bush, \nPresident Clinton, as well as by our current President. So there has \nbeen a compact, an understanding, a reasoned understanding that \nFloridians do not want this taking place off their shores--just as \nNorth Carolinians do not want it. We should have the opportunity not to \ninterfere in our own States' coastline if we do not wish to have it.\n  Right now, we would have no such option. There would be no \nopportunity to opt out, and we would have only to acquiesce to \ninventorying off the shores of Florida which, frankly, cannot be \ndrilled upon because of the current and pending moratorium.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes have expired. Who \nyields time?\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I understand, according to the unanimous \nconsent agreement, I now have 10 minutes to speak in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President. I will take all 7 minutes 15 \nseconds to talk about this important amendment.\n  I do so much respect a lot of what has been said on the floor of the \nSenate by my colleagues from Florida and New Jersey about their \nfeelings about offshore drilling. Of course, we have different feelings \nabout that in Louisiana, and our experience leads us to different \nconclusions. But that is not really the subject of this amendment, \nwhich is why I have come to the floor to speak in opposition to this \namendment.\n  This is not a drilling amendment. This is a security amendment. This \nis a good stewardship amendment. This is a commonsense amendment. The \npeople of the United States--all 240-plus million people who live in \nthis Nation--depend on us--us right here--to give them good information \nabout their country, about their land, about their water, about their \noceans, about their resources. They depend on us to tell them the \ntruth, not to hide things from them, not to pretend we have things when \nwe do not or say we do not have things when we do.\n  That is all the amendment the Senators from New Mexico--both \nSenators, the chairman and the ranking member--have put in the \nunderlying bill, with support from Democrats and Republicans, with a \ngood vote from Republicans and Democrats on the committee, to put in \nthis bill simply a direction for our agency, the Minerals Management \nService of the Department of Interior, to do an inventory so the \nAmerican public can understand how much oil, how much gas, how many \nother resources we might have on the Outer Continental Shelf.\n  No. 1, this is not a small piece of land or territory. It is 200 \nmiles basically out from our coast, a ring around the Nation. If you \ntook the OCS, which is 1.67 billion acres of land, and laid it over the \nmap of the United States, it would be from the Mississippi River to the \nPacific Coast. It is a huge asset owned not by the Senators, not by the \nHouse of Representatives, not by the Governors, it is owned by the \nAmerican people. They have a right to know what resources are there for \nthem should they need them, should they want to use them as good \nstewards--not as exploiters, not as destroyers, but as good stewards.\n  We are engaged in a war. We have had a strike against this Nation \nfrom terrorists who have all sorts of vile intentions against our \nNation.\n  The price of oil is at $58 a barrel this week. Gas is at a record \nhigh. We do not know when or if there will be another terrorist attack, \nbut in the event there is some problem--more problems than we have \ntoday because we have some, obviously--when the country may have to \ndraw on resources on the Outer Continental Shelf--it may either be \nbecause of an emergency or because of economic necessity--we most \ncertainly would like to know what is there so we can make a good \ndecision. That is basically all this underlying bill does.\n  So I know my colleagues have different views about drilling and where \ndrilling should be and whether we should drill, but this is not the \namendment. This is not the attack point. You would want to talk about \ndrilling when we get to it. This is about an inventory, a resource \nassessment of what is owned by the American people for their deliberate \nthought about what should be done either now or in the short-term \nfuture or in the long-term future of this Nation.\n  I urge all of us to vote against this amendment that would strip out \nthis commonsense approach to letting the American people know what they \nown so they can make, and we all can make, good decisions about whether \nto use those resources, when to use those resources, or decide never to \ntap into those resources. But those good, commonsense decisions cannot \neven be made unless we know what we have.\n  The good leadership of both Senators from New Mexico is leading us to \ngive the American people a full accounting. I come to the Senate floor \nthis morning to say that I strongly support this underlying measure, \nand I thank them for their leadership. I urge my colleagues on the \nDemocratic side, as well as my Republican colleagues, to hold to this \ncommonsense inventory of our Outer Continental Shelf.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following data be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                           INVENTORY/SEISMIC\n\n       Conducting seismic surveys would provide MMS with a \n     valuable tool to help predict where resources may lie beneath \n     the ocean floor and help inform the American public as to the \n     nature and value of these resources. The inventory language \n     does not eliminate existing moratoria or expand OCS access \n     and the seismic surveys described in the inventory language \n     do not constitute ``actual exploration.''\n       Industry has co-existed with the marine environment for \n     decades. In the Gulf of Mexico, new marine ecosystems have \n     been created--and are thriving--as a result of offshore \n     operations. Scientific research has not shown that seismic \n     activities harm sperm whales or other marine mammal species. \n     In it's 2004 report, ``Marine Mammal Populations and Ocean \n     Noise--Determining when Noise Causes Biologically Significant \n     Effects'', the National Research Council concluded that ``no \n     scientific studies have conclusively demonstrated a link \n     between exposure to sound and adverse effects on a marine \n     mammal population.''\n       However, MMS has implemented general instructions, \n     including mitigation measures in deepwater, to minimize any \n     possible effects of seismic surveys on marine species. Some \n     of these measures include placement of trained visual \n     observers on seismic vessels; immediate shutdown if a whale \n     is sighted within the vicinity of seismic sources; and start-\n     up procedures that require the immediate vicinity to be clear \n     of any animals before activities can proceed.\n       Annual appropriations moratoria, not cost, have prohibited \n     MMS from conducting any\n\n[[Page S6876]]\n\n     leasing or related activities in these areas for decades. Any \n     costs must be weighed against the benefits to the nation of \n     understanding the value and nature of its offshore resources.\n       Under the OCS Lands Act, Congress found a serious lack of \n     adequate basic energy information regarding OCS resources and \n     an urgent need for this information. Congress noted that this \n     information is ``essential to the national security of the \n     United States'' and directed the Secretary of the Interior to \n     maintain an inventory of the Nation's OCS undiscovered energy \n     resources as well as its discovered reserves. Using \n     sophisticated seismic technologies is key to ensuring \n     accurate resource estimates.\n\n\n           EFFECTS OF SEISMIC SURVEYS ON WHALES AND DOLPHINS\n\n       1. Environmental groups suggest sounds from seismic surveys \n     are a big problem for whales and dolphins.\n       This allegation is not supported by the science:\n       Final Programmatic Environmental Assessment (November, \n     2004). Geological and Geophysical Exploration for Mineral \n     Resources on the Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf;\n       U.S. Department of Interior--Minerals Management Service \n     (MMS 2004-054). Conclusions: Finding of No Significant Impact \n     (FONSI);\n       Marine Mammal Populations and Ocean Noise--Determining when \n     Noise Causes Biologically Significant Effects 2004 National \n     Research Council: ``No scientific studies have conclusively \n     demonstrated a link between exposure to sound and adverse \n     effects on a marine mammal population.''\n       This allegation is not supported by global experience:\n       No physical harm to whales or dolphins has ever been seen \n     or shown as a result of industry seismic operations.\n       2. Significant effort is made to ensure seismic operations \n     do not cause harm.\n       Careful assessment of the environment and possible impacts \n     from seismic operations are undertaken in advance of \n     operations.\n       A balanced, protective approach is applied when science \n     cannot provide certainty.\n       As an example, operational modifications are made to \n     provide added protection: Monitoring for the presence of \n     animals of concern; Shutdown or no start-up when they are too \n     close; Slow, gradual ramp-up of operations just in case.\n       More aggressive operational modifications are made when \n     warranted (e.g. operating in more sensitive areas).\n       3. Industry continues to spend millions of dollars annually \n     on research in this area: Base line biological knowledge; \n     Accurate assessment of potential impacts; Improving \n     operational modifications.\n       4. Concern for whales and dolphins should be focused on the \n     true threat: fishing by-catch mortalities (deaths from \n     entanglement in nets and other fishing gear).\n       WWF just issued an estimate of daily mortality due to \n     fishing by-catch (June 9, 2005 press release): ``Almost 1,000 \n     whales, dolphins and porpoises die every day in nets and \n     fishing gear. Some species are being pushed to the brink of \n     extinction.'' www.cetaceanbycatch.org\n\n\n          WILL SEISMIC SURVEYS HARM RIGHT AND HUMPBACK WHALES?\n\n       If environmental groups say no to a limited lifting of the \n     moratoria off the Eastern Seaboard because it is home to \n     endangered Right and Humpback Whales, the following points \n     should be considered in the debate:\n       The biggest threat to both are from ship strikes and \n     entanglement in fishing gear, not sounds from seismic \n     exploration.\n       The seasonal migration of both species is well known and \n     documented (they go south for the winter).\n       Seismic operations can easily be conducted in the seasons \n     when the animals are away.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I yield back the floor but reserve my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Time is equally charged to both sides if no one yields time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I assume the time is going to be charged \nproportionately against all the remaining speakers?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time will be equally charged against each side \nif no one yields time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Do we need a \nquorum call for that to occur?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No. That occurs without a quorum call.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Domenici). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I have been yielded 4 minutes of \nSenator Bingaman's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, we are talking today about whether to \nfind out how much natural gas we have offshore. Let me try to put that \nin personal terms. In the mountains of east Tennessee, we have a \ncompany, Tennessee Eastman. Mr. President, 10,000, 12,000 jobs are \nthere. They have been good-paying jobs for several generations. They \nmake chemicals at Eastman Chemical. Their raw material is natural gas. \nThe cost of that gas has gone from the lowest in the world to the \nhighest in the world. If it stays that way, those jobs will not be in \nTennessee; they will be moving overseas.\n  There are 1 million blue-collar manufacturing jobs in America in the \nchemical industry that depend on natural gas for a raw material. We \nmust lower the price of natural gas. We can do it by conservation. That \nis in the Domenici-Bingaman bill we are considering. We can do it by \nnuclear power, which we need to accelerate. Support for that is in the \nDomenici bill. We can do it someday, we hope, by coal gasification.\n  But right now we have $7 gas, the highest in the industrial world, we \nare building all our new powerplants for natural gas, and we are \nrefusing to find out how much natural gas we have offshore to supply \nmore and reduce the price. So we have farmers who are taking a pay cut, \nhomeowners who cannot heat and cool their homes, we have blue-collar \nworkers across this country who are going to have their jobs shifted \noverseas, and what we are saying is we do not even want to know how \nmuch gas we have.\n  We can have a later debate about whether to give more States the \noption, as Texas does, as Louisiana does, as Alabama does, to drill for \noil and gas. You can do it today 20 miles offshore. You will never see \nit. It is environmentally clean. That is not the debate here today.\n  The debate today--and the Presiding Officer brought it up last year--\nif we are in a crisis on natural gas, if we have jobs moving overseas, \nwhy don't we want to know how much natural gas we have?\n  So I hope we will oppose this amendment and support the Domenici-\nBingaman legislation, which puts us on a path toward a low-carbon \nproduction of energy plan for our future. It is an essential part of \nthat. I hope we defeat the amendment and support the Domenici-Bingaman \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment to strike \nthe Outer Continental Shelf inventory provision. During committee \nconsideration of the bill, I supported adding this provision which \nrequires a comprehensive survey of OCS oil and gas resources. I \ncontinue to support the provision. These resources belong to the entire \nNation. I believe it is useful for us to know the extent of the oil and \ngas resources underlying the OCS.\n  It is important to note what the underlying provision does not do. \nThe provision does not modify or rescind any moratorium. The provision \ndoes not allow drilling in any area that is covered by a moratorium. \nThe provision does, however, provide for the development of important \ndata and information about our energy resources. The language in the \nbill is identical to a provision that was approved in the Energy \nCommittee during the last Congress, and the Senate rejected efforts to \nstrike the language then. I hope we will have the same outcome on this \nissue in this Congress.\n  I oppose the amendment. I encourage my colleagues to oppose it as \nwell.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I appreciate the support of Senator \nBingaman.\n  The Energy and Natural Resources Committee included the language \nwhich is going to be stricken if the amendment passes. I urge the \nSenate not to strike the language. All Americans today are looking at \nthe gas pump. They are seeing the price. The average price in the \nUnited States is $2.13. That means something. They go home and they \nwonder about it. They ask questions: What are we going to do about it?\n  Americans should know that not at the gas pump but out there across \nthe land there is another phenomenon occurring. That is the terrific \nincrease in the price of natural gas, this marvelous product that years \nago we didn't think we had very much of, and then we started finding \nit. All of a sudden we\n\n[[Page S6877]]\n\nthought we had an amount which we would never run out of. So we started \nputting it in the big powerplants because it is clean. We pumped it in \nby the trillions of cubic feet to produce electricity.\n  Now, all of a sudden the price is going up because demand has gone up \ndramatically. It has increased 300 percent in a short period of time. \nIt is predicted, if something doesn't happen, the price could go as \nhigh as $13; today it is only $7. It was at one time down in the \nneighborhood of $1.50 or $2. That means if it continues to go up, we \nwill have no fertilizer business in America. We will have no chemical \nbusiness in America. Natural gas, which we use in our powerplants, will \nbegin to run out. We are using it for all kinds of purposes. Then we \nwill understand. We don't understand it right now.\n  All we are saying is, America, out there in the ocean, 200 miles, you \ncan put these drilling platforms--I flew out and landed on one--you can \nput them out there. People have seen them on television. They are \nabsolutely tremendous technological feats. There is no pollution. \nNothing happens except 10 or 12 wells are drilled, this valuable \nresource that we own comes up, and we use it.\n  We thought it was very important for our citizens to know how much \nnatural gas or crude oil exists out there. Nothing is going to happen \nto the States. Nothing is being changed versus the States. The \nmoratoria exist. If we brought a moratoria amendment up here and said, \nlift the moratorium on Florida, it would lose. The bill would die. A \nfilibuster would occur.\n  We are not asking for that. As a matter of fact, the bill says you \ncan't even drill to determine the assets that America owns. It will be \ndone by new, modern technology, seismic and otherwise, that in a few \nyears will say to America, through Congress, to the President--and it \nwill be a truthful, full disclosure, a transparency--America, if you \nhave a problem, you have some alternatives. You can import natural gas \nin big ships that will bring it over here in a liquefied manner. We \nwill still be paying foreign countries for it. We don't know if the \nprice will come down. We don't know if they will have a cartel. They \ndon't now. But if I were them, they are not subject to any national \nlaws of ours, they could form a cartel. Natural gas could keep going \nup. We would keep importing it.\n  I can tell the American people, if we have this asset out there and \nsome State thinks that maybe we ought to drill, or the United States of \nAmerica believes we are throttled, we ought to know what is there. That \nis all. Some decision can be made in the future.\n  I say to my fellow Senators, please understand, this is not a \nproposal to change any moratoria. This is not a proposal to harm the \nState of Florida. We compliment the distinguished Senators, Mr. \nMartinez and Mr. Nelson, who have argued eloquently on behalf of their \nState. Senator Dole has been here. The Senator from New Jersey has been \nhere. We recognize all of them.\n  Did Senator Bingaman have any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Bingaman has 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Senator Domenici may have my 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  What we are asking is nothing more, nothing less than on behalf of \nthe American people, let the experts go out and find out how much is \nthere. In a rather superficial way, without having ever done the real \nseismic work, we have an idea of what is there, across the circle \naround America that has been described so eloquently by Senator \nLandrieu. We know somewhat what is there. But we don't know with any \nkind of assurance. We need that. That is what the amendment is about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I tell the Senator, the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee, we already know what is out \nthere.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, is not a vote in order at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes left.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, again, I tell the Senator that \nwe already know what is out there. In fact, the MMS does an inventory \nevery 5 years. Here is the latest one. This is a 2003 update. The new \none will come out this summer, in 2005. So we are not doing an \ninventory here as it is explained. What we are doing under this bill is \ndoing something new. We are doing seismic explosions that could cost \nthe Federal Government, in all of the Outer Continental Shelf, up to a \nbillion dollars.\n  Seismic explosions. These air guns shoot air pressure all the way to \nthe surface of the ocean floor. Now, that is what we are trying to \nstop. Since we know what is there--and they drilled several dry holes \nin the eastern Gulf of Mexico, off Florida. We know there is not any \noil and gas there. They want to do a new type of exploration. Yet this \nis in a moratorium. So if it is in a moratorium until the year 2012, \nwhy are we going to allow, under this bill, going out and doing seismic \nexplosions in the Outer Continental Shelf all around the United States? \nIt makes no sense.\n  What it is is the first step to drilling. It is the proverbial \ncamel's nose under the tent. Once he gets his nose under the tent, the \ncamel is going to get in the tent, the tent is going to collapse, and \nthere is going to be drilling all off the coast of Florida, all off the \neastern seaboard and all off the western Pacific coastline.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida, Mr. Martinez, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, my understanding is that I have one \nminute to close.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That time has expired.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute to close on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I simply want to note that I am very \nappreciative of the chairman and ranking member of the committee where \nI have had the pleasure of working. I believe this is a great and good \nbill. I want to take this one little provision out that would do so \nmuch harm to the people of Florida and would be potentially invasive to \nour future. I want to remove it so that we can continue forward with \nthis good bill.\n  I believe, without question, the issue here is not just about these \ninventories but about future drilling. We cannot drill ourselves to \nenergy sufficiency by what we might find in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment so we can take out \nthis one piece of the bill, and the bill can be a successful bill. Then \nwe can go into conference and provide an energy future for our country \nthat is desperately needed. There are many things I want to vote for in \nthe bill. I continue to be greatly concerned about not just an \ninventory but about where that path would lead. This is not only for \nthe people of Florida but many other coastal Senators have expressed \nthemselves as this being in the best interests of many of our States. I \nyield back my time.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from South Dakota (Mr. Thune).\n  Mr. DURBIN.

ETHANOL CONTENT OF GASOLINE.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Cellulosic biomass ethanol.--The term ``cellulosic \n     biomass ethanol'' means ethanol derived from any \n     lignocellulosic or hemicellulosic matter that is available on \n     a renewable or recurring basis, including--\n       (A) dedicated energy crops and trees;\n       (B) wood and wood residues;\n       (C) plants;\n       (D) grasses;\n       (E) agricultural residues; and\n       (F) fibers.\n       (2) Waste derived ethanol.--The term ``waste derived \n     ethanol'' means ethanol derived from--\n       (A) animal wastes, including poultry fats and poultry \n     wastes, and other waste materials; or\n       (B) municipal solid waste.\n       (3) Ethanol.--The term ``ethanol'' means cellulosic biomass \n     ethanol and waste derived ethanol.\n       (b) Renewable Fuel Program.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this section, the Secretary shall promulgate \n     regulations ensuring that each gallon of gasoline sold or \n     dispensed to consumers in the contiguous United States \n     contains 10 percent ethanol by 2015.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, we have been talking about the laudable \ngoals of recycling, our Nation's dependency on foreign oil, and \ndeveloping alternative sources of energy. The old saying goes, actions \nspeak louder than words. Our current energy program and practices are \ntaking this country in the opposite direction--toward increased imports \nof foreign oil.\n  Even with the renewable fuel standard in the Senate bill, which some \nwant to eliminate, the projected gasoline consumption in our country \nwill increase from 135 billion gallons this year to 168 billion gallons \nin 2012. That is a 26-percent increase in America's use of gasoline in \njust 7 years. At a time that worldwide demand is also expected to \nincrease significantly, where we will get the increased supplies? How \nmuch will we have to pay for them?\n  As my colleague, Senator Cantwell from Washington State, courageously \nwarned last week, even with the adoption of the Senate's renewable fuel \nstandard, our imports of foreign oil would increase from 59 percent \ncurrently to 62 percent in 2012. Without adopting the Senate renewable \nfuel standard, our oil imports would be over 67 percent in just 7 \nyears.\n  Taking yesterday's world price for oil, which was over $59 a barrel, \nwe will spend $220 billion this year for foreign imports of oil, and we \nwould spend $243 billion in 2012, even with the renewable fuel \nstandard. Anyone who believes the world price of oil in 2012 will not \nbe higher than it is today is beyond optimistic.\n  Of course, if we can continue to get all the oil we need at today's \nprices or lower, we would have no need to develop alternatives. That \nhas been our national energy strategy today. People say we do not have \nan energy policy. I respectfully disagree. Our policy has been and \ncontinues to be to maintain the status quo for as long as possible. We \ncontinue to depend almost entirely upon oil and oil products, natural \ngas and its products, coal, nuclear, and hydroelectric power for over \n97 percent of our total energy needs nationwide, just as we did in 1970 \nbefore our so-called energy crisis began.\n  The so-called alternative fuels provided less than 2 percent of our \ncountry's energy in 1970. They provide less than 3 percent today. None \nof them are likely to provide significantly more of our total supply 10 \nor even 20 years from now except for ethanol and other biofuels such as \nbiodiesel. That is why we do not see full-page ads attacking solar, \nwind, or geothermal energy by the Petroleum Institute or other major \nenergy sources, because they know the alternatives are no threat to \nreplace them anytime soon.\n  The only alternative source of energy the American Petroleum \nInstitute is attacking is ethanol. Why is that huge industry, oil and \ngas special interest, spreading misinformation about a business \ncompetitor? Because they recognize that ethanol has the ability--not \njust potential but the ability now, not 10, 20, or 40 years from now \nbut right now--to replace gasoline, to replace not just MTBE, the--3 \npercent additive to regular gasoline, but to replace the gasoline \nitself.\n  I know that from my own experience driving a Ford Explorer that has \nrun on a blend of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline all over \nMinnesota during the past 3 years. My Senate office leased a van that \nhas run on the 85 percent fuel for the last 4 years. Both vehicles have \nfactory-made flexible-fuel engines which can run on the 85-\n\n[[Page S6879]]\n\npercent ethanol or on regular unleaded gasoline or any mixture of the \ntwo. However, for the past 9 years, every car, SUV, or pickup truck in \nMinnesota has run on a blend of 90 percent gasoline and 10 percent \nethanol.\n\n  The courageous Republican Governor, Arne Carlson, and the Minnesota \nLegislature passed a 10-percent ethanol mandate law. Back then, the oil \nand gas industries tried the same scare tactics they are using on \nCapitol Hill now: More ethanol will be prohibitively expensive, unsafe, \nand unreliable. But for the last 9 years, every motorist in Minnesota \nhas put a gasoline containing 10 percent ethanol into every vehicle at \nevery service station with no problems and at prices that are lower \nthan our neighboring States. Just 2 weeks ago, I bought E85 fuel in 11 \nMinnesota cities at prices ranging from 25 to 70 cents a gallon less \nthan regular unleaded gasoline. Unleaded gas costs between $1.90 and \n$2.05 a gallon and E85 between $1.35 and $1.65 a gallon.\n  I have introduced legislation that will require all of the gasoline-\nconsuming cars, SUVs, and trucks sold in America after 2008 to have \nthese flex-fuel engines which would give their owners the choice \nbetween ethanol and gasoline every time they fueled up. Every time, \nconsumers could choose the lower priced option, and that consumer \nchoice would provide healthy competition for both fuels.\n  Certainly there are other good reasons to buy ethanol instead of \ngasoline, such as putting that money into the pockets of American \nfarmers rather than Arab sheiks or using a cleaner burning ethanol fuel \nthat is better for engines and the environment. However, the automobile \nindustry will not support such an engine requirement because not enough \nconsumers ask for it or insist upon those flex-fuel engines, even \nthough on most models there is no difference to consumers in the \nsticker price. Without consumer demand, most service stations do not \nyet carry E85 fuel.\n  When I visited Ford and General Motors plants recently to better \nunderstand their challenges and costs in designing, producing, and \nselling vehicles with flex-fuel engines, I told their engineer and \nexecutives that the transition to fleets with flex-fuel engines could \nonly occur with their support, not over their opposition. After all, \nthey make the engines, warranty them, and service them. I was greatly \nimpressed with their success in designing and manufacturing those \nengines that can measure the ethanol content in a fuel tank from 0 to \n85 percent and adjust the fuel intake and carburetor to burn a more \ndense 87 octane gasoline or a less dense 104 octane ethanol, or any \nblend of the two, and then produce the same acceleration efficiency and \nother performances from either fuel.\n  If E85, without its tax subsidies, now equivalent to 43 cents a \ngallon, and after accounting for its 15-percent fewer miles per gallon \nbecause of its lesser density, is still cheaper than regular unleaded \ngas, which it is at its current price in many parts of Minnesota, then \nsavvy consumers, of whom there are now 100,000 in Minnesota, will \ndecide they, too, are sick of ever higher and higher gasoline prices \nand they, too, want to take advantage of ethanol's lower cost and \nequal, if not better, performance in their engines. Then when consumers \nask for and insist upon flex-fuel engines at no additional cost in the \nvehicles they buy, automobile manufacturers will produce them. \nA marketplace will drive that transition. My bill would accelerate it, \nbut this Congress and this country are not yet ready for that \nconversion.\n\n  My other legislation, Senate amendment No. 790, would have an even \ngreater impact on our country's energy independence, on reducing our \nimports of foreign oil, on putting more of that $220 billion we now \nsend out of our country to import that foreign oil into our U.S. \neconomy instead.\n  This bill would require that in 10 years, the rest of America would \ndo what Minnesota has done for the past 9 years--require that every \ngallon of gasoline contain at least 10 percent ethanol. Right now, the \nnationwide use of ethanol is about 2.5 percent of gasoline. The \nSenate's renewable fuel standard in this bill would raise nationwide \nethanol consumption to almost 5 percent of gasoline by 2012--an amount \nof gasoline which I said earlier is expected to be 26 percent more than \nwhat we are consuming this year nationwide.\n  For the gasoline that is refined from that oil, 62 percent of which \nwould be imported foreign oil with our renewable fuel standard, \nreplacing 5 percent of that gasoline with ethanol is real progress, but \nit is small progress. It is only half of what we could achieve by a 10-\npercent ethanol mandate nationwide. Ten percent of the 168 billion \ngallons of gasoline that Americans are projected to consume in 2012 \nwould be 16.8 billion gallons of fuel. If gasoline remained at $2 a \ngallon, substituting ethanol for 10 percent would shift almost $34 \nbillion each year from a nonrenewable fuel, over half of it foreign, to \nannually rely on American grown and American manufactured oil that \ncould supply over half of all that oil and gasoline.\n  Now we see why the American Petroleum Institute is attacking ethanol \nand why, regrettably, it has convinced some of my Senate colleagues to \ndo the same. I am deeply dismayed by accusations made in the Senate \nthat I and other ethanol proponents are trying to foist some huge \nadditional costs on American motorists in order to increase the profits \nof one company or to create some profits for our Midwestern farmers. I \nam beholden to no company or industry. I certainly support policies \nthat benefit Minnesota farmers, but I would never, ever try to advance \ntheir economic interests at the expense of all other Americans.\n  Americans are almost certain to be plagued by higher energy prices in \nthe years ahead. They do not deserve any congressional action that \nwould cause those prices to go even higher. Americans do, however, want \ncongressional leadership to redirect our country away from our \ncontinued reliance on the same energy sources--oil, natural gas, coal, \nand nuclear--and they know we cannot replace something with nothing.\n  It is true that conservation--using less energy--remains our best \nenergy alternative. Individually and collectively, Americans will need \nto conserve more and consume less energy in the future. That \nconservation is essential, but it is not enough. If we are to reduce \nour national consumption of oil and oil products, we will have to \nreplace them with something else. Electric cars, hydrogen cells, and \nhybrids may sound good, but they are years away from being able to \nreplace gasoline. Ethanol can replace gasoline today.\n  Ethanol is cheaper than gasoline in Minnesota today. That may not yet \nbe true on the west coast or the east coast due to transportation costs \nbecause most ethanol is transported in relatively small amounts by \ntruck or by rail rather than in large quantities by pipelines.\n  A nationwide commitment to increased use of ethanol would involve \ndeveloping a transportation system or, better yet, producing ethanol \nlocally, as Minnesota farm co-ops are doing today.\n  Ethanol can be made from many different sources, including wood \nchips, corn stalks, organic garbage, and even animal waste. I will \nrejoice when California, New York, and other farmers and small business \nentrepreneurs begin to produce ethanol and sell it locally or \nregionally. They can make decent profits while still offering consumers \nlower fuel prices for cleaner burning fuels. If they fail to do so, \nconsumers can continue to buy gasoline, but they will have a choice.\n  Again, none of this would be necessary if we could continue to get \nall the oil and gasoline we need at prices no higher than they are \ntoday. In the past, we have taken that gamble, and most of the time we \nhave come out ahead. That is evidently what we will continue to do, \ndespite the benefits of this legislation, even if those benefits \nsurvive a conference with the House and the administration and if they \nsurvive all the efforts to defeat them by the American Petroleum \nInstitute and the other established energy interests because they will \nstill make their profits, no matter how much their energy prices \nincrease, as long as Americans have no alternatives.\n  They profit and the rest of us pay. That will not change unless we \ntake action to change it. We cannot, and we will not, change our \ndependence on foreign oil or on any of our current energy sources by \nwishing them away or by making speeches about alternatives or by \nwaiting for the next energy crisis to demand them. We have to take \nactions--and sustain those actions--to\n\n[[Page S6880]]\n\nmake the transition to using significant amounts of other sources of \nenergy and to use enough of them for long enough to enable new \nentrepreneurs and expanding businesses to produce those supplies, \ntransport them, sell them, and service them.\n  There is no magic wand. There is no overnight cure. There is not even \na guaranteed success. There is only the choice to try to maintain the \nsame old energy supplies and pay for them or to develop real \nalternatives. Ethanol is ready now. And when America is ready, I will \noffer my amendments again.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 790 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw amendment No. 790.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I thank my colleague \nfrom Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 817\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, Senators \nPryor, Alexander, Landrieu, Craig, Dole, Murkowski, Voinovich, and \nStevens, to offer an amendment to H.R. 6, the Energy Policy Act of \n2005.\n  This amendment incorporates two bills I introduced earlier this year, \nthe Climate Change Technology Deployment Act and the Climate Change \nTechnology Deployment in Developing Countries Act. Taken together, \nthese bills propose a comprehensive, effective U.S. global climate \nchange policy.\n  The climate change debate is not a debate about who is for or against \nthe environment. No one wants dirty air, dirty water, prolonged drought \nor declining standards of living for their children or grandchildren. \nWe all agree on the need for a clean environment and stable climate.\n  The debate is not about whether we should take action but, rather, \nwhat kind of action we should take. A sound energy policy must include \nsensible and effective climate policies reflecting the reality that \nstrong economic growth and abundant clean energy supplies go hand in \nhand.\n  The amendment my colleagues and I are offering is comprehensive and \npractical. Bringing in the private sector, creating incentives for \ntechnological innovation, and enlisting developing countries as \npartners will all be critical to real progress on global climate \npolicy. This amendment seeks to do exactly that, by authorizing new \nprograms, policies, and incentives to reduce greenhouse gas intensity.\n  It focuses on expanding clean energy supplies, enhancing the role of \ntechnology, establishing partnerships between the public and private \nsectors and between the U.S. and developing countries. Innovation and \ntechnology are the building blocks for an effective and sustainable \nclimate policy.\n\n  This amendment uses greenhouse gas intensity as a measure of success. \nGreenhouse gas intensity is the measurement of how efficiently a nation \nuses carbon-emitting fuels and technology in producing goods and \nservices. It best captures the links between energy efficiency, \neconomic development, and the environment.\n  The first section of this amendment supports establishing domestic \npublic-private partnerships for demonstration projects that employ \ngreenhouse gas intensity reduction technologies. These provisions are \nsimilar to those of title XIV of H.R. 6 but are tied more directly to \nclimate policy. This plan provides credit-based financial assistance \nand investment protection for American businesses and projects that \ndeploy advanced climate technologies and systems. Federal financial \nassistance includes direct loans, loan guarantees, standby interest \ncoverage, and power production incentive payments.\n  We are most successful in confronting the most difficult and \ncomplicated issues when we draw on the strength of the private sector. \nPublic-private partnerships meld together the institutional leverage of \nthe Government with the innovation of industry.\n  This amendment directs the Secretary of Energy to lead an interagency \nprocess to develop and implement a national climate technology strategy \ndeveloped by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. \nIt establishes an executive branch Climate Coordinating Committee and \nClimate Credit Board to assess, approve, and fund these projects.\n  The second section of this amendment provides the Secretary of State \nwith new authority for coordinating assistance to developing countries \nfor projects and technologies that reduce greenhouse gas intensity. \nCurrent international approaches to global climate change overlook the \nrole of developing countries as part of either the problem or the \nsolution. That is, at best, unrealistic and shortsighted.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, China is already the \nworld's second largest consumer of oil, with its demand projected to \nmore than double over the next 25 years. It is estimated that coal-\nburning emissions by China alone, over the next 25 years, would be \ntwice the emissions reductions that would be achieved if all nations \nthat ratified the Kyoto Protocol met their obligations. China and other \ndeveloping nations will not be able to achieve greenhouse gas \nreductions until they achieve higher standards of living. They lack \nclean energy technology, and they cannot absorb the economic impact of \nnecessary changes to reduce emissions reductions. New policies will \nrequire recognition of the limitations of developing nations to meet \nthese standards and the necessity of including them in future emission-\nreduction initiatives.\n  This amendment works with those limitations by supporting the \ndevelopment of a U.S. global climate strategy to expand the role of the \nprivate sector, develop public-private partnerships, and encourage the \ndeployment of greenhouse gas intensity reducing technologies in \ndeveloping countries.\n  Further, this amendment directs the Secretary of State to engage \nglobal climate change as a foreign policy issue. It directs the U.S. \nTrade Representative to identify trade-related barriers to the export \nof greenhouse gas intensity reducing technologies and establishes an \ninteragency working group to promote the export of greenhouse gas \nintensity reducing technologies and practices from the United States.\n  Finally, the amendment authorizes fellowship and exchange programs \nfor foreign officials to visit the United States and acquire the \nexpertise and knowledge to reduce greenhouse gas intensity in their \ncountries.\n  The action we take must be as comprehensive as possible in order to \nbe effective in reducing international greenhouse gas emissions. That \nmeans any climate change initiatives we adopt must capture the links \nbetween energy use, the environment, and economic development in a \nglobal context.\n  Climate change does not recognize national borders. It is an \ninternational issue. It is a shared responsibility for all nations. \nFocusing on solutions that are too narrow may resolve one problem just \nto create or exacerbate another problem somewhere else in the world.\n  Consider, for example, the U.S. manufacturing sector. According to \none recent study written for the National Association of Manufacturers, \nthis sector accounts for some 15 million jobs in the United States, \nproducing everything from semiconductors to food products. It is a \ncornerstone of our economy, and it is the largest consumer of energy in \nour country.\n  Rising energy costs and shrinking supply, especially of natural gas, \nare already a factor in the loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs today. \nThese rising costs, in part a result of regulations and other self-\nimposed limitations, contribute to a less competitive position for U.S. \ncompanies around the world--just as the world economy is becoming \nincreasingly more and more competitive.\n\n  Some of these companies are going out of business. Others are going \noffshore to locations with lower costs and more accessible energy \nsources. In the end, long-term success will come from stimulating \nincreased energy efficiency and new lower carbon systems, not from \nactions that set up a system to continually constrain energy supplies.\n  There are viable policy options for protecting the environment \nwithout sacrificing economic performance in manufacturing and other \nsectors here in this country or in other nations. That will involve \nensuring adequate supplies of energy at globally competitive prices. By \npromoting new energy supplies and clean energy technologies, we could \npotentially add millions of new jobs and improve our economic \nperformance, as well as the economic\n\n[[Page S6881]]\n\nperformance of all nations, increasing all standards of living across \nthe globe, assuring more stability and secure living environments \naround the world, with less conflict, less war around the world.\n  At the same time, there are policies under discussion today that \nwould restrict energy supplies either now or in the future. These \npolicies would hurt our economic performance without necessarily \nimproving environmental quality. Too often, such policies are \nconsidered in isolation of other real-life factors instead of \ncomprehensively and internationally.\n  America's climate policy needs to be a comprehensive policy that \ncaptures the links between our energy use and our economic and \nenvironmental well-being. That will mean expanding the availability of \ncleaner fuels and improving the efficiency of our energy use and \nproduction through new technologies. Right now, fuel substitution \npossibilities are limited, and the rate of innovation is not fast \nenough to keep pace with our demand.\n  Natural gas supplies in the U.S. are constricted. No new nuclear \npowerplants have been constructed in many years. Renewables are \npromising but not at an adequate level of development for the needs of \nour growing dynamic economy.\n  Achieving reductions in greenhouse gas emissions is one of the more \nimportant challenges of our time. We recognize that. In developing a \nsound energy policy, however, America has an opportunity and a \nresponsibility for global climate policy leadership. But it is a \nresponsibility to be shared by all nations.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with my colleagues; the Bush \nadministration, which has done a significant amount in dealing with \nthis issue, especially in market-based, technology-driven projects; the \nprivate sector, from which innovation comes; the public interest groups \nthat help focus our attention; and America's allies--American's \nallies--key to any achievable climate change policies. I look forward \nto working with all of these individuals, institutions, bodies, and \nnations to achieve a climate change policy that is workable, \nsustainable.\n  By harnessing our many strengths, we can help shape a worthy future \nfor all people in the world.\n  I encourage my colleagues to review this amendment, and I ask for \ntheir consideration and support.\n  Mr. President, I thank you and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me say how proud I am to speak in \nbehalf of and in favor of the climate change amendment we have just \nheard thoroughly explained by Senator Hagel and to thank him and \nSenator Pryor for joining in a bipartisan way to provide for us the \nunderpinnings of a path forward on the issue of climate change and to \nmeet both this Nation's and the global needs that are obvious when we \ntalk about climate change and, in that context, economic progress.\n  In addition, this legislation will provide a sound basis for \nproductive engagements with our friends and allies in sharing a need to \ncooperatively work literally around the globe on this issue. If we are \ntalking about climate change, we are not talking about it only in the \nUnited States. It is literally the climate of the world we are talking \nabout and a concern about those elements that are introduced by man \ninto the environment that make the change or could make the change.\n  An essential element in this legislation is an active engagement of \ndeveloping countries. My views on this point are not new, but I do \nbelieve they are worth repeating as we begin this important debate on \nnational energy policy and as we step into the arena of climate change.\n  Our policy must recognize the legitimate needs of our bilateral \ntrading partners to use their resources and meet their needs for their \npeople. For too long, the climate policy debate has been about fixing \nand assigning blame and inflicting pain. This is most harmful. It is \ncounterproductive. When the climate change community said to the world, \nsave the world by turning out your lights and turning off your \neconomies, the world in large part said: Wait a moment. We don't think \nwe can do that. We have to look at this issue differently.\n  Our best technological advances, our research activities, all are \nfocusing on how we become cleaner. And as we become cleaner, we \nimmediately provide and send that technology to the world, and we meet \ntheir needs while they grow and develop and provide for their own \npeople.\n  Senator Hagel, Senator Pryor, and those of us who support this \namendment have made it clear that there are important issues we ought \nto be about when we talk about climate change. Above all, this \nlegislation is a true acknowledgment that climate variability and \nchange is a top priority of the United States and of all nations, and \nwe have not shirked from that. There can be an honest debate about \nwhether the United States should do more or whether too much reliance \nis being placed on voluntary initiatives. But to claim that the United \nStates is not acting seriously reflects at best a lack of knowledge or \nat worst political posturing.\n  An objective review of government and private sector programs to \nreduce increases in greenhouse gases now and in the future would have \nto conclude that the United States is doing at least as much, if not \nmore, than countries that are part of the Kyoto Protocol which went \ninto effect last February. The best evidence of this is our domestic \nrate of improvement in greenhouse gas intensity relative to \nimprovements in other countries. The term I just used--and it is one we \nought to all become familiar with because it is the true measurement of \nthis issue, not the politics of the issue, it is in fact the scientific \nmeasurement--``greenhouse gas intensities'' is defined in the \nlegislation Senator Hagel has just offered as the ratio of greenhouse \ngas emissions to economic output. This is a far wiser measure of \nprogress because it compliments rather than conflicts with a nation's \ngoal of growing its economy and meeting the needs of its aspiring \ncitizens.\n  Too much attention has been paid to the mandatory nature of Kyoto, \nand too little is resulting from it because nations simply can't go \nthere. Most of the countries that ratified Kyoto will not meet the \ngreenhouse gas reduction targets by the deadlines required by Kyoto. So \nwhy did they ratify it? Was it the politics of the issue or were they \nreally intent on meeting the goals? We did not ratify it because we \nknew that it couldn't be done in this country. Yet we are the most \ntechnologically advanced country of the world.\n  Why couldn't it be done here? Simple reason: When we stated on the \nfloor some years ago that we would have to take a hit of at least 3 \nmillion jobs in our country to dial ourselves down to meet the Kyoto \nstandards, we were right. In fact, at the depths of this last recession \nwe have just come out of, with 2.9 million people unemployed, we met \nthe standards that we were supposed to meet under Kyoto. Most \nfascinating is the recent news that Great Britain needs more allocation \nof credits to meet its targets under Kyoto.\n  Imagine this, the most aggressive advocate of Kyoto, the nation best \npositioned to meet the requirements of the treaty, is now backsliding \nbecause they can't hit their targets. They need more relief.\n  At a recent COP-10--that is a climate change conference in Buenos \nAires I attended along with many of our colleagues--delegates from a \nvariety of countries came up to us and said very clearly, we need the \nintensity approach in order to avert harsh, clearly unmanageable, \nunattainable consequences of Kyoto. Indeed, a conference delegate from \nItaly informed me and others attending COP-10 that Italy will bow out--\nthey were early to ratify Kyoto--by 2012 because they couldn't comply \nwith phase 2 of the treaty. Remarkable stuff? No. Real stuff. Now that \nthe politics have died down, in every country except this one, where we \nstill want some degree of political expression--now that the politics \nhave died down in these other countries that have ratified the treaty, \nthey don't know what to do because they can't get there.\n\n  Let me tell you what they can do. They can follow the guidance and \ndirection of the Hagel-Pryor amendment that I hope will become law. In \nthat law we will engage with them in the use of our technology to \nadvance a cleaner fuel system and systems for the world and not have to \nask them to turn their economy down.\n\n[[Page S6882]]\n\n  The United States is currently spending in excess of $5 billion \nannually on scientific and technological initiatives. That is far more \nthan any other nation in the world. In fact, I believe we are spending \nmore as a nation than all of the other nations combined on the issue of \ncleaner emissions--therefore, proclimate change, pro-Kyoto. But nobody \ntalks about it because it wasn't one bill. It wasn't one vote. It \nwasn't a great big press conference. It is a collective initiative on \nthe part of our Government with some of our direction over the course \nof a decade to become better at what we do and cleaner in how we do it.\n  The Bush administration has entered into more than a dozen bilateral \nagreements with other countries to improve their energy efficiencies \nand reduce greenhouse gas growth rates and has received compliments \nfrom major industries and worked with them to make improvements in the \nuse and the effective efficiencies of their energy sources. These \nprograms are designed to advance our state of knowledge, accelerate the \ndevelopment and deployment of energy technologies, aid developing \nnations in using energy more efficiently, and achieve the 18-percent \nreduction in energy intensity by 2012, as our President laid out.\n  Domestically, the United States continues to make world-leading \ninvestments in climate change and climate science technology. The \nUnited States has also implemented a wide range of national greenhouse \ngas control initiatives, carbon sequestration, and international \ncollaborative agreements.\n  Let me cite from a summary of what we have done: The climate change \ntechnology program, a $3 billion program; the climate change science \nprogram, a $2 billion program; DOE's registry for greenhouse gas \nreporting, another major program; DOE's climate vision partnership for \nindustry reductions that includes 12 major industry sectors and the \nBusiness Roundtable.\n  Here are some examples: Refineries committed to improve energy \nefficiency by 10 percent between 2002 and 2012. The chemical industry \nwill improve greenhouse gas intensity by 18 percent between 1990 and \n2012. Mining sites committed to increase efficiency by 10 percent. That \nis in that initiative alone.\n  EPA'S climate leaders for individual company reductions: Over 60 \nmajor corporate-wide reduction goals are in place, including GM, Alcoa, \nBritish Petroleum, IBM, Pfizer, and the list goes on and on.\n  We could spend an hour talking about the initiatives that are \nunderway in this country. What I told the chairman of the Energy \nCommittee last night as we discussed the issue of climate change was: \nMr. Chairman, we ought to take this whole bill and call it the climate \nchange bill of 2005. Why? Clean coal, wind, solar, nuclear, hydrogen--\nall kinds of incentives and new technologies all designed to keep this \neconomy roaring and to keep the economy greener, if you want to say it \nthat way, certainly to keep it cleaner.\n  Remember the term that I used a few moments ago when I talked about \nthe term in the legislation, to dramatically improve our greenhouse gas \nintensity as it relates to emissions per units of economic output. That \nis where the Hagel-Pryor bill goes. That is where this Senate ought to \nbe going. But we still have an attitude around here that you have to \npoint fingers and you have to inflict pain because that is the only way \nyou can sell an idea to the American people. That is wrong. We have \nalready proven that if we were to walk the walk and talk the talk of \nKyoto, there would be 3 million Americans not working today. How would \nwe deal with that? A wink and a nod and simply say we did it because it \nmakes the world cleaner? I know what my young sons would say who might \nbe out of work as a result of that. They would say: Dad, we are the \nsmartest country in the world. We are the most technologically \nadvanced. We can't figure out a way to do it better?\n  Yes, we can. And we are. The Hagel bill does it. That is why we ought \nto be supporting it. The key issue is not whether there is any human \ninfluence effect on the globe today. Instead the issue is how large any \nhuman influence may be as it compares with natural variabilities in our \nclimate; how costly and how effective human intervention may be in \nreversing, justifying, moderating any form of variability that exists \nout there; if, in fact, we could possibly do it. What technologies may \nbe required over the near and long term is to determine all that they \nrelate to as it relates to intensity and the climate change issue \nitself.\n\n  It is an important issue for the Senate to address. I believe it has \nbeen brought to us today in the proper format, not only to drive \ntechnologies at home but to embrace other countries around the world. \nWhy in the air high over Ohio today do we find carbon not from the \nUnited States but from China? And we do. Gases, carbon-containing \ngases, high in the atmosphere over the United States today are coming \nfrom the largest burner of coal as a nation in the world. And they are \noutside Kyoto, and we don't do anything about it. The Hagel bill does. \nIt embraces them. It begins to work with them.\n  It begins to recognize that if we are going to clean up the world \nbeyond where it is today, if we did it alone, it would be but a moment \nof time. We must engage our colleagues from all over the world in a \ncomprehensive fashion that deals with technology, that causes the world \nto be relatively transparent in all that they do, for the developing \nnations of the world not to say to them, Just turn your lights out and \nstay where you are. They won't. They haven't. And now we need to work \nwith them to make sure that in our pursuit of a cleaner world, we allow \nour technology to embrace their problems along with our problems. That \nis recognized and understood by the Hagel-Pryor amendment. I am pleased \nto be a cosponsor of it.\n  I urge my colleagues in the final analysis of this debate, this is \nthe right direction to go. We ought to take it and be happy we are \nmoving in this direction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Hagel-Pryor \nclimate change amendment and to discuss the reality of global warming. \nI also thank my colleagues for some of the kind comments on the Senate \nfloor and the kind comments I have heard in the last few days just in \nthe hallways around the Senate. They have been encouraging.\n  Climate change is not a new issue to this body, to the scientific \ncommunity, or to the public at large. This issue has been discussed, \ndissected, and debated for years--with little or no action. I believe \nthis is because the complexities and uncertainties about the magnitude, \nthe timing, and the rate of climate change have led to a stalemate on \npolicy recommendations.\n  Mr. President, Senator Hagel and I, as well as the other cosponsors, \nare trying to move past this stalemate. We bring to the table a market-\ndriven, technology-based approach that will begin to address this \ncontroversial yet pressing matter.\n  Our amendment--also cosponsored by Senators Alexander, Craig, Dole, \nMurkowski, Voinovich, and Stevens--does not dump all of the \nresponsibility on industry, nor does it force a one-size-fits-all \nmandate. Over and over again, we have watched such approaches result in \nfailure on the Senate floor. We can no longer afford to do nothing.\n  The business and the environmental sectors do not have to be mutually \nexclusive. With this amendment, we treat them as partners brought \ntogether through innovation for the common and necessary good.\n  A third partner in this relationship is the Government, with \ninstitutional leverage and funding mechanisms that will help spur \nindustry to create new technologies targeted at reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions.\n  In a nutshell, we are encouraging American ingenuity, partnerships \nand, above all, progress.\n  This comprehensive climate change amendment has two main components. \nIt identifies what must be accomplished domestically and \ninternationally to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n  The domestic component of our amendment would authorize the Federal \nGovernment to make financial commitments for research and development \nand technology.\n  The Hagel-Pryor amendment authorizes direct loans, loan guarantees, \nstandby default and interest coverage\n\n[[Page S6883]]\n\nfor projects which deploy technologies that reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions.\n  Additionally, we are asking for an authorization of $2 billion over 5 \nyears in tax credits to support these technologies and to create a new \ninvestment and construction tax credit for nuclear power facilities.\n  In Little Rock, we have a small company called ThermoEnergy, which is \ndeveloping technology that eliminates most air emission from new fossil \nfuel powerplants. They use a process that increases plant efficiency \nbut also eliminates adverse environmental and health effects associated \nwith the use of fossil fuels, especially coal. I know there are many \nother companies all over this country that have great potential to \nachieve a broad range of energy security and environmental goals. They \nsimply need the resources to expand their capabilities into the \nmarketplace.\n  Under this amendment, a wide variety of greenhouse gas-reducing \ntechnologies would be eligible for tax credits or loans, ranging from \nrenewable energy products, lower emission transportation, carbon \nsequestration, coal gasification and liquefaction, and other energy \nefficiency enhancements.\n  This amendment also establishes a climate coordinating committee and \nclimate credit board to assess, approve, and fund projects; and it \ndirects the Secretary of Energy to lead an interagency process to \nimplement a national climate change strategy. While we deal with \nclimate change here in the United States, let us not forget that people \nin other parts of the world are already experiencing the effects of \nglobal warming.\n  I have heard quite a bit about the 11,000 residents of Tuvalu, who \nlive on a 10-mile square scattered over the Pacific Ocean near Fiji. \nTuvalu has no industry, burns little petroleum, and creates less carbon \npollution than a small town in America. This tiny place, nevertheless, \nis on the front line of climate change. The increasing intensity of \nweather and rising sea level could soon wash away this tiny island. \nOther low-lying countries, such as Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, are \nexperiencing similar phenomena.\n  The United States is a contributor to climate change, and we must \ntake action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but we cannot prevent \nglobal warming on our own. That is why we have included an \ninternational component to this amendment to encourage developing \ncountries to adopt U.S. technologies. In doing so, we have asked the \nSecretary of State and the U.S. Trade Representative to assume \nadditional roles.\n\n  First, we provide the Secretary of State with new authority to work \nwith developing countries on deployment and demonstration projects and \ntechnologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Second, the U.S. Trade Representative is directed to negotiate the \nremoval of trade-related barriers to the export of greenhouse gas-\nreducing technologies.\n  Furthermore, this amendment would establish an interagency working \ngroup to promote the exports of certain technologies and practices.\n  It is in the shared interests of the United States and industrialized \nnations to help other countries by sharing cleaner technology.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is not the solution for all of our \nclimate change problems. It is meant to serve as a catalyst in bringing \nthe necessary technology to the marketplace. I am hopeful that with the \nresources provided through this amendment, private industry will \nswiftly create or adopt cleaner technologies as they become available \nand move us in the right direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise for a moment to commend the \nSenator from Nebraska and the Senator from Arkansas for their \nleadership on this amendment and, in particular, for their approach. As \na freshman Member of this body, I have looked forward with anticipation \nto the great debate on the Energy bill. I know that for basically a \ndecade we have been without an energy policy and desperately in need of \none.\n  As a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and \nbecause of earlier legislation this year, I am critically aware of the \nclimate change concerns and the desires by some to establish absolute \nstandards on carbon. Senator Hagel and Senator Pryor have done \nprecisely the right thing--precisely the thing America has done over \nand over again to address problems and bring about positive solutions.\n  As Senator Pryor just outlined, there is no reason for the business \nand development community of America and the environmental community's \ninterests to be mutually exclusive. In fact, they should be mutually \ninclusive. Legislation such as this, which promotes incentives to find \nsolutions to greenhouse gases, carbon emissions, develop alternative \nenergy sources and new mechanisms of taking old sources such as coal \nand making them clean technologies, is absolutely correct.\n  I rise for one purpose, and that is to talk about a prime example of \nwhat Senators Pryor and Hagel are proposing. A number of years ago, the \nDepartment of Energy put out competition to ask private sector electric \ngeneration companies to bid on doing a demonstration project to see if \ncoal gasification was possible and through its generation electricity \ncould be produced at an economically viable and competitive rate.\n  In my neighboring State of Alabama, next to my home of Georgia, in \nWilsonville, AL, such a project took place in the Southern Company. The \nDepartment of Energy began a joint project and invested money and \ndeveloped technology that today leads to the construction of a plant in \nOrlando, FL, in conjunction with the Orlando Utility Company, where, \nthrough the new technique of coal gasification, electricity will be \ngenerated and retailed in that part of middle Florida without the \nemission of greenhouse gases.\n  That is what America is all about--positive incentives to do the \nright thing and to find solutions. This amendment by the Senators from \nNebraska and Arkansas will do just that. I rise happily to give it my \nendorsement and my support.\n  One final comment. As we talk about the need to protect our \nenvironment and ensure that greenhouse gases don't run away from us and \nthat we preserve all that we have, we have to understand that we have \nto incentivize every part of the energy sector and the energy segment, \nand as we develop new technologies, we also ought to reuse and \nreintroduce those great technologies of nuclear and others that have \nproduced clean, efficient, reliable energy without the production \neither of carbon or the greenhouse gases.\n  So I commend the Senator from Nebraska and the Senator from Arkansas \non their leadership. I support the Hagel-Pryor amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for \nhis good example and his leadership in this legislation. I especially \nsalute the Senator from Nebraska for having the unerring good judgment \nto suggest to us the right next step.\n  This Energy bill we have been debating in the last 2 weeks and \nworking on for the last several months is really a no-carbon, low-\ncarbon energy bill. Since carbon in the air is the principal \ncontributor to the worry about global climate change, this bill is the \nsolution to that problem.\n  There is still a lot of work to do, and there are a lot of minds that \nare changing, studying, assessing the science, and trying to make \ncertain we make good policy judgments here. But anyone who watches this \ndebate or reads it closely should understand that, in my view, the \nSenate is developing a clean energy bill. The Senator from Idaho said \nit was a climate change energy bill. But it represents, to me, a \nrecognition that it is time to take a more significant step toward \nputting us on a path of transforming the way we create electricity in \nthis country and use energy so that we can produce less carbon. A big \npart of that is the concern we have about what we might be doing as \nhuman beings to cause global climate change.\n  So the Senate is like a big train: it is hard to get started, but \nonce it gets going, it moves steadily down the track. We are moving \nsteadily down the track toward a completely different emphasis on the \nproduction of\n\n[[Page S6884]]\n\nelectricity and the use of energy, and the whole focus is no-carbon and \nlow-carbon.\n  Sometimes we elected officials have a way of saying things like that, \nand they just turn into little programs that don't amount to much. That \nis not the case here. This is the whole core of this piece of \nlegislation. If you are really trying to create a way to produce \nelectricity in a country that uses 25 percent of all the energy in the \nworld--and that is what we do--you have to start with conservation.\n  This legislation, the Domenici-Bingaman legislation that is before \nus, begins with provisions about efficiency, and it has in it \nprovisions that will shave off between 20 and 40 percent of the \nanticipated growth of energy demand by 2015.\n  It would save the equivalent of building 170 300-megawatt plants. So \nwe begin with conservation and we begin with efficiency.\n  No. 2, the bill--before we get to the Hagel amendment of which I am \nglad to be a cosponsor--puts a focus on the one way today that we \ncreate carbon-free electricity far and above everything else, and that \nis nuclear power. If we are worried about global warming, the solution \nis nuclear power. Nuclear power produces 70 percent of our carbon-free \nelectricity. We know how to do it, we invented it. We have never had a \nsingle reactor accident in the dozens of Navy vessels that are powered \nby nuclear reactors that we have used since the 1950s. We have shipped \nthis technology to France which now is nearly 80 percent in terms of \nsupplying its electricity from nuclear power. Japan builds new nuclear \npowerplants every year.\n  If we care about low-carbon, no-carbon electricity, after we have \naggressive conservation, we should make it easier to produce nuclear \npower, and in a variety of ways this legislation does that.\n  Waiting in the wings, if we care about low-carbon, no-carbon power, \nis an example of what the Senator from Georgia talked about. We call \nthat coal gasification with carbon sequestration. That is such a long-\nsounding title that nobody could possibly imagine what it is. But what \nit does is it simply takes this hundreds and hundreds of years' supply \nof coal that we have and turns it, by burning it, into gas, and then we \nburn the gas. That gets rid of the sulfur, the nitrogen, and the \nmercury, but it leaves the carbon.\n  The technology of carbon sequestration is to take that carbon and \nstore it in the ground or do something else with it.\n  As the Senator from Nebraska has said, if through his initiative, his \nincentive program, we are able to encourage the science and technology \ncapacity of the United States and the world to advance through \ndemonstration coal gasification, reduce its costs somewhat, and then to \nsolve the problem of carbon sequestration, that is the single best way, \nafter nuclear power, to create clean air in the world. Many in the \nenvironmental community prefer it to nuclear power because of their \nconcerns about storage of spent fuel and about proliferation.\n  So conservation, nuclear power, and coal gasification with carbon \nsequestration are the ways to solve any concerns we might have about \nglobal warming because, especially with the Hagel-Pryor provisions, we \nare able to accelerate that technology not just for ourselves but for \nthe world.\n  We also have in this legislation important support for solar power \nwhich has basically been left out of our renewable production tax \ncredit. It has not gotten any of the money--almost any of the money. \nBiomass, which is becoming more important, wind power--many of my \ncolleagues know I think we have gone overboard on wind power, but there \nare substantial generous provisions in here.\n  Add up all those renewable fuels and they are a few percent. They are \nimportant, but we have to put them in their proper perspective.\n  There is an oil savings amendment in this bill that reduces the \namount of carbon in the air. And then there is the tax title to the \nEnergy bill that we will be considering later this week which Senator \nGrassley, Senator Baucus, and their committee have produced which--with \na couple of exceptions, which I will talk about at another time--I \nthink is a great step forward. It would have to be considered a low-\ncarbon, no-carbon tax title with clean energy bonds for certified coal \nproperty, with consumer incentives for hybrid and diesel vehicles.\n  There is an amendment being discussed, of which I hope to be a part, \nthat would add incentives to retooling automobile plants so that we can \nsee that those hybrid cars and advanced diesel vehicles are built in \nthe United States and not in Yokohama.\n  There is in the tax title energy-efficient proposals to support \nenergy-efficient appliances and buildings. There is in the tax title \nsupport for investment tax credits for the coal gasification plants I \nmentioned.\n  There is in the Energy and Natural Resources bill a new financing \nprocedure that Senator Domenici has envisioned which would be loan \nguarantees for all of these forms of clean energy.\n  There is support for solar deployment, and then there is support for \nadvanced nuclear power facilities so that we can build smaller, less \nexpensive nuclear power facilities.\n  All this adds up to a clean Energy bill that puts its focus on low-\ncarbon and no-carbon electricity. What Senator Hagel has done is say \nthat is a good direction, but let's accelerate it by encouraging \ntechnology. It is not a top-down idea. It is to say to someone in \nTennessee or Minnesota who might be producing carbon in their business \nor a utility: Bring us your baseline. Tell us how much carbon you have \nbeen producing. Tell us how much less you plan to produce. Then this \nboard would create the incentives for that, and we would see where we \ngo with that.\n  There are other important steps, and we are about to debate one of \nthem. Senators McCain and Lieberman have worked hard to take us to what \nI would call the next generation or the next step, which would be \nmandatory caps on carbon.\n  I have supported one version of legislation that has a mandatory cap \non carbon. It was the bill introduced by Senator Carper last year. I \ndid it primarily because I care about clean air, and I wanted less \nsulfur, nitrogen, and mercury in the air, and it had more aggressive \nstandards than the President's proposals. But it also included a carbon \ncap and that fitted my understanding of where the technology is.\n  The more I have studied this I think the Hagel approach is the better \napproach because it fits with the low-carbon legislation which we have. \nIt accelerates it, gives it some juice. Then I like what Senator \nDomenici said last night in his statement about the discussions we have \nbeen having with Senator Bingaman about his proposal for the \npossibility of caps.\n\n  Senator Domenici said we should begin immediately, in July, holding \nhearings on the Hagel legislation and on whatever the next steps might \nbe. In other words, this is not just passing an energy bill and then \nwait 10 to 15 years and pass another one. This is recognizing we have \ncreated a completely different direction for production of energy and \nelectricity in the United States; that we are adding to it with the \nHagel amendment; that we have serious proposals from Senators McCain \nand Lieberman, and Senator Bingaman has made some. The National \nCommission on Energy Policy, many of whose suggestions are a part of \nthis bill, have made some.\n  So my hope is that Chairman Domenici and Senator Bingaman, if we \nshould adopt the Hagel amendment, will take us to the next step in July \nand August and let us see how we might implement it and where we might \ngo.\n  Speaking as one Senator, this is a significant shift of direction. I \nam not willing to go further with mandates at this point. I like the \nconcepts, but I am leery of applying such a complex, detailed set of \nmandates as some have proposed to such a big complex economy as we have \ntoday.\n  I prefer the Hagel approach. It is the right next step. It fits \neasily into this no-carbon, low-carbon Energy bill. I salute the \nSenator from Nebraska and the Senator from Arkansas for their \nleadership. I look forward to voting for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I have a \nunanimous consent request which has been cleared on both sides.\n\n[[Page S6885]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that there now be 60 minutes of debate in \nrelation to the pending amendment with the following Senators \nrecognized: Senator Voinovich, 15 minutes; Senator Reid or his \ndesignee, 15 minutes; Senator Inhofe, 15 minutes; Senator Hagel, 15 \nminutes. I further ask unanimous consent that following the use or \nyielding back of the time the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to \nthe Hagel amendment, with no second-degree amendments in order to the \namendment prior to that vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand that this is satisfactory \nwith Senator Hagel.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, it is. I thank the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I know we just set this in motion, but I \nask Senator Hagel if I could use 2 minutes of his time now.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I yield as much time as the chairman needs.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before we are finished with the votes on \nglobal warming--and I will have a little to say; I will get time from \nsomebody--I will present to the Senate a detailed summary of the bill \nthat is pending before the Senate in terms of what it does to move the \nUnited States of America toward a reduction in the so-called greenhouse \ngases led by carbon.\n  This bill we are going to vote out of here hopefully tomorrow or the \nnext day that we worked so hard on in the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources, with Senator Bingaman, my ranking member, and \nSenators such as Lamar Alexander who have worked very hard, it does \ntake some giant steps toward the reduction of carbon in the American \neconomy. It does so in ways that if our business communities want to \nspend money and use innovative technology, the opportunities are there.\n  If our scientists want to make breakthroughs to clean up, it is \nthere. If people want to move with nuclear power, which is the \ncleanest--right now, as my friend from Tennessee has reminded me, 70 \npercent of the carbon-free emissions in America come from the nuclear \npowerplants. That is rather astounding. We run around thinking we have \ndone so much cleanup, but these very old--old in that we have not built \none in 23 years--these nuclear powerplants are the ones that are \ncleaning up right now.\n  All I am saying is, this bill says if we are right, we are going to \nbuild some nuclear powerplants during the era of trying to reduce \ncarbon. That is going to be part of our world, both economic and \ncleanup world, as provided in this bill.\n  We will summarize that. There is no attempt to delude the efficacy of \nthe other bills, be it Hagel or McCain, but merely to say we recognized \nthis in our committee, but we just did not think we ought to do global \nwarming per se. That is where we are.\n  The Senate is confronted with the unanimous consent agreement which \nwe have just laid before it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask unanimous consent that time that elapses during the quorum call be \ncharged equally to all sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of the bipartisan \namendment proposed by Senators Hagel and Pryor to add a climate change \ntitle to the Energy bill. I commend them for their leadership on this \nvery important issue.\n  Man's relationship with the world's climate has long been a focus of \nscientists and policymakers. Thirty years ago, there was great concern \nabout global cooling, as evidenced by articles in Science Digest in \nFebruary, 1973, entitled ``Brace Yourself for an Ice Age'' and Time \nMagazine in June, 1974, entitled ``Another Ice Age?''\n  Today, many are worried instead about global warming, with claims \nthat urgent and dramatic actions are needed to avoid catastrophic \nimpacts. As the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Clean Air, \nClimate Change, and Nuclear Safety Subcommittee, I have spent a great \ndeal of time studying this issue, as our committee has held numerous \nhearings on climate change.\n  The chairman of the committee, Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma, has \nspent countless hours personally examining climate change science. He \nhas recently given several speeches on the Senate floor, pointing out \nserious flaws in the four principal beliefs underlying what some call a \nconsensus on global warming. His work points out very clearly that we \nare far from a consensus and many questions remain.\n  I am hopeful today he will take the floor some time to go into more \nof the details on that, as he has in the past.\n  Despite the scientific debate, the issue of global warming and \nproposals to address this perceived threat have received a lot of \nattention lately in the Senate. On one side of this debate, there are \nproposals to create a mandatory domestic program to reduce greenhouse \ngas emissions, such as the amendment that will be proposed by Senator \nMcCain, to my understanding, and I strongly urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst this amendment.\n  It is my understanding that the amendment, according to Charles \nRivers Associates, which analyzed its provisions, would cause the loss \nof 24,000 to 47,000 Ohio jobs, in 2010, and energy-intensive industries \nto shrink by 2.3 to 5.6 percent in 2020. We are talking about \nmanufacturing industries, energy-intensive manufacturing and chemical \nand many others.\n  The McCain amendment will put coal out of business by forcing fuel \nswitching to natural gas. This might even be why some organizations are \npushing this amendment. Last year, I was shocked to read that a Sierra \nLegal Defense Fund staff lawyer said:\n\n       In general, our long-term objective is to make sure that \n     coal-fired plants get closed.\n\n  This is an unacceptable outcome for my State and our Nation. Nearly \n90 percent of Ohio's electricity comes from coal. For the Nation, it is \nabout 50 percent. Companies depend on this low-cost energy to compete \nin the global marketplace. We do not live in a cocoon. Companies are \nmoving overseas because of increased health care costs, litigation \ncosts, and energy costs are also a major factor.\n  According to a recent survey of industrial executives, the No. 1 \nbarrier to U.S. manufacturing growth in the coming year is high energy \nprices. It becomes even more costly for companies to operate in this \ncountry when you consider the new air quality standards for ozone and \nparticulate matter. States and localities have yet to fully understand \nhow difficult and expensive it will be to come in compliance with the \nstandards.\n  Over the last decade, the use of natural gas in electricity \ngeneration has risen significantly, while domestic supplies of natural \ngas have fallen.\n  That is why we are trying to do something about more natural gas in \nthis Energy bill. The results are predictable: Tightening supplies of \nnatural gas, higher natural gas prices, and higher electricity prices.\n  Because of this situation, U.S. natural gas prices are the highest in \nthe developed world. Families that use natural gas to heat their homes, \nfarmers that use it to make fertilizer, and the manufacturers who use \nit as a feed stock are getting hammered due to these higher costs.\n  The chemical industry's 8-decade run as a major exporter ended in \n2003 with a $19 billion trade surplus in 1997 becoming a $9.6 billion \ndeficit.\n  So we have lost the chemical industry for all intents and purposes \nbecause of the high cost of natural gas.\n  The President of one major pharmaceutical company that employs 22,000 \npeople in the United States called me recently and said unless we do \nsomething about natural gas prices, his company will be forced to move \nmany of its operations overseas.\n  The bottom line is, if you kill coal with a mandatory cap on carbon, \nyou force more people to go to natural gas to produce electricity. We \njust add to the crisis that we already have.\n  The energy bill tries to address this crisis, but the amendment we \nare going\n\n[[Page S6886]]\n\nto be getting later on would reverse those efforts and cause an even \nworse situation than what exists today. The U.S. has a responsibility \nto develop a policy that harmonizes the needs of our economy and our \nenvironment. These are not competing needs. A sustainable environment \nis critical to a strong economy, and a sustainable economy is critical \nto providing the funding necessary to improve our environment.\n  If we kill the golden goose, we will not have the money for the \ntechnology to do the things that we need to do, to improve the \nenvironment. A carbon cap--and that is what we are going to be hearing \nmore about--means fuel switching, the end of manufacturing in my State, \nenormous burdens on the least of our brethren, and moving jobs and \nproduction overseas.\n  It is already happening. We have a $162 billion trade deficit with \nChina and almost all of it is in the manufacturing area. These are \npeople who are moving out because of the high cost of producing here in \nthe United States.\n  Ironically, a carbon cap, a cap on carbon, as I say, is going to have \na dramatic negative impact on our manufacturing. A couple of years ago, \nwhen Senator Jeffords was promoting a bill that would put a cap on \ncarbon, I said to him: Senator, those jobs that you are killing in Ohio \nare not going to Vermont. They are going to China, and they are going \nto go to India.\n  I have also discussed this issue twice with British Prime Minister \nTony Blair, who has made climate change one of the focuses of the \nupcoming G8 meeting. I think he understands that Kyoto is not working, \nand we need to do something else.\n  Furthermore, many of the countries that did ratify the Kyoto treaty \nare not expected to meet their commitments. According to a Washington \nTimes article of May 16 entitled ``Broken Promises, Hot Air,'' 12 of \nthe 15 European Union countries are currently 20 to 70 percent above \ntheir emissions target levels.\n  I think the Senator from Idaho mentioned earlier in his remarks that \nthe Italians have basically said they are not going to be able to meet \ntheir commitments that they made when they signed the Kyoto treaty.\n  So last week I became a cosponsor of three pieces of legislation that \ncomprehensively address climate change by focusing on tax incentives, \ntechnology development, and international deployment.\n  The amendment that we have proposed today contains the domestic and \ninternational proposal. It does not include the tax incentives because \nthe Energy bill now includes an amendment by the Finance Committee to \nadd over $14 billion, over 10 years, in tax incentives.\n  I will only briefly explain the amendment since it has been explained \nby colleagues. It proposes the adoption of technologies that reduce \ngreenhouse gas intensity by creating a Climate Coordinating Committee \nand Climate Credit Board to assess, approve, and fund projects. \nAddressing climate change must be accomplished through the development \nof new technologies, as there currently is no technology available to \ncapture and control carbon dioxide emissions.\n  Many people today are promoting combined gas--integrated gas combined \ncycle technology, which will reduce NOx and SOx and deal with mercury. \nThe fact of the matter is, in terms of greenhouse gases, it does not \nget the job done.\n  Second, the amendment focuses on the notion that all nations must be \npart of this effort. It directs the Department of State to work with \nthe top 25 greenhouse gas-emitting developing countries to reduce their \ngreenhouse gas intensity. It also promotes the export of greenhouse gas \nintensity reducing technologies.\n  I really think, if this amendment to the Energy bill is agreed to, it \nis something the President, when he goes to the G8 meeting, can refer \nto in terms of its importance, getting everybody at the table to start \nto do something realistic about the problem of greenhouse gases.\n  I am concerned that the very nature of this amendment is misleading; \nthat is, that we are adding a climate title to the Energy bill, which \nmeans that maybe it does not address climate change. This is not true.\n  I commend Senators Domenici and Bingaman for putting together a \nbipartisan energy bill that deals with climate change in several ways. \nIn other words, the underlying bill already deals with climate change.\n  First, the bill provides research and development funding for long-\nterm zero- or low-emitting greenhouse technologies. These include fuel \ncells, hydrogen cells, coal gasification--with the greatest potential \nto capture and control carbon dioxide emissions.\n  Second, the bill includes extensive provisions to increase energy \nconservation.\n  Third, the bill promotes the use of nuclear power, which is \nemissions-free power. There is no greenhouse gas with nuclear power.\n  I restate this for my colleagues: The Energy bill already addresses \nclimate change. For all those concerned about climate change, the \nunderlying bill deals with it. The Hagel-Pryor amendment simply adds to \nthese provisions. Let me restate this for my colleagues: This bill, \nwithout any amendments, including ours, addresses climate change.\n  Some might be further misled to think that our country is currently \nnot doing anything because the Energy bill does all of this to address \na climate change. However, this is far from the truth. In fact, our \nNation is taking so many actions on this front that I am going to try \nto run through them very quickly. In other words, we are doing an \nenormous amount in our country in terms of greenhouse gases and dealing \nwith this whole issue of carbon emissions.\n  The President established a climate change policy to reduce the \ngreenhouse gas intensity of our economy by 18 percent over the next 10 \nyears through voluntary measures. This is more than most of the \ncountries involved in the Kyoto Protocol. Unlike the rest of the world, \nwe are on target to meet our goal--not like the Europeans, 12 to 70 \npercent away from meeting their goals.\n  We have the Climate VISION Partnership which involves 12 major \nindustrial sectors and the members of the Business Roundtable who have \ncommitted to work with Cabinet agencies to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions in the next decade.\n  We have the climate leader's program, an EPA partnership encouraging \nindividual companies to develop long-term comprehensive climate change \nstrategy. Sixty-eight corporations are already participating in the \nprogram.\n  The administration's budget for 2006 is $5.5 billion for extensive \nclimate change technology and science programs and energy tax \nincentives.\n  The United States is also taking a lead internationally--and again, \nwe get no credit. There is $198 million included in the President's \nfiscal year 2006 budget for international climate change.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator is expired.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I extend the time of the Senator from Ohio \nby another 3 minutes if that would assist the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. As I mentioned, we are taking a lead internationally. \nThe United States is by far the largest funder of activities under the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Also, despite complaints to \nthe contrary, the United States remains fully engaged in multilateral \nnegotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange.\n  Announced by EPA in July of 2004, along with 13 other countries, the \nMethane-to-Markets partnership is a new and innovative program to help \npromote energy security, improve environmental quality, and reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions throughout the world.\n  The United States hosted the first Ministerial Meeting of the \nInternational Partnership for Hydrogen Economy, the Carbon \nSequestration Leadership Forum and Earth Observation Summit. We never \nhear anything about this. It is as if we are doing nothing.\n  Despite all that we are doing and all that is contained in the Energy \nbill, we can even do more by passing this amendment proposed today by \nSenators Hagel and Pryor. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against \nany amendments that contain mandatory\n\n[[Page S6887]]\n\nprograms which work against the very purpose of the Energy bill and \ncause substantial harm to our economy, its workers, and our families. \nInstead, I urge the support of this bipartisan amendment which builds \non all we are doing and will do under the Energy bill to address \nclimate change responsibly and comprehensively.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is my understanding I have 13 minutes.\n  Mr. President, first of all, let me commend Senator Hagel for the \nwork he has done and for the realistic approach he is taking. Right \nnow, there is so much misinformation out there in conjunction with the \nwhole issue of climate change.\n  Someone said the other day that climate change is not a scientific \ndiscussion, it is a religion. People have such strong feelings about it \nor they want to believe so badly. If my staff had the charts, I would \nshow a few of them, but I will wait until we are debating the McCain-\nLieberman bill to show them.\n  I vividly remember not too long ago the front page of Time magazine, \nthe front page of Science magazine, huge pictures: Another ice age is \ncoming; we are all going to die. If some people cannot be hysterical \nand think the end is coming, they are not happy.\n  One important area in this debate is to recognize, as I think the \nSenator from Idaho and the Senator from Ohio both did, that this \nPresident has done quite a bit more than science would justify in \npursuing the notion, first of all, is there a warming trend that is \noutside of natural variances; No. 2, if that is the case, is it due to \nanthropogenic gasses--methane, CO2. I suggest science does \nnot show that either is true. It is not just me saying this. I don't \nknow why people totally ignore the fact that we had the Heidelburg \naccords, when 4,000 scientists questioned that there is any major \nchange.\n  By the way, this morning's Wall Street Journal plots out the changes \nin the Earth's surface since 1000 A.D. and what has perhaps caused \nthese changes. They have come to the conclusion that it could not be \nanthropogenic gases because at that time there were not any. There were \nnot human-induced gases until about 1940.\n  In 1940, what happened? In 1940, there was a cooling period that went \nall the way to the end of the 1970s. That is when you saw all the \narticles saying the ice age is coming. The largest increase in \nanthropogenic gases came right around 1940 and following World War II. \nYou know, instead of precipitating a warming period, it precipitated a \ncooling period. So just the opposite of what they are saying seems to \nbe true.\n  We have the Heidelburg accords, 4,000 scientists say there is not a \nrelationship between manmade gases and climate change. Then we have the \nOregon Petition and 17,000 scientists coming to the same conclusion. We \nhave the Smithsonian-Harvard peer-reviewed study that evaluated \neverything done so far and came to that same conclusion.\n  Since 1999, science has been on the other side refuting the fact \nthat, No. 1, climate is changing; and No. 2, it is due to manmade gases \nor to anthropogenic gases.\n  People do not realize what this President has done. One would think \nby reading some of the magazines, publications, and watching TV that \nthis President is not doing a good job with the environment. He is \ndoing everything he can to determine if there is a relationship between \nthese anthropogenic gases and climate change. If anyone does not \nbelieve it, look at the amount of money being spent. His 2006 budget \nproposed $5.5 billion for climate change programs, energy tax \nincentives, and these types of things. I see the Hagel bill as \nextending what the President is doing right now and is actually \naddressing what is happening internationally.\n  I was very pleased to be part of the 95-to-0 vote on the Hagel-Byrd \namendment some time ago that said that if you go to Kyoto meeting, we \nshould oppose signing on to any kind of a treaty that does not treat \ndeveloping countries the same as developed nations. That is exactly \nwhat happened.\n  Now, at least in the Hagel approach, we are looking internationally. \nIt is true, what the Senator from Idaho said a few minutes ago. Over \nthe State of Ohio, if you get high up, that which is up there \noriginated in China. The pollution--not that that is pollution, because \nit is not, it is a fertilizer. But in terms of SOx, NOx, mercury, they \ndo not stop at State lines.\n  We have a President giving the benefit of the doubt to the fact there \nmight be something there. He is putting money into research. The Hagel \nbill is carrying that on to a logical conclusion.\n  Quite frankly, when the Hagel bill first came up, I was a little \nconcerned because the price tag, as I calculated it--and I would \ncertainly stand to be corrected if it is not accurate--would have been \n$4 billion over a 5-year period; around $800 million a year. To add \nthat to what is already being expended--perhaps we are talking about \ntoo much money. He has changed it and said such sums ``as necessary.'' \nThis is a little bit disturbing to me. We do not know who will be in \nthe White House. We do not know who will control Congress. We do not \nknow what will happen in the future. I hate to leave it open-ended like \nthat.\n\n  When we look at the arguments out there, we will have ample time to \ndebate when the next amendment comes up--the McCain Lieberman \namendment--that the science clearly has turned around and is in favor \nright now of refuting some of the earlier suggestions.\n  This whole thing started in 1998 when Michael Mann from Virginia came \nout with his hockey stick theory. He plotted out all the temperatures \nand came through the 20th century. Temperatures started going up as of \nlate on the hockey stick. What he neglected to realize, prior to that \ntime, the medieval warming period, which was around 1000 to 1300 A.D., \nthe temperatures were actually higher at that time than they were in \nthe 20th century.\n  All these things are going to be discussed in the next amendment. I \nbelieve that reason is prevailing in this approach. I applaud the \nSenator from Nebraska for coming up with something measured and \nreasonable that will help convince a lot of the people that are right \nnow participating in this religion called global warming to realize \nmaybe this is something for which we shouldn't have to suffer \neconomically.\n  A lot of people have asked the question, If the science is not there \nand if we know as a result of the Wharton Econometric Survey that it \nwill cause a dramatic increase in the cost of energy--it will cost each \naverage family of four $2,700 a year--if the science is not there, what \nis the motivation? I suggest there are people outside of the United \nStates who would love to see us become partners and sign on to the \nKyoto treaty.\n  Jacques Chirac said global warming is not about climate change but \nfor leveling the playing field for big business worldwide. The same \nthing was stated by Margot Wallstrom, the Environmental Minister for \nthe European Union, that it is leveling that playing field.\n  Cooler heads are prevailing, and in this amendment we have a chance \nto look at this, study this as time goes by, and take whatever actions \nare necessary in the future but not react to fictitious science and to \nscience that just flat is not there.\n  I applaud the Senator from Nebraska for the fine work he has done. I \nbelieve this will be a good approach to making this through the current \ndebate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President; is there a quorum \ncall?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, there is not.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Further parliamentary inquiry; what is the regular \norder at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is divided between three speakers on \nthe Hagel amendment, and each have time remaining. Senator Inhofe has 1 \nminute, Senator Hagel has 6 minutes, and Senator Reid or his designee \nhas 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Further parliamentary inquiry: Is there any other time \non behalf of any other Senators on either side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, there is not.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might I ask, when those are finished, what is the \nregular order after that?\n\n[[Page S6888]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will then vote on the Hagel \namendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered on \nthe Hagel amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, they have not.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask the Senator, would you like to get the yeas and \nnays on your amendment?\n  Mr. HAGEL. I say to the chairman, I am waiting for one additional \nsponsor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We can get the yeas and nays now?\n  Mr. HAGEL. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes. I ask \nunanimous consent that I be permitted to speak for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from New Mexico is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have a very detailed analysis I would \nlike put in the Record which relates to provisions within the Bingaman-\nDomenici bill that is before the Senate which would promote responsible \nprogress on climate change.\n  What I tried to do here was to say to the Senate: Please understand \nthat your Energy and Natural Resources Committee, from the inception, \nwas worried about climate change and the gases that have an impact on \nclimate change according to scientists in the United States. Now, there \nare some who contest that, but let me just follow through.\n  The bill before us might even have been called the Clean Energy Act \nbecause so much of it is directed at producing, in the future, for \nthese United States, energy that will have little or no effect in terms \nof emitting carbon that is the principal problem with global warming. \nHaving said that, the statement goes into detail. Indeed, it is a \ndetailed statement.\n  So I would, just for summary, say there is an entire title which we \nchose to call Incentives For Innovative Technology, title XIV of the \nbill. This is a very different section than you find in most \ntechnology-promoting or science-promoting bills because it says this \nentire provision is aimed at new technologies that will produce energy \nsources that have no global warming emissions.\n  Then it says, in order to do that, the Secretary of Energy--we put \nall this in the Energy Department so there is no mixup as to who is \ndoing what--it allows so-called guaranteed loans to be issued for the \npurpose of building clean energy-producing plants, mechanisms, or \nactivities. It says the Secretary shall analyze them. If they are \nfeasible, he can use whatever peer review he would like.\n  Then they ask of the Congressional Budget Office: How much should \nthis loan require by way of insurance, insurance for the risk? If they \nsay 10 percent, then the company asking for the money to build the new \ntechnology, which will produce clean energy, has to put up 10 percent \nof the cost in cash. And then we lend them the money, on an 80-20 \nbasis, and they proceed, under the direction of the Secretary, to \nproduce this new facility.\n  We believe this is going to say to our Federal Government for the \nfirst time: Take a look out there and see what we can do in the next \ndecade to move new technology along that will take the carbon out of \ncoal, perhaps even move with the very first generation of pilot \nprojects for the sequestration of coal and of carbon--meaning get rid \nof it, putting it in the ground or whatever. At the same time, who \nknows, that technology may take the mercury and other pollutants out of \nit.\n  But we are going to put in place an opportunity for the Secretary to \ndo this so long as he thinks they are moving in the right direction. \nAnd the right direction is the same direction as the technology-laden \nproposal by Senator Hagel.\n  We also have in this bill expanded research and development for \nbioenergy which concentrates on solar. We expanded R for nuclear \npower. Now, for anybody interested in that, that is completely \ndifferent than the incentives to build nuclear powerplants soon. This \nis research and development in what we call Generation IV. It is the \nnext, next generation of nuclear powerplants. And we start moving on \nthat. Why? Because there is a lot of money and a lot of hope that we \nwill be moving toward a hydrogen economy. I am not predicting that will \nbe the case but many are.\n  In any event, it is sufficiently important. The President moved in \nthat direction. This bill and the appropriators have spent money in \nthat way. And what we are saying in this bill is that we should spend \nmoney for the next-two-generations-out nuclear powerplants because that \nkind of powerplant may be the source of heat that will produce \nhydrogen.\n  At this point hydrogen must be produced. But the other day Senator \nBingaman and I were on a television show and somebody asked: How are we \ngoing to produce hydrogen? My friend from New Mexico said right now we \ncould produce it from natural gas. I had forgotten about that. That is \ntrue. But natural gas is in short supply, and it takes a lot of it to \nproduce hydrogen. So we need another source. That R for a new \ngeneration of powerplants is aiming in the same direction as everything \nI have spoken of. It is seeking a way to get away from carbon-laden \nenergy and move with more hydrogen potential.\n  This bill has an 8 billion gallon renewable fuel standard, which \nmeans ethanol. Many people around here and some in the country have \nsaid ethanol isn't any good. We should not be doing it. Maybe when the \nprice of crude oil was $8 or $7--I can remember when Senator Henry \nBellmon from Oklahoma was here, it was $6. He used to say the \narithmetic doesn't work. At $6 it is not worth producing ethanol. But \nat the price now, it is worth it. I don't know if eight is the right \nnumber, but we did that here because we said if we can produce ethanol, \nwe will have had a dramatic effect on the prospect of contributing more \ncarbon, which is what Senator Hagel is trying to do in his technology-\npushing amendment, is to produce less carbon, thus less pressure on \nwhat many believe is the human contributor to global warming. There is \nanother one that is in this bill. Senator Hagel doesn't have to have \nethanol in his bill because ethanol is in this bill.\n  We also require alternative fuel use, dual fuel in all Federal \nvehicles. We have reforms for alternative fuel programs. We have some \nincentives for hybrid cars. On the nuclear side, we all think that new \nnuclear powerplants is one of the best ways to address the issue of \ncarbon in the atmosphere and global warming. I think my friend from \nNebraska would agree. Right now in America 70 percent of the carbon-\nclean smokestack gases, 70 percent that is totally free of carbon comes \nfrom nuclear powerplants. So the underlying bill says: Let's build some \nnuclear powerplants. And it does everything possible, extending Price \nAnderson. So I would assume that if you had a tax-promoting bill that \ndidn't have this underlying bill that we produced in our committee, say \nit was a standalone Hagel bill, he might even put Price Anderson in \nthere because in a sense it would surely be moving the technology ahead \nby providing some of the security necessary for nuclear power.\n  Beyond that, we have changes in the geothermal leasing to get more \ngeothermal. Everywhere we turn in the bill we have produced we have \nmoved in the direction of trying to produce carbon-free energy for the \nfuture.\n  As I understand it, the distinguished Senator from Nebraska and his \nsponsors want to move in that direction with loan guarantees and other \nkinds of consortia arrangements to move ahead with technology. They \nhave an international feature to their bill. Obviously, we don't have \nan international feature to our bill, but Senator Hagel has chosen to \nput some provisions in that would move us in the right direction if \nthey can become law. It says that the world has a problem, not just \nAmerica, and that the international community, with America as part of \nit, ought to do some things to move ahead with global warming \ncontributors that will come from outside the United States, which is a \nvery good idea.\n  I ask that my full analysis of the bill before us, before the Hagel \namendment, which will be amplified if the Hagel\n\n[[Page S6889]]\n\namendment is agreed to--this statement shows everything we are doing in \nthis bill to contribute to cleaner energy sources for the future in \nterms of our electricity production which will greatly minimize carbon \nproduction--I ask unanimous consent that summary be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            The Senate Energy Bill Addresses Climate Change\n\n       Support for the provisions in the energy bill passed by the \n     Senate Energy Committee would promote responsible progress on \n     climate change.\n\n\n                               HIGHLIGHTS\n\n       The Bingaman RPS floor amendment that requires at least 10% \n     of electricity in 2020 to be generated from low-emission \n     renewable sources, such as solar, wind, geothermal and \n     biomass.

Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has 6 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, let me summarize the Hagel-Pryor climate \nchange amendment. This amendment offers a comprehensive voluntary \napproach to addressing the issue of climate change by connecting \ndomestic and international economic, environmental, and energy \npolicies. It takes a market-driven, technology-based approach to \nclimate change by using public-private partnerships to meld together \nthe institutional leverage of the Government with the innovation of \nindustry.\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent that all time be yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n817.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I hope the Senator from Colorado, Mr. \nSalazar, will find his way to the Senate Chamber because he asked us to \nget him some time, and we are doing that right now in this request.\n  The suggestion I have for the Senate is as follows: I understand \nSenator Salazar from Colorado would like to speak for 3 minutes as in \nmorning business about a deceased general in his State. Then Senator \nMcCain will offer a climate change amendment along with his cosponsor, \nSenator Lieberman. That will be debated tonight, and we will set some \nadditional\n\n[[Page S6892]]\n\ndebate time for tomorrow if required by the distinguished Senators or \nanybody in opposition.\n  We may, however, have an additional vote tonight. I want everybody to \nknow this. We might have a vote tonight. It will not be on the McCain \namendment, but we will set that amendment aside, without objection from \nthe Senator from Arizona, and take up this other amendment.\n  We have a number of amendments that are pending, besides the one I \njust indicated. One of those is a DeWine-Kohl amendment. We are going \nto try to work that in here and that would be without a rollcall vote. \nThe Voinovich amendment is the one on which we will be voting.\n  We will proceed, as I have indicated, and recognize the Senator from \nColorado, if he is here. If he is not here, we are going right to \nSenator McCain. If he comes, maybe the Senator from Arizona can \naccommodate Senator Salazar. If not, we will let Senator McCain \nproceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, may I ask unanimous consent to speak for \n30 seconds as in morning business while we are waiting?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are not waiting. Senator McCain is yielding time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues from New Mexico \nand Arizona. I thank my colleague from New Mexico for moving this \nEnergy bill forward and making such progress.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Landrieu and Ms. Stabenow are printed in today's \nRecord under ``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 826\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk on behalf \nof myself and Senator Lieberman. I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be set aside, and the amendment on behalf of myself and \nSenator Lieberman be considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is set aside. \nThe clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself and Mr. \n     Lieberman, proposes an amendment numbered 826.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first I would like to congratulate the \nsponsors of the amendment that was just passed. They did a good job on \nthe amendment. I appreciate it because it is very indicative of where \nthis debate has gone.\n  My dear friend from Connecticut and I, last October of 2003, forced a \nvote--or we had a vote on, basically, this issue, although we have \nchanged this somewhat with the inclusion of the incentives for \ntechnological advances, as well as some nuclear power provisions which \nhave proven somewhat controversial with some of our environmental \nfriends.\n  At that time the debate on the amendment was: there is no such thing, \nit is a myth, this simply bears no relation to reality--on and on. \nThere were some fascinating statements made about what a myth climate \nchange was.\n  Now, obviously, we have, by passage of the Hagel amendment, \nrecognized--at least by a majority of the Senate--that climate change \nis real and action needs to be taken. So I believe we have made \nsignificant progress since October 2003. At the same time, I have \nnoticed on other reform issues that I have been involved in over the \nyears, once the opponents of reform see reality, then they try to put \nup some kind of legislation which appears to address the issue but \nactually does not. Unfortunately, the amendment by my good friend from \nNebraska that was just approved by the Senate simply has no bearing on \nthe requirement that we act.\n  The Senator from Connecticut and I are going to present, not our \nopinions but evidence, scientific evidence, that climate change is \nreal, it is happening, and as we speak we will see things happening to \nour environment which will have long-term devastating effects on this \nglobe on which we reside. When we talk about scientific evidence and \nopinion, with the exception of those who may somehow be financially \nrelated to certain opponents of this legislation, there is very little \ndoubt as to the scientific evidence of every objective observer, not to \nmention our European friends who have so concluded and are acting to \nreduce the effects of greenhouse gas emissions in the world.\n  By the way, they have not faced Armageddon to their economies, as \npredicted by some of the speakers who have already addressed this \nissue. I found them entertaining. Do you know why I found them \nentertaining? Because every time I have been in a reform issue--whether \nit be installation of safety belts in automobiles, or airbags, or \ncampaign finance reform--the Apocalypse was upon us.\n  In this amendment we encourage technology in order to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions and make energy use more efficient, and we are \ntrying at the expense of some support to recognize that nuclear power \nis a very important contributor to our energy needs in the coming \nyears, particularly since 20 percent of our energy supply is already \nsupplied by nuclear power and those powerplants are going out of \nbusiness fairly soon. We have a proposal that is balanced and fair and \nnot only tries to minimize and, over time, reduce the damage that has \nalready been inflicted by greenhouse gas emissions, but also will \nprovide for energy that this world--our country as well as others--\nneeds.\n  Is this Kyoto that Senator Lieberman and I are proposing? No. \nSometimes I wish that it were, but it is not. It is far less stringent \nin its requirements to address the issue of greenhouse gas emissions. \nIt is something that we believe is not only affordable but doable.\n\n  Does it involve some sacrifice on the part of the American people? \nYes. I have to tell you, every time I talk to young Americans and say, \nAre you willing to make some sacrifice to prevent the occurrences that \nwe see are happening now, these young Americans are more than willing \nto do so.\n  When we talk about jobs, these Draconian estimates of lost jobs that \nthey have hired some think tank to come up with, what about the jobs \nand the economic effect on the United States of America that is already \ntaking place when we have four hurricanes in one season in Florida; \nwhen we have greater and more extreme climatic effects generated by \ngreenhouse gas emissions? How much is it going to cost when the great \nbarrier reef dies? The Australian Government has said that the great \nbarrier reef will die by--I think the year is 2040. What happens then \nto the food chain? What is the cost then?\n  What is the cost to the Alaskan Inuit Tribe when, as we speak, their \nvillages are falling into the ocean because of the melting of the \npermafrost? What are those costs?\n  I will tell you what they are; they are astronomical. They may hire a \nlot of people, in the form of emergency workers and FEMA and all of \nthat.\n  I have a very long statement. I am not going to take too long because \nI want my friend, Senator Lieberman, to talk. But why is it that our \nbest partner in Europe, Tony Blair, is so dedicated to the proposition \nthat we need to act on this issue? I do not find him to be an \nirrational individual. What does Prime Minister Tony Blair say? I think \nhe puts it better than anyone.\n  The opponents, particularly my friend from Oklahoma, will come down \nand say all this climate change is just a myth, the Earth is not \nwarmer, there is no real basis for this whatsoever. And he will find \nsome obscure scientist who will say, yes, it is a myth--despite the \noverwhelming body of evidence that dictates that climate change is real \nand its effects are already being felt in a variety of ways.\n  Suppose the Senator from Connecticut and I, and the overwhelming body \nof scientific evidence, and Tony Blair, and all the Europeans, and all \nthe signatories to the Kyoto treaty, they are all wrong and we went \nahead and made these modest proposals. What would we have? We would \nhave a cleaner Earth. We would have an Earth with a less polluted \natmosphere. We\n\n[[Page S6893]]\n\nwould have cleaner technologies. We would have found a way to again \nutilize nuclear power in a safe and efficient fashion.\n  But suppose that we are right. Let's suppose the National Academy of \nSciences is right when they say:\n\n       There will always be uncertainty in understanding a system \n     as complex as the world's climate, however there is now \n     strong evidence that significant global warming is occurring.\n\n  This comes from the National Academy of Sciences, the National \nAcademies from the G8 countries along with those from Brazil, China, \nand India.\n\n       The scientific understanding of climate change is now \n     sufficiently clear to justify nations taking prompt action. \n     It is vital that all nations identify cost-effective steps \n     that they can take now to contribute to substantial and long-\n     term reduction in net global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n  Remember, this is from the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, \nNational Academies from other G8 countries along with other countries:\n\n       We urge all nations to take prompt action to reduce the \n     causes of climate change, adapt to its impact, and ensure \n     that the issue is included in all relevant national and \n     international strategies.\n\n  Suppose they are right. Suppose they are right and we, as stewards of \nour environment, have failed to act. The consequences are clear. The \neffects are devastating. They are extremely difficult to reverse, as \nany scientist will tell you. And we will have done such a terrible \nthing to future generations not only in America but in the world \nbecause of our enormous contributions to the greenhouse gas emissions \nwhich are causing such devastating effects already as we speak.\n  I am going to yield to my friend from Connecticut. But I hope my \ncolleagues make no mistake about what we just did, which is nothing--\nwhich is nothing. There is nothing in the last amendment that has any \nrequirements whatsoever--except perhaps some more reporting. I believe \nthe time for reports is past. I think we have a sufficient number of \nreports and assessments. It has done nothing.\n  This amendment, I am sure, will be attacked--thousands of jobs will \nbe lost, we will find some obscure scientist, some will talk about the \ndangers of encouraging the use of nuclear power. The fact is, we are \ngoing to win on this issue. The reason we are going to win is because \nevery single month there is another manifestation of the terrible \neffects of what climate change is doing to our Earth. The problem is \nhow late will it be when we win? How devastating will be the effects of \nclimate change on this Earth on which we live? I am very much afraid \nthat every day that goes by our challenge becomes greater and greater.\n  That is what this debate is all about. I know the chances of our \npassing this amendment are probably not as good as we would like. But I \nhope my colleagues and the American people will pay attention to this \ndebate because it may be the most important single issue that is \naddressed by this Senate in all the time that I have been here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Arizona with \nwhom I am proud, once again, to sponsor the Climate Stewardship and \nInnovation Act to combat global warming.\n  Senator McCain has, as is his characteristic mode of behavior, talked \nstraight. He has sounded a clarion call. He has spoken in words that I \nwould echo right now: This is the challenge of our generation, \nenvironmentally. It will begin to affect the way we live on planet \nEarth.\n  We feel so strongly about it that we are going to stick together, and \nI believe our ranks will grow over time, I hope before the worst \neffects of global warming occur, before the most cataclysmic effects \noccur.\n  We are going to get this done because it has to be done. This \namendment we are offering is the only proposal the Senate will consider \nthat will actually put a halt to the rise in carbon emissions that \ncause global warming. It will also spur technological innovations to \ndeal with that problem.\n  In some sense, as I view this--and I have spent a lot of time working \non it--what is involved is a conflict between science and the \nresistance to change. Change is frightening sometimes, particularly \nwhen the worst consequences of not changing are not apparent. This is \nwhy this is such a great challenge to our political system because, \nalthough we are beginning to see the effects of global warming, the \nworst effects are over the horizon.\n  The challenge now, having been put on notice by science, is whether \nthe political leadership of our country will take the steps necessary \nto protect the generations that will follow from the worst consequences \nof global warming.\n  I will paraphrase Jonas Salk, who invented the polio vaccine: One of \nthe tests of every generation is whether we have been good ancestors, \nwhether we have acted in a way that those who follow us will say that \nwe had farsighted ancestors who saw this problem coming and dealt with \nit.\n  That is the challenge this amendment offers. Because it is about \nscience. With the distinguished Presiding Officer, particularly, I \ncannot resist going into a bit of history. It was 100 years ago this \nmonth, June 30, 1905, that Albert Einstein finished a paper with the \nvery dense title ``On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies.'' Today we \nknow it better as the Theory of Special Relativity or E equals MC \nsquared.\n  Why do I bring this up in the context of global warming? Because when \nEinstein first proposed the theory, it was dismissed as unrealistic, as \na dream. Its consequences were widely misunderstood. Over time, the \nbest scientists agreed not only that Einstein's theory was true, but \nthey expanded upon it and used it to the extraordinary benefit of the \ngenerations that have followed.\n  With apologies to another great scientist, Darwin, this process might \nbe called the ``Evolution of Theory.'' The theory that the Earth is \nwarming with dire consequences may have started off with little \nunderstanding or acceptance. In fact, when we first began to talk about \nit, Senator McCain and I, a lot of people including in this Senate \ndiscussed it as if it had a Chicken Little ``sky is falling'' quality. \nThe fact is, we were basing our actions and our arguments on \ntemperatures that were rising. But the worst effects that we were \nprojecting were based on scientific modeling.\n  Now the best scientific minds in the world have examined the evidence \nand stated that climate change is real. Its cost to our economies will \nbe devastatingly real. Its costs to our people and the way they live \nwill be devastatingly real if we do not act.\n  Just a few months ago, the head of the International Panel on Climate \nChange, Dr. Pachauri, whose candidacy for that position that was \nsupported by the Bush administration, said:\n\n       We are already at a dangerous point when it comes to global \n     warming. Immediate and very deep cuts in greenhouse gases are \n     needed if humanity, as we know it, is to survive.\n\n  The truth is, at this point, we do not need the scientists to tell us \nthat the globe is warming. We can see it with our own eyes. The most \ncompelling evidence is the satellite photographs of the polar ice caps. \nLook back 10, 15, 20 years; they are shrinking before our eyes.\n  Consider this very real example that is a consequence of that \nwarming: 184 Alaskan coastal villages already are facing the threat of \nrelocation because their land and infrastructure are being impacted by \nadvancing seas and warmer temperatures that are melting the permafrost. \nOne estimate I have seen says it will cost $100 million to locate just \none of those villages or towns. I hesitate to articulate this fear, but \nwhat would be the price if we needed to relocate New Orleans or Miami \nor Santa Cruz, CA?\n  One of North America's leading reinsurers, Swiss Re, projects that \nclimate-driven disasters could cost global financial centers more than \n$150 billion per year within the next 10 years. That is not Senator \nMcCain or me or some environmental group. It is a business, an \ninsurance company, which is on the line for the costs of climate-driven \ndisasters: $150 billion a year within the next 10 years.\n  I could go on with stories of wildlife appearing in places where they \nhave never appeared before. Even in Connecticut, we have certain birds \nthat are lingering longer in our State, because it is staying warmer \nlonger. In Maine, our colleagues say the sugar maples are being \naffected by the alteration in the climate.\n\n[[Page S6894]]\n\n  What is the United States doing? The United States, the largest \nemitter, the largest source of the greenhouse gases that cause global \nwarming, what are we doing? Nothing. Literally nothing. In some sense, \nless than nothing because we pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol that \nsubsequently has been ratified by enough of the industrialized world.\n  I agree with Senator McCain about the preceding amendment. It is a \nfig leaf. It may allow some people to say we are doing something about \nglobal warming but it does not do anything. It leaves it all to \nvoluntary action to support some research. It asks for reports. This \ngoes back to the early 1990s, when the first President Bush was very \nactively involved in the Rio conference on global warming and \nrecognized the reality of global warming, supported measures to deal \nwith it, and set voluntary standards. They did not work. That is why \nKyoto came along in 1997.\n\n  We saw, in the intervening years, if you leave it just plain \nvoluntary, nothing will happen. People will continue to do things as \nbefore. Sources of greenhouse gases will not change. We have to show \nsome leadership.\n  The last amendment I call ``fiddling while the Earth is warming.'' In \nits way, it is more consequential than Rome burning.\n  The Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act, which Senator McCain and \nI introduced as an amendment to this Energy bill, is the needed first \nstep, second step, and third step. It is the only proposal that will \ncome before the Senate that puts an absolute stop to the increase in \ngreenhouse gas emissions by America. In that sense, it brings us back \nto some point of moral responsibility. This is a problem for the whole \nglobe. We are the biggest source of it. Yet we are doing nothing about \nit, while a lot of other countries are.\n  This amendment is the only proposal that will come before the Senate \nthat creates not old-fashioned command and control but a true market \nmechanism reflecting the punishing social and economic costs of global \nwarming. And this amendment, the Climate Stewardship and Innovation \nAct, is the only proposal that will come before the Senate that \nharnesses these market forces and steers them toward new energy \ntechnology that will not only help us meet the standards but will \nenergize our economy because it will create jobs; those jobs will \ncreate products that will fill a growing global demand for energy-\nefficient greenhouse gas-resistant technologies.\n  Let me briefly state the basics of our bill. The original Climate \nStewardship Act was the result itself of a lengthy process Senator \nMcCain and I were involved in, with the stakeholders, sources of \ngreenhouse gases, environmentalists, and scientists working together. A \nmajor role was played by the Pew Trust. The original Climate \nStewardship Act asked the American people, businesses, to reduce our \ncarbon emissions to 2000 levels by the end of the decade--by 2012--\neasier to achieve than what Kyoto asked. Kyoto asked to go back to \n1990.\n  There was a graph in one of the papers yesterday that shows \nreductions from Kyoto about here; if we do nothing, about there; \nMcCain-Lieberman was in between. It is always nice to be in the \nmiddle--the golden mean. That is exactly what this proposal is. Our \nproposal then, and now, will reduce carbon emissions by use of the \nmarket, by putting a price on those emissions, with a cap and trade \npolicy modeled on the one used so successfully in the Clean Air Act of \n1990 which, as we all know, has reduced acid rain at far less cost than \nexpected without the old ``command and control'' Government.\n  Simply put, a business that does not reach its emissions target can \nbuy emissions credits from an entity who has managed to move themselves \nunder the target.\n  Because the cap and trade system creates a market price for \ngreenhouse gas emissions, it exposes the true cost of burning fossil \nfuels and will drive investments toward lower carbon-emitting \ntechnologies. It will, incidentally, also help us break our dangerous \ndependence on foreign oil which now is approaching $60 a barrel and \nrising. I fear, as so many others do, no matter how strong we are \nmilitarily, it can ultimately compromise our national security.\n  As the new title of this amendment implies, we have added an \ninnovation section to our original bill because technological change \nand innovation are the keys in both the fight against global warming \nand the battle for energy independence. Our amendment creates a \ndedicated public sector fund for ensuring that investment is directed \nat the new technologies we need, including, but not limited to, \nbiofuels, clean coal technology, solar and nuclear power, to name just \na few off an open-ended menu of climate-friendly technology choices.\n  Instead of turning to the taxpayer to fund these, our bill uses a \nvery creative self-funding mechanism. It empowers the Secretary of \nEnergy to use some of the money generated through the purchase of \nemissions credits, funneled through a new public corporation our bill \nwould create to help bring those innovations to market. The amendment \nwill ensure the most important and efficient technological alternatives \nare supported. We did not pick winners and losers. That is for the \nmarket to do. Our bill does make sure, however, that if there are \nbarriers to developing or using these new technologies to meet the \nstandards and cap in our proposal, the resources are available to knock \nthose barriers down.\n  If we do not help bring these new low carbon or zero carbon \ntechnologies to market, believe me, we will be buying them from the \nnations that do. Here is exhibit A to prove that point: Hybrid cars \ntoday are popular. There are waiting lists for them. I heard there is a \nmarket where people sell the ticket they have in the line so somebody \ncan buy a hybrid car, low-emitting vehicles that consumers have clearly \nshown they want.\n  Where did American companies get the technology to build those \nhybrids? They have licensed it from Japan. Our bill will ensure that \nassistance is provided to American manufacturers to help with the \ntransition to new technologies and energy productions with programs to \nreduce consumer costs and help dislocated workers and communities. The \npoint is, we want what we know will be an enormous market for low \ncarbon, zero carbon, low/zero greenhouse gas-emitting products to be \nfilled by products made in the United States.\n  When Senator McCain and I sat down to write this bill, we knew it had \nto pass three tests: First, it had to guarantee that it would achieve a \nreal reduction in total greenhouse gas emissions across our society. \nSecond, it had to create a true wide-open market for emissions \nreductions. And third, it had to provide businesses, and ultimately \nconsumers, with a wide range of low-emission, low-cost energy choices \nthrough technological innovations.\n  I am proud to say to my colleagues our amendment meets all three of \nthose tests.\n  The Senate should scrutinize any alternatives that are offered to \nthis amendment we have proposed and ask whether those meet those same \ntests, whether, as the planet is warming and the rest of the world is \ntrying to do something about it, the United States is fiddling.\n  I mentioned at the outset that 100 years ago this month that young \nman sitting in a Swiss patent office changed our understanding of the \nuniverse with the power of his new ideas.\n  A century later, we are facing a real threat. To meet it, we need to \nempower our best minds to use the power of new ideas to help provide \nnew sources of power to our world. If we do not take these simple steps \nnow, steps that are well within both our technological and financial \nreach, the generations that come will rightfully look back at us with \nscorn and ask why we acted so selfishly, why we yielded to the status \nquo that did not want to change, why we cared only for short-term \ncomforts or profits, and why we left them a global environment in \ndanger.\n  Einstein once said:\n\n       The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the \n     same level of thinking with which we created them.\n\n  Senator McCain and I and our other cosponsors and supporters believe \nthe Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act will not only set standards \nfor reducing global warming but will lead us to the new thinking, to \nthe new ideas, and the new products we need to halt global warming, \nachieve energy independence and protect the world as we know it and \nlove it for the generations to come.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S6895]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to say thank you to both \nSenator Lieberman and Senator McCain for giving this Senate the first \nreal start to reduce global warming. I was one who voted for the Hagel \namendment, but I did so realizing it really had very little bang for \nthe buck. This is the first real global warming bill this body will \ncome to grips with. I think it is extraordinarily important.\n  In real terms, passage of this bill would mean that instead of having \n8 billion tons of greenhouse gases emitted into the air in 2010, as \nwould be the case if we do not pass the amendment, we will emit \nslightly less than 6 billion tons in 2010. That means this amendment \nwould reduce emissions by almost 2 billion tons, or 25 percent, by the \nend of the decade.\n  In order to achieve the goal, the amendment would implement a market-\nbased emissions cap and trade system. Currently, the United States is \nthe largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world. We account for \none-fourth of all global greenhouse gas emissions.\n  In a single year, the average American produces the same greenhouse \ngas emissions as 4.5 people in Mexico or 18 people in India or 99 \npeople in Bangladesh.\n  In the past 200 years, since the Industrial Revolution, the \nconcentration of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere has risen by \nroughly 30 percent. If we do nothing to reduce these emissions, CO2 \nlevels are estimated to again rise by 30 percent in only the next 50 \nyears.\n  Here it is on the chart. You see, as temperature rises, global \nwarming takes place, and carbon dioxide emissions increase.\n  The hottest year on record is 1998, followed by a tie for the second \nhottest year between 2002 and 2003.\n  Let me say what the National Academy of Sciences has reported. Let me \njust briefly quote:\n\n       Since the 1900s global average temperature and atmospheric \n     carbon dioxide concentration have increased dramatically, \n     particularly compared to their levels in the 900 preceding \n     years.\n\n  Carbon dioxide is the No. 1 global warming gas. We have already begun \nto see, as both Senators McCain and Lieberman have said, the real \nimpacts of global warming.\n  Glaciers are beginning to disappear throughout the United States and \naround the world at a rapid rate. This chart demonstrates the rapid \nloss of the South Cascade Glaciers in Washington State. In addition, it \nis predicted that all the glaciers in Glacier National Park in Montana \nwill be gone by 2030.\n  Here on the chart, you can see the South Glacier. In 1928, you could \nsee the full glacier. Then, this is what you saw in 1979. And you can \nsee that in 2003 it was just about one-half of what it was.\n  Since 1979, more than 20 percent of the polar ice cap has melted away \ndue to the increase of global temperatures. Senator Lieberman mentioned \nthat in his speech, but I think this chart shows it dramatically. This \nline indicates the Arctic sea ice boundary in 1979. You can see how \nlarge it was. And you see more than 20 percent of the polar ice cap has \nalready melted away. That is disastrous because the top of the planet \nis more impacted than the bottom of the planet.\n  Now, this is forcing Eskimos in Alaska to move inland. My husband \njust visited an Eskimo village. They were preparing to move their \nvillage because it was being inundated by the ocean.\n  Over the last century, the global sea level has risen by 6 inches. \nThe United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts \nthat by the next century, the global sea level will rise even higher to \nanywhere from 4 inches to 3 feet. That is enormous when you look at \nthese changes.\n\n  Let me just speak for a moment about my State.\n  Since 1900, California has warmed by 2 degrees Fahrenheit. Annual \nprecipitation has decreased over much of the State--by 10 to 25 percent \nin many areas. The EPA estimates that the temperature in California \ncould rise by as much as 5 degrees by the end of this century if the \ncurrent global warming trends continue.\n  That increase is going to have a drastic impact on many facets of \nCalifornia life--water, for one. As the largest agricultural State in \nthe Union, we need it to farm and grow our crops. We need water to keep \nthe ecosystem in balance, and we need water for 37.5 million people to \ndrink, to wash, and to water crops and plants.\n  The Sierra Nevada snowpack is the largest source of water. The \nsnowpack equals about half the storage capacity of all of California's \nman-made reservoirs. It is estimated that by the end of the century, \nthe shrinking of the snowpack will eliminate the water source for 16 \nmillion people. That is equal to all of the people in the Los Angeles \nBasin. That is how big this is.\n  What this chart shows is, if we take strong action to curb greenhouse \ngas emissions, 27 percent of the snowpack will remain in the Sierras; \nstrong action will only protect 27 percent. If we do nothing to reduce \nour greenhouse gas emissions, only 11 percent of the Sierra Nevada \nsnowpack will be left by the end of the century. You clearly see it. \nThat is Armageddon for California. That is Armageddon for the fifth \nlargest economy on Earth.\n  Now, we have already begun to see a decline in the Sierra Nevada \nsnowpack due to warmer winter storms that bring more rain than snow and \nalso cause a premature melting of the snowpack.\n  If just a third of the snowpack is lost, it would mean losing enough \nwater to serve 8 million households. So you can see how big this is. \nThat is why this bill is so important--the first bill that actually \ndoes something about it.\n  Let me talk for just a second about our wine industry. It is \nrecognized throughout the world. It is a $45 billion industry in sales, \njobs, tourism, and tax revenue.\n  Grown throughout the State, wine grapes are sensitive to temperature \nand moisture. It is predicted that by the end of the century, grapes \nwill ripen up to 2 months earlier and will be of poorer quality. The \nresult is a decline for California's premier wine industry.\n  Let me talk about dairy. We are the largest dairy-producing State in \nthe Union, much to the chagrin of my distinguished colleague from \nWisconsin. Studies indicate that due to increased temperatures, our \nmilk production could be reduced anywhere from 5 to 20 percent. This \nwould not only have a drastic impact on California's agriculture \nindustry, but it would also affect other States that rely on California \nto provide milk and other dairy products.\n  Beaches and coastlines--we are known for them. When most people think \nof California, they think about our beaches. The rising sea level, due \nto global warming, is slowly swallowing these beaches and eroding the \ncoastline. Over the last century, the sea level has risen 3 to 8 \ninches. Scientists predict it will continue to rise an additional 13 to \n19 inches by the end of this century. This will force municipalities to \nreplenish land on beaches stretching from Santa Barbara to San Diego. \nThe EPA says this could cost from $174 million to $3.5 billion.\n  Global warming is California's No. 1 environmental problem.\n  Now, let me talk for a moment about what cities are doing. Cities are \nnot waiting for us. Cities are moving. Members of the United States \nConference of Mayors unanimously passed a resolution earlier this month \nthat requires their member cities to attempt to meet or exceed \nemissions standards set by Kyoto. They have agreed to try to meet or \nbeat the Kyoto Protocol targets in various communities around the \nNation. They have agreed to urge their State governments and the \nFederal Government to enact policies to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions, and they have agreed to urge us to pass the McCain-Lieberman \nbill.\n  So far, 167 cities have signed up to enforce the Kyoto requirements.\n  Nearly 40 States, to date, have developed their own climate plans. \nFour-fifths of the United States is moving on its own because we are so \nslow to act.\n  An emission trading system is emerging in the Northeast that will \nrequire large power plants from Maine to Delaware to reduce their \ncarbon emissions.\n  Eighteen States and the District of Columbia have enacted standards \nto require that electricity be generated with renewable fuels rather \nthan fossil fuels. These States include California,\n\n[[Page S6896]]\n\nArizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, \nMassachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, \nPennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, and Wisconsin.\n  The point is, our States are moving. Why are we so bloody slow? \nCalifornia has enacted legislation that will reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions from vehicle tailpipes. It is expected that the Northeastern \nStates and Canada will also follow California's lead.\n  Yet, without concerted Federal action, the United States will not be \nable to achieve real, significant greenhouse gas reductions. If Members \nof the U.S. Senate agree with the science, if they agree with virtually \nall of the literature to date, if they look out and study the weather \nand they see the changes, if they see the fluctuation in weather \npatterns, the aberrant behavior of weather, they will come to the \nconclusion that global warming is real. It is real, and we now have the \nfirst bill to do something positive about it, and that is the \nLieberman-McCain legislation.\n  I believe all of California supports it. I am proud to support it. I \nurge its passage to this distinguished body.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank our friend and colleague from \nCalifornia for a very powerful statement. In a personal sense, and I \nknow I speak for Senator McCain, we are grateful for her support. We \nare honored to have it. But what a statement. I hope every Member of \nthe Senate gets a chance to read the text of the Feinstein statement. \nIn very practical terms, it describes the impact of inaction on our \nlargest State--California--on water supply, not to mention the dairy \nindustry and, perhaps of more national significance, the California \nwine industry. But this is real-life stuff. Shame on us if we don't \ntake real action to stem the problem.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak out of \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Remarks on Guantanamo Bay\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, more than most people, a Senator lives by \nhis words. Words are the coin of the realm in our profession. \nOccasionally, words will fail us. Occasionally, we will fail words.\n  On June 14, I took the floor of the Senate to speak about genuine, \nheartfelt concerns about the treatment of prisoners and detainees at \nGuantanamo and other places. I raised legitimate concerns that others \nhave raised, including Secretary of State Colin Powell, about the \npolicies of this administration and whether they truly do serve our \nneeds to make America safer and more secure; whether, in fact, some of \nthe policies might, in fact, endanger our troops or in some way \ndisparage the image of America around the world.\n  During the course of that presentation, I read an e-mail from the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation that was discovered to exist last \nAugust and has now been produced as part of a Freedom of Information \nAct. After reading the horrible details in that memo, which \ncharacterized the treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo, I then, on my \nown--my own words--made some characterizations about that memo. I made \nreference to the Nazis, to the Soviets, and other repressive regimes.\n  Mr. President, I have come to understand that was a very poor choice \nof words. Last Friday, I tried to make this very clear, that I \nunderstood that those analogies to the Nazis and Soviets and others \nwere poorly chosen. I issued a release which I thought made my \nintentions and my innermost feelings as clear as I possibly could. Let \nme read to you what I said in that release last Friday:\n\n       I have learned from my statement that historical parallels \n     can be misused and misunderstood. I sincerely regret if what \n     I said caused anyone to misunderstand my true feelings: Our \n     soldiers around the world and their families deserve our \n     respect, admiration and total support.\n\n  It is very clear that even though I thought I had said something that \nclarified the situation, to many people it was still unclear. I am \nsorry if anything I said caused any offense or pain to those who have \nsuch bitter memories of the Holocaust, the greatest moral tragedy of \nour time. Nothing should ever be said to demean or diminish that moral \ntragedy.\n  I am also sorry if anything I said in any way cast a negative light \non our fine men and women in the military. I went to Iraq a few months \nago with Senator Harry Reid and a delegation, a bipartisan delegation; \nthe Presiding Officer was part of it. When you look in the eyes of the \nsoldiers, you see your son or your daughter. They are the best. I \nnever, ever intended any disrespect for them. Some may believe that my \nremarks crossed the line. To them, I extend my heartfelt apologies.\n  There is usually a quote from Abraham Lincoln that you can turn to in \nmoments such as this. Maybe this is the right one. Lincoln said: If the \nend brings me out right, what is said against me won't amount to \nanything. If the end brings me out wrong, 10,000 angels swearing I was \nright wouldn't make any difference.\n  In the end, I don't want anything in my public career to detract from \nmy love for this country, my respect for those who serve it, and this \ngreat Senate.\n  I offer my apologies to those who are offended by my words. I promise \nyou that I will continue to speak out on the issues that I believe are \nimportant to the people of Illinois and to the Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to say what is unnecessary, and \nthat is that the Senator from Illinois just made a heartfelt statement, \none of apology. All of us, I believe, who have had the opportunity to \nserve in public life from time to time have said things that we deeply \nregret. I know that I have. I can't speak for the other Members of this \nbody. I would like to say to the Senator from Illinois, he did the \nright thing, a courageous thing, and I believe we can put this issue \nbehind us. I thank the Senator from Illinois.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I want very briefly to thank my friend \nand colleague, Senator Durbin, for the statement he has just made. I \nknow it has been a very difficult period of time for him. Which one of \nus has not erred? Which one of us, particularly in public life, has not \nsaid something that didn't come out exactly as we intended it to and \ncertainly had an impact we never could have imagined?\n  When I first heard about what Senator Durbin said last week, and I \nheard some people at home in Connecticut who were agitated by it, I \nsaid: I know Dick Durbin. I know he would never really compare the \nsuffering of people in the Nazi concentration camps or the Soviet gulag \nor under Pol Pot to what is happening in Guantanamo, as much as he is \nconcerned and has criticized some of what we have learned, including in \nthe FBI report he cited. It is just not him. I know his character. I \nknow his person.\n  Look, we have seen it today. It takes a big person to stand up and \napologize on the floor of the Senate. He has done it. I just appeal to \neveryone now to move on. Let this be the end of this. Anyone who will \ncontinue to try to fester this some more is doing a disservice to the \nSenate and to our country. Senator Durbin has made clear his regrets \nfor what he said and the way it was misunderstood. He is a good man. He \nis an extraordinary Senator. He is a good friend. I thank him for the \ncourage he showed in coming up and saying what is hard for us in public \nlife, but we are no different than anybody else: I am sorry. I made a \nmistake.\n  To err is human, but it is also important to say that to forgive is \nnot only divine, it ought to be human as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry: Does the Senator from New Mexico \nhave the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I believe that I could now argue against the pending \namendment, but I choose at this point, if we could, because I made some \narrangements that I don't think are inconsistent with the minority \nleader--not\n\n[[Page S6897]]\n\nagreements but arrangements--if we could let Senator Inhofe, who is now \nin opposition to the amendment, proceed, he would like to speak for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico has the floor. I \nwould like to speak for a couple minutes before that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And then could we go to Senator Inhofe for 10 minutes?\n  Mr. REID. I think maybe 5 more minutes, and then we will get to him.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. OK. This is an interesting moment. I don't want to \nobject.\n  Mr. REID. We will be very quick.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks, the \nSenator from California be recognized for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have stated on a number of occasions \npublicly my great affection for my friend from Illinois. We came \ntogether to Congress. He has been a very close personal friend. I have \nsuch great admiration for him. He has been a great whip during the 5 \nmonths that I have been the leader. As we know, he has been a strong \nsupporter of the troops. He has worked for the Guard and Reserve \nespecially, more than anyone I know in the Senate. I know how hard it \nwas for him to come and speak as he has today.\n  I have said things in the past that I wish I hadn't said. In the last \n6 or 7 months, they have been noted more than in the past. So I \ncertainly appreciate the strength and the courage of my friend from \nIllinois.\n  I also want to say a word about my friend who is not on the floor \nnow, John McCain. He and I came to this body also with Senator Durbin. \nHe and I have been very close in seniority. He is one ahead of me \nbecause the State of Arizona is larger than the State of Nevada. That \nis what happened when we came to the Senate. For someone with his \nmilitary background to say what he just said about Senator Durbin is \nvery typical for John McCain. Not only do I express my appreciation for \nthe statement of my friend from Illinois but also for the statement of \nthe Senator from Arizona. It was a very typical John McCain statement, \nand it shows that he is a person who speaks from the heart.\n  If I may impose on my friend from Oklahoma, the other Senator from \nIllinois is here. Senator Feinstein has 2 minutes. May I give him 2 \nminutes?\n  Mr. INHOFE. No objection.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that following Senator Feinstein, \nSenator Obama be recognized for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Democratic leader and \nSenator Inhofe for this courtesy.\n  I don't think there is a Member of this body who hasn't gone to an \nevent, made a speech, answered a question, advocated a cause, who \nhasn't said: Oh, I wish I had done it differently. I don't think there \nare any of us who haven't awoken the next morning and said: Gee, I \nreally meant it, and I am sure it is going to be taken out of context, \nor they are going to think I meant this or that. I don't think there \nare any of us who haven't sometimes written letters to correct what we \nhave said.\n  We know Dick Durbin. We know he is patriotic. We know he cares about \nthe men and women serving. And we know that he would do nothing to ever \nmean anything to the contrary.\n  I was very much taken by his remarks. More importantly, I was taken \nby the emotion behind the remarks. We have been having in the Judiciary \nCommittee a legitimate debate on Guantanamo. Hearings have been held. \nDebate is taking place. That is healthy. That is what this system is \nall about. Senator Durbin has played a role in that debate. I hope, \ntoo, that this will mark the end of it.\n  I thank, too, the Senator from Arizona for what he said. No one has a \nmore distinguished military record than he. I also hope that everyone \nwho has heard Senator Durbin tonight recognizes his sincerity and his \ndepth of concern. Let this be the end of it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I thank Senator Inhofe, Senator Reid, and \nSenator Domenici for allowing me this time.\n  I know Dick Durbin. I serve with him in Illinois. We have traveled \ntogether through the byways and highways of our great State. I have \nrarely met someone with greater dedication to ordinary Americans, a \nstronger belief in the greatness of this Nation, or a more longstanding \ncommitment to public service as an expression of that patriotism than \nDick Durbin.\n  This recent episode obviously has pained him a great deal because \nalthough I am new in the Senate, one of the things I am discovering is \nthat we have a tendency, perhaps because we don't share as much time on \nthe floor as we should, perhaps because our politics seem to be ginned \nup by interest groups and blogs and the Internet, we have a tendency to \ndemonize and jump on and make mockery of each other across the aisle. \nThat is particularly pronounced when we make mistakes. Each and every \none of us is going to make a mistake once in a while. We are going to \nsay something unartful; we are going to say something that doesn't \nappropriately describe our intentions. And what we hope is that our \ntrack record of service, the scope of how we have operated and \ninteracted with people, will override whatever particular mistake we \nmake.\n\n  Senator Durbin has established himself as one of the people in this \nChamber who cares deeply about our veterans and our troops. He hasn't \njust talked the talk, he has walked the walk. I have been distressed to \nsee my partner from Illinois placed in the situation in which he has \nbeen placed. I am grateful he had the courage to stand up and \nacknowledge that he should have said what he said somewhat differently. \nBut I am also grateful that people, such as the distinguished Senator \nfrom Arizona and others, recognize this for what it was--a simple \nmisstatement--and that now we can move on to talk about the substance \nof the issues that are of legitimate concern to this body, including \nmaking certain that when we operate institutions such as those at \nGuantanamo, we hold the United States to that high standard that all of \nus expect.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 826\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the leader for \nallowing me to get in about 10 minutes to respond to some of the things \nsaid about the McCain-Lieberman legislation. First of all, I know how \nsincere both Senators McCain and Lieberman are. They deeply believe in \ntheir cause.\n  However, as chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I \nfeel compelled to refute some of the things that have been said. So \nwhat I have done--and I think I can do this in a very short period of \ntime--is look at some of the statements made and respond to them. Now, \ntomorrow, we will have enough time to get into a lot of details. I have \ncharts I wish to show. I will give a full-blown presentation. For \ntonight, I will let my colleagues know there are a lot of things we \nshould be looking at and not just assuming that everything that has \nbeen said is true. I know they believe it, but some of these things are \nnot true.\n  First of all, the discussion on hurricanes--that hurricanes are going \nto be impacted in a way that will be detrimental and we are all going \nto blow away. Let's keep in mind that the same people who are talking \nabout global warming and all of the catastrophic things are the same \nones who were talking about gobal cooling about 25 years ago, saying \nthat another ice age is coming, that we are all going to die. On \nhurricanes, according to Dr. Christopher Lansey, one of the foremost \nexperts today on hurricanes, he said that hurricanes are going to \ncontinue to hit the United States on the Atlantic and gulf coast, and \nthe damage will probably be more extensive than in the past, but this \nis due to natural climate cycles, which cause hurricanes to be stronger \nand more frequent and rising property prices on the coast, not because \nof any affect of CO2 emissions on weather. He goes on to say \nthat it is determined that the total number of Atlantic hurricanes \nmaking landfall in the United States decreased from the normalized \ntrend of U.S. hurricanes. The damage reveals a decreasing rate. In \nother words, they are decreasing. Finally, contrary to the belief--this \nis Dr. Christopher Lansey--reducing CO2 emissions will not \nlessen the impact of hurricanes.\n\n[[Page S6898]]\n\n  We can say anything we want on the floor of the Senate. These are \nscientists. He says the best way to reduce the toll hurricanes will \ntake on coastal communities is through adaptation and preparation. I \nbelieve that is true.\n  Second, they brought up the Arctic. I think when you look at some of \nthe reports on the Arctic--I will quote from the report that was given \nbefore the Commerce Committee, Senator McCain's Committee, at that \ntime. He said:\n\n       Arctic climate varies dramatically from one region to \n     another and, over time, in ways that cannot be accurately \n     reproduced by climate models. The quantitative impacts of \n     natural and anthropogenic factors remain highly uncertain, \n     especially for a region as complex as the Arctic. In contrast \n     to global and hemispheric temperatures, the maritime Arctic \n     temperature was higher in the 1930s through the early 1940s \n     than it was in the 1990s.\n\n  That contradicts everything that has been said about the Arctic. I \nwill elaborate on this tomorrow.\n  It has been stated by one of the proponents of the McCain-Lieberman \nbill that there are modest costs involved. I will look at the impact. \nThis is the CRA International analysis--not of S. 139 as it was before \nbut as it has been pared down and supposedly will have less economic \nimpact. They said that enacting McCain-Lieberman will cost the economy \n$507 billion in year 2020. Enacting McCain-Lieberman would mean a loss \nof 840,000 U.S. jobs in 2010. It will result in 1.306 million jobs in \n2020. That is not just a domino effect. Enacting McCain-Lieberman would \ncost the average U.S. household up to $810 in 2020. The figure used \nbefore was $2,700 for the average family of four.\n\n  The NAS, a letter about the NAS, let's take a look at that. The \nNational Academy of Sciences--and I will quote out of their report--\nsaid:\n\n       There is considerable uncertainty and current understanding \n     of how the climate system varies naturally and reacts to \n     emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols.\n\n  Further quoting:\n\n       A casual linkage between the buildup of greenhouse gases \n     and the observed climate change in the 20th century cannot be \n     unequivocally established; thirdly, the IPCC--\n\n  That is the report of the International Panel on Climate Change of \nthe United Nations.\n\n       Summary for policymakers could give an impression that the \n     science of global warming is settled, even though many \n     uncertainties still remain.\n\n  Again, that is the National Academy of Sciences.\n  The Senator from California brought up the hockey stick theory. I \nbelieve that deserves more time than we will have tonight. I plan on \ntalking about this tomorrow because when Michael Mann came up with the \nwhole hockey stick theory, he talked about projecting the temperatures \nover the period of time, until the 20th century came along, and then \nthey went up and off the charts. What he neglected to say, I say to my \nfriend from Connecticut, is that there was another blade to this hockey \nstick, and that was the blade there during the medieval warming period. \nIt is pretty well established now that the temperatures during the \nmedieval warming period were actually higher than they were during this \ncentury--the current blade he talks about. That is significant. We will \nhave a chance to elaborate on that.\n  Finally, in the timeframe I have, I will say that when it is referred \nto that the Senator from Oklahoma will come up with some ``obscure'' \nscientist who might disagree, you are right, he will, because there are \na lot of them out there who are pretty well educated. The Oregon \nPetition was made up of 17,800 scientists. I will quote from their \nreport. They said:\n\n       There is no convincing scientific evidence that human \n     release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases \n     is causing, or will in the foreseeable future cause, \n     catastrophic heating of the earth's atmosphere and disruption \n     of the earth's climate. Moreover, there is substantial \n     scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon \n     dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural \n     plant and animal environments of the earth.\n\n  I think we are going to have an opportunity--at least I will--to talk \nabout many of the other scientists. At least we have to come to the \nconclusion that there are uncertainties out there. I think the people \nwho try to say the science is settled believe that if they keep saying \nthe same thing over and over again, people will believe it. Quite \nfrankly, there is a very friendly media to the alarmists, those who \nwant to believe there is a real serious problem that, No. 1, the \nclimate is changing; and, No. 2, the changes are due to anthropogenic \ngases or manmade gases, when, in fact, the science is not settled.\n\n  I believe this is very important for people to realize. People might \nask the question, If the science is not settled and if there is that \nmuch of an economic problem with this, then what could be motivating \npeople to be so concerned about our signing on to the Kyoto treaty? \nMargot Wallstrom is the EU Environment Commissioner. She said that \nKyoto is about the economy, about leveling the playing field for big \nbusiness worldwide. Another hero to some, Jacques Chirac, had a lot to \nsay when he weighed in. Talking about it has nothing to do with climate \nchange, he said that Kyoto represents the first component of an \nauthentic global governance.\n  There are people who are motivated by wanting to effect economic \ndamage to our country. Tomorrow, we will have opportunity to cover in \nmuch more detail the fact that there is another side to this story.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The senior Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. What is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The current business is amendment No. 826 \noffered by the Senators from Arizona and Connecticut.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I yield to my colleague from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have already told the minority what I \nwas going to do if I can get an understanding. Senators DeWine and Kohl \nwant to offer an amendment. I ask them if they could complete their \namendment--allowing the Senator from New Mexico 1 minute--in 6 minutes \nbetween the two.\n  Mr. DeWINE. We can certainly do whatever the Senator would like us to \ndo.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am not trying to tell you; I am asking if you can do \nthat.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That will be voice voted, however it turns out. Then we \nare going to proceed, without objection, to Senator Voinovich, who has \nan amendment which has been circulated for a while. He desires to \ndebate that amendment and have a rollcall vote, correct?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If anybody wants to speak in opposition, I will ask \nthat they have 1 minute and that you have 6 minutes on your side. Is \nthat satisfactory?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask that it be in order to ask for the yeas and nays \nnow for the Voinovich amendment when it is appropriately before the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We can proceed with the rest of the consent agreement, \nand then we are back on the Senator's amendment. If I failed to ask \nthat the McCain-Lieberman be temporarily set aside while this is \noccurring, I so request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, let me understand the unanimous consent \nagreement. The pending amendment would be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator DeWine and Senator Kohl will be \nrecognized for 6 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And Senator Voinovich will be recognized, and we will \nhave a vote following that; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. And one addition; the Senator \nfrom New Mexico wants 1 minute to speak.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Now I understand.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator. I am sorry I did not make it clear \nenough. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The senior Senator from Ohio is recognized for 6 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 788\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I send to the desk amendment No. 788.\n\n[[Page S6899]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine], for himself, Mr. Kohl, \n     Mr. Specter, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Feingold, Mr. \n     Coburn, Mr. Levin, Ms. Snowe, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Dayton, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 788.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Sherman Act to make oil-producing and exporting \n                            cartels illegal)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. NO OIL PRODUCING AND EXPORTING CARTELS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``No Oil \n     Producing and Exporting Cartels Act of 2005'' or ``NOPEC''.\n       (b) Sherman Act.--The Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. 1 et seq.) is \n     amended by adding after section 7 the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 7A. OIL PRODUCING CARTELS.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--It shall be illegal and a violation of \n     this Act for any foreign state, or any instrumentality or \n     agent of any foreign state, to act collectively or in \n     combination with any other foreign state, any instrumentality \n     or agent of any other foreign state, or any other person, \n     whether by cartel or any other association or form of \n     cooperation or joint action--\n       ``(1) to limit the production or distribution of oil, \n     natural gas, or any other petroleum product;\n       ``(2) to set or maintain the price of oil, natural gas, or \n     any petroleum product; or\n       ``(3) to otherwise take any action in restraint of trade \n     for oil, natural gas, or any petroleum product;\n     when such action, combination, or collective action has a \n     direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect on the \n     market, supply, price, or distribution of oil, natural gas, \n     or other petroleum product in the United States.\n       ``(b) Sovereign Immunity.--A foreign state engaged in \n     conduct in violation of subsection (a) shall not be immune \n     under the doctrine of sovereign immunity from the \n     jurisdiction or judgments of the courts of the United States \n     in any action brought to enforce this section.\n       ``(c) Inapplicability of Act of State Doctrine.--No court \n     of the United States shall decline, based on the act of state \n     doctrine, to make a determination on the merits in an action \n     brought under this section.\n       ``(d) Enforcement.--The Attorney General of the United \n     States and the Federal Trade Commission may bring an action \n     to enforce this section in any district court of the United \n     States as provided under the antitrust laws.''.\n       (c) Sovereign Immunity.--Section 1605(a) of title 28, \n     United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (6), by striking ``or'' after the \n     semicolon;\n       (2) in paragraph (7), by striking the period and inserting \n     ``; or''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(8) in which the action is brought under section 7A of \n     the Sherman Act.''.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I join my colleague, Senator Kohl, \nand 16 cosponsors to offer the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels \nAct of 2005 to the Energy bill. This amendment would give the \nDepartment of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission legal authority \nto bring an antitrust case against the Organization of Petroleum \nExporting Countries.\n  We need this amendment because, simply put, gas and oil prices are \ntoo high, and it is time that we do something about it. Every consumer \nin America knows that gasoline prices are simply too high.\n  What is the cause? There are a number of causes, but certainly one of \nthem, the primary cause, is the increase in imported crude oil prices. \nWho sets these prices? OPEC does. The unacceptably high price of \nimported crude oil is a direct result of price fixing by the OPEC \nnations to keep the price of oil unnaturally high.\n  What this amendment does is to give the executive branch permission \nor authority--it does not compel them to do it--it gives them authority \nto file under our antitrust laws against OPEC. If this was any other \nbusiness, if this was any business in this country or any other \ninternational business, they could be filed against. What this \namendment simply does is it makes it very clear that they come under \nour antitrust laws.\n  It is the right thing to do. I ask my colleagues to adopt the \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my colleague, Senator Kohl.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has 3 minutes 50 \nseconds.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to offer, with Senator DeWine, an \namendment which will authorize our Government, for the first time, to \ntake action against the illegal conduct of the OPEC oil cartel. Indeed, \nit is time for the U.S. Government to fight back on the price of oil \nand hold OPEC accountable when it acts illegally. This amendment, \nidentical to our NOPEC bill, which passed the Judiciary Committee \nunanimously three times over the past 5 years, most recently this past \nApril, will enable our Government to hold OPEC member nations to \naccount under U.S. antitrust law for illegal conduct in limiting supply \nand fixing prices in violation of the most basic prices of free \ncompetition.\n  Let me tell you what our amendment does and what it does not do. What \nit does is it simply authorizes our Government to take legal action \nagainst OPEC member nations to participate in a conspiracy to limit the \nsupply or fix the price of oil. But this amendment will not require the \nGovernment to bring legal action against OPEC member nations. This \ndecision will remain entirely in the discretion of the executive \nbranch. Private suits are not authorized. All our amendment will do is \ngive our law enforcement agencies a tool to employ against the OPEC oil \ncartel. The decision whether to use this tool will be entirely up to \nthe administration. They can use this tool as often as they see fit, \nhowever they see fit to file a legal action, to jawbone OPEC in \ndiplomatic discussions, or defer from any action should they judge \nforeign policy or other considerations that warrant it.\n  The most fundamental principle of a free market is that competitors \ncannot be permitted to conspire to limit or fix price. There can be no \nfree market without this foundation, and we should not permit any \nnation to flout this fundamental principle.\n  There is nothing remarkable about applying U.S. antitrust law \noverseas. Our Government has not hesitated to do so when faced with the \nclear evidence of anticompetitive conduct that harms American \nconsumers. If OPEC were a group of international private companies \nrather than foreign governments, their actions would be nothing more \nthan an illegal price-fixing scheme. But OPEC members have used the \nshield of sovereign immunity to escape accountability for their price \nfixing. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, however, already \nrecognizes that the commercial activity of nations is not protected by \nsovereign immunity. And it is hard to imagine an activity that is more \nobviously commercial than selling oil for profit as OPEC nations do.\n  The suffering of consumers across our country in the last year \ndemonstrates yet again that this legislation is necessary. Our \namendment will have, at a minimum, a deterrent effect on nations that \nseek to join forces to fix oil prices to the detriment of consumers. It \nwill force OPEC member nations to face substantial and real antitrust \nsanctions should they persist in their illegal conduct.\n  Before yielding the floor, I want to express my gratitude to my good \nfriend and colleague, Senator DeWine, for all his efforts over the past \n5 years on this important measure. I also wish to thank the many \ncosponsors who have joined us on this amendment, including the chairman \nand the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am proud to cosponsor this amendment, as I have been \nglad to cosponsor the ``No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act,'' \nwhich we have been working to pass since 2001. I commend our lead \nsponsors Senators DeWine and Kohl.\n  I wish that we could have considered and passed this bill, S. 555, on \nits own. This bill passed out of the Judiciary Committee with \noverwhelming support earlier this year. I have repeatedly called for \nits consideration by the Senate over the last several months.\n  In the face of crude oil prices over $55 a barrel and gas prices at \nhistoric and sustained high levels, and in the face of determined \ninaction by the White\n\n[[Page S6900]]\n\nHouse, we must seize whatever opportunity presents itself.\n  It is long past time for the Congress to hold OPEC accountable for \nits anticompetitive behavior. This amendment will prevent the U.S. from \nbeing at the mercy of the OPEC cartel by making them subject to our \nantitrust laws. It will allow the Federal Government to take legal \naction against any foreign state, including members of OPEC, for price \nfixing and other anticompetitive activities.\n  In March of 2004, more than a year ago, I wrote Senator Hatch to \nrequest a hearing about the skyrocketing cost of gasoline. In that \nletter, I raised concerns that this increase was largely due to market \nmanipulation by OPEC, and I cited the high average price for a gallon \nof gasoline, which at the time was around $1.74. Many of us would today \nconsider that price a bargain, having been forced to pay over $2.00, \nand even more this year. At that hearing, witnesses told us what we had \nsuspected to be true: The price of crude oil, determined by OPEC's \nartificial production quotas, is the factor that most explains the \nprice Americans pay at the pump.\n  The artificial pricing scheme enforced by OPEC affects all of us. \nThis week, Vermonters were paying $2.10 for a gallon of regular \ngasoline, just three cents below the national average. These prices \naffect everyone. Higher fuel prices can add thousands of dollars in \nyearly costs to a 100-head dairy operation in the Northeast. And as our \nsummer months approach, many families are going to find that OPEC has \nput an expensive crimp in their plans. Some are likely to stay home--\nothers will pay more to drive or to fly so that they can visit their \nfamilies or take their well-deserved vacations.\n  Rising interest rates are also adding to the burden felt by working \nAmericans. Pension insecurity is another catastrophe for some and a \nlooming specter for too many others. Millions of Americans who trusted \nthat the pensions they were promised by their employers would be there \nfor them when they retired are being shocked by rulings in bankruptcy \ncases that let their employers off the hook and turn their pension \nsecurity into a hollow promise.\n  Congress needs to do more. The administration needs to do more. \nAuthorizing action against illegal oil price fixing and taking that \naction without delay is one thing we can do without additional \nobstruction or delay.\n  Last month, as some Republicans were pushing this body to the brink \nof the so-called nuclear option, Americans were thinking not about the \nhandful of controversial judicial nominees on which the Senate was \nfixated, but about the pinch they feel at the pump every time they fill \nup their cars. A survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the \nPress showed that Americans were following news about gasoline prices \nmore closely than any other story, including the ongoing conflict in \nIraq. It is long passed the time for walking hand-in-hand with Saudi \nprinces and exchanging kisses with those who are responsible for the \nartificially high prices that are gouging American working families at \nthe pump.\n  The President's solution to high gasoline prices this summer is to \nopen the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, pristine wilderness area, to \noil drilling. The only catch is drilling in ANWR will not provide any \nnew oil for at least 7 to 12 years. ANWR drilling will do absolutely \nnothing to help my constituents who have sticker shock at the gas pump \nor will be facing record-high home heating prices in a few months.\n  This amendment will provide law enforcement with the tools necessary \nto fight OPEC's anticompetitive practices immediately, and help reduce \ngasoline prices now, rather than waiting for another decade.\n  Again, I am pleased to support this amendment and urge my colleagues \nto maintain it in the final version of the bill. After the years of \nJudiciary consideration, including a hearing on this topic, after twice \nreporting the measure to the Senate, it is time for Senators to finally \nsay ``no'' to OPEC.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, is there any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 20 seconds.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, this is what our bill says: When you want \nto do business with America, you must abide by our antitrust laws and \nrules of the free market. When OPEC one day abides by the rules of the \nfree market, we will all see lower oil and gas prices. That is what \nthis amendment is about.\n  I yield the floor. I thank Senator Domenici.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, obviously I am letting this amendment \nproceed, but, frankly, I do not think the amendment should be on this \nbill. I do not think it could ever become law. The United States has \nnever done this. These are sovereign nations, and for us to decide here \non the Senate floor that we are going to establish some new forum for \njurisdiction and litigation against the OPEC cartel is nothing short of \nincredible.\n  Nonetheless, I do not question the goodwill and the authenticity of \nthe two Senators in their approach. They do not insist on a rollcall \nvote, and I will not insist on one. We will, therefore, have a voice \nvote. I hope those who are listening to this and see what we do \nunderstand that the Senate does things different ways at different \ntimes.\n  After the amendment is adopted by voice vote, I will tell the Senate \nand those interested what is going to happen to the amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest that we vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n788.\n  The amendment (No. 788) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we are going to proceed to the Voinovich \namendment. I thank Senator DeWine for accommodating us tonight and for \nhis good intention. I wish we could do something and accomplish what he \nwanted to do today. I want everybody to know because we had a voice \nvote and accepted this amendment, we will go to conference with the \nHouse. It should be clearly understood that the House does not have \nanything like this. I want everybody to know that this amendment is \ngoing to have to be bundled up with this bill. Those are the rules. But \nit might get lost between the floor and the time we get over to the \nSenate, and we may not be able to find it when we get over there, just \nso everybody understands what the fate of this amendment is. But it has \nbeen adopted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 799\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I wish to make a brief statement before \nwe vote on the Voinovich, Carper, Feinstein, Jeffords, Hutchison, \nStevens, Clinton, Obama, Lautenberg, DeWine, Levin, and Alexander \namendment. It is based on the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act of 2005, \nS. 1265. That bill is cosponsored by the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee chairman, Jim Inhofe, Ranking Member Jeffords, Senators Tom \nCarper, Johnny Isakson, Hillary Clinton, Kay Bailey Hutchison, and \nDianne Feinstein.\n  The bill was developed in close consultation with a strong and \ndiverse group of environmental, industrial, and public officials. The \ngroups range from the Environmental Defense, to the Union of Concerned \nScientists, to the Associated General Contractors of America, to the \nEngine Manufacturers Association, to the Chamber of Commerce, to the \nNational Conference of State Legislators.\n  The cosponsors and these groups do not agree on many issues, which is \nwhy this amendment is so special. It is focused on improving air \nquality and protecting public health. It establishes voluntary national \nand State level grant and loan programs to promote the reduction of \ndiesel emissions. It authorizes $1 billion over 5 years, $200 million \nannually.\n  Onroad and nonroad diesel vehicles and engines account for roughly \none-half of the nitrogen oxide and particulate matter mobile source \nemissions nationwide, and diesel retrofits have proven to be one of the \nmost cost-effective emission reduction strategies. The\n\n[[Page S6901]]\n\nbill has a 13-to-1 cost-benefit ratio. Spectacular.\n  This would help bring counties into attainment with new air quality \nstandards by encouraging the retrofitting and replacements of diesel \nengines.\n  The Diesel Emissions Reduction Act of 2005 enjoys broad bipartisan \nsupport and is needed desperately. I urge my colleagues to vote for \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. President, I would like to now yield the remainder of my time to \nmy longstanding good friend, Senator Carper, and say it is wonderful to \nbe on the floor of the Senate cosponsoring with him an amendment that \nhas such broad support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for the leadership he \nhas shown on this particular issue to unite environmental groups and \nbusiness groups, people from the Republican chairman of our Environment \nand Public Works Committee, to the junior Senator from New York on our \nside. It is a remarkable coalition that has been put together in a very \nshort period of time.\n  With respect to diesel engines, there is good news and bad news. The \ngood news is that diesel engines last a long time. The bad news is that \nold diesel engines that are still on our highways and roads last a long \ntime. In fact, there are about 11 million of them. While next year our \nnew EPA requirements for lean-burn, clean-burn diesel engines--so-\ncalled tier 2 standards--kick in and requirements for lower sulfur \ncontent diesel fuel kick in, we have 11 million older diesel vehicles, \nsome of which will be around until 2030 belching out nitrogen oxide.\n  Half the nitrogen oxide we emit comes from these 11 million diesel \nengines--school buses, regular buses, boats, locomotives, trucks. That \nis where half of our nitrogen oxide emissions come from. It causes fog, \nand the particulates that come out of our diesel engines lead to all \nkinds of lung diseases in people young and old. That is the bad news.\n  There is some more good news. The good news is we can do something \nabout it. Senator Voinovich and others said the thing to do is create a \npartnership with the Federal Government, State government, EPA, and \nsome of the private sector folks to put in place retrofit devices on \nthese older diesel engines to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide and \nparticulate, in some cases, by as much as 85 percent.\n  It is cost effective. The effect will be immediate. We do not have to \nwait until 2030 until these vehicles are off the road to start cleaning \nup our engines.\n  The last thing I will say is good environmental policy can also be \ngood business policy. Companies such as Corning, Cummings, Caterpillar \nare making these devices and installing these devices, and they will do \na whole lot more in the days to come. They will make money, a profit, \nfrom doing this. They will create products that can be exported, not \njobs but products that can be exported to other parts of the world.\n  We will have cleaner air and, frankly, a stronger economy. That is a \ngreat win-win situation for all of us. I am delighted Senator Voinovich \nproposed this. I am delighted to join him as a principal sponsor on our \nside and anxious to get this vote recorded.\n  My hope is that maybe we can actually pass this unanimously. That \nwould be a wonderful thing for our country and a good thing for this \nbill. I thank my friend from Ohio for yielding this time and providing \nsuch terrific leadership.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from Ohio \nas a cosponsor of this important amendment to improve air quality and \npublic health by reducing emissions from diesel engines.\n  I believe that this amendment will take important strides not only \ntoward the stated goal of reducing emissions but also in making \nadvanced clean diesel technology more viable in the United States. \nDiesel engines now can increase fuel economy by as much as 25 to 40 \npercent. If we can do that--and do it without harmful tailpipe \nemissions--we could make significant progress toward improving overall \nfuel economy and reducing our oil consumption.\n  This bipartisan amendment would establish national and State grant \nand loan programs to promote reduction of diesel emissions. The \namendment authorizes $200 million annually for 5 years to fund programs \nthat will help us to replace older diesel technology with newer, \ncleaner diesel technology. The grant program, which will be \nadministered by the Environmental Protection Agency, has the potential \nto result in significant reductions in diesel particulate matter and \nhelp communities in meeting national ambient air quality standards.\n  Under this amendment, 70 percent of the funds available would be to \nprovide grants and low-cost revolving loans on a competitive basis for \nretrofit of buses, heavy duty trucks, locomotives, or non-road engines \nto help achieve significant emissions reductions particularly from \nfleets operating in poor air quality areas. The remaining 30 percent of \nthe funds would go for grant and loan programs administered by states.\n  The important steps that will be taken by these programs offer great \npromise for reducing diesel emissions and making clean diesel a \ncommercially viable advanced vehicle technology in the U.S. Our friends \nin Europe have taken advantage of the opportunities that diesel offers \nfor improving fuel economy and reducing oil dependence. We have not \nbeen able to do so here in the U.S. because of our concerns about \ntailpipe emissions. Initiatives such as those included in this \namendment will help the U.S. to develop advanced diesel technology that \nwill be able to meet our emissions standards in a cost-effective \nmanner.\n  I am pleased to join my colleagues today in supporting this \namendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Voinovich \namendment on diesel emissions reductions. I am an original cosponsor of \nthe legislation which is the same as this amendment. I agree with the \nintent of this amendment, I believe it is helpful to provide a \nvoluntary national and state-level grant and loan program to promote \nthe reduction of diesel emissions. However, I am concerned that this \nproposal is being rushed through the process without the benefit of \nconsideration by the committee of jurisdiction, the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, which I chair.\n  I would prefer, prior to Senate action, that the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee conduct legislative hearings on the issue, and \nensure that the program design meets its goals in a cost-effective \nmanner. I am concerned about the $1 billion cost of the program and I \nbelieve the goals might be accomplished with a smaller sum. I also \nbelieve that if this amendment is adopted, it needs to be reconciled \nwith section 723 of this bill. I hope these issues will be given \nconsideration as this legislation is reconciled with the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I did not hear. Pardon me. What is the question?\n  Mr. CARPER. I have no question.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Are we finished? Is the Senator finished with his time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand that there is no further time. I am \nsupposed to sit down. We are not supposed to ask for a motion, say we \nmove to proceed, we just sit down, and then the Chair does it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n799.

Mr. President, we are not going to have any additional \nvotes tonight. That is the first announcement I would like to make. But \nI also would like to suggest that, while the principal amendment, in \nterms of time tomorrow, is the McCain-Lieberman amendment on global \nclimate change, there are now a number of amendments that are \npercolating up on the Democratic side predominantly. We are unable yet \nto come up with a list, but we are trying.\n  It seems the distinguished Senator from New York, standing right in \nfront of me, might have one we could go with rather quickly in the \nmorning and perhaps the Senator from California, but I have to consult \nboth with Senator Bingaman, obviously, and others.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am here to speak on the importance of a \nnational energy policy and to express my staunch opposition to the \ninclusion of an amendment offered by my colleagues from Arizona and \nConnecticut that creates a mandatory carbon cap and trade program.\n  Before doing so, however, I want to take a moment to thank the \nchairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator \nDomenici, for his hard work on the bill. Senator Domenici has worked \nexceedingly hard to craft truly bipartisan consensus legislation. I \ncommend him for that work. I commend everyone that has worked on this \nbill under his direction. It is extremely important we have an energy \npolicy.\n  I remember 1973 when OPEC shut off the supply. We had gas lines for \nwhat little natural gas there was. At that time, the seat I now hold \nwas held by Senator Cliff Hansen from Wyoming. He expressed the need \nfor an energy policy. Ever since that time we have been talking about \nthe need for an energy policy. Now is the time we can have an energy \npolicy. Let's finish the job.\n  From the time I was first elected to be the mayor of Gillette, WY, \nduring the energy boom years of the 1980s, I have advocated the need \nfor a comprehensive national energy policy. I come to the Senate today \nas a strong advocate for such a policy and to share my support for the \nversion of the bill pending before the Senate. We have debated the \nmerits of a comprehensive Energy bill for years. We have come close to \npassing an Energy bill on a number of occasions. At the end of the day, \nhowever, the Congress has not made those discussions a reality and our \ninaction has caused the energy situation in our Nation to worsen.\n  Oil prices have reached nearly $60 a barrel, more than double what \nthey were in 2000. Unfortunately, as our demand for gasoline has \nincreased, our Nation's refining capacity has not. This has led to \nrecord-high gasoline prices, and while high natural gas prices have \nhelped my State, they continue to have damaging effects on consumers \nacross the Nation.\n  Without a comprehensive national energy strategy, there is no end in \nsight for the problems we see. The high energy prices that are hurting \nsmall business will continue to make increased investment in those \nbusinesses difficult. The high energy prices that limit the ability of \nfamilies to go on vacations will continue to make those trips more and \nmore rare. The high energy prices that make it difficult for lower \nincome people to pay their bills each month will continue to price them \nout of proper heating in the winter and proper cooling in the summer.\n  Never before has there been a time when it is more appropriate for \nCongress to act. Before the Senate, we have a comprehensive Energy bill \nthat is a step in the right direction. This bill balances the need for \nincreased domestic production while maintaining a commitment to \nenvironmental protection and energy conservation. It will help reduce \nour dependence on foreign sources of oil and will enhance our energy \nsecurity.\n  This bill provides a blueprint for future energy production. At the \nsame time, it addresses our energy needs of today. In its current form, \nthe bill recognizes that the production of energy and the protection of \nenvironment are not mutually exclusive. It recognizes we can grow our \neconomy and conserve energy.\n  Specifically, I am pleased this bill includes a number of important \nprovisions that support and promote clean coal development. Coal is an \nextremely important resource in Wyoming and throughout our Nation. We \nhave as many Btu's in coal in Wyoming as the Middle East has in oil. \nWyoming has the largest coal reserves in our Nation. In fact, the \ncounty in which I served as a mayor has more coal than most foreign \ncountries. Thus, any comprehensive energy solution that seeks to lessen \nour dependence on foreign energy sources must make coal a central part \nof the discussion.\n\n  Recognizing this, H.R. 6 authorizes $200 million per year for fiscal \nyears 2006 through 2014 to be spent on clean coal technologies. It also \nincorporates a number of necessary changes to the Mineral Leasing Act \nto promote the development of our Federal coal resources.\n  The bill also repeals the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, \nalso known as PUHCA. PUHCA was enacted to eliminate unfair practices \nand other abuses by electricity and gas holding companies by requiring \nFederal control and regulation of interstate public utility holding \ncompanies. In 1935, that made sense. But today, with the oversight by \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, by State public utility \ncommissions, by the Department of Justice, and by the Federal Trade \nCommission, what was once a useful and necessary tool now unnecessarily \nstands as a barrier to increased investment in transmission capacity.\n  I am pleased that the tax title of the bill includes a provision to \naddress our Nation's need for increased refinery capacity. I am pleased \nthat it promotes increased investment in renewable technologies, such \nas wind power and hydrogen. There is no question that we need to pass \nthe energy bill we are debating because it will truly benefit our \nnation.\n  While I support this bill as it is currently written, the amendment \nthat is currently pending would have a disastrous effect on our economy \nand would ignore principles that the Senate laid out in previous \ndebates dealing with the issue of climate change. Passage of an \namendment like the one before us, that would implement a mandatory \ncarbon cap-and-trade program, would jeopardize my support of the \noverall bill. I want to take a moment to share my staunch opposition to \nthat amendment.\n  Climate change is a topic that we have debated for years. This topic \nshould be familiar to us. Nonetheless, it is important to share a \nhistorical\n\n[[Page S6903]]\n\nperspective about where the Senate stands on climate change and to make \nclear that the proposal we are discussing, which implements a mandatory \ncarbon cap-and-trade program, flies in the face of the Senate's stated \nposition on global climate change.\n  I took advantage of the opportunity to go to Kyoto for the global \nclimate change conference that was held there. At that conference, the \nKyoto Protocol was drafted. One of the things I noticed when I got to \nthe conference was that the United States was the only country there \nthat thought it was an environmental conference. The rest of the world \napproached it as an economic conference, one where they had an \nopportunity to slow down the U.S. economy and allow for growth in their \nnations.\n  On the other hand, we approached it as an environmental conference. \nIn doing so, we laid out some strict guidelines for our delegation to \nwork within as they tried to reach an agreement. Unfortunately, on the \nlast night some of those were compromised. The United States made some \nagreements that would be impossible for us to ever meet.\n  Before the debate first began in Kyoto about the need to control \ncarbon emissions--that was in 1997--the Senate made a clear and direct \nstatement of principle on that subject. When it came to negotiations on \nclimate, we stated that any agreement that did not treat all nations, \nboth developed and developing, equally was unacceptable. We also made \nit clear that we would not support an agreement that would cause \nserious harm to our economy. By a vote of 95 to 0, on July 25, 1997, \nthe Senate approved the Byrd-Hagel resolution that explicitly stated \nthe Senate's position.\n  The Byrd-Hagel resolution addressed the concerns of those who believe \nthat a global climate change policy would ``result in serious harm to \nthe United States economy, including significant job loss, trade \ndisadvantages, and increased energy and consumer costs.''\n  It also addressed concerns that any effort to reduce global emissions \nwould be imposed only on developed nations, ignoring developing nations \nwhere emissions would continue to rise without any effective controls. \nLet me repeat that again. We would oppose any efforts to reduce global \nemissions that would be imposed only on developed nations, ignoring the \ndeveloping world where emissions would continue to rise without any \neffective controls.\n  Now, the Senate agreed to take this position in the 105th Congress. \nSince that time, nothing has changed. The science behind global climate \nchange remains uncertain. The modeling that many used to ``prove'' that \nclimate change exists remains fatally flawed. Yet we continue to have \nthe same debate year after year.\n  We ignore the fact that the Bush administration has taken steps to \nreduce our carbon emissions. We ignore the fact that as a nation we are \ndoing better than nearly every European signatory of the Kyoto Protocol \nwhen comparing greenhouse gas intensity reductions.\n  We also ignore the fact that climate change is a global problem. \nUnless we engage the developing world, whatever reductions we have in \nthe United States will not improve the situation on a global scale.\n  We are just a couple of years from having China exceed the emissions \nthat we have in the United States. They will do so without any of the \nenvironmental safeguards that we have already put in place.\n  When I was at the Kyoto conference, I had an opportunity to meet with \nthe Chinese delegation. I had a couple things that I was interested in: \nOne, why they thought, as a developing nation, they should not have to \ndo anything to address climate change; and, just as importantly, at \nwhat point they thought they would no longer be a developing nation so \nthey could participate in this.\n  They let me know they expected to always be a developing nation and \nto never have a part in the Kyoto Protocol. It is pretty easy to sign \nsomething that you do not have to do anything on, especially when it \nwill force one of your main economic competitors to comply and reduce \ntheir production.\n\n  Then, I even asked: Is there any time at some future, unspecified \ndate that you would be willing to participate? They said no. That is as \nloose as you can make it: some future, unspecified date. And they are \nnot interested in participating.\n  Not only is the rest of the developing world not participating. The \nbiggest polluter--in a couple of years--is not going to be a part of \nany of the action to reduce carbon emissions in the world.\n  Now, instead of working to improve the science and to improve \ntechnologies that will inevitably reduce the amount of carbon released \ninto the atmosphere, a number of my colleagues focus on the need for a \nmandatory carbon cap-and-trade system. They focus on implementing what \ncan only be described as another energy tax. Such a tax will cause the \nUnited States to lose jobs and will shift production to other parts of \nthe world where the environmental standards are not as strict. Instead \nof having the effect of lowering the amount of carbon that seeps into \nour atmosphere, the effect will be the opposite as those developing \nnations allow for production without any environmental controls.\n  Yet, without sound science, without sound economics, and without the \ndeveloping world, some Senators continue to insist that we must \nimplement a cap-and-trade system in the United States.\n  As stated by the Cooler Heads Coalition:\n\n       The risks of global warming are speculative; the risks of \n     global warming policy are all too real.\n\n  The proposal offered by my colleagues from Arizona and Connecticut \nignores the principles expressed in the Byrd-Hagel resolution. Passage \nof their mandatory cap-and-trade proposal will dramatically harm our \neconomy at home without incorporating the developing world. It would \nlead to a drastic increase in transportation costs and home electricity \ncosts. It would be costly for small business owners, and it would cause \nmanufacturers to pay even more than they already do for natural gas.\n  Overall, according to the Independent Energy Information \nAdministration, the Nation's energy costs would increase between $64 \nbillion and $92 billion in 2010, between $152 billion and $214 billion \nby 2020, and between $220 billion and $274 billion in 2025.\n  My constituents simply cannot afford to have us enact such \nlegislation. If we, as a Senate, really want to stand for improving \nglobal conditions, then we need to stand behind the principles of the \nByrd-Hagel Resolution, as we did earlier this afternoon when we voted \nin favor of an amendment offered by the Senator from Nebraska. His \nlegislation took a technology-based approach at home and encouraged the \nspread of the technology to the developing world. It made sound \nenvironmental and economic sense, and I voted in favor of that \nproposal.\n  While I oppose the pending amendment on policy alone, I think it is \nimportant for my colleagues to recognize the overall impact of \nincluding the current amendment in the Energy bill. Passage of this \nproposal has the potential to derail this important legislation. The \nSenate and House versions of the Energy bill are very different, and \neven without a climate change amendment, the conference with the House \nwill be difficult. The addition of a mandatory carbon cap and trade \nprogram could be the poison pill that brings this Energy bill to a \nhalt.\n  Why are we going to risk derailing a comprehensive Energy bill to \nimplement a system that will harm our economy and will have little \neffect on the amount of carbon emissions released into the atmosphere? \nWhy are we moving forward with something when the science behind the \nproposals remains unproven and the models used to prove that science \nremain flawed?\n  We must consider all of these issues as we cast our vote on this \namendment. I will be opposing it, and I will urge other Members to do \nthe same.\n  It is important to note, that although I oppose any attempt to \ninclude a mandatory carbon cap-and-trade program in the Energy bill, I \nstrongly support the overall Energy bill. Comprehensive energy policy \nwill undoubtedly benefit our Nation, and I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues to finally make this legislation a reality.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S6904]]\n\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr President, I recently spoke on the floor about the \nNinth Annual World Congress on Civic Education in Amman, Jordan \nsponsored by the Center for Civic Education. The purpose of that \nconference was to share information about successful education programs \nunder the Civitas: An International Civic Education Exchange Program, \nan authorized program of the No Child Left Behind Act and one which is \nhelping to strengthen democratization efforts throughout the world.\n  A recent news editorial in The Jordan Times supporting the goals of \nthe conference and the outstanding work the Center for Civic Education \nand their international colleagues are doing in this strategic part of \nthe world was welcome support. I ask unanimous consent that the \neditorial from The Jordan Times on Sunday, June 5, 2005, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Jordan Times, Jun. 5, 2005]\n\n                          Civic Responsibility\n\n       Parents, teachers and official policy makers should be \n     keeping a keen eye on an important congress taking place in \n     Amman this week--the World Congress on Civic Education. But \n     more importantly, they, and all citizens should be made aware \n     of the work of the Jordanian Centre for Civic Education \n     Studies (JCCES) and the Arab Civic Education Network (Arab \n     Civitas)\n       In a nutshell, these organisations are teaching our \n     children about being good citizens. They are teaching them \n     about not only their rights as citizens. but also their \n     responsibilities. They are teaching elementary school \n     students to respect the basics of democracy by engaging them, \n     through stories, on the concepts of responsibility, privacy, \n     authority and justice.\n       To many, democracy, and all that it entails, is taken for \n     granted. It never should be.\n       That Jordan brought back an elected Parliament in 1989 was \n     a milestone in the process of the country's democratisation. \n     And while that process has been confronted with obstacles \n     that have contributed to its regression, one arena that can \n     save and enhance it is educatlon.\n       It was therefore encouraging to hear Minister of Education \n     Khalid Touqan address the opening plenary of the congress on \n     behalf of Her Majesty Queen Rania and say that ``efforts are \n     still being exerted to make democracy part of our daily life, \n     in families, schools, public life and mass media.''\n       When the ministry accepted to introduce civic education as \n     a separate subject in the Kingdom's schools, the first big \n     step was taken. Today, the Project Citizen programme, being \n     undertaken in schools as well as universities through the \n     JCCES and Arab Civitas, is preparing generations of civic-\n     minded citizens by educating them and involving them in \n     problem-solving issues affecting their community and society, \n     such as pollution, basic utilities, elections, the jobless \n     rate and taxes. The programme helps instill a sense of \n     community responsibility while educating the students on \n     their rights.\n       It is precisely this sort of awareness that will help \n     motivate citizens to vote for candidates who will fulfil \n     their needs, not tribal members who will perpetuate the \n     culture of ``waste.'' It is precisely this sort of programme \n     that will help guarantee His Majesty King Abdullah's plan to \n     bring local government back to the people and this time have \n     it work.\n       This is why the JCCES and Arab Civitas projects and \n     programmes must be supported and even extended to the larger \n     community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/21/senate-section/article/S6905-4", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6905-S6906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SENATOR JIM EXON\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it's an honor to pay tribute to a great \nman, a distinguished Senator, and a dear friend who passed away on June \n10, Senator Jim Exon of Nebraska.\n  Last week, I joined several of my colleagues in attending his funeral \nin Lincoln, NE. It was inspiring to be with the people who knew him \nbest and loved him most. Jim was a giant in Nebraska politics not \nbecause of the power he wielded but because of the respect and \naffection he had earned.\n  Jim Exon was a decent man, without pretension or prejudice. He spoke \nplainly. He called it like he saw it. He did what he thought was right, \nregardless of the pressure that might have been put on him. Jim laughed \nthe same wonderful, booming laugh with Presidents as he did with the \npeople back home. He was a large man, and he had a heart to match.\n\n[[Page S6906]]\n\n  That is why he was beloved in Nebraska and never lost an election, \nserving two terms as Governor and then three terms as Senator. That is \nwhy he was popular even as the father of the Democratic Party in an \noverwhelmingly Republican State. And that is why his friendship and \nkindness meant the world to me.\n  Jim and I were both members of the class of 1978, and we--and our \nwives--quickly became close friends. We served together on the Armed \nServices Committee; in fact, we sat next to each other for 18 years. We \nhad honest, substantive debates about our defense policy, and I will \nalways cherish the memories of that time. His only interest was the \nsecurity and prosperity of our country and his beloved Nebraska.\n  Jim worked for a strong national defense. He supported responsible \nbudget policies. And he was ahead of his time in warning against \nterrorism and arguing for a Department of Homeland Security. For so \nmany of us, he was a source of wise counsel and trusted advice. With \nJim, you could always be certain he was telling you what he thought was \nright, and he usually was right.\n  We will miss him terribly, but we are fortunate to have had him for \nso long. My thoughts and prayers, and those of my wife Barbara, are \nwith his loving wife Pat and his entire family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/21/senate-section/article/S6906-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n       TYLER L. CREAMEAN, DUSTIN C. FISHER, AND PHILLIP N. SAYLES\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I rise with a heavy heart to honor \nthe lives of three very special Arkansans; Army Specialists Phillip N. \nSayles, Tyler L. Creamean, and Dustin C. Fisher. They will be \nremembered by their family and friends as loving souls who lived their \nlives with energy and passion; they will be remembered by their Nation \nas dedicated soldiers who bravely answered their Nation's call to \nservice and gave their lives in the defense of our freedom.\n  Those who knew Phillip Sayles often spoke of his quiet demeanor and \nthe way he showed determination whenever there was a task at hand, \nfocusing on getting the job done and never complaining. He called the \ncentral Arkansas town of Jacksonville home, and attended nearby North \nPulaski High School. In school, he was active in the ROTC program, \nwhere his leadership skills and discipline quickly distinguished him \nwith the qualities of a soldier. Spc. Sayles transferred to Cabot High \nSchool for his senior year and, upon his graduation in 1997, enlisted \nin the U.S. Army.\n  Despite being born in Texas, Tyler Creamean also spent most of his \nchildhood in Jacksonville. Known for his energy and his light-hearted \nnature, he had a personality that allowed him to make friends with \nnearly everyone he encountered. He was also known for playing pranks \nand causing mischief but did not have a mean bone in his body. Instead, \nhe had a gift for lightening dark moods and bringing a quick smile to \nthe faces of those around him when they needed it most. Spc. Creamean \nattended Jacksonville High School but left after his sophomore year to \njoin the Youth ChalleNGe Program, a 22-week program sponsored by the \nArkansas National Guard to help young adults develop as leaders, earn \ntheir G.E.D. and acquire the skills necessary to succeed in life. It \nwas an opportunity for Spc. Creamean to learn more about himself and \nwhat he wanted in life, and he did just that. He went on to earn the \nprogram's spirit award and shortly after his graduation, he joined the \nArmy in April of 2003.\n  Spc. Sayles and Spc. Creamean were both a part of the Army's 25th \nInfantry Division and spent time at Fort Lewis in Washington prior to \ntheir service in Operation Iraqi Freedom. While in Iraq, Spc. Creamean \nserved with the 73rd Engineer Company and conducted more than 600 \npatrols, sweeping roads for explosive devices and clearing the way so \nthat fellow soldiers as well as Iraqi civilians could pass through \nsafely. In late February, he returned home on leave and on February 24, \nhis 21st birthday, he married the love of his life, his girlfriend \nKaMisha. KaMisha, also a soldier, was stationed at Fort Still, OK, and \nhad begun preparations for her deployment to Iraq. As a result, Spc. \nCreamean now set his sights on reenlistment, so that his new wife would \nnot have to serve in Iraq without him nearby.\n  Dustin Fisher was born in the Northwest Arkansas town of Fort Smith. \nHe spent his childhood as many children do; hanging out with his \nfriends, playing sports, and making life difficult for his sister. He \nwas a fun-loving person who had a gift for story-telling and was always \nquick with a sarcastic remark to lighten a conversation. If looking for \nhim, he could often be found cruising around town in his pink pickup \ntruck, a gift from his father that he used to draw attention and meet \ngirls.\n  Upon his graduation from Van Buren High School in 2001, Spc. Fisher \ntried a year of college but found it was not for him. It became \napparent that he wanted to make something of himself, so he followed \nhis father and brother into military service. Shortly after joining the \nU.S. Army, he was sent down to Fort Stewart, GA. At Fort Stewart, he \nnot only seemed to find his niche in life, but he also met his soul \nmate, a young woman named Alicia. Her presence made him truly happy and \ntwo were married just days before his deployment to Iraq in late \nJanuary.\n  While serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom, Spc. Fisher's mission often \nentailed escorting dignitaries across the war-torn country. Although it \nplaced him in ever-present danger, he downplayed its significance to \ncomfort his family and friends. Although he had originally thought of \nre-enlisting, he now considered returning home to be with Alicia and \npotentially become a firefighter. He had last been home for Christmas, \nand was looking forward to returning for a 2-week leave in late June.\n  Despite the many differences between these three Arkansans, each was \na true soldier in every way. Not only did they share a love for their \ncountry, but they embodied a selfless courage in the name of freedom \nthat continually put them in harm's way. One week in late May would \nensure their fates would forever be intertwined. Early on May 22, while \nroutinely sweeping a stretch of the main highway south of Mosul, Spc. \nCreamean's military vehicle hit a roadside bomb that killed him and a \nfellow soldier. On May 24, while escorting a high-ranking Iraqi \nofficial, Spc. Fisher was one of three soldiers killed when a car bomb \nexploded near their convoy. On May 28, Spc. Sayles was checking for \nweapons in three cars that had been pulled over by American troops in \nMosul. An improvised explosive device was detonated nearby, killing him \nand wounding 21 others; including 13 American troops and 8 Iraqi \ncivilians.\n  Words cannot adequately express the sorrow felt in the hearts of the \nfamilies and loved ones of Phillip Sayles, Tyler Creamean, and Dustin \nFisher, but I pray they can find solace in the courageous way they \nlived their lives. Although they may no longer be with us, their spirit \nwill forever live on in the examples they set and the many lives they \ntouched. My thoughts and prayers go out to their families, their \nfriends, and to all those who knew and loved them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/21/senate-section/article/S6906-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6906-S6907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             NATIVE HAWAIIAN GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about S. 147 the \nNative Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2005. My colleague, \nthe junior Senator from Arizona, for whom I have great respect, has \ninserted several documents written by outside sources into the \nCongressional Record over the past months, criticizing my legislation \nas a racebased measure. I vehemently disagree with his characterization \nof my bill as race-based.\n  We will be debating S. 147 on the floor of the Senate in a few weeks \nand, at that time, we will have a full opportunity to talk about the \nlegislation, which extends the Federal policy of selfgovernance and \nself-determination to Native Hawaiians, Hawaii's indigenous peoples, \nthereby establishing parity in Federal policy toward American Indians, \nAlaska Natives and Native Hawaiians.\n  S. 147 is widely supported in Hawaii. Governor Linda Lingle has \ntestified twice in 4 years in support of this bill. The Hawaii State \nLegislature has passed resolutions in support of Federal recognition \nfor Native Hawaiians in 2000, 2001, and 2005. Resolutions in support \nhave also been passed by the\n\n[[Page S6907]]\n\nAlaska Federation of Natives and National Congress of American Indians. \nFinally, a substantial number of my constituents, Native Hawaiians and \nnon-Native Hawaiians support this bill.\n  In 1993, P.L. 103-150, the Apology Resolution, was enacted into law. \nThe Act provides an apology to Native Hawaiians for the participation \nof U.S. agents in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1893 and \nsets up a process of reconciliation between Native Hawaiians and the \nUnited States. My colleague from Arizona has submitted multiple \narticles criticizing the Apology Resolution and purporting to justify \none of the most painful experiences in Hawaii's history, the overthrow \nof the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1893.\n  I have worked on this bill for the past 6 years with the rest of my \ncolleagues in Hawaii's Congressional delegation. This bill is a step in \nthe right direction for all people of Hawaii because it provides a \nstructured process that will allow us to finally resolve many of the \nlongstanding issues resulting from the overthrow. It is disturbing that \nopponents to the bill rely so heavily on mischaracterizations of the \nlegislation to advocate their position.\n  I stand by Hawaii's history as enacted in P.L. 103-150. The facts as \ncited are well-documented by historians.

Mr. President, I rise today to mark the 33rd \nanniversary of the enactment of title IX, a law that has opened doors \nto educational opportunities for countless women and girls across \nAmerica.\n  Prior to passing title IX, roughly 295,000 girls participated in high \nschool sports, and only about 25,000 played sports at the college \nlevel. When President Nixon signed the educational amendments of 1972 \ninto law 33 years ago, skeptics claimed the law would do little to \nchange women's participation in sports.\n  They could not have been more wrong. Recent data show that nearly 2.6 \nmillion high school girls and over 135,000 women in college participate \nin organized sports, constituting more than 40 percent of all high \nschool athletes.\n  In Washington State, women at public colleges and universities \nrepresented less than one-third of most schools' athletes less than 15 \nyears ago. Today, women represent 48 percent of athletes at public \ninstitutions of higher education in our State. As the numbers of girls \nparticipating in sports has increased, there has been a decrease in the \nnumber of girls who drop out of school, smoke, drink alcohol or have \nunwanted pregnancies. What's more, adolescent girls that participate in \norganized sports enjoy improved physical and mental health throughout \ntheir lives.\n  Today, 1 in every 2.5 girls participates in athletics, which is an \n800-percent increase in participation rates since the enactment of \ntitle IX. Yet attempts to weaken title IX persist. Last March, the \nDepartment of Education issued a policy guidance that would weaken \nTitle IX. The new clarification would allow institutions to avoid \noffering sports opportunities to women if a sufficient number of the \nstudent body failed to respond to an e-mail survey expressing interest \nin the program. This allows universities to use what may be highly \nquestionable, potentially inaccurate e-mail survey results to prove \nthat the interests and abilities of the underrepresented sex have been \naccommodated, as title IX requires.\n  I am deeply concerned that this policy guidance represents the \ncurrent administration's repeated attempts to diminish the enforcement \nof this very important law and believe that e-mail surveys will likely \nunderestimate the need to expand athletic opportunities for women. The \ngrowth of opportunity for women and girls should not hang on the \noutcome of such informal means of data collection.\n  Our Nation has taken great strides toward equity, and title IX has \nplayed a significant role in that success. Millions of girls have \naccess to opportunities that their mothers never knew. However, there \nis still much to be done before we can say that males and females are \ntreated equability in education. Further progress hinges on our \ncontinued commitment to the principles of title IX and proper \nenforcement of the law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/21/senate-section/article/S6907-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    GENERAL BERNARD ADOLPH SCHRIEVER\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, it is with deep sorrow that I come to \nspeak on the floor of the Senate today. The father of the United States \nAir Force space and missile program, General Bernard Adolph Schriever, \ndied today of natural causes. He is survived by his wife, his three \nchildren, and his two step-children. I offer them my deepest \ncondolences and prayers as they go through this difficult time.\n  General Schriever was a great American. Born in Bremen, Germany in \n1910, Schriever's family moved to America 7 years later, where he \nbecame a naturalized citizen in 1923. Schriever would give 33 years of \ndistinguished military service to his new home.\n  During his exceptional career in the Air Force, General Schriever led \nAmerica's charge into space. When President Dwight Eisenhower assigned \nthe Nation's highest priority to the development of an Inter-\nContinental Ballistic Missile, the Air Force assigned Schriever to \nmanage the program. He demanded sweeping authority to accomplish the \njob, authority that Schriever's commander gladly granted him.\n  The success of the ballistic missile and space programs managed by \nSchriever was phenomenal. The progression of the Thor Intermediate \nRange Ballistic Missile, from program approval to the Initial \nOperational Capability, took only 3\\1/2\\ years. The Atlas's development \ntime was little more than 5 years, and the Titan's less than 6. \nMoreover, even as the first Titan lifted off from Cape Canaveral, \nSchriever's group was already developing the more advanced Titan II.\n  The Minuteman, from start to finish, took only 4 years and 8 months \nto deploy. The first ten were on combat alert in their underground \nsilos in October of 1962. Schriever's organization could rightfully \ntake credit for winning the Cold War's race for missile supremacy, \nhelping to ensure America's safety and security in perilous times.\n  Schriever had assembled an organization with the highest educational \nlevel of any U.S. military organization either before or since that \ntime. More than a third of his hand-picked officers had Ph.D.s and \nMaster's degrees. Schriever believed that America had to develop its \nmind power if the country was to survive in the space age, a belief we \nwould be well served to listen to today.\n  General Schriever's legacy lives on in the men and women of Schriever \nAir Force Base in Colorado Springs. The more than 3,400 military and \ncivilian employees continue to provide our Nation with an aerospace \ncapability second to none. The base flies nearly all of the Department \nof Defense's satellites.\n  Colorado is proud of the men and women who serve at Schriever Air \nForce Base, and we are proud of the legacy left to us by General \nBernard Adolph Schriever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/21/senate-section/article/S6907-3", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6907-S6908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     CHAMBER OF COMMERCE MILESTONES\n\n Mr. ALLEN.

Mr. President, today I would like to pay \ntribute to a very special group of people in my home State who will \nsoon celebrate an important 1-year anniversary.\n  Deep in the heart of Georgia, right in the middle of my former House \ndistrict, a small Congregational Methodist Church has been ministering \nto the people in their community for more than 150 years. This small \ntown church is making a big difference in many lives across my State. \nSince 1852, this group of Christians has faithfully gathered each \nSunday in the halls of a humble church building to worship God and seek \nHis guidance for their lives.\n  It is clear that God has heard and answered their prayers. One year \nago, under the leadership of my good friend of Dr. Benny Tate, Rock \nSprings Church in Milner opened the doors to their new sanctuary--a \nroom that seats more than double that of the previous sanctuary. The \nnew sanctuary has equipped this thriving church with the tools they \nneed to minister to even more folks than ever in the long life of this \nchurch.\n  I am personally encouraged by the dedication of this congregation to \ndo whatever it takes to see that they could provide a place of worship \nfor the growing number of people attending Sunday services.\n  As the son of a minister, I spent my youth traveling across the \nsoutheast, as my dad served in the Episcopal Church. I know first hand \nthe challenges of church leadership and the joys of seeing God answer \nprayers.\n  Dr. Tate, known by his friends as Pastor Benny, has demonstrated \nremarkable vision and direction as the head pastor of Rock Springs \nChurch. My wife Julianne and I have had the opportunity to attend Rock \nSprings Church as Pastor Benny's guests on ``Friend Day'' and the \nparishioners there always make us feel welcome.\n  I am proud to recognize my friends at Rock Springs Church in \ncelebration of this momentous occasion and encourage each new member to \nreflect on the offerings and sacrifice on the part of those faithful \nfew who helped make this new sanctuary a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/21/senate-section/article/S6908-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LIBRARY OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, it is with the greatest pleasure \nthat I rise today to honor the Fayetteville Public Library which was \nrecently named the 2005 ``Library of the Year'' by Thompson Gale and \nLibrary Journal. The Library of the Year Award honors the library that \nis most dedicated to community service through its creativity and \nleadership. Thompson Gale and Library Journal will present a check for \n$10,000 to the Fayetteville Public Library later this month during the \nAmerican Library Association's annual conference in Chicago, IL.\n  I would like to recognize Louise Schapter, Executive Director of the \nFayetteville Public Library, and her outstanding staff for their \ncommitment to providing such a quality community resource to the \ncitizens of Northwest Arkansas. During Ms. Schapter's tenure, library \nusage has soared. Visits have increased from 192,179 to 576,773, \ncheckouts have risen from 271,187 to 718,159, program attendance has \ngrown from 14,448 to 41,658, and cardholders have leaped from 15,662 to \n48,419. What a remarkable accomplishment!\n  I would also like to mention that the library has more than 160 \nregular volunteers who deliver books to the homebound, shelve and cover \nbooks, staff the computer lab and conduct various programs. This \ninvolvement by the community is truly commendable and makes all of us \nin Arkansas proud.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the Fayetteville \nPublic Library on receiving this well-deserved honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/21/senate-section/article/S6908-3", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SOO LOCKS\n\n Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, this year marks the 150th \nanniversary of one of our Nation's most visionary engineering feats--\nthe construction of the world famous Soo Locks at Sault Ste. Marie, MI. \nThe Soo Locks shaped the course of our Nation's history and have become \na key part of Michigan's cultural heritage. There will be a grand \ncelebration on Engineers Day, June 24, to kick off a summer of special \nevents in commemoration of this significant anniversary.\n  The St. Mary's River is the connection between Lake Superior and the \nother Great Lakes. The challenge with this natural link is the 21-foot \ndrop in elevation between Lake Superior and the lower lakes which \ncreates the St. Mary's Rapids. Early traders were forced to unload \ntheir cargo, haul it around the rapids by land, and then reload it into \nother boats. And if it wasn't for the vision of three men, Alpheus \nFelch, Pierre Barbeau, and James P. Pendill, we might still be using \nthe same shipping methods today.\n  The story of the Soo Locks really begins in 1850 when two Senators \nfrom Michigan, Lewis Cass and Alpheus Felch, realized the need for a \nlarge-scale lock system at the Soo in order to transport iron ore from \nMichigan Hills to the mills in Pennsylvania and Ohio. As a former \ngovernor of Michigan, Senator Felch took charge of the project. He met \nwith Mayor Pierre Barbeau and the two convinced the people of the Soo \nto vote to build the locks. Now that they had the public's support, \nthey needed the materials for construction. The lumber for this \nambitious project was provided by James Pendill, who owned the land \nthat would be later gifted to the American public as Hiawatha National \nForest. Construction began in 1853 and a system of two 350-foot locks \nwas designated. The State locks opened in 1855.\n  It soon became clear that the State lock and canal were of national \nimportance for commerce. In 1881, the locks were transferred to the \nUnited States Army Corps of Engineers. The Corps operates and maintains \nthe locks to this day. The lock system gives safe passage to a variety \nof ships and creates the major artery for shipping and trade in the \nGreat Lakes.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in honoring and celebrating \nthe Sesquicentennial of the Soo Locks and the vision of the people of \nMichigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/21/senate-section/article/S6908-4", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO McCROSSAN BOYS RANCH\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to strengthen Federal leadership, provide grants, \nenhance outreach and guidance, and provide other support to State and \nlocal officials to achieve communications inter-operability, to foster \nimproved regional collaboration and coordination, to promote more \nefficient utilization of funding devoted to public safety \ncommunications, to promote research and development for first responder \ncommunications, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n\n[[Page S6912]]\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \ndesigned to finally address one of the most long-standing and difficult \nproblems facing our Nation's first responders--the lack of \ncommunications interoperability.\n  I want to thank Chairman Collins of the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, Senator Levin and Senator Akaka for \njoining me in this effort.\n  I don't want to be confused with the evil road captain in ``Cool Hand \nLuke,'' but there is only one way to say this: ``What we have here is a \nfailure to communicate!''\n  By now, we all know that the inability of first responders to talk to \none another when responding to emergencies costs lives during terrorist \nattacks or natural disasters. According to the 9/11 Commission, the \nlack of interoperability contributed to the deaths of more than 100 \nfire fighters in New York on 9/11.\n  However, this failure to communicate also creates problems during \nevery day emergency operations, endangering both first responders and \nthe public while also wasting precious resources. For example, when law \nenforcement officers cannot communicate effectively about a suspect \nfleeing across jurisdictions, criminals can escape.\n  It is past time we fixed this problem.\n  Achieving interoperability is the top priority for State homeland \nsecurity advisors. It is essential for first responders to achieve the \nnational preparedness goals that the Department of Homeland Security \nhas established for the Nation.\n  However, for most States obtaining the equipment and technology to \nfulfill this goal remains a challenge. And a major hurdle continues to \nbe lack of sufficient funding. A non-partisan task force of the Council \non Foreign Relations recommended spending at least $6.8 billion over \nfive years. DHS has also estimated the cost of modernizing equipment \nfor 2.5 million public safety first responders across the country at \n$40 billion.\n  I am convinced that we can achieve interoperability for much less--\nbut only if strong national leadership drives cooperation and adoption \nof smart new technology solutions.\n  Achieving interoperability is difficult because some 50,000 local \nagencies typically make independent decisions about communications \nsystems. The result is that first responders typically operate on \ndifferent radio systems, at different frequencies, unable to \ncommunicate with one another.\n  Strong national leadership is necessary to ensure that different \njurisdictions come together to work out the often complex issues that \nprevent interoperability in the first place.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will provide this much \nneeded Federal leadership and provide dedicated grants, enhance \ntechnical assistance to State and local first responders, promote \ngreater regional cooperation, and foster the research and development \nnecessary to make achieving interoperability a realistic national goal.\n  The ``Improve Interoperable Communications for First Responders Act \nof 2005'' or the ICOM Act for short, gets us there in three distinct \nways.\n  First, the ICOM Act will provide the Office of Interoperability and \nCompatibility (OIC) within DHS the resources and authorities necessary \nto systematically overcome the barriers to achieving interoperability.\n  ICOM requires OIC to conduct extensive, nationwide outreach and \nfacilitate the creation of task forces in each State to develop \ninteroperable solutions. It requires coordinated and extensive \ntechnical assistance through the Office of Domestic Preparedness' \nInteroperable Communications Technical Assistance Program. OIC will \nalso be charged with developing a national strategy and national \narchitecture so that we systematically move towards a truly national \nsystem of public safety communications.\n  This Act authorizes OIC to fund and conduct pilot programs to \nevaluate and validate new technology concepts needed to encourage more \nefficient use of spectrum and other resources and deploy less costly \npublic safety communications systems.\n  Second, the ICOM Act will identify and answer the policy and \ntechnology questions necessary to achieve interoperability by requiring \nthe Secretary to establish a comprehensive, competitive research and \ndevelopment program.\n  This research agenda will focus on: understanding the strengths and \nweaknesses of today's diverse public safety communications systems; \nexamining how current and emerging technology can make public safety \norganizations more effective, and how local, State, and Federal \nagencies can utilize this technology in a coherent and cost-effective \nmanner; evaluating and validating new technology concepts; and \nadvancing the creation of a national strategy to promote \ninteroperability and efficient use of spectrum.\n  The legislation authorizes some $126 million for each of fiscal years \n2006 through 2009 for the operations of the Office for Interoperability \nand Compatibility so DHS can finally provide the national leadership \nnecessary to achieve interoperability in the most cost effective \nmanner; for research and development; and to provide enhanced technical \nassistance to state and local officials around the country.\n  Third, the ICOM Act will provide consistent, dedicated funding by \nauthorizing $3.3 billion over five years for initiatives to achieve \nshort-term or long-term solutions to interoperability. It authorizes \ngrants directly to States or regional consortium within each State to \nbe used specifically for key aspects of the communications life-cycle, \nincluding: State-wide or regional communications planning; system \ndesign and engineering; procurement and installation of equipment; \ntraining and exercises; or other activities determined by the Secretary \nto be integral to the achievement of this essential capability.\n  The bill adopts the same formula for distributing funds in S. 21, the \nHomeland Security Grants Enhancement Act as reported by the Homeland \nSecurity and Government Affairs Committee. Each State will receive a \nminimum baseline amount of 0.55 percent of the total funds appropriated \nunder the bill. States that are larger/and or more densely populated \nreceive a higher baseline amount, based on a formula that combines \npopulation and population density.\n  The remaining funds--over 60 percent of the total--will be \ndistributed based on additional threat and risk-based factors. This \nwill ensure that the majority of funds are distributed to those areas \nat highest risk, while we systematically ensure that this very basic \ncommunications capability is built in every state across our country.\n  The Secretary will be required to establish a panel of technical \nexperts, first responders, and other State and local officials, to \nreview and make recommendations on grant applications.\n  This legislation also promotes regional cooperation, consistent with \nthe National Preparedness Goal, which identifies the essential \ncapabilities States and localities need to fight the war on terrorism, \nrewarding those jurisdictions that join together in robust regional \nbodies to apply for funds.\n  Most importantly, this dedicated funding program for interoperability \nwill ensure that jurisdictions can receive and rely on a consistent \nstream of funding for vital interoperability projects, without also \nbeing forced to neglect all of the other essential capabilities DHS has \nsaid they need to develop.\n  This legislation is crucial for the safety of our citizens and the \nmen and women who go to work everyday pledged to protect them. It will \nensure that, for the first time, achieving communications \ninteroperability is an achievable national goal, a genuine national \npriority.\n  To win the war on terrorism and protect the American people, we \ncannot have a failure to communicate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1274\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Improve Interoperable \n     Communications for First Responders Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n\n[[Page S6913]]\n\n       (1) A major barrier to sharing information among police, \n     firefighters, and others who may be called on to respond to \n     terrorist attacks and other large-scale emergencies is the \n     lack of interoperable communications systems, which can \n     enable public safety agencies to talk to one another and \n     share important, sometimes critical, information in an \n     emergency.\n       (2) Communications interoperability has been identified by \n     the Department of Homeland Security as 1 of the most \n     essential capabilities necessary for first responders to \n     achieve the national preparedness goal the Department of \n     Homeland Security has established for the Nation.\n       (3) The lack of interoperability costs lives during \n     terrorist attacks or natural disasters, but also during \n     everyday emergency operations.\n       (4) Achieving interoperability is difficult because some \n     50,000 local agencies typically make independent decisions \n     about communications systems. This lack of coordination also \n     dramatically increases the cost of public safety \n     communications to Federal, State, local, and tribal \n     governments\n       (5) Achieving the level of communications interoperability \n     that is needed will require an unprecedented level of \n     coordination and cooperation among Federal, State, local, and \n     tribal public safety agencies. Establishing \n     multidisciplinary, cross-jurisdictional governance structures \n     to achieve the necessary level of collaboration is essential \n     to accomplishing this goal.\n       (6) The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of \n     2004 requires the Secretary of Homeland Security, in \n     consultation with other Federal officials, to establish a \n     program to ensure public safety interoperable communications \n     at all levels of government.\n       (7) However, much more remains to be done. For example, in \n     January 2005, the National Governors Association reported \n     that while achieving interoperability ranked as the top \n     priority for States, obtaining the equipment and technology \n     to fulfill this goal remains a challenge. The large majority \n     of States report that they have not yet achieved \n     interoperability in their States.\n       (8) Over 70 percent of public safety communications \n     equipment is still analog, rather than digital. In fact, much \n     of the communications equipment used by emergency responders \n     is outdated and incompatible, which inhibits communication \n     between State and local governments and between neighboring \n     local jurisdictions. Additional grant funding would \n     facilitate the acquisition of new technology to enable \n     interoperability.\n       (9) Stronger and more effective national, statewide, and \n     regional leadership are required to improve interoperability. \n     The Department of Homeland Security must provide national \n     leadership by conducting nationwide outreach to each State, \n     fostering the development of regional leadership, and \n     providing substantial technical assistance to State, local, \n     and tribal public safety officials, while more effectively \n     utilizing grant programs that fund interoperable equipment \n     and systems.\n       (10) The Department of Homeland Security must implement \n     pilot programs and fund and conduct research to develop and \n     promote adoption of next-generation solutions for public \n     safety communications. The Department of Homeland Security \n     must also further develop its own internal expertise to \n     enable it to better lead national interoperability efforts \n     and to provide technically sound advice to State and local \n     officials.\n       (11) Achieving interoperability requires the sustained \n     commitment of substantial resources. A non-partisan task \n     force of the Council on Foreign Relations recommended \n     spending at least $6,800,000,000 over 5 years towards \n     achieving interoperability. The Department of Homeland \n     Security has estimated the cost of modernizing first-\n     responder equipment for the 2,500,000 public safety first \n     responders across the country at $40,000,000,000.\n       (12) Communications interoperability can be accomplished at \n     a much lower cost if strong national leadership drives \n     cooperation and adoption of smart, new technology solutions.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my good friend, \nthe Senator from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, in introducing the \nImprove Interoperable Communications for First Responders Act of 2005. \nThis legislation will strengthen our capabilities to prevent and \nrespond to acts of terrorism. The bill we are introducing will improve \ncommunications among the various levels of government and will assist \nour State and local first responders in upgrading their communications \nequipment. I thank Senator Lieberman for his efforts in putting \ntogether this very important legislation and for working with me to \nmake this bill a bipartisan effort.\n  According to the 9/11 Commission Report, interoperability--the \nability for emergency responders to communicate with one another during \nan incident--was a serious problem on 9/11. On that fateful day, the \nNYPD Emergency Service Unit did manage to successfully convey \nevacuation instructions to personnel in the North Tower after the South \nTower's collapse. This was accomplished by a combination of ``1. the \nstrength of the radios, 2. the relatively small numbers of individuals \nusing them, and 3. use of the correct channel by all.'' On the other \nhand, the 9/11 Commission Report pointed out that ``the same three \nfactors worked against successful communication among FDNY personnel. \nFirst, the radios' effectiveness was drastically reduced in the high-\nrise environment. Second, tactical channel 1 was simply overwhelmed by \nthe numbers of units attempting to communicate on it at 10:00 a.m. \nThird, some firefighters were on the wrong channel or simply lacked \nradios altogether.''\n  In addition, a Government Accountability Office report on \ninteroperable communications released in June 2004 notes that the lives \nof first responders and those they are trying to assist can be lost \nwhen first responders cannot communicate effectively. That is the crux \nof the matter that the Lieberman-Collins bill seeks to address. A \nsubstantial barrier to effective communications, according to the GAO, \nis the use of incompatible wireless equipment by many agencies and \nlevels of government when they are responding to a major emergency. \nFrom computer systems to emergency radios, the technology that should \nallow these different levels of government to communicate with each \nother too often is silenced by incompatibility. Clearly, the barrier to \na truly unified effort against terrorism is a matter of both culture \nand equipment. This legislation will help break down that barrier.\n  The GAO recommends that Federal grants be used to encourage States to \ndevelop and implement plans to improve interoperable communications and \nthat the Department of Homeland Security should establish a long-term \nprogram to coordinate these same communications upgrades throughout the \nFederal Government. Our legislation would do much to implement these \nsensible recommendations.\n  The National Governors Association recently released a survey of \nState and territorial homeland security advisors to determine their top \n10 priorities and challenges facing states in the future. The number \none priority was achieving interoperability in communications.\n  One of the most persistent messages that I hear from Maine's first \nresponders is strong concern about the lack of compatibility in \ncommunications equipment. It remains a substantial impediment to their \nability to respond effectively in the event of a terrorist attack. For \na State like mine that has the largest port by tonnage in New England, \ntwo international airports, key defense installations, hundreds of \nmiles of coastline, and a long international border, compatible \ncommunications equipment is essential. Yet it remains an illusive goal.\n  Maine's firefighters, police officers, and emergency medical \npersonnel do an amazing job in providing aid when a neighboring town is \nin need. Fires, floods, and accidents are local matters in which they \nhave great expertise and experience. Their work on the front lines in \nthe war against terrorism is, however, a joint responsibility. Maine's \nfirst responders, along with first responders across the country, are \ndoing their part, but they need and deserve Federal help.\n  It is vitally important that we assist the States in getting the \nright communications technology into the hands of their first \nresponders. That would be accomplished by the interoperability grant \nprogram in this legislation. The grant program guarantees every state a \nshare of interoperability funding and makes additional funding \navailable for states with special needs and vulnerabilities. It is \ndesigned to get this vital funding to first responders quickly, in \ncoordination with a statewide plan.\n  A recent study by the Council on Foreign Relations estimates the \ntotal cost of nationwide communications compatibility at $6.8 billion.\n  Our legislation authorizes a total of $3.3 billion over a 5 year \nperiod for grants dedicated to achieving communications \ninteroperability. That is a reasonable and necessary contribution by \nthe Federal Government to this important partnership.\n  The legislation will also help to identify and answer the policy and \ntechnology questions necessary to achieve interoperability. It directs \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security to establish a comprehensive, \ncompetitive research and development program. This includes conducting \nresearch through the Directorate of Science and Technology Homeland \nSecurity Advanced Research Projects Agency, (HSARPA) and establishing a \nCenter of Excellence focused on enhancing information and\n\n[[Page S6916]]\n\ncommunications systems for first responders.\n  The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2002, P.L. \n108-458, which Senator Lieberman and I authored, directs the Office for \nInteroperability and Compatibility (OIC) in DHS to provide overall \nfederal leadership to achieve interoperability. Our legislative \ninitiative builds on this current policy by providing the OIC the \nresources and authorities necessary to conduct extensive, nationwide \noutreach, develop a national strategy and national architecture, and \nconduct pilot programs to evaluate and validate new technology \nconcepts.\n  We must all work together to achieve interoperability for all our \nfirst responders. Coordination and cooperation among all stakeholders \nwill be imperative if the brave men and women who risk their lives on a \ndaily basis are to be fully prepared.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this legislation to \nbuild a better and stronger homeland security partnership with our \nfirst responders.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in introducing the \nImprove Interoperable Communications For First Responders, or ``ICOM,'' \nAct of 2005. We have all heard the stories of how the first responders \ncould not communicate on 9/11 and this lack of communication cost \nlives. The same situation is happening all over this country and we \nneed to improve interoperable communications before more lives are \nlost. Attaining this objective will require substantial resources and a \nstrong commitment by Congress and the Administration. This legislation \ntakes an important first step in this effort.\n  We have seen how bad the problem is in Michigan. For example, on the \nmorning of Sunday, October 26, 2003, Michigan first responders held an \nexercise to test the emergency communications response capabilities at \nMichigan's international border with Canada. As we all know, during any \nemergency, effective communications is an absolute requirement. \nHowever, during the exercise, in order to communicate between fire \nagencies, the fire commanding officer needed 3 portable radios \nliterally hanging around his neck and hooked to his waist band to \nattempt scene coordination. The Incident Commander was shuffling radios \nup and down to his ear and mouth in an attempt to figure out ``who'' \nwas requesting or providing information. Further, the fire commanding \nofficer had no communication with any law enforcement or Emergency \nMedical Service agencies. To communicate with those agencies, 5 \nadditional radios would be required. This is totally unacceptable.\n  First and foremost, the ICOM Act will provide dedicated funding for \ninitiatives to achieve short- and long-term solutions to \ninteroperability to States or regional consortia within each State for \nState-wide or regional communications planning, system design and \nengineering, procurement and installation of equipment, training and \nexercises, or other activities determined by the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity to be integral to the achievement of communications \ninteroperability.\n  This legislation will also provide the recently authorized Office for \nInteroperability and Compatibility the resources and authorities \nnecessary to conduct extensive, nationwide outreach, develop a national \nstrategy, facilitate the creation of regional task forces in each \nState, fund and conduct pilot programs to evaluate and validate new \ntechnology concepts, encourage more efficient use of resources, and \ntest and deploy more reliable and less costly public safety \ncommunications systems. Finally, the ICOM Act also requires the \nSecretary of Homeland Security to establish a comprehensive, \ncompetitive research and development program. This includes promoting \nresearch through the Directorate of Science and Technology and Homeland \nSecurity Advanced Research Projects Agency, and considering \nestablishing a Center of Excellence. The research agenda will focus on \nunderstanding the strengths and weaknesses of today's diverse public \nsafety communications systems, examining how current and emerging \ntechnology can make public safety organizations more effective, and how \nlocal, State, and Federal agencies can utilize this technology in a \ncoherent and cost-effective manner, evaluating and validating new \ntechnology concepts, and advancing the creation of a national strategy \nto promote interoperability and efficient use of spectrum.\n  I recently authored an amendment that passed the Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs Committee that would assist our first \nresponders by creating demonstration projects at our northern and \nsouthern borders. The ICOM Act will complement that legislation by \nproviding funding, support, research and development to improve \ninteroperable communications on a national level.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, \nSenators Lieberman, Collins, and Levin, in introducing the Improve \nInteroperable Communications for First Responders Act of 2005 (the ICOM \nAct), which will strengthen the interoperability of first responder \ncommunications across the country.\n  Since September 11, Federal, State, and local authorities have \ngrappled with the challenge of achieving interoperable communications \nfor emergency response personnel. This should not be a difficult task \nsince the necessary technology exists. But as with many public policy \nchallenges, achieving interoperability comes down to organization and \nfunding.\n  The 9-11 Commission found that the inability of first responders to \ncommunicate at the three September 11 crash sites demonstrated ``that \ncompatible and adequate communications among public safety \norganizations at the local, State, and Federal levels remains a \nimportant problem.'' In my home State of Hawaii, for example, first \nresponders are unable to communicate by radio over 25 percent of the \nIsland of Hawaii because of inadequate infrastructure and diverse \ngeography. The Commission recommended that federal funding of local \ninteroperability programs be given a high priority.\n  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) estimated it would cost $40 \nbillion to modernize communications equipment for the Nation's 2.5 \nmillion public safety first responders. In 2003, an independent task \nforce sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations recommended \ninvesting $6.8 billion over five years to ensure dependable, \ninteroperable first responder communications, a need which they \ndescribe as ``so central to any kind of terrorist attack response.''\n  However, funding alone will not solve this urgent problem. The \nGovernment Accountability Office (GAO) has found that DHS leadership is \ncritical to utilizing effectively interoperability technologies. In an \nApril 2005 report, ``Technology Assessment: Protecting Structures and \nImproving Communications during Wildland Fires,'' GAO stated that even \nif two neighboring jurisdictions have the funding to purchase an \ninterconnection device, such as an audio switch, organizational \nchallenges remain. GAO stated, ``To effectively employ the device, they \nmust also jointly decide how to share its cost, ownership, and \nmanagement; agree on the operating procedures for when and how to \ndeploy it; and train individuals to configure, maintain, and use it.'' \nAchieving such planning and coordination will require federal \nleadership.\n  According to GAO, the federal government has increased \ninteroperability planning and coordination efforts in recent years. \nHowever the Wireless Public Safety Interoperable Communications Program \n(SAFECOM), which is run out of the Office for Interoperability and \nCompatibility (OIC) in DHS, has made limited progress in achieving \ncommunications interoperability among entities at all levels of \ngovernment.\n  The ICOM Act will increase federal coordination and provide dedicated \nfunding for interoperability. Our bill will increase the resources and \nauthority of the OIC, which was established by the Intelligence Reform \nand Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. Specifically, the OIC will be \ntasked with creating a national strategy and national architecture, \nfacilitating the creation of regional task forces, and conducting pilot \nprograms to evaluate new technology concepts. The OIC will be \nresponsible not only for short-term solutions, but also for \nsimultaneously pursuing a long-term interoperability\n\n[[Page S6917]]\n\nstrategy, something that has been lacking from Federal efforts to date.\n  The ICOM Act will also create an interoperability grant program and \nauthorize $3.3 billion over five years for the program. Recognizing \nthat achieving interoperability is crucial to every State's emergency \nresponse capabilities, the bill gives each State a baseline amount of \n.55 percent of the funding.\n  The ICOM Act also requires the Secretary to look to at the unique \ngeographic barriers in each State which may impede interoperability \nwhen awarding grants. This is key to States like Hawaii that may \nrequire additional transmitter towers and other types of equipment to \novercome the obstacles that come with being a mountainous or island \nState.\n  Last year, I joined Senators Lieberman and Collins in introducing S. \n2701, the Homeland Security Interagency and Interjurisdictional \nInformation Sharing Act of 2004. Many of the provisions in S. 2701 were \nincorporated into the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act. \nHowever, there still continue to be problems in terms of leadership and \nfunding in federal interoperability policy. I ask my colleagues to not \nwait another year to begin to fill this hole. I urge support of this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS (for himself and Ms. Murkowski):\n  S. 1275. A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 7172 North Tongass Highway, Ward Cove, Alaska, as \nthe `Alice R. Brusich Post Office Building'; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send to the desk legislation to \ndesignate the U.S. Post Office located at 7172 North Tongass Highway in \nWard Cove, AK after Alice R. Brusich.\n  Alice Brusich started her career with the Postal Service in 1954 as \nan Assistant Postmaster. Through her hard work and efforts, she became \nPostmaster in 1956.\n  During her service with the Postal Service, Alice was also one of the \nfounders of the Tongass Community Club. She was also one of the \nfounding members and top officer of the Alaska Chapter 51 National \nAssociation of Postmasters in the United States.\n  Alice was also in charge of the Ketchikan Post Office in the 70's. In \n1985, Alice retired after 31 years of service. She remains an active \nsupporter of the Postal service and is dedicated to improving the \nservices at the Ward Cove Post Office. Alice has always been a strong \nadvocate of improving and maintaining the Postal Service in Alaska, and \nit is only appropriate that we honor her service by dedicating the Ward \nCove Post Office after her.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Corzine, \n        Mr. Jeffords, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n        Dayton, and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 1278. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nprovide a mechanism for United States citizens and lawful permanent \nresidents to sponsor their permanent partners for residence in the \nUnited States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Today I am introducing the Uniting American Families Act. \nThis legislation would allow U.S. citizens and legal permanent \nresidents to petition for their foreign same-sex partners to come to \nthe United States under our family immigration system. It is nearly \nidentical to the Permanent Partners Immigration Act that I introduced \nin the last Congress, and which Congressman Nadler--who is introducing \nthis bill in the House today--has sponsored for the last four \nCongresses. I am pleased to have Senators Chafee, Kennedy, Corzine, \nJeffords, Boxer, Feingold, Murray, Dayton, and Lautenberg as \ncosponsors.\n  Under current law, committed partners of Americans are unable to use \nthe family immigration system, which accounts for about 75 percent of \nthe green cards and immigrant visas granted annually by the United \nStates. As a result, gay Americans who are in this situation must \neither live apart from their partners, or leave the country if they \nwant to live legally and permanently with them.\n  This bill rectifies that problem while retaining strong prohibitions \nagainst fraud. To qualify as a permanent partner, petitioners must \nprove that they are at least 18 and are in a committed, intimate \nrelationship with another adult in which both parties intend a lifelong \ncommitment, and are financially interdependent with one's partner. They \nmust also prove that they are not married to, or in a permanent \npartnership with, anyone other than that person, and are unable to \ncontract with that person a marriage cognizable under the Immigration \nand Nationality Act. Proof could include sworn affidavits from friends \nand family and documentation of financial interdependence. Penalties \nfor fraud would be the same as penalties for marriage fraud--up to five \nyears in prison and $250,000 in fines for the U.S. citizen partner, and \ndeportation for the alien partner.\n  There are Vermonters who are involved in permanent partnerships with \nforeign nationals and who have felt abandoned by our laws in this area. \nThis bill would allow them--and other gay and lesbian Americans \nthroughout our Nation who have come to feel that our immigration laws \nare discriminatory--to be a fuller part of our society.\n  The idea that immigration benefits should be extended to same-sex \ncouples has become increasingly prevalent around the world. Indeed, \nsixteen nations--Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, \nFrance, Germany, Iceland, Israel, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, \nSouth Africa, Sweden and the United Kingdom--recognize same-sex couples \nfor immigration purposes.\n  Our immigration laws treat gays and lesbians in committed \nrelationships as second-class citizens, and that needs to change.

A bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 2006 and \n2007 for the United States Coast Guard, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Coast \nGuard Authorization Act of 2005.\n  The Coast Guard serves as the guardian of our maritime homeland \nsecurity and provides many critical services for our Nation. Last year \nalone, the Coast Guard responded to over 32,000 calls for assistance, \nand saved 5,500 lives. These brave men and women risk their lives to \ndefend our borders from drugs, illegal immigrants, acts of terror, and \nother national security threats. In 2004, the Coast Guard seized \n376,000 pounds of illegal narcotics, preventing them from reaching our \nstreets and playgrounds. They also stopped over 11,000 illegal migrants \nfrom reaching our shores. In addition they conducted 4,500 boardings to \nprotect our vital fisheries stocks and they responded to 23,904 \npollution incidents.\n  In today's post-9/11 world, the men and women of the Coast Guard have \nbeen working harder than ever securing the nation's coastline, \nwaterways, and ports. This rapid escalation of the Coast Guard's \nhomeland security mission catalogue continues today. Last year alone, \nthe Coast Guard aggressively defended our homeland by conducting more \nthan 36,000 port security patrols, boarded over 19,000 vessels, \nescorted over 7,200 vessels, and maintained more than 115 security \nzones. While our new reality requires the Coast Guard to maintain a \nrobust homeland security posture, these new priorities must not \ndiminish the Coast Guard's focus on its traditional missions such as \nmarine safety, search and rescue, aids to navigation, fisheries law \nenforcement, and marine environmental protection.\n  By introducing the Coast Guard Authorization bill today, I intend to \ncontinue giving the Coast Guard my full support, and I hope my \ncolleagues will work with me to provide the Coast Guard with the \nresources it needs to carry out its many critically important missions \nthat it provides to this Nation. Unfortunately, the Coast Guard's rapid \noperational escalation has come on the backs of its 42,000 men and \nwomen who faithfully serve our country. Additionally, it has taken a \nsignificant toll on the ships, boats, and aircraft that the Coast Guard \nuses on a daily basis. I believe we need to shift this burden off our \npeople and instead adequately provide the Coast Guard with the \nresources it needs, primarily through the full support of its \nrecapitalization project known as Deepwater.\n  The bill I introduce today would authorize funding at $8.2 billion \nfor Fiscal Year 2006 and $8.8 billion for Fiscal Year 2007. This \nrepresents an 8 percent annual budget increase over the levels \ncontained in last year's authorization bill. This authorization will \ncontinue\n\n[[Page S6920]]\n\nto allow the Coast Guard to perform non-homeland security missions such \nas search and rescue, fisheries enforcement, and marine environmental \nprotection, as well as fund the necessary missions related to ports, \nwaterways, and coastal security.\n  This bill also includes numerous measures that would allow the Coast \nGuard to enforce provisions of the Maritime Transportation Security \nAct, an essential element in securing the Nation's ports and waterways. \nAdditionally, it would address maritime safety issues by allowing the \nCoast Guard to continue training both the commercial fishing industry \nand the recreational boating public in issues regarding safety at sea. \nJoint training for foreign Nations is also addressed, which allows for \nnation-building and the development of bilateral agreements that allow \nthe Coast Guard to effectively combat the trafficking of illegal \nnarcotics into our Nation, keeping them off the streets and out of our \nschools.\n  In response to the final report of the United States Commission on \nOcean Policy, this bill includes provisions that would allow the Coast \nGuard to work with other Federal, State, and local agencies in \ndeveloping plans to assist vessels in distress, thus eliminating the \npotential for loss of life and environmental damage. It also directs \nthe Coast Guard to develop steps that will allow it to better detect \nand interdict vessels, both American and foreign flagged, that are \nviolating fishing regulations.\n  Finally, we must recognize that the United States Coast Guard is a \nforce conducting 21st century operations with 20th century technology. \nTo accomplish its many vital missions, the Coast Guard desperately \nneeds to recapitalize its offshore fleet of cutters and aircraft. The \nCoast Guard operates the third oldest of the world's 42 similar naval \nfleets with several cutters dating back to World War II. These \nplatforms are technologically obsolete, require excessive maintenance, \nlack essential speed, and have poor interoperability which in turn \nlimit their overall mission effectiveness and efficiency. \nUnfortunately, they are reaching the end of their serviceable life just \nwhen the Coast Guard needs them the most.\n  The Coast Guard continues to progress with its major recapitalization \nprogram for the ships and aircraft designed to operate more than 50 \nmiles offshore. The Integrated Deepwater System acquisition program is \ncritical to the future viability of the Coast Guard. I wholeheartedly \nsupport this initiative and the procurement strategy the Coast Guard is \nutilizing. This bill would authorize full funding for this critical \nlong-term recapitalization program.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1280\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Chairwoman Snowe to \nintroduce the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2005.\n  Those of us from coastal States are especially aware of the important \nrole of the U.S. Coast Guard in maritime security, marine safety, and \nsearch and rescue of mariners. In addition, the Coast Guard is \ninstrumental in protecting our ocean resources through fisheries \nenforcement and response to oil spills.\n  We ask a lot of the Coast Guard, and I am grateful to the men and \nwomen of the U.S. Coast Guard for their dedication and hard work. In \nthis bill, I believe we have provided the Coast Guard with direction \nand authorizations that will help them better serve the public and meet \nthe growing demands of the future.\n  The bill includes authorizations for Fiscal Year 2006 and 2007 \nappropriations that are approximately 8 percent higher than for each \npreceding year. The bill also authorizes a number of important new \nprograms including recommendations of the United States Commission on \nOcean Policy, makes a number of changes sought by the Coast Guard for \npersonnel and property management, and makes necessary technical \ncorrections resulting from the Coast Guard's move from the Department \nof Transportation to the Department of Homeland Security.\n  I am especially pleased that the committee legislation authorizes \n$47,500,000 for the Coast Guard's continued operation and maintenance \nof the Nation's only Polar Ice Breaker fleet. The administration's \nbudget for fiscal year 2006 proposed transferring the funding for \noperation and maintenance of these vessels to the National Science \nFoundation, while leaving operational responsibility with the Coast \nGuard. No other Coast Guard asset is funded in this manner. Subjecting \nthe icebreaker program to the budgeting decisions of another federal \nagency would definitely lead to an uncertain future for the Coast \nGuard's three icebreakers, ultimately undermining the ability of the \nCoast Guard to maintain these assets, and threatening the ability of \nthe United States to maintain a presence in the polar regions over the \nlong term. Section 203 of this legislation specifically calls on the \nCoast Guard to take all necessary measures to maintain its current \nfleet of polar icebreakers, rather than transferring this \nresponsibility to the NSF.\n  This bill includes important funding for additional Coast Guard \ncapital improvement priorities including $10,000,000 for the completion \nof the vessel traffic system upgrade for Puget Sound, one of two \nregions nationwide that has not yet benefited from this important \nupgrade in maritime traffic management and safety. This upgraded vessel \ntraffic system will improve vessel traffic efficiency and safety \nthroughout Washington's coastal waters. This funding also includes $3 \nmillion for completion of a Coast Guard administrative building on Pier \n36 in Seattle that was badly damaged in the Olympia earthquake in 2001. \nThis building is the Command Center for the Coast Guard's Puget Sound \nsearch and rescue and homeland security activities and these funds will \ngreatly improve the Coast Guard's capabilities in this area.\n\n  I am also pleased that the bill directs the Coast Guard to report to \nthe Commerce Committee on opportunities for, the feasibility of, co-\nlocating Coast Guard assets and personnel at facilities of other armed \nservices branches, and entering into cooperative agreements for \ncarrying out various Coast Guard missions. One such facility where co-\nlocation may prove beneficial to both the Coast Guard and the Navy is \nNaval Station Everett, which will be included in the Coast Guard's \nevaluation.\n  In addition, the bill promotes the use of alternative fuels by \nrequiring the Coast Guard to evaluate the feasibility, costs, and \npotential cost savings of using bio-diesel fuel in new and existing \nCoast Guard vehicles and vessels, with a focus on ports such as the \nPort of Seattle with very high vessel traffic density. Bio-diesel and \nother alternative vehicle fuels are already used by the Army at Fort \nLewis, King County Metro Transit, and several school districts and \ncities in Washington State.\n  We have included in the bill a provision that would extend a \nrequirement for non-tank vessels of over 400 gross tons, operating in \nwaters out to 12 miles from the U.S., to prepare emergency response \nplans for oil spills. As we have learned with unfortunate oil spills in \nthe past, such as the recent Daleo Passage Spill, every second matters. \nRequiring large vessels operating in coastal waters to have an \nemergency response plan will help prevent oil spill disasters and, in \nthe event of a spill, mitigate their effects through preparedness.\n  Finally, the bill makes several important changes to the Coast \nGuard's management of personnel. One of these changes modifies current \nCoast Guard rules regarding recalling reservists for acts of terrorism \nand for longer periods of time. This provision ensures that the clock \nfor the length of the recall begins to run on the first day that a \nreservist reports to active duty, including for training. Another \nprovision ensures that the director of the Boating Safety Office \nremains a uniformed officer at the level of captain, in response to \nconcerns from the boating safety community that the Coast Guard was \neliminating this billet.\n  Effective Coast Guard operations are important for the State of \nWashington and for the Nation. I am pleased to join Senators Snowe, \nStevens, and Inouye in introducing this legislation and I look forward \nto working with my colleagues on the Commerce Committee and with the \nCoast Guard to move this legislation quickly through the Committee and \nthe Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself and Mr. Nelson of Florida):\n  S. 1281. A bill to authorize appropriations for the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration for science, aeronautics, \nexploration, exploration capabilities, and the Inspector General, and \nfor other purposes, for fiscal years 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, my friend and colleague, the senior \nSenator from Florida, and I are today introducing a far-reaching bill \nto reauthorize the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for 5 \nyears, from fiscal year 2006 through fiscal year 2010.\n  This legislation is already the product of close bipartisan \ncooperation among Republicans and Democrats, which should be a surprise \nto no one, for space exploration is something that is important to all \nAmericans, and promises and provides benefits to all of us, to all of \nhumanity.\n  This bill represents an important opportunity for the Congress to \nplay its fundamental role, in conjunction with the executive branch, in \nestablishing the policies and principles that will guide our Nation's \nexploration and utilization of space.\n  The President has outlined an ambitious new Vision for Exploration \nthat enables us to see where we can be 30 and 40 years ahead, with a \nrenewed US presence on the Moon and crews and habitats on Mars, and \nperhaps even beyond. I support and endorse that vision and believe it \ndescribes a course America must take into the future.\n  This legislation expresses the sense of the Congress that such a \nbroad, visionary goal is important and necessary to help stimulate our \nefforts today to develop the capabilities and the skills to reach that \ngoal, and to reap tremendous benefits and rewards for all of us here on \nEarth as we do.\n\n[[Page S6926]]\n\n  The bill authorizes funding for NASA for the next 5 fiscal years, \nfrom fiscal year 2006 to fiscal year 2010. The authorized levels are \nclose to those requested in the President's budget request for 2006 and \nincrease at a level to keep pace with estimates of inflation over the \nsubsequent years.\n  Where the legislation differs from the President's request or from \nthe plans that have been developed at NASA to begin the vision for \nexploration, we believe the adjustments made in this legislation will \nimprove NASA's capability to carry out those plans and to sustain the \nhigh level of public and congressional support necessary for the long-\nterm success of the vision for exploration.\n  Those differences revolve around two major areas of concern: (1) the \nneed to ensure a sustained, continuous ability for the United States to \nlaunch crews and cargo into orbit; and (2) the need to maintain our \nexisting commitments to both our international partners and our \nscientific partners in the International Space Station.\n  In other areas of space policy and programs, we have included \nlanguage which expands on the administration proposals. We provide for \nthe establishment, by the President, of a proposed National Policy for \nAeronautics and Aeronautical Research, to provide a framework for \nmaking intelligent and far-reaching decisions about this crucial aspect \nof our Nation's ability to remain competitive in the global market of \naeronautics. We must know what capabilities must be retained in our \npresent aeronautics research infrastructure and what may be better \nserved by changes that would remove the competition within NASA for \nlimited resources in a constrained budgetary environment. Difficult \nchoices must be made, but the first step in making informed decisions \nis to have a comprehensive policy framework to guide those decisions.\n  We endorse and expand, by repeated references in several portions of \nthe bill, the desire to open the door for greater commercial \nparticipation in the exploration and utilization of space and space-\nbased assets, from the development of basic launch capabilities, to \ncrew-capable launch vehicles, to resupply and even research management \nof the International Space Station, and missions to the Moon and Mars, \nto Earth observation and remote sensing capabilities.\n  Commercial capabilities have experienced a dramatic upsurge in the \nrecent past which makes this an especially important and promising \naspect of this legislation. Just one year ago, on June 21, 2004, \nSpaceShipOne, built by the private firm of Scaled Composites, flew into \nthe lower reaches of outer space, making pilot Mike Melvill the first \ncivilian to fly a commercially-built spaceship out of the atmosphere \nand the first private pilot to earn astronaut wings.\n  As I said earlier, we believe the provisions of this legislation will \nmake it easier for NASA to pursue the vision for exploration. Let me, \nin conclusion, expand briefly on that statement by referring to two \nspecific areas of interest: the development of a crew exploration \nvehicle, and the assembly and operation of the International Space \nStation.\n\n  NASA has begun several efforts in the past decade, to develop a \nreplacement vehicle for human space flight, with a view to eventually \nretiring the space shuttle. Each of them has failed, after considerable \nexpense, to find the technological breakthrough that was necessary for \ntheir success. They were focused on new technologies, new systems that \nwere largely untested, and unproven. We are now out of time, and can no \nlonger afford the luxury of attempting to develop a dramatically new \nand different human space flight capability.\n  This legislation directs NASA, wherever practical, to use existing \ntechnology and industrial capacity, derived from our 24 years of \nexperience with the space shuttle, in developing alternative means for \nlaunching crews and cargo into space. This approach promises not only \nto result in less cost to NASA and less risk of failure in development, \nbut it will enable this nation to avoid an unacceptable--and \npotentially dangerous--situation where we do not have a capability to \nlaunch humans in space, especially at a time when the number of nations \nwho have that capability is increasing, as the entry of China into that \nlong-exclusive ``club'' has demonstrated.\n  NASA has said it cannot afford to continue to provide for all the \nresearch that has been planned for years to be accomplished aboard the \nInternational Space Station. It has begun the process of narrowing the \nscope of the use of the space station to those experiments that can \ncontribute directly to the needs of the vision for exploration, and the \nsupport of human missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. This \nlegislation states strongly that such a restriction on the range of \nresearch disciplines aboard the ISS is not in the best interests of the \nNation, or of our partners.\n  The bill directs NASA to retain and support those ``non-vision'' \nscience disciplines, and authorizes an additional $100 million, \ninitially, for NASA to do that. But more importantly, the bill \ndesignates the U.S. portion of the ISS as a national laboratory \nfacility, and directs NASA to provide a plan, by March of next year, \nwhich will enable a national laboratory, within NASA, to assume \nresearch management responsibility for that on-orbit national \nlaboratory facility.\n  The potential gain for NASA is that the national laboratory will be \nempowered to bring other, non-NASA, resources to bear in operating the \nISS, thus freeing NASA of much of that operational responsibility, \nwhile at the same time allowing it to support the specific research it \nneeds for the vision for exploration.\n  The legislation provides other authorities, as requested by the \nadministration, to facilitate NASA operations and management, and \naddresses other issues, such as continued monitoring of safety-related \nissues. While it adds some reporting requirements for NASA, it also \neliminates a number of statutory reporting requirements that are no \nlonger necessary.\n  This legislation to reauthorize NASA is necessary and vital to the \nfuture success of our Nation's effort in the exploration of space, and \nI take great satisfaction in offering it today for the Senate's \nconsideration. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1281\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) It is the policy of the United States to advance United \n     States scientific, security, and economic interests through a \n     healthy and active space exploration program.\n       (2) Basic and applied research in space science, Earth \n     science, and aeronautics remain a significant part of the \n     Nation's goals for the use and development of space. Basic \n     research and development is an important component of NASA's \n     program of exploration and discovery.\n       (3) Maintaining the capability to safely send humans into \n     space is essential to United States national and economic \n     security, United States preeminence in space, and inspiring \n     the next generation of explorers. Thus, a gap in United \n     States human space flight capability is harmful to the \n     national interest.\n       (4) The exploration, development, and permanent habitation \n     of the Moon will--\n       (A) inspire the Nation;\n       (B) spur commerce, imagination, and excitement around the \n     world; and\n       (C) open the possibility of further exploration of Mars.\n       (5) The establishment of the capability for consistent \n     access to and stewardship of the region between the Moon and \n     Earth is in the national security and commercial interests of \n     the United States.\n       (6) Commercial development of space, including exploration \n     and other lawful uses, is in the interest of the United \n     States and the international community at large.\n       (7) Research and access to capabilities to support a \n     national laboratory facility within the United States segment \n     of the ISS in low-Earth orbit are in the national policy \n     interests of the United States, including maintenance and \n     development of an active and healthy stream of research from \n     ground to space in areas that can uniquely benefit from \n     access to this facility.\n       (8) NASA should develop vehicles to replace the Shuttle \n     orbiter's capabilities for transporting crew and heavy cargo \n     while utilizing the current program's resources, including \n     human capital, capabilities, and infrastructure. Using these \n     resources can ease the transition to a new space \n     transportation system, maintain an essential industrial base, \n     and minimize technology and safety risks.\n       (9) The United States should remain the world leader in \n     aeronautics and aviation. NASA should align its aerospace \n     research to ensure United States leadership. A national \n     effort is needed to assess NASA's aeronautics programs and \n     infrastructure to allow a consolidated national approach that \n     ensures efficiency and national preeminence in aeronautics \n     and aviation.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator \nHutchison today in sponsoring a NASA Authorization Act that provides \npolicy guidance for keeping NASA on track to achieve their objectives; \nand to ensure that there is a good balance between the different \nactivities that NASA performs.\n  As chair and ranking member of the Commerce Committee's Subcommittee \non Science and Space, Senator Hutchison and I believe that through this \nbill, Congress can provide constructive support to the good work being \ndone by Administrator Michael Griffin, as they begin to implement the \nPresident's vision and prepare NASA for the challenges of the future.\n  This is a 5-year bill, authorizing NASA from 2006 through 2010. It \nauthorizes NASA appropriations in excess of the President's Budget \nRequest.\n  For fiscal year 2006, the President requested $16.456 billion, which \nis a 2.4 percent increase over the fiscal year 2005 NASA operating \nbudget. This bill authorizes $16.556 billion for fiscal year 2006, \nwhich is a 3.0 percent increase over the fiscal year 2005 NASA \noperating budget. This bill authorizes increases at a level of about 3 \npercent each year, consistently providing more funding than the \nPresident's budget projection.\n  Like many of our colleagues, we believe that recent NASA budget \nrequests have been below the levels required for NASA to perform its \nvarious missions effectively. Once this bill is enacted, we intend to \nwork with the Appropriations Committee to ensure that adequate funds \nare provided for NASA to succeed.\n  This legislation authorizes NASA to return humans to the Moon, to \nexplore it, and to maintain a human presence on the Moon. Consistent \nwith the President's vision, it also requires using what we learn and \ndevelop on the Moon as a stepping-stone to future exploration of Mars.\n  To carry out these missions, our bill requires NASA to develop an \nimplementation plan for the transition from shuttle to crew exploration \nvehicle, CEV. The plan will help NASA to make a smooth transition from \nretirement of the space shuttle orbiters to the replacement spacecraft \nsystems. The implementation plan will help make sure that we can keep \nthe skills and the focus that are needed to assure that each space \nshuttle flight is safe through retirement of the orbiters, and to \nretain those personnel needed for the CEV and heavy lift cargo \nspacecraft.\n  It is essential to our national security that we prevent any hiatus \nor gap in which the United States cannot send astronauts to space \nwithout relying on a foreign country. The Russians have been good \npartners in construction of the international space station, and the \nSoyuz spacecraft has been a reliable vehicle for our astronauts. But \nwith all of the uncertainties in our relationship with Russia, we \nsimply cannot allow ourselves the vulnerability of being totally \ndependent on the Soyuz. We need to maintain assured access to space by \nU.S. astronauts on a continuous basis. We therefore require in this \nlegislation, that there not be a hiatus between the retirement of the \nspace shuttle orbiters and the availability of the next generation U.S. \nhuman-rated spacecraft.\n  We recognize that NASA has some concerns regarding our position on a \nhiatus, and we are aware of Dr. Griffin's efforts to reduce the \npotential for a gap. We will work with NASA as this legislation moves \nforward to ensure that a compromise is reached that is mutually \nsatisfying. This provision does not unduly tie the Administrator's \nhands, while still guaranteeing us assured access to space.\n  Our bill directs NASA to plan for and consider a Hubble servicing \nmission after the 2 space shuttle return to flight missions have been \ncompleted.\n  Americans are inspired by the images that Hubble produces. The new \ninstruments to be added during the SM-4 Hubble servicing mission will \nproduce higher quality images; enable us to see further into space; and \ngive scientists a better understanding of our Universe's past, and \nperhaps of our future. The replacement gyroscopes and batteries that \nare planned for the mission will extend Hubble's life by 5 or more \nyears.\n  This NASA authorization bill calls for utilization of the \ninternational space station for basic science as well as exploration \nscience. It is important that we reap the benefits of our multi-billion \ndollar investment in the space station. The promise of some basic \nscience research requires a microgravity or a space environment for us \nto better understand the problem that we are trying to solve. This bill \nensures that NASA will maintain a focus on the importance of basic \nscience.\n  This bill directs NASA to improve its safety culture. According to \nthe Columbia Accident Investigation Board, CAIB, report, the safety \nculture at NASA was as much a cause of the Columbia tragedy as the \nphysical cause. Low and mid-level personnel felt that you could not \nelevate safety concerns without reprisals, or being ignored. NASA has \nalready taken significant steps to address these problems, but we need \nto assure that the safety culture improves as quickly as possible and \nthat it continues to improve.\n  This legislation proposes that the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel \nmonitor and measure NASA's improvements to their safety culture, \nincluding employees' fear of reprisals for voicing concerns about \nsafety.\n  It also contains policy regarding NASA's need to consider and \nimplement lessons learned, in order to avoid another preventable \ntragedy like the Challenger and Columbia disasters.\n  This authorization bill addresses NASA aeronautics and America's pre-\neminence in aviation. The Europeans have stated their intent to \ndominate the airplane market by 2020. This bill\n\n[[Page S6933]]\n\ndirects the President, through the Director of the Office of Science \nand Technology Policy, OSTP, to work with NASA and other Federal \nagencies to develop a national policy for aeronautics. It also directs \nNASA to evaluate its core aeronautics research.\n  Many people do not realize that NASA does research for improving \nairplanes. NASA conducts research that makes airplanes safer, quieter, \nmore fuel efficient, and less polluting. This important function of \nNASA needs to be continued and further developed.\n  Senator Hutchison and I expect to mark this bill up in the Commerce \nCommittee later this week, and hope to have time to consider it on the \nfloor before the August recess. I will urge all of my colleagues to \nsupport this important legislation. NASA has a new direction, and they \nhave outstanding new leadership in Dr. Griffin.\n  We have an opportunity to authorize NASA for: implementing the Vision \nfor Space Exploration; renewing our commitment to U.S. aviation and \nNASA aeronautics research; retaining or resurrecting very important \nscience activities at NASA; and assuring that America has continuous \nhuman access to space.\n  By doing so, we will continue to advance our national security, \nstrengthen our economy, inspire the next generation of explorers, and \nfulfill our destiny as explorers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Mr. Warner, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \n        Smith, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Collins, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Bond, Mrs. \n        Murray, Mr. Cochran, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n        Talent, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Durbin, and \n        Mr. Hagel):\n  S. 1283. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a \nprogram to assist family caregivers in accessing affordable and high-\nquality respite care, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am proud to reintroduce the Lifespan \nRespite Care Act of 2005 today with my colleague Senator John Warner. \nI'd like to express my sincere thanks to Senator Warner for his \nleadership on this legislation which would make much needed quality \nrespite care available and accessible to families and family caregivers \nin need.\n  Caregiving needs do not discriminate: they demand the time and \nresources of millions of American families from all socioeconomic, \nethnic, and educational backgrounds.\n  Caregivers today provide an enormous portion of our health and long-\nterm care for older adults and individuals with disabilities. Although \nmuch of family caregiving is unpaid, it is not without cost. In fact, \nit is estimated that if services provided by family caregivers were \nprovided instead by paid professionals, they would cost over $200 \nbillion annually. In addition, food, medicines and other caregiving \nnecessities place added strain on already tight family budgets.\n  Because of their responsibilities at home, it is much more difficult \nfor caregivers to find or maintain jobs. Many caregiving families are \nstruggling to stay afloat. We simply cannot afford to continue to \nignore their struggles.\n  In addition to the financial costs of family caregiving, this labor \nof love often results in substantial physical and psychological \nhardship. Research suggests that caregivers often put their own health \nand well being at risk while assisting loved ones. Meeting these \ndifficult demands can lead to depression, physical illness, anxiety, \nand emotional strain.\n  One way to reduce the burden of caregiving is through respite care.\n  As you know, respite care is a service that temporarily relieves a \nfamily member of his or her caregiving duties.\n  Respite care provides some much needed relief from the daily demands \nof caregiving for a few hours or a few days. These welcome breaks help \nprotect the physical and mental health of the family caregiver, making \nit possible for the individual in need of care to remain in the home.\n  Unfortunately, across our country quality respite care remains hard \nto find, and too many caregivers do not even know how to find \ninformation about available services. Where community respite care \nservices do exist, there are often long waiting lists. There are more \ncaregivers in need of respite care than there are available respite \ncare resources.\n  And many caregiving families are hesitant to take advantage of these \nscant resources. Parents and spouses and other family caregivers are \nunderstandably hesitant to leave their loved ones with untrained staff.\n  In an effort to recognize and support the heroic efforts of our \nfamily caregivers, my husband signed the National Family Caregiver \nSupport Program into law as an amendments to the reauthorization of the \nOlder Americans Act in 2000.\n  Prior to the establishment of this program, there was no \ncomprehensive Federal program that supported family caregivers.\n  Although the National Family Caregiver Support Program took a step in \nthe right direction, further efforts are now necessary to meet the \nincreasing needs of family caregivers.\n  That is why I am reintroducing the Lifespan Respite Care Act today \nwith Senator John Warner. This legislation would improve efficiency and \nreduce duplication in respite service development and delivery. And it \nwould make quality respite care available and accessible to families \nand family caregivers, regardless of their Medicaid status, disability, \nor age. It would assure that quality respite care is available for all \ncaregivers who provide this labor of love to individuals across the \nlifespan.\n  My legislation picks up where the National Family Caregiver Support \nProgram leaves off, by recognizing respite as a priority for caregivers \nand elevating respite as a policy priority at the Federal and State \nlevels.\n  This bill would provide grants to develop a coordinated system of \nrespite care services for family caregivers of individuals with special \nneeds regardless of age. Funds could also be used to increase respite \ncare services or to train respite care workers or volunteers.\n  There is much to do at the local, State, and Federal levels to \naddress the growing needs of family caregivers. It is time that we make \ncaregiving a national priority and provide the support that our family \ncaregivers so desperately need.\n  I would like to thank my Senate colleagues for their support of this \nlegislation which passed the Senate last Congress. I look forward to \nworking with you all to improve the lives of our family caregivers, and \nthose for whom they care.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 1284.

Mr. President, I am honored to introduce today a bill--\ncosponsored by Senator Feinstein--to designate a trail in the \nHeadwaters Forest Reserve in California after John L. Burton, one of \nCalifornia's great public servants. The entire California Democratic \ndelegation in the House, led by Representative George Miller, \nintroduced the same bill last week.\n  John served honorably in the United States House of Representatives \nin the early 1980s and in the California State Assembly, before being \nelected to the California State Senate. There, in 1998, his colleagues \nelected him as the California Senate's President Pro Tem. John devoted \nhis career to the service of all Californians, and for that, we honor \nhim with this legislation.\n  Designating this particular trail is a fitting tribute because a few \nyears ago, John was instrumental in protecting the pristine and \ninvaluable land that is now known as the Headwaters Forest Reserve. \nComprised of more than 7,000 acres of ancient redwoods, many of which \nare over 2,000 years old and 300 feet high, the Reserve was saved from \npotentially devastating logging in 1999. Numerous plant species and \nwildlife, including the Marbled Murrelet, dwell in this Reserve. The \nReserve also protects rivers and streams that provide habitat essential \nfor threatened salmon.\n  For his service to the people of California and his essential role in \nprotecting a priceless parcel of California land, I am proud to \nintroduce the John\n\n[[Page S6934]]\n\nL. Burton Trail Act. Through this small action, we recognize and honor \na great man and his great work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/21/senate-section/article/S6934-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 809.

COMPLIANCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) Source of tradeable allowances used.--A covered entity \n     may use a tradeable allowance to meet the requirements of \n     this section without regard to whether the tradeable \n     allowance was allocated to it under subtitle B or acquired \n     from another entity or the Climate Change Credit Corporation \n     established under section --0351.\n       (2) Verification by Administrator.--At various times during \n     each year, the Administrator shall determine whether each \n     covered entity has met the requirements of this section. In \n     making that determination, the Administrator shall--\n       (A) take into account the tradeable allowances submitted by \n     the covered entity to the Administrator; and\n       (B) retire the serial number assigned to each such \n     tradeable allowance.\n       (b) Alternative Means of Compliance.--For the years 2010 \n     and after, a covered entity may satisfy up to 15 percent of \n     its total allowance submission requirement under this section \n     by--\n       (1) submitting tradeable allowances from another nation's \n     market in greenhouse gas emissions if--\n       (A) the Secretary determines that the other nation's system \n     for trading in greenhouse gas emissions is complete, \n     accurate, and transparent and reviews that determination at \n     least once every 5 years;\n       (B) the other nation has adopted enforceable limits on its \n     greenhouse gas emissions which the tradeable allowances were \n     issued to implement; and\n       (C) the covered entity certifies that the tradeable \n     allowance has been retired unused in the other nation's \n     market;\n       (2) submitting a registered net increase in sequestration, \n     as registered in the database, adjusted, if necessary, to \n     comply with the accounting standards and methods established \n     under section --0372;\n       (3) submitting a greenhouse gas emissions reduction (other \n     than a registered net increase in sequestration) that was \n     registered in the database by a person that is not a covered \n     entity; or\n       (4) submitting credits obtained from the Administrator \n     under section --0303.\n       (c) Dedicated Program for Sequestration in Agricultural \n     Soils.--If a covered entity chooses to satisfy 15 percent of \n     its total allowance submission requirements under the \n     provisions of subsection (b), it shall satisfy at least 01.5 \n     percent of its total allowance submission requirement by \n     submitting registered net increases in sequestration in \n     agricultural soils, as registered in the database, adjusted, \n     if necessary, to comply with the accounting standards and \n     methods established under section --0371.\n\n     SEC. 303. BORROWING AGAINST FUTURE REDUCTIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Administrator shall establish a \n     program under which a covered entity may--\n       (1) receive a credit in the current calendar year for \n     anticipated reductions in emissions in a future calendar \n     year; and\n       (2) use the credit in lieu of a tradeable allowance to meet \n     the requirements of this division for the current calendar \n     year, subject to the limitation imposed by section --0302(b).\n       (b) Determination of Tradeable Allowance Credits.--The \n     Administrator may make credits available under subsection (a) \n     only for anticipated reductions in emissions that--\n       (1) are attributable to the realization of capital \n     investments in equipment, the construction, reconstruction, \n     or acquisition of facilities, or the deployment of new \n     technologies--\n       (A) for which the covered entity has executed a binding \n     contract and secured, or applied for, all necessary permits \n     and operating or implementation authority;\n       (B) that will not become operational within the current \n     calendar year; and\n       (C) that will become operational and begin to reduce \n     emissions from the covered entity within 5 years after the \n     year in which the credit is used; and\n\n[[Page S6965]]\n\n       (2) will be realized within 5 years after the year in which \n     the credit is used.\n       (c) Carrying Cost.--If a covered entity uses a credit under \n     this section to meet the requirements of this division for a \n     calendar year (referred to as the use year), the tradeable \n     allowance requirement for the year from which the credit was \n     taken (referred to as the source year) shall be increased by \n     an amount equal to--\n       (1) 10 percent for each credit borrowed from the source \n     year; multiplied by\n       (2) the number of years beginning after the use year and \n     before the source year.\n       (d) Maximum Borrowing Period.--A credit from a year \n     beginning more than 5 years after the current year may not be \n     used to meet the requirements of this division for the \n     current year.\n       (e) Failure to Achieve Reductions Generating Credit.--If a \n     covered entity that uses a credit under this section fails to \n     achieve the anticipated reduction for which the credit was \n     granted for the year from which the credit was taken, then--\n       (1) the covered entity's requirements under this Act for \n     that year shall be increased by the amount of the credit, \n     plus the amount determined under subsection (c);\n       (2) any tradeable allowances submitted by the covered \n     entity for that year shall be counted first against the \n     increase in those requirements; and\n       (3) the covered entity may not use credits under this \n     section to meet the increased requirements.\n\n     SEC. 304. OTHER USES OF TRADEABLE ALLOWANCES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Tradeable allowances may be sold, \n     exchanged, purchased, retired, or used as provided in this \n     section.\n       (b) Intersector Trading.--Covered entities may purchase or \n     otherwise acquire tradeable allowances from other covered \n     sectors to satisfy the requirements of section --0301.\n       (c) Climate Change Credit Corporation.--The Climate Change \n     Credit Corporation established under section --0351 may sell \n     tradeable allowances allocated to it under section --\n     0332(a)(2) to any covered entity or to any investor, broker, \n     or dealer in such tradeable allowances. The Climate Change \n     Credit Corporation shall use all proceeds from such sales in \n     accordance with the provisions of section --0352.\n       (d) Banking of Tradeable Allowances.--Notwithstanding the \n     requirements of section --0301, a covered entity that has \n     more than a sufficient amount of tradeable allowances to \n     satisfy the requirements of section --0301, may refrain from \n     submitting a tradeable allowance to satisfy the requirements \n     in order to sell, exchange, or use the tradeable allowance in \n     the future.\n\n     SEC. 305. EXEMPTION OF SOURCE CATEGORIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Administrator may grant an exemption \n     from the requirements of this division to a source category \n     if the Administrator determines, after public notice and \n     comment, that it is not feasible to measure or estimate \n     emissions from that source category, until such time as \n     measurement or estimation becomes feasible.\n       (b) Reduction of Limitations.--If the Administrator exempts \n     a source category under subsection (a), the Administrator \n     shall also reduce the total tradeable allowances under \n     section --0331(a)(1) by the amount of greenhouse gas \n     emissions that the exempted source category emitted in \n     calendar year 2000, as identified in the 2000 Inventory.\n       (c) Limitation on Exemption.--The Administrator may not \n     grant an exemption under subsection (a) to carbon dioxide \n     produced from fossil fuel.\n\n    Subtitle B--Establishment and Allocation of Tradeable Allowances\n\n     SEC. 331. ESTABLISHMENT OF TRADEABLE ALLOWANCES.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Administrator shall promulgate \n     regulations to establish tradeable allowances, denominated in \n     units of carbon dioxide equivalents, for calendar years \n     beginning after 2009, equal to--\n       (1) 5896 million metric tons, measured in units of carbon \n     dioxide equivalents, reduced by\n       (2) the amount of emissions of greenhouse gases in calendar \n     year 2000 from non-covered entities.\n       (b) Serial Numbers.--The Administrator shall assign a \n     unique serial number to each tradeable allowance established \n     under subsection (a), and shall take such action as may be \n     necessary to prevent counterfeiting of tradeable allowances.\n       (c) Nature of Tradeable Allowances.--A tradeable allowance \n     is not a property right, and nothing in this title or any \n     other provision of law limits the authority of the United \n     States to terminate or limit a tradeable allowance.\n       (d) Non-covered entity.--\n       (1) In general.--In this section the term ``non-covered \n     entity'' means an entity that--\n       (A) owns or controls a source of greenhouse gas emissions \n     in the electric power, industrial, or commercial sectors of \n     the United States economy (as defined in the Inventory), \n     refines or imports petroleum products for use in \n     transportation, or produces or imports hydrofluorocarbons, \n     perfluorocarbons, or sulfur hexafluoride; and\n       (B) is not a covered entity.\n       (2) Exception.--Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an entity \n     that is a covered entity for any calendar year beginning \n     after 2009 shall not be considered to be a non-covered entity \n     for purposes of subsection (a) only because it emitted, or \n     its products would have emitted, 10,000 metric tons or less \n     of greenhouse gas, measured in units of carbon dioxide \n     equivalents, in the year 2000.\n\n     SEC. 332. DETERMINATION OF TRADEABLE ALLOWANCE ALLOCATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary shall determine--\n       (1) the amount of tradeable allowances to be allocated to \n     each covered sector of that sector's allotments; and\n       (2) the amount of tradeable allowances to be allocated to \n     the Climate Change Credit Corporation established under \n     section --0351.\n       (b) Allocation Factors.--In making the determination \n     required by subsection (a), the Secretary shall consider--\n       (1) the distributive effect of the allocations on household \n     income and net worth of individuals;\n       (2) the impact of the allocations on corporate income, \n     taxes, and asset value;\n       (3) the impact of the allocations on income levels of \n     consumers and on their energy consumption;\n       (4) the effects of the allocations in terms of economic \n     efficiency;\n       (5) the ability of covered entities to pass through \n     compliance costs to their customers;\n       (6) the degree to which the amount of allocations to the \n     covered sectors should decrease over time; and\n       (7) the need to maintain the international competitiveness \n     of United States manufacturing and avoid the additional loss \n     of United States manufacturing jobs.\n       (c) Allocation Recommendations and Implementation.--Before \n     allocating or providing tradeable allowances under subsection \n     (a) and within 24 months after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary shall submit the determinations under \n     subsection (a) to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, \n     and Transportation, the Senate Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works, the House of Representatives Committee on \n     Science, and the House of Representatives Committee on Energy \n     and Commerce. The Secretary's determinations under paragraph \n     (1), including the allocations and provision of tradeable \n     allowances pursuant to that determination, are deemed to be a \n     major rule (as defined in section 804(2) of title 5, United \n     States Code), and subject to the provisions of chapter 8 of \n     that title.\n\n     SEC. 333. ALLOCATION OF TRADEABLE ALLOWANCES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Beginning with calendar year 2010 and \n     after taking into account any initial allocations under \n     section --0335, the Administrator shall--\n       (1) allocate to each covered sector that sector's \n     allotments determined by the Administrator under section --\n     0332 (adjusted for any such initial allocations and the \n     allocation to the Climate Change Credit Corporation \n     established under section --0351); and\n       (2) allocate to the Climate Change Credit Corporation \n     established under section --0351 the tradeable allowances \n     allocable to that Corporation.\n       (b) Intrasectorial Allotments.--The Administrator shall, by \n     regulation, establish a process for the allocation of \n     tradeable allowances under this section, without cost to \n     covered entities, that will--\n       (1) encourage investments that increase the efficiency of \n     the processes that produce greenhouse gas emissions;\n       (2) minimize the costs to the government of allocating the \n     tradeable allowances;\n       (3) not penalize a covered entity for emissions reductions \n     made before 2010 and registered with the database; and\n       (4) provide sufficient allocation for new entrants into the \n     sector.\n       (c) Point Source Allocation.--The Administrator shall \n     allocate the tradeable allowances for the electricity \n     generation, industrial, and commercial sectors to the \n     entities owning or controlling the point sources of \n     greenhouse gas emissions within that sector.\n       (d) Hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur \n     hexafluoride.--The Administrator shall allocate the tradeable \n     allowances for producers or importers of hydrofluorocarbons, \n     perfluorocarbons, or sulfur hexafluoride to such producers or \n     importers.\n       (e) Special Rule for Allocation within the Transportation \n     Sector.--The Administrator shall allocate the tradeable \n     allowances for the transportation sector to petroleum \n     refiners or importers that produce or import petroleum \n     products that will be used as fuel for transportation.\n       (f) Allocations to Rural Electric Cooperatives.--For each \n     electric generating unit that is owned or operated by a rural \n     electric cooperative, the Administrator shall allocate each \n     year, at no cost, allowances in an amount equal to the \n     greenhouse gas emissions of each such unit in 2000, plus an \n     amount equal to the average emissions growth expected for all \n     such units. The allocations shall be offset from the \n     allowances allocated to the Climate Change Credit \n     Corporation.\n       (g) Early Auction for Technology Deployment and \n     Dissemination.--\n       (1) In general.--Within 1 year after the date of enactment \n     of this Act, the Administrator, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Commerce, shall \n     allocate tradeable allowances by the Climate Change Credit \n     Corporation for auction before 2010. The Climate Change \n     Credit Corporation shall use the proceeds of the\n\n[[Page S6966]]\n\n     auction, together with any funds received as reimbursements \n     under subtitle C of title IV of this division, to support the \n     programs established by that subtitle until the secretary of \n     Energy and the Corporation jointly determine that the \n     purposes of those programs have been accomplished. The \n     Corporation shall also use the proceeds of the auction to \n     support the programs established by subtitle D of title IV of \n     this division until 2010.\n       (2) Determination of allocation.--In determining the amount \n     of tradeable allowances to be allocated to the Climate Change \n     Credit Corporation under this subsection, the Administrator \n     shall consider--\n       (A) the expected market value of tradeable allowances for \n     auction;\n       (B) the annual funding required for the programs \n     established by subtitle C of title IV;\n       (C) the repayment provisions of those programs; and\n       (D) the allocation factors in section --0332(b).\n       (3) Limitation.--In allocating tradeable allowances under \n     paragraph (1) the Administrator shall take into account the \n     purposes of section --0331 and the impact, if any, the \n     allocation under paragraph (1) may have on achieving those \n     purposes.\n       (h) Allocation to Covered Entities in States Adopting \n     Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Programs.--For a \n     covered entity operating in any State that has adopted a \n     legally binding and enforceable program to achieve and \n     maintain reductions that are consistent with, or more \n     stringent than, reductions mandated by this Act, and which \n     requirements are effective prior to 2010, the Administrator \n     shall consider such binding state actions in making the final \n     determination of allocation to such covered entities.\n\n     SEC. 334. ENSURING TARGET ADEQUACY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Beginning 2 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Under Secretary of Commerce for \n     Oceans and Atmosphere shall review the allowances established \n     by section --0331 no less frequently than biennially--\n       (1) to re-evaluate the levels established by that \n     subsection, after taking into account the best available \n     science and the most currently available data, and\n       (2) to re-evaluate the environmental and public health \n     impacts of specific concentration levels of greenhouse gases,\n\n     to determine whether the allowances established by subsection \n     (a) continue to be consistent with the objective of the \n     United Nations' Framework Convention on Climate Change of \n     stabilizing levels of greenhouse gas emissions at a level \n     that will prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with \n     the climate system.\n       (b) Review of 2010 Levels.--The Under Secretary shall \n     specifically review in 2008 the level established under \n     section --0331(a)(1), and transmit a report on his reviews, \n     together with any recommendations, including legislative \n     recommendations, for modification of the levels, to the \n     Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, \n     the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, the \n     House of Representatives Committee on Science, and the House \n     of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce.\n\n     SEC. 335. INITIAL ALLOCATIONS FOR EARLY PARTICIPATION AND \n                   ACCELERATED PARTICIPATION.\n\n       (a) Before making any allocations under section --0333, the \n     Administrator shall allocate--\n       (1) to any covered entity an amount of tradeable allowances \n     equivalent to the amount of greenhouse gas emissions \n     reductions registered by that covered entity in the national \n     greenhouse gas database if--\n       (A) the covered entity has requested to use the registered \n     reduction in the year of allocation;\n       (B) the reduction was registered prior to 2010; and\n       (C) the Administrator retires the unique serial number \n     assigned to the reduction under section --0201(c)(3); and\n       (2) to any covered entity that has entered into an \n     accelerated participation agreement under section --0336, \n     such tradeable allowances as the Administrator has determined \n     to be appropriate under that section.\n       (b) Any covered entity that is subject to a State mandatory \n     greenhouse gas emissions reduction program that meets the \n     requirements of subsection (h) of section --0333 shall be \n     eligible for the allocation of allowances under this section \n     and section --0336 if the requirements of the State mandatory \n     greenhouse gas emission reduction program are consistent \n     with, or more stringent than, the emission targets \n     established by this Act.\n\n     SEC. 336. BONUS FOR ACCELERATED PARTICIPATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--If a covered entity executes an agreement \n     with the Administrator under which it agrees to reduce its \n     level of greenhouse gas emissions to a level no greater than \n     the level of its greenhouse gas emissions for calendar year \n     1990 by the year 2010, then, for the 6-year period beginning \n     with calendar year 2010, the Administrator shall--\n       (1) provide additional tradeable allowances to that entity \n     when allocating allowances under section --0334 in order to \n     recognize the additional emissions reductions that will be \n     required of the covered entity;\n       (2) allow that entity to satisfy 20 percent of its \n     requirements under section --0301 by--\n       (A) submitting tradeable allowances from another nation's \n     market in greenhouse gas emissions under the conditions \n     described in section --0312(b)(1);\n       (B) submitting a registered net increase in sequestration, \n     as registered in the National Greenhouse Gas Database \n     established under section --0201, and as adjusted by the \n     appropriate sequestration discount rate established under \n     section --0371; or\n       (C) submitting a greenhouse gas emission reduction (other \n     than a registered net increase in sequestration) that was \n     registered in the National Greenhouse Gas Database by a \n     person that is not a covered entity.\n       (b) Termination.--An entity that executes an agreement \n     described in subsection (a) may terminate the agreement at \n     any time.\n       (c) Failure to Meet Commitment.--If an entity that executes \n     an agreement described in subsection (a) fails to achieve the \n     level of emissions to which it committed by calendar year \n     2010--\n       (1) its requirements under section --0301 shall be \n     increased by the amount of any tradeable allowances provided \n     to it under subsection (a)(1); and\n       (2) any tradeable allowances submitted thereafter shall be \n     counted first against the increase in those requirements.\n\n             Subtitle C--Climate Change Credit Corporation\n\n     SEC. 351.

SEQUESTRATION ACCOUNTING.\n\n       (a) Sequestration Accounting.--If a covered entity uses a \n     registered net increase in sequestration to satisfy the \n     requirements of section --0301 for any year, that covered \n     entity shall submit information to the Administrator every 5 \n     years thereafter sufficient to allow the Administrator to \n     determine, using the methods and standards created under \n     section --0204, whether that net increase in sequestration \n     still exists. Unless the Administrator determines that the \n     net increase in sequestration continues to exist, the covered \n     entity shall offset any loss of sequestration by submitting \n     additional tradeable allowances of equivalent amount in the \n     calender year following that determination.\n       (b) Regulations Required.--The Secretary, acting through \n     the Under Secretary of Commerce for Science and Technology, \n     in coordination with the Secretary of Agriculture, the \n     Secretary of Energy, and the Administrator, shall issue \n     regulations establishing the sequestration accounting rules \n     for all classes of sequestration projects.\n       (c) Criteria for Regulations.--In issuing regulations under \n     this section, the Secretary shall use the following criteria:\n       (1) If the range of possible amounts of net increase in \n     sequestration for a particular class of sequestration project \n     is not more than 10 percent of the median of that range, the \n     amount of sequestration awarded shall be equal to the median \n     value of that range.\n       (2) If the range of possible amounts of net increase in \n     sequestration for a particular class of sequestration project \n     is more than 10 percent of the median of that range, the \n     amount of sequestration awarded shall be equal to the fifth \n     percentile of that range.\n       (3) The regulations shall include procedures for accounting \n     for potential leakage from sequestration projects and for \n     ensuring that any registered increase in sequestration is in \n     addition that which would have occurred if this Act had not \n     been enacted.\n       (d) Updates.--The Secretary shall update the sequestration \n     accounting rules for every class of sequestration project at \n     least once every 5 years.\n\n     SEC. 372. PENALTIES.\n\n       Any covered entity that fails to meet the requirements of \n     section --0301 for a year shall be liable for a civil \n     penalty, payable to the Administrator, equal to thrice the \n     market value (determined as of the last day of the year at \n     issue) of the tradeable allowances that would be necessary \n     for that covered entity to meet those requirements on the \n     date of the emission that resulted in the violation.\n\n                TITLE IV--INNOVATION AND COMPETITIVENESS\n\n     SEC. 401. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Innovation, the process that ultimately provides new \n     and improved products, manufacturing processes, and services, \n     is the basis for technological progress. This technological \n     advancement is a key element of sustained economic growth.\n       (2) The innovation economy is fundamentally different from \n     the industrial or even the information economy. It requires a \n     new vision and new approaches.\n       (3) Changing innovation processes and the evolution of the \n     relative contribution made by the private and public sectors \n     have emphasized the need for strong industry-science \n     linkages.\n       (4) Patent regimes play an increasingly complex role in \n     encouraging innovation, disseminating scientific and \n     technical knowledge, and enhancing market entry and firm \n     creation.\n       (5) Increasing participation and maintaining quality \n     standards in tertiary education in science and technology are \n     imperative to meet growing demand for workers with scientific \n     and technological knowledge and skills.\n       (6) Research, innovation, and human capital are our \n     principal strengths. By sustaining United States investments \n     in research and finding collaborative arrangements to \n     leverage existing resources and funds in a scarce budget \n     environment, we ensure that America remains at the forefront \n     of scientific and technological capability.\n       (7) Technology transfer of publicly funded research is a \n     critical mechanism for optimizing the return on taxpayer \n     investment, particularly where other benefits are not \n     measurable at all or are very long-term.\n       (8) Identifying metrics to quantify program effectiveness \n     is of increasing importance because the entire innovation \n     process is continuing to evolve in an arena of increasing \n     global competition. Metrics need to take into account a wide \n     range of steps in a highly complex process, as well as the \n     ultimate product or service, but should not constrain the \n     continued evolution or development of new technology transfer \n     approaches.\n       (9) The United States lacks a national innovation strategy \n     and agenda, including an aggressive public policy strategy \n     that energizes the environment for national innovation, and \n     no Federal agency is responsible for developing national \n     innovation policy.\n\n                 Subtitle A--Innovation Infrastructure\n\n     SEC. 421.
