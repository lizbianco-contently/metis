Mr. President, much of the discussion of Social Security \nhas been dominated by the politics of fear, scaring seniors into \nbelieving their benefits will be cut or taken away.\n  Let me be clear. Discussions about Social Security are not about the \nretirement security of those Americans who are 55 or older; the Social \nSecurity system for folks 55 and older is fine. It is not going to be \nchanged. I will be one of those. If you were born before 1950, you are \nOK. There is nothing to worry about. In fact, I urge those 55 or older, \ntalk to your kids; Talk to your grandkids; Start thinking a little bit \nabout their future.\n\n  Social Security is a sacred trust. Many Minnesotan seniors depend on \nSocial Security each month to buy food and medicine. Those checks are \ngoing to continue regardless of what happens in the discussion today.\n  The reality is we face a challenge, the challenge that the President \nof the United States talked about in the State of the Union, a \nchallenge to work in a bipartisan way to fix the problems we all know \nSocial Security faces today.\n\n[[Page S1440]]\n\n  Society is changing. We are living longer. We are healthier, more \nproductive. This places greater pressures on America's retirement \nsystem.\n  When Social Security was started, there were 41 workers for every \nretiree. By 1960, there were 16 workers per retiree. Today there are 3 \nworkers per retiree. When the baby boomers start to retire in only 3 \nyears, there will be a point where there are 2 workers for every \nretiree. That is the challenge we face.\n  As we start to retire, right now we have a surplus. In 13 years, we \nwill be paying more out of Social Security than is coming in as more \nand more baby boomers retire. Congress will be faced in a little over a \ndecade and beyond with a decision of how to make up the hundreds of \nbillions of dollars going out of a system, than is coming in. That will \nhave an impact on many other things we need to do for the country.\n  The challenge is, do we sit and wait? Three years comes quickly. In \n13 years, the system pays out more than comes in. What do we do before \nwe reach that point? It is not bankrupt but it means it does not have \nenough money to pay its obligations. Two-thirds of the folks working \ntoday every day have 12 percent from their paycheck taken out for \nSocial Security every week. At a certain point they will not have that. \nThat is a reality. It is not political rhetoric. It is a reflection of \ndemographics.\n  The question is, What do we do? I offer personal experience on an \nissue like this to my colleagues to reflect upon. When I was elected \nmayor of St. Paul in 1993, there was a contract settled before I became \nmayor. My budget director then walked in, and said: Mr. Mayor, we will \nhave $200 million of unfunded liability retiree health benefits based \non their contract unless we do something. The good news is it is 15 \nyears away. My advisers said, 15 years away, that is not your problem; \nthat is someone else's problem down the road.\n  I had a son who was 8 years old and my daughter was 4. I thought that \n8 years was a blink of the eye. Fifteen years is two blinks of the eye. \nIt comes quickly. Any parent knows if your kid today is 3 years old, 5 \nyears old, they will start college in 13 years. It is a blink of the \neye.\n  The reality is I got sued and picketed, but we worked out a solution. \nWe rejected a contract and worked out a solution that did not impact \nthose in the program today, not unlike what the President is saying, \nthat we are not going to impact those who are 55 or older today, but \nfor younger people coming in we are going to look at their future and \nfigure out what we are going to do. And we did. That was a little over \na decade, 12 years ago. I don't see discussion today in St. Paul, the \ncapital city, about unfunded liability. We had the courage to address \nthe situation.\n\n  The challenge is to fix Social Security permanently in an open, \ncandid, and bipartisan approach to reviewing the option. Any proposal \nmust be fashioned in a bipartisan way. On this score, the President \nhighlighted a number of proposals that friends on the other side of the \naisle in the past have offered.\n  For example, President Clinton spoke of increasing the retirement age \nwhen he was in office. Former Congressman Tim Penny from my home State \nof Minnesota has raised the possibility of indexing benefits to prices \nrather than wages. Former Senator John Breaux suggested discouraging \nthe early collection of Social Security benefits. The late Senator \nDaniel Patrick Moynihan recommended changing the way benefits are \ncalculated.\n  I am hopeful my Democratic colleagues today will have the wisdom of \ntheir predecessors to recognize a problem is on the horizon and will \nhave the willingness to work with us to find a solution. Again, some \nwill tie this discussion to a national scare campaign to exploit fears \nfor political gain. Don't. Talking about the future of our kids is way \ntoo important. Today's discussion about Social Security is about giving \nthe younger generation, in part, a higher rate of return on the paltry \n1.6 percent they earn from Social Security today, a 1.6-percent return \non their investment.\n  There is a discussion we are having about allowing younger workers \nthe opportunity to build their own nest egg, to give them a sense of \nownership that they do not have over the money they themselves earn and \npay into Social Security. It is their money and they are working for \nit. They should have the right to generate a return on that investment \nin a way that is not subject to speculation, not subject to rolling the \ndice. We can set up a system that gives younger workers an opportunity \nto have a nest egg that will grow. That is not the entire solution, but \nit is part of the solution.\n\n  Let us have the willingness to work together to give young people \nthat opportunity to have a piece of the rock for themselves and, at the \nsame time, have the courage to deal with some of the broader issues.\n  The question is, Will we in Congress make a political decision and do \nwhat is easy and push a $10.4 trillion gap in Social Security to \nanother generation and another Congress or will we make the responsible \ndecision and try to find a way to make sure America's retirement system \nis there for future generations? I sincerely hope we choose not to pass \nalong to our children and grandchildren a decision which may be \ndifficult today but devastating tomorrow.\n  It has been said that necessity is the mother of invention. There is \na real opportunity right now as parents and grandparents to come up \nwith a plan that leaves our kids with something better than we have; \nthat is, an opportunity to own, build, and grow a nest egg of their \nown.\n  In conclusion, as President Clinton declared in 1998 about Social \nSecurity reform:\n\n       We all know a demographic crisis is looming. If we act now, \n     it will be easier and less painful than if we wait until \n     later.\n\n  It is 2005. It is time to do something. I hope my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle come together and get it done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I will continue discussing the issue \nbefore the Senate, Social Security, which in the last several weeks has \nbeen talked about in Washington, DC, and throughout the country.\n  Reactions have been interesting--many without much information about \nthe alternatives, the needs. I suspect the most important thing we can \ndo is to talk about the situation as it exists, the situation as it \nwill exist if we do nothing, what the options are and what the impacts \nwill be.\n  It has become, right or wrong, the principal issue. I don't think \nanything will happen too quickly because there needs to be time taken \nto explore the issue, to get people to understand the issues. Everyone \nis meeting at home with their constituents.\n  I met last weekend in Cheyenne, WY, with the AARP and exchanged some \nideas. We have to continue that.\n  In my view, the President has properly brought forth the issue. He \nhas indicated, if we do not do something now it will be even more \ndifficult to do it in the future years. I don't think anyone argues the \nidea that our prime purpose is to maintain Social Security so it \nfulfills what has been laid out for people in the future, so it does \nnot affect those in retirement on Social Security or affect those \ncloser to that age.\n  It is naive to imagine a program put into place in the 1930s will go \non for another 100 years without having some changes. Changes have \ntaken place certainly in this country and will continue to take place.\n  I am hopeful we can explore the situation, that we can become more \nfamiliar with the impact if we do nothing, become more familiar with \npotential problems that will exist, and then, of course, take a look at \npotential changes.\n  It is important to understand what the administration and the \nPresident has laid out. As the President has said a number of times, he \nis willing to take a look at different solutions. That is where we are.\n  We had a meeting in the Finance Committee yesterday and went over \ninteresting ideas, primarily, the so-called trust fund that exists. You \ncan predict what will happen in that in terms of the cashflow, in terms \nof the interest.\n  Everyone does not recognize that when the Social Security moneys come \nin they go into the Federal fund with all other incomes and then they \nare sent over with a bond to the trust fund\n\n[[Page S1441]]\n\nand interest is earned on that trust fund from the Federal Government \nbasic incomes. Those are bonds that come over and, of course, will, \nover time, like about 2009 when the income does not equal the outgo, \nthese trust funds will have to be turned into cash so they can then be \nused to pay benefits.\n  My goals are to protect the promised benefits to retirees and \npotential retirees, to create a system for future generations, so the \nbenefits of financial security that have been enjoyed by others will \ncontinue to be enjoyed for our kids as time goes by.\n  I believe strongly in the idea of incentives for people to create \ntheir own retirement program. Social Security was designed to be a \nsupplement. I am hopeful--whether it is in the Social Security Program \nor whether it is outside of that program--that we continue to provide \nincentives for people to put aside their own money for retirement. Of \ncourse, in order to make that successful, the earlier you start putting \naside some money, the more likely you are to have some when you need it \nlater.\n  That is one of the issues before the Congress, whether the personal \naccounts should be made part of Social Security so there would be an \nopportunity for the kind of growth that can take place in the private \nsector.\n  However, those are two different issues. They are both very \nimportant. We can talk about them both, some of the things that need to \nbe done for the Social Security Program as it exists and some of the \nthings that can be done in the area of personal accounts.\n  There are difficult choices to be made. Obviously, some talk about \nincreasing the payroll taxes. I don't think anyone is enthusiastic \nabout that idea. There are ideas of going over the limits that are now \nthere for the people who pay into, over a certain amount. That could be \nincreased, I suppose. That is one of the options.\n\n  The idea of doing something about benefits, of course, is also an \noption. I do not know quite what specifically could be done, but I \nsuppose there is talk about having benefits somewhat tied to the \nperson's own resources and providing more benefits to people who have \nless resources than those who have more. That is a possibility.\n  I mentioned increasing the cap on the wages taxed. That has been \ntalked about. Now the limit is $90,000. Some say it might be able to go \nabove that.\n  There certainly are opportunities to talk about raising the age \nlimit. One of the things that has changed so much, of course, is the \nfact that when the Social Security Program started, there were maybe as \nmany as 20-some people working for every person drawing benefits. Now \nthat has changed dramatically. It is my understanding that now there \nare about three working people for every person drawing benefits. So \nthat is quite a different situation.\n  At the start of Social Security I think life expectancy was probably \nin the lower sixties. If you retired at age 65, quite a number of \npeople did not enjoy the benefits of Social Security. Now, fortunately, \nlife expectancy is much longer than that. So some have talked about \nperhaps over time raising the age for retirement.\n  There will be other options, of course, as to how these things might \nbe done. I guess my real strong feeling is, No. 1, we have to do \nsomething because the system cannot go on as it has. No. 2, we ought to \nget as knowledgeable as we possibly can--all of us--about what the \nimpacts are, what the situation is, what the alternatives are that \ncould be used.\n  I think another idea is that it does not need to be done next week. \nThis is something we can work on for a while. I do not mean 5 years, \nbut maybe towards the end of the year we would be in a better position \nto do something. But the changes are not an option. We have to do some \nof those kinds of things, and we have to do them fairly quickly.\n  I was a little disappointed that, as this issue came out, we found \nsome kind of immediate reaction: We are not going to do anything with \nthat; We don't want to touch it.\n  Well, that is not an option, in our view. I suppose you could argue \nabout critical timing, but it is very clear the longer we wait, the \nmore difficult it will be to find solutions, and the more impact those \nsolutions will have on what we are talking about.\n  Another idea, of course, is that we ought to look at other ways to do \nit. As a matter of fact, we have some bills, and the administration is \nlooking at doing some things to encourage more tax-free investments for \npeople's retirement years. I think that is one of the great ideas. \nThere are two ways to do that, of course. No. 1, you can allow those \nmoneys to go into an account before taxes, or the alternative is to go \nahead and pay taxes on it now, and when it comes out, there would be no \ntaxes on it.\n  For people who are in their retirement years, to be able to take \ntheir money out without taxing it is probably one of the most \nattractive alternatives. I have been working with the administration, \nand we intend to have a bill soon that will make it a little simpler. \nWe have quite a number of different kinds of retirement programs now, \nand they are a little difficult to keep up with, and a little \nconfusing, so we will soon, hopefully, make those a little bit \ndifferent.\n\n  I am very pleased the President has undertaken this effort and has \nspent a good deal of time on it. He has basically handed the Congress a \nblueprint. Some are saying: Well, where is the plan? I think it is good \nthe President has laid out the problem, laid out some of the \nalternatives, but has, in fact, said--and our committee met with him \nsome time ago in the White House, and he indicated that, no, he is not \nsending out a specific proposal but is giving us ideas and a broader \nconcept of where he would like to see us go.\n  So looking to the future, for all of us, as citizens--for the \ncountry, for ourselves--is something we must do.\n  Mr. President, I see my friend from Pennsylvania in the Chamber. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority's 30 minutes is now expired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, since I do not see anybody on the other \nside, I ask unanimous consent for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, first I thank and congratulate the \nSenator from Wyoming for his comments and also for his steadfast duty \nin coming here to make the case on a variety of different issues. This \nissue, in particular, Social Security, is a passion of mine, something \nI have worked on since I came to the Senate back in 1995. To me, this, \nas the Senator from Wyoming just said, is about a social compact from \none generation to the next.\n  What we are in danger of doing is breaking that compact. We are in \ndanger of telling the next generation of Americans who are entering the \nworkforce that if we do nothing now, they, as a generation, will not \nget a positive return on their money. In other words, they will not get \nout of the system money they put in. To me, that is breaking this \ncompact.\n  Every generation of seniors that has retired--in fact, those who are \nat or near retirement now--will, in fact, be able to get some measure \nof return on their money. Some earlier generations got very high rates \nof return. This generation's retirees will get a relatively low rate of \nreturn, but they will have invested money or paid into the program for \npeople in the system while they were working and at least be able to \nget their money out of the system they paid in when they retire.\n  If we do nothing, which some have suggested we should do, which I \nthink is irresponsible, but if we do nothing and simply wait for this \ngeneration that is in their twenties and thirties right now to retire, \nthen they will be hit with one of two things. Either in the next few \nyears--10 to 15 years--they will be hit with payroll taxes which will \ntake their rate of return, if you will, from a bare positive to a \nnegative or they will be hit with benefit cuts which, again, will take \ntheir rate of return--to get out of the system what they put in--and \nturn that into a negative.\n  That, in my mind, is breaking the compact. That is saying we have now \nturned Social Security into somewhat of just simply a tax from one \ngeneration and transferring it to another in an ever-increasing \nseverity of tax. I think we can do better than that. That is what the \nPresident has suggested. He has come forward on an issue that he\n\n[[Page S1442]]\n\ndid not have to. This problem is not going to hit America until \nprobably the midteens when we begin to go negative into the Social \nSecurity system. In other words, we will not have the amount of money \ncoming in to pay for benefits. Borrowing will have to start to occur \nfrom the Government side to pay off these bonds that are in the Social \nSecurity trust fund in order to pay benefits. We will do something at \nthat point in time because the deficit impact will be huge on the \nUnited States of America.\n  Social Security, instead of running $100 billion surpluses, will be \nrunning $200 billion deficits. Compound that with the growth of \nMedicare and other things we are seeing, and we will be in a huge \ndeficit situation, which will cause either income taxes to go up, \nspending on the Government side to go down--which I think is highly \nunlikely--benefit cuts in Medicare and Social Security, or tax \nincreases for Medicare and Social Security. Any one of those situations \nputs a burden on future generations either through benefit reductions \nor tax increases, which I think is breaking the compact that we have \nhad since 1936 with our seniors.\n  I am hopeful we can find some bipartisan cooperation to look at the \nproblem that is confronting us and say: We have an opportunity to give \npeople hope, to give younger people hope that we can have a better \nsystem for them than currently is promised. What is promised for people \nin their twenties right now is basically 70 cents on the dollar of the \nbenefits that are promised under the system. We can only pay for 70 \ncents on the dollar. That is what this current system provides.\n  So when you hear, ``We will keep these promises,'' I understand what \nkeeping the promises means. It means higher taxes for future workers or \nlower benefits for future retirees. That is what happens if we wait.\n  So the idea that says there is no problem, understand what that \nmeans. That means future generations--whether it is 5 years from now, \n10 years from now, 15 years from now--will be hit with higher taxes and \nlower benefits or some combination of them or maybe one exclusive of \nthe other. But the bottom line is, it is going to impact adversely that \ngeneration of workers and that generation of seniors.\n  We can avoid this problem right now if we allow younger workers the \nopportunity to put some money away, invest in the American economy, the \nstrength of the American economy, with broad-based index funds that \ninvest in the growth and future of the American economy, which I think \nwe all have high hopes for and believe will be strong going into the \nfuture. We believe that is the most responsible way of avoiding this \nbreaking of the compact with future generations, of saying to future \ngenerations they will not do as well as other generations of Americans \nhave done under the current system.\n\n  So with that, Mr. President, I thank the other side for their \nindulgence and for the 5 minutes, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next 30 minutes is controlled by the \nDemocratic leader or his designee.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to reiterate \nthat I am extremely concerned about President Bush's proposed Social \nSecurity restructuring, privatization--whatever the code word of the \nday is--restructuring, which I believe is going to put at real risk the \nsecurity of all Americans in this country, from our young workers who \nwill be retiring in future decades, to our seniors who are retiring \ntoday or who are already retired.\n  As President Bush's plan has come out, we are realizing what it will \ndo. It will end the guaranteed benefit that is such a critical part of \nthis insurance program today. We also see that it is going to do \nnothing to fix the long-term issues that face Social Security. Just \nprivatizing and restructuring it is not going to solve those long-term \nissues.\n  I am also here today to emphasize the fact that this restructuring or \nprivatization plan is going to add trillions of dollars to our national \ndebt--trillions of dollars when we already have record deficits that \nfuture generations will be responsible for. This privatization plan \nadds trillions of dollars to our national debt.\n  As President Bush has been traveling around the country to sell his \nprivatization plan, we hear him say:\n\n       We have an obligation and a duty to confront problems and \n     not pass them on to future generations.\n\n  Well, many of us, on both sides of the aisle, agree with him. We \nshould not create new problems for the next generation to handle. But \nthe trouble is, that is exactly what this President's plan does. It \nactually adds to the problems of the next generation. It does nothing \nto solve them.\n  I think it is time for President Bush to level with the American \npeople about what his program really is. It really is a new recipe for \na continuing fall into a black hole of debt. This plan, as the \nPresident is proposing, is going to run up $5 trillion in debt that our \ngeneration will not pay for. It is going to fall squarely on the \nshoulders of our children and our grandchildren.\n  The President not only wants to gamble away the secure future that \nretirees count on today, he wants to burden them with a huge new $5 \ntrillion debt.\n  Now, there is another point worth making about the President's plan \nas well. I keep hearing him say that anyone over 55 will not be \naffected. Anyone over 55--well, let's be clear. Anyone over 55 will be \nimpacted by this tremendous new debt that is incurred.\n  President Bush can say he will not cut your benefits now, but how can \nhe guarantee that if we take trillions of dollars from the Social \nSecurity trust fund for this privatization plan?\n  All we have to do, to understand this situation, is to look at the \nrecord.\n  Just last week, we got a budget with the biggest deficit in our \nNation's history--4 short years after the budget had the largest \nsurplus in our Nation's history. A few days later, we saw cost \nestimates for the Medicare prescription drug benefit balloon from the \n$400 billion we were told it would cost to now it costing more than \n$700 billion.\n  Now the Bush administration plans to add trillions to our balance \nsheet by privatizing Social Security. Let's take a look at this chart. \nIt tells the picture clearly. As we see with this chart, there is more \nred ink in the President's budget than we care to see for years to \ncome. Unfortunately, if his privatization plan goes into effect, \nmassive new debt increases are added in the years after this plan takes \neffect. The President, as he did with Medicare, likes to talk about the \ncost of implementation over 10-year periods. What he does not mention \nis that for 5 years under those projections, the plan is not fully \nphased in. So rather than considering his already bloated $700 billion \ntransition projection, let's look at an outside source.\n  The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says the borrowing numbers \nwe have heard from the administration ``are misleadingly low.''\n\n       They are generated by using a ten-year budget window (2006 \n     to 2015) that includes only five years of the fully phased-in \n     plan. The plan would not be launched until 2009 and not be in \n     full effect until 2011.\n       Over the first ten years that the plan actually was in \n     effect (2009 to 2018) it would add $1.4 trillion to the debt. \n     Over the next ten years (2019 to 2028) it would add about \n     $3.5 trillion more to the debt. All told, the plan would add \n     $4.9 trillion (14 percent of GDP in 2028) to the debt over \n     the first 20 years.\n\n  That is almost $5 trillion. That money is going to have to come from \nsomewhere, and it is pretty naive to think that huge new borrowing will \nnot affect our current retirees. It is naive to think massive new \nborrowing won't affect programs such as Medicare or Medicaid that do \nneed our attention. And it is naive to think we will simply go along \nand pass this massive new problem on to our children and grandchildren.\n  A story a couple of days ago in the Washington Post was headlined \n``After Bush Leaves Office, His Budget Costs Balloon.'' I want to read \na few lines from that story.\n  It warned that ``the numbers released in recent days add up to a \nbudgetary landmine that could blow up just as the next president moves \ninto the Oval Office.''\n\n[[Page S1443]]\n\n  Philip G. Joyce, professor of public policy at George Washington \nUniversity, said in the piece:\n\n       It's almost like you've got a budget and you've got a \n     shadow budget coming in behind that's a whole lot more \n     expensive.\n\n  And a Republican adviser to one of our colleagues said:\n\n       Hopefully some very difficult decisions will be addressed \n     between now and the time we have a new White House resident \n     so that occupant isn't faced with some very expensive \n     chickens coming home to roost. There are some things that we \n     can do, but unfortunately in the political world kicking down \n     the road is often seen as leadership.\n\n  That is what kicking down the road is going to give us. That says it \nall.\n  This huge new debt is not the only bad part of privatization. In \nfact, we need to remember this plan that is being put forward does \nnothing to extend Social Security solvency--not for a year, a day, not \nfor an hour. That is the issue we are trying to solve. The President's \nplan, at least the part he has been willing to share with us, does not \naddress that. It is an ideological gamble that we in the Senate and \nthose who depend on Social Security today and tomorrow and around the \ncountry should not stand for.\n\n  Rather than gambling away our security and running up this huge new \ndebt, we should promote personal savings to help every American with \ntheir retirement security and we should stop raiding the Social \nSecurity trust fund to pay for misguided priorities such as massive tax \ncuts for the wealthy.\n  The ideas we have heard from the President are too dangerous for this \ngeneration's retirees or those who are to follow. As you can imagine, \nlike all of my colleagues, I have heard a lot about this proposal from \nmy constituents in Washington. I have heard from current retirees, from \ndisabled workers whom we have not even begun to talk about how this \nplan will affect, and from young people who would supposedly benefit. \nPresident Bush would be very surprised by the tremendous number of \ncomments I have been getting and the tone of them. I will share a few.\n  From a retiree who lives on Whidbey Island:\n\n       The administration should be ashamed of its effort to \n     confuse and mislead the hard-working citizens of the United \n     States.\n\n  I heard from a 20-something, who supposedly is going to benefit from \nprivatization, who said:\n\n       I want Social Security to be left in its current form.\n\n  I heard from a 51-year-old self-employed fisherman who said:\n\n       My main concern about Social Security is that it survive \n     for my children. The risks are simply too great for the \n     future of our citizens and our country.\n\n  I agree with him. This plan is a plan for social insecurity. It is a \nguaranteed gamble, not a guaranteed benefit. We are going to continue \nto stand up for future generations, the young people who are following \nus, against a private solution that simply will add trillions of \ndollars in debt to the future generations we are supposedly thinking \nabout here in the Senate.

Mr. President, my staff just brought to my attention a \npublication from the Republican Policy Committee, which our colleague, \nSenator Kyl of Arizona, chairs. It is on their Web site. I found it \ninteresting because it is a description of the Democrat's Social \nSecurity plan. What is interesting about this so-called bill, as \ndescribed by Senator Kyl and the Republican Policy Committee, is that \nit does not exist.\n  They go on to describe this so-called bill by the Democrats which, \naccording to the Republicans, will require new borrowing or tax \nincreases of $5.8 trillion between 2018 and 2042. This does not exist. \nWhat I hold in my hand and what is on the Republican Policy Committee \nsite is a complete fabrication. There is no truth to this.\n  It surprises me that my colleagues will reach a point where they \nwould put this into the public discussion--try to--when they know it is \nnot true.\n  Let's try to recap where we are on the debate about Social Security. \nIt was President Bush who told us we needed to talk about Social \nSecurity. It was President Bush who told us we face a crisis, a \nchallenge, a bankruptcy in Social Security. It was the President who \nsaid we needed to privatize Social Security. It was the President's \nleadership who brought us to this point in the discussion. And many of \nus are still waiting for the President's bill.\n  The President has spoken about Social Security. Some of his \ncolleagues and friends on the Republican side of the aisle have \napplauded his suggestions, but as yet we have not seen President Bush's \nproposal. What we know about it concerns us.\n  Instead of strengthening Social Security, President Bush's \nprivatization plan will weaken Social Security. Let me be specific.\n  A memo is released from the White House. It suggests changing the \nindexing rate for Social Security. That is the rate of inflation and \nother increases in the outyears. So we put the calculation together. \nWhat if you change the index from the wage index to the price index?\n  We find out that in a few decades, we would be cutting Social \nSecurity benefits by 40 percent. President Bush's proposal is to cut \nSocial Security benefits by 40 percent.\n  How does that strengthen Social Security? It weakens it. For many \nseniors, it means they are going to be tipped over the edge. They are \ngoing to end up with less money from Social Security, despite a \nlifetime of contributions. So there is the first weakness.\n  The second weakness is the President wants to take money out of the \nSocial\n\n[[Page S1444]]\n\nSecurity trust fund for these so-called private accounts, and as he \ntakes the money out of the Social Security trust fund, it creates a \ngreater deficit in America, a greater debt. This debt, of course, has \nto be paid off. We have to borrow money to make up for the amount the \nPresident wants to take out of the Social Security trust fund.\n  How much is it? Well, the conservative estimates are less than $1 \ntrillion in the first 10 years but then up to $4 trillion or $5 \ntrillion in the second 10 years. So the President is heaping debt on \nfuture generations for this privatization of Social Security plan and \nhas no plan to pay for it.\n  So we have said to the President: Mr. President, you started this \ndebate; you told us we should act now. Where is your proposal? And he \ncannot produce it.\n  If one takes a look at the President's budget for America, one would \nexpect this is his highest priority, that the first chapter would be on \nSocial Security privatization. Well, search if one will, get a \nmagnifying glass, bring a bloodhound from the Westminster Kennel Show, \ntake whatever one can find, and they are not going to find it in his \nbudget. Highest priority for the Bush administration and not a word \nabout paying for privatizing Social Security in the President's budget. \nWhy? He cannot explain it. He cannot defend it. He cannot tell the \nAmerican people that what he is proposing will actually strengthen \nSocial Security.\n  As a result, people across America have said: Mr. President, we are \nnot interested in your approach. If the President's approach means \nweakening Social Security and not strengthening it, if the President's \nprivatization approach means substantial cuts in Social Security \nbenefits, if the President's privatization plan means $2 trillion to $4 \ntrillion more in debt for America, the American people, seniors and \ntheir families, are saying to the President, no, thanks.\n  That is not good news on the Republican side of the aisle. So because \ntheir plan is starting to fall apart and the support is not there for \nit, they have decided to go on the attack. The best defense is a good \noffense. So they want to attack the Democrats. Along comes the \nRepublican Policy Committee and completely manufactures and fabricates \na so-called Democratic bill that does not exist and says the Democratic \nplan is worse.\n  Well, I have news for them. November 2 was an important day in \nAmerican political history last year. That was the day of our national \nelection. If one wants to draw a parallel to a football game, there was \na coin toss. President George W. Bush won the coin toss and he will \nreceive. He received the opportunity to lead this Nation as a \nPresident. Now he has the ball and he has to run the plays. The \nPresident's theory about the game becomes the reality of governing, and \nthe President has to step forward and give us his plan, tell us how he \nis going to privatize Social Security and make it stronger.\n  Everyone says if one takes money out of the Social Security trust \nfund, it weakens Social Security. Most everyone agrees that adding to \nour national debt means we have to turn to other countries in the world \nto borrow money. Who is paying for the debt of America today? The No. 1 \ncountry in the world is Japan. Not far down the list we will find China \nand Korea. As we look at these countries, the mortgage holders of \nAmerica, it is no surprise that many of them are exporting more goods \nto America at the same time as they own our debt. The two go hand in \nhand. The actual deficit and the trade deficit go hand in hand. So as \nwe lose millions of manufacturing jobs across America, we lose them to \ncountries that are holding and owning America's debt: China, Japan, \nKorea.\n  What does this administration suggest we do? Go more deeply into \ndebt, borrow more money from these foreign countries, become more \ndependent on them in the hopes that some day they will not turn around \nand tell us, we do not want to buy your debt anymore? The only way we \nwill buy it is if you raise the interest rates, which, of course, \naffect our businesses, our families, and all of us as individuals.\n  This is an extremely shortsighted plan by President Bush. It is a \nplan which he has not brought forward in detail because he cannot \nexplain it. He cannot explain to the American people how weakening \nSocial Security is in the Nation's best interest.\n  The American people are wise enough to understand the reality. If we \ndo not touch Social Security, if we leave it exactly as it is today, it \nwill make every single promised payment, with a cost-of-living \nadjustment, every week, every month, and every year until the year \n2042. That is 37 years of payments from the Social Security system as \nit currently exists. There is not another program of Government that \none can say with certainty will make every payment for 37 years, but it \ncan be said about Social Security.\n  Can we do better and extend its life even longer? Of course we can. \nBut we will not reach that goal by creating this privatization of \nSocial Security, by attacking the very premise of Social Security.\n  The President says this is all about the ownership society. I think \nit is time for the President to own up about the ownership society. He \nought to be honest about it. What he is proposing in privatizing Social \nSecurity will not make it any stronger. What he is proposing is going \nto cut benefits. What he is proposing is going to end up in more \nnational debt.\n  This idea of the Republicans to come back and attack the Democrats \nfor legislation that does not exist shows how desperate their position \nhas become. Maybe it is time to call a timeout in the game I referred \nto earlier. Maybe it is time to do something totally radical. Maybe it \nis time to have a bipartisan conversation about Social Security. We did \nit before. I was here. Twenty years ago, Democrats and Republicans sat \ndown and asked: What can we do together in the best interest of Social \nSecurity? And we came up with a plan. With that plan, we bought more \nthan 50 years of solvency for Social Security. There were no bragging \nrights for Democrats, no bragging rights for Republicans. We did it for \nthe country, we did it for people and families who depend on Social \nSecurity. That is where we need to return today.\n  The privatization plan of the President is not going anywhere. People \nunderstand it is too great a risk. They do not want to play retirement \nroulette. They have invested for a lifetime in Social Security to have \na basic safety net of protection, and today they need it more than \never. Today, as corporations declare bankruptcy and walk away from \ntheir pension obligations, as they walk away from health care for \nretirees, there are certain things which we ought to say are protected \nin America. Social Security is one of them.\n\n  We need to come together as a nation and first make a commitment that \nSocial Security is going to survive and be strong; secondly, that any \nsavings incentives we create should not be at the expense of Social \nSecurity. We have a thrift savings plan for Federal employees. I am \npart of it. My family participates in it. It is a good idea. It is over \nand above Social Security. We pay into Social Security and with extra \nmoney pay into this thrift savings plan. I think it is a smart thing \nfor my wife and for my family. Other Americans could reach the same \nconclusion. There are ways to encourage savings but not at the expense \nof the Social Security trust fund.\n  The biggest problem the Social Security trust fund has today is all \nthe money that has been taken out of the Social Security trust fund by \nthis administration and others. When this President wants to pay for a \ntax cut for the wealthiest people in America, the money comes out of \nthe Social Security trust fund. Want to keep Social Security strong? \nPut the money back into the Social Security trust fund. Stop taking it \nout.\n  When we had a surplus in our budget, the future of Social Security \nwas even brighter. Today, with record deficits under the Bush \nadministration, it is no wonder we are worried about Social Security \nafter 40 years.\n  So I urge my colleagues, do not engage in this kind of political \ntrickery, trying to suggest that legislation exists which does not \nexist, trying to assign certain numbers and costs to a bill that does \nnot exist. It reflects very quickly how weak the President's proposal \nis.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/16/senate-section/article/S1445-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S1445]]\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina).

Under the previous order, there will be 90 \nminutes of debate equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add the \nfollowing members as original cosponsors of S. 384: Senators Coleman, \nCollins, and Santorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise this morning to urge support for S. \n384, a bill that would extend a very important law; that is, the Nazi \nWar Crimes Disclosure Act. This act launched a mission of discovery, \nand what we have learned from this bill has been extremely disturbing. \nIt has been necessary that we learn what we have learned from this \nbill.\n  I will take a few moments to talk about the act's specific merits, \nbut before I do that, there are some people I will thank. First, I \nthank the majority leader and his staff for allowing us time today on \nthe Senate floor to debate this measure. I also thank Judiciary \nChairman Arlen Specter for agreeing some time ago to schedule a hearing \nabout our bill. It was not necessary to hold the hearing, but it was \nimportant that he schedule it. It was his strong support for our \nefforts that allowed us to move so quickly on this issue. Senator \nSpecter gave a strong push to all involved to resolve their differences \nand to move forward so we could be in the position that we are today. I \nthank him for his leadership and for his support.\n  In 1998, Congress first passed the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act, \nwhich our friend and colleague the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan \nand I introduced, along with my friend Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, \nwho introduced it in the House.\n  The purpose of this law was to make public previously classified \ninformation about a terrible part of history, the history of Nazi \npersecution and also the relationship of the U.S. Government to the \nNazi war criminals in the aftermath of World War II and during the Cold \nWar.\n  The bill provided that we would disclose, within the constraints of \nnational security, the information we had about these Nazi war \ncriminals. Undeniably, the Nazi era was one of the darkest chapters in \nhuman existence and there is a natural tendency not to even want to \nthink or talk about it. Congress passed the Nazi war crimes law because \nwe understood that we owe it to all those who suffered and died in the \ndeath camps. We also owe it to their families to bring the whole truth \nto light.\n  The Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act has been in effect since 1998, and \nit has resulted in a tremendous amount of information. These results \nhave been produced primarily through the good efforts of a group called \nthe Interagency Working Group, also known as the IWG, which was created \nby that law. By statute, the IWG includes the director of the Holocaust \nMuseum, the historian of the Department of State, the Archivist of the \nUnited States, representatives from the CIA, FBI, Department of \nJustice, specifically the Office of Special Investigations, the \nDepartment of Defense, and three outside appointees, known as public \nmembers, who are Elizabeth Holtzman, Richard Ben-Veniste, and Thomas \nBaer.\n  The IWG also includes a number of professional historians and \narchivists, who, along with the public members and the other IWG \nmembers, took on the task of locating, identifying, and recommending \ndocuments for declassification, of course always provided as long as \nthe declassification posed no threat to national security.\n  At this point I think it is important to offer thanks to all the \nmembers of the IWG for their years of hard work on this project. The \nstaff, including the archivists and historians, has done remarkable \nwork and has helped to produce a tremendous amount of research on this \ncritical project. In particular, we owe a debt of gratitude to the \npublic members of the IWG--Elizabeth Holtzman, Richard Ben-Veniste and \nThomas Baer--who have worked without compensation and spent literally \nhundreds and hundreds of hours of their own time on this effort. We \ngive them our thanks. They have contributed mightily to the knowledge \nof this terrible era in world history.\n  Once the IWG was created, it worked closely with the CIA, the FBI, \nthe NSA, the Army, and a number of other agencies to examine and \nevaluate an enormous number of documents. In fact, since 1998, the \nInteragency Working Group has coordinated the single largest \nspecifically focused declassification effort in American history. In \nits first year of operation alone, the IWG screened so many documents \nfor possible declassification and uncovered so much work to do that \nCongress extended its life in 2001, under the leadership of Senator \nFeinstein, and then again with my sponsorship in 2004.\n  At this point, over 100 million documents have been screened for \npossible relevancy, and over 8 million documents have been declassified \nand used to create a book titled, U.S. Intelligence and the Nazis. This \nbook, which I have right here, now provides us with 15 chapters of \ninsight into the Holocaust and the post-World War II era--insight into \nwhat U.S. Government officials knew and when they knew it. It makes for \nabsolutely fascinating reading. We can be assured that, as more \ndocuments are uncovered and as historians have the opportunity to study \nwhat has already been uncovered, there will be more articles published, \nmore interpretation, more understanding of history.\n  When I came to the floor almost 7 years ago to introduce and help \npass the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act, I brought with me several \naerial U.S. intelligence photographs taken in 1944 of Auschwitz. In the \nphotographs, which were discovered by photo analysts from the CIA in \n1978, prisoners were being led into gas chambers. This confirmed that \nour government knew that these atrocities were occurring. What else did \nthey know? At that time, we could not be sure.\n  Now, however, due in great part to this law, we are much closer to \nanswering that question. The book has contributed to our understanding \nof history--much more so than we ever hoped. Let me tell just a couple \nof the many stories this research has uncovered.\n  Let me tell a couple of the many stories that this research has \nuncovered so far.\n  For example, the historians were able to examine a range of documents \nproduced by Gonzalo Montt, the Chilean consul in Prague during the \nearly 1940s. Montt was a Nazi sympathizer and, as such, appears to have \nhad significant access to Nazi plans regarding ``the Jewish problem'' \nand how the regime was planning to address it--and that plan involved \nmoving the Jews into ghettos, expropriating their assets, and \neventually eradicating the Jewish population.\n  British intelligence got access to many of Montt's dispatches to his \nhome government and provided them to the United States as early as \nMarch 1942. Under the law, the IWG recommended that these documents be \ndeclassified, and our government agreed. These documents show that \ncertain officials in our government had some evidence of Nazi \nintentions toward the Jews at least 6 months earlier than had \npreviously been known.\n  Further, as the authors, themselves, say, these documents show again \nthat:\n\n     for many Americans and Britons inside and outside of \n     government, the central, overriding concern during 1939-1945 \n     was the war, itself--not the barbaric policies that \n     accompanied it.\n\n  Our job in Congress, at least in passing the law, was not to judge \nhistory. That is up to historians. That is up to the people who read \nit. That will be up to us, later on. As these documents come out, we \ncan begin to judge it.\n\n[[Page S1446]]\n\n  The point is, though, to make this information available, to let the \ntruth come out, whatever that truth is. Let these raw documents come \nout to let people make judgments based on those documents. Let \nhistorians view it. Let historians argue about them. But to get those \ndocuments out in front of the historians and, ultimately, in front of \nthe American people and in front of the world.\n  We learn from history. We learn from the truth. What this bill is \nabout is getting out the truth.\n  Other documents showed other details. For example, in a chapter \nwritten by Professor Norman J.W. Goda, a professor at Ohio University, \nthe book details how the German government, in coordination with a \nnumber of U.S. and European banks, worked together to funnel money \nillegally expropriated from the accounts of German Jewish nationals \nback to Germany. Although the details are somewhat complex, in essence, \nthe German government used these expropriated assets to lure a prior \ngeneration of German immigrants back to Germany from the United States \nand, essentially, invest in the German war effort.\n  A large U.S. bank was intimately involved in this scheme, and \nprofited greatly from it. The scheme was discovered in late 1940 by the \nFBI, and it began a lengthy investigation. Rather than shut down the \noperation, the Bureau surveilled the many participants and eventually \ndid arrest a large number of them. At some point during the \ninvestigation, the bank, itself, did cooperate with the investigation \nand was never prosecuted in order to protect FBI and Army intelligence \nsources. Until this project began, this story had never fully been \nexposed.\n  As this book shows and those stories illustrate, this project has \nbeen a great success, and the IWG has been very effective at their \ntask--but the law is due to expire at the end of March and the IWG \nneeds more time. Unfortunately, during the course of the last year, the \nIWG and the CIA have had several ongoing disagreements about the \ncorrect interpretation of the law and what type of disclosure the law \nrequires.\n  After a great deal of effort, the parties have finally come to a \ncommon understanding of what the law requires. Specifically, it is now \nunderstood that the law was drafted broadly, so that as much \ninformation as possible may be released--both about specific Nazi war \ncrimes and also about the relationship the U.S. Government had with \nNazi war criminals in the post World War II and Cold War era.\n  With this understanding going forward, the various parties who \ncomprise the IWG agree that there is a need for some more time to \nconclude their important work, and I agree, as well. Accordingly, \nyesterday I introduced, along with Senators Feinstein and Cornyn, \nlegislation that will extend the life of the IWG for 2 additional \nyears, until March 2007. Both the IWG and the CIA agree that 2 years is \na reasonable amount of time for the extension, and I agree.\n  I hope and expect that well within those 2 years, the IWG, working \nclosely with the CIA, will be able to examine the remaining documents \nand release the important information that still lays within the files \nof the CIA--unexamined by the public until now. We have come a long way \nand told a large part of the story, and it is time to finish the job.\n  Finally, I would like to note for the record the contributions of the \nmany people who have helped us to get to where we are today. Once \nagain, Senator Specter, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, was \ninstrumental in putting the power of the Judiciary Committee behind our \neffort to move this issue quickly. I also would like to thank Senator \nLeahy, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, who has been a \nleader on this issue since the beginning, along with our co-sponsors on \nthe Committee, Senator Feinstein and Senator Cornyn.\n  In the House of Representatives, as I mentioned earlier, \nRepresentative Carolyn Maloney has been my counterpart and the leader \non this issue since the beginning. I look forward to working with \nRepresentative Maloney and with Chairman Davis, Chairman Sensenbrenner \nand Chairman Hoekstra to help move this legislation in the House.\n  Of course, I also must recognize the commitment, dedication, and \nvision of the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. He spent countless \nhours involved in this issue. He knew how important this was to \ndeepening our understanding of history. He appreciated the value of \nuncovering this information and what it would mean to those who \nsuffered through the Holocaust and their families.\n  I also must mention that the CIA, of course, has played a critical \nrole in resolving this dispute and moving forward toward the completion \nof this project. I'd like to thank former DCI George Tenet for his \nefforts in that regard and, in particular, mention current DCI Porter \nGoss, who, as a Congressman from Florida, was a cosponsor of the \noriginal legislation in the House. Again, as I noted earlier, the \nmembers and staff of the IWG, including the public members, deserve our \nspecial thanks.\n  I should mention again the efforts of leadership and Floor staff, \nparticularly Sharon Soderstrom and Laura Dove, for helping to move this \nlegislation so quickly and make sure we had the opportunity to consider \nit prior to the expiration of the IWG next month.\n  Finally, on a personal note, I thank the staffs of all of the Members \nwho have played such a large role on this issue. In particular, I would \nlike to recognize the contributions of my former Judiciary Committee \nStaff Director Louis Dupart. Louis was a critical part of the team that \nhelped us turn this idea into law back in 1998. Even though he is no \nlonger working in the Senate, he has never stopped working to help \npromote this legislation and the effective implementation of the law. \nHis ongoing efforts have been crucial to the success of our efforts \nhere today.\n  Again I urge my colleagues to vote for this important and timely \nlegislation to extend our efforts to finally and fully open our files \nregarding this horrific period in history and give the victims of the \nNazi era and their families as complete an accounting as possible. We \nowe them no less.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am a strong supporter of this bill, and I \nam pleased to again work with Senator DeWine to help ensure that our \ngovernment discloses what it knows about Nazi war criminals and their \ncounterparts in the Japanese Imperial Government.\n  We passed the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act in 1998, and I had the \nopportunity to work on the bill in the Judiciary Committee. The act \nrequired U.S. Government agencies to disclose documents in its \npossession that related to Nazi war criminals and was later expanded to \ncover the Japanese Government. Congress took care to respect legitimate \nnational security concerns, including exemptions to allow agencies to \nwithhold documents under a variety of circumstances, provided they \nreported such withholding promptly to the relevant committees.\n  The act also established the Interagency Working Group, IWG, to study \nand report on the documents held by government agencies. Through no \nfault of its own, the IWG has not been able to complete its work, and \nthe legislation before us today would extend its life for an additional \n2 years.\n  President Clinton instructed agencies to comply fully and rapidly \nwith the act. Most have done so. The Central Intelligence Agency, \nhowever, has until recently insisted on a cramped interpretation of the \nstatute that did not accord with congressional intent. The CIA's \napproach if left unquestioned would have denied researchers and the \nAmerican people a complete accounting of U.S. Government information \nabout Nazi war criminals.\n  The plain reading of the act says that if the CIA, or any other \nagency, possesses documents relating to war criminals, all such \ndocuments must be disclosed unless a specific statutory exemption \napplies. I understand that the FBI, the Army, and other agencies \ncovered by the law adopted that interpretation. The CIA, however, took \nthe position that it must disclose only those documents directly \nrelating to the individual's criminality.\n  In recent weeks, however, under the continued prodding of Senator \nDeWine and the public members of the IWG, the CIA has agreed to revise \nits interpretation of the law and provide the IWG with the additional \ndocumentation it has sought. Richard Ben-\n\n[[Page S1447]]\n\nVeniste, Elizabeth Holtzman, and Tom Baer, the public members, deserve \nour thanks for their persistent efforts to uncover the whole truth \nabout the criminals of World War II that is contained in U.S. \nGovernment files.\n  In addition to providing additional information, the CIA must also \ncomply with its obligation under the act to report to the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and the House Government Reform Committee whenever \nit invokes an exemption to avoid disclosing documents. Seven years \nafter enactment, we have yet to receive any such report from the CIA, \neven as it declined to disclose a number of documents sought by the \nIWG.\n\n  The enactment of this law was an important victory for openness in \ngovernment, and it is critical that all agencies offer full compliance. \nI have been a strong supporter of the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, \nthroughout my service in the Senate, and in fact worked to ensure that \nthe Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act would not inadvertently reduce \nagencies' ordinary obligations under FOIA.\n  The actions of this body today are a welcome departure from our \nsometimes complacent attitude toward secrecy. Indeed, I believe this \nCongress has been all too willing to accept the secretive ways of the \nBush administration. The Bush White House has conducted its \npolicymaking behind closed doors to an unprecedented degree, from the \nenergy task force to the construction of the legal regime that would \ngovern the war on terror. When we have sought to exercise our oversight \nresponsibilities, we have frequently been stonewalled.\n  This stonewalling is most apparent in the administration's refusal to \ndisclose information about the abuse of detainees in Afghanistan, Iraq, \nand Guantanamo Bay. Nearly 10 months after the world learned of the \natrocities at Abu Ghraib, those of us in the Congress who strongly \nbelieve that oversight and accountability are paramount to restoring \nAmerica's reputation as a human rights leader remain stymied in our \nefforts to learn the full truth about how this administration's \npolicies trickled down from offices in Washington to cellblocks in Abu \nGhraib.\n  We know that the CIA is reluctant to provide documents related to \nNazi war criminals that are 50 years old and older. How can we expect \nthe same agency to willingly disclose information that might implicate \nits own agents for recent violations of international law? The \nadministration contends that the prisoner abuse scandal has been fully \ninvestigated, yet we continue to learn about new abuses in the press. \nSeveral reports, including a recent article by Jane Mayer in The New \nYorker, detail the CIA's use of extraordinary rendition to transfer \nterrorism suspects in U.S. custody to the custody of countries where \nthey are likely to be tortured, a practice expressly prohibited by \ninternational law. Other recent reports describe how female \ninterrogators at Guantanamo repeatedly used sexually suggestive tactics \nto try to humiliate Muslim prisoners. To fully understand this sad \nchapter in our Nation's history, there needs to be an independent \ninvestigation of the actions of those involved, from the people who \ncommitted abuses to the officials who set these policies in motion.\n  Even without an independent investigation, we know the genesis of \nthis scandal began in Washington, not Abu Ghraib. Based on flawed legal \nreasoning that was contrary to the advice of the State Department and \nmilitary lawyers, the President determined more than 3 years ago that \nsuspected members of al-Qaida were not entitled to any protections \nunder the Geneva Conventions. Unfortunately, this decision traveled \ndown the chain of command and led to the abuses we have seen in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and Guantanamo Bay.\n  The President's decision to deny suspected terrorists Geneva \nConventions protections is particularly relevant as we discuss the Nazi \nWar Crimes Act. It was in August 1949, in response to the Nazi \natrocities committed during World War II, that the international \ncommunity adopted the Geneva Convention on Rules of War. The United \nStates and most other nations of the world ratified the Conventions to \nensure that, even in times of war, all nations would be bound by the \nrule of law. More than fifty years later, we must now investigate our \nNation's failure to remain committed to these laws.\n  Finally, as we discuss the commission of war crimes from the World \nWar II era, I would like to note the passage in December of the Anti-\nAtrocity Alien Deportation Act, which was included in the National \nIntelligence Reform Act. This law, which has already been employed to \nbring removal proceedings against a former Ethiopian government \nofficial who has been convicted of torture there, expands the grounds \nunder which we can deport or deny entry to those who have engaged in \nwar crimes and other serious violations of human rights abroad. I began \nintroducing this bill in 1999, but it was only in 2004 that we were \nfinally able to overcome the opposition of some House Judiciary \nCommittee Republicans, with the great help of the lead sponsor of the \nHouse companion bill, Representative Mark Foley of Florida.\n  I support the extension and full compliance with the Nazi War Crimes \nDisclosure Act.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of legislation \nto authorize the extension of the Nazi War Crimes Records Disclosure \nAct and the Japanese Imperial Army Disclosure Act for an additional 2 \nyears.\n  In 1998, Congress passed the Nazi War Crimes Records Disclosure Act \nto ensure that the records of our national security and intelligence \nagencies related to the criminal activities of the Nazi regime could, \nafter more than half a century, become public.\n  During the 106th Congress, I introduced, and the President signed \ninto law, the Japanese Imperial Army Disclosure Act which expanded the \nscope of the original statute to cover war crimes that occurred in the \nPacific theater.\n  That legislation was sought by a large number of Californians who \nbelieved that there was an effort to keep information about possible \nJapanese Imperial Army abuse of war prisoners from the public record.\n  Indeed, both pieces of legislation were much needed because many of \nthe records and documents regarding Germany's and Japan's wartime \nactivities were classified and hidden in U.S. government archives and \nrepositories. Even worse, according to some scholars, some of these \nrecords were being inadvertently destroyed.\n  The statutes were designed to work through an Interagency working \ngroup which would ensure that the documents that needed to be \ndeclassified would be declassified, and that the process would occur in \nan orderly and expeditious manner.\n  At the time, it was recognized that there could be circumstances \nwhere classification was still appropriate, so the best way for the \nworking group to conduct its work was to do so in coordination with \nother agencies. What we did not recognize was the bureaucratic setbacks \nthat the working group would encounter.\n  The bottom line here is that the working group did its part and tried \ndiligently to meet its deadline. Nevertheless, despite the group's best \nefforts, it appears that delay and confusion on the part of the CIA \nhave obstructed its progress.\n  As a result, the working group, through no fault of its own, was \nunable to complete this important work within the timetable that the \nlegislation contemplated and now requires additional time to finish.\n  I find this to be very unfortunate because the time has already long \nsince passed for the full truth to come out.\n  However, I have been assured that the intelligence community, in \ngeneral, and the CIA, in particular, have a renewed understanding of \nthe importance of this matter and will now work expeditiously with the \nworking group until the work is completed.\n  With the fast-thinning ranks of our brave American World War II \nveterans, it is all the more imperative that the truth comes out \nsooner, not later. Especially for those that were the victims of war \ncrimes, there should be a full accounting of what happened so that old \nwounds have a chance to heal.\n  We need to pass this legislation now so the working group can finish \nthe work that it has started before it is too late. Our veterans gave \nand risked their lives for this country. The least we can do is provide \nthem with the truth before they are all gone.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S1448]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor an individual who \nis a credit to his nation, his government, and the office in which he \nserves. He has earned the admiration and appreciation of his staff, the \nrespect of his colleagues, and the friendship of many of us here in \nWashington. Sadly, he is also a man whose current service in our \nNation's Capital has come to an end, and he will soon be departing to \nreturn home. The man I am speaking of this morning is Canada's \nAmbassador to the United States, Mr. Michael Kergin.\n  At the end of February, Ambassador Kergin will be returning to Canada \nafter serving admirably here in Washington for the past 4-plus years. \nHe assumed his position in October of 2000, just the 19th \nrepresentative to the United States for our northern neighbor--our \neastern neighbor for those of us in Alaska. His background prior to \nserving as Ambassador to the United States is impressive.\n  He was born in a Canadian military hospital in England. Ambassador \nKergin joined the Canadian Department of External Affairs in 1967. He \nserved in New York, Cameroon, and Chile. He was Ambassador to Cuba from \n1986 to 1989. In 1998, Ambassador Kergin was asked by Prime Minister \nJean Chretian to serve as his Foreign Policy Adviser as well as \nAssistant Secretary to the Cabinet for Foreign and Defense Policy--the \nequivalent of our National Security Adviser.\n  It is from this background that Ambassador Kergin drew when the \nterrorists attacked on September 11, 2001. If you were to ask the \nAmbassador about his most memorable activities while here in \nWashington, working with his U.S. counterparts to prevent further \nterrorist attacks would rank toward the top of that list--taking our \nborder relations to the next level to fight terrorism by implementing \nthe Smart Border Process to keep terrorists out while allowing for the \nlegitimate flow of commerce and visitors between our nations.\n  It is appropriate to remember, as we are again considering \ncomprehensive energy legislation, that Ambassador Kergin played a key \nrole in the aftermath of the August 2003 blackout that hit the \nNortheast through the Canada-United States Power Outage Task Force, \nwhich was to improve our integrated electricity grid.\n  I would also be remiss if I did not mention the Ambassador's work to \ndevelop natural gas pipelines from both Canada's MacKenzie Delta and \nAlaska's North Slope to meet our common energy needs.\n  Mr. President, many of my colleagues from the West are quick to point \nout the differences between Eastern and Western United States. Canada \nis much the same. And when you look at a map, it is readily apparent \nthat the seats of government for both nations are very much in the \nEast. So it was a pleasant surprise for me when I first met Ambassador \nKergin to learn that he was from British Columbia. When Alaskans speak \nabout fishing or timber or mining issues, he gets it. He understands \nthe Alaskans' point of view.\n  I look forward to working with Ambassador Kergin's successor, but I \nwill also miss the good Ambassador's presence here in Washington, DC.\n  So I would like to say to him: Mr. Ambassador, thank you for your \nservice in our Nation's Capital, and thank you for your willingness to \nwork so closely with Congress and the American people to continue our \nstrong relationship.\n  With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for 15 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/16/senate-section/article/S1448-3", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1448-S1452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GLOBAL WARMING\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, today marks the entry into force of \nthe Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change. Following President Bush's \ndecision to opt out of ratification of that treaty, enforcement of the \nProtocol fell onto Russian shoulders and was finally ratified by the \nRussian Federation late last year. Today it is a legally binding \ntreaty.\n  The basic climate change problem is well understood. We have been \ntold repeatedly in peer reviewed scientific assessments that increasing \nconcentrations of greenhouse gases will lead to an increase in the \naverage global temperature. The increasing temperature of the earth \nwill lead to a large number of important changes to today's climate \nsystem. Through past emissions and projected emissions over coming \nyears and decades we expect that the warming will accelerate unless the \nworld alters its emissions path. Indications of warming are already \nevident in the global temperature record. Last year was the fourth-\nwarmest year since temperature measurements began in the 19th century. \nThe warmest year on record was 1998, followed by 2002 and 2003. \nIndications are also evident in the vast changes now underway in the \nArctic and the bleaching of coral reefs around the world.\n  Over the years there have been many who have been skeptical of the \nscience that has informed us of the climate change problem. But the \nmainstream of the scientific community, as evidenced by panels \norganized through the National Academy of Sciences, has been quite \nconsistent in their views. Our doubling of the pre-industrial level of \ncarbon dioxide has been a major factor in increased global average \ntemperatures.\n  If human-induced global warming continues on its present path, the\n\n[[Page S1449]]\n\nchanges to our way of life could be vast. We know this from looking at \nclimates of the past as well as projections made by scientific models. \nThere would be significant changes in water resources, because \nprecipitation patterns will change. The sea level will increase because \nthe oceans will warm and will expand. The ice sheets of Greenland and \nparts of Antarctica could disintegrate, further adding to long-term sea \nlevel rise. A warming of the earth will place major ecological systems \nat risk, including many of our forests and coral reefs. We are \nessentially performing a global experiment with our planet, with \nincreasing risk to the future. A prudent course of action would be to \ntake steps now to lower these risks, while we continue to improve our \nunderstanding of the implications of the warming of our planet.\n\n  The desirability of taking prudent steps now, on a national and \ninternational basis, to stem global warming is further highlighted by \nother developments. Across the United States, an increasing number of \nindividual States are taking policy steps related to global warming. \nCalifornia and New York are moving forward with innovative programs to \ndo their part in minimizing emissions. Add into the mix States like \nPennsylvania, Colorado, Texas, Minnesota and others and you can see \nthat a patchwork quilt of climate policies is being formed across the \nUnited States. While States can be a great laboratory of ideas, the \ndeveloping situation really calls out for Federal leadership to get to \na more coordinated and rational approach across the country.\n  The business community is looking for federal leadership as well. At \na recent hearing before the Energy Committee, an industry economist \ncalled climate change a ``wild card'' that could shape energy markets \nand governance worldwide. He testified that it would be ``prudent to \ntake preparatory steps'' to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. He is not \nalone. Many U.S.-based multinational corporations are looking to the \nFederal Government for help as they seek to comply with the EU \nemissions trading scheme. More than 12,000 factories and power plants \nin Europe are subject to emissions caps, affecting many U.S. \nmultinationals with operations in Europe.\n  I applaud the hard work that has been done by many of my colleagues \non the issue of global warming. In past Congresses, we have seen \nproductive work both in terms of discrete bills, such as that by \nSenators McCain and Lieberman or the abrupt climate change bill by \nSenator Collins, or as part of large legislation, such as the \nbipartisan climate change titles in past comprehensive energy bills. It \nis clear that most Members of the Senate understand the importance of \nglobal warming. I hope that we will continue to work together this \nCongress on a path toward sensible climate legislation. For my part, as \nthe ranking member on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources, I hope that we can find a way to continue to integrate \nglobal warming concerns in energy legislation.\n  Energy legislation is an appropriate place to deal with global \nwarming. I have said many times that climate change is so closely \nrelated to energy policy because the two most prominent greenhouse \ngases--that is, carbon dioxide and methane--are largely released due to \nenergy production and use. To a large extent, to do energy legislation \nis to do climate legislation and vice versa.\n  As we consider climate in an energy context, I would like to lay out \nthree principles that I stand for and that I think are important. I \nthink that these principles are both modest and aimed at providing more \ncertainty to decisions that need to be made by the many actors who are \npart of our national energy picture.\n  The first principle is to have a sensible plan to reduce emissions of \ncarbon dioxide. I am very impressed with the recent proposal by the \nbipartisan National Commission on Energy Policy in this regard. They \nhave presented a well-thought out plan to create a mandatory emission \ntrading scheme that protects the economy and provides the essential \nframework for certainty.\n  Industry needs the certainty of a program that will help them make \ninvestment decisions for the future without causing them to prematurely \nretire capital stock. For example, I would bring to the Senate's \nattention the recent report of the Cinergy Corporation and their \ndetailed analysis of the implications of potential greenhouse gas \nregulations. They conclude that neither their company, nor their \nregion, nor this country would be endangered in the face of a modest \ngreenhouse gas emissions policy that includes a safety valve to protect \nagainst shocks to the economy. This approach has been championed by \nwell known economists such as Glenn Hubbard and Joseph Stiglitz, as \nwell as institutions such as Resources for the Future, the Climate \nPolicy Center and the Washington Post.\n  Protecting our economy will not come from ignoring the situation. \nLack of attention is as detrimental as legislation that is too \naggressive. The Energy Commission's proposal is the right mix of \nmodesty and certainty.\n  The second principle is to couple any emission reduction plan with \nrobust technology research and development and a broader energy package \nthat addresses energy supply from nuclear power, renewable energy, \nnatural gas, IGCC, and other sources. We need our approach to research \nand development to be strategic in the sense of creating new options \nfor dealing with greenhouse gases in an economic way.\n\n  The third and final principle I wanted to mention is the need to \nenact policies that affect emissions trends in developing countries, at \nthe same time that we try to deal with emissions trends here. EIA has \nprojected that we will soon be overtaken by the developing countries in \nterms of greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, these developing \ncountries are not required by the Kyoto Protocol to reduce emissions. \nThis has been a key point for opponents of the Protocol who are worried \nabout losing competitive advantage to countries with weak environmental \nstandards.\n  In terms of the long-term resolution of this issue and the \ncompetitiveness of the U.S. economy, it is essential that the United \nStates and developing countries coordinate action. One way to do this \nis to link progress in the United States to policies overseas. Here \nagain I point to the Energy Commission proposal that links progress on \nAmerican action to what is done by the international community.\n  Climate change is important to the international community. It is \nimportant to Prime Minister Blair and the other members of the G-8 who \nwill be meeting later this year. And, finally, it is important to all \nAmericans.\n  I intend to propose some sensible climate legislation at an \nappropriate point that is consistent with the principles I have laid \nout here.\n  I hope we can address elements of it in energy legislation as it \nmoves forward through Congress. We need to find a way to move forward, \nand I believe we can before this Congress concludes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that several items be printed in the Record: \nFirst, an editorial out of the Washington Post entitled ``A Warming \nClimate''; second, a letter from Glenn Hubbard, professor, Columbia \nUniversity, and Joseph Stiglitz, professor, Columbia University to John \nMcCain and Joseph Lieberman; third, a summary of the Report to \nStakeholders on air issues that has been developed by Cinergy \nCorporation; and finally, a summary of recommendations of the National \nCommission on Energy Policy entitled Ending the Energy Stalemate.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 28, 2005]\n\n                           A Warming Climate\n\n       For the past four years members of the Bush administration \n     have cast doubt on the scientific community's consensus on \n     climate change. But even if they don't like the science, \n     British Prime Minister Tony Blair, one of their closest \n     allies in Iraq and elsewhere, has given the administration \n     another, more realpolitik, reason to rejoin the climate \n     change debate: ``If America wants the rest of the world to be \n     part of the agenda it has set, it must be part of their \n     agenda, too,'' the prime minister said this week.\n       Mr. Blair's speech came at an interesting moment, both for \n     the administration's energy and climate change policies and \n     for the administration's diplomatic agenda. In the next few \n     weeks, the House will almost certainly vote once again on \n     last year's energy bill, a mishmash of subsidies and tax \n     breaks that finally proved too expensive even for a \n     Republican Senate to stomach. After a House vote, there may \n     be an attempt to trim\n\n[[Page S1450]]\n\n     the cost of the bill and add measures to make it acceptable \n     to more senators--including the growing number of Republicans \n     who have, sometimes behind the scenes, indicated an interest \n     in climate change legislation. Indeed, any new discussion of \n     energy policy could allow Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and \n     Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) to seek another vote on their \n     climate change bill, which would establish a domestic ``cap \n     and trade'' system for controlling the greenhouse gas \n     emissions that contribute to global warming.\n       If domestic politics could prompt the president to look \n     again at the subject, international politics certainly \n     should. Administration officials assert that mending fences \n     with Europe is a primary goal for this year; if so, the \n     relaunching of a climate change policy--almost any climate \n     change policy--would be widely interpreted as a sign of \n     goodwill, as Mr. Blair made clear. Beyond the problematic \n     Kyoto Protocol, there are ways for the United States to join \n     the global discussion, not least by setting limits for \n     domestic carbon emissions.\n       Although environmentalists and the business lobby sometimes \n     make it sound as if no climate change compromise is feasible, \n     several informal coalitions in Washington suggest the \n     opposite. The Pew Center on Global Climate Change got a \n     number of large energy companies and consumers--including \n     Shell, Alcoa, DuPont and American Electric Power--to help \n     design the McCain-Lieberman legislation. A number of security \n     hawks have recently joined forces with environmentalists to \n     promote fuel efficiency as a means of reducing U.S. \n     dependence on Middle Eastern oil. Most substantively, the \n     National Commission on Energy Policy, a group that \n     deliberately brought industry, environmental and government \n     experts together to hash out a compromise, recently published \n     its conclusions after two years of debate. Among other \n     things, it proposed more flexible means of promoting \n     automobile fuel efficiency and suggested determining in \n     advance exactly how high the ``price'' for carbon emissions \n     should be allowed to go, thereby giving industry some way to \n     predict the ultimate cost of a cap-and-trade system.\n       They also point out that legislation limiting carbon \n     emissions would immediately create incentives for industry to \n     invent new fuel-efficient technologies, to build new nuclear \n     power plants (nuclear power produces no carbon) and to find \n     cleaner ways to burn coal. Technologies to reduce carbon \n     emissions as well as fossil fuel consumption around the world \n     are within reach, in other words--if only the United States \n     government wants them.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              Columbia University,\n\n\n                                  Graduate School of Business,\n\n                                      New York, NY, June 12, 2003.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Russell Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators McCain and Lieberman: As Congress takes up \n     the issue of market-based systems to reduce emissions of \n     carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, we are writing to \n     encourage you to incorporate an allowance price cap sometimes \n     referred to as a ``safety valve.'' In the context of a cap-\n     and-trade system for emission allowances, a safety valve \n     would specify a maximum market price at which the government \n     would step in and sell additional allowances to prevent the \n     price from rising any further. Much like the Federal Reserve \n     intervenes in bond and currency markets to protect the \n     economy from adverse macroeconomic shocks, this intervention \n     is designed to protect the economy automatically from adverse \n     energy demand and technology shocks. While we disagree on \n     what steps are necessary in the short run, we both agree it \n     is particularly important to pursue them in a manner that \n     limits economic risk.\n       Our support for the safety valve stems from the underlying \n     science and economics surrounding the problem of global \n     climate change, and is something that virtually all \n     economists--even two with as politically diverse views as \n     ourselves--can agree upon. It is based on three important \n     facts.\n       First, unexpected events can easily make the cost of a cap-\n     and-trade program that includes carbon dioxide quite high, \n     even with a modest cap. For example, consider an effort to \n     reduce domestic carbon dioxide emissions by 5% below future \n     forecast levels over the next ten years--to about 1.8 billion \n     tons of carbon. This is in the ballpark of the domestic \n     reductions in the first phase of McCain-Lieberman allowing \n     for offsets, the targets in the Bush climate plan, and the \n     level of domestic emission reductions described by the \n     Clinton administration under its vision of Kyoto \n     implementation. Based on central estimates, the required \n     reductions would amount to about 90 million tons of carbon \n     emissions, and might cost the economy as a whole around $1.5 \n     billion per year. However, reaching the target could instead \n     require 180 million tons of reductions because of otherwise \n     higher emissions related to a warm summer, a cold winter, or \n     unexpected economic growth. Based on alternative model \n     estimates, it could also cost twice as much to reduce each \n     ton of carbon. The result could be costs that are eight times \n     higher than the best guess.\n       Second and equally important, the benefits from reduced \n     greenhouse gas emissions have little to do with emission \n     levels in a particular year. Benefits stem from eventual \n     changes in atmospheric concentrations of these gases that \n     accumulate over very long periods of time. Strict \n     adherence to a short-term emission cap is therefore less \n     important from an environmental perspective than the long-\n     term effort to reduce emissions more substantially. \n     Without a safety valve, cap-and-trade risks diverting \n     resources away from those long-term efforts in order to \n     meet a less important short-term target.\n       Finally, few approaches can protect the economy from the \n     unexpected outcome of higher energy demand and inadequate \n     technology as effectively as a safety valve. For example, \n     opportunities to seek offsets outside a trading program can \n     effectively reduce the expected cost of a particular emission \n     goal--which is beneficial--but that does not address concerns \n     about unexpected events. In fact, if the system becomes \n     dependent on these offsets, their inclusion can increase \n     uncertainty about program costs if the availability and cost \n     of the offsets themselves is not certain. Another proposal, a \n     ``circuit breaker,'' would halt future declines in the cap \n     when the allowance price exceeds a specified threshold, but \n     would do little to relax the current cap if shortages arise. \n     Features that do provide additional allowances when shortages \n     arise, such as the possibility of banking and borrowing extra \n     allowances, are helpful, but only to the extent they can \n     ameliorate sizeable, immediate, and persistent adverse \n     events.\n       To summarize, the climate change problem is a marathon, not \n     a sprint, and there is little environmental justification for \n     heroic efforts to meet a short-term target. Such heroic \n     efforts might not only waste resources, they risk souring our \n     appetite to confront the more serious long-term problem. \n     Absent a safety valve, a cap-and-trade program risks exactly \n     that outcome in the face of surprisingly high demand for \n     energy or the failure of inexpensive mitigation opportunities \n     to arise as planned. A safety valve is the simplest, most \n     transparent way to signal the market about the appropriate \n     effort to meet short-term mitigation goals in the face of \n     adverse events.\n       While trained economists hold divergent views on many \n     topics--as our own views demonstrate--economic theory \n     occasionally delivers a relatively crisp message that \n     virtually everyone can agree on. We believe this is one of \n     those occasions, and hope you will consider these points as \n     Congress addresses various climate change policies in the \n     coming months.\n           Sincerely,\n     R. Glenn Hubbard,\n       Professor, Columbia University, Chairman, Council of \n     Economic Advisers.\n     Joseph E. Stiglitz,\n       Professor, Columbia University, Chairman, Council of \n     Economic Advisers.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   Air Issues--Report to Stakeholders\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n       This report discusses the potential impact on Cinergy \n     Corp.'s operations and risk exposure should Congress pass \n     legislation requiring limits on the emissions of greenhouse \n     gases (GHGs), or if GHG emissions are otherwise limited by \n     treaty, regulations or judicial action. We have worked with a \n     respected shareholder group, Committee on Mission \n     Responsibility Through Investment of the Presbyterian Church \n     (U.S.A.), and Ceres to discuss the potential for eventual GHG \n     regulations and their consequences on the coal-fired electric \n     generating industry in general, and on Cinergy in particular.\n       Cinergy operates nine coal-fired generating stations and \n     burns almost 30 million tons of coal per year. We generate \n     approximately 70 million gross megawatt hours of electricity \n     for use by our 1.5 million customers in southwestern Ohio, \n     northern Kentucky and much of Indiana. Our newer stations, \n     representing 35 percent of our total generation, operate with \n     sulfur dioxide (SO2) scrubbers, while \n     approximately 50 percent of our generation has been fitted \n     with selective catalytic reduction equipment (SCRs), which \n     reduces nitrogen oxides (NOX) emissions. Our \n     operations are in full compliance with all applicable clean \n     air laws and regulations. We have recently announced a \n     significant construction program of additional emission \n     control equipment to comply with more restrictive pending \n     regulations.\n       The first comprehensive regulation of air emissions \n     occurred in 1970 when Congress passed the first Clean Air Act \n     (CAA) and established the Environmental Protection Agency \n     (EPA). The CAA has been amended at various times in the last \n     34 years, most recently in 1990.\n       Early regulations were based on ``command and control'' \n     that prescribed the maximum amount of a specified \n     ``pollutant'' a company was allowed to emit in a given time \n     frame from a particular unit. Command and control often \n     did not allow any flexibility or account for individual \n     characteristics in the age or type of coal-fired \n     generating stations. Command and control regulations also \n     failed to recognize other important variables that could \n     have lowered compliance costs.\n       In the 1990 CAA Amendments, Congress replaced command and \n     control regulations in certain air emissions programs with a \n     newer mechanism--``cap and trade.'' Cap and trade uses the \n     market to produce a far more efficient, least-cost approach \n     to achieving a prescribed level of emissions reductions. Cap\n\n[[Page S1451]]\n\n     and trade imposes a cap on the level of permissible \n     emissions, yet offers companies flexibility by recognizing \n     the large number of technical and operational differences in \n     regulated facilities. This flexibility allows generators to \n     make decisions based on economic and environmental factors \n     and provides incentives to reduce emissions below threshold \n     requirements. An emissions ``cap'' is achieved, but the exact \n     reductions occur where they are most economic. Emissions \n     ``credits'' are traded with units where reductions are not as \n     easily or economically achieved. The result, proven over the \n     last 14 years, is improved air quality at less cost to \n     electric customers than under command and control regulation.\n       In early 2004, the EPA proposed new rules to further \n     control S02, NOX and, for the first \n     time, mercury emissions from coal-fired generating stations. \n     The EPA proposed requirements after Congress was unable to \n     pass several emissions reduction bills presented to it, \n     including President Bush's Clear Skies Act. Cinergy expects \n     the EPA to finalize the rule further reducing S02 \n     and NOX emissions before the end of 2004 and \n     anticipates the final mercury rule to be issued by March \n     2005.\n       Presently, GHG emissions are not regulated, and while \n     several legislative proposals have been introduced in \n     Congress to reduce utility GHG emissions, none has been \n     approved. We anticipate the climate change debate will \n     continue into the 109th Congress, but believe it is unlikely \n     legislation requiring GHG limits will be passed in the next \n     two years.\n       Our costs to comply with these or other new environmental \n     regulations will depend on a number of factors, including the \n     timetables, levels of emissions reduction required, the \n     impact on coal prices and, most importantly, whether the EPA \n     will adopt a cap and trade or a command and control approach \n     to further regulation.\n       In anticipation of the proposed rules on S02, \n     NOX and mercury, in September 2004, Cinergy \n     announced the largest environmental construction project in \n     its history, asking state regulators to approve a plan that \n     would retrofit scrubbers and SCRs on generating units not \n     currently equipped with these devices. The company also \n     intends, as a pilot project, to install large scale mercury \n     control equipment at a generating station in southern \n     Indiana. The cost for the entire program is projected to be \n     between $1.65 and $2.15 billion through the next decade, \n     depending on whether the ultimate regulations adopt cap and \n     trade or command and control. This plan has been developed so \n     as to comply with a command and control regulatory scheme, \n     with the ability to reduce certain aspects of the plan should \n     cap and trade ultimately be the method of regulation.\n       The uncertainty Cinergy faces in the current regulatory \n     climate has made it difficult to plan the capital \n     expenditures we will need to make to comply with all \n     environmental requirements while continuing to serve our \n     customers' future energy needs in a reliable manner. \n     Overlapping regulations with differing implementation \n     timelines are inefficient and unnecessarily costly for the \n     company and its customers. Cinergy has asked Congress to act \n     and has urged passage of a long-term, multi-emissions bill \n     that would take the unnecessary uncertainty out of national \n     environmental policy.\n       Although we do not believe Congress will soon vote to \n     regulate GHGs, we remain hopeful that it will move forward on \n     legislation that provides greater certainty regarding the \n     levels and timetables for reducing emissions of \n     SO2, NOX mercury and particulates. We \n     do believe, however, as our CEO Jim Rogers has said, that we \n     eventually will operate our business ``in a carbon-\n     constrained world'' and that it is our responsibility to \n     prepare for that likelihood. We began that preparation in \n     September 2003 by launching a voluntary GHG emissions \n     reduction program, partnering with Environmental Defense and \n     in concert with the President's Climate Leaders program.\n       Cinergy's goal is to reduce our GHG emissions to five \n     percent below our 2000 level during the period between 2010 \n     and 2012. With our 2000 CO2 emissions at \n     approximately 74 million tons, we intend to reduce our \n     emissions to no more than 70 million tons per year through \n     the period 2010-2012. We have committed $21 million to \n     fund projects through the remainder of this decade to help \n     us reach this voluntary goal. We plan to achieve these \n     reductions despite a steadily rising demand for \n     electricity by our customers and greater internal needs \n     for electric generation to operate the pollution control \n     equipment being installed at most of our stations. Given \n     historical trends in electric demand, we estimate that we \n     will need to cut GHG releases by a total of 30 million \n     tons versus the business-as-usual case.\n       It is important to note that we must accomplish this goal \n     without access to a readily available CO2 control \n     technology. Unlike SO2 NOX, mercury and \n     particulates, there is no ``carbon machine'' that can remove \n     GHG emissions from our stations. Instead, we expect to meet \n     the goal by improving energy efficiency at our stations, \n     employing effective demand side management programs, adding \n     renewable energy to our generation mix, sequestering carbon \n     through forest preservation, purchasing allowances when \n     economically prudent and, possibly, sequestrating GHGs in \n     underground geologic formations. This latter program would \n     most likely be linked to a demonstration project at a utility \n     scale integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plant \n     that we considering for our next ``base load'' facility. \n     Cinergy recently announced a joint project with General \n     Electric Company and Bechtel Corporation to study the \n     feasibility of constructing an IGCC station in Indiana. We \n     expect that the IGCC plant will run more efficiently than \n     traditionally constructed coal-fired generation and will, \n     thus, contribute fewer CO2 tons per megawatt of \n     electricity produced.\n       Cinergy's expertise is also being deployed outside of our \n     legacy utility businesses. Over the last several years, we \n     have created two companies that provide energy management \n     services to a number of industrial and large commercial \n     customers. These services have resulted in significant GHG \n     emissions reductions and operating efficiencies for those \n     customers. To date, we estimate these programs have resulted \n     in the reduction of three million tons of GHGs.\n       We anticipate that our voluntary program will help us learn \n     about effective methods of obtaining GHG emission reductions \n     and help us comply with any future regulatory program \n     limiting GHG. Regardless of our planning, however, our \n     ultimate strategy for complying with GHG-restricting \n     regulations will depend greatly on the final direction and \n     timing of such requirements. A well-constructed policy \n     that gradually and predictably reduces emissions can be \n     managed without undue disruption to the company or \n     economy, though even the best plan will have rate impacts \n     on our customers. Much of the future impacts also depend \n     on how readily new technologies emerge, as well as the \n     response of the gas market and resulting gas prices.\n       Cinergy and its generating stations are similar to other \n     coal-fired utilities in our market region. Natural gas-fired \n     units in our region are typically the market's price \n     setters--meaning that they are the last units to be deployed \n     or ``dispatched'' to meet short term peak demand--so they \n     would not enjoy any particular advantage With CO2 \n     constraints unless gas prices were to drop dramatically, \n     which is a scenario we find highly unlikely. Nuclear and \n     hydropower stations will be well-positioned, though neither \n     is likely to displace coal-fired generation in the short to \n     medium timeframes because their capacity is fully utilized \n     now, with no new construction anticipated in the near term. \n     Renewable energy may well increase in the future, but there \n     are significant impediments, both technologically and \n     economically, before it will make much of an impact in the \n     Midwest.\n       Coal fuels more than 80 percent of the Midwest electric \n     market. We do not see it being displaced as the main fuel \n     source for electric production without what we believe would \n     be unacceptable economic and social consequences, not only to \n     the region, but to the entire nation. Although other \n     alternatives are likely to become more economic or practical \n     over time with technological breakthroughs, the nation cannot \n     dismiss a fuel that is as domestically abundant as coal. The \n     capital expenditures we are making at our stations today to \n     comply with the EPA's pending rules are prudent investments \n     because we expect that the generating units will remain \n     economically viable under any reasonable GHG program. We do \n     not believe the resulting price dynamics in the natural gas \n     market will render operation of our coal-fired generating \n     stations cost-prohibitive.\n       The preparation of this report demonstrates our desire to \n     inform our stakeholders of the GHG challenges we face as a \n     coal-fired electric utility company and to provide insight \n     into how we are meeting those challenges. Because we are a \n     stakeholder-focused company, it is our goal to weigh the \n     interests of all of our stakeholders and come to a balanced \n     result. Our customers, the communities we serve, our \n     employees, regulators, suppliers and most certainly our \n     investors have much at stake as we anticipate and begin to \n     prepare for the challenges we may face in a carbon-\n     constrained world.\n       We do not project that any of the current legislative \n     proposals would produce these higher prices in the short or \n     medium timeframe. However, this example manifests the \n     importance of developing a policy that does not force \n     reductions too quickly or otherwise limit flexibility and \n     international trading.\n     Risk of Very High CO2 Prices Unlikely--Though \n         Details Matter\n       It is our view that the very high range of prices shown \n     above would only be expected in the near term (20 years) if \n     sharp emissions reductions were required without being \n     preceded by a period of slowed growth followed by zero growth \n     or there were imposed limits on flexibility. Having said \n     that, the fact is we don't know what prices will be and the \n     risk remains. Should high CO2 prices emerge within \n     the next 20 years, they would flow through to electricity \n     prices because there would be no time to replace the \n     generation fleet with much lower emitting technologies that \n     do not rely on high-priced natural gas. Because electricity \n     prices play an important role in our manufacturing economy, \n     we think that policies that cause dramatic price increases \n     are not viable and, should they occur, would not last long \n     because of political reaction.\n       One strategy to protect consumers and producers from \n     CO2 price risks may be to assign price caps to \n     CO2 that increase over time--this is the so called \n     ``safety valve.'' Price caps will provide price certainty (or \n     at\n\n[[Page S1452]]\n\n     least protection from high prices) during the critical years \n     of program start up. This should be important to climate \n     change advocates because price shocks will likely result in a \n     program reversal or unwinding. An unrelated, yet telling \n     example is provided by the price shocks of the California \n     energy crisis, brought on by flawed deregulation. They \n     demonstrate how a program can be quickly scrapped if newly \n     created markets are subjected to dramatic price increases.\n       Escalating price caps should be given serious attention by \n     policy makers because of the following important points:\n       1. There is a broad range of uncertainty around forecasted \n     CO2 prices as reported by policy analysts. \n     Reported prices are only the single values within a broad \n     distribution of outputs that depend on what input assumptions \n     are made.\n       2. The actual prices generated by a real market will be \n     higher or lower than the reported numbers and will vary \n     depending on the supply-demand balance at any particular \n     moment.\n       3. If they happen to be quite a lot higher for a sustained \n     period, which is a real possibility, the program will be at \n     risk of being rolled back because of the economic pain \n     generated.\n       4. An escalating price cap will prevent this from \n     happening, while creating a less uncertain price signal for \n     those trying to make forward looking decisions.\n       5. An escalating price cap will serve as the program's \n     insurance policy, dramatically decreasing the risk of the \n     program producing very high prices that lead to its demise.\n                                  ____\n\n\n    Ending the Energy Stalemate: Reducing Risks From Climate Change\n\n       To address the risks of climate change resulting from \n     energy-related greenhouse gas emissions without disrupting \n     the nation's economy, the Commission recommends:\n       Implementing in 2010 a mandatory, economy-wide tradable-\n     permits system designed to curb future growth in the nation's \n     emissions of greenhouse gases while capping initial costs to \n     the U.S. economy at $7 per metric ton of carbon dioxide-\n     equivalent.\n       Linking subsequent action to reduce U.S. emissions with \n     comparable efforts by other developed and developing nations \n     to achieve emissions reductions via a review of program \n     efficacy and international progress in 2015.\n       The Commission believes the United States must take \n     responsibility for addressing its contribution to the risks \n     of climate change, but must do so in a manner that recognizes \n     the global nature of this challenge and does not harm the \n     competitive position of U.S. businesses internationally.\n       The Commission proposes a flexible, market-based strategy \n     designed to slow projected growth in domestic greenhouse gas \n     emissions as a first step toward later stabilizing and \n     ultimately reversing current emissions trends if comparable \n     actions by other countries are forthcoming and as scientific \n     understanding warrants.\n       Under the Commission's proposal, the U.S. government in \n     2010 would begin issuing permits for greenhouse gas emissions \n     based on an annual emissions target that reflects a 2.4 \n     percent per year reduction in the average greenhouse gas \n     emissions intensity of the economy (where intensity is \n     measured in tons of emissions per dollar of GDP).\n       Most permits would be issued at no cost to existing \n     emitters, but a small pool, 5 percent at the outset, would be \n     auctioned to accommodate new entrants, stimulate the \n     market in emission permits, and fund research and \n     development of new technologies. Starting in 2013, the \n     amount of permits auctioned would increase by one-half of \n     one percent each year (i.e., to 5.5 percent in 2013; 6 \n     percent in 2014, and so on) up to a limit of 10 percent of \n     the total permit pool.\n       The Commission's proposal also includes a safety valve \n     mechanism that allows additional permits to be purchased from \n     the government at an initial price of $7 per metric ton of \n     carbon dioxide (CO2)-equivalent. The safety valve \n     price would increase by 5 percent per year in nominal terms \n     to generate a gradually stronger market signal for reducing \n     emissions without prematurely displacing existing energy \n     infrastructure.\n       In 2015, and every five years thereafter, Congress would \n     review the tradable-permits program and evaluate whether \n     emissions control progress by major trading partners and \n     competitors (including developing countries such as China and \n     India) supports its continuation. If not, the United States \n     would suspend further escalation of program requirements. \n     Conversely, international progress, together with relevant \n     environmental, scientific, or technological considerations, \n     could lead Congress to strengthen U.S. efforts.\n       Absent policy action, annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions \n     are expected to grow from 7.8 billion metric tons of \n     CO2-equivalent in 2010 to 9.1 billion metric tons \n     by 2020--a roughly 1.3 billion metric ton increase. Modeling \n     analyses suggest that the Commission's proposal would reduce \n     emissions in 2020 by approximately 540 million metric tons. \n     If the technological innovations and efficiency initiatives \n     proposed elsewhere in this report further reduce abatement \n     costs, then fewer permits will be purchased under the safety \n     valve mechanism and actual reductions could roughly double to \n     as much as 1.0 billion metric tons in 2020, and prices could \n     fall below the $7 safety valve level.\n       The impact of the Commission's proposed greenhouse gas \n     tradeable-permits program on future energy prices would be \n     modest. Modeling indicates that relative to business-as-usual \n     projections for 2020, average electricity prices would be \n     expected to rise by 5-8 percent (or half a cent per kilowatt-\n     hour); natural gas prices would rise by about 7 percent (or \n     $0.40 per mmBtu); and gasoline prices would increase 4 \n     percent (or 6 cents per gallon). Coal use would decline by 9 \n     percent below current forecasts, yet would still increase in \n     absolute terms by 16 percent relative to today's levels, \n     while renewable energy production would grow more \n     substantially; natural gas use and overall energy \n     consumption, meanwhile, would change only minimally (1.5 \n     percent or less) relative to business-as-usual projections.\n       Overall, the Commission's greenhouse gas recommendations \n     are estimated to cost the typical U.S. household the welfare \n     equivalent of $33 per year in 2020 (2004 dollars) and to \n     result in a slight reduction in expected GOP growth, from \n     63.5 percent to 63.2 percent, between 2005 and 2020.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/16/senate-section/article/S1452-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1452-S1454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SMALL BUSINESS HEALTH FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Madam President, I am hopeful that later in the day the \nSenate will be able to take up the Genetic Nondiscrimination Act. It is \na bill I sponsored in the past. I know discussions are going on right \nnow about getting it done, and hopefully we will be able to get it \ndone. If that happens, it will be in no small measure because of the \nleadership of Senator Enzi, who has already shown in the brief period \nthat we have been in session a great ability to work with Senator \nKennedy and others on the HELP Committee to pass legislation.\n  I was moved by that to come down and to discuss another piece of \nlegislation that a number of us are discussing with Chairman Enzi. I am \ngrateful to him for his openmindedness to it and the discussions that \nhave been going on. I am talking about the Small Business Health \nFairness Act which the chairman of the Small Business Committee, \nSenator Snowe, will introduce today for herself and a number of others \nwho have sponsored this bill in the past.\n  I congratulate Senator Snowe on her great work on behalf of this \nbill. I am hopeful that we will be able to pass it this year in the \nSenate. It may be the most significant thing we can do to reduce the \nnumber of people in this country who do not have health insurance.\n  I want to talk about that for a few minutes. There really is no \nproblem in confronting small business and the economy greater than that \nproblem. It is everybody's problem, even if you have health insurance.\n  There are 44 million people in the country who do not have health \ninsurance. We have about 500,000 people in Missouri--about 10 percent \nof our State's population, a little less than that, including 70,000 \nchildren who get up and go to school without any health insurance \ncoverage.\n  Sixty percent of the people in the State of Missouri and around the \nUnited States who do not have health insurance are working people. It \nis a mistake to assume that most of these folks are people who are not \nemployed. They are not classically the disadvantaged people as we \nnormally think of that. Most of those folks we have made eligible for \nMedicaid, which certainly has a problem, but it is at least health \ninsurance coverage.\n  Health insurance costs have been increasing for small business \nemployers and their employees on average about 20 percent per year, \nwhich means this is not just a health access problem but a huge \neconomic growth problem as well.\n  Those small businesses that are providing health insurance are having \nto deal with these enormous costs every year. They will have to take \nmoney out of wages or out of investments in the business to try to keep \ntheir heads above water in terms of providing health insurance.\n  Over the years of my experience in the House and the Senate, I have \nencountered many such small employers. I have talked to hundreds of \ntheir employees. We have all done that. All of us, when we get around \nour States, hear about this problem. It is everywhere. It may be the \nbiggest day-to-day problem the average person in our State confronts, \nat least if they work for a small business.\n  Let me just tell you one story of a fine lady named Janet Hoppin from\n\n[[Page S1453]]\n\nMissouri. Janet owns a small business in the St. Louis area. She wants \nto do right by her five employees by providing them with health \ninsurance. Over the past few years, one of her employees became ill. \nShe contracted breast cancer. As a result of that, the insurance costs \nfor Janet's company have increased by $431 per employee per month, or a \ntotal increase over the last 2 years of 35 percent. Actually, it could \nhave been a lot more than that.\n\n  I have talked to people whose insurance costs have doubled or tripled \nover the course of several years, particularly if an employee actually \ngets sick and has the temerity to file a major health insurance claim.\n  Like most small business owners, health insurance costs for Janet \naffect the rest of her business. There is downward pressure on the \nwages and salaries of her other employees and her own salary. She has \nresolved this by taking it out of her own salary so she can continue to \nprovide health insurance for herself and for her employees.\n  There are many small businesspeople around the country who are doing \nexactly the same.\n  One of the bad things about this situation is because so many people \nwho work for small businesses do not have health insurance, it is easy \nto assume that small businesspeople just do not care about their \nemployees and that is why they don't provide health insurance. It is \nterribly unfair. They do care about their people. They work with them \nevery day. Most small business owners are employees of their own \ncompany. If they can provide health insurance to the company and the \nother employees, they will be able to get health insurance under a \ngroup policy rather than having to try to go out and buy it on the \nindividual market. It affects their ability to compete for employees.\n  For a while, when I was chairman of the Small Business Committee in \nthe House, I would meet with groups of small businesspeople and I would \nask them to raise their hand if they had lost an employee or had been \nunable to hire an employee because the employee wanted to work for a \nbig business that had health insurance. Whenever I asked that question, \nat least half of the people there would raise their hand. They have a \ndisadvantage of getting good employees because of their competitive \ndisadvantage in buying health insurance.\n  What do we do about it? Fortunately, there is a solution. The \nlegislation has passed the House I think 4 or 5 years running by large \nbipartisan votes. It passed the House by 100 votes the last time it \npassed. It is a solution that the President strongly supports. It is a \nsolution that had bipartisan sponsorship in this body last year. What I \nam about to say is not unimportant at the same time when we are all \nsuffering under a tight budget. It is a solution that doesn't cost the \ntaxpayers any money. It is not a Government program as such. It is not \nthe Government deciding to buy health insurance for somebody, or \nexpanding Medicaid. Those may be good things to do.\n  We do not have to do it here. We need to empower small business \npeople to do what the big companies already do. We need to allow them \nto buy health insurance as part of big national pools which will save \nmoney because the overhead costs, the administrative costs of buying \nhealth insurance, are a lot greater per employee for small businesses \nthan for big businesses. The reason for that is there are economies of \nscale in insuring large pools.\n  That is what the small business health plan would do. It would take \nadvantage of the same national structure currently used by 275,000 \nplans which already cover over 72 million people, including union \nmembers, people who work for Fortune 500 companies. The irony is that \neveryone else in the country, except the employees of small business, \neveryone else who has health insurance, has it now as part of a big \nnational pool, either private or public. Either you work for a big \ncompany--in Missouri at Anheuser-Busch or Sprint or Hallmark--and you \nare part of a big national pool or maybe you are a labor union member \nand you get it through one of their health and welfare plans or you are \non a public plan, in Medicare, a big national pool, or Medicaid or you \nare a Federal employee or a retired Federal employee.\n  There is a reason everyone else gets their health insurance as part \nof a big national pool. It is cheaper that way. It is administratively \neasier. The overhead costs are less. It is common sense to believe it \ncosts less to set up and administer a plan where you can spread the \ncosts over a pool of hundreds of thousands of people, rather than a \npool of 5 or 10 employees or fewer, which is what people such as Janet \nPoppin have to face every day today.\n  All we want to do is allow the trade associations, in which small \nbusinesses currently organize for other purposes, to sponsor national \nhealth insurance pools. The National Restaurant Association, as an \nexample, could go out, contract with insurance companies nationally, \nand then you join the restaurant association if you own a small \nrestaurant, as my brother does, and you become part of this big pool. \nThe easiest way to think of it is a small company would get health \ninsurance on the same terms and conditions as if you had been acquired \nby a Fortune 500 company. You become like a little division of that \ncompany. It would be exactly the same thing.\n  What would it mean for this country if at no cost to the taxpayers \nevery working person has access to health insurance as if they worked \nfor a Fortune 500 company? When I chaired the Committee on Small \nBusiness, we had a number of hearings on this. Senator Snowe has had a \nnumber of hearings. We estimate a reduction in the cost of health \ninsurance to small business of 10 to 20 percent, and for very small \nbusinesses it would be much less than that. For every percent you \ndecrease the cost of health insurance, many people become insured. \nSmall businesses, such as my brother's, who runs this little \nrestaurant, are in a position now to afford health insurance for their \nemployees and, by the way, for themselves because the owners of the \ncompanies are almost always employees of the company themselves and \nthey will go out and get health insurance this way.\n  Think of the savings from their perspective, not just in money but \ntime and effort. I use my brother as a example. He and my sister-in-law \nrun the place. Getting health insurance for their business means \nspending hours and hours soliciting bids, trying to work their way \nthrough it, making sure they are not cheated, dealing with all the \nlegal risks today of making a contract like that. They do not know \nwhether they might get sued for something if they contract with an HMO \nand there is a screwup. If you can join the restaurant association, \nthey send him the papers, the papers describe what options are \navailable for the employees, and he says I will pay this much for you, \nyou choose what you want.\n\n  It is easier, it is cheaper, it is safer. It will mean millions of \npeople who currently do not have health insurance coverage will get it \nand millions of others will get better, more secure, lower cost, higher \nquality health insurance--again, at no cost to the taxpayer.\n  There isn't any reason not to do this. We have been working with \nthose who have had concerns about solvency. How do we make sure these \nassociation health plans are solvent? That is a legitimate concern. We \nalready have in the bill tough standards to try and guarantee that. We \nwant to work with people to try and make certain that everybody is \nsatisfied on those points.\n  We can work our way through this and produce a bill that will make a \nbig difference for America. I am not the only one who thinks so. In \naddition to Senator Snowe and her great leadership, nine other Members \nof the Senate who cosponsored this bill last year, Association Health \nPlans, or the Small Business Health Fairness Act, strongly supported by \nthe administration, 170 organizations representing over 12 million \nemployers, and 80 million American workers support it. The coalition is \nas broad as the U.S. Chamber, National Federation of Independent \nBusiness, the American Farm Bureau, the Associated Builders and \nContractors, the Latino Coalition, the National Black Chamber of \nCommerce, the National Association of Women Business Owners. They all \nsupport it.\n  I mention the Farm Bureau. The Presiding Officer and I have a number \nof farmers in our States. One of the big problems they have is getting \nhealth insurance for themselves and their families. This is a classic \nexample of\n\n[[Page S1454]]\n\npeople trapped in a small group for individual markets situation. What \nif they could join the American Farm Bureau and become part of a pool \nof tens and tens of thousands of people?\n  In recessions, when people get laid off from big businesses--and I \nhave talked to many people in this situation--one of the biggest and \nmost immediate problems when you are laid off is what do you do about \nhealth insurance, particularly if you have kids. Many people are able \nto get another job pretty quickly, maybe with a small business, or they \nwant to start their own spinoff firm when they get laid off from a big \ncompany. This is increasingly common today, and a big problem they have \nis health insurance. What do they do about health insurance? A sole \nproprietor can join the Chamber of Commerce and the National Chamber of \nCommerce would be able to start an association health plan under this \nbill. You would be part of a pool of tens and tens of thousands of \npeople. You would not be at the mercy of a big company deciding it is \ngoing to cut your job.\n  I could go on and on on the subject. I am sure the Senate has become \nconvinced of that, if I have convinced Senators of nothing else. I am \nvery enthusiastic about it. I cannot compliment enough the work of \nSenator Snowe. Her leadership on this is crucial. Her credibility in \nthis Senate is great. She has taken the whole Small Business Committee \nin the Senate in the direction of supporting this. I am very pleased to \nbe helping her in this and grateful again to Senator Enzi for his open-\nmindedness. I cannot speak for him and do not want to, but I remember I \nwas presiding and the Senator from Wyoming was speaking about what he \nintended to do with the HELP Committee. He said his door was open; he \nwanted to hear ideas from Senators. He wanted to work with them. He has \nbeen as good as his word. I am grateful to him for that.\n  Let's do this. Members have concerns and we want to address them. I \nbelieve we can address them. This is too good an idea to pass up. There \nis no reason to. I have said for several years, what is the downside? \nSuppose we allow these associations, however they are constructed, to \nset up these association health plans, and it doesn't work as well as \nwe think it will work; they do not lower costs quite as much as we \nhope, and not as many people take advantage of them. What is the \ndownside? Not so many people use the plans as we hope will use the \nplans. There is no cost to the taxpayers. It is not as though we are \nspending billions and billions of dollars for something and if it does \nnot work, there is an enormous loss. We are giving people another \noption, the same option big companies already have. There is no reason \nnot to do it.\n  Let's work out whatever concerns we have, pass this on a bipartisan \nbasis as they have in the House, and empower our small business people \nand their employees to have health insurance and to have protection \nagainst these rising costs.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for as much time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/16/senate-section/article/S1454-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1454-S1456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SOCIAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are about to embark on a 1-week recess. \nMany of us will be back in our home States next week. I expect that \nmost of us will hold some kind of event or meeting to talk about Social \nSecurity with our constituents. I want to talk about that a bit today.\n  In the Senate, we deal with all kinds of issues, some big and some \nsmall. Sometimes we treat the big issues in a manner that suggests it \nis a rather small item. Sometimes we take a very small item and blow it \nup into something we suggest is very large.\n  On the issue of Social Security, my feeling is people on all sides of \nthis debate understand this is a very big issue with very big \nconsequences for the American people.\n  It will not be surprising that we will have very aggressive \ndifferences of opinion on how we should handle this issue of Social \nSecurity. The reason it is brought to our attention at this point is \nthe President is offering a proposal. He says the proposal is not \nspecific, and I agree with that, but it is specific enough for us to \nunderstand what he wants to do.\n  What the President has been saying--and the Vice President as well \nand others in the administration--is that Social Security is about to \nbe bankrupt, broke, flat busted, and any number of other words to \ndescribe that Social Security is about to fail.\n  As a result, the President says we should do the following: We should \nborrow a substantial amount of money now, anywhere from $1 trillion to \n$3.5 trillion or more, invest it in the stock market in private \naccounts, change the indexing of Social Security, reduce Social \nSecurity benefits, and with a combination of the remaining Social \nSecurity and his private accounts, people will be better off in the \nlong term.\n  Social Security was created in 1935. When Franklin Delano Roosevelt \nsigned that legislation, he talked about the legislation being able to \nlift people out of a poverty-ridden old age. At that point, one-half of \nour elderly were living in poverty. That is what was happening to our \ngrandparents: 50 percent in poverty; now it is less than 10 percent. \nWhy? Because Social Security has lifted tens of millions of Americans \nout of poverty in the last 70 years.\n  The President says Social Security needs to be changed because it is \nabout to be bankrupt. With respect, I say to the President that he is \nwrong. Social Security is not about to be bankrupt. Social Security has \nsome problems that are born of success.\n  What is the success? In a century, we have increased life expectancy \nin America from about 46 years of age to 76 years of age. We ought to \ncelebrate that fact. What a successful thing to have happen. Since \npeople are living longer, better lives, we have some strain on the \nSocial Security program. But it is not about to be bankrupt, and it \ndoes not require major surgery to fix it. It will require some \nadjustments as we proceed ahead, but it is not about to be bankrupt or \nflat busted. And it is not a cause to take apart what I think is one of \nthe most successful programs we have ever developed in this country to \nlift a large group of Americans out of poverty.\n  The President is not new to this position of private accounts. In \n1978, he ran for Congress in Texas. President George W. Bush, then a \ncandidate for Congress, said in 1978: Social Security will be broke in \n10 years. That is when he was a candidate for Congress. What was his \nremedy for that in 1978? Private accounts. Some things never change \nvery much.\n  The fact is, the President was wrong in 1978. Social Security did not \ngo belly up in 1988 as he predicted. And the fact is, he was wrong then \ncalling for private accounts in Social Security, and he is wrong now.\n  I happen to support private investment accounts such as IRAs and \n401(k)s. I have them and so do many Americans, and we have incentivized \nthem with tax incentives because we believe in encouraging people to \ninvest in the market and to save for retirement. But I do not believe \nwe ought to take a portion of the core insurance program--and that is \nwhat Social Security is, an insurance program, not an investment \nprogram--that provides the bedrock financial security for retirement.\n  We pay for Social Security principally through a paycheck deduction \ncalled FICA. That is your FICA tax. The I in FICA is for insurance, not \ninvestment; insurance, that is what it stands for. It creates an \ninsurance program for which you pay. Yes, part is retirement old-age \nbenefits, some is disability. Another part is for dependents, should \nthe wage earner die.\n  So it is more than just an old-age benefit. It has always been an \ninsurance program, and never an investment program.\n  The President says let's try to create an investment program out of \nSocial Security and begin to take it apart.\n\n[[Page S1455]]\n\nThe suggestion is, of course, that the investment portion of Social \nSecurity would always be wonderful.\n  Will Rogers once said his daddy told him how to do really well. He \nsaid his daddy said you should buy stock and hold it until it goes up, \nand then you should sell it. And he said if it does not go up, do not \nbuy it. So that was Will Rogers's description of how his dad suggested \nhe handle the market.\n  I suppose there is an element of that suggestion in Social Security \nbecause of those who say if one takes Social Security apart and creates \nprivate investment accounts, things will be just Nirvana, just fine. \nBut we all know better than that.\n  I believe there ought to be two major parts to a retirement program. \nOne is Social Security. Make sure it is there--it always has been. Make \nsure it works. We can do that. The second is the private investments \nthat we now incentivize to the tune of $140 billion each year in tax \nincentives to encourage people to invest in IRAs and 401(k)s and \nprivate pensions. I support both. Strengthen, improve, and keep Social \nSecurity, and provide additional incentives for private savings in \n401(k)s and IRAs.\n  I just described President George W. Bush's prediction about \nbankruptcy in 1978. He said Social Security would be bankrupt in 10 \nyears, by 1988. We have plenty of people who say it is going to go \nbroke, flat busted, on its back, bankrupt. They remind me of the \neconomists who predicted ten of the last two recessions. It is easy \nenough to walk around and claim these things. However, it is just not \naccurate to suggest that Social Security is about to go belly up.\n  What is true is that the taxes collected for Social Security this \nyear are expected to exceed the amount of money we will need to pay out \nin Social Security by $160 billion. We will have a surplus this coming \nyear in the Social Security accounts of $160 billion. That money will \nbe invested in U.S. Treasury securities.\n  The President has a fiscal policy that suggests we have large \ndeficits. I understand there are a lot of reasons for it, but I do not \nunderstand why we were not a bit more conservative earlier. I stood on \nthe Senate floor 4 years ago, and when the President said, We are going \nto have 10 years of surplus and we need to start doing big tax cuts \nright now, I and some others said maybe we should be a little \nconservative. Maybe we will not have 10 years of surplus. Maybe things \nwill change. Maybe something will happen we do not anticipate. Maybe we \nought to be a little conservative. No, Katey, bar the door, let us pass \nthese tax cuts.\n  What happened? We had a terrorist attack. We have had a war on \nterror. We have had a war in Iraq. A whole series of things have \noccurred that have changed the economic fortunes of this country. We \nwent from the largest surpluses in the history of this country to the \nlargest deficits. We are now the biggest debtor country in the world. \nWe have a budget in front of us with budget deficits that I believe are \npredicted at $427 billion this year. But that is not accurate at all \nbecause there is zero money in the budget for Iraq and Afghanistan. I \nwill be going to a hearing in about 10 minutes with Secretary Rumsfeld. \nThey are asking for $82 billion in emergency funding now.\n  So in the next fiscal year add another $82 billion for Iraq and \nAfghanistan--we are spending $1 billion a week--and that gets us to \nroughly a $500 billion estimated deficit next year. Then take the \nSocial Security surplus out of it because we cannot use those surplus \nfunds against the rest of the budget. It ought to be put in a trust \nfund, not counted. So then there is an honest deficit next year of \nabout $660 billion or so. That is where we are. That is where we start.\n  So the discussion is not just about Social Security. It is a \ndiscussion about values. I think most of us would agree that there are \na couple of things in life that are of primary importance to us. One, \nwe will do almost anything for our kids. If there is anything more \nimportant to any of us than our kids, I would like to hear what it is.\n\n  Second, we care a lot about what happens to grandpa and grandma. When \nthey reach that point in their life where they cannot work anymore, \nthey are dependent on what they might have saved, dependent on Social \nSecurity, the question is, How do we as a society make sure that they \nare not living in poverty as 50 percent of them were in 1935?\n  Some say there needs to be adjustments in Social Security and we \ncannot afford that. I say there will need to be some adjustments in \nSocial Security, but it is not major surgery. It is not major \nadjustments. The question is, if we cannot afford that, it is a matter \nof priorities. We are going to afford $82 billion just like that in \nfunding, I will hear from Secretary Rumsfeld about in a few moments. We \ncan afford funding for the one I saw this morning that piqued my \ninterest, Television Marti. This is unbelievable.\n  This morning I was looking through the budget. With Television Marti, \nfor people who do not know it, we broadcast signals to Cuba with an \naerostat blimp called Fat Albert. The purpose of using this blimp, Fat \nAlbert, to broadcast television signals into Cuba is to tell the Cuban \npeople how good things are in our country. Of course, they know that \nfrom listening to Miami radio stations, but they still want to send \nthem the television signal.\n  The fact is, Castro jams the television signals. So we broadcast \nsignals to no one. Cubans cannot get it. We have done that for many \nyears. We have spent nearly $200 million, and this year, to broadcast a \nsignal no one receives in Cuba, the President is proposing we double \nthe funding in the budget.\n  We cannot afford Social Security, we cannot afford this, cannot \nafford that, but we can double the funding for Television Marti to \nbroadcast signals to no one?\n  My point is, this is about values and priorities. I noticed in the \nplaybook on the Social Security debate that was given out to those who \nare supportive of the President's position says--this is the \ninstruction on communication: Do not say that Social Security lifts \nseniors out of poverty. People do not appreciate all that Social \nSecurity does.\n  That is what one is not supposed to say. But I said that earlier \nbecause I believe that is the fact, that Social Security lifts millions \nof seniors out of poverty. However, for those who support the \nPresident's program to take apart part of the Social Security system \nand go to a privatization system, they say do not say Social Security \nlifts seniors out of poverty because people do not appreciate all that \nSocial Security does.\n  I do not see it right here but another piece of the playbook that I \nfound interesting was, do not try to destroy myths. People have certain \nmyths about Social Security. One of the myths that bounces around the \nInternet every day all day and talk radio is that Members of Congress \ndo not pay Social Security taxes. In fact, that is one of myths that \nthis playbook mentions. When one hears that from people, do not \ndemolish that myth, let them think that. That tends to mess things up a \nlittle bit.\n  There was a leaked memorandum from the White House about 3 weeks ago \nby the architect of the Social Security plan. The person in the White \nHouse who is working on this plan had drafted this memorandum to all \nthe stakeholders in the administration saying, here is what we are \nwanting to do. The key point to it was this:\n\n       For the first time in six decades, the Social Security \n     battle is one that we can win . . .\n\n  The implication of that is quite clear. There are some who have never \nliked Social Security, never wanted Social Security to exist. They have \nnever had the opportunity to take it apart or repeal it, and this is \nthe first time in six decades that the Social Security battle can be \nwon.\n  One of the leading spokespersons on the far conservative rightwing \nsaid: Social Security is the soft underbelly of the welfare state.\n  It is not, of course. But that philosophy describes that there are \nsome who simply never liked Social Security, do not believe it ought to \nexist, and will support any effort to begin taking it apart.\n  My feeling is what we ought to do is decide as a Congress that there \nare two responsibilities with respect to retirement security. One is to \npreserve, protect, and strengthen the Social Security system for the \nlong term. According to Social Security actuaries, the Social Security \nprogram will pay full benefits from now until the year 2042.\n\n[[Page S1456]]\n\nAccording to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, if there are \nno changes made, the Social Security system will pay full benefits \nuntil the year 2052.\n  According to the analysts, the Social Security program will need no \nadjustments in the next 75 years if we have the kind of economic growth \nthat is predicted by the President and others, when they say you can \nget a 6 or 7 percent return in private accounts. If you have the \neconomic growth that produces that kind of return in the private \naccounts, you have the economic growth that means Social Security will \nexist without adjustments for the next 75 years. You can't have it both \nways. Either we are going to have, as the actuaries predict, \ndramatically lower economic growth than we have had in the past 75 \nyears, and that is about 3.4 percent average real economic growth, or \nwe are going to have the more pessimistic view of the Social Security \nactuaries in their recommendations, about 1.9 percent growth. If we \nhave 1.9 percent growth, you would not be able to pay full benefits--\nyou would only be able to pay 73 percent of the benefits after 2042. \nBut if that is the case, you don't have the economic strengths to \nproduce the corporate profits to lift the stock market to provide the \nreturn in private accounts. You can't argue both sides in the same \nquestion.\n  My belief, again, is we should preserve, protect, and strengthen the \nSocial Security system. It works. We know it works. It has lifted so \nmany millions of Americans out of poverty.\n  Second, yes, in retirement security we ought to do everything \npossible to say to all Americans who are working: You need to do more \nthan rely on Social Security. It will be there when you are ready to \nretire, but you need to do more than that. We want you to invest. We \nwant employers to offer retirement plans and we will provide incentives \nfor them to do that for their employees. We want employees to invest in \nIRAs, we want employees to invest in 401(k) programs, and we are \nalready providing significant incentives there. But I suggest we \nincrease them because it will be a complement to keeping Social \nSecurity as the core retirement insurance.\n  So, as I indicated, there are small matters and big issues before \nthis body. The question of what we do with the Social Security program, \nstrengthen it, preserve it, and extend it as a core social insurance \nprogram, or begin to take it apart and change it from an insurance \nprogram to an investment program--is a big issue. I stand on the side \nof believing that Social Security works. It has enriched the lives of \nsenior citizens in this country for decades and will continue to do so \nfor decades.\n  I also stand here saying that it is in my judgment a meritorious \nissue for all of us to care a lot about retirement security beyond the \nSocial Security program itself.\n  The one thing we should do and must do is all begin from the same set \nof facts. My colleague, the late Senator Moynihan, used to say everyone \nis entitled to their own opinion, but not everyone is entitled to their \nown facts. I hope as we work through and think through this great \ndebate on Social Security that we will at least agree on the basic set \nof facts. Those facts, I think, if read in a manner that represents a \nlevel look, will tell us this Social Security program has been an \nenormous success for this country and will be in the future as well, if \nwe have the strength and courage to do what is right to preserve it and \nstrengthen it.\n  I yield the floor and I make the point of order a quorum is not \npresent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune).

Mr. President, today we were visited on Capitol Hill by \nAlan Greenspan. Alan Greenspan is the head of the Federal Reserve and \nis considered the economics guru who comes to Washington periodically, \nto Capitol Hill, and gives us advice. Sometimes that advice is very \nwise and sagacious, and sometimes I think it is totally political--the \nsame Alan Greenspan who helped President Clinton with the task of \nreducing the deficit, the right thing to do.\n  President Clinton came up with a proposal which in fact reduced the \ndeficit, a deficit which through previous administrations of President \nRonald Reagan and President George Bush finally came to an end at the \nend of the Clinton administration. For the first time in modern memory, \nwe were generating surpluses in the Federal Treasury. All of that red \nink finally ended. We moved into the black. Mr. Greenspan was the \ninspiration for this initially, saying to the Clinton administration, \nget serious and get real about the deficit. We were anxious to listen \nto Mr. Greenspan in following years about what his advice might be.\n  Along came the Bush administration 4 years ago proposing dramatic tax \ncuts. The argument for the White House was, if you have a surplus, more \nmoney in the Treasury than you need, for goodness sakes, give it back \nto the people who paid it. That was the argument for the tax cut.\n  Many of us warned that sometimes the economy turns around, and things \nhappen you don't anticipate. If we are going to have tax cuts, we \nshould have some sort of a safety valve there. If things go badly, the \ntax cuts will not continue and drive us into deficit. Mr. Greenspan \ndidn't argue for that kind of caution at all, and the Bush White House \nrejected that notion.\n\n  What happened? Exactly as we anticipated--unforeseen circumstances; \nthe surplus disappeared, the tax cuts were there. Along came a \nrecession, followed by a war on terrorism, followed by the invasion of \nIraq and Afghanistan, in addition to the tax cuts still being on the \nbooks. That grand surplus disappeared into a deficit--the biggest \ndeficit in the history of the United States.\n  Now comes the President with a new plan. He says let us privatize \nSocial Security. Let us create private and personal accounts, knowing \nfull well that to do that you have to take money out of the Social \nSecurity trust fund so people can invest it in mutual funds. Some say \nthat is too risky. Regardless of whether it is risky, it does take \nmoney out of the Social Security trust fund and adds to the deficit.\n  In comes Mr. Greenspan today for more words of advice. We welcome him \nto Capitol Hill, but we wait patiently and anxiously to hear that same \ndeficit fighter of years ago comment on what we are seeing today. Where \nis Mr. Greenspan when it comes to these tax cuts that have driven us \ninto this deficit? Where is Mr. Greenspan when it comes to privatizing \nSocial Security that will make it worse? Sadly, he understands that \ndeficits are not healthy, but Dr. Greenspan is afraid to prescribe any \nserious medicine.\n  One of the concerns we have with the Social Security trust fund is \nafter the surplus has ended and the Bush administration's tax cuts \nbrought us into this new era of deficits, more and more money is being \npulled out of the Social Security trust fund.\n  The President, who tells us he is worried about the Social Security \ntrust fund, has been the biggest problem the Social Security trust fund \nhas run into. His tax cut plan and his privatization plan attack \nliterally the balance in the Social Security trust fund. Congress has \njoined in this.\n  Every time Congress voted for the tax cuts, it voted to raid the \nSocial Security trust fund. Since 2000, the Social Security trust fund \nsurplus has lost $800 billion--$800 billion taken out of the Social \nSecurity trust fund since the year 2000 when President Bush came to \noffice.\n  Now the President tells us he is worried about Social Security's \nfuture. The obvious question is, Why weren't you worried when you were \ntaking all of this money out of the Social Security trust fund?\n  How much of that surplus was paid back to strengthen the Social \nSecurity trust fund since President Bush took office? Zero. The \nPresident has been taking their money out of the Social Security trust \nfund. That means workers have paid $800 billion more into Social \nSecurity in taxes than were necessary to pay out benefits and the \nSocial Security trust fund turned around,\n\n[[Page S1457]]\n\nand that money was removed by the President's policies.\n  The Bush administration has borrowed $800 billion from the American \npublic over the last 5 years--money that was paid to the Government for \nthe Social Security trust fund, for their tax cuts, and to fund the \nwar. Instead of paying it back, the Republicans have called the bonds \non the Social Security trust fund ``meaningless IOUs.'' How is that for \nrespect for the Social Security trust fund.\n  Now to draw attention away from the Republican idea of cutting \nbenefits instead of paying the trust fund back, the Republican Policy \nCommittee has come up with a document criticizing a Democratic plan on \nSocial Security that doesn't exist. We talked about that earlier this \nmorning. In their document, the Republican Policy Committee says the \nDemocrats want to use the Social Security trust fund surpluses for the \nnext 13 years for new Government programs.\n\n  We have been saying for years that we need to protect the Social \nSecurity trust fund. The Democratic position was well articulated by \nPresident Clinton in 1998. In his State of the Union Address, President \nClinton said, ``What should we do with the projected budget surplus? \nSave Social Security first.''\n  That has been the Democratic position--not the Republican position.\n  President Clinton went on to say, ``I propose that we reserve 100 \npercent of the surplus--that's every penny of any surplus--until we \nhave taken all the necessary measures to strengthen the Social Security \nsystem for the 21st Century.''\n  In his campaign to succeed President Clinton, former Vice President \nGore--they kidded him about this--talked about a lockbox to protect the \ntrust fund for Social Security. But since President Bush was elected in \n2000, Democrats in Congress have been trying to preserve the Social \nSecurity trust fund. We have tried time after time to amend President \nBush's reckless tax cuts and to protect the Social Security trust fund.\n  Here is a chart which goes through the variety of votes taken on the \nfloor of the Senate since President Bush took office. Each one of these \nsix votes was an effort by the Democrats to protect the Social Security \ntrust fund from tax cuts and spending by President Bush.\n  Starting with the Bush tax cut in 2001, Senator Byrd, to forego tax \ncuts to extend Social Security, was defeated on a party-line vote--38 \nDemocrats, yes; 48 Republicans, no.\n  The Harkin amendment to delay the tax cuts until we enact legislation \nthat ensures the long-term solvency of Social Security and Medicare, \nparty-line vote, defeated; 45 Democrats voted yes, Republicans voted \nno, 49.\n  The list goes on.\n  The point is that repeatedly we have said to the Bush administration, \nif you keep taking money out of the Social Security trust fund, you are \ngoing to jeopardize the future. You have to protect it. Don't give a \ntax cut to the wealthiest people in America and endanger Social \nSecurity.\n  Six different times, the Republicans in the Senate were given a \nchance to agree with this, and six different times they prevailed and \nvoted ``no.'' Now they come before us today and argue it is the \nDemocrats who want to take money out of the Social Security trust fund.\n  Take a look at the reality of deficits under this administration. \nTake a look at the surplus, the black ink, inherited by President Bush, \nand then look at deficits that have been created. One-half of this \ndeficit was created by tax cuts, primarily to the wealthiest people in \nAmerica.\n  Now look at how this deficit will grow, if the President's \nprivatization plan on Social Security goes through.\n  Mr. Greenspan came to Capitol Hill. He had a chance to talk about \nbeing fiscally conservative. He had a chance to tell us that \nprivatizing Social Security was a bad idea because of the deficits it \ncreates for future generations. But once again, he stopped short of \nthat kind of sound advice.\n  Today, Mr. Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee the single \nbiggest tool the Government has to increase national savings is to \nreduce the deficit. We all agree with that. Unfortunately, Mr. \nGreenspan is not candid and direct when it comes to the President's \nprivatization plan for Social Security, which adds dramatically to the \ndeficit.\n  Imagine, over 20 years we are going to add $4 or $5 trillion to the \ndeficit so that President Bush can create the so-called private \naccounts. That is shortsighted. It is not going to help the country \nrecover.\n  After the President submitted a budget last week showing a dramatic \nworsening of the Nation's fiscal outlook, the President sent Congress a \nrequest for an additional $82 billion in spending for the war in Iraq. \nThe money to fund the war on terrorism, the money to fund this war in \nIraq is not included in the President's budget. President Bush's plan \nto privatize Social Security was not included, either. The $2 trillion \nthat is needed for this transition in Social Security is not there.\n  The Republican Policy Committee wants to criticize Democrats on \nSocial Security instead of answering the hard questions about the \nPresident's privatization plan. Where did the money go that Americans \npaid into Social Security? Where will the money come from to transition \nto any privatization system?\n  Instead of criticizing the so-called Democratic bill that does not \nexist, the Republicans ought to produce their bill to privatize Social \nSecurity. Once the American people understand it doesn't add up, they \nwill reject it.\n  We are going to go back to principles and values which say we should \nprotect Social Security first. That is what President Clinton said. \nThat should still be our guiding value in this debate.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I understand we are in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/16/senate-section/article/S1457-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1457-S1458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I will spend a few minutes correcting the \nrecord in response to a question of press availability on Tuesday about \nwhether Democrats were opposing as a caucus all of the renominated \njudges that previously were denied an opportunity for an up-or-down \nvote when a bipartisan majority stood ready to confirm them last year.\n  The Senate minority leader said, ``Renomination is not the key. I \nthink the question is, those judges that have already been turned down \nin the Senate''--in other words, he said these judges, even though they \ncommanded the support of a bipartisan majority of the Senate during the \nlast 2 years and were not permitted to have an up-or-down vote, he \ncharacterized those judges who have now been renominated by the \nPresident as judges who have, in fact, been turned down by the Senate.\n  So my question is, to whom is the distinguished Democratic leader \nreferring? None of President Bush's nominees have been turned down by \nthe none, zero. The nominees he referred to were denied a vote \naltogether. In fact, all of these nominees would have been confirmed \nlast Congress had majorities been allowed to govern as they have during \nthe entire history of this country and the entire history of the \nSenate--save and except for the time when Democrats chose to deny a \nmajority the opportunity for an up-or-down vote.\n\n  So I would say, correcting the record, it is a little difficult to \nturn down a nominee, as the minority leader has said, if the nominee \nnever gets an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor.\n  Now, the second part I would like to correct is that when the \nDemocratic leader was asked whether obstruction would create a 60-vote \nthreshold for all future judicial nominees, he said:\n\n       It's always been a 60-vote for judges. There is--nothing \n     change[d].\n\n  He said:\n\n       Go back many, many, many years. Go back decades and it's \n     always been that way.\n\n  Well, we took his advice, and we did go back over the years. It turns \nout it\n\n[[Page S1458]]\n\nhas not always been that way. Indeed, there has never, ever, ever been \na refusal to permit an up-or-down vote with a bipartisan majority \nstanding ready to confirm judges in the history of the Senate until \nthese last 2 years. Many nominees have, in fact, been confirmed by a \nvote of less than 60 Senators. In fact, the Senate has consistently \nconfirmed judges who enjoyed a majority but not 60-vote support, \nincluding Clinton appointees Richard Paez, William Fletcher, and Susan \nOki Mollway; and Carter appointees Abner Mikva and L.T. Senter.\n  Specifically, the distinguished Democratic leader, yesterday, when he \nsaid this had been used by Republicans against Democratic nominees, \nmentioned Judge Paez. Well, obviously, that is not correct because \nJudge Paez, indeed, was confirmed by the Senate and sits on the Federal \nbench today.\n  So it reminds me of, perhaps, an old adage I learned when I was \nyounger, when computers were not as common as they are now, and people \nmarveled at this new technology, and those who wanted to chasten us a \nlittle bit would say, well, they are not the answer to all of our \nconcerns, and they said: Garbage in, garbage out. In other words, if \nyou do not have your facts right, it is very difficult to reach a \nproper conclusion.\n  So I thought it was very interesting--and I thought it was \nimportant--that the Democratic leader would make this claim, first of \nall, as I said, that these judges had been somehow turned down by the \nSenate when, in fact, they had been denied an opportunity for an up-or-\ndown vote; and, secondly, that somehow there is a 60-vote requirement, \nand it has always been that way, because the facts demonstrate that \nboth of those conclusions are clearly incorrect.\n  Finally, he said something I do more or less agree with, although I \nwould differ a little bit on the contentious tone. He said: We're \nhopeful they'll bring them to the floor so there will be a fair fight. \nWell, I think I knew what he meant. I hope he meant a fair debate. \nFrankly, the American people are tired of obstruction and what they see \nas partisan wrangling and fighting over judicial nominees.\n  In the end, that is what happened during the Clinton administration \nwhen, perhaps, judges who were not necessarily favored by our side of \nthe aisle did receive an up-or-down vote and did get confirmed. And \nthat is, of course, what happened during the Carter administration. In \nfact, that is what has happened throughout American history--until our \nworthy adversaries on the other side of the aisle decided to obstruct \nthe President's judicial nominees and they were denied the courtesy of \nthat fair process, that fair debate, and an up-or-down vote.\n  Let me just conclude by saying this really should not be a partisan \nfight. Indeed, what we want is a fair process. We want a process that \napplies the same when a Democrat is in the White House and Democrats \nare in the majority in the Senate as we do when a Republican is in the \nWhite House and Republicans are in the majority in the Senate.\n  We want good judges. The American people deserve to have judges who \nwill strictly interpret the law and will rule without regard to some of \nthe political passions of the day. A judge understands that they are \nnot supposed to take sides in a controversy. That is what Congress, the \nso-called political branch, is for. That is why debate is so important \nin this what has been called the greatest deliberative body on Earth. \nBut we do not want judges who make political decisions. Rather, we want \njudges who will enforce those decisions because they are sworn to \nuphold the law and enforce the law as written. Members of Congress \nwrite the laws, the President signs or vetoes the laws, and judges are \nsupposed to enforce them but not participate in the rough and tumble of \npolitics.\n  So it is important that the process I have described produces a truly \nindependent judiciary because we want judges who are going to be \numpires, who are going to call balls and strikes regardless of who is \nup at bat. So I think the process we have seen over the last couple \nyears, which, unfortunately, it sounds like, if what I am hearing out \nof the Democratic leader is any indication, is a process that has not \nonly been unfair because it has denied bipartisan majorities an \nopportunity to confirm judges who have been nominated by the President, \nbut it is one which, frankly, creates too much of a political process, \none where it appears that judges who are sworn to uphold the law, and \nwho will be that impartial umpire--it has made them part of an \ninherently political process.\n\n  Now, I want to be clear. It is the Senate's obligation to ask \nquestions and to seriously undertake our obligation to perform our duty \nunder the Constitution to provide advice and consent. But, ultimately, \nit is our obligation to vote, not to obstruct, particularly when we \nhave distinguished nominees being put forward for our consideration, \nwhen they are unnecessarily besmirched and, really, tainted by a \nprocess that is beneath the dignity of the United States. Certainly \nnone of these individuals who are offering themselves for service to \nour Nation's courts in the judiciary deserve to be treated this way.\n  So, basically, Mr. President, what we are talking about is a process \nthat works exactly the same way when Democrats are in power as it does \nwhen Republicans are in power. That, indeed, is the only principled way \nwe can approach this deadlock and this obstructionism. I hope the \nDemocratic leader--who I know has a very difficult job because he, no \ndoubt, has to deal with and reflect the views of his caucus on this \nissue--I hope he will encourage his caucus, the Democrats in the \ncaucus, and we will all, as a body, look at the opportunity to perhaps \nview this as a chance for a fresh start, a chance for a fair process, \none that is more likely to produce an independent judiciary that is \ngoing to call balls and strikes regardless of who is at bat.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity.

Mr. President, before going up to the 3 o'clock \nbriefing, I heard my friend--he is a friend and colleague of mine--\nSenator Cornyn make comments about our leader, Senator Reid, accusing \nhim and Democratic Senators of obstruction in the judicial nomination \nprocess earlier today.\n  That sort of rhetoric may be good for sound bites, but it doesn't \nmatch the reality of the Senate's tradition or the Founding Fathers' \nvision in creating the checks and balances of our constitutional \nsystem.\n  In the Constitutional Convention, they considered four different \ntimes who should have the authority about naming justices. On three of \nthose four times, it was unanimous that the Senate of the United States \nwas named. The last important decision the Constitutional Convention \nmade was dividing the authority between the President and the Senate of \nthe United States. Any reading of those debates will reaffirm that.\n  With all respect to my colleague making comments about our leader, \nthe Senator from Nevada, he clearly has not read carefully that \nConstitutional Convention. It says that we have a responsibility, a \nconstitutional responsibility to exercise our will on these matters. \nHistorically, the record shows more than 98 percent of the President's \nnominees have been approved. In fairness to my friend who can speak for \nhimself and does that very well and does not need me here, as to these \nattacks on Senator Reid, it is important to understand the facts and\n\n[[Page S1459]]\n\nget them correct if we are going to have those interventions in the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FINDINGS.\n\n       [Congress makes the following findings:\n       [(1) Deciphering the sequence of the human genome and other \n     advances in genetics open major new opportunities for medical \n     progress. New knowledge about the genetic basis of illness \n     will allow for earlier detection of illnesses, often before \n     symptoms have begun. Genetic testing can allow individuals to \n     take steps to reduce the likelihood that they will contract a \n     particular disorder. New knowledge about genetics may allow \n     for the development of better therapies that are more \n     effective against disease or have fewer side effects than \n     current treatments. These advances give rise to the potential \n     misuse of genetic information to discriminate in health \n     insurance and employment.\n       [(2) The early science of genetics became the basis of \n     State laws that provided for the sterilization of persons \n     having presumed genetic ``defects'' such as mental \n     retardation, mental disease, epilepsy, blindness, and hearing \n     loss, among other conditions. The first sterilization law was \n     enacted in the State of Indiana in 1907. By 1981, a majority \n     of States adopted sterilization laws to ``correct'' apparent \n     genetic traits or tendencies. Many of these State laws have \n     since been repealed, and many have been modified to include \n     essential constitutional requirements of due process and \n     equal protection. However, the current explosion in the \n     science of genetics, and the history of sterilization laws by \n     the States based on early genetic science, compels \n     Congressional action in this area.\n       [(3) Although genes are facially neutral markers, many \n     genetic conditions and disorders are associated with \n     particular racial and ethnic groups and gender. Because some \n     genetic traits are most prevalent in particular groups, \n     members of a particular group may be stigmatized or \n     discriminated against as a result of that genetic \n     information. This form of discrimination was evident in the \n     1970s, which saw the advent of programs to screen and \n     identify carriers of sickle cell anemia, a disease which \n     afflicts African-Americans. Once again, State legislatures \n     began to enact discriminatory laws in the area, and in the \n     early 1970s began mandating genetic screening of all African \n     Americans for sickle cell anemia, leading to discrimination \n     and unnecessary fear. To alleviate some of this stigma, \n     Congress in 1972 passed the National Sickle Cell Anemia \n     Control Act, which withholds Federal funding from States \n     unless sickle cell testing is voluntary.\n       [(4) Congress has been informed of examples of genetic \n     discrimination in the workplace. These include the use of \n     pre-employment genetic screening at Lawrence Berkeley \n     Laboratory, which led to a court decision in favor of the \n     employees in that case Norman-Bloodsaw v. Lawrence Berkeley \n     Laboratory (135 F.3d 1260, 1269 (9th Cir. 1998)). Congress \n     clearly has a compelling public interest in relieving the \n     fear of discrimination and in prohibiting its actual practice \n     in employment and health insurance.\n       [(5) Federal law addressing genetic discrimination in \n     health insurance and employment is incomplete in both the \n     scope and depth of its protections. Moreover, while many \n     States have enacted some type of genetic non-discrimination \n     law, these laws vary widely with respect to their approach, \n     application, and level of protection. Congress has collected \n     substantial evidence that the American public and the medical \n     community find the existing patchwork of State and Federal \n     laws to be confusing and inadequate to protect them from \n     discrimination. Therefore Federal legislation establishing a \n     national and uniform basic standard is necessary to fully \n     protect the public from discrimination and allay their \n     concerns about the potential for discrimination, thereby \n     allowing individuals to take advantage of genetic testing, \n     technologies, research, and new therapies.\n        [TITLE I--GENETIC NONDISCRIMINATION IN HEALTH INSURANCE\n\n     [SEC. 101.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Deciphering the sequence of the human genome and other \n     advances in genetics open major new opportunities for medical \n     progress. New knowledge about the genetic basis of illness \n     will allow for earlier detection of illnesses, often before \n     symptoms have begun. Genetic testing can allow individuals to \n     take steps to reduce the likelihood that they will contract a \n     particular disorder. New knowledge about genetics may allow \n     for the development of better therapies that are more \n     effective against disease or have fewer side effects than \n     current treatments. These advances give rise to the potential \n     misuse of genetic information to discriminate in health \n     insurance and employment.\n       (2) The early science of genetics became the basis of State \n     laws that provided for the sterilization of persons having \n     presumed genetic ``defects'' such as mental retardation, \n     mental disease, epilepsy, blindness, and hearing loss, among \n     other conditions. The first sterilization law was enacted in \n     the State of Indiana in 1907. By 1981, a majority of States \n     adopted sterilization laws to ``correct'' apparent genetic \n     traits or tendencies. Many of these State laws have since \n     been repealed, and many have been modified to include \n     essential constitutional requirements of due process and \n     equal protection. However, the current explosion in the \n     science of genetics, and the history of sterilization laws by \n     the States based on early genetic science, compels \n     Congressional action in this area.\n       (3) Although genes are facially neutral markers, many \n     genetic conditions and disorders are associated with \n     particular racial and ethnic groups and gender. Because some \n     genetic traits are most prevalent in particular groups, \n     members of a particular group may be stigmatized or \n     discriminated against as a result of that genetic \n     information. This form of discrimination was evident in the \n     1970s, which saw the advent of programs to screen and \n     identify carriers of sickle cell anemia, a disease which \n     afflicts African-Americans. Once again, State legislatures \n     began to enact discriminatory laws in the area, and in the \n     early 1970s began mandating genetic screening of all African \n     Americans for sickle cell anemia, leading to discrimination \n     and unnecessary fear. To alleviate some of this stigma, \n     Congress in 1972 passed the National Sickle Cell Anemia \n     Control Act, which withholds Federal funding from States \n     unless sickle cell testing is voluntary.\n       (4) Congress has been informed of examples of genetic \n     discrimination in the workplace. These include the use of \n     pre-employment genetic screening at Lawrence Berkeley \n     Laboratory, which led to a court decision in favor of the \n     employees in that case Norman-Bloodsaw v. Lawrence Berkeley \n     Laboratory (135 F.3d 1260, 1269 (9th Cir. 1998)). Congress \n     clearly has a compelling public interest in relieving the \n     fear of discrimination and in prohibiting its actual practice \n     in employment and health insurance.\n       (5) Federal law addressing genetic discrimination in health \n     insurance and employment is incomplete in both the scope and \n     depth of its protections. Moreover, while many States have \n     enacted some type of genetic non-discrimination law, these \n     laws vary widely with respect to their approach, application, \n     and level of protection. Congress has collected substantial \n     evidence that the American public and the medical community \n     find the existing patchwork of State and Federal laws to be \n     confusing and inadequate to protect them from discrimination. \n     Therefore Federal legislation establishing a national and \n     uniform basic standard is necessary to fully protect the \n     public from discrimination and allay their concerns about the \n     potential for discrimination, thereby allowing individuals to \n     take advantage of genetic testing, technologies, research, \n     and new therapies.\n         TITLE I--GENETIC NONDISCRIMINATION IN HEALTH INSURANCE\n\n     SEC. 101.

SEVERABILITY.\n\n       If any provision of this Act, an amendment made by this \n     Act, or the application of such provision or amendment to any \n     person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional, the \n     remainder of this Act, the amendments made by this Act, and \n     the application of such provisions to any person or \n     circumstance shall not be affected thereby.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, this is a bill that has been about 5 years \nin the works. It was introduced by Senator Snowe, who was joined by \nSenators Frist, Gregg, Kennedy, myself, and others. It has been \nintroduced a number of times, but in 2003 this bill was passed by a \nvote of 95 to nothing. The only difference between that bill and the \none before you today is deletion of a provision that makes conforming \nchanges to the Internal Revenue Code to ensure that a small number of \nhealth insurance plans, known as church plans, do not discriminate on \nthe basis of genetic information.\n  We are removing the church plan provision because at the last minute \nyesterday a concern was raised that the language caused what is called \na blue slip problem, which relates to the constitutional requirement \nthat revenue measures originate in the House. There is considerable \ndisagreement as to whether the church plan provision has a revenue \nimpact and whether there is, in fact, a blue slip problem. In my \nopinion, there is no jurisdictional or constitutional problem with this \nsimple conforming amendment.\n  The Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee in the Senate \ntook great pains to draft the bill within its own jurisdiction and was \ndisappointed that these concerns were raised at this late date. In the \ninterest of moving this bill and creating the important protections \nthat it guarantees, we are removing the questioned language.\n  It is my understanding and hope that the House of Representatives \nwill address the question of church plans when it takes up genetic \ninformation nondiscrimination legislation. Certainly no one believes \nthat health insurance plans run by churches and other religious \norganizations should discriminate against individuals on the basis of \ngenetic information. I am confident that when Congress has worked its \nwill and delivered a genetic information bill to President Bush, which \nhe requested, church plans will be treated the same as employer group \nhealth plans and individual health plans.\n  I am pleased that this bill is finally here for debate and we will be \nable to take it through the process. Again, it is an important step \ntoward eliminating discrimination based on genetic information in both \nhealth insurance and employment decisions.\n  This bill was reported unanimously last week by the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee. It is identical to S. 2283 in \nthe last Congress, which passed 95 to nothing with strong \nadministration support. The purpose of this legislation is to protect \nindividuals from discrimination in health insurance and employment on \nthe basis of genetic information. It would accomplish this by \npreventing health insurers and employers from taking any action that \nwould affect an employee's health or employment benefits based on \ngenetic information an employer might discover.\n  Establishing these protections will allay concerns about the \npotential for discrimination, and it will encourage individuals to \nparticipate in genetic research and to take advantage of genetic \ntesting, new technologies, and new therapies. The legislation will \nprovide substantial protections to those individuals who may suffer \nfrom actual genetic discrimination now, or may have some reason to be \nconcerned about it in the future. These steps are essential to \nfulfilling the tremendous promise of genetic research and science.\n  The science of genetic technology has seen an explosion of progress \nin the past few years.\n  Just 2 years ago, for example, scientists at the National Institutes \nof Health and elsewhere finally completed assembly of the human genome. \nWhat had seemed impossible for so long came to pass. Suddenly, with \ngreat fanfare and the attention of the international scientific \ncommunity, the announcement was made. The human genetic code had been \nbroken.\n  Among other effects, the work of the Human Genome Project and sister \nefforts elsewhere has accelerated the ability of scientists to discover \ngenetic ``markers'' for many serious and significant diseases that we \nmay be able to avoid with the proper care and preventive treatment.\n  Unfortunately, great change such as this sometimes carries with it \nnot only great promise, but also a potential for misuse. That occurs \nwhen what should be an exciting breakthrough becomes at the same time a \nsource of fear. For example, some individuals who should have welcomed \nthe new ability to test for markers of inherited diseases instead \nencountered fear that such information might also be used to deny them \ninsurance coverage or employment security.\n  Ironically, for some, what could have been a life-saving tool became \ninstead a means to harm the very people it was designed to protect. For \ntoo many, it was simply better not to know. Allow me to recount just a \nfew real-life examples, drawn from testimony before NIH panels \ninvestigating this issue:\n  One woman, who suffers from a rare liver disorder, found that both \nshe and her children were rejected by a major insurance company, even \nthough both children were only passive carriers of the disease and \nwould never suffer from it. Only after a news organization contacted \nthe insurer was the denial reversed.\n  In another example, a woman with a family history of breast cancer \nfound that she, too, carried the genetic marker for that disease--and \nas a result chose to have a precautionary mastectomy and hysterectomy. \nAfter that, her employer received a $13,000 annual increase in his \nsmall company's health insurance bill.\n  As a result, this woman's employer asked her to switch to her \nhusband's insurance and told her that if she did so she would get a \nraise. Fearing that a switch in coverage would jeopardize her ability \nto be covered at all, she refused. The employer then raised the premium \namounts charged to all his employees.\n  These accounts, and others like them, make the point very strongly \nfor the need for us to act. Simply put, we need to act now to save \nlives.\n  We have before us today an important bill that will address the fault \nin the system and correct it. It was carefully crafted to alleviate the \nproblems faced by people like those I have mentioned. It was designed \nto calm the fears of those who are hesitant to subject themselves to \ngenetic tests, knowing that what safeguards are in place may prove to \nbe inadequate. It is a bill to restore their confidence in the system \nand their faith that the process is fair.\n  Only if we pass this legislation now will we truly be able to \nencourage the scientific progress in this field. The science of \ngenetics may well hold our best hope for combating many of our worst \nafflictions. However, genetics, like the rest of science, will progress \nbest when ideas and information are freely exchanged.\n  As a former small businessman, I am sensitive to the concerns raised \nby some in the business community that this legislation might impose \nnew liabilities on employers. I am confident, however, that after they \nbecome familiar with the provisions of this bill, such critics will see \nthat it has been carefully written such that its enactment will reduce \nthe risk that an employer will ever be dragged into court to face a \nclaim of genetic discrimination.\n  It will not do this by letting employers and insurers off the hook. \nFar from it. Rather, what this bill will do is reduce litigation \nbecause its rules are clear, the exceptions are responsible, and the \nprocedure is fair.\n  Simply put, neither will employees become victims of discrimination \nnor will employers be sued unreasonably. Why? Because this bill sets a \nstandard for conduct that is easy to understand and easy to follow. We \nare far better off setting the rules of the road clearly and ``up \nfront,'' rather than allowing them to be set piecemeal through \nlitigation.\n  We also must act now to ensure legal uniformity and consistency \nnationwide. About half the States today have laws governing genetic \ninformation. However, these laws differ significantly from one another \nand do not always fully address the problem.\n\n[[Page S1477]]\n\n  Once this legislation is signed into law we will have a clear, \nconcise and uniform policy on genetic information that will make clear \nwhat is and is not an acceptable use for genetic information.\n  Over the course of the last Congress, I had the pleasure of working \non this legislation with colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I thank \nthe majority leader and Senators Snowe, Gregg, Kennedy, Jeffords, and \nothers for their good efforts to reach a bipartisan agreement on this \nbill. It will make a difference in more lives than we will ever know.\n  If we pass this legislation, and pass it we must, we will have taken \na great step forward and ensured that the initial breakthroughs of Dr. \nWatson and Dr. Crick, and the more recent ones by the National Genome \nProject, will continue to reap benefits for generations to come.\n  We will finally have a uniform policy in place to ensure that \ninformation retrieved from genetic testing will remain confidential and \noff limits to those who would be tempted to use it to discriminate.\n  As genetic technology continues to develop in the years to come, the \nbeneficial impact on the public health and our individual lifestyles \npromises to be enormous. Enactment of the bill before us today will \nhelp America secure the realization of that promise.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first I commend my friend and chairman of \nthe Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Senator Enzi, for \nhis leadership in reporting out this legislation. As he has outlined, \nand as I will speak to in a moment, it is a matter of enormous \nimportance to millions of Americans. He has outlined the reasons for \nthat.\n  When we think back to the time Senator Snowe and others introduced \nthis legislation a number of years ago, there was a great deal of \napprehension, a great deal of concern, and a good deal of opposition to \nthis over that period of time. Due to a good deal of very hard, \ndiligent work by the chairman here, by our staffs, and by many others \non our committees, especially Senator Jeffords and Senator Gregg, \nSenator Dodd, Senator Harkin, Senator Clinton, as well as Senator \nOlympia Snowe, we are about to successfully pass this legislation in a \nvery strong bipartisan way, and they deserve great commendation at this \ntime. I hope that with very strong bipartisan support it will send a \ngood message to the House of Representatives that it is worthy to be \ndone, necessary to be done, and has the great and overwhelming support \nof the American people. I hope we will see action.\n  I also thank the majority leader for scheduling this bill and giving \nit priority. As all of us know, Bill Frist, a physician, knows the \nextraordinary potential of genetic research and its importance in \nimproving the quality of medical care and in preventing, treating, and \ncuring disease. I want to express our great appreciation to him for \ngiving us the opportunity to speak this afternoon, with the completion \nof this bill either this evening or tomorrow. We thank him as well.\n  Throughout our history, the Nation has moved toward a more fair and \nmore just society, often with great difficulty. Along the way, we had \nsetbacks, even some failures. But we have had significant triumphs, \ntoo, especially in this past half century.\n  In 1964 the Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act to end one of the \ngreat evils of our time, discrimination against millions of our fellow \ncitizens based on their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. \nIn 1965 we passed the Voting Rights Act to end discrimination in the \nright to vote.\n  In 1967, we passed another important law prohibiting age \ndiscrimination in employment.\n  In 1990, we passed the Americans with Disabilities Act to end \ndiscrimination against citizens with mental or physical handicaps.\n  In 1991, we strengthened the vital protections against job \ndiscrimination established in the 1964 Act.\n  Today we take another step in our national journey to a fairer and \nmore just America by approving important legislation to end another \ninsidious form of bias--discrimination based on the most personal \naspect of any individuals, their unique genetic code.\n  Four years ago, we celebrated an accomplishment that once seemed \nunimaginable--deciphering the entire sequence of the human DNA code. \nThis amazing accomplishment may well affect the 21st century as \nprofoundly as the invention of the computer or the splitting of the \natom affected the 20th century.\n  I personally believe this is the century of the life sciences with \nthe greatest kind of hope and opportunity for progress in the life \nscience area.\n  To cite but one example of why this legislation is so important, it \nwas this new knowledge that enabled scientists to decipher the DNA \nsequence of the SARS virus only weeks after it was first identified.\n  The extraordinary promise of science to improve health and relieve \nsuffering is in jeopardy, however, if our laws fail to provide adequate \nprotections against abuse and misuse of genetic information.\n  The bipartisan bill the Senate considers today prohibits health \ninsurers from using genetic information to deny health coverage or \nraise premiums.\n  It bars employers from using genetic information to make employment \ndecisions. It prohibits insurers and employers from seeking genetic \ninformation, or requesting or requiring individuals to take genetic \ntests. It bars disclosure of genetic information by an insurer or \nemployer, and provides effective remedies so that anyone who has \nsuffered genetic discrimination can obtain relief.\n  Congress took an initial step in the right direction when we passed \nthe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. That landmark \nlaw established important protections to ensure that those who change \ntheir job or lose their job would not also lose their health insurance. \nIt included also a prohibition on genetic discrimination in group \nhealth insurance.\n  The pending bill extends that prohibition to many other types of \ngenetic discrimination, and I commend our colleague from Maine, Senator \nSnowe, has been a principal leader on this vital issue for many years.\n  I also commend our distinguished chairman of the HELP Committee, \nSenator Enzi, for his impressive commitment to enacting this needed \nlegislation by making it one of the very first items for committee \naction under his leadership. Other members of our committee have given \ntime, energy and ideas to this important issue, especially Senator \nJeffords, Senator Gregg, Senator Dodd, and Senator Harkin.\n  Our majority leader deserves great credit as well. As a physician, he \nknows the extraordinary potential of genetic research to improve the \nquality of medical care and prevent, treat, and cure disease. \nHopefully, the bipartisan momentum will lead to an enactment of \nlegislation this year.\n  Few kinds of information are more personal or more private than a \nperson's genetic makeup. This information should not be shared by \ninsurers or employers, or be used in decisions about health coverage or \na job. It should only be used by patients and their doctors to make the \nbest possible decisions on diagnosis and treatment.\n  I hope we can all agree that discrimination on the basis of a \nperson's genetic traits is as unacceptable as discrimination on the \nbasis of race or religion. No American should be denied health \ninsurance or fired from a job because of a genetic test.\n  Last fall, witnesses on a panel of the National Institutes of Health \ntestified about their first hand accounts of genetic discrimination. \nEven though they will never develop the disease, Heidi Williams' \nchildren were denied health insurance coverage because they are \ncarriers for a genetic disorder. Phil Hardt's children feared \ndiscrimination so much that they sought genetic tests in secret, paying \nout of their own pockets and not using their real names.\n  During hearings in the House, Gary Avary told how his employer, the \nBurlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad, required any employee with \ncarpal tunnel syndrome to have a genetic test. Employees who refused \nwere threatened with penalties, or even the loss of their jobs.\n\n[[Page S1478]]\n\n  Terri Seargent was discharged from her job at a private firm in North \nCarolina in 1999, 2 months after beginning very expensive treatment for \na disease that was covered by her employer's health insurance plan. \nSince joining her employer in 1996, she had received positive annual \nperformance ratings and generous annual raises. Yet she lost her job \nsoon after the special treatment began.\n  Fear of genetic discrimination also prevents people from having \ngenetic tests for hereditary cancer, which would provide them with \nlife-saving information to help them prevent the onset of cancer or \nincrease the likelihood of early diagnosis. In a recent study, only 57 \npercent of women decided to undergo testing for mutations in the breast \ncancer genes and only 43 percent of those at risk for colon cancer \nchose to have genetic testing. People fear cancer, but many also fear \nlosing their jobs or their health insurance even more.\n  Experts in genetics are united in calling for strong protections to \nprevent this misuse and abuse of science.\n  The HHS advisory panel on genetic testing--with experts in law, \nscience, medicine and business--has recommended unambiguously that \nfederal legislation is needed to prohibit discrimination in employment \nor health insurance based on genetic information.\n  Francis Collins, the leader of the NIH project to sequence the human \ngenome, said:\n\n     Genetic information and genetic technology can be used in \n     ways that are fundamentally unjust . . . Already, people have \n     lost their jobs, lost their health insurance, and lost their \n     economic well-being because of the misuse of genetic \n     information.\n\n  Genetic tests are becoming even cheaper today and more widely \navailable. If we don't ban discrimination now, it may soon be routine \nfor employers to use genetic tests to deny jobs to employees, based on \ntheir risk for disease.\n  When Congress enacts clear protections against genetic discrimination \nin employment and health insurance, all Americans will be able to enjoy \nthe benefits of genetic research, free from the fear that their \npersonal genetic information will be used against them.\n  If Congress fails to guarantee that genetic information is used only \nfor legitimate purposes, we will squander the vast potential of genetic \nresearch to improve the nation's health.\n  Effective enforcement of the ban will also be essential. It makes no \nsense to enact legislation giving the American people the promise of \nprotection against this form of discrimination, and then deny them the \nreality of that protection.\n  President Bush recognizes the seriousness of this problem, and \nsupports a ban on genetic discrimination. As he said on June 26, 2001, \n``genetic information should be an opportunity to prevent and treat \ndisease, not an excuse for discrimination. Just as our nation addressed \ndiscrimination based on race, we must now prevent discrimination based \non genetic information.''\n  I commend the President for his support, and I look forward to \nworking with the administration to see that a strong bill on genetic \ndiscrimination is signed into law this year.\n  It is time for Congress to act, and I urge the Senate to pass this \nbipartisan bill with the broadest possible support.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the strong \nstatement of the American Academy of Pediatrics. They are concerned \nthat discrimination will deny families access to health insurance for \ntheir children.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               American Academy of Pediatrics,\n\n                         Elk Grove Village, IL, February 14, 2005.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n      Ranking Member, Committee on Health, Education, Labor and \n         Pensions, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: The American Academy of Pediatrics, \n     an organization of 60,000 primary care pediatricians, \n     pediatric medical subspecialists and pediatric surgical \n     specialists dedicated to the health and well being of all \n     infants, children, adolescents, and young adults, would like \n     to express its strong support for S. 306, the Genetic \n     Information Nondiscrimination Act.\n       The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly supports \n     efforts to enhance, improve and expand the ability to provide \n     newborn screening, counseling and health care services. \n     Advances in genetic research promise great strides in the \n     diagnosis and treatment of many childhood diseases, detected \n     as early as the newborn period or later in childhood. With \n     early identification and timely intervention, we have the \n     ability to significantly reduce morbidity, mortality and \n     associated disabilities in infants and children affected with \n     certain genetic, metabolic and infectious conditions.\n       With these opportunities, however, we also have a \n     responsibility to ensure that careful consideration is given \n     to the testing and screening of children so that emerging \n     technologies are used in ways that promote the best interest \n     of patients and their families. Potential benefits of genetic \n     screening and testing are limited by the risks of harm that \n     may be done by gaining certain genetic information, including \n     potential for discrimination by insurers and employers. \n     Furthermore, the American Academy of Pediatrics is concerned \n     that genetic discrimination is a barrier for families to \n     access health insurance for their children. More than 9 \n     million children are currently uninsured in this country, and \n     millions more are underinsured. We will never achieve our \n     goal of ensuring that every child has health insurance \n     coverage if genetic discrimination is permitted.\n       For these reasons, the American Academy of Pediatrics \n     supports passage of S. 306, which would protect children and \n     families from genetic discrimination in health insurance and \n     employment. The American Academy of Pediatrics commends you \n     for your timely action on this legislation, and looks forward \n     to working with you toward its passage into law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Carol Berkowitz, M.D.,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the American Cancer Society supports our \nlegislation. The American Osteopathic Association says access to health \ncare should not be restricted on the basis of genetic testing. The \nAmerican Society for Human Genetics; the biotechnology industry--all \nhave made very important statements in support of this legislation, \nalong with other organizations.\n  We suggest, for those who are following this debate, to refer to a \nJuly 2004 report titled ``Faces of Genetic Discrimination'' from the \nCoalition for Genetic Fairness. This is a wonderful document that I \nthink has so much information. It lists the wide range of groups \nsupporting this legislation, including the American Academy of \nPediatrics, the American Cancer Society, the American Medical \nAssociation, the American Osteopathic Association, the American Society \nfor Human Genetics, the Biotechnology Industry Organization, Hadassah, \nthe Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, the National Organizations \nof Rare Disorders, the National Workrights Institute, and the Society \nfor Women's Health Research. It is a wonderful document that outlines \nthe history and the opportunity of genetic research and technology.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Maine, Ms. Snowe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank, first and foremost, the chairman \nof the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, the HELP \nCommittee, Senator Enzi, for his commitment and for moving this \nlegislation out of the committee as the first of a group of health-\nrelated bills to be referred out of his committee as the new leader, \nthe chair of this committee this year. I thank the chairman for doing \nso and I express my gratitude to him. This sends a very significant \nmessage to the House of Representatives of the importance and the value \nof this initiative. Senator Enzi not only as chair of this committee \nbut previously was instrumental for participating in negotiations for \nmore than 16 months to help fashion a consensus on the legislation now \nbefore the Senate and that was enacted through his committee, as well. \nI thank him for his leadership that made it possible to bring this \nlegislation to the Senate.\n  I also express my appreciation to my colleague on the other side of \nthe aisle, Senator Kennedy, as ranking member of the HELP Committee, \nwho has been a longtime champion of protection for an individual's \nprivate health information, dedicating himself over the past year and a \nhalf toward forging a bipartisan solution to this issue.\n  Also, as a result of the considerable yeoman efforts of the Senate \nmajority leader, a major breakthrough occurred on this legislative \ninitiative. The Senate majority leader agreed to the necessity of this \nlegislation the last few years in making it possible. It was due in \nlarge measure to his stalwart efforts in working with me and others \nsuch as\n\n[[Page S1479]]\n\nSenator Enzi and Senator Kennedy, and Senator Jeffords, who has been a \ncollaborator on this issue for 8 years, which made it possible to forge \nthis bipartisan effort. I thank the Senate majority leader because he, \nobviously, was pivotal in ensuring we could pave the way for the \npassage of this legislation as we did last fall in October with \nunanimous support. Hopefully, we will receive the same support for this \ninitiative today, as well. I thank the leader for giving his support \nand vital efforts to making this possible. I thank him for his vision \nand tireless support.\n  Also, I thank Senator Gregg who last year dedicated significant time \nand staff resources when he was the previous chair of the committee and \nfor helping to make it a priority of his committee last year when he \nchaired the HELP Committee.\n  Also, Senator Dodd has been deeply committed to fighting to ensure \nthat consumers have the strongest possible protections afforded to them \nwith the passage of this legislation.\n  Since April of 1996 when I first introduced the Genetic Information \nNondiscrimination Health Insurance Act, along with my colleague, \nSenator Jeffords, science has continued to hurtle forward, further \nopening the door to early detection and medical intervention through \nthe discovery and identification of specific genes linked to diseases \nsuch as breast cancer, Huntington's disease, glaucoma, colon cancer, \nand cystic fibrosis.\n  We recognized in 1996 with progress in the field of genetics \naccelerating at a breathtaking pace that we must ensure the fast \narriving scientific advances in treatment and prevention of diseases do \nnot advance a new basis for discrimination. As with countless \nscientific breakthroughs in history, the eventual completion of the \ngenome project not only brought the prospects of medical advances such \nas improved detection and earlier intervention but also the potential \nfor harm and abuse.\n\n  Every day since that breakthrough, the American people have been \nvulnerable to this type of discrimination. The everyday risk of \ndiscrimination has inhibited the full use of this vast, still untapped \nreservoir of knowledge.\n  As I have said previously, the fear of repercussions from one's \ngenetic makeup was brought home to me through the real-life experience \nof one of my constituents, Bonnie Lee Tucker. In 1997, Bonnie Lee wrote \nto me and told me she was too afraid to have the BRCA test for breast \ncancer, even though nine women in her immediate family were diagnosed \nwith breast cancer and she herself was a survivor. She was worried that \nknowledge might damage her daughter's ability to obtain insurance in \nthe future.\n  Bonnie Lee was not alone in her fear. When the National Institutes of \nHealth offered women genetic testing, nearly 32 percent of those who \nwere offered a test for breast cancer risk declined to take it, citing \nconcerns about health insurance discrimination.\n  What value is scientific progress if it cannot be applied to those \nwho would most benefit?\n  I recall the testimony before Congress of Dr. Francis Collins, the \nDirector of the National Human Genome Research Institute, without whom \nwe would not have reached this day. In speaking of the next step for \nthose involved in the genome project, he explained the project \nscientists were engaged in a major endeavor to ``uncover the \nconnections between particular genes and particular diseases,'' to \napply the knowledge they just unlocked. In order to accomplish this, he \nsaid:\n\n       We need a vigorous research enterprise with the involvement \n     of large numbers of individuals, so that we can draw more \n     precise connections between a particular spelling of a gene \n     and a particular outcome.\n\n  With all this tremendous potential, this effort cannot reach its full \npromise if patients have a reason to feel repercussions of genetic test \nresults. Given the advances in science, there are two distinct concerns \nat hand. The first, of course, is discrimination by health insurance. \nThe second is employment discrimination based simply upon an \nindividual's genetic information. This legislation addresses both of \nthese issues based on the firm foundation of current law.\n  With regard to health insurance, these are clear and familiar issues \nwhich the Senate has previously debated in the context of larger \npatient privacy issues. Indeed, as Congress considered what now is \nknown as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of \n1996, we also addressed medical information privacy. Moreover, any \nlegislation that seeks to fully address these issues must consider the \ninteraction of the new protections with the privacy rule which was \nmandated by HIPAA and our legislation which accomplishes just that.\n  Specifically, we clarify the protections of genetic information as \nwell as the request to receive a genetic test from being used by the \ninsurer against the patient. The fact is, genetic information only \ndetects the potential for genetically linked disease or disorder. And \npotential does not equal a diagnosis of disease.\n  It is critical this information be available to health care \nprofessionals to diagnosis or treat an illness. Without the protection \nwhich this bill offers, patients will not be able to take advantage of \nour ever-increasing knowledge of genetics.\n  On the subject of employment discrimination, unlike our legislative \nhistory in debating health privacy matters, the issue surrounding \nprotecting genetic information from workplace discrimination is not as \nextensive.\n  To that end, our bipartisan bill institutes these protections in the \nworkplace. There should be no question of this necessity. Indeed, it is \nan imperative. The threat of employment discrimination is not \nhypothetical, and therefore it is essential that we take this \ninformation off the table, so to speak, before such abuse becomes \nwidespread. While Congress has not yet debated this specific type of \nemployment discrimination, we have considerable case law and \nlegislative history on which to build.\n  Indeed, as we considered the necessity for this type of protection, \nwe agreed that we must extend current discrimination protections to \ngenetic information. We reviewed current employment discrimination law \nand possible remedies for instances of genetic discrimination and \nwhether they should differ from existing remedies under current law, \nsuch as the American Disabilities Act or the EEOC. This bill creates \nnew protections by paralleling current law and clarifying the remedies \navailable to victims of discrimination. So regardless of their \nreligion, race, or DNA, people will all receive the same protections \nunder the law. There will be an across-the-board Federal standard which \nbecomes so critical to fundamental protections under the law.\n  It has been more than 4 years since the completion of the working \ndraft of the human genome. Like a book that sits unopened, the wonders \nof the human genome are useless if it is compromised by the fear of \ndiscrimination. This legislation is a shining example of what can be \naccomplished when we set aside partisan differences in order to address \nthe challenges facing the American people.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Again, I thank the \nchair of the committee for his instrumental and pivotal leadership to \nbring this legislation to the floor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine for her \npersistence, her enthusiasm, her perseverance, and particularly her \nreasonableness in dealing with this issue, recognizing how important it \nis and how important it is to get it done now.\n  I say to the Senator, you have just done tremendous work at pulling \neverybody together. I recognize that effort. Without your efforts, this \nwould not have been possible. So I thank you for bringing it to this \npoint.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  I had mentioned earlier the great leadership that the Senator from \nMaine has been providing. She has been a noble soul since the very cold \nwinter when she first introduced this legislation. Now she deserves \ngreat credit that we are at point.\n  Just on that point, I wish to recognize Representative Slaughter in \nthe House of Representatives. She has been a great advocate over a long \nperiod of\n\n[[Page S1480]]\n\ntime. I want the Senate Record to reflect that.\n  I also want the Record to reflect the fact that President Clinton \nissued an Executive order banning genetic discrimination against \nFederal employees in the year 2000. It was limited, obviously, with his \nauthority and power, to just Federal employees but, nonetheless, it was \na significant step at that time.\n  I also draw attention to the strong support President Bush has given \nto this undertaking. In a radio broadcast, actually in 2001, he stated:\n\n       Genetic discrimination is unfair to workers and their \n     families.\n\n  In that same radio broadcast he also stated:\n\n       To deny employment or insurance to a healthy person based \n     only on predisposition violates our country's belief in equal \n     treatment and individual merit.\n\n  We also have the strong letter of support from the Secretary of HHS, \nTommy Thompson, from last year. There is also the statement from the \nadministration, this year, in support.\n  I just mention one final point. Out at the National Institutes of \nHealth, where they really do the best of the research--it is really the \ngold standard of research--they have important genetic research out \nthere. In their information sheet, they have what we call the consent \nform. This is the consent form that any individual who wants to \nparticipate in genetic research at NIH signs. It says:\n\n       We will not release any information about you or your \n     family to your insurance company or employer without your \n     permission. However, instances are known in which genetic \n     information has been obtained through legal means by third \n     parties. This may affect you or your family's ability to get \n     health insurance and/or a job.\n\n  Here is the premier workplace in the world doing the most \nsignificant, important research in genetics, which is so incredibly \nimportant, just raising this as a very real potential danger. It will \nnot be a danger when we get this legislation passed into law.\n  Finally, I also commend my friend, and our former leader, Senator \nDaschle, who had introduced important legislation in 1997 on this very \nsubject matter. He was one of the early leaders in this battle.\n  Mr. President, I think we have speakers who are on their way. I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I yield 3 minutes for purposes of a \ncolloquy with my friend, the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I thank Senator Enzi and all those who \nhave worked hard on this bill. I have a few questions in terms of my \nconcern about prenatal testing.\n  Do I understand from the remarks of the Senator from Wyoming that \nthis legislation is directed against a wide range of cases with which \nindividuals of families may be discriminated against in health \ninsurance coverage based on the results of genetic tests conducted on \nany family member?\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes, that is correct.\n  Mr. COBURN. One example of such discrimination cited in the past is \nbased on prenatal testing. A 1996 report by the National Academy of \nSciences cited a case in which a California HMO threatened to deny \nhealth care coverage to a child because that child, before being born, \nantenatal, tested positive for a genetic defect associated with cystic \nfibrosis. Would this legislation protect against this type of \ndiscrimination?\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, yes. In the type of situation described, \nthe legislation would prohibit the insurer from discriminating against \nboth the mother and the child because of the result of the genetic test \nof the child. It is the intent of the legislation to prohibit insurers \nfrom denying coverage to either a child or the child's family members \nbased on the results of prenatal testing.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Senator. Based on that interpretation and my \nunderstanding that the Senator will ensure the conference report \nincludes language that makes clear that a dependent child will be \nprotected from discrimination under this legislation regardless of when \nthe genetic information was acquired, including any information gained \nfrom ante- and prenatal testing, I will support the bill. I \ncongratulate Senator Enzi and thank him for his hard work and for the \ncolloquy.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his \ncareful concern and the depth with which he has been into the bill and \nthe vast knowledge he has as a doctor which helps to get all those \ndifferent perspectives that bring bills together. We thank him for his \nefforts.\n  I yield myself 6 minutes.\n  Answering the question of ``why do this bill now'' is very important. \nThe most persistent question from the business community about this \nbill, and the most reasonable, is why now? Why should we create a new \nbasis for lawsuits for a subject area where there is no record of \nabuse, on information that employers do not want or need, to prevent \nfear over hypothetical situations? Let me address this critical \nquestion head on because I asked it myself at the onset, and I have \nanswered it to my satisfaction.\n  First, we are not legislating in the area of the unknown but in the \narea of hope. Genetic information holds the key to better diagnosis, \nbetter cures, better lives for all of the world's population. We have \ndetermined that a serious impediment to this progress is fear, fear \nthat the information derived from the genetic tests will be used to \nharm the individual, fear that the usage of the information is creating \nreluctance and that it is leading to refusal to take tests. Every \nrefused test is progress delayed for all mankind because it is only \nthrough testing that scientists will amass the knowledge to find the \ndiagnostic tools and cures we so desperately desire. Considering the \npotential for discovery and the employer protections we have built into \nthis legislation, I am confident we have struck the right balance. But \nthe question remains, why now? Why not wait for greater proof of fear \nand abuse?\n  There are several reasons. For well over half the States, it is not \ntoo early to take action. We are seeing developed a hodgepodge of State \nlaws that address the handling of genetic information and the banning \nof its use in the workplace and in insurance. There are patterns to \nthese laws, but there are enormous inconsistencies. Likewise, Federal \nlaw is inconsistent. The Americans with Disabilities Act covers genetic \nmatters if they are ``regarded as'' a disability, but the determination \nis subjective and likely to evolve on a case-by-case basis. The Civil \nRights Acts of 1964, as amended in 1991, are also implicated.\n  In short, many questions remain over what is and what is not covered \nby existing Federal and State law. And history has taught us that \nunanswered questions breed lawsuits. With this legislation, we seek to \nanswer questions and prevent litigation. We have the opportunity to \nwrite a clearly defined set of rules for the collection and \npreservation of genetic information and carefully proscribe its usage. \nThat will prevent mistakes and abuse. Before anyone develops the desire \nor reason to harm our fellow citizens, a clear-cut set of rules \nestablished at the infancy of this amazing field of science will do \ngreater good for businesses and insurers and the public than waiting \nfor common law to develop.\n  I remind my colleagues and my friends in the private sector that \nlawyers are already looking for opportunities to sue for genetic \ndiscrimination under State laws, under the Americans With Disabilities \nAct, and under many other laws written for other purposes--hoping to \ncash in on this developing area of the law. This is one area where it \nis not appropriate to let nature take its course. I am not willing to \nabdicate this policymaking function and wait for the courts to decide \non how laws should apply to a field of science that didn't exist when \nthe laws we are talking about were written. That is the job of \nCongress.\n  It is also important to observe that there are few victims as of yet \nin this field of science and law, and that is a good thing. We want to \nkeep it that way. The rules established in the Genetic Information \nNondiscrimination\n\n[[Page S1481]]\n\nAct are clear and fair. We distinguish between the legitimate and \nillegitimate use of genetic information in the workplace. We ensure \nconfidentiality and make it clear how employers are to do that. And \nfrom my perspective, most importantly, we have included every essential \nsafeguard and exception to prevent this law from becoming a litigation \nnightmare for businesses.\n  In conclusion, let me state that it is no coincidence that the first \nmajor civil rights bill of this new Congress deals with a truly 21st \ncentury issue. While genetic discrimination may not be widespread at \nthis time, this legislation ensures that discriminatory practices will \nnever become common practice.\n  From the past, we have learned from employees, employers, insurers, \nand others all work best together when the rules are clear and \nopportunities for personal achievement and health are available. This \nlegislation tells everyone what is expected of them and avoids the trip \nwires and uncertainty of some of our existing laws.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time. I suggest the absence of a quorum \nand ask unanimous consent that the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I have here a copy of the Genetic \nInformation Nondiscrimination Act 2003, which was submitted by Senator \nGregg, who was chairman at that time. We did not do a new report this \ntime. The reason we did not is because the bill has not changed between \nthen and now.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to consult this report, Senate \nCommittee Report 108-122, not only because of its excellent background \nand analysis, but also because it clearly illustrates much of the \nthinking and work behind why this bill was drafted as it was.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a Statement of \nAdministration Policy, issued today, regarding genetic information be \nprinted in the Record. The administration favors enactment of the \nstatement this legislation and this statement gives some explanation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                Washington, DC, February 16, 2005.\n\n    Statement of Administration Policy, S. 306--Genetic Information \n                     Nondiscrimination Act of 2005\n\n       The administration favors enactment of legislation to \n     prohibit the improper use of genetic information in health \n     insurance and employment. The administration supports Senate \n     passage of S. 306 as reported, which would prohibit group \n     health plans and health insurers from denying coverage to a \n     healthy individual or charging that person higher premiums \n     based solely on a genetic predisposition to developing a \n     disease in the future. The legislation also would bar \n     employers from using individuals' genetic information when \n     making hiring, firing, job placement, or promotion decisions.\n       The mapping of the human genome has led to more information \n     about diseases and a better understanding of our genetic \n     code. Scientists are pursuing new diagnostics, treatments, \n     and cures based on this information, but the potential misuse \n     of this information raises serious moral and legal issues. \n     Concern about unwarranted use of genetic information \n     threatens access to utilization of existing genetic tests as \n     well as the ability to conduct further research. The \n     administration wants to work with Congress to make genetic \n     discrimination illegal and provide individuals with fair, \n     reasonable protections against improper use of their genetic \n     information.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield the floor, reserve the remainder of \nthe time, and suggest the absence of a quorum, and ask that the time be \nequally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, first I rise to congratulate the Senator \nfrom Wyoming for assuming the chairmanship of the HELP Committee and \nmoving forward on this exceptionally important piece of information, \nthe Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2005. Quickly moving \nthis legislation forward shows the priority the Senator from Wyoming \nplaces on straightening out our medical situation in this country, \nmaking delivery of health care more affordable, more thoughtful, and in \nthis case free of discrimination.\n  This is the first civil rights act, really, of this century, for all \nintents and purposes. It is a major commitment to people of our country \nthat they will not be discriminated against on the basis of their \ngenetic code. Last year we celebrated the discovery by Dr. Watson and \nDr. Crick of the double helix. Then we also celebrated the fact that \nNIH had mapped the human genome, that the DNA project was completed. \nThose were huge milestones which have had an exceptional impact on the \nquality of health care in this country. They will continue to have an \nexpanding impact; the breadth and depth of influence on how we deliver \nhealth care and how people's health care is affected within our Nation \ncannot even be predicted. That is because, if you can define what your \ngenetic code is, you can obviously make huge strides toward curing \ndiseases which might potentially afflict anyone.\n  But this new science also created issues for us, public policy \nissues. One of the big public policy issues it created is the issue of \ndiscrimination based on your genetic code. Everybody has this problem--\nor has this benefit--or has this situation. We all have genes. This is \na universal issue. It is something that impacts everyone.\n  So Congress has taken a long and indepth look at how we should \naddress this from a public health policy standpoint, working in a very \nbipartisan way under the leadership of Senator Enzi. Prior to that, I \nwas chairman of this committee and we worked on this very aggressively \nwith help across the aisle, of course, of Senator Kennedy and members \nof the Democratic leadership on the committee.\n  Then, outside the committee itself, Senator Frist and Senator Snowe \nand others have played a major role in making sure that what we did in \nthis area was thoughtful and had a purpose and accomplished the goal. \nThe goal was to make sure that discrimination did not occur in the \nscience of the human genome and that the science of the use of this \ninformation that genetics was going to produce could be best \nimplemented so we didn't end up retarding the development and \nimplementation of new cures. The goal was to address the concerns of \npeople relative to their genetic history and the potential it has for \nthem as they move forward in their lives so they are not impacted \nnegatively by acts of discrimination which might chill people's \nwillingness to use this genetic information or even obtain this genetic \ninformation in their interfacing with the health community.\n  This act is an effort, after a tremendous amount of work, to \nthoughtfully and intelligently address the issue of how we effectively \npromote the use of genetic information. It actually encouraged people \nto take advantage of this new science rather than have an atmosphere \nwhere people are limited or are discouraged from taking advantage of \nthis new science.\n  We know, unfortunately, that the potential is there, and it has \nactually occurred. We have instances--a few, I admit, but there are \nspecific instances--of discrimination occurring as a result of the \nperson's genetic history or potential genetic history in the area of \nemployment and in the area of health insurance. This is where this bill \naddresses those concerns.\n  It specifically addresses the issue of health insurance underwriting, \nand it specifically addresses the issue of employment. Its impact is \nthat health insurance plans will not be able to deny eligibility for an \nemployee into a health plan based on genetic information, and it \nprohibits health insurance\n\n[[Page S1482]]\n\nplans from charging higher premiums based on an individual's, or his or \nher family's, genetic information. It is very important.\n  It also does not allow an individual health insurance employer to \nrequest genetic information or to use a person's genetic information in \ntheir decisions on the hiring and firing of an individual.\n  It recognizes that all individuals, whether they are healthy or sick, \nand all medical information, whether genetic or otherwise, should be \nafforded the same protection under the law. And that is a critical \npoint.\n  The practical implication of it is, if you have a family history \nwhere you sense or may think there may be a problem that you have \nbecause of your genetic makeup and you are not going forward and being \ntested, your willingness to see a doctor to see if that genetic problem \nmay actually exist for you is not going to be limited because you are \nnot going to be concerned with the fact, if that information comes \nforward or is obtained that it might be used to limit your ability to \nget a job, keep a job, or get health insurance, or keep health \ninsurance, or, alternatively, that your children or children's children \nmight also, if the genetic information is confirmed, be subject to \ndiscrimination for work or for obtaining insurance.\n  It will allow people to be much more aggressive in using this brand \nnew science to assist them in getting their health in order and making \nsure that people and their children are properly screened for what can \nbe produced from genetic information.\n  This is going to be such a hugely valuable tool for our society and \nfor people. There should be nothing in our society which says to people \nyou really can't afford to do this, because if you take this type of \ntest, you see this doctor, if you have this type of review, you are \ngoing to find out something that might lead to your quality of life \nbeing dramatically reduced because you lose your job or you lose your \ninsurance.\n  The legislation is appropriate. Those who questions its need, do so \nout of legitimate concern that it is a new Government law, new Federal \nlegislation, and they do not see that the problem exists, I guess, in \nmany instances or, if it does exist, they don't think it is significant \nenough to address. To those folks, I would simply say this: Yes, the \nproblem does exist. Yes, we have instances of discrimination occurring \nboth in the workplace and in the insurance industry. They have been \nlimited but, more importantly than that, this is a science which holds \nsuch tremendous potential for dramatically improving the way we deliver \nhealth care as a society that we do not want anything to stand in its \nway to chill its use or to undermine the willingness of Americans to \nparticipate in studies of themselves or their families or their \ngenealogy which might undermine the advantage which this new science \ngives them in getting better health care.\n  It is an appropriate piece of legislation. I think it puts the \nemphasis in the right place, which is reasoned and appropriate in how \nwe handle genetic information and we avoid discrimination in the use of \nthat information.\n  Again, I congratulate Senator Enzi for setting this out as the first \nitem he has moved out of the HELP Committee under his chairmanship. It \nreflects his commitment to making sure health care in this country is \nnot only of a better quality, but that the science that backs up health \ncare continues to be robust as it pursues cures for all Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank and congratulate the Senator from \nNew Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, for his efforts on this bill. He was actually \nthe committee chairman who made sure that all the parties came \ntogether, which around here is no small task, and came up with this \npackage that does what our purpose was. He did it with such diligence, \ncare, and completeness.\n  Rather than take the time to put out a new committee book about the \nbill, we used his book. It gives an explanation, and it also shows that \nthe bill didn't need to be changed from what he had. So it is actually \nSenator Gregg's efforts that brought this bill to the floor and brought \nit in this complete fashion and moved it along so quickly. We thank him \nfor all of his information and help.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we are now considering a bill that I am \npleased to have cosponsored and which I worked on with my colleagues \nfor a number of years, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of \n2005.\n  I thank our chairman, Senator Enzi, for expeditiously bringing this \nto the floor and guiding it, hopefully, to early passage tomorrow.\n  I also compliment Senator Snowe on being the chief sponsor of this \nbill, and for being in the forefront of this fight to protect people \nwho want to understand perhaps the predispositions they might have for \nany illnesses because of their genetic history.\n  As we know, the bill makes it illegal for an employer or health \ninsurer to discriminate against an individual based on genetic \ninformation.\n  The good news is that advances in genetics have opened major \nopportunities for medical programs. We are now able to diagnose and \ntreat diseases earlier and more efficiently than ever before.\n  Again, my deepest thanks to Francis Collins for his great leadership \nat the National Human Genome Institute, for guiding and directing the \nmapping and the sequencing of the human gene. He has provided great \nleadership. I have followed it since Dr. Collins first took over, I \nthink back in 1993, if I am not mistaken. It has just been amazing to \nwatch this happen.\n  Some people said it was going to take 15 to 20 years to get this \ndone, but thanks to Dr. Collins and his leadership and the great staff \nthat he assembled at the National Human Genome Institute, we completed \nthe entire mapping and sequencing by April of 2003.\n  We have this great information. You can go right on the Internet and \nyou can find it all right there. It is all out there for the entire \nworld to use. Quite frankly, they are using this genetic information on \nthe human gene to understand and to do more research into the \nbackground of many of our illnesses that have genetic markers for them.\n  As a result, we are now able to diagnose and treat diseases earlier \nand more efficiently than ever before. I can daresay that in the years \nto come we are going to have more and more breakthroughs by scientists \nwho are using this toolbox--as I have often called it--of genetic \ninformation that we have derived from the mapping and sequencing of the \nhuman genome.\n  That is the good news. The bad news is that this same genetic \ninformation could be used by employers or insurance companies to \ndiscriminate in hiring or in insurance decisions. Health insurers could \ncharge higher copayments or deny coverage altogether to individuals who \nhave a genetic predisposition for certain diseases.\n  When we passed the Americans With Disabilities Act in 1990, we had \nlittle understanding of the range of genetic information that could be \nused by employers and health insurers to discriminate.\n  The problem is that the ADA does not expressly address genetic \ndiscrimination. What is more, the Supreme Court has made it more \ndifficult to apply the ADA to discrimination based on the genetic \ninformation.\n  I think there have been mistaken decisions of the Supreme Court, but, \nnonetheless, they have spoken.\n  It is incumbent upon us to pass legislation to clarify this. That is \nwhat this bill is all about--prohibiting enrollment restrictions and \npremium adjustments based on an insurer's ability to determine \nsomeone's genetic makeup. The bill prohibits employers from \ndiscriminating and hiring discrimination.\n  We want people to access the diagnostic tools scientists and \nresearchers have and will come up with in the future so they can take \nsteps to protect themselves to prevent perhaps the onset of an illness \nthat can be caused by a genetic predisposition. For example, there \ncould be a genetic marker, as we know, for breast cancer. Both of my \nsisters passed away from breast cancer at too early an age. They had \nfamilies and their children are grown up; now they have children who \nare growing up. Of course, there is a great concern among them about \nthe genetic background of their mother, or grandmother in this case. \nThey should, if they want to, be able to access information to better \nprotect themselves. They should know if they get early screening, early \nmammograms, and\n\n[[Page S1483]]\n\nwhether they might want to control their diet so they would be more \nacutely aware the earlier they detected this, if, God forbid, it should \nhappen to one of them, that they would be able to address that and to \nlive full and meaningful lives.\n  We know if breast cancer is addressed early, the chances of someone \nsurviving and living a whole, full life is great. So many people do not \ndetect it early is the problem. We want people to access the diagnostic \ntools and not be afraid that if they get this information, they might \nlose their job, their health care premiums would go up, that sort of \nthing. That is what this bill is about.\n  I thank my colleague and my friend from Wyoming, the chairman of our \ncommittee, for bringing this expeditiously to the Senate floor. \nHopefully, the House will take steps also to pass it very soon, and we \ncan send it to the President. It is incumbent upon the House to take \nprompt action and get it to the President's desk as soon as possible.\n\n\n                                Wellness\n\n  While I am here, I diverge a little bit, but not a lot, to briefly \nmention an issue that does not relate directly to the provisions of the \nbill but does relate to the issue of prevention and the issue of health \nand how much money we are spending in this country. I will talk about \nthe issue of wellness and the role that Government can play in \npromoting wellness and prevention in order to help address a crisis in \nour health care system, the crisis of exploding costs.\n  As the Senate takes important bipartisan steps forward to prohibit \ndiscrimination based on genetic information, as we are doing here \ntoday, we can and must take bipartisan steps forward to promote \nwellness. We have heard a lot recently about the projected shortfall in \nSocial Security over the next 75 years of $3.7 trillion. That is a lot \nof money in anyone's book. That is over the next 75 years. That pales \ncompared to the shortfall in Medicare, which is estimated to be $17 \ntrillion. That is the real crisis. Social Security is not a crisis; the \nreal crisis is Medicare.\n  It is not only the Federal budget that is being eaten alive, it is \nState budgets, family budgets, it is corporate budgets. Look at the \nnumbers: Some 75 percent of health care costs in the United States are \naccounted for by chronic conditions and diseases, many of which are \npreventable. Last year, nationally, we spent more than $100 billion on \nobesity alone. Medicare and Medicaid picked up almost half that tab. \nThere was an address the other day by the chairman of General Motors \ntalking about what it is doing to their company: $1,500 of the cost of \nevery car they produce is now because of health care insurance costs.\n\n  It is unwise uneconomic and totally unsustainable. If we are going to \ncontrol Medicare and Medicaid costs and private sector health care \ncosts as well, we need a significant, even a radical change of course \nin our country. We need a fundamental paradigm shift away from a sick \ncare system. That is what we have now. In other words, if you get sick, \nyou get care, but there is precious little out there now that \nencourages and gives incentives to stay healthy in the first place. We \nneed a paradigm shift toward preventing disease, promoting good \nnutrition, encouraging fitness and wellness. This will be good for the \nphysical health of the American people, and it will be good for the \nfiscal health of government, corporations, private businesses, and \nfamily budgets.\n  I believe strongly in personal responsibility. I believe people \nshould take charge of their own health. I also believe in corporate \nresponsibility, community responsibility, and government \nresponsibility. I make no bones about it: It is past time for the \nFederal Government to step to the plate in a very robust way.\n  To that end, I introduced the HELP America Act last year, otherwise \nknown as the Healthier Lifestyle and Prevention Act. This legislation \ntakes a comprehensive approach to wellness and prevention. It provides \ntools and incentives to schools, employers, and communities. It aims to \ncreate better nutrition, physical activity, and mental health \nopportunities for kids in schools. I saw some data recently that said \nthat 80 percent of elementary school kids in America today get less \nthan 1 hour of physical exercise a week in school. That is \nunconscionable. We have to have better physical activity and nutrition \nfor our kids in school.\n  The bill creates better nutrition, physical activity, and mental \nhealth opportunities for kids in school. It gives the Federal Trade \nCommission authority to regulate unfair marketing to children, \nespecially junk food. It provides incentives to build paths, safe \nsidewalks and bike paths. It requires nutrition labeling on menus in \nchain restaurants. It does a lot more than that.\n  The HELP America Act is comprehensive. It is ambitious. But it is \nonly at the beginning of a long legislative process. I am confident \nover time we can build a bipartisan consensus to move the Federal \nGovernment toward wellness, prevention, away from sickness, more in \nkeeping people healthy. We have already made some progress.\n  Several elements of the HELP America Act passed late last year. For \nexample, we secured $440 million for research at the National \nInstitutes of Health into the causes and cures of obesity. We sent more \nthan $50 million in grants to States to fund programs to address \nnutrition, physical activity, and obesity. We secured some $114 million \nfor tobacco prevention and cessation activities at the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention. We also expanded the fresh fruit and \nvegetable program.\n  Three years ago when we passed the farm bill, I put a provision in \nthere to test a theory. My theory was if we gave kids in school free \nfresh fruits and vegetables--not just at lunch but anytime during the \nday--they would eat them, they would like them, they would not be \nputting money in the vending machine to buy junk food, they would study \nbetter, they would be better behaved, and everyone would benefit. So we \ntried out the theory. We got a small amount of money in the farm bill. \nWe took 4 States, 25 schools in each State, 100 schools, and 1 Indian \nreservation in Arizona. We provided enough money to bring free fresh \nfruits and vegetables into these schools. What has happened? In each \none of those schools, it has been a resounding success. Not one of \nthose schools has asked to be taken off the program. In fact, every \nsingle one of them has asked, please, don't take this away.\n  We have now gone from four States to nine States. We have gone from \n100 schools to a little over 200 schools. It is growing. Visit one of \nthese schools where these kids get the free fresh fruits and \nvegetables.\n  These little kids in school, at about 9:30 in the morning, get the \n``growlies,'' they get a little antsy. If they have an apple to eat or \nan orange or a clementine or kiwi fruit or a banana or grapes, or they \nget fresh broccoli in the afternoon or cauliflower or carrot sticks, \nyou would be amazed how much they eat of these fruits and vegetables.\n  As I said, the teachers love it. The principals find it is a great \nsystem. Even parents now are weighing in. Parents love it. Kids are \neven going home and asking their parents to buy these at grocery \nstores. Again, I mention that because this is getting to the early \npart, getting kids to eat the proper foods, getting them tuned in to \nfresh fruits and vegetables at an early age. But there is so much we \nhave to do. It is time for the Federal Government to start moving in \nthat direction. If we do not, we are never going to be able to save \nMedicare and Medicaid, we are never going to be able to pay for it. It \nis going to bust us.\n  So we have to start preventing, we have to start keeping people \nhealthy in the first place. That is what this is all about--so that we \nhave taken some positive steps forward. They are small steps, kind of \nbaby steps, but I am convinced there is a solid, bipartisan consensus \nto pursue this course of wellness and prevention. I know that Senator \nFrist has been one of the great leaders in this area of prevention and \nwellness. I look forward to working on this agenda with my colleagues \nof both parties in the months ahead. I hope we can get a strong, \nbipartisan effort.\n  I hope the President, who, by the way, is a great example of physical \nfitness--though I may have some disagreements with the President on \nsome things, that is one thing I agree with him on. He is good at \nphysical fitness. He does not smoke. He does not drink.\n\n[[Page S1484]]\n\nAs far as I know, he eats well and exercises well.\n\n\n                      Wishing Senator Specter Well\n\n  Mr. President, I understand this is now on the news wires, so I want \nto comment on something that has just come to my attention this \nafternoon. I received a call from one of the best friends I have ever \nhad, a close friend here in the Senate, someone whom I have admired for \nhis personal qualities as well as for his senatorial qualities for so \nmany years. I have been privileged to work with him side by side now \ngoing back almost 20 years.\n  I received a call a little while ago from Senator Specter of \nPennsylvania, who informed me that doctors at the University of \nPennsylvania Hospital had diagnosed him with Hodgkin's disease. Well, \nit kind of took my breath away. There is no one for whom I have a \nhigher regard than Senator Arlen Specter. I think how hard he has \nworked to double the funding for NIH for basic research, and then to \nhave this happen. But he assured me that it is at an early stage. The \ndoctors have said he has an excellent chance of full recovery and will \nbe back here very soon after our break next week. He will have to \nundergo some treatments, but I understand the doctors say that Arlen \nSpecter has an excellent chance of full recovery.\n  I know all of my colleagues wish him the best. Our prayers are with \nhim. We know he is a strong person. He has a strong will. He is a \nperson of strong faith. And we know that his will and his faith will \ncarry him through. I know we will have Senator Specter back here with \nus leading the charge to make sure we address the real needs of health \ncare and biomedical research, to make sure we fulfill our obligations \nin education in this country, where he has been a great leader.\n  Again, Mr. President, we wish Senator Specter well, a full and speedy \nrecovery, and look forward to having him back here as soon as possible.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                              TITLE XVIII\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it has come to my attention that S. 306 \nincludes a provision to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act. \nAs chairman of the committee, I am obligated to point out that the \nFinance Committee has primary jurisdiction over title XVIII, as \namended. The provision in S. 306 that is within the jurisdiction of the \nFinance Committee amends title XVIII relating to Medicare supplemental \npolicies. I ask Chairman Enzi to acknowledge that the Senate Finance \nCommittee has jurisdiction over title XVIII of the Social Security Act \nand ask that he endeavor to consult on matters before the Health, \nEducation, Labor & Pensions Committee that touch on the Senate Finance \nCommittee's jurisdiction.\n  In order to avoid unnecessary confusion as to the jurisdiction of the \nFinance Committee or further delay in the consideration of this bill, I \nwould agree to accommodate your request to withhold any objection to \nthe Senate's consideration of S. 306 with the acknowledgment that this \nprovision and title XVIII generally are in the jurisdiction of the \nFinance Committee. This does not represent any waiver of jurisdiction \non the part of the Finance Committee on this subject.\n   I ask the chairman of the HELP Committee, Senator Enzi, whether he \nwould agree to this request.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I tell my friend that I do acknowledge that \ntitle XVIII of the Social Security Act is within the jurisdiction of \nthe Senate Finance Committee. The matter before the Senate makes \namendments to the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act and the \nPublic Health Service Act. The section to which you have raised \nconcerns was included as a conforming amendment to ensure consistency \nin Federal policy. I want to reassure my friend that I have every \nintention of respecting the jurisdiction of all Senate committees and \nwill endeavor to consult with him on all matters before my committee \nthat touch on the jurisdiction of the Senate Finance Committee. I ask \nmy friend to provide me the same courtesy.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree and will also endeavor to consult with the \nSenator on matters before the Senate Finance Committee that are in the \njurisdiction of the HELP Committee.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, all of us are privileged to be living in \nan era of unprecedented scientific discovery in the biological \nsciences. Since 1953, when James Watson and Francis Crick first \nidentified the structure of DNA or the double helix we have \nrelentlessly increased our ability to decipher an individual's \nhereditary information. At the time of their discovery, Watson and \nCrick said that they had ``found the secret of life'' and to be \ncertain, life, as we know it, has not been the same since.\n  Today, we have the entire genetic map--the human genome--that is \nrevealing a greater understanding of a range of diseases and their \ntreatment. We also have a much greater capacity to know an individual's \nbiological destiny as it is encoded in their DNA, which is essentially \na personal genetic blueprint of their current biology as well as a \npredictor of their biological future. The benefit of knowing this \ninformation cannot be overstated. It can save countless lives. Part of \nthe challenge of having this information is to ensure that it not be \nused unfairly to influence an individual's sociological destiny.\n  This is the reason I am joining with Senator Snowe and our other \ncolleagues in support of S. 306, the Genetic Information \nNondiscrimination Act of 2005. S. 306 will prohibit discrimination \nagainst individuals based on their genetic makeup in both health \ninsurance and employment. This legislation represents a major \ncontribution to civil rights law. It is a victory for consumers, health \ninsurers and health care providers; and it is a victory for employees \nand employers. It is the result of almost seven years of effort and it \nis identical to a measure that passed the Senate during the 108th \nCongress by a vote of 95 to 0.\n  Together with the much-deserved excitement over the potential of \ngenetic research, there have also been long-standing concerns that \ngenetic information, in the wrong hands, could be misused. Many people \nhave argued that an individual's genetic information which may indicate \na predisposition to a particular disease could be used to deny that \nindividual health insurance or employment opportunities. The promise of \nbetter health would instead become a potential for greater \ndiscrimination and disadvantage. The Genetic Information \nNondiscrimination Act of 2005 is designed to address those concerns.\n  Existing antidiscrimination law has been enacted over the years as a \nmeans of correcting longstanding abuses in voter rights, employment, \nhousing and education. However, under current law a person who has \nsuffered employment or health insurance discrimination because of their \ngenetic makeup has very little, if any, recourse to legal remedies. \nThis legislation addresses this problem by creating new enforceable \nrights for individuals similar to those available under existing civil \nrights, education and fair employment law.\n  It is important to note that to date, there has not been a pattern or \nclear prevalence of genetic discrimination. However, there is anecdotal \nevidence that people have refused to take genetic tests because of \ntheir fear that the predictive information would lead to \ndiscrimination. We know the science is rapidly moving forward and we \nare learning more every day about the ``predictive'' correlation \nbetween genetic markers and certain diseases. It is not difficult to \nimagine such discrimination occurring in the near future. So in a \nsense, we can take that rare opportunity to be ahead of the curve and \nenact legislation to preempt discriminatory practices and prevent them \nfrom ever happening.\n  I believe the compromise legislation we consider today will be \nsuccessful in preventing abuses in the insuring of health services and \nemployment. However, it is extremely important that we remain vigilant \nagainst this type of discrimination from ever getting a foothold in our \nsociety and if this measure proves insufficient and needs to be \nstrengthened, then we will be back to correct the problems and that \neffort will have my support.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the genesis of this legislation links to many \nyears of effort on the part of several of our colleagues. My friend, \nSenator Snowe, has for many years been the leader of one\n\n[[Page S1485]]\n\neffort in which I was proud to join, together with Senators Frist, \nEnzi, Collins and Hagel. In another keystone effort, the previous \nminority leader, Senator Daschle, joined with Senators Kennedy, Dodd \nand Harkin to delineate the need for employment protections. All have \ncontributed extensively to a better understanding of the many critical \nand complex definitions that are the heart of this legislation. We \ncould not have been successful last Congress in weaving an agreement \nbetween these bills without the commitment of Senator Gregg, who as \nchairman of the HELP Committee during the 108th Congress, devoted his \nenergies to finding a middle ground that made today's bipartisan \nagreements possible. Finally, I commend Senator Enzi, the current \nchairman of the HELP Committee, not only because he elevated the \nimportance of this bill by moving it to the front of the legislative \ncalendar, but also for the many years of effort he has dedicated to \nseeing this measure enacted. It is wholly appropriate that he is there \nas chairman to see it cross the legislative finish line.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased at the willingness both sides have shown \nto work through the many difficult aspects of this key issue. Through \nmany meetings and discussions, we have been able to reach agreements on \nan array of important issues that have improved and strengthened the \nlegislation. I look forward to continuing this cooperative approach as \nwe move to enact this important and landmark initiative and I urge our \ncolleagues in the House to pass it in the near. The President supports \nthis legislation, and it is my hope that we can enact it into law \nbefore the end of this Congress. I urge all of my colleagues to vote in \nits favor.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I rise today to express my support for S. 306, the \nGenetic Nondiscrimination Act. I am proud to be an original cosponsor \nof this bill, and I thank Senator Snowe for her leadership on this \nissue. I urge my colleagues to vote for passage of this important \nlegislation.\n  The Genetic Nondiscrimination Act is a crucial first step to \nprotecting individuals and families from genetic discrimination. This \nlegislation prevents insurers from denying coverage or raising premiums \nbased upon the results of genetic tests. It prohibits insurance \ncompanies and employers from requiring individuals to undergo genetic \ntesting. And finally, this legislation protects workers from employment \ndiscrimination based on their genetic information.\n  Genetic testing holds great promise for medicine. Knowing you are \nprone to cancer or heart disease or Lou Gehrig's disease may give you a \nfighting chance. But just try, with that information in hand, to get \nhealth insurance in a system without strong protections against \ndiscrimination for pre-existing or genetic conditions. As genetic \ninformation allows us to predict illness with greater certainty, these \ntests threaten to turn the most susceptible patients into the most \nvulnerable.\n  Each vaunted scientific breakthrough brings with it new challenges to \nour health system and this legislation will help maximize advancing \ntechnology's benefits while protecting Americans from the use of \ngenetic information as a tool for discrimination. With this bill, we \ncan help patients access the latest advances in science without \nsacrificing their personal privacy.\n  Genetic discrimination has many victims: those who are denied health \ncoverage, those who lose job opportunities, and those who forego \nimportant tests out of fear that they will be victimized. We should \nencourage people to learn more about their health so that they can make \ninformed decisions about treatment and care, not discourage them from \nseeking information with threats of unemployment or loss of insurance.\n  By passing the Genetic Nondiscrimination Act into law, we will \naddress at the Federal level an issue that has been recognized by a \nmajority of states. More than 40 States have enacted genetic \nnondiscrimination provisions, and I believe that it is far past the \ntime for Congress to follow suit.\n  I would also like to note that the Genetic Nondiscrimination Act, \nwhile a good first step, is only the beginning of our work in this \narea. Many who have long championed genetic nondiscrimination support \nstronger protections and tough enforcement provisions.\n  Passing the Genetic Nondiscrimination Act will help to put a \nnecessary framework in place and we will need the same commitment to \naction in the future to reinforce this framework, and provide strong, \nreliable enforcement for the important civil right that we are \ndefending today.\n  Again, I would urge my colleagues to support the passage of the \nGenetic Nondiscrimination Act. I also urge the House to take up this \nmatter as quickly as possible, to protect the millions of patients that \nmight benefit from genetic testing.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate is \nconsidering legislation designed to prohibit discrimination in health \ninsurance and employment based on genetic information.\n  In the last decade, biomedical researchers have made great strides in \ngenetic research. While these discoveries are critical to researching \ntreatments and, ultimately, discovering cures for many diseases, this \ninformation also has the potential to be used to deny health care \ninsurance or employment to an individual who has a genetic \npredisposition to an illness. That is why we must make it illegal for \nemployers and health insurers to discriminate against individuals on \nthe basis of their genetic information.\n  S. 306 is an important step, but it is only a first step. Any \nlegislation addressing this issue must include strong enforcement and \ndeterrence mechanisms. As this legislation moves forward, I hope its \nenforcement provisions will be strengthened. Without strong \naccountability provisions, there is little to deter employers and \nhealth insurers from using genetic information inappropriately.\n  In addition, I hope that when this legislation is conferenced, the \nconferees will find ways to strengthen the privacy provisions. It is \nessential that our laws keep pace with technological advances and that \nwe continue to protect the privacy of our citizens. Advances in \ntechnology cannot place fundamental American rights at risk.\n  Despite my concerns about the enforcement and privacy provisions, I \nbelieve this legislation is a critical first step and look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to continue addressing the important issue \nof genetic discrimination.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of S. 306, \nthe Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. Before I talk about why \nthis bill is so crucial, I want to thank the chairman and ranking \nmember of the HELP Committee, Senator Enzi and Senator Kennedy, for \ntheir efforts on this bill, and for making it one of their first \npriorities in the 109th Congress. Their action sends a strong signal \nabout the importance of this legislation.\n  I would be remiss if I did not also mention the dedication to this \nissue shown by our former Democratic leader, Senator Tom Daschle. We \nare in a position to pass this bill today as a direct result of the \nwork done by Senator Daschle.\n  Many of us, on both sides of the aisle, saw the need several years \nago for legally enforceable rules to maximize the potential benefits of \ngenetic information--and minimize its potential dangers. I have worked \non this issue with many of my colleagues since the 105th Congress. I \nhave chaired a hearing in the HELP Committee, and I have introduced \nlegislation with several of my colleagues, notably Senator Daschle, \nSenator Kennedy, and Senator Harkin, going back to the 106th Congress.\n  The legislation that we will consider today is a bipartisan \ncompromise between our bill, and a similar bill introduced by Senator \nSnowe and others. It represents a culmination of the efforts of many of \nus to establish such rules. It is an enormous step forward, and I would \nlike to acknowledge the hard work of everyone who was involved in \ncrafting this legislation.\n  Over the past decade, the science of genetics has developed at an \nastonishing pace. The mapping of the human genome is undoubtedly one of \nthe greatest scientific achievements of this generation. We have not \neven completely grasped the wide array of potential benefits that may \ncome from our newfound genetic knowledge.\n  Certainly, the impact on our health will be profound. Doctors will be \nable\n\n[[Page S1486]]\n\nto read our unique genetic blueprints and predict the likelihood of \ndeveloping diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's, or Parkinson's. They \nwill also be able to use an individual's genetic information to develop \ntreatments for these same diseases, and target individuals with the \ntreatment that will work best for them. This is not science fiction. It \nis already beginning to happen.\n  For all the promise of the genetic age, there is also an inherent \nthreat. Science has outpaced the law and Americans are worried, and \nrightly so, that their genetic information will be used--not to improve \ntheir health--but to deny them health insurance or employment. There is \nno information more personal and private than genetic information--and \nno information more worthy of special protection. Our genetic code is \nthe very blueprint of our selves. It is with us from birth, and to some \nextent it determines who we will become. What an incredibly powerful \ntool, with its vast potential to help us live healthier lives. But the \nnature of genetic information also makes it dangerous to the individual \nif used incorrectly.\n  This bill provides significant new protections against the misuse of \ngenetic information. It ensures that Americans who are genetically \npredisposed to health conditions will not lose or be denied health \ninsurance, jobs, or promotions based on their genetic makeup. Reaching \nan agreement on this legislation means that our laws dealing with \ngenetic information can begin to catch up to the reality of our \ntechnological capability in the field.\n  With these protections in place, individuals need not feel reluctant \nto get the tests that may save or improve their lives. Although the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, ADA, and the Health Insurance \nPortability and Accountability Act, HIPAA, took important steps towards \npreventing genetic discrimination, this legislation is more \nspecifically tailored to prohibiting its misuse. Health plans and \nhealth insurance issuers will not be allowed to underwrite, determine \npremiums, or decide on eligibility for enrollment based on genetic \ninformation. Employers will not be allowed to alter hiring practices \nbased on genetic information. The American public can feel secure in \nthe knowledge that their genetic blueprint will not be used to harm \nthem, that a genetic marker indicating a possible illness later in life \nwill not cause them to lose a job or health insurance.\n  Like any compromise, this bill is not perfect. In particular, while \nit poses some important limitations on the collection of personal \ngenetic information by insurance companies, it would allow them to \ncollect this information, without consent, once an individual is \nenrolled in a health plan. While insurers are expressly prohibited from \nusing this information for the purposes of underwriting, I am concerned \nthat once they have this information, it may be difficult to control \nhow it is used and who has access to it. We all know from experience \nthat the difficulty of protecting information increases exponentially \nwith each additional person who has access to that information. As this \nbill becomes law--and I sincerely hope it will--I will monitor closely \nhow it is implemented, and the extent to which privacy is protected. We \nmay need to revisit this issue in the future.\n  Mr. President, despite this shortcoming, I support this bill, as it \nrepresents a vast improvement over current law in many ways. I hope \nthat it will become law in the very near future. This Chamber passed a \nsimilar bill last year by a vote of 95 to 0. Unfortunately, the House \ndid not take up this important legislation. I urge them to do so as \nsoon as possible. We all should feel free to make our health care \ndecisions based on our health care needs, not based on fear.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the attached \nstatement from the Office of Compliance be printed in the Record today \npursuant to section 304(b)(1) of the Congressional Accountability Act \nof 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1384(b)(1)).\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        FROM THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE OFFICE OF COMPLIANCE\n\n     Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, and Request for Comments From \n       Interested Parties\n\n       NEW PROPOSED REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTING CERTAIN SUBSTANTIVE \n     EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS FOR VETERANS, AS REQUIRED \n     BY 2 U.S.C. 1316a, THE CONGRESSIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF \n     1995, AS AMENDED (CAA).\n\n                               Background\n\n       The purpose of this Notice is to issue proposed substantive \n     regulations which will implement the 1998 amendment to the \n     CAA which applies certain veterans' employment rights and \n     protections to employing offices and employees covered by the \n     CAA.\n\n     What is the authority under the CAA for these proposed \n     substantive regulations? In 1998, the CAA was amended through \n     addition of 2 U.S.C. 1316a, a provision of the Veterans' \n     Employment Opportunities Act of 1998 (VEOA), which states in \n     relevant part: ``The rights and protections established under \n     section 2108, sections 3309 through 3312, and subchapter I of \n     chapter 35 of Title 5, shall apply to covered employees.'' As \n     will be described in greater detail below, these sections of \n     Title 5 accord certain hiring and retention rights to \n     veterans of the uniformed services. Section 1316a(4)(B) \n     states that ``The regulations issued . . . shall be the same \n     as the most relevant substantive regulations (applicable with \n     respect to the Executive Branch)\n\n[[Page S1487]]\n\n     promulgated to implement the statutory provisions . . . \n     except insofar as the Board may determine for good cause \n     shown and stated together with the regulation, that a \n     modification of such regulations would be more effective for \n     the implementation of the rights and protections under this \n     section.''\n\n     Will these regulations, if approved, apply to all employees \n     otherwise covered by the CAA? No. Subsection (5) of 2 U.S.C. \n     1316a, states that, for the purpose of application of these \n     veterans' employment rights, the term ``covered employee'' \n     shall not apply to any employee of an employing office: (A) \n     whose appointment is made by the President with the advice \n     and consent of the Senate; (B) whose appointment is made by a \n     Member of Congress or by a committee or subcommittee of \n     either House of Congress; or (C) who is appointed to a \n     position, the duties of which are equivalent to those of a \n     Senior Executive Service position. . . .'' These regulations \n     would apply to all other covered employees.\n\n     Do other veterans' employment rights apply via the CAA to \n     Legislative Branch employing offices and covered employees? \n     Yes. Another statutory scheme regarding veterans' and armed \n     forces members' employment rights is incorporated in part \n     through section 206 of the Congressional Accountability Act \n     of 1995 (CAA). Section 206 of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 1316, applies \n     certain provisions of Title 38 of the U.S. Code regarding \n     ``Employment and Reemployment Rights of Members of the \n     Uniformed Services.'' Section 206 of the CAA also requires \n     the Board of Directors to issue substantive regulations \n     patterned upon the regulations promulgated by the Secretary \n     of Labor to implement the Title 38 rights of members of the \n     uniformed services. As of this date, the Secretary of Labor \n     has not finally promulgated any such regulations. Therefore, \n     regulations implementing CAA section 206 rights will not be \n     proposed by the Board until the Labor Department regulations \n     have been promulgated. The proposed regulations in this \n     Notice are not based on section 206 of the CAA, but solely on \n     the other veterans' rights referenced in 2 U.S.C. 1316a.\n\n     What are the veterans' employment rights applied to covered \n     employees and employing offices in 2 U.S.C. 1316a? In \n     recognition of their duty to country, sacrifice, and \n     exceptional capabilities and skills, the United States \n     government has accorded veterans a preference in federal \n     employment through a series of statutes and Executive Orders, \n     beginning as the Civil War drew to a close. While \n     interpreting regulations have been modified over time, many \n     of the current core statutory protections have remained \n     largely unchanged since they were first codified in the \n     historic Veterans' Preference Act of 1944, Act of June 27, \n     1944, ch. 287, 58 Stat. 387, amended and codified in various \n     provisions of Title 5, U.S.C. In 1998, Congress passed the \n     Veterans Employment Opportunities Act (``VEOA''), Pub. L. \n     105-339, 112 Stat. 3186 (October 31, 1998), which \n     ``strengthen[s] and broadens''(Sen. Rept. 105-340, 105 Cong., \n     2d Sess. at 19 (Sept. 21, 1998)) the rights and remedies \n     available to military veterans who are entitled to preferred \n     consideration in hiring and in retention during reductions in \n     force (``RIFs''). Among other provisions of the VEOA, \n     Congress clearly stated, in the law itself, that henceforth \n     the ``rights and protections'' of certain veterans' \n     preference law provisions, originally drafted to cover \n     certain Executive Branch employees, ``shall apply'' to \n     certain ``covered employees'' in the Legislative Branch. VEOA \n     Sec. Sec. 4(c)(1) and (5) (emphasis added).\n\n       The selected statutory sections which Congress determined \n     ``shall apply'' to covered employees in the Legislative \n     Branch include, first, a definitional section describing the \n     categories of military veterans who are entitled to \n     preference (``preference eligibles''). 5 U.S.C. Sec. 2108. \n     Generally, a veteran must be disabled or have served on \n     active duty in the Armed Forces during certain specified time \n     periods or in specified military campaigns to be entitled to \n     preference. In addition, certain family members (mainly \n     spouses, widow[er]s, and mothers) of preference eligible \n     veterans are entitled to the same rights and protections.\n       The VEOA also makes applicable to the Legislative Branch \n     certain statutory preferences in hiring. In the hiring \n     process, a preference eligible individual who is tested or \n     otherwise numerically evaluated for a position is entitled to \n     have either 5 or 10 points added to his/her score, depending \n     on his/her military service, or disabling condition. 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3309. Where experience is a qualifying element for a \n     job, a preference eligible individual is entitled to credit \n     for having relevant experience in the military or in various \n     civil activities. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3311. Where physical \n     requirements (age, height, weight) are a qualifying element \n     for a position, preference eligible individuals (including \n     those who are disabled) may obtain a waiver of such \n     requirements in certain circumstances. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3512.\n       For certain positions (guards, elevator operators, \n     messengers, custodians), only preference eligible individuals \n     may be considered for hiring so long as such individuals are \n     available. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3310. (These statutory provisions on \n     hiring in the Executive Branch apply specifically to the \n     competitive service; this point will be discussed further \n     below.)\n\n     Finally, in prescribing retention rights during Reductions In \n     Force for Executive Branch positions (in both the competitive \n     and in the excepted service), the sections in subchapter I of \n     chapter 35 of Title 5, U.S.C., with a slightly modified \n     definition of ``preference eligible,'' require that employing \n     agencies retain an employee with retention preference in \n     preference to other competing employees, provided that the \n     employee's performance has not been rated unacceptable. 5 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 3502(c) (emphasis added).\n\n       Along with this explicit command to retain qualifying \n     employees with retention preference, agencies are to follow \n     regulations governing the release of competing employees, \n     giving ``due effect'' to the following factors: (a) \n     employment tenure (i.e., type of appointment); (b) veterans' \n     preference; (c) length of service; and, (d) performance \n     ratings. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3502(a). 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3502 also \n     requires certain notification procedures, providing, inter \n     alia, that an employing agency must provide an employee with \n     60 days written notice (the period may be reduced in certain \n     circumstances) prior to being released during a RIF. 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3502(d)(1). Certain protections also apply in connection \n     with a transfer of agency functions from one agency to \n     another. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3503. In addition, where physical \n     requirements (age, height, weight) are a qualifying element \n     for retention, preference eligible individuals (including \n     those with disabilities) may obtain a waiver of such \n     requirements in certain circumstances. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3504.\n\n     Are there veterans' employment regulations already in force \n     under the CAA? No.\n\n                          Procedurals Summary\n\n     How are substantive regulations proposed and approved under \n     the CAA? Pursuant to section 304 of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 1384, \n     the procedure for promulgating such substantive regulations \n     requires that: (1) the Board of Directors adopt proposed \n     substantive regulations and publish a general notice of \n     proposed rulemaking in the Congressional Record; (2) there be \n     a comment period of at least 30 days after the date of \n     publication of the general notice of proposed rulemaking; (3) \n     after consideration of comments by the Board of Directors, \n     that the Board adopt regulations and transmit notice of such \n     action together with the regulations and a recommendation \n     regarding the method for Congressional approval of the \n     regulations to the Speaker of the House and President pro \n     tempore of the Senate for publication in the Congressional \n     Record; (4) committee referral and action on the proposed \n     regulations by resolution in each House, concurrent \n     resolution, or by joint resolution; and (5) final publication \n     of the approved regulations in the Congressional Record, with \n     an effective date prescribed in the final publication. For \n     more detail, please reference the text of 2 U.S.C. 1384. This \n     Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is step (1) of the outline set \n     forth above.\n\n     Are these proposed regulations also recommended by the Office \n     of Compliance's Executive Director, the Deputy Executive \n     Director for the House of Representatives, and the Deputy \n     Executive Director for the Senate? As required by section \n     304(b)(1) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 1384(b)(1), the substance of \n     these regulations is also recommended by the Executive \n     Director, the Deputy Executive Director for the House of \n     Representatives and the Acting Deputy Executive Director for \n     the Senate.\n\n     Has the Board of Directors previously proposed substantive \n     regulations implementing these veterans' employment rights \n     and benefits pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 1316a? Yes. On February 28, \n     2000, and March 9, 2000, the Office published an Advanced \n     Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (``ANPR'') in the Congressional \n     Record (144 Cong. Rec. S862 (daily ed., Feb. 28, 2000), H916 \n     (daily ed., March 9, 2000)). On December 6, 2001, upon \n     consideration of the comments to the ANPR, the Office \n     published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (``NPR'') in the \n     Congressional Record ( 147 Cong. Rec. S12539 (daily ed. Dec. \n     6, 2001), H9065 (daily ed. Dec. 6, 2001)). The Board has not \n     acted further on those earlier Notices, and has decided to \n     issue this Notice as the first step in a new effort to \n     promulgate implementing regulations.\n       As noted above, 2 U.S.C. 1316a mandates application to the \n     Legislative Branch of certain statutory provisions originally \n     drafted for the Executive Branch. In its initial proposed \n     rules, the Board noted that this statutory command raised the \n     quandary of determining which Legislative Branch employees \n     should be covered by which statutory provisions. There are \n     longstanding and significant differences between the \n     personnel policies and practices within these two branches. \n     For instance, the Executive Branch distinguishes between \n     employees in the ``competitive service'' and the ``excepted \n     service,'' often with differing personnel rules applying to \n     these two services. The Legislative Branch has no such \n     dichotomy.\n       When Congress directed in the VEOA that certain veterans' \n     employment rights and protections currently applicable to \n     Executive Branch employees shall be made applicable to \n     Legislative Branch employees, the Board took note of a \n     central distinction made in the underlying statute: certain \n     veterans' preference protections (regarding hiring) applied \n     only to Executive Branch employees in the ``competitive'' \n     service, while others (governing reductions in force and \n     transfers) applied both to the ``competitive'' and \n     ``excepted'' service.\n       The Board's initial approach in 2000 was to maintain this \n     distinction by attempting to discern which Legislative Branch \n     employees should be considered as working in positions \n     equivalent to the ``competitive'' service, and\n\n[[Page S1488]]\n\n     which should be considered equivalent to the ``excepted'' \n     service. At that point, the Board concluded that all \n     Legislative Branch employees, with certain possible \n     exceptions (such as those of the Office of the Architect of \n     the Capitol) should be considered excepted service employees. \n     The Board therefore issued regulations, closely following \n     Office of Personnel Management (``OPM'') regulations for the \n     various statutory provisions, with the caveat that the \n     regulations governing hiring would apply only to those \n     employees whom the Board currently deemed working at jobs \n     equivalent to the competitive service (e.g. the Office of the \n     Architect of the Capitol). The NPR acknowledged: ``The Board \n     recognizes that the adoption of these definitions (e.g., \n     competitive and excepted services], consistent with the \n     mandate of section 225 [of the CAA], yields an unusual result \n     in that no ``covered employee'' in the Legislative Branch \n     currently satisfies the definition of ``competitive \n     service.'' Moreover, as the substantive protections of \n     veterans'' preference in Legislative Branch appointment apply \n     only to ``competitive service' positions, the regulations \n     which the Board proposes regarding preference in appointment \n     would with one noted exception [employees appointed under the \n     Architect of the Capitol Human Resources Act], currently \n     apply to no one. . . .'' This left the Board in the position \n     of drafting intricate regulations that may have applied to \n     only a minority of ``covered employees,'' or perhaps even to \n     no ``covered employees'' at all--a result in obvious tension \n     with the VEOA's statutory mandate that these veterans' \n     protections ``shall apply'' to ``covered employees'' in the \n     Legislative Branch.\n       The Board received Comments to its initial proposed \n     regulations from the Office of the Architect of the Capitol, \n     the Office of House Employment Counsel, and the Office of the \n     Senate Chief Counsel for Employment, all finding fault with \n     the initial approach. The Comments generally included the \n     following observations. First, commenting offices noted that \n     the Board's approach of drafting intricate regulations that \n     may not apply to any covered employees creates more problems \n     than it solves. This approach was seen as ``impracticable,'' \n     ``obfuscating'' the true sense of the VEOA and what \n     requirements in fact must apply to employing offices; it was \n     seen, in effect, as an attempt to ``place a square peg in a \n     round hole.'' Others charged that the adoption of such \n     regulations went beyond the Board's statutory authorization, \n     and would require, without basis in law, the employing \n     offices to adopt complicated procedures, some governing \n     employment decisions that affected only non-veteran \n     applicants or employees. A commenting office also complained \n     about the application of terms ``foreign and inapplicable'' \n     to its personnel system. Employing offices also submitted \n     that statutes drafted for the Executive Branch competitive \n     service should not apply at all to any Legislative Branch \n     employee.\n       Furthermore, one employing office commented that such \n     modification of OPM regulations does not constitute an \n     adoption of the ``most relevant regulations,'' as regulations \n     that apply to no covered employees can not possibly be the \n     most relevant regulations applicable. As another commenting \n     office aptly put it, ``Unfortunately, the unintended result \n     could very well be that the underlying principles of the \n     veterans' preference laws would lie fallow while the affected \n     legislative branch entities struggle with the task of \n     adopting civil-service type personnel management systems.'' \n     Comments of the Office of House Employment Counsel, Feb. 6, \n     2002 at 9. Additionally, all three employing offices argued \n     that the Board should issue three individual sets of \n     regulations (to pertain to the Senate, House, and covered \n     Congressional instrumentalities), rather than one set. \n     Finally, the Office of the Architect of the Capitol also \n     argued that the Architect of the Capitol Human Resources Act \n     did not create a competitive service in the sense of the \n     veterans' preference laws.\n\n     How are the regulations being proposed in this Notice \n     different from those regulations which the Board previously \n     proposed? In the period since the initial proposed \n     regulations were issued by the Board of Directors and \n     commented upon by various stakeholders, the Office of \n     Compliance has engaged in extensive informal discussions with \n     various stakeholders across Congress and the Legislative \n     Branch, in an effort to ascertain how best to effect the \n     basic purposes of veterans' employment rights in the \n     Legislative Branch.\n       After careful consultation and deliberation, the Board is \n     issuing new proposed regulations which differ in many \n     respects from the initial proposed regulations. The new \n     approach is responsive to the clear statutory mandate \n     contained in the VEOA, and to various Comments regarding the \n     initial proposed regulations. This approach also applies \n     insights gained from the informal discussions with \n     stakeholders.\n       The Board has decided to apply the plain language of the \n     statutory provisions to all covered employees in the \n     Legislative Branch. By doing so, the Board avoids what \n     commenting employing offices styled as the ``anomaly'' of \n     complicated regulations which would practically apply to no \n     employees, an anomaly which not only poorly served the clear \n     Congressional intent that protections ``shall apply to \n     covered employees,'' but which also created confusion for the \n     employing offices.\n       Not only is application of these rights to all covered \n     employees compelled by the plain language of the statute, the \n     legislative history of the VEOA also clearly indicates that \n     the principles of veterans' preference protections must be \n     applied in the Legislative Branch. The authoritative report \n     of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs (Senate Report \n     105-340, pages 15 & 17), recognized that the competitive \n     service did not exist in the Legislative Branch, and that 2 \n     U.S.C. 1316a did not require the establishment of such a \n     competitive service. Nonetheless, the Committee noted that \n     veterans' preference principles should be incorporated into \n     the Legislative Branch personnel systems.\n       For these reasons, the Board is persuaded that Congress, in \n     enacting the VEOA's extension of veterans' employment rights \n     to the Legislative Branch, intended a broad application to \n     all CAA covered employees, except for the staff of those \n     employing offices in the House of Representatives and the \n     Senate which Congress specifically excluded from coverage in \n     section 206a(5) of the CAA (2 U.S.C. Sec. 1316a(5)).This \n     result is faithful to the statutory language. Furthermore, \n     the Board has concluded, for the reasons stated above, that \n     the most relevant substantive Executive Branch OPM \n     regulations are at times inapposite to a meaningful \n     implementation of the VEOA in the Legislative Branch, such \n     that a modification of the regulations is necessary for the \n     effective implementation of the rights and protections under \n     the VEOA. As a result, the Office is proposing regulations \n     that reflect the principles of the veterans' preference laws, \n     as discussed by the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, \n     without linking such coverage to employees or positions with \n     competitive service status.\n       Furthermore, the Board has also taken note of the \n     legislative history suggesting that employing offices with \n     employees covered by the VEOA should create systems \n     incorporating these veterans' preference principles: ``The \n     Committee notes that the requirement that veterans' \n     preference principles be extended to the legislative and \n     judicial branches does not mandate the creation of civil \n     service-type evaluation or scoring systems by these hiring \n     entities. It does require, however, that they create systems \n     that are consistent with the underlying principles of \n     veterans' preference laws.'' Sen. Comm. Report at 17. The \n     implementation of that provision in the Senate Report can \n     only be accomplished by the employing offices.\n       In their Comments, employing offices strongly expressed \n     their need to preserve their autonomy in determining and \n     administering their respective personnel systems. For \n     example, the Office of the Architect of the Capitol commented \n     that it was incumbent upon the employing offices to create \n     ``systems that are consistent with the underlying principles \n     of veterans'' preference laws,'' pursuant to the Senate \n     Committee Report. The Board agrees, and the newly proposed \n     regulations allow employing offices to do so. What the \n     regulations also do is clearly define the ``underlying \n     principles of veterans'' preference laws'' made applicable to \n     these employing offices, so as to provide a benchmark for the \n     employing offices, applicants, and covered employees, as to \n     whether the systems developed are consistent with these \n     principles.\n\n     What is the approach taken by these revamped proposed \n     substantive regulations? The Board has taken great heed to \n     avoid the intricate, OPM-like regulations that formed the \n     basis for its first proposed regulations. Under the current \n     proposed regulations, employing offices will retain their \n     wide latitude, not similarly enjoyed by many employing \n     agencies in the Executive Branch, to devise and administer \n     their own unique and often flexible personnel systems. \n     However, employing offices with covered employees must \n     incorporate into these individual personnel systems the basic \n     veterans' preference protections under the specific statutory \n     mandate that Congress issued in the VEOA, and they must carry \n     out the administration of these veterans' preference \n     provisions in a manner consistent with the Board's commitment \n     to promoting administrative transparency and accountability.\n       Under this approach, employing offices with the specified \n     covered employees must meet the requirements contained in the \n     statutory mandate of the VEOA, but need not necessarily adopt \n     any of the trappings of an OPM-like personnel system. Thus, \n     should such an employing office choose to administer numeric \n     evaluations of applicants for a position, it must add to a \n     preference eligible's evaluation the points called for in the \n     veterans' preference statutes. If it does not numerically \n     evaluate applicants, it must determine how it will factor \n     veterans' preference status into its employee evaluations and \n     hiring decisions at a level commensurate with the statutory \n     directive. Similarly, should an employing office currently \n     have a policy of placing covered employees who may be \n     potentially subject to a reduction in force on a retention \n     register, it must rank said employees taking into account the \n     directives of the veterans' preference statute. Should an \n     employing office elect not to keep formal retention \n     registers, nothing in these regulations requires it to start \n     doing so. It still must, however, follow the statutory \n     mandate to provide certain veterans' preferences in the \n     course of a reduction in force that affects employees covered \n     by the VEOA.\n       The goal of preserving employing office autonomy in \n     fashioning personnel systems has\n\n[[Page S1489]]\n\n     further compelled the Board to minimize the impact of these \n     proposed regulations on employment decisions not directly \n     involving preference eligibles. Thus, unlike the initial \n     proposed regulations, should an employing office properly \n     determine that no preference eligibles are qualified \n     applicants, or that no preference eligibles are subject to a \n     RIF, these proposed regulations are designed so as not to \n     govern the employment decisions taken by the employing \n     office. By allowing for such employing office autonomy, the \n     Board hopes to allay the concerns of some of the employing \n     offices, expressed in the initial Comments, that a ``morass'' \n     of intricate regulations would apply to decisions that did \n     not affect preference eligibles. (One isolated, but necessary \n     exception to this approach limiting the effect of the \n     regulations to personnel actions involving preference \n     eligibles is proposed Sec. 1.115, governing the transfer of \n     functions between one employing office and another, and the \n     replacement of one employing office by another. This section \n     provides protections for all covered employees, as the term \n     is defined and limited in the VEOA, including non-preference \n     eligibles. The clear statutory language of 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3503 \n     (applying to both the competitive and excepted services) \n     commands this result. Congress chose to include this broad \n     statutory provision in the set of provisions made applicable \n     to the Legislative Branch in the VEOA.)\n       The overall discretion and autonomy reserved to employing \n     offices to administer veterans' preference protections within \n     the context of their personnel systems comes with a \n     responsibility on the part of the employing offices to \n     provide all applicants for covered positions and all covered \n     employees with certain notice and informational rights, as \n     discussed below. This is to ensure that employing offices are \n     equipped with all information necessary to determine and \n     administer veterans' preference eligibility and that such \n     applicants and employees are properly informed of how their \n     employing office has chosen to give life to the veterans' \n     preference protections.\n       In sum, should an employing offices already use personnel \n     policies and procedures similar to those in the competitive \n     service, it must factor in the various veterans' preference \n     protections with respect to applicants for covered positions \n     and covered employees. If an employing office chooses to \n     follow more flexible, or merely different, personnel policies \n     from those referenced in the competitive service, it may do \n     so--but may not refuse to apply the veterans' preferences \n     called for in the statute. This would contravene the clear \n     statutory directive to affirmatively apply the veterans' \n     preference protections to the specified covered employees in \n     the Legislative Branch.\n       In proposing these regulations, the Board has sought to \n     remain faithful to the explicit statutory language of the \n     VEOA. In some cases, we have been guided by OPM veterans' \n     preference implementing regulations. In many cases, ``for \n     good cause shown,'' we have not adopted the OPM regulations \n     so as to tailor simpler and more streamlined regulations. We \n     have issued proposed regulations based on the direct \n     statutory language whenever possible, reserving \n     implementation to the individual employing offices, who then \n     are charged with crafting their own processes and procedures \n     for integrating veterans' preference protections within their \n     personnel systems.\n       Therefore, in accord with 2 U.S.C.1316a(4)(B), which \n     mandates that ``the Board may determine, for good cause shown \n     and stated . . . a modification of such regulations would be \n     more effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections under this section,'' these proposed regulations \n     may not track the most relevant substantive regulations \n     applicable with respect to the Executive Branch. However, the \n     proposed regulations endeavor, to the maximum practical \n     extent, to effect the veterans' preference principles that \n     Congress made applicable to the Legislative Branch through \n     section 206a(2) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1316a(2).\n\n     What responsibilities would employing offices have in \n     effectively implementing these regulations? The Board is \n     charging the employing offices with the responsibility of \n     duly factoring the veterans' preference principles into their \n     individualized hiring and retention processes. We will \n     require that such measures be substantive and verifiable. \n     Otherwise, VEOA implementation would be illusory and the \n     Office's remedial responsibility under 2 U.S.C.1316a(3) might \n     be compromised.\n       Therefore, the proposed regulations would require that all \n     employing offices with covered employees or seeking \n     applicants for covered positions develop a written program, \n     within 120 days of the Congressional approval of the \n     regulations, setting forth each employing office's modality \n     for effecting the veterans' preference principles in its \n     hiring and retention systems. These programs would \n     demonstrate each employing office's efforts to comply with \n     the VEOA. However, technical promulgation of such procedures \n     does not per se relieve an employing office of substantive \n     compliance with the VEOA.\n       Similarly, Subpart E of the proposed regulations contains \n     various important provisions governing recordkeeping, \n     dissemination of VEOA policies, written notice prior to a \n     RIF, and informational requirements regarding veterans' \n     preference determinations. Certain of these provisions \n     (notably that requiring written notice prior to a RIF) derive \n     directly from statutory provisions made applicable to covered \n     employees by the VEOA. The Board has adopted others so as to \n     ensure that the employing offices, which have significant \n     autonomy and discretion in integrating the veterans' \n     preference requirements into their personnel systems, \n     administer the preferences in a way that promotes \n     accountability and transparency. In response to the earlier \n     Comments of the employing offices, however, the Board has \n     refrained from adopting more burdensome procedural \n     requirements, such as keeping formal retention registers (see \n     5 CFR Sec. 351.505).\n\n     Are there substantive differences in the proposed regulations \n     for the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the other \n     employing offices? No. The Board of Directors has identified \n     no ``good cause'' for varying the text of these regulations. \n     Therefore, if these proposed regulations are approved as \n     proposed, there will be one text applicable to all employing \n     offices and covered employees.\n\n     Are these proposed substantive regulations available to \n     persons with disabilities in an alternate format? This Notice \n     of Proposed Regulations is available on the Office of \n     Compliance web site, www.compliance.gov, which is compliant \n     with section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as \n     amended, 29 U.S.C. 794d.

The CAA applies the rights and protections of 11 \n     federal labor and employment statutes to covered employees \n     and employing offices within the Legislative Branch of \n     Government. The CAA was amended by adding 2 U.S.C. 1316a as \n     part of the enactment of the Veterans' Employment \n     Opportunities Act of 1998 (VEOA), PL 105-339, section 4(c), \n     to provide additional substantive employment rights for \n     veterans. Those additional rights are the subject of these \n     regulations. Section 301 of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1381) \n     establishes the Office of Compliance as an independent office \n     within the Legislative Branch.\n\n    More Detailed Discussion of the Text of the Proposed Regulations\n\n\n    subpart a--matters of general applicability to all regulations \n                promulgated under section 4 of the veoa\n\n       1.101  Purpose and scope. This section clarifies that the \n     purpose of these regulations is to ensure that the principles \n     of the veterans' preference laws are integrated into the \n     employing offices' existing employment and retention policies \n     and processes, as per the explicit statutory mandate \n     contained in the VEOA. Additionally, through these \n     regulations, the Board seeks to fulfill its goal of achieving \n     transparency in the application of veterans' preference in \n     covered appointment and retention decisions.\n       Finally, it is noted that nothing in these regulations \n     shall be construed to require an employing office to reduce \n     any existing veterans' preference rights and protections that \n     it may currently afford to preference eligible individuals. \n     Any employing agencies that currently provide greater \n     veterans' preferences than required by these regulations may \n     retain them. Note also that, while the VEOA does not directly \n     cover the GAO, GPO, or Library of Congress, should Congress \n     extend Board jurisdiction over any of these entities in the \n     future, it should take their existing veterans' preference \n     policies into account, which may be based on independent \n     statutory mandates. Note, for example, that 31 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 732(h)(1) already mandates that the GAO must afford \n     veterans' preferences\n\n[[Page S1490]]\n\n     (largely similar to those in subchapter I of chapter 35 of \n     title 5 U.S.C.).\n       1.102  General definitions. This section provides \n     straightforward definitions of key terms referred to in the \n     regulations. Several of the definitions are derived from the \n     statutory provisions made applicable via the VEOA, including \n     ``veteran,'' from 5 U.S.C. Sec. 2108(1), ``disabled veteran'' \n     from 5 U.S.C. Sec. 2108(2), and ``preference eligible'' from \n     5 U.S.C. Sec. 2108(3). It also contains several other \n     definitions included for explanatory purposes.\n       The term ``appointment'' is defined as an individual's \n     appointment to employment in a covered position. Consistent \n     with the OPM regulations in 5 C.F.R. Sec. 211.102(c), the \n     term excludes inservice placement actions such as promotions. \n     The term ``covered employee'' follows the language of section \n     101(3) of the CAA, as limited by section 4(c)(5) of the VEOA. \n     Section 4(c)(5) of the VEOA excludes employees whose \n     appointment is made by a committee or subcommittee of either \n     House of Congress. The Board believes this statutory \n     exclusion extends to joint committees and has expressly \n     excluded such employees from the definition of ``covered \n     employee''.\n       The term ``qualified applicant,'' while not directly \n     originating in the text of U.S.C. Title V, is used to capture \n     the principle in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3309 that only a preference \n     eligible applicant who has received a passing grade in an \n     examination or evaluation for entrance into the competitive \n     service need receive additional points accorded to his or her \n     application (except for certain ``restricted'' positions, \n     discussed below). ``Qualified applicant'' is borrowed from \n     the Americans with Disabilities Act (``ADA,'' 42 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 12101 et seq.) as applied by section 102(a)(3) of the \n     CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1302(a)(3). The ADA's reference to \n     ``requisite skill, experience, education and other minimum \n     job-related requirements'' has been shortened to ``requisite \n     minimum job-related requirements,'' as not every job may \n     require a particular level of acquired skill, experience, or \n     education.\n       As will be discussed further, we are not requiring an \n     employing office to establish any particular prerequisites or \n     type of evaluation or examination system for applicants. \n     Instead, the term ``qualified applicant'' serves as a means \n     of implementing the statutory mandate that only preference \n     eligible applicants with ``passing scores'' receive \n     preference in the hiring process in the context of \n     appointment processes that do not involve ``scoring'' or \n     similar numeric evaluation.\n       Where the employing office does not use a numerically \n     scored entrance examination or evaluation, we have authorized \n     the employing office to make the determination of whether the \n     applicant is minimally ``qualified'' for a covered position. \n     In doing so, the employing office may rely on any job-related \n     requirements or on any evaluation system, formal or \n     otherwise, which it chooses to employ in assessing and rating \n     applicants for covered positions, provided that the employing \n     office in no way seeks to create or manipulate a standard as \n     to whether an applicant is ``qualified'' so as to avoid \n     obligations imposed upon it by the VEOA.\n       If, however, the employing office uses an entrance \n     examination or evaluation that is numerically scored, the \n     term ``qualified applicant'' shall mean that the applicant \n     has obtained a passing score on the examination or \n     evaluation. The Board notes that it expects the level of \n     ``passing scores'' to be roughly comparable to that in the \n     OPM regulations (70 points on a 100 point scale; 5 CFR \n     Sec. 337.101). We are not requiring employing offices to \n     administer entrance exams at all, or to model an exam or the \n     grading thereof after OPM's models. However, employing \n     offices may not set the bar on a scored entrance examination \n     or evaluation for a covered position so high that minimally \n     qualified preference eligible applicants cannot pass. \n     Moreover, the determination of what will constitute a \n     ``passing score'' should be made and communicated to \n     applicants before they are evaluated or sit for the entrance \n     examination.\n       1.103  Adoption of regulations. This section details the \n     process by which the regulations shall be adopted. It also \n     clarifies that, as discussed extensively in the prefatory \n     comments, supra, the Board has at times deviated from the \n     regulations which otherwise were most applicable, i.e. the \n     regulations issued by OPM implementing these selected \n     provisions of U.S.C. Title V. When the Board has so deviated \n     from the OPM regulations, it has done so in an effort to \n     implement the statutory language of the VEOA in a way that \n     respects the autonomy of employing offices' personnel systems \n     and avoids placing undue administrative burdens upon these \n     offices, and that otherwise respects the legislative intent \n     of the VEOA.\n       1.104  Coordination with section 225 of the Congressional \n     Accountability Act. This section notes that the VEOA requires \n     that regulations promulgated are consistent with section 225 \n     of the CAA. These proposed regulations are consistent with \n     section 225; the regulations follow CAA principles contained \n     therein, including applying CAA definitions and exemptions, \n     and reserving enforcement through CAA procedures, rather than \n     through recourse to the Executive Branch.\n\n\n          subpart b--veterans' preference--general provisions\n\n       1.105  Responsibility for administration of veterans' \n     preference. This section clarifies that employing offices \n     have responsibility for administering veterans' preference, \n     within the parameters of the VEOA and these regulations.\n       1.106  Procedures for bringing claims under the VEOA. This \n     section establishes the procedures for contesting an adverse \n     determination.\n\n\n            subpart c--veterans' preference in appointments\n\n       1.107  Veterans' preference in appointments to restricted \n     covered positions. The VEOA makes 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3310 \n     applicable to the Legislative Branch, thereby extending an \n     absolute preference to veterans who apply for the positions \n     of guard, elevator operator, messenger and custodian. Despite \n     concerns raised by certain employing offices regarding the \n     singling out of these particular positions, the Board may not \n     ignore the statutory requirement that veterans who apply for \n     them be afforded an absolute preference over non-veteran \n     applicants.\n       We have based our definitions of the restricted position \n     terms ``guards,'' ``elevator operators,'' ``custodians,'' and \n     ``messengers,'' upon the definitions employed in the \n     veterans'' preference context by the U.S. Office of Personnel \n     Management in its ``Delegated Examining Operations \n     Handbook.'' See http://www.opm.gov/deu/Handbook_2003. The \n     definitions of custodian and messenger have been modified to \n     include a ``primary duty'' requirement, to allow the \n     performance of some custodial or messenger duties in \n     positions having other primary duties without transforming \n     those positions into restricted positions.\n       1.108  Veterans' preference in appointments to non-\n     restricted covered positions. This section clarifies that \n     preference eligible status is an affirmative factor in the \n     hiring process for covered positions. The requirement that \n     preference eligible status be applied as an ``affirmative \n     factor'' is derived from the directive of the VEOA that the \n     underlying principles of the veterans' preference laws be \n     applied within the Legislative Branch.\n       Where an employing office assigns points to applicants \n     competing for appointment to a covered position, it should \n     add commensurate points for veterans' preference eligible \n     applicants consistent with 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3309, one of the \n     sections made applicable to the Legislative Branch by the \n     VEOA. Should the office choose not to conduct formal \n     evaluations on a point scale, it must apply veterans' \n     preference as an affirmative factor, to a degree consistent \n     with the level of preference applied in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3309.\n       In no way does this require the creation of any particular \n     type of system of examining or evaluating applicants, and an \n     employing office may properly choose to not assign points at \n     all to applications for covered positions. Rather, this \n     regulation merely states that, whatever system the employing \n     office uses to choose among qualified applicants for a \n     covered position, it must accord a level of preference to \n     preference eligible qualified applicants consistent with the \n     point system indicated in the statute. Thus, the preference \n     must be comparable to affording an additional 5 or 10 points \n     (depending on the status of the preference eligible) on a 100 \n     point scale to qualified applicants, while understanding that \n     under such a point system the applicant must have attained at \n     least 70 points to be considered qualified. (OPM provides a \n     scale for converting other point scales (5 point, 10 point, \n     25 point, etc.) to a 100-point scale.)\n       Section  1.108 applies to both restricted and non-\n     restricted positions. While restricted positions are limited \n     to preference eligibles (should there be preference eligible \n     applicants), in the event that more than one preference \n     eligible applies, the employing office should apply the \n     requirement in this section to provide a higher preference to \n     a disabled preference eligible. Thus, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3310, \n     while restricting certain positions to preference eligibles \n     (so long as preference eligibles are available), does not \n     except these positions from this requirement in 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3309 to provide higher preference to a disabled \n     preference eligible applicant.\n       1.109  Crediting experience in appointments to covered \n     positions. This language is taken from 5 CFR Sec. 337.101(c), \n     which interprets 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3311, one of the sections made \n     applicable to the Legislative Branch by the VEOA. We have \n     elected to use the regulatory language as it is more clearly \n     written, and serves to better guide employing offices than \n     does the direct statutory text. The statutory and regulatory \n     provisions are laid out below for an easy comparison:\n\n\n  sec. 3311. preference eligibles; examinations; crediting experience\n\n       In examinations for the competitive service in which \n     experience is an element of qualification, a preference \n     eligible is entitled to credit--\n       (1) for service in the armed forces when his employment in \n     a similar vocation to that for which examined was interrupted \n     by the service; and\n       (2) for all experience material to the position for which \n     examined, including experience gained in religious, civic, \n     welfare, service, and organizational activities, regardless \n     of whether he received pay therefor.\n\n\n                           5 u.s.c. Sec. 3311\n\n       (c) When experience is a factor in determining eligibility, \n     OPM shall credit a preference eligible with:\n       (1) Time spent in the military service (i) as an extension \n     of time spent in the position in which he was employed \n     immediately before his entrance into the military service, or \n     (ii) on the basis of actual duties performed in\n\n[[Page S1491]]\n\n     the military service, or (iii) as a combination of both \n     methods. OPM shall credit time spent in the military service \n     according to the method that will be of most benefit to the \n     preference eligible.\n       (2) All valuable experience, including experience gained in \n     religious, civic, welfare, service, and organizational \n     activities, regardless of whether pay was received therefor.\n       5 CFR Sec. 337.101(c). Section 1.109 does not require an \n     employing office to consider experience as an element of \n     qualification, but only requires that preference eligibles be \n     afforded credit for certain experience if the employing \n     office chooses to do so. Also, section 1.109 does not \n     preclude an employing office from granting credit for \n     experience to non-preference eligibles, so long as the credit \n     afforded preference eligibles complies with the VEOA. Note \n     also that section 1.109 of these proposed regulations applies \n     equally to restricted and non-restricted positions.\n       Section 1.110  Waiver of physical requirements in \n     appointments to covered positions. This section contains \n     language derived directly from 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3312, one of the \n     sections made applicable to the Legislative Branch by the \n     VEOA. It requires an employing office to waive physical \n     requirements for a position if it determines, after \n     considering any recommendations of an accredited physician \n     that may be submitted by such an applicant, that he or she is \n     physically able to perform efficiently the duties of the \n     position. Note that OPM has chosen to promulgate regulations \n     interpreting 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3312 which make clear that: \n     ``[A]gencies must waive a medical standard or physical \n     requirement established under this part when there is \n     sufficient evidence that an applicant or employee, with or \n     without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential \n     duties of the position without endangering the health and \n     safety of the individual or others.''\n       5 CFR 339.204. The Board does not believe that these \n     proposed regulations are the proper vehicle for issuing \n     regulations concerning the Americans with Disabilities Act \n     (``ADA,'' 42 U.S.C. Sec. 12101 et seq.) as applied by section \n     102(a)(3) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1302(a)(3). Therefore, \n     section 1.110(a)(2) tracks the statutory language rather than \n     the OPM regulation. It also clarifies that the employing \n     office need consider a recommendation of an accredited \n     physician only if such a recommendation is submitted by the \n     preference eligible.\n       The Board does note, however, that Congress passed the ADA \n     subsequent to the veterans' preference protections contained \n     in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3312, and that, under the ADA as applied by \n     the CAA, employing offices may have obligations towards \n     applicants that may in some circumstances be greater than the \n     protections accorded preference eligible applicants in 5 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 3312. For example, these regulations do not \n     relieve employing offices from complying with the \n     restrictions imposed on disability-based inquiries under the \n     ADA but, as is discussed in the comments to section 1.118, \n     recognize that an employing office may use information \n     obtained through voluntary self-identification of one's \n     disabled status. Accordingly, the Board has made clear in \n     section 1.110 that nothing in this section shall relieve an \n     employing office of any greater obligation it may have \n     pursuant to the ADA.\n\n\n         subpart d--veteran's preference in reductions in force\n\n       1.111  Definitions applicable in reductions in force. This \n     section provides definitions of several terms used in the \n     regulations applying veterans' preference principles in the \n     context of reductions in force. Unless clearly stated \n     otherwise, the general definitions in proposed regulation \n     1.102 continue to apply in the context of reductions in \n     force. For example, as used in the proposed reduction in \n     force regulations, the term ``covered employee'' excludes \n     employees whose appointment is made by a Member of Congress \n     or by a committee or subcommittee of either House of Congress \n     or a joint committee of the House of Representatives and the \n     Senate and other employees excluded under the proposed \n     regulation 1.202(f). The term ``reduction in force'' has been \n     defined to encompass actions that result in termination of \n     employment, reductions in grade or demotions expected to \n     continue for more than 30 days. This definition derives from \n     OPM regulations, which clearly interpret 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3502 \n     to include demotions and include the requirement that the \n     personnel action be for more than 30 days [5 CFR Sec. 351.201 \n     (a)(2)], and from the statutory provisions of the VEOA that \n     charge the Board to follow OPM's regulations except where the \n     Board may determine that a modification of those regulations \n     would be more effective for the implementation of the rights \n     and protections under the VEOA. Caselaw interpreting the \n     veterans' preference laws also indicates that the inclusion \n     of demotions in what constitutes a reduction in force stems \n     from statutory, not just regulatory, language. (See, e.g., \n     AFGE Local 1904 v. Resor, 442 F. 2d 993, 994 (3rd Cir. 1971); \n     Alder v. U.S., 129 Ct. Cl. 150 (1954).)\n       5 U.S.C. Sec. 3501, which has been included in the CAA \n     through Section (c)(2) of the VEOA, contains special \n     definitions for determining whether an employee is a \n     ``preference eligible'' for purposes of applying veterans' \n     preference in reductions in force. The definitions that \n     appear in section 1.111(b) of the regulations are taken \n     directly from the statutory language in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3501. \n     Note, however, that these definitions do not apply to the \n     application of the provisions of 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3504 (and \n     section 1.114 of these regulations) regarding the waiver of \n     physical requirements in determining qualifications for \n     retention. In that context, the definition of ``preference \n     eligible'' set forth in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 2108 (and section \n     1.102(o) of the Board's regulations) shall apply.\n       As discussed below, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3502(c) provides that \n     preference eligibles are entitled to retention over other \n     ``competing employees''. In the Executive Branch, the \n     question of who are ``competing employees'' is answered by \n     reference to detailed and rather complex retention registers \n     that Executive Branch agencies are required to maintain. \n     (See, e.g., 5 CFR Sec. 351.203, 5 CFR Sec. 351.404 and 5 CFR \n     Sec. 351.501.) The Comments to our initial proposed \n     regulations noted that few if any employing offices in the \n     Legislative Branch maintain retention registers, and that \n     many of the OPM regulations regarding retention registers \n     rely on personnel practices and systems that do not exist in \n     the Legislative Branch.\n       In keeping with our new approach to the implementation of \n     the VEOA, these regulations do not impose a requirement that \n     an employing office create or maintain OPM-like retention \n     registers but instead provide a framework for determining \n     groups of ``competing employees'' for purposes of applying \n     retention preferences as mandated by 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3502(c). \n     In this respect, the Board has determined that several of the \n     terms in the OPM regulations may be used to implement the \n     concept of ``competing employees'' in the Legislative Branch \n     without imposing Executive Branch personnel practices or \n     systems: generally, ``competing covered employees'' are the \n     covered employees within a particular ``position \n     classification or job classification,'' at or within a \n     particular ``competitive area''.\n       The definition of ``position classification or job \n     classification'' is derived from OPM's basic definition of \n     ``competitive level'' in 5 CFR Sec. 351.403(a)(1). The \n     remaining regulations in 5 CFR Sec. 351.403(a)(2)-(4), \n     (b)(1)-(5) and (c)(1)-(4) prescribe the manner in which an \n     Executive Branch agency may determine a covered employee's \n     competitive level. While some of these rules could be adopted \n     in the Legislative Branch, others are clearly inapplicable. \n     The Board has decided not to adopt these portions of the OPM \n     regulations in order to provide employing offices with a \n     great amount of flexibility in determining an employee's \n     ``position classification or job classification''. This is in \n     keeping with our understanding that the personnel systems \n     used by employing offices within the Legislative Branch vary \n     significantly from those used in the Executive Branch. This \n     flexibility is, of course, subject to the understanding that \n     such determinations may not be manipulated in order to avoid \n     the employing office's obligations under the VEOA.\n       The definition of ``competitive area'' more closely tracks \n     OPM's definition of the same term in 5 CFR Sec. 351.402. We \n     note that the OPM regulations define ``competitive area'' in \n     terms of an agency's ``organizational units'' and \n     ``geographical locations''. The Board is not adopting OPM \n     definitions or descriptions of these terms, but will allow \n     employing offices flexibility in applying these concepts to \n     their own organizational structure. The Board has retained \n     the OPM requirement that the minimum competitive area be a \n     department or subdivision ``under separate administration''. \n     In this respect, ``separate administration'' is not \n     considered to require that the administration of a proposed \n     competitive area has final authority to hire and fire but \n     that it has the authority to administer the day to day \n     operations of the department or subdivision in question.\n       The OPM regulations incorporate the term ``tenure'' in \n     their definition of ``competitive group.'' We have used the \n     term in our definition of ``position classification or job \n     classification'' because the statutory language in 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3502 identifies ``tenure'' as a factor that will \n     override veterans' preference in determining employee \n     retention in a reduction in force. However, we have not \n     adopted OPM's definition of tenure, as it is tied to \n     Executive Branch service classifications that do not exist in \n     the Legislative Branch. See 5 CFR 351.501. Instead, the use \n     of the term ``tenure'' in these definitions refers only to \n     the type of appointment. For example, an employing office may \n     choose to make ``tenure'' distinctions between permanent and \n     temporary employees, probationary and non-probationary \n     employees, etc. By referring to ``permanent'' positions, we \n     are referring to jobs that are not limited in advance to a \n     specific temporal duration. Nothing in these Comments and \n     Regulations is intended to address the ``at-will'' status of \n     any covered position.\n       The Chief Counsel for the Senate noted, in her Comments to \n     the prior proposed regulations, that the Senate does not \n     employ the concept of ``tenure''. If an employing office \n     chooses not to make such distinctions, nothing in these \n     regulations requires it to do so. If the office does, that is \n     one of the factors in the constitution of the ``position \n     classifications or job classifications''. Again, the Board \n     notes that an employing office should not manipulate the \n     creation of tenure so as to avoid its obligations under the \n     VEOA.\n       We have also included a definition of ``undue \n     interruption'' that is taken directly from the definition of \n     the same term in the OPM regulations, 5 CFR Sec. 351.203. The \n     term is used in determining whether various jobs should be \n     included within the same ``position classification'' or ``job \n     classification,'' and is\n\n[[Page S1492]]\n\n     meant to strike a balance between the interests of employing \n     offices in retaining employees who will be able to perform \n     the jobs remaining after a reduction in force, and the \n     interests of preference eligibles whose jobs are being \n     eliminated in remaining employed. OPM struck this balance by \n     generally suggesting that an employee should be able to \n     perform or ``complete'' required work within 90 days of being \n     placed in the position, and the Board considers this time \n     period to be appropriate in the Legislative Branch as well. \n     For example, this protection against ``undue interruption'' \n     would apply if a preference eligible would have to complete a \n     training program of more than 90 days in order to safely and \n     efficiently perform the covered position to which he or she \n     would otherwise be transferred as a result of a RIF. Finally, \n     we note that, since ``undue interruption'' is an affirmative \n     defense, an employing office has the burden of raising it and \n     proving that an employee may not perform work without ``undue \n     interruption'' by objectively quantifiable evidence.\n       1.112 Application of reductions in force to veterans' \n     preference eligibles. The crux of this regulation derives \n     from 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3502(c), which provides:\n\n     An employee who is entitled to retention preference and whose \n     performance has not been rated unacceptable under a \n     performance appraisal system implemented under chapter 43 of \n     this title is entitled to be retained in preference to other \n     competing employees. (Emphasis added.)\n\n       This provision is the statutory lynchpin underlying \n     veterans' preferences in RIF's. The statutory language in \n     section 3502(c) above in effect requires the employing office \n     to terminate covered employees subject to a RIF in inverse \n     order of their veterans' preference status, within the \n     appropriate group of covered employees with similar jobs, so \n     long as the employees' performance has not been rated \n     unacceptable. Under section 3502(c), a preference eligible \n     covered employee (without an unacceptable performance \n     appraisal) must be retained in preference to non-preference \n     eligibles--even if the other covered employees in the group \n     in fact have greater length of service or more favorable \n     performance evaluations.\n       A separate provision in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3502(a) requires \n     Executive Branch agencies to give ``due effect'' to four \n     factors: tenure, veterans'' preference, length of service, \n     and performance or efficiency evaluations. OPM has \n     promulgated regulations addressing these four factors, but \n     which also incorporate the concept that, within the group of \n     employees competing for retention, appropriate veteran's \n     preference status is a factor that may override other factors \n     such as length of service and performance or efficiency \n     evaluations. (``Tenure,'' as discussed below, is factored in \n     to the group of employees within which employees compete for \n     retention during a RIF.)\n       Case law has also made abundantly clear that section \n     3502(c) requires that this preference eligible status \n     ``trumps'' the ``due effect'' given to length of service and \n     performance. Courts have interpreted the separate requirement \n     under section 3502(a) to give ``due effect'' to these four \n     enumerated factors as being relevant to retention \n     determinations between two preference eligibles, or between \n     two non-preference eligibles--and not relevant to retention \n     determinations between a preference eligible and a non-\n     preference eligible. Hilton v. Sullivan, 334 U.S. 323, 335, \n     336 (1948). The Board has chosen not to explicitly require \n     that length of service or performance or efficiency \n     evaluations be taken into account during RIF's--only that, if \n     they are, veterans' preference remains the controlling factor \n     in making retention decisions within ``position or job \n     classifications'' in a competitive area (assuming other \n     appropriate requirements are also met).\n       Federal courts have interpreted the present statutory \n     language of section 3502(c) as providing preference eligible \n     employees with an ``absolute preference,'' although only \n     within the confines of their competing group. Dodd v. TWA, \n     770 F. 2d 1038, 1041 (Fed. Cir. 1985); see also McKee v. TWA, \n     1999 LEXIS 25663 at *5 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (unpublished). \n     Additionally, the source of this key language in \n     Sec. 3502(c), the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944 (in turn \n     deriving from a series of historical statutes and executive \n     orders, commencing in 1865), and the legislative history of \n     this Act indicate that the section 3502(c) predecessor \n     language was considered the ``heart of the section''. Hilton \n     v. Sullivan, 334 U.S. 323, 338 (1948). To this effect, courts \n     have interpreted Sec. 3502(c) (or its predecessor under the \n     Veterans' Preference Act of 1944) as overriding such factors \n     as length of service when considering retention standing. \n     Hilton v. Sullivan, 334 U.S. at 335, 336, 339 (noting that \n     ``Congress passed the bill with full knowledge that the long \n     standing absolute retention preference of veterans would be \n     embodied in the Act;'' Elder v. Brannan, 341 U.S. 277, 285 \n     (1951). Thus, courts have interpreted section 3502(c) as \n     requiring preference to be given to a minimally qualified \n     preference eligible, within his or her competing group, \n     regardless of the preference eligible's length of service or \n     performance in comparison to non-preference eligibles.\n       To follow this clear statutory directive, the Board has \n     decided that veterans' preference shall be the \n     ``controlling'' factor (provided that the covered employee's \n     performance was not rated unacceptable), in an employment \n     decision taken within ``position or job classifications'' in \n     ``competitive areas,'' as discussed in the Comments to \n     section 1.111 of these proposed regulations, regardless of \n     such factors as length of service or performance or \n     efficiency ratings. Restricting the veterans' preference to \n     RIF's taken within ``position or job classifications'' in \n     ``competitive areas'' provides important limitations on the \n     scope of the preference accorded. As noted above, the \n     preference eligible does not normally compete for retention \n     against all covered employees of an employing office; the \n     definitional terms in section 1.111 restrict the scope of \n     competition only to covered employees in similar occupational \n     groupings (with the further qualification that the preference \n     eligible must perform the position in question without \n     ``undue interruption''(see discussion regarding section 1.111 \n     of these proposed regulations)); in certain facilities \n     involved; and with similar ``tenure,'' or employment status \n     (such as, for example, whether the employee is a permanent or \n     probationary employee). Note that OPM regulations incorporate \n     the concept of ``tenure'' into the definition of ``competing \n     group''; covered employees only compete for retention against \n     co-workers of the same tenure type. As noted in the Comments \n     to section 1.111 of these proposed regulations, employing \n     offices may or may not incorporate the concept of ``tenure,'' \n     and may choose not to make such distinctions as permanent, \n     temporary, or probationary employees. Nothing in these \n     proposed regulations requires employing offices to adopt such \n     distinctions.\n       Another qualification on the veterans' preference as a \n     ``controlling factor'' is that the preference eligible \n     employee's performance must not have been rated \n     ``unacceptable.'' While 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3502(c) contains a \n     reference to performance appraisal systems implemented under \n     5 U.S.C. Sec. 4301 et seq., we are not requiring employing \n     offices to implement a performance appraisal system following \n     5 U.S.C. Sec. 4301 et seq. An employing office may continue \n     to use its own methods for evaluating covered employees and \n     appraising performance, and need not adopt any formal policy \n     regarding performance appraisal. However, the Board notes \n     that employing offices should not manipulate performance \n     appraisals or evaluations so as to avoid obligations under \n     the VEOA.\n       Another significant qualification on this regulation is \n     that it only governs retention decisions in so far as they \n     affect preference eligible covered employees. In no way does \n     it govern decisions that do not affect preference eligible \n     covered employees; in such cases, an employing office is free \n     to make whatever determinations it so chooses, provided that \n     these determinations are consistent with any other applicable \n     law, and are not used to avoid responsibilities imposed by \n     the VEOA. (Of course, an employing office with covered \n     employees must disseminate information regarding its VEOA \n     policy to covered employees, so as to allow for self-\n     identification of preference eligibles. Furthermore, the \n     notice required by section 1.120 of these regulations will \n     allow covered employees who have not been identified as \n     preference eligibles to assert that status before the RIF \n     becomes effective.) Nor does the regulation require the \n     keeping of formal retention registers, as OPM (and these \n     regulations, as initially proposed) generally requires. \n     However, an employing office must preserve any records kept \n     or made regarding these retention decisions, as detailed in \n     Subpart E of these proposed regulations.\n       Note also that the Board has included the provision that a \n     preference eligible covered employee who is a ``disabled \n     veteran'' under section 1.102(h) above, who has a compensable \n     service-connected disability of 30 percent or more, and whose \n     performance has not been rated unacceptable by an employing \n     office is entitled to be retained in preference to other \n     preference eligibles. This provision derives from 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3502(b), which provides a higher level of preference to \n     certain disabled preference eligibles with regard to other \n     preference eligibles.\n       Finally, the Board notes that this section does not relieve \n     an employing office of any greater obligation it may be \n     subject to pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining \n     Notification Act (29 U.S.C. Sec. 2101 et seq.) as applied by \n     section 102(a)(9) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1302(a)(9), which \n     would of course apply to all employees covered by the CAA, \n     not only to preference eligible employees covered by the \n     VEOA.\n       1.113  Crediting experience in reductions in force. This \n     section closely follows 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3502(a), one of the \n     sections made applicable to the Legislative Branch by the \n     VEOA, requiring the employing office to provide preference \n     eligible covered employees with credit for certain specified \n     forms of prior service as the office calculates ``length of \n     service'' in the context of a RIF. This provision in no way \n     requires an employing office to utilize ``length of service'' \n     as a factor in its retention decisions regarding employees in \n     the event that the RIF decision does not impact any \n     preference eligible covered employees.\n       1.114  Waiver of physical requirements--retention. This \n     provision closely follows 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3504, one of the \n     sections made applicable to the Legislative Branch by the \n     VEOA, requiring that, when making decisions regarding \n     employee retention during a RIF, an employing office must \n     waive physical requirements for a job for preference \n     eligibles in certain specified circumstances. As discussed in \n     the Comments to section 1.110, nothing in this regulation \n     relieves an employing office of any greater obligation it may \n     have pursuant to the Americans with\n\n[[Page S1493]]\n\n     Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 12101 et seq.) as applied by \n     section 102(a)(3) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1302(a)(3).\n       1.116  Transfer of functions. The language in this section \n     derives from 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3503, one of the sections made \n     applicable to the Legislative Branch by the VEOA, requiring \n     covered employees to be transferred to another employing \n     office in the event of a transfer of functions from one \n     employing office to the other, or in the event of the \n     replacement of one employing office by another employing \n     office. The Board expects that employing offices shall \n     coordinate any such transfers in a way that respects both the \n     requirements of this regulation and, to the greatest extent \n     possible, the employing offices' own personnel systems and \n     policies. This section is one of the rare instances where an \n     employing office must follow the regulation even in the event \n     that the personnel action taken does not involve any \n     preference eligible covered employees; however, the clear \n     statutory language of 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3503 requires such a \n     result.\n       Employees and employing offices are reminded that the \n     definition of ``covered employee'' in these proposed \n     regulations does not include employees appointed by a Member \n     of Congress, a committee or subcommittee of either House of \n     Congress, or a joint committee of the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate. See proposed regulation \n     1.102(f)(bb). Therefore, proposed regulation 1.116 will not \n     apply to any such employees affected by the election of new \n     Members of Congress or the transfer of jurisdiction from one \n     committee to another.\n\n\n subpart e: adoption of veterans' preference policies, recordkeeping & \n                       informational requirements\n\n       We note that, of the six sections in this Subpart, only \n     section 1.120 derives directly from statutory language. The \n     other sections are borrowed from various other employment \n     statutes, and are promulgated pursuant to the authority \n     granted the Board by section 4(c)(4)(A) of the VEOA because \n     they are considered necessary to the implementation of the \n     VEOA. For example, the informational regulations in sections \n     1.120 and 1.121 are derived from informational regulations \n     promulgated under the Family and Medical Leave Act, which \n     provides employers with some flexibility in determining how \n     the FMLA will be implemented within their own workforce. The \n     Board is strongly committed to transparency as a policy \n     matter. Moreover, for the VEOA rights to become meaningful, \n     applicants for covered positions and covered employees will \n     have to participate in ensuring that this system works \n     properly, since employing offices are permitted to have \n     flexibility in determining their policies, and the Board will \n     not be taking the same active role in policing the veterans' \n     preference requirements that OPM takes in the Executive \n     Branch.\n       We also note that while this approach differs from OPM's, \n     it reflects the far greater flexibility that employing \n     offices have to tailor substantive requirements to their \n     existing personnel systems and imposes less burdensome \n     obligations on employing offices than that which is imposed \n     on executive agencies: under our regulatory approach, \n     employing offices will have reduced procedural burdens in \n     that they will not be subject to the more detailed \n     requirements of keeping formal retention registers, to the \n     more highly regulated requirements regarding employee access \n     to files (see e.g., 5 CFR Sec. 293.101 et seq., 5 CFR \n     Sec. 297.101 et seq., and 5 CFR Sec. 351.505(b)), or to \n     examining or evaluating applicants on a 100-point scale, \n     seeking prior OPM approval of RIF's, etc.\n       Section 1.116 Adoption of veterans' preference policy. As \n     noted at the outset of these Comments, the regulations will \n     require each employing office that employs one or more \n     covered employees or seeks applicants for covered positions \n     to develop, within 120 days of the Congressional approval of \n     the regulations, a written program or policy setting forth \n     that employing office's methods for implementing the VEOA's \n     veterans' preference principles in the employing office's \n     hiring and retention systems. Employing offices that have no \n     employees covered by the VEOA are not required to adopt such \n     a policy or program.\n       Because these regulations afford the employing offices a \n     great amount of flexibility in determining how to implement \n     veterans' preference within their own personnel systems, it \n     is imperative that the methods chosen by the employing \n     offices be reduced to writing and disseminated to covered \n     applicants and employees. This will further the goals of \n     accountability and transparency, as well as consistency in \n     the application of the employing office's veterans' \n     preference procedures. An existing policy may be amended or \n     replaced by the employing office from time to time, as it \n     deems necessary or appropriate to meet changing personnel \n     practices and needs. We note, however, that the employing \n     office's policy or program will at all times remain subject \n     to the requirements of the VEOA and these regulations. \n     Accordingly, while the adoption of a policy or program will \n     demonstrate the employing office's efforts to comply with the \n     VEOA, it will not relieve an employing office of substantive \n     compliance with the VEOA.\n       Sections 1.117 Preservation of records kept or made. The \n     requirements set forth in this section are derived from OPM \n     regulations regarding retention of RIF records, 5 CFR \n     Sec. 351.505, and EEOC regulations regarding the preservation \n     of personnel and employment records kept or made by \n     employers, 29 CFR Sec. 1602.14. This section requires that \n     relevant records be retained for one year from the date of \n     the making of the record or the date of the personnel action \n     involved or, if later, one year from the date on which the \n     applicant or employee is notified of the personnel action. In \n     addition, where a claim has been brought under section 401 of \n     the CAA against an employing office under the VEOA, the \n     respondent employing office must preserve all personnel \n     records relevant to the claim until final disposition of the \n     claim.\n       Section 1.118 Dissemination of veterans' preference \n     policies to applicants for covered positions. Section 1.118 \n     requires that employing offices must furnish information to \n     applicants for covered positions before appointment decisions \n     are made. Before these decisions are made, it is important \n     that applicants be given the opportunity to self-identify \n     themselves as preference eligibles, and that they receive \n     information regarding the employing office's policies and \n     procedures for implementing the VEOA, in order to ensure that \n     they are aware of the VEOA obligations that may apply to \n     their situation. Accordingly, the regulations require that \n     information regarding the employing office's policies and \n     procedures for implementing the VEOA in appointments be \n     furnished to applicants at various stages when the employing \n     office is hiring into covered positions. We note that \n     inviting applicants to voluntarily self-identify as a \n     disabled veteran for purposes of the application of an \n     employing office's veterans' preference policies, as outlined \n     in the proposed regulation, is consistent with the EEOC's ADA \n     Enforcement Guidance: Preemployment Disability-Related \n     Questions and Medical Examinations (EEOC Oct. 10, 1995).\n       This requirement does not prevent an employing office from \n     appropriately modifying its veterans' preference policies \n     when it sees fit to do so, but is intended to ensure that \n     applicants will be made aware of the employing office's then-\n     current policies and procedures. The requirement that an \n     employing office allow applicants a ``reasonable time'' to \n     provide information regarding their veterans' preference \n     status is intentionally flexible. If an employing office must \n     fill a covered position within a matter of days, one working \n     day may be a ``reasonable time'' for submission of the \n     information. However, if the employing office's appointment \n     process is more prolonged, more time should be allowed.\n       Sections 1.119 and 1.120 Dissemination of information of \n     veterans' preference policies to covered employees, and \n     notice requirements applicable in RIFs. It is also important \n     that covered employees receive information regarding the \n     employing office's policies and procedures for implementing \n     the VEOA in connection with RIFs, in order to ensure that \n     they are aware of the VEOA obligations that may apply to that \n     situation. Accordingly, section 1.119 requires that \n     information regarding the employing office's policies and \n     procedures for implementing the VEOA in appointments be \n     disseminated through employee handbooks, if the employing \n     office has covered employees and ordinarily distributes such \n     handbooks to those employees, or through any other written \n     policy or manual that the employing office may distribute to \n     covered employees concerning their employee rights or \n     reductions in force.\n       The notice requirements attendant to a RIF are set out \n     separately in section 1.120 of the regulations. These \n     regulations derive from the express statutory language in 5 \n     USC Sec. 3502(d) and (e), which have been applied to the \n     Legislative Branch by the VEOA. The language of section \n     3502(d) and (e) has been modified in section 1.120 to be \n     consistent with the terms and approach used in the rest of \n     these regulations. Among other changes, section 1.120 refers \n     to ``covered employees'' and the provision in 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3502(e) that the ``President'' may shorten the 60 day \n     advance notice period to 30 days has been changed to the \n     ``director of the employing agency.'' Additionally, the \n     provision regarding Job Training Partnership Act notice has \n     been omitted. The requirement to inform the employee of the \n     place where he or she may inspect regulations and records \n     pertaining to this case derives from 5 CFR \n     Sec. 351.802(a)(3).\n       The statutory language requiring notice of ``the employee's \n     ranking relative to other competing employees, and how that \n     ranking was determined'' has been modified to require that \n     the notice state whether the covered employee is preference \n     eligible and that the notice separately state the ``retention \n     status'' (i.e., whether the employee will be retained or not) \n     and preference eligibility of the other covered employees in \n     the same job or position classification within the covered \n     employee's competitive area. The Board is not requiring the \n     keeping of retention registers or the ranking of employees \n     within a job or position classification affected by a RIF. \n     However, the statutory language clearly compels employing \n     offices to provide employees who will be adversely affected \n     by a reduction in force with advance notice of how and why \n     the agency decided to subject that particular employee to the \n     reduction in force. At a minimum, this includes whether the \n     affected employee has preference eligible status, and an \n     objective indication why the employee was not retained in \n     relation to other employees in the affected position \n     classifications or job classifications.\n       Section 1.121 Informational requirements regarding \n     veterans' preference determinations. Once an appointment or \n     reduction in force decision has been made, it is important \n     that applicants for covered positions and\n\n[[Page S1494]]\n\n     covered employees receive information regarding the employing \n     office's decision, in order to ensure that the rights and \n     obligations created by the VEOA may be effectively enforced \n     under the CAA as contemplated by section 4(c)(3)(B) of the \n     VEOA. Accordingly, section 1.121 of the regulations requires \n     that certain limited information regarding the employing \n     office's decision be made available to applicants for covered \n     positions and to covered employees, upon request.\n\n                    Proposed Substantive Regulations\n\n       PART 1--Extension of Rights and Protections Relating to \n     Veterans' Preference Under Title 5, United States Code, to \n     Covered Employees of the Legislative Branch (section 4(c) of \n     the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998)\n\n\n    subpart a--matters of general applicability to all regulations \n                promulgated under section 4 of the veoa\n\n     Sec.\n     1.101  Purpose and scope.\n     1.102  Definitions.\n     1.103  Adoption of regulations.\n     1.105  Coordination with section 225 of the Congressional \n         Accountability Act.\n\n\n                      sec. 1.101 purpose and scope\n\n       (a) Section 4(c) of the VEOA. The Veterans Employment \n     Opportunities Act (VEOA) applies the rights and protections \n     of sections 2108, 3309 through 3312, and subchapter I of \n     chapter 35 of title 5 U.S.C., to certain covered employees \n     within the Legislative Branch.\n       (b) Purpose and scope of regulations. The regulations set \n     forth herein are the substantive regulations that the Board \n     of Directors of the Office of Compliance has promulgated \n     pursuant to section 4(c)(4) of the VEOA, in accordance with \n     the rulemaking procedure set forth in section 304 of the CAA \n     (2 U.S.C. Sec. 1384). The purpose of subparts B, C and D of \n     these regulations is to define veterans' preference and the \n     administration of veterans' preference as applicable to \n     Federal employment in the Legislative Branch. (5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2108, as applied by the VEOA). The purpose of subpart E \n     of these regulations is to ensure that the principles of the \n     veterans' preference laws are integrated into the existing \n     employment and retention policies and processes of those \n     employing offices with employees covered by the VEOA, and to \n     provide for transparency in the application of veterans' \n     preference in covered appointment and retention decisions. \n     Provided, nothing in these regulations shall be construed so \n     as to require an employing office to reduce any existing \n     veterans' preference rights and protections that it may \n     afford to preference eligible individuals.\n\n\n                         sec. 1.102 definitions\n\n       Except as otherwise provided in these regulations, as used \n     in these regulations:\n       (a) Act or CAA means the Congressional Accountability Act \n     of 1995, as amended (Pub.

The term \n     covered employee includes an applicant for employment in a \n     covered position and a former covered employee.\n       (g) Covered position means any position that is or will be \n     held by a covered employee.\n       (h) Disabled veteran means a person who was separated under \n     honorable conditions from active duty in the armed forces \n     performed at any time and who has established the present \n     existence of a service-connected disability or is receiving \n     compensation, disability retirement benefits, or pensions \n     because of a public statute administered by the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs or a military department.\n       (i) Employee of the Office of the Architect of the Capitol \n     includes any employee of the Office of the Architect of the \n     Capitol, the Botanic Gardens, or the Senate Restaurants.\n       (j) Employee of the Capitol Police Board includes any \n     member or officer of the Capitol police.\n       (k) Employee of the House of Representatives includes an \n     individual occupying a position the pay of which is disbursed \n     by the Clerk of the House of Representatives, or another \n     official designated by the House of Representatives, or any \n     employment position in an entity that is paid with funds \n     derived from the clerk-hire allowance of the House of \n     Representatives but not any such individual employed by any \n     entity listed in subparagraphs (3) through (8) of paragraph \n     (f) above nor any individual described in subparagraphs (aa) \n     through (cc) of paragraph (f) above.\n       (l) Employee of the Senate includes any employee whose pay \n     is disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate, but not any such \n     individual employed by any entity listed in subparagraphs (3) \n     through (8) of paragraph (f) above nor any individual \n     described in subparagraphs (aa) through (cc) of paragraph (f) \n     above.\n       (m) Employing office means: (1) the personal office of a \n     Member of the House of Representatives or of a Senator; (2) a \n     committee of the House of Representatives or the Senate or a \n     joint committee; (3) any other office headed by a person with \n     the final authority to appoint, hire, discharge, and set the \n     terms, conditions, or privileges of the employment of an \n     employee of the House of Representatives or the Senate; or \n     (4) the Capitol Guide Board, the Congressional Budget Office, \n     the Office of the Architect of the Capitol, the Office of the \n     Attending Physician, and the Office of Compliance.\n       (n) Office means the Office of Compliance.\n       (o) Preference eligible means veterans, spouses, widows, \n     widowers or mothers who meet the definition of ``preference \n     eligible'' in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 2108(3)(A)-(G).\n       (p) Qualified applicant means an applicant for a covered \n     position whom an employing office deems to satisfy the \n     requisite minimum job-related requirements of the position. \n     Where the employing office uses an entrance examination or \n     evaluation for a covered position that is numerically scored, \n     the term ``qualified applicant'' shall mean that the \n     applicant has received a passing score on the examination or \n     evaluation.\n       (q) Separated under honorable conditions means either an \n     honorable or a general discharge from the armed forces.

L. 105-339, 112 Stat. 3182).\n       (t) Veteran means persons as defined in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 2108, \n     or any superseding legislation.\n\n\n                   sec. 1.103 adoption of regulations\n\n       (a) Adoption of regulations. Section 4(c)(4)(A) of the VEOA \n     generally authorizes the Board to issue regulations to \n     implement section 4(c). In addition, section 4(c)(4)(B) of \n     the VEOA directs the Board to promulgate regulations that are \n     ``the same as the most relevant substantive regulations \n     (applicable with respect to the Executive Branch) promulgated \n     to implement the statutory provisions referred to in \n     paragraph (3)'' of section 4(c) of the VEOA. Those statutory \n     provisions are section 2108, sections 3309 through 3312, and \n     subchapter I of chapter 35, of title 5, United States Code. \n     The regulations issued by the Board herein are on all matters \n     for which section 4(c)(4)(B) of the VEOA requires a \n     regulation to be issued. Specifically, it is the Board's \n     considered judgment based on the information available to it \n     at the time of promulgation of these regulations, that, with \n     the exception of the regulations adopted and set forth \n     herein, there are no other ``substantive regulations \n     (applicable with respect to the Executive Branch) promulgated \n     to implement the statutory provisions referred to in \n     paragraph (3)'' of section 4(c) of the VEOA that need be \n     adopted.\n       (b) Modification of substantive regulations. As a \n     qualification to the statutory obligation to issue \n     regulations that are ``the same as the most substantive \n     regulations (applicable with respect to the Executive \n     Branch),'' section 4(c)(4)(B) of the VEOA authorizes the \n     Board to ``determine, for good cause shown and stated \n     together with the regulation, that a modification of such \n     regulations would be more effective for the implementation of \n     the rights and protections under'' section 4(c) of the VEOA.\n       (c) Rationale for Departure from the Most Relevant \n     Executive Branch Regulations. The Board concludes that it \n     must promulgate regulations accommodating the human resource \n     systems existing in the Legislative Branch; and that such \n     regulations must take into account the fact that the Board \n     does not possess the statutory and Executive Order based \n     government-wide policy making authority underlying OPM's \n     counterpart VEOA regulations governing the Executive Branch. \n     OPM's regulations are designed for the competitive service \n     (defined in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 2102(a)(2)), which does not exist \n     in the employing offices subject to this regulation. \n     Therefore, to follow the OPM regulations would create \n     detailed and complex rules and procedures for a workforce \n     that does not exist in the Legislative Branch, while \n     providing no VEOA protections to the covered Legislative \n     Branch employees. We have chosen to propose specially \n     tailored regulations, rather than simply to adopt those \n     promulgated by OPM, so that we may effectuate Congress' \n     intent in extending the principles of the veterans' \n     preference laws to the Legislative Branch through the VEOA.\n\n\n     sec. 1.104 coordination with section 225 of the congressional \n                           accountability act\n\n       Statutory directive. Section 4(c)(4)(D) of the VEOA \n     requires that promulgated regulations must be consistent with \n     section 225 of\n\n[[Page S1495]]\n\n     the CAA. Among the relevant provisions of section 225 are \n     subsection (f)(1), which prescribes as a rule of construction \n     that definitions and exemptions in the laws made applicable \n     by the CAA shall apply under the CAA, and subsection (f)(3), \n     which states that the CAA shall not be considered to \n     authorize enforcement of the CAA by the Executive Branch.\n\n\n          subpart b--veterans' preference--general provisions\n\n     Sec.\n     1.105 Responsibility for administration of veterans' \n         preference.\n     1.106 Procedures for bringing claims under the VEOA.\n\n\n  sec. 1.105 responsibility for administration of veterans' preference\n\n       Subject to Section 1.106, employing offices are responsible \n     for making all veterans' preference determinations, \n     consistent with the VEOA.\n\n\n        sec. 1.106 procedures for bringing claims under the veoa\n\n       Applicants for appointment to a covered position and \n     covered employees may contest adverse veterans' preference \n     determinations, including any determination that a preference \n     eligible is not a qualified applicant, pursuant to sections \n     401-416 of the CAA, 2 U.S.C.

The term guard does not include law \n     enforcement officer positions of the U.S. Capitol Police \n     Board.\n       Messenger--One whose primary duty is the supervision or \n     performance of general messenger work (such as running \n     errands, delivering messages, and answering call bells).\n\n\n   sec. 1.108 veterans' preference in appointments to non-restricted \n                           covered positions\n\n       (a) Where employing offices opt to examine and rate \n     applicants for covered positions on a numerical basis they \n     shall add points to the earned ratings of those preference \n     eligibles who receive passing scores in an entrance \n     examination, in a manner that is proportionately comparable \n     to the points prescribed in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3309.\n       (b) In all other situations involving appointment to a \n     covered position, employing offices shall consider veterans' \n     preference eligibility as an affirmative factor that is given \n     weight in a manner that is proportionately comparable to the \n     points prescribed in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3309 in the employing \n     office's determination of who will be appointed from among \n     qualified applicants.\n\n\n  sec. 1.109 crediting experience in appointments to covered positions\n\n       When considering applicants for covered positions in which \n     experience is an element of qualification, employing offices \n     shall provide preference eligibles with credit:\n       (a) for time spent in the military service (1) as an \n     extension of time spent in the position in which the \n     applicant was employed immediately before his/her entrance \n     into the military service, or (2) on the basis of actual \n     duties performed in the military service, or (3) as a \n     combination of both methods.

Sec. 2108(3)(c) who has a compensable service-\n     connected disability of 30 percent or more is not able to \n     fulfill the physical requirements of the covered position, \n     the employing office shall notify the preference eligible of \n     the reasons for the determination and of the right to respond \n     and to submit additional information to the employing office, \n     within 15 days of the date of the notification. Should the \n     preference eligible make a timely response the employing \n     office, at the highest level within the employing office, \n     shall render a final determination of the physical ability of \n     the preference eligible to perform the duties of the \n     position, taking into account the response and any additional \n     information provided by the preference eligible. When the \n     employing office has completed its review of the proposed \n     disqualification on the basis of physical disability, it \n     shall send its findings to the preference eligible.\n       (c) Nothing in this section shall relieve an employing \n     office of any greater obligation it may have pursuant to the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 12101 et \n     seq.) as applied by section 102(a)(3) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1302(a)(3).\n\n\n         subpart d--veteran's preference in reductions in force\n\n     Sec.\n     1.111  Definitions applicable in reductions in force.\n     1.112  Application of preference in reductions in force.\n     1.113  Crediting experience in reductions in force.\n     1.114  Waiver of physical requirements in reductions in \n         force.\n     1.115  Transfer of functions.\n\n\n        sec. 1.111 definitions applicable in reductions in force\n\n       (a) Competing covered employees are the covered employees \n     within a particular position or job classification, at or \n     within a particular competitive area, as those terms are \n     defined below.\n       (b) Competitive area is that portion of the employing \n     office's organizational structure, as determined by the \n     employing office, in which covered employees compete for \n     retention. A competitive area must be defined solely in terms \n     of the employing office's organizational unit(s) and \n     geographical location, and it must include all employees \n     within the competitive area so defined. A competitive area \n     may consist of all or part of an employing office. The \n     minimum competitive area is a department or subdivision of \n     the employing office under separate administration within the \n     local commuting area.\n       (c) Position classifications or job classifications are \n     determined by the employing office, and shall refer to all \n     covered positions within a competitive area that are in the \n     same grade, occupational level or classification, and which \n     are similar enough in duties, qualification requirements, pay \n     schedules, tenure (type of appointment) and working \n     conditions so that an employing office may reassign the \n     incumbent of one position to any of the other positions in \n     the position classification without undue interruption.\n       (d) Preference Eligibles. For the purpose of applying \n     veterans' preference in reductions in force, except with \n     respect to the application of section 1.114 of these \n     regulations regarding the waiver of physical requirements, \n     the following shall apply:\n       (1) ``active service'' has the meaning given it by section \n     101 of title 37;\n       (2) ``a retired member of a uniformed service'' means a \n     member or former member of a uniformed service who is \n     entitled, under statute, to retired, retirement, or retainer \n     pay on account of his/her service as such a member; and\n       (3) a preference eligible covered employee who is a retired \n     member of a uniformed service is considered a preference \n     eligible only if--\n       (A) his/her retirement was based on disability--\n       (i) resulting from injury or disease received in line of \n     duty as a direct result of armed conflict; or\n\n[[Page S1496]]\n\n       (ii) caused by an instrumentality of war and incurred in \n     the line of duty during a period of war as defined by \n     sections 101 and 1101 of title 38;\n       (B) his/her service does not include twenty or more years \n     of full-time active service, regardless of when performed but \n     not including periods of active duty for training; or\n       (C) on November 30, 1964, he/she was employed in a position \n     to which this subchapter applies and thereafter he/she \n     continued to be so employed without a break in service of \n     more than 30 days.\n       The definition of ``preference eligible'' as set forth in 5 \n     U.S.C Sec. 2108 and section 1.102(o) of these regulations \n     shall apply to waivers of physical requirements in \n     determining an employee's qualifications for retention under \n     section 1.114 of these regulations.\n       (e) Reduction in force is any termination of a covered \n     employee's employment or the reduction in pay and/or position \n     grade of a covered employee for more than 30 days and that \n     may be required for budgetary or workload reasons, changes \n     resulting from reorganization, or the need to make room for \n     an employee with reemployment or restoration rights. This \n     does not encompass terminations or other personnel actions \n     predicated upon performance, conduct or other grounds \n     attributable to an employee.\n       (f) Undue interruption is a degree of interruption that \n     would prevent the completion of required work by a covered \n     employee 90 days after the employee has been placed in a \n     different position under this part. The 90-day standard \n     should be considered within the allowable limits of time and \n     quality, taking into account the pressures of priorities, \n     deadlines, and other demands. However, a work program would \n     generally not be unduly interrupted even if a covered \n     employee needed more than 90 days after the reduction in \n     force to perform the optimum quality or quantity of work. The \n     90-day standard may be extended if placement is made under \n     this part to a program accorded low priority by the employing \n     office, or to a vacant position. An employing office has the \n     burden of proving ``undue interruption'' by objectively \n     quantifiable evidence.\n\n\n      sec. 1.112 application of preference in reductions in force\n\n       Prior to carrying out a reduction in force that will affect \n     covered employees, employing offices shall determine which, \n     if any, covered employees within a particular group of \n     competing covered employees are entitled to veterans' \n     preference eligibility status in accordance with these \n     regulations. In determining which covered employees will be \n     retained, employing offices will treat veterans' preference \n     as the controlling factor in retention decisions among such \n     competing covered employees, regardless of length of service \n     or performance, provided that the preference eligible \n     employee's performance has not been rated unacceptable. \n     Provided, a preference eligible who is a ``disabled veteran'' \n     under section 1.102(h) above who has a compensable service-\n     connected disability of 30 percent or more and whose \n     performance has not been rated unacceptable by an employing \n     office is entitled to be retained in preference to other \n     preference eligibles. Provided, this section does not relieve \n     an employing office of any greater obligation it may be \n     subject to pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining \n     Notification Act (29 U.S.C. Sec. 2101 et seq.) as applied by \n     section 102(a)(9) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec.  1302(a)(9).\n\n\n         sec. 1.113 crediting experience in reductions in force\n\n       In computing length of service in connection with a \n     reduction in force, the employing office shall provide credit \n     to preference eligible covered employees as follows:\n       (a) a preference eligible covered employee who is not a \n     retired member of a uniformed service is entitled to credit \n     for the total length of time in active service in the armed \n     forces;\n       (b) a preference eligible covered employee who is a retired \n     member of a uniformed service is entitled to credit for:\n       (1) the length of time in active service in the armed \n     forces during a war, or in a campaign or expedition for which \n     a campaign badge has been authorized; or\n       (2) the total length of time in active service in the armed \n     forces if he is included under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3501(a)(3)(A), \n     (B), or (C); and\n       (c) a preference eligible covered employee is entitled to \n     credit for:\n       (1) service rendered as an employee of a county committee \n     established pursuant to section 8(b) of the Soil Conservation \n     and Allotment Act or of a committee or association of \n     producers described in section 10(b) of the Agricultural \n     Adjustment Act; and\n       (2) service rendered as an employee described in 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2105(c) if such employee moves or has moved, on or after \n     January 1, 1966, without a break in service of more than 3 \n     days, from a position in a nonappropriated fund \n     instrumentality of the Department of Defense or the Coast \n     Guard to a position in the Department of Defense or the Coast \n     Guard, respectively, that is not described in 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2105(c).\n\n\n   sec. 1.114 waiver of physical requirements in reductions in force\n\n       (a) If an employing office determines, on the basis of \n     evidence before it, that a covered employee is preference \n     eligible, the employing office shall waive:\n       (1) requirements as to age, height, and weight, unless the \n     requirement is essential to the performance of the duties of \n     the position; and\n       (2) physical requirements if, in the opinion of the \n     employing office, on the basis of evidence before it, \n     including any recommendation of an accredited physician \n     submitted by the preference eligible, the preference eligible \n     is physically able to perform efficiently the duties of the \n     position.\n       (b) If an employing office determines that, on the basis of \n     evidence before it, a preference eligible described in 5 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 2108(3)(c) who has a compensable service-\n     connected disability of 30 percent or more is not able to \n     fulfill the physical requirements of the covered position, \n     the employing office shall notify the preference eligible of \n     the reasons for the determination and of the right to respond \n     and to submit additional information to the employing office \n     within 15 days of the date of the notification. Should the \n     preference eligible make a timely response the employing \n     office, at the highest level within the employing office, \n     shall render a final determination of the physical ability of \n     the preference eligible to perform the duties of the covered \n     position, taking into account the evidence before it, \n     including the response and any additional information \n     provided by the preference eligible. When the employing \n     office has completed its review of the proposed \n     disqualification on the basis of physical disability, it \n     shall send its findings to the preference eligible.\n       (c) Nothing in this section shall relieve an employing \n     office of any greater obligation it may have pursuant to the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 12101 et \n     seq.) as applied by section 102(a)(3) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1302(a)(3).\n\n\n                    sec. 1.115 transfer of functions\n\n       (a) When a function is transferred from one employing \n     office to another employing office, each covered employee in \n     the affected position classifications or job classifications \n     in the function that is to be transferred shall be \n     transferred to the receiving employing office for employment \n     in a covered position for which he/she is qualified before \n     the receiving employing office may make an appointment from \n     another source to that position.\n       (b) When one employing office is replaced by another \n     employing office, each covered employee in the affected \n     position classifications or job classifications in the \n     employing office to be replaced shall be transferred to the \n     replacing employing office for employment in a covered \n     position for which he/she is qualified before the replacing \n     employing office may make an appointment from another source \n     to that position.\n\n\n subpart e--adoption of veterans' preference policies, recordkeeping & \n                       informational requirements\n\n     Sec.\n     1.116  Adoption of veterans' preference policy.\n     1.117  Preservation of records made or kept.\n     1.118  Dissemination of veterans' preference policies to \n         applicants for covered positions.\n     1.119  Dissemination of veterans' preference policies to \n         covered employees.\n     1.120  Written notice prior to a reduction in force.\n     1.121  Informational requirements regarding veterans' \n         preference determinations.\n\n\n           sec. 1.116 adoption of veterans' preference policy\n\n       No later than 120 calendar days following Congressional \n     approval of this regulation, each employing office that \n     employs one or more covered employees or that seeks \n     applicants for a covered position shall adopt its written \n     policy specifying how it has integrated the veterans' \n     preference requirements of the Veterans Employment \n     Opportunities Act of 1998 and these regulations into its \n     employment and retention processes. Upon timely request and \n     the demonstration of good cause, the Executive Director, in \n     his/her discretion, may grant such an employing office \n     additional time for preparing its policy. Each such employing \n     office will make its policies available to applicants for \n     appointment to a covered position and to covered employees in \n     accordance with these regulations and to the public upon \n     request. The act of adopting a veterans' preference policy \n     shall not relieve any employing office of any other \n     responsibility or requirement of the Veterans Employment \n     Opportunity Act of 1998 or these regulations. An employing \n     office may amend or replace its veterans' preference policies \n     as it deems necessary or appropriate, so long as the \n     resulting policies are consistent with the VEOA and these \n     regulations.\n\n\n            sec. 1.117 preservation of records made or kept\n\n       An employing office that employs one or more covered \n     employees or that seeks applicants for a covered position \n     shall maintain any records relating to the application of its \n     veterans' preference policy to applicants for covered \n     positions and to workforce adjustment decisions affecting \n     covered employees for a period of at least one year from the \n     date of the making of the record or the date of the personnel \n     action involved or, if later, one year from the date on which \n     the applicant or covered employee is notified of the \n     personnel action. Where a claim has been brought under \n     section 401 of the CAA against an employing office under the \n     VEOA, the respondent employing office shall preserve all \n     personnel records relevant to the claim until final \n     disposition of the claim. The term ``personnel records \n     relevant to the claim,'' for example, would include records \n     relating to the veterans' preference determination regarding \n     the person bringing the claim and\n\n[[Page S1497]]\n\n     records relating to any veterans' preference determinations \n     regarding other applicants for the covered position the \n     person sought, or records relating to the veterans' \n     preference determinations regarding other covered employees \n     in the person's position or job classification. The date of \n     final disposition of the charge or the action means the \n     latest of the date of expiration of the statutory period \n     within which the aggrieved person may file a complaint with \n     the Office or in a U.S. District Court or, where an action is \n     brought against an employing office by the aggrieved person, \n     the date on which such litigation is terminated.\n\n\n1.118 dissemination of veterans' preference policies to applicants for \n                           covered positions\n\n       (a) An employing office shall state in any announcements \n     and advertisements it makes concerning vacancies in covered \n     positions that the staffing action is governed by the VEOA.\n       (b) An employing office shall invite applicants for a \n     covered position to identify themselves as veterans' \n     preference eligibles, provided that in doing so:\n       (1) the employing office shall state clearly on any written \n     application or questionnaire used for this purpose or make \n     clear orally, if a written application or questionnaire is \n     not used, that the requested information is intended for use \n     solely in connection with the employing office's obligations \n     and efforts to provide veterans' preference to preference \n     eligibles in accordance with the VEOA; and\n       (2) the employing office shall state clearly that disabled \n     veteran status is requested on a voluntary basis, that it \n     will be kept confidential in accordance with the Americans \n     with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C.

Mr. President, I set aside a few moments today to reflect \non the life of Marine LCpl Richard Chad Clifton. Chad epitomized the \nbest of our country' s brave men and women who fought to free Iraq and \nto secure a new democracy in the Middle East. He exhibited unwavering \ncourage, dutiful service to his country, and above all else, honor. In \nthe way he lived his life, and how we remember him, Chad reminds each \nof us how good we can be.\n  A resident of Milton, Chad's passing has deeply affected the \ncommunity. A 2003 graduate of Cape Henlopen High School. Chad was the \nson of Richard C. and Terri Clifton. Friends, family, and school \nofficials recalled Chad Clifton as smart, funny, laid back, and \ncarefree; an all-around good person. He viewed the Marine Corps as an \nopportunity to gain life experience. An aspiring writer, Chad said \nbeing overseas was providing a reservoir of experiences to write about.\n\n[[Page S1498]]\n\n  Chad always had a strong interest in the military. He spent more than \n3 years as a member of the Cape Henlopen High School Junior ROTC \nprogram. His participation in that program enabled me to meet him last \nyear and talk about his interest in serving the United States of \nAmerica. His interest also came from his grandfather, a Korean War \nveteran, who earned the Purple Heart. That medal will be buried with \nRichard Chad Clifton.\n  After graduating from high school, Chad underwent basic training at \nParris Island, SC before being stationed at Camp Pendleton, CA. Chad \nbecame a member of the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment. He died in \ncombat in the Al Anbar province in western Iraq.\n  Chad was a remarkable and well-respected young soldier. His friends \nand family remember him as an officer and gentleman with an acid wit \nand an appreciation for music and art. He enjoyed writing, listening to \nheavy metal, and watching television sitcom reruns. As his mother \nremembers, ``He was pure potential with a good heart.''\n  Today, commemorate Chad, celebrate his life, and offer his family our \nsupport and our deepest sympathy on their tragic loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/16/senate-section/article/S1498-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   KYOTO PROTOCOL AND CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge that the \ninternational global warming pact known as the Kyoto Protocol has \nentered into force. This happens only 7 years after it was negotiated.\n  The Protocol imposes limits on emissions of greenhouse gases that \nscientists blame for increasing world temperatures. As my colleagues \nknow, President Bush decided to abandon the Protocol and any serious \ninternational negotiations on the matter in March 2001. That unilateral \nabandonment leaves the world to wonder why the Nation that contributes \nthe most greenhouse gas emissions to the world atmosphere refuses to \naccept responsibility for these emissions and refuses to cooperate with \nthe international community to curb the global warming threat.\n  I assume it was no coincidence that the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works, on which I serve as ranking member, was supposed to \nconsider legislation today called the Clear Skies Act. If passed, this \nlegislation will create anything but clear skies.\n  The bill rolls back steady progress under the Clean Air Act and \nactually would increase this country's greenhouse gas emissions more \nthan no legislation. The chairman of the committee has decided to take \nmore time to craft this measure, due in no small part to the fact that \nthe bill lacks the support in committee to be approved and reported to \nthe Senate today. I commend the chairman for making that decision \ntoday--the same day the Kyoto Protocol has taken effect--to more \ncarefully consider this important measure.\n  In the coming weeks as we discuss this legislation, I hope that we \ncan reach agreement on a bill that truly does clear our skies. To me, \nthat means a bill that not only improves upon the Clean Air Act, but \nthat also addresses our Nation's greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Yesterday, on the eve of the Kyoto Protocol entering into force, a \nWhite House spokesman stated that the United States has made an \nunprecedented commitment to reduce the growth of greenhouse gas \nemissions in a way that continues to grow our economy. Mr. President, I \nhave seen no evidence of this commitment.\n  For my part, I have already introduced the Clean Power Act of 2005. I \nalso intend to introduce the Renewable Portfolio Standard Act of 2005 \nand the Electric Reliability Security Act of 2005, two bills designed \nto use our resources more efficiently.\n  If President Bush signed into law a measure that caps or truly \nrequired reductions in the emissions of greenhouse gases, evidence of a \nreal commitment would be apparent, not just to me but to the entire \nworld. I call upon my Senate and House colleagues to mark the occasion \nof the Kyoto Protocol's entering into force by embarking upon serious \nwork to craft legislation that imposes credible deadlines to achieve \ncaps and significant reductions to our Nation's sizeable and growing \ncontribution of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/16/senate-section/article/S1498-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1498-S1499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   THE DOHA DECLARATION AND THE TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY ACT OF 2002\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 \ngives the President and the U.S. Trade Representative the power to \nnegotiate bilateral and multilateral trade agreements that must be \ngiven expedited consideration by Congress. The Doha Declaration was \nadopted by the World Trade Organization at the Fourth Ministerial \nConference at Doha, Qatar, on November 14, 2001, and addresses the need \nfor access to medicines for all and how to reconcile that need with \nintellectual property protections.\n  When the Trade Act came to the floor of the Senate, Senator Feinstein \nand I offered an amendment to the section on the negotiating objectives \nof the United States in trade negotiations. Our amendment made it a \nprincipal objective of the United States to respect the Doha \nDeclaration in all trade negotiations. Regrettably, in several trade \nagreements since then, administration has refused to fulfill this \nobligation.\n  The basic issue was the interpretation of the so-called TRIPS \nagreement on intellectual property protections such as patents and \ncopyright. The Doha Declaration specifically states that the TRIPS \nagreement ``does not and should not prevent members from taking \nmeasures to protect public health.'' It recognized the need to \ninterpret and implement TRIPS in a way that supports a nation's ``right \nto protect public health and, in particular, to promote access to \nmedicines for all.''\n  The Doha Declaration went on to specify that ``[e]ach member country \nhas the right to grant compulsory licenses and the freedom to determine \nthe grounds upon which such licenses are granted.'' It stated that each \nmember nation is ``free to establish its own regime'' on whether a sale \nof a patented product by the patent owner or licensee exhausts the \npatent, so that it cannot be asserted against subsequent purchasers or \nusers of the product.\n  The Doha Declaration recognized a basic principle--poor people in the \ndeveloping nations often cannot afford many patented drugs, even though \nthe drugs are their only hope for surviving AIDS and other serious and \nlife-threatening diseases.\n  The Doha Declaration is clearly intended to prevent patents from \nblocking access to life-saving drugs. Developing nations obviously do \nnot have the capacity to manufacture drugs themselves, and they must be \nfree to purchase these drugs from another country.\n  Our amendment to the Trade Promotion Authority Act reinforces the \nDoha Declaration. The Bush administration should be using it to \nnegotiate trade agreements that allow urgently needed access to \nmedicines. Instead, the administration has used trade agreements to \npromote the interests of the pharmaceutical industry at the expense of \naccess to drugs in developing nations.\n  Again and again, the administration has defied the Doha Declaration \nand imposed unjustified restrictions on the availability of patented \ndrugs. They've done it on trade agreements with Australia, with Jordan, \nwith Morocco, with Singapore, and other nations. In these agreements, \nthe Bush administration has undermined the very core of the Doha \nDeclaration. They're trying to do it now in the Central American Free \nTrade Agreement.\n  They block the approval and use of generic version of drugs. They \nprevent new treatments for HIV/AIDS from getting to the people of the \ndeveloping world.\n  It's an outrageous policy. The administration has made it U.S. policy \nto block affordable, life-saving drugs for AIDS for the people of \nCentral America, because they feel it's more important to protect the \nprofits of brand name drug companies..\n  The administration is defying the statutory requirement of the Doha \nDeclaration, that our objective in these agreements must be to \nguarantee access to essential drugs for the sick and the poor in the \ndeveloping nations of the world.\n  They use countless legal tactics to cause delays in the approval of \ngeneric drugs in developing countries, even\n\n[[Page S1499]]\n\nwhen patents are invalid or are not infringed at all by the generic \ndrug. In essence, the administration has set up a bottleneck to prevent \napproval of generic drugs in many countries of the developing world. \nThat's completely at odds with the Doha Declaration.\n  U.S. law allows a generic drug company to use a patented drug to \ndevelop a generic version of the drug before the patent has expired. It \ntakes time to develop a drug, test it, and have it reviewed by the FDA.\n  The theory of the law is that a generic drug company should be able \nto complete this approval process before the patent expires, so that \ndeveloping countries can get generic versions of drugs as quickly as \npossible.\n\n  That process is permitted by TRIPS, which means it is permitted by \nthe trade agreements the administration has negotiated. It is not \nrequired by those agreements, however, and the administration has not \ntried to include it. In fact, they give brand name drug companies the \nopportunity to block that process in each of these developing \ncountries. It's another example of the administration cynically \nprotecting the interests of the brand name drug companies in violation \nof the law.\n  The administration claims that its tactics are consistent with \nanother objective of the Trade Act, which is to seek standards for \nintellectual property protection and enforcement in other countries. \nThat's true, but it's in the same provision in the act as the Doha \nDeclaration.\n  The administration has a good track record in protecting the brand \nname drug industry, but it has never gotten even one provision that \nrespects the Doha Declaration. Selectively interpreting laws to apply \none provision and ignore another is unacceptable.\n  It's no secret that the brand name drug companies want better patents \nand longer exclusivities in the United States. But it's wrong for the \nadministration to side with them in trade agreements that defy the Doha \nDeclaration.\n  The administration has systematically blocked Congress from changing \nintellectual property protections except in ways that benefit brand \nname drug companies. It gets even worse. When brand name drug companies \nsuccessfully lobby for protections under the laws of our trading \npartners that are greater than those under U.S. law, the industry then \nargues that the United States should ``harmonize'' its intellectual \nproperty protections with those of our trading partners. That's a slap \nin the face to Congress and the American people. They should not be \nforced by the Bush administration to endure even higher drug prices \nthan they do today.\n  The question is: What should be done to put real teeth in Doha \nDeclaration in trade negotiations?\n  First, the administration should follow U.S. law and respect the \ndeclaration in future negotiations, such as those about to begin with \nthe nations of the Andes. It should immediately stop seeking \nintellectual property protections that prevent access to medicines for \nall and should start to seek those that promote greater access to \nmedicines for all.\n  Second, the negotiators for countries of the developed and developing \nworld should stop every time the U.S. Trade Representative asks for an \nintellectual property provision, especially one directed specifically \nat drug patents or drug data exclusivity, and ask how that provision \naffects access to needed drugs.\n  The U.S. Trade Representative should not be surprised if negotiators \nfrom developing nations refuse to accept restrictive provisions that \nviolate the Doha Declaration. They should challenge our Trade \nRepresentative to obey the rule of law.\n  And here in Congress, we have to do a better job of insisting that \nour trade agreements comply with the letter and the spirit of the Doha \nDeclaration. It's the law of the land, and it's a matter of life and \ndeath for hundreds of millions of people in other lands. The tactics we \nare so shamefully using against them can only breed greater resentment \nand greater hatred of the United States. And we can't afford to let \nthat happen at this critical time in our role in the world.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a brief description of provisions in \ntrade agreements that violate the Doha Declaration be printed in the \nRecord as a technical appendix.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Technical Appendix to Statement of Senator Edward M. Kennedy on the \n     Doha Declaration and the Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002\n\n\n                Compulsory Licensing and Parallel Trade\n\n       The Administration has successfully imposed restrictions on \n     the right to compulsory license medicines in the trade \n     agreements with Australia, Jordan, and Singapore. The \n     Administration has obtained provisions that can block \n     parallel imports in trade agreements with both developed and \n     developing nations, such as Australia, Morocco, and \n     Singapore. For the Doha Declaration to work, both developed \n     and developing countries must be able to issue compulsory \n     licenses and then engage in parallel importation of the drug \n     from the developed country that can manufacture the drug to \n     the developing country whose people need the drug, yet these \n     agreements undermine both compulsory licensing and parallel \n     importation.\n\n\n                           Data Exclusivities\n\n       The Administration has also pursued data exclusivities to \n     protect brand name drugs in trade agreements with Australia, \n     Bahrain, Chile, Jordan, Morocco, and Singapore, and now seeks \n     them in the Central American Free Trade Agreement. To receive \n     authorization to market a drug, many countries, like the \n     United States, require the drug manufacturer to present data \n     to show that the drug is safe and effective for its intended \n     use. The clinical trials to produce these data can be quite \n     expensive, and protecting these data for a period of years--\n     meaning that the data may not be used to approve another, \n     similar product--can create an incentive for and protect the \n     investment in producing them.\n       In the developing world, however, data exclusivities \n     prohibit a country from approving even a compulsory licensed \n     version of a patented drug. The trade agreements that require \n     exclusivities provide no mechanism to allow for distribution \n     of compulsory licensed products notwithstanding the \n     exclusivities. The exclusivities therefore will block \n     compulsory licensed versions of the new treatments for HIV/\n     AIDS and other serious diseases from getting to the people of \n     the developing world, at least until the data exclusivities \n     have expired.\n\n\n               Linkage between Patents and Drug Approval\n\n       Most recently, the Administration has also negotiated for \n     provisions in trade agreements with the countries of Central \n     America that link approval of generic drug products to the \n     status of patents on the pioneer drug product. In other \n     words, approval of generic drugs is blocked if there are \n     patents and the government approval agency has not \n     ascertained whether the generic product infringes a brand \n     name drug patent.\n       In the United States, approval of a generic drug is blocked \n     because of a patent only if the brand name company sues to \n     defend the patent. The obligation is not on the Food and Drug \n     Administration, which has repeatedly stated that it has no \n     capacity to assess or evaluate patents. The Administration's \n     trade agreements place the responsibility to defend brand \n     name drug patents on the FDA's of the developing nations, \n     which we can only assume are more overburdened than our own \n     FDA and similarly lack the expertise to assess and evaluate \n     patents. The inevitable result will be delays in the approval \n     of generic drugs in developing countries caused by patents \n     that are invalid or that are not infringed by the generic \n     drug.\n\n\n                          The Bolar Amendment\n\n       In the United States, the Bolar Amendment allows a generic \n     drug company to use a patented invention to develop a generic \n     version of a drug before the patent has expired because it \n     takes time to develop and test a drug and have it reviewed by \n     the FDA and a generic drug company should be able to complete \n     this process before the patent has expired.\n       Without a Bolar provision, a drug patent is arbitrarily \n     extended because of the time needed for drug formulation and \n     approval. The Bolar Amendment in a developing country will \n     improve timely access to medicines for the sick and poor. The \n     Administration has not sought to mandate the Bolar provision \n     in trade agreements, however.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/16/senate-section/article/S1499-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1499-S1500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Mr. President, I rise to reintroduce the Animal Fighting \nProhibition Enforcement Act, legislation that garnered the support of \n51 Senate cosponsors and 201 House cosponsors in the 108th Congress but \ndidn't quite make it over the finish line. I thank my colleagues for \ntheir support in this endeavor to protect the welfare of animals and \nexpress my hope that we will get the job done early in this session. \nThis legislation targets the troubling, widespread, and often \nunderground activities of dogfighting and cockfighting where dogs and \nbirds are bred and trained to fight to the death. This is done for the \nsheer enjoyment and illegal wagering of the animals' handlers and \nspectators.\n  These activities are reprehensible and despicable. Our States' laws \nreflect this sentiment. All 50 States have prohibited dogfighting. It \nis considered a felony in 48 States. Cockfighting is illegal in 48 \nStates, and it is a felony in 31 States. In my home State of Nevada, \nboth dogfighting and cockfighting are considered felonies. In fact, it \nis a felony to even attend a dogfighting or cockfighting match.\n  Unfortunately, in spite of public opposition to extreme animal \nsuffering, these animal fighting industries thrive. There are 11 \nunderground dogfighting publications and several above-ground \ncockfighting magazines. These national magazines advertise and sell \nanimals and the materials associated with animal fighting. They also \nseek to legitimize this shocking practice.\n  During the consideration of the farm bill in 2001, a provision was \nincluded that closed loopholes in the Federal animal fighting law. Both \nthe House and the Senate also increased the maximum jail time for \nindividuals who violate this law from 1 year to 2 years, making any \nviolation a Federal felony. However, during the conference, the jail \ntime increase was removed.\n  Then in 2003, I offered an amendment to the Healthy Forests bill that \nwould have had the same effect as the bill I am introducing today. The \nSenate agreed to this amendment by unanimous consent, but it was again \ntaken out in conference.\n  Now, I am hoping the third time is the charm. In the form that is \nbeing introduced today, this legislation passed the House Judiciary \nCommittee in September 2004. It is ripe for enactment early in the \n109th Congress. This legislation has been endorsed by the USDA, the \nAmerican Veterinary Medical Association, more than 150 State and local \npolice and sheriffs departments across the country, and a host of \nothers. The only groups opposing it are the cockfighters and the \ndogfighters.\n  The bill seeks to do two things. First, it increases the penalty to \nthe felony level--up to 2 years jail time for offenders. I am informed \nby U.S. attorneys that they are hesitant to pursue animal fighting \ncases with merely a misdemeanor penalty. The USDA has received \ninnumerable tips from informants and requests to assist with State and \nlocal prosecutions but has only been able to help in a handful of cases \nsince Congress first passed the Federal animal fighting law in 1976. \nFor example, in my own State last year, law enforcement authorities \nraided an ongoing cockfight involving about 200 people from Nevada and \nother States. The USDA wanted to pursue Federal charges, to complement \nthe local effort, but the U.S. Attorney's Office declined to prosecute \nbecause the Federal crime was only a misdemeanor. Increased penalties \nwill provide a greater incentive for Federal authorities to pursue \nanimal fighting cases.\n\n  Second, the bill prohibits the interstate shipment of cockfighting \nimplements, such as razor-sharp knives and gaffs. The specific knives \nare commonly known as ``slashers.'' The slashers and icepick-like gaffs \nare attached to the legs of birds to make the cockfights more violent \nand to induce bleeding of the animals. These weapons are used only in \ncockfights. Since Congress has restricted shipment of birds for \nfighting, it should also restrict implements designed specifically for \nfights.\n  This is commonsense, long-overdue legislation. It does not expand the \nFederal Government's reach into a new area but simply aims to make \ncurrent law more effective. It is explicitly limited to interstate and \nforeign commerce, so it protects States rights in the two States, \nLouisiana and New Mexico, where cockfighting is still allowed. Further, \nit protects States rights in the other 48 States where weak Federal law \nis compromising their ability to keep animal fighting outside their \nborders.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is needed for humane reasons. But it \nis also urgently needed to protect poultry health and public health. In \n2002 to 2003, we had an outbreak of exotic Newcastle disease among \npoultry in my home State of Nevada, as well as in California, Arizona, \nand Texas. According to the USDA, this deadly disease was spread in \nlarge part by illegal cockfighters. It cost taxpayers about $200 \nmillion to contain and cost the poultry industry many millions more in \nlost export markets. In Asia, at least four children died last year due \nto exposure to bird flu from cockfighting activity, according to news \nreports. One Malaysian news agency noted that surveys by the \n``Veterinary Department show that irresponsible cock-fighting \nenthusiasts are the main `culprits' for bringing the avian influenza \nvirus into the state.'' Fortunately, bird flu has not yet jumped the \nspecies barrier in this country, but we ought to do all we can to \nminimize the risk. One of the ways to ensure greater protection against \nthe spread of these dangerous avian diseases is to enforce the ban on \ninterstate and foreign shipment of birds for the purpose of fighting. \nOur bill ensures that penalties are in place to encourage meaningful \nenforcement of this ban.\n  I appreciate the strong support of Senators Specter, Cantwell, \nFeinstein, DeWine, Kennedy, Kyl, Kohl, Lugar, Vitter, Leahy, and \nSantorum in this effort and look forward to the overwhelming support of \nmy other colleagues in the Senate. I also wish to recognize \nRepresentative Mark Green for his leadership in reintroducing an \nidentical bill in the House today. Surely, this is an issue that must \nbe addressed as soon as possible. We cannot allow this barbaric \npractice to continue in our civilized society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/16/senate-section/article/S1500-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1500-S1502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            REDUCING CRIME AT AMERICA'S SEAPORTS ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, yesterday I introduced legislation to \nimprove our Nation's ability to use the criminal law to guard against \nand respond to terrorist attacks at our seaports--the Reducing Crime at \nAmerica's Seaports Act of 2005.\n  I am pleased to join my colleagues Senators Biden, Specter, Kyl, and \nAllen, who have co-sponsored this bill, in moving forward with this \ninitiative.\n  The Nation's seaports are a tremendous asset to our economy. They \nalso represent a significant vulnerability to a possible terrorist \nattack.\n  Much of our national commerce travels through these ports. Ninety \npercent of all cargo tonnage moves through the 50 biggest ports. Just \n25 of those ports account for 98 percent of the Nation's container \ntraffic--two of the largest such ports, Oakland and Los Angeles/Long \nBeach, are in my home State of California.\n  A modern port, which handles huge ships laden with thousands of \ncontainers, and vast amounts of critical bulk cargo, is complex and \nsprawling. It is also extremely vulnerable to a terrorist attack.\n  The very complexity and size of our ports make them an obvious and \nattractive target for a terrorist. With hundreds of miles of wharves \nand piers, a vast volume of boat, truck and car traffic, lengthy \nperimeters, ports can be the perfect target.\n  Not only are they vulnerable to attack, the consequences of even a \nsmall attack could be overwhelming. Commerce would be devastated, not \nonly at\n\n[[Page S1501]]\n\nand around the port, but all around the Nation, because the goods \nmoving through ports are the lifeblood of industry and commerce \nthroughout the Nation. The human cost would also be terrible, because \nports not only employ thousands of workers; they are without exception \nlocated near large metropolitan population centers.\n  My concern is not just theoretical. The available intelligence \nanalysis supports the conclusion that seaports are a critical \nvulnerability. Our terrorist enemies are well aware of the \nvulnerability of these ports, and are well equipped to do terrible \ndamage.\n  This problem is heightened by two critical factors: the first is the \ngrowing importance of containers in maritime commerce. Since their \nintroduction in the late 1960s, container traffic has grown. It now \naccounts for 66 percent of dollar value of all U.S. maritime traffic. \nIn some ports, such as Los Angeles/Long Beach, it constitutes most of \nthe trade. The problem with containers is that they are, by definition, \na potential delivery device for a terrorist weapon. Whether \nconventional explosives, biological agents, or a nuclear device, such \nas a so-called ``dirty bomb,'' containers complicate the problem of \nsecuring our ports. The second factor is the increasing possibility \nthat terrorists have, or will soon acquire, the ability to mount \nunconventional attacks, such as nuclear, radiological or biological \nattacks. In such a case our ports provide both a method for bringing \nsuch things into the country for an attack inland, and can be the \ntarget itself.\n  There is a lot to do to secure our ports. Some of it requires long \nterm investment in capital improvements. But we can accomplish much \nsimply by fine-tuning the tools we already have. Among those tools is \nthe criminal law. These laws are vital to those on the front line--the \nCoast Guard, the FBI, Customs Agents, and the State, local and private \nauthorities who protect our ports every day.\n  This bill will improve the criminal law applicable to ports in the \nfollowing ways: it would clarify that the law prohibiting fraudulent \naccess to transport facilities includes seaports and waterfronts within \nits scope, as well as increase the maximum term of imprisonment for a \nviolation from 5 years to 10 years. According to the Report of the \nInteragency Commission on Crime and Security at U.S. Seaports: \n``[c]ontrol of access to the seaport or sensitive areas within the \nseaports is often lacking.'' Such unauthorized access is especially \nproblematic, since inappropriate controls may result in the theft of \ncargo and, more dangerously, undetected admission of terrorists.\n\n  It would amend the U.S. Code to make it a crime: One, for a vessel \noperator knowingly to fail to slow or stop a ship once ordered to do so \nby a Federal law enforcement officer, including the Coast Guard; two, \nfor any person on board a vessel to impede boarding or other law \nenforcement action authorized by federal law; or three, for any person \non board a vessel to provide false information to a federal law \nenforcement officer. Any violation of this section would be punishable \nby a fine and/or imprisonment for a maximum term of 5 years. A core \nfunction of the Coast Guard is law enforcement at sea, especially in \nthe aftermath of the tragic events of September 11. While the Coast \nGuard has authority to use whatever force is reasonably necessary to \nforce a vessel to stop or be boarded, ``refusal to stop,'' by itself, \nis not currently a crime.\n  It creates a new criminal provision to make it a crime to willfully \nuse a dangerous weapon, including chemical, biological, radiological or \nnuclear materials, or explosive, with intent to cause death or serious \nbodily injury to any person on board a passenger vessel. Any violation \nof this section, including attempts and conspiracies, would be \npunishable by a fine and/or imprisonment for a maximum term of 20 years \nand, if death results, for a term of imprisonment up to life. This \nsection would close a potential gap in existing law by making it clear \nthat ``passenger vessels'' like cruise ships are included within the \nscope of transportation vehicles covered by the provision.\n  The bill would amend existing law which covers violence against \nmaritime navigation to make it a crime to intentionally damage or \ntamper with any maritime navigational aid maintained by the Coast Guard \nor under its authority, if such act endangers the safe navigation of a \nship. The Coast Guard maintains over 50,000 navigational aids on more \nthan 25,000 miles of waterways. These aids, which are relied upon by \nall commercial, military and recreational mariners, are essential for \nsafe navigation and are, therefore, inviting targets for terrorists.\n  The bill would make it a crime to: One, knowingly place in waters any \ndevice or substance which is likely to damage a vessel or its cargo, \ninterfere with a vessel's safe navigation, or interfere with maritime \ncommerce; or two, knowingly discharge a hazardous substance into U.S. \nwaters, with the intent to endanger human life or welfare. Any \nviolation of these provisions would be punishable by a fine and/or a \nterm of imprisonment up to life; if death results, the offense could be \npunishable by a sentence of death. This addresses the vulnerability of \nour shorelines and ports to such a terrorist attack the results could \nbe economically and environmentally devastating.\n  The law would make it a crime to knowingly and willfully transport \naboard any vessel an explosive, biological agent, chemical weapon, or \nradiological or nuclear materials, knowing that the item is intended to \nbe used to commit a terrorist act. Any violation of this \nprovision would be punishable by a fine and/or a term of imprisonment \nup to life; if death results, the offense could be punished by a \nsentence of death. It would also make it a crime to knowingly and \nwillfully transport aboard any vessel any person who intends to commit, \nor is avoiding apprehension after having committed, a terrorist act.\n\n  The law creates a set of crimes involving attacks on sea vessels. \nModeled upon the existing criminal sanctions for destruction or \ninterference with aircraft or aircraft facilities, updating them in the \nmaritime area to harmonize them with coverage in the aviation context. \nSpecifically, this section would make it a crime to: One, damage or \ndestroy a vessel or its parts, a maritime facility, or any apparatus \nused to store, load or unload cargo and passengers; two, perform an act \nof violence against or incapacitate any individual on a vessel or at or \nnear a facility; or three, knowingly communicate false information that \nendangers the safety of a vessel.\n  The law would also subject any individual who knowingly conveys false \ninformation about the offenses described above, or other named \noffenses, to a civil penalty up to $5,000. In addition, an individual \nwho willfully and maliciously or recklessly conveys false information \nwould be punishable by a fine and/or imprisonment for a maximum term of \n5 years.\n  The law would amend the U.S. Code to prohibit the carrying of a \ndangerous weapon, including a firearm or explosive, at a seaport or on \nboard a vessel. Any violation of this section, and conspiracies, would \nbe punishable by a fine and/or imprisonment for a maximum term of 10 \nyears; an individual who willfully or recklessly violates this section \nwould be punishable by a fine and/or imprisonment for a maximum term of \n15 years; if death results, the offense would be punishable by a term \nof imprisonment up to life. According to the Interagency Commission \nReport, ``[a]t many seaports, the carrying of firearms is not \nrestricted, and thus internal conspirators and other criminals are \nallowed armed access to cargo vessels and cruise line terminals.''\n  The bill expands the scope of section 659 of title 18, theft of \ninterstate or foreign shipments, to include theft of goods from \nadditional transportation facilities or instruments, including \ntrailers, cargo containers, and warehouses. In addition, it would \nincrease the maximum term of imprisonment for low-level thefts from 1 \nyear to 3 years and clarify that the determination of whether goods are \n``moving as an interstate or foreign shipment'' is made by considering \nthe entire cargo route, regardless of any temporary stop between the \npoint of origin and final destination.\n  In addition to making changes to the criminal law, the bill creates \nmechanisms to permit the government to efficiently acquire data \nnecessary to target scarce enforcement resources. Recognizing that \ncargo theft is not only a significant economic problem in its own \nright, but an indicator of porous\n\n[[Page S1502]]\n\nsecurity, and thus of terrorist vulnerability, the law creates \nmeaningful reporting requirements.\n  This bill would require the Attorney General to one, mandate the \nreporting of cargo theft offenses; and two, create a database \ncontaining the reported information, which would be appropriately \nintegrated with other agencies' information-collection efforts and made \navailable to governmental officials. Despite the fact that cargo theft \nis a well-known problem, there exists no national data collection and \nreporting systems that capture the magnitude of serious crime at \nseaports.\n  The bill increases the penalties for noncompliance with certain \nmanifest reporting and record-keeping requirements, including \ninformation regarding the content of cargo containers and the country \nfrom which the shipments originated. The effectiveness of Federal, \nState and local efforts to secure ports is compromised by criminals' \nability to evade detection by underreporting and misreporting the \ncontent of cargo--with little more than a slap on the wrist, if that. \nThe existing statutes simply do not provide adequate sanctions to deter \ncriminal or civil violations. As a consequence, vessel manifest \ninformation is often wrong or incomplete--and our ability to assess \nrisks, make decisions about which containers to inspect more closely, \nor simply control the movement of cargo is made virtually impossible.\n  Our Nation's ports represent a critical vulnerability point in our \nNation's defenses. It is critical that we take steps to reduce this \nvulnerability, develop defenses, and, unfortunately, plan for \nmitigation should there be an attack. There is much to do, including \nproviding additional funding. This bill addresses one aspect of the \nproblem by improving and adding to the criminal justice tools which can \nprotect our ports. It is a relatively narrow bill, with a precise focus \non the problem at hand.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in supporting this much-needed \nimprovement to our law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/16/senate-section/article/S1502-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MILK INCOME LOSS CONTRACT EXTENSION BILL\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN.

Mr. President, on February, 14, 2005, one of our greatest \nAmericans, Frederick Douglass, was honored at a celebration at the \nhistoric Ford's Theatre that was sponsored by the Caring Institute and \nthe National Park Service. These two organizations play major roles in \nensuring that the life and legacy of Mr. Douglass are not forgotten--\nthe Institute through its establishment of The Frederick Douglass \nMuseum and the Hall of Fame for Caring Americans on Capitol Hill, and \nthe National Park Service through its management of the Frederick \nDouglass National Historic Site at Cedar Hill in Anacostia. As you \nknow, Cedar Hill was his home in Washington, DC.\n  Frederick Douglass was one of the most important intellectual voices \nin American life in the 19th century. He was a forceful and persuasive \nwriter and orator against slavery and for equal rights for African-\nAmericans. His experiences as a slave were central to exposing the \ninjustices of slavery. His first autobiographical work, Narrative of \nthe Life of Frederick Douglass, was published in 1845 when he was a \nrunaway slave. His second autobiography, My Bondage and My Freedom, was \npublished in 1855, 9 years after friends and supporters in Great \nBritain bought his freedom. He frequently lectured about his \nexperiences as a slave, and on what freedom meant to him.\n  During the Civil War, Douglass served as a recruiter of African-\nAmerican soldiers for the North, and several times discussed with \nPresident Lincoln the problems of slavery. In the early 1870s, Douglass \nmoved from Rochester, NY, where he had established the antislavery \nnewspaper, the North Star, to Washington, DC, where he served as the \nDistrict's Marshal, 1877-1881, and Recorder of Deeds, 1881-1886. \nDouglass later served our Nation as Minister to Haiti, 1889-1891.\n  Even when he was serving in governmental capacities, Douglass \ncontinued to deliver speeches on the meaning of abolition and \nemancipation. Just as he fought for the rights of African-Americans, he \nalso worked to expand women's rights. On the day he died, February 20, \n1895, he had attended a women's suffrage meeting.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to \none of our greatest Americans, Frederick Douglass. He would have \ncelebrated his 187th birthday this month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/16/senate-section/article/S1502-3", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE LIFE OF PATRICK OKURA\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, Patrick Okura was an extraordinary man who \ncontributed much to our Nation, the Asian American community, and the \nfields of mental health and psychology. I was privileged to have him as \na great friend and mentor. During my life in the Nation's Capital, Pat \nwas always ready to help and advise me.\n  At Pat's memorial service on February 11, 2005, at Bradley Hills \nPresbyterian Church in Bethesda, MD, the Honorable Norman Y. Mineta, \nU.S. Secretary of Transportation, spoke of Pat and his remarkable life \nthat had an enormous and positive impact on many.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Secretary Mineta's remarks be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n       We are here today to celebrate the life of an extraordinary \n     man one of the great leaders of our community, of our great \n     nation, and a valued and trusted friend.\n       It is almost impossible to count the number of \n     contributions that Kiyoshi Patrick Okura made to all of us.\n       His national presidency of the Japanese American Citizens \n     League came during one of the most critical periods of the \n     civil rights movement, and his active involvement in the JACL \n     throughout its history helped win unprecedented victories for \n     our community.\n       His advocacy on behalf of mental health was a passion that \n     continued through his service as the staff psychologist for \n     Father Flanagan's Boy's Town, his work at the National \n     Institute of Mental Health, his founding of the National \n     Asian Pacific American Families Against Substance Abuse, and \n     the work that he and Lily have done together at the Okura \n     Mental Health Foundation.\n       But most important of all, Pat had a passion to help others \n     whether through his profession as a psychologist or through \n     his endless personal drive to develop leaders for our \n     community.\n       As a mentor, a friend, a guide and a counselor, he was \n     second to none.

Mr. President, I speak about some people who, through the \nway they lived their lives, have been very important, not only to me, \nbut to their entire community. I am talking about Stu and Bethel Dopf \nof Cambridge, ID.\n  Stu Dopf passed away in 2001, and just recently, on January 17, 2005, \nhe was joined in Heaven by his wife of 63 years. When I read of Mrs. \nDopf's passing, fond memories flooded my mind from my time growing up \nin Washington County, where Cambridge is located. I have only good \nthings to remember about Mr. and Mrs. Dopf and\n\n[[Page S1503]]\n\nthe family they raised from my very first experiences with them.\n  For more than 40 years, the Dopfs worked together to publish a small \nweekly newspaper known as the Upper Country News-Reporter. It was \nprinted on newsprint, but I have no doubt in my mind that this paper \nrepresented and still does the very fabric of that community. The paper \nplays that role because the Dopfs wanted it that way, and made sure it \nhappened.\n  I believe my first experience with Stu Dopf was almost 50 years ago \nat the Washington County Fair in Cambridge. I was in 4-H and had \nentered fat calves to be judged at the fair. Now, to some reporters or \nnewspaper editors, livestock judging at a county fair may not seem like \nmuch of an assignment. But Stu understood the community in which he \nlived, and the farm and ranch families that made it a closely-knit \ncommunity. People were interested in the activities and accomplishments \nof their neighbors, and no achievement was too small to report.\n  After that, any time I had some news or any stories about my 4-H or \nFFA activities, or public speaking contests, I knew I could stop by the \nNews-Reporter office, where the Dopfs would be certain to listen. More \noften than not, those stories would show up somewhere on the pages of \nthe next issue. Later, when I made my decision to run for office for \nthe first time, for a seat in the Idaho State Senate, I went to the \nDopfs to ask if they would print the pocket brochure for my campaign. \nTheir sons, Alan and Don, had just started a printing business the year \nbefore, so it was an easy choice for me to go there.\n  Throughout my life, whether in the activities of my younger days, my \nendeavors in the legislature, or my time in the U.S. House and Senate, \nStu Dopf always provided a fair, unbiased account in the News-Reporter. \nHe always gave me a fair opportunity to make my point. Continuing Stu's \nexample, the editors generously include each weekly column I write in \nthe paper, and I am truly grateful.\n  Even after they retired, the influence of Mr. and Mrs. Dopf remained \nat the News-Reporter. Their children have carried on the same brand of \ncommunity reporting, and this is why I continue to subscribe to the \npaper and read and enjoy it every week.\n  The Dopfs took pride in Cambridge and Washington County, and they \nloved it down to the smallest details. They took a special interest in \nthe youth of the area, including articles and pictures of local high \nschool sporting events, essay contest winners, invitations to baby \nshowers, and as I mentioned, 4-H and FFA news.\n  They were great community people, and they were great people in their \ncommunity. The Dopfs were a big reason I had such a positive experience \ngrowing up in rural Washington County. It is people like them who make \nCambridge, Midvale, Weiser, and other small towns across Idaho great \nplaces to live. I'm sure they are resting peacefully in Heaven.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/16/senate-section/article/S1503-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO WALLACE RUSTAD\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a member of \nmy staff who will be retiring from his position in the U.S. Senate. \nWally Rustad is a man who is recognized by his colleagues and myself as \nan extremely dedicated, hard-working, and joyful public servant.\n  Mr. Rustad has had a remarkable career in public service, spanning \nclose to half a century. He joined the Army in 1955, where he served in \nGermany until 1958 and in the Reserves until 1961. Following that, he \ntaught high school history and literature in Williston, ND. In 1965, he \npursued his interest in politics with a move to Washington, D.C. to \nbecome a legislative assistant for the Honorable Rolland Redlin in the \nU.S. House of Representatives. After 2 years, he returned to North \nDakota to work for Basin Electric Cooperative. But in 1970, he was \ndrawn back to Washington, D.C. to work for Congressman Arthur Link in \nthe U.S. House of Representatives as chief of staff and senior \nspokesperson.\n  With experience gained from his time on Capitol Hill, Mr. Rustad went \non to a position with the National Rural Electric Cooperative \nAssociation, where he soon became the director of Government Relations. \nHis work at the NRECA was recognized and praised by many. Under his \ndirection, the NRECA saw the strength of its political influence grow \nsubstantially, prompting the Wall Street Journal to call the co-op \nlobby the second most powerful in Washington. He spent his years on the \npolitical front lines defending against attacks on the rural electric \nprogram. On February 17, 2004, Wally was presented with the prestigious \nClyde T. Ellis Award, which honors an individual for contributions \nclearly above the routine call of duty in furthering the principles and \nprogress of rural electrification and the development and utilization \nof national resources.\n  For the past 5\\1/2\\ years, I have been honored to have Wally serve on \nmy staff. He brought with him his extensive experience in the energy \nindustry and rural economic development and a tremendous dedication to \nour home State of North Dakota. During his tenure in my office, he has \nworked on economic development issues for North Dakota and in outreach \nto numerous individuals and groups throughout the State. As my State \nliaison, he has built strong rapport and stayed in close contact with \nconstituents, responding to needs and monitoring priority issues to \nmake sure that the views of North Dakotans are represented in \nWashington.\n  A native of Grenora, ND, population 261, Wally is a tremendous \nadvocate for our home State. He and his family still own a farm near \nGrenora. Last summer, Wally and his wife, Marlys, organized a trip for \na group of 38 of their friends to tour the State. They visited the \nLewis & Clark Interpretive Center and trails along the Missouri River, \ntoured the Theodore Roosevelt National Park, attended the musical and \npitch fork fondue in Medora, and did a lot of golfing. His tour group \nwas awed by the history and beauty of the State and, of course, its \ngolf courses. As Wally put it, it was ``one small thing'' he could do \nto help promote economic development and tourism in North Dakota.\n  Wally and his wife of 43 years, Marlys Rustad nee Jacobson, live in \nLeesburg, VA. Their daughter Kimberly and her husband, Clark Kelly, and \ntheir children, Avery, Kate and William, live in Mobile, AL. Their \ndaughter Jill and her husband Jonathan Adler, and their children, \nJulia, Jami and Jessica, live in Leesburg, VA. Jon, their son, lives in \nLos Angeles, CA.\n  Wally is a man with great dedication to public service. He arrives at \nwork each day shortly after 6 a.m., after commuting for 2 hours, and \nbrews the first pot of coffee. He greets his colleagues with a smile on \nhis face and the news of the day as they arrive into work. As the late \nNorth Dakota Senator Quentin Burdick once said, ``Wally Rustad is a \nsmall-town North Dakotan who has made it big in Washington. He has a \ngenuine commitment to serving the people of rural America.''\n  As Wally goes forward in his life, I hope that he proudly looks back \nfrom time to time and knows what a difference he has made in the lives \nof so many people. He is a good friend and a wonderful American whom I \nam honored to have had the pleasure to work with. I commend him for his \naccomplishments and outstanding service and wish him well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/16/senate-section/article/S1503-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1503-S1504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO RUSS DONDERO\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nProfessor Russ Dondero of Pacific University in Forest Grove, OR. \nProfessor Dondero is retiring from a full-time teaching load in the \nDepartment of Politics and Government at the end of this school year. \nHe is being honored this week by his current and former students and \nfriends during events leading up to the annual Pacific University Tom \nMcCall Forum in Portland, OR on February 17.\n  The Tom McCall Forum may be Professor Dondero's most visible \naccomplishment. Now in its 23rd year, the forum has become the premier \npublic affairs event in the Pacific Northwest, drawing national \npolitical figures each year for a spirited debate between a liberal and \na conservative of national interest. The driving force throughout the \nForum's history has been Professor Dondero. He has taken the event from \nthe small confines of a basement room on campus to an event that \nattracts over 1,000 people and the cameras of C-SPAN.\n\n[[Page S1504]]\n\n  While the forum gives a public face to Professor Dondero's work, his \nties to and influence on our State of Oregon runs much deeper. A 1960 \ngraduate of Roseburg High School, Professor Dondero left Oregon to \npursue his academic calling at Whitman College, the University of \nMinnesota and Dickinson College. He returned home with his wife, Ann, \nto raise their sons, Tony and Jason.\n  During his 31 years of teaching at Pacific, Professor Dondero acted \nas teacher, mentor and friend to students past and present. Like a \nsuccessful coach, Professor Dondero has always known which lever to \npull to draw the best possible performance out of those with whom he \nworked. He has an instinct that can't be taught--how to inspire his \nstudents to succeed by deploying the appropriate tactic at the right \nmoment.\n  Outside of the classroom, Professor Dondero has been relentless in \nseeking out opportunities for his students so they could apply in the \nfield the lessons they learned. I have been proud to put some of his \nstudents to work in my office.\n  It is fitting that many of his former students and Pacific University \nhave established the Russell A. Dondero Fellowship. In the future, \nfellowship recipients at Pacific will receive a small stipend to offset \nthe cost of living while pursuing an internship as part of their \nacademic program--which will certainly make it possible for more \nstudents to take advantage of this important experience.\n  His academic work is only part of Russ Dondero's story. It would be \nhard to locate a more passionate, talented and effective advocate for \naffordable housing in the State of Oregon. I am confident he will \ncontinue to use his talents and energies for this important cause, and \nthat he and Ann will continue to shape the lives of his students and \nhis community.\n  W. B. Yeats once wrote, ``Education is not the filling of a bucket, \nbut the lighting of a fire.'' I am proud to join with the Pacific \nUniversity community in thanking Russ Dondero for lighting fires that \nwill continue to burn for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/16/senate-section/article/S1504-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRANSMITTING AS AMENDED, AND 12947 OF 01-23-95, AS AMENDED WITH A NEW \n EXECUTIVE ORDER CLARIFYING CERTAIN EXECUTIVE ORDERS BLOCKING PROPERTY \n               AND PROHIBITING CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS--PM 5\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to, inter alia, section 203(a) of the International \nEmergency Economic Powers Act, (50 U.S.C. 1702 (a)) (IEEPA) and section \n201(a) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1621 (a)) (NEA), I \nexercised my statutory authority to declare national emergencies in \nExecutive Orders 13224 of September 23, 2001, as amended, and 12947 of \nJanuary 23, 1995, as amended.

A bill to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to \nprohibit certain State election administration officials from actively \nparticipating in electoral campaigns; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Federal \nElection Integrity Act on behalf of myself and Senators Kerry, Boxer \nand Clinton. This bill creates a direct prohibition on chief State \nelection officials from taking part in political campaigns by amending \nthe Federal Campaign Act of 1971.\n  Legislation is very much needed to eliminate an inherent conflict of \ninterest that exists when a State's chief election administration \nofficial--the Secretary of State, the State Attorney General, or the \nLieutenant Governor--is responsible for monitoring, supervising and \ncertifying the results of a Federal election, while actively involved \nin the campaign of one of the candidates in that election.\n  I know that this is a practice engaged in by both Democratic and \nRepublican State officials on behalf of Federal candidates, but those \nofficials in charge of certifying Federal elections must not allowed to \nserve two masters--the voters and the Federal candidate. It is not \nright and it undermines the faith and confidence that Americans in this \nNation's election system, and impugns the integrity of the State \nelection official and the Federal candidate. The will of voters must \ncome before the personal partisan politics.\n  In 2000 and again in 2004, we have witnessed two Secretaries of State \ncapturing national press attention because of their involvement in \nelections where, literally, every single vote mattered.\n  In the 2004 presidential election, Ohio Secretary of State Ken \nBlackwell was co-chairman of President Bush's re-election campaign in \nOhio. On December 6th, 2004, Secretary of State Blackwell certified \nPresident Bush as the winner in Ohio with an 118,775-vote lead--closer \nthan unofficial election night results, but not close enough to trigger \na mandatory recount. Recount advocates have cited numerous Election Day \nproblems in Ohio, including long lines, a shortage of voting machines \nin predominantly minority neighborhoods, and suspicious vote totals for \ncandidates in scattered precincts.\n  In the 2000 election, Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris \nserved as co-chair of President Bush's Florida campaign. President \nBush's narrow victory in Florida gave him the State's 25 electoral \nvotes necessary to win the presidency. A recount of thousands of \nFlorida ballots and resulting court battles held up a resolution to the \nelection for five weeks. There were reports of improprieties by \nSecretary of State Harris, including ballot tampering and the tampering \nof office computer files with Bush talking points and other supportive \nmaterial.\n  Just recently, California Secretary of State Kevin Shelley--a \nDemocrat--resigned due to allegations that he improperly used Federal \nelection funds for partisan activities.\n  In all these cases, I am sure that the Secretaries of State were \nhonorable public servants who made some very unpopular, difficult \ndecisions under intense public scrutiny. But as far as the voters are \nconsidered, the Secretaries engaged in partisan political activity that \ntainted the results of the elections. This legislation fixes that.\n  Secretaries of State and other State election officials with \nsupervisory authority over the administration of Federal elections \nshould not be actively involved in the political campaign or management \nof a candidate running for Federal office in their State. The Secretary \nof State is the primary election administration official in 39 States; \ndespite that, history has shown numerous Secretaries of State chairing \nthe political campaigns of Federal candidates in their State.\n  There is a direct conflict of interest when an election official \ncharged with supervising the administration of Federal elections and \nensuring the fairness and accuracy of the results of Federal elections \nhas a direct role in a Federal candidate's campaign.\n  Again, this is not an issue of Democrats versus Republicans. Rather, \nthis is an issue of preserving the American people's faith and \nconfidence in the election process. Simply put, election officials \nresponsible for ensuring fair and accurate Federal elections should not \nbe actively cheering for and aiding a candidate in those elections.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the ``Federal Election \nIntegrity Act'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 391\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S1516]]\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Election Integrity \n     Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) chief State election administration officials have \n     served on political campaigns for Federal candidates whose \n     elections those officials will supervise;\n       (2) such partisan activity by the chief State election \n     administration official, an individual charged with \n     certifying the validity of an election, represents a \n     fundamental conflict of interest that may prevent the \n     official from ensuring a fair and accurate election;\n       (3) this conflict impedes the legal duty of chief State \n     election administration officials to supervise Federal \n     elections, undermines the integrity of Federal elections, and \n     diminishes the people's confidence in our electoral system by \n     casting doubt on the results of Federal elections;\n       (4) the Supreme Court has long recognized that Congress's \n     power to regulate Congressional elections under Article I, \n     Section 4, Clause 1 of the Constitution is both plenary and \n     powerful; and\n       (5) the Supreme Court and numerous appellate courts have \n     recognized that the broad power given to Congress over \n     Congressional elections extends to Presidential elections.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON CAMPAIGN ACTIVITIES BY ELECTION \n                   ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Title III of the Federal Election Campaign \n     Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. 431 et seq.) is amended by inserting \n     after section 319 the following new section:\n\n\n              ``CAMPAIGN ACTIVITIES BY ELECTION OFFICIALS\n\n       ``Sec. 319A.

A bill to authorize the President to award a gold medal on \nbehalf of Congress, collectively, to the Tuskegee Airmen in recognition \nof their unique military record, which inspired revolutionary reform in \nthe Armed Forces; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, during the last Session of the 108th \nCongress, I informed my colleagues of my intention to introduce \nbipartisan legislation in the 109th Congress, to authorize the awarding \nof the Congressional Gold Medal, collectively, to the ``Tuskegee \nAirmen.''\n  Congress has commissioned the gold medal as its highest expression of \nnational appreciation for distinguished achievements and contributions. \nToday, I am pleased to be joined by Senators McCain, Stabenow, Dole, \nObama, Graham, Rockefeller, Pryor, Ben Nelson, Landrieu and Kerry in \nintroducing legislation, S. 392, that would bestow this great honor on \nthe Tuskegee Airmen, in recognition of their extraordinary courage and \nunwavering determination to become America's first black military \nairmen.\n  The Tuskegee Airmen were not only unique in their military record, \nbut they inspired revolutionary reform in the armed forces, paving the \nway for integration of the Armed Services in the U.S. The largely \ncollege educated Tuskegee Airmen overcame the enormous challenges of \nprejudice and discrimination, succeeding, despite obstacles that \nthreatened failure. What made these men exceptional was their \nwillingness to leave their families and put their lives on the line to \ndefend rights that were denied them here at home. Congresswoman Helen \nGahagan Douglas of California, in remarks on the floor of the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives on February 1, 1946 summed it up this way:\n\n       The Negro soldier made his contribution in World War II . . \n     . he has met the test of patriotism and heroism. We should be \n     especially mindful . . . remembering that he fought and shed \n     his blood for a freedom which he has not as yet been \n     permitted fully to share. I wish to pay him the respect and \n     to express the gratitude of the American people for his \n     contribution in the greatest battle of all time the battle \n     which decided whether or not we were to remain a free people. \n     The names of Negro heroes in this war are everlastingly \n     recorded among the living and the dead . . . in every combat \n     area, on land, on sea, in the air.\n\n  Former Senator Bill Cohen, in remarks on the floor of the Senate \ndecades later, in July of 1995, said: ``. . . I listened to the stories \nof the Tuskegee airmen and . . . the turmoil they experienced fighting \nin World War II, feeling they had to fight two enemies: one called \nHitler, the other called racism in this country.''\n  The superior record of the Tuskegee Airmen in World War II was \naccomplished by individuals who accepted the challenge and proudly \ndisplayed their skill and determination in the face of racism and \nbigotry at home, despite their distinguished war records. Prior to the \n1940s, many in the military held the sadly, mistaken view that black \nservicemen were unfit for most leadership roles and mentally incapable \nof combat aviation. Between 1924 and 1939, the Army War College \ncommissioned a number of studies aimed at increasing the military role \nof blacks. According to The Air Force Magazine , Journal of the Air \nForce Association, March 1996, ``. . . these studies asserted that \nblacks possessed brains significantly smaller than those of white \ntroops and were predisposed to lack physical courage. The reports \nmaintained that the Army should increase opportunities for blacks to \nhelp meet manpower requirements but claimed that they should always be \ncommanded by whites and should always serve in segregated units.''\n  Overruling his top generals and to his credit, President Franklin \nRoosevelt in 1941 ordered the creation of an all black flight training \nprogram at Tuskegee Institute. He did so one day after Howard \nUniversity student Yancy Williams filed suit in Federal Court to force \nthe Department of Defense to accept black pilot trainees. Yancy \nWilliams had a civilian pilot's license, and received an engineering \ndegree. Years later, ``Major Yancy Williams,'' participated in an air \nsurveillance project created by President Eisenhower.\n  ``We proved that the antidote to racism is excellence in \nperformance,'' said retired Lt. Col. Herbert Carter, who started his \nmilitary career as a pilot and maintenance officer with the 99th \nFighter Squadron. ``Can you imagine . . . with the war clouds as heavy \nas they were over Europe, a citizen of the\n\n[[Page S1517]]\n\nUnited States having to sue his government to be accepted to training \nso he could fly and fight and die for his country?'' The government \nexpected the experiment to fail and end the issue, said Carter. The \nmistake they made was that they forgot to tell us . . .''\n  The first class of cadets began in July of 1941 with thirteen men, \nall of whom had college degrees, some with PhD's and all had pilot's \nlicenses. Based on the aforementioned studies, the training of the \nTuskegee Airmen was an experiment established to prove that \n``coloreds'' were incapable of operating expensive and complex combat \naircraft.\n  By 1943, the first of contingent of black airmen were sent to North \nAfrica, Sicily and Europe. Their performance far exceeded anyone's \nexpectation. They shot down six German aircraft on their first mission, \nand were also the first squad to sink a battleship with only machine \nguns. Overall, nearly 1000 black pilots graduated from Tuskegee, 450 of \nwhom served in combat with the last class finishing in June of 1946,. \nSixty-six of the aviators died in combat, while another 33 were shot \ndown and captured as prisoners of war. The Tuskegee Airmen were \ncredited with 261 aircraft destroyed, 148 aircraft damaged, 15,553 \ncombat sorties and 1,578 missions over Italy and North Africa. They \ndestroyed or damaged over 950 units of ground transportation and \nescorted more than 200 bombing missions. Clearly, the experiment, as it \nwas called, was an unqualified success. Black men could not only fly, \nthey excelled at it, and were equal partners in America's victory.\n  A number of Tuskegee Airmen have lived in Michigan, including \nAlexander Jefferson, Washington Ross, Wardell Polk, and Walter Downs, \namong others. Tuskegee Airmen also trained at Michigan's Selfridge and \nOscoda air fields in the early 40's. In the early 1970's, the Airmen \nestablished their first chapter in Detroit. Today there are 42 chapters \nlocated in major cities of the U.S. The chapters support young people \nthrough scholarships, sponsorships to the military academies, and \nflight training programs. Detroit is also the location of The Tuskegee \nAirmen National Museum, which is on the grounds of historic Fort Wayne. \nThe late Coleman Young, former Mayor of the City of Detroit was trained \nas a navigator bombardier for the 477th bombardment group of the \nTuskegee Airmen. This group was still in training when WWII ended so \nthey never saw combat. However, the important fact is that all of those \nreceiving flight related training--nearly 1,000--were instrumental in \nbreaking the segregation barrier. They all had a willingness to see \ncombat, and committed themselves to the segregated training with a \npurpose to defend their country.\n  The Tuskegee Airmen were awarded three Presidential Unit \nCitations,150 Distinguished Flying Crosses and Legions of Merit, along \nwith The Red Star of Yugoslavia, 9 Purple Hearts, 14 Bronze Stars and \nmore than 700 Air medals and clusters. It goes without question that \nthe Tuskegee Airmen are deserving of the Congressional Gold Medal. \nAccording to existing records, I am proud to say that 155 Tuskegee \nAirmen originated from my State of Michigan.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to swiftly act on this \nlegislation, a most deserving honor and tribute to the Tuskegee Airmen. \nI also ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 392\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt overruled his \n     top generals and ordered the creation of an all Black flight \n     training program. President Roosevelt took this action one \n     day after the NAACP filed suit on behalf of Howard University \n     student Yancy Williams and others in Federal court to force \n     the Department of War to accept Black pilot trainees. Yancy \n     Williams had a civilian pilot's license and had earned an \n     engineering degree. Years later, Major Yancy Williams \n     participated in an air surveillance project created by \n     President Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n       (2) Due to the rigid system of racial segregation that \n     prevailed in the United States during World War II, Black \n     military pilots were trained at a separate airfield built \n     near Tuskegee, Alabama. They became known as the ``Tuskegee \n     Airmen''.\n       (3) The Tuskegee Airmen inspired revolutionary reform in \n     the Armed Forces, paving the way for full racial integration \n     in the Armed Forces. They overcame the enormous challenges of \n     prejudice and discrimination, succeeding, despite obstacles \n     that threatened failure.\n       (4) From all accounts, the training of the Tuskegee Airmen \n     was an experiment established to prove that so-called \n     ``coloreds'' were incapable of operating expensive and \n     complex combat aircraft. Studies commissioned by the Army War \n     College between 1924 and 1939 concluded that Blacks were \n     unfit for leadership roles and incapable of aviation. \n     Instead, the Tuskegee Airmen excelled.\n       (5) Overall, some 992 Black pilots graduated from the pilot \n     training program of the Tuskegee Army Air Field, with the \n     last class finishing in June 1946, 450 of whom served in \n     combat. The first class of cadets began in July 1941 with 13 \n     airmen, all of whom had college degrees, some with Ph.D.'s, \n     and all of whom had pilot's licenses. One of the graduates \n     was Captain Benjamin O. Davis Jr., a United States Military \n     Academy graduate. Four aviation cadets were commissioned as \n     second lieutenants, and 5 received Army Air Corps silver \n     pilot wings.\n       (6) That the experiment achieved success rather than the \n     expected failure is further evidenced by the eventual \n     promotion of 3 of these pioneers through the commissioned \n     officer ranks to flag rank, including the late General \n     Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., United States Air Force, the late \n     General Daniel ``Chappie'' James, United States Air Force, \n     our Nation's first Black 4-star general, and Major General \n     Lucius Theus, United States Air Force (retired).\n       (7) Four hundred fifty Black fighter pilots under the \n     command of then Colonel Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., fought in \n     World War II aerial battles over North Africa, Sicily, and \n     Europe, flying, in succession, P-40, P-39, P-47, and P-51 \n     aircraft. These gallant men flew 15,553 sorties and 1,578 \n     missions with the 12th Tactical Air Force and the 15th \n     Strategic Air Force.\n       (8) Colonel Davis later became the first Black flag officer \n     of the United States Air Force, retired as a 3-star general, \n     and was honored with a 4th star in retirement by President \n     William J. Clinton.\n       (9) German pilots, who both feared and respected the \n     Tuskegee Airmen, called them the ``Schwartze Vogelmenshen'' \n     (or ``Black Birdmen''). White American bomber crews \n     reverently referred to them as the ``Black Redtail Angels'', \n     because of the bright red painted on the tail assemblies of \n     their fighter aircraft and because of their reputation for \n     not losing bombers to enemy fighters as they provided close \n     escort for bombing missions over strategic targets in Europe.\n       (10) The 99th Fighter Squadron, after having distinguished \n     itself over North Africa, Sicily, and Italy, joined 3 other \n     Black squadrons, the 100th, the 301st, and the 302nd, \n     designated as the 332nd Fighter Group. They then comprised \n     the largest fighter unit in the 15th Air Force. From Italian \n     bases, they destroyed many enemy targets on the ground and at \n     sea, including a German destroyer in strafing attacks, and \n     they destroyed numerous enemy aircraft in the air and on the \n     ground.\n       (11) Sixty-six of these pilots were killed in combat, while \n     another 32 were either forced down or shot down and captured \n     to become prisoners of war. These Black airmen came home with \n     150 Distinguished Flying Crosses, Bronze Stars, Silver Stars, \n     and Legions of Merit, one Presidential Unit Citation, and the \n     Red Star of Yugoslavia.\n       (12) Other Black pilots, navigators, bombardiers and \n     crewman who were trained for medium bombardment duty as the \n     477th Bomber Group (Medium) were joined by veterans of the \n     332nd Fighter Group to form the 477th Composite Group, flying \n     the B-25 and P-47 aircraft. The demands of the members of the \n     477th Composite Group for parity in treatment and for \n     recognition as competent military professionals, combined \n     with the magnificent wartime records of the 99th Fighter \n     Squadron and the 332nd Fighter Group, led to a review of the \n     racial policies of the Department of War.\n       (13) In September 1947, the United States Air Force, as a \n     separate service, reactivated the 332d Fighter Group under \n     the Tactical Air command. Members of the 332d Fighter Group \n     were ``Top Guns'' in the 1st annual Air Force Gunnery Meet in \n     1949.\n       (14) For every Black pilot there were 12 other civilian or \n     military Black men and women performing ground support \n     duties. Many of these men and women remained in the military \n     service during the post-World War II era and spearheaded the \n     integration of the Armed Forces of the United States.\n       (15) Major achievements are attributed to many of those who \n     returned to civilian life and earned leadership positions and \n     respect as businessmen, corporate executives, religious \n     leaders, lawyers, doctors, educators, bankers, and political \n     leaders.\n       (16) A period of nearly 30 years of anonymity for the \n     Tuskegee Airmen was ended in 1972 with the founding of \n     Tuskegee Airmen, Inc., in Detroit, Michigan. Organized as a \n     non-military and nonprofit entity, Tuskegee Airmen, Inc., \n     exists primarily to motivate and inspire young Americans to \n     become participants in our Nation's society and its \n     democratic process, and to preserve the history of their \n     legacy.\n\n[[Page S1518]]\n\n       (17) The Tuskegee Airmen have several memorials in place to \n     perpetuate the memory of who they were and what they \n     accomplished, including--\n       (A) the Tuskegee Airmen, Inc., National Scholarship Fund \n     for high school seniors who excel in mathematics, but need \n     financial assistance to begin a college program;\n       (B) a museum in historic Fort Wayne in Detroit, Michigan;\n       (C) Memorial Park at the Air Force Museum at Wright-\n     Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio;\n       (D) a statue of a Tuskegee Airman in the Honor Park at the \n     United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, \n     Colorado; and\n       (E) a National Historic Site at Moton Field, where primary \n     flight training was performed under contract with the \n     Tuskegee Institute.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n       (a) Presentation Authorized.--The President is authorized \n     to award to the Tuskegee Airmen, on behalf of Congress, a \n     gold medal of appropriate design honoring the Tuskegee Airmen \n     in recognition of their unique military record, which \n     inspired revolutionary reform in the Armed Forces.\n       (b) Design and Striking.--For the purposes of the award \n     referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury \n     (hereafter in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') \n     shall strike a gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and \n     inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.\n\n     SEC. 3. DUPLICATE MEDALS.\n\n       Under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the \n     Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of the \n     gold medal struck under section 2, at a price sufficient to \n     cover the costs of the medals, including labor, materials, \n     dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses.\n\n     SEC. 4. NATIONAL MEDALS.\n\n       Medals struck pursuant to this Act are national medals for \n     purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 5.

A bill to require enhanced disclosure to consumers regarding \nthe consequences of making only minimum required payments in the \nrepayment of credit card debt, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Credit Card Minimum \nPayment Warning Act. I thank Senators Durbin, Leahy, Sarbanes, and \nSchumer for working with me on this legislation and for cosponsoring \nthis bill.\n  I am deeply concerned about the enormous debt burdens that Americans \nare currently carrying. I share the concern on debts we expect from the \nSocial Security program. Revolving Debt, mostly comprised of credit \ncard debt, has increased from $54 billion in January 1980 to more than \n$780 billion in November 2004. A U.S. Public Interest Research Group \nand Consumer Federation of America analysis of Federal Reserve data \nindicates that the average household with debt carries approximately \n$10,000 to $12,000 in total revolving debt and has nine credit cards.\n  During all of 1980, only 287,570 consumers filed for bankruptcy. As \nconsumer debt burdens have ballooned, the number of bankruptcies have \nincreased significantly. From January through September of 2004, \napproximately 1.2 million consumers filed for bankruptcy, keeping pace \nwith last year's record level.\n  It is imperative that we make consumers more aware of the long-term \neffects of their financial decisions, particularly in managing their \ncredit card debt, so that they can avoid financial pitfalls that may \nlead to bankruptcy.\n  While it is relatively easy to obtain credit, not enough is done to \nensure that credit is properly managed. Currently, credit card \nstatements fail to include all of the information necessary to allow \nindividuals to make fully informed financial decisions. Additional \ndisclosure is needed to ensure that individuals completely understand \nthe implications of their credit card use and costs of only making the \nminimum payments required by credit card companies.\n  Our legislation will provide a wake up call for consumers. It will \nmake it very clear what costs consumers will incur if they make only \nthe minimum payments on their credit cards. The personalized \ninformation they will receive for each of their accounts will help them \nto make informed choices about the payments that they choose to make \ntowards reducing their balance.\n  This bill requires a minimum payment warning notification on monthly \nstatements stating that making the minimum payment will increase the \namount of interest that will be paid and extend the amount of time it \nwill take to repay the outstanding balance. The bill also requires \ninforming consumers of how many years and months it will take to repay \ntheir entire balance if they make only the minimum payments. In \naddition, the total cost in interest and principal, if the consumer \npays only the minimum payment, would have to be disclosed. These \nprovisions will make individuals much more aware of the true costs of \ntheir credit card debts. The bill also requires that credit card \ncompanies provide useful information so that people can develop \nstrategies to free themselves of credit card debt. Consumers would have \nto be provided with the amount they need to pay to eliminate their \noutstanding balance within 36 months.\n  Finally, the legislation would require that creditors establish a \ntoll-free number so that consumers can access trustworthy credit \ncounselors. In order to ensure that consumers are referred from the \ntoll-free number to only trustworthy organizations, the agencies for \nreferral would have to be approved by the Federal Trade Commission and \nthe Federal Reserve Board as having met comprehensive quality \nstandards. These standards are necessary because certain credit \ncounseling agencies have abused their nonprofit, tax-exempt status and \nhave taken advantage of people seeking assistance in managing their \ndebts. Many people believe, sometimes mistakenly, that they can place \nblind trust in nonprofit organizations and that their fees will be \nlower than those of other credit counseling organizations. Too many \nindividuals may not realize that the credit counseling industry does \nnot deserve the trust that consumers often place in it.\n  The Credit Card Minimum Payment Warning Act has been endorsed by the \nConsumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, U.S. Public Interest \nResearch Group, and Consumer Action.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation that will empower \nconsumers by providing them with detailed personalized information to \nassist them in making informed choices about their credit card use and \nrepayment. This bill makes clear the adverse consequences of uninformed \nchoices such as making only minimum payments and provides opportunities \nto locate assistance to eliminate credit card debts.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support and fact sheet from \norganizations in support of the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 January 28, 2005.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Richard J. Durbin\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Akaka, Durbin and Sarbanes: The undersigned \n     national consumer organizations write to strongly support the \n     Credit Card Minimum Payment Warning Act. The Act would \n     require credit card issuers to disclose more information to \n     consumers about the costs associated with paying their bills \n     at ever-declining minimum payment rates. The Act provides a \n     personalized ``price tag'' so consumers can understand what \n     are the real costs of credit card debt and avoid financial \n     problems in the future.\n       Undisputed evidence links the rise in bankruptcy in recent \n     years to the increase in consumer credit outstanding. These \n     numbers have moved in lockstep for more than 20 years. \n     Revolving credit, for example (most of which is credit card \n     debt) ballooned from $214 billion in January 1990 to over \n     $780 billion currently. As family debt increases, debt \n     service payments on items such as interest and late fees take \n     an ever-increasing piece of their budget. For some families, \n     this contributes to the collapse of their budget. Bankruptcy \n     becomes the only way out. (See the attached fact sheet for \n     more information about the scope and impact of credit card \n     debt.)\n\n[[Page S1519]]\n\n       Credit card issuers have exacerbated the financial problems \n     that many families have faced by lowering minimum payment \n     amounts, from around 4 percent of the balance owed, to about \n     2 percent currently. This decline in the typical minimum \n     payment is a significant reason for the rise in consumer \n     bankruptcies in recent years. A low minimum payment often \n     barely covers interest obligations. It convinces many \n     borrowers that they are financially sound as long as they can \n     meet all of their minimum payment obligations. However, those \n     that cannot afford to make these payments often carry so much \n     debt that bankruptcy is usually the only viable option.\n       This bill will provide consumers several crucial pieces of \n     information on their monthly credit card statement:\n       A ``minimum payment warning'' that paying at the minimum \n     rate will increase the amount of interest that is owed and \n     the time it will take to repay the balance.\n       The number of years and months that it will take the \n     consumer to payoff the balance at the minimum rate.\n       The total costs in interest and principal if the consumer \n     pays at the minimum rate.\n       The monthly payment that would be required to pay the \n     balance off in three years.\n       The bill also requires that credit card companies provide a \n     toll-free number that consumers can call to receive \n     information about credit counseling and debt management \n     assistance. In order to assure that consumers are referred to \n     honest, legitimate non-profit credit counselors, the bill \n     requires the Federal Reserve to screen these agencies to \n     ensure that they meet rigorous quality standards.\n       Our groups commend you for offering this very important and \n     long-overdue piece of legislation. It provides the kind of \n     personalized, timely disclosure information that will help \n     debt-choked families make informed decisions and start to \n     work their way back to financial health.\n           Sincerely,\n     Travis B.

At simple interest, \n     with no compounding, then, consumers pay at least $85 billion \n     annually in interest on credit card and other revolving debt.\n       Just about 55 percent of consumers carry debt. The rest are \n     convenience users.\n       From PIRG/CFA analysis of Federal Reserve data, the average \n     household with debt carries approximately $10,000-12,000 in \n     total revolving debt and has approximately nine cards.\n\n           Facts About the Effect of Minimum Monthly Payments\n\n       A household making the monthly minimum required payments on \n     this debt (usually the greater of 2 percent of the unpaid \n     balance or $20) at the very low average 12.4% APR (many \n     consumers pay much higher penalty rates than this FRB-\n     reported average) would pay $1,175 in interest just in the \n     first year, even if these cards are cut up and not used \n     again.\n       This household would pay a total of over $9,800 in interest \n     over a period of 25 years and three months. That fact is not \n     disclosed.\n       A household or consumer who merely doubled their minimum \n     payment and paid 4% of the amount due would fare better. A \n     household or consumer that paid 10% of the balance each month \n     would fare much better. Here is a comparison.\n     Minimum payment warnings would encourage larger payments and \n         save consumers thousands of dollars in high-priced credit \n         card debt.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                            Monthly Payment (% of unpaid\n   Credit card debt of $10,000 at Modest              balance)\n                 12.4% APR                 -----------------------------\n                                               2%        4%        10%\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFirst Year Interest =.....................    $1,175    $1,054      $775\nTotal Interest Owed =.....................    $9,834    $3,345    $1,129\nMonths To Pay.............................       303       127        52\nYears To Pay..............................      25.3      10.6       4.3\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCalculations by U.S. PIRG.

These families saw the largest increase--a 184 \n     percent rise in their debt--but even very high-income \n     families had 28 percent more credit card debt in 2001 than \n     they did in 1989. Source: Demos.\n       Thirty-nine percent of student loan borrowers now graduate \n     with unmanageable levels of debt, meaning that their monthly \n     payments are more than 8% of their monthly incomes. According \n     to PIRG analysis of the 1999-2000 NPSAS data, in 2001, 41% of \n     the graduating seniors carried a credit card balance, with an \n     average balance of $3,071. Student loan borrowers were even \n     more likely to carry credit card debt, with 48% of borrowers \n     carrying an average credit card balance of $3,176.

A bill to promote accessibility, accountability, and openness \nin Government by strengthening section 552 of title 5, United States \nCode (commonly referred to as the Freedom of Information Act), and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill, along \nwith the Senator from Vermont who we will hear from shortly, that will \nhelp enhance the openness of the Federal Government. This bill is \ncalled the Open Government Act of 2005. It is a bipartisan effort to \nimprove and update our public information laws--particularly the \nFreedom of Information Act.\n  The purpose of the bill is to arm the American people with the \ninformation they need to make certain that ours remains a government \nwhose legitimacy is derived from the consent of the governed. This \nlegislation will significantly expand the accessibility, \naccountability, and openness of the Federal Government.\n  Open government, of course, is one of the most basic requirements of \na healthy democracy. It allows taxpayers to see where their money is \ngoing. It permits the honest exchange of information that ensures \ngovernment accountability, and it upholds the ideal that government \nnever rules without the consent of the governed. As is so often the \ncase, Abraham Lincoln said it best:\n\n       No man is good enough to govern another without that \n     person's consent.\n\n  But achieving the true consent of the governed requires something \nmore than just holding elections every couple of years. What we need is \ninformed consent. Informed consent is impossible without open and \naccessible government.\n  It has been nearly a decade since Congress has approved major reforms \nto the Freedom of Information Act. The Senate Judiciary Committee has \nnot convened an oversight hearing to examine the Freedom of Information \nAct compliance issue since 1992. And at that time, I believe it is \nclear that the growth of technology and the Internet has created a real \ndesire among the American people to achieve direct, efficient, and open \naccess to government information.\n  I thank my colleague from Vermont, the ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee, who has long been a champion of these issues, for \nhis hard work on this bill. Together our offices have spent a good deal \nof time meeting with open government advocates. I am proud to say this \nbill is supported by a broad coalition across the ideological spectrum, \nbecause I believe this legislation should not be a partisan or special \ninterest bill. Indeed, it is not.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these endorsement letters from dozens of \nwatchdog groups across the political spectrum be printed in the Record \nat the close of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as the Senator from Vermont said at a \nrecent Judiciary Committee hearing:\n\n       I have always found that every administration, Republican \n     or Democrat, would love to keep a whole lot of things from \n     the public. They do something they are proud of, they will \n     send out a hundred press releases. Otherwise, they will hold \n     it back. We have the Freedom of Information Act, which is \n     a very good thing. It keeps both Democratic and Republican \n     administrations in line.\n\n  I agree with that. Essentially, we are talking about human nature. It \nis only natural that elected officials and Government leaders want \nrecognition for their successes but not their failures. But we, as a \nhealthy democracy, need to know the good, the bad, and the ugly.\n  The news media, of course, is the main way people get information \nabout the Government. The media pushes Government entities and elected \nofficials, bureaucrats, and agencies to release information that the \npeople have the right to know, occasionally exposing waste, fraud, and \nabuse--and hopefully more often than that letting the American people \nknow what a good job their public officials are doing.\n  But we have also seen in recent years an expansion of other outlets \nfor sharing information outside of the mainstream media to online \ncommunities, discussion groups, and blogs. I believe all these outlets \ncan and do contribute to the health of our political democracy.\n  Let me make this clear. This is not just a bill for the media, lest \nanybody be confused. This is a bill that will benefit every man, woman, \nand child in the United States of America who cares about the Federal \nGovernment, cares about how the Federal Government operates, and \nultimately cares about the success of this great democracy.\n  By reforming our information policies in order to guarantee true \naccess by all citizens to Government records, we will revitalize the \ninformed consent that keeps America free. The Open Government Act \ncontains over a dozen substantive provisions, designed to achieve the \nfollowing four objectives:\n  First, it will strengthen the Freedom of Information Act and close \nloopholes.\n  Secondly, it will help Freedom of Information Act requesters obtain \ntimely responses to their requests.\n  Third, it will ensure that agencies have strong incentives to comply \nwith the law in a timely fashion.\n  Fourth, it will provide Freedom of Information Act officials; that \nis, people within Government agencies, with all the tools, including \nthe education, they need in order to ensure that our Government remains \nopen and accessible.\n\n[[Page S1521]]\n\n  This legislation is not just pro-openness, pro-accountability and \npro-accessibility; it is also pro-Internet. It contains important \ncongressional findings to reiterate the presumption of openness. It \nincludes a provision for a hotline that enables citizens to track the \nrequests and even allows tracking of those requests via the Internet. \nAs a whole, the Open Government Act reiterates the principle that our \nGovernment is based not on the need to know but rather on the right to \nknow.\n  We all recognize that America's security should never take a back \nseat. But nor should the claim, without justification, of national \nsecurity be used as a barrier against allowing taxpayers to know how \ntheir money is being spent.\n  There is a broad consensus across the aisle, the political spectrum, \nthat we currently overclassify Government documents, and that many \ndocuments and much information is placed beyond the public view without \nany real justification. I believe we need a system of classification \nthat strikes the right balance between the need to classify documents \nin the interest of our national security and our national values of \nopen government.\n  Our default position of the U.S. Government must be one of openness. \nIf records can be open, they should be open. If there is a good reason \nto keep something closed, it is the Government that should bear the \nburden, not the other way around.\n  Open government is fundamentally an American issue. It is literally \nnecessary to preserve our way of life as a self-governing people. \nEnsuring the accessibility, accountability, and openness of the Federal \nGovernment is a cause worthy of preservation, and I call on my \ncolleagues to join the Senator from Vermont and I today in taking a \nmeaningful step toward that goal.\n  Finally, before I yield the floor to the Senator from Vermont, let me \nagain express my appreciation to him and his staff. They have worked \nvery closely with my staff. This is one of those good Government \ninitiatives that knows no party affiliation, no ideological \naffiliation, but is really one that is essential to the preservation of \nour way of life as a self-governing democracy.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National Government Act of 2005\n\n       Led by U.S. Senators John Cornyn and Patrick Leahy, the \n     OPEN Government Act of 2005 is a bipartisan effort to achieve \n     meaningful reforms to federal government information laws--\n     including most notably the Freedom of Information Act of 1966 \n     (``FOIA''). If enacted, the legislation would substantially \n     enhance and expand the accessibility, accountability, and \n     openness of the federal government. It has been nearly a \n     decade since Congress has approved major reforms to FOIA. \n     Moreover, the Senate Judiciary Committee has not convened an \n     oversight hearing to examine FOIA compliance issues since \n     April 30, 1992. (The Senate Homeland Security and \n     Governmental Affairs Committee, which shares jurisdiction \n     over federal government information laws with the Judiciary \n     Committee, has not held a FOIA oversight hearing since 1980.)\n       This legislation is the culmination of months of extensive \n     discussions between the offices of Senators Cornyn and Leahy \n     and various members of the requestor community. The bill is \n     supported by Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott and a broad \n     coalition of organizations across the ideological spectrum, \n     including:\n\n     American Association of Law Libraries\n     American Civil Liberties Union\n     American Library Association\n     American Society of Newspaper Editors\n     Associated Press Managing Editors\n     Association of Health Care Journalists\n     Center for Democracy & Technology\n     Coalition of Journalists for Open Government\n     Committee of Concerned Journalists\n     Education Writers Association\n     Electronic Privacy Information Center\n     Federation of American Scientists/Project on Government \n         Secrecy\n     Free Congress Foundation/Center for Privacy & Technology \n         Policy\n     Freedom of Information Center, University of Missouri\n     The Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas\n     The Heritage Foundation/Center for Media and Public Policy\n     Information Trust\n     National Conference of Editorial Writers\n     National Freedom of Information Coalition\n     National Newspaper Association\n     National Security Archive/George Washington University\n     Newspaper Association of America\n     People for the American Way\n     Project on Government Oversight\n     Radio-Television News Directors Association\n     The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press\n     Society of Environmental Journalists\n\n       The Act contains important Congressional findings to \n     reiterate and reinforce the view that the Freedom of \n     Information Act establishes a presumption of openness, and \n     that our government is based not on the need to know, but \n     upon the fundamental right to know. The Act also contains \n     over a dozen substantive provisions, designed to achieve the \n     following four objectives:\n\n     (1) Strengthen FOIA and close loopholes\n     (2) Help FOIA requestors obtain timely responses to their \n         requests\n     (3) Ensure that agencies-have strong incentives to act on \n         FOIA requests in a timely fashion\n     (4) Provide FOIA officials with all of the tools they need to \n         ensure that our government remains open and accessible\n\n\n                  strengthen foia and close loopholes\n\n       Ensure that FOIA applies when agency recordkeeping \n     functions are outsourced\n       Establish a new open government impact statement, by \n     requiring that any future Congressional attempt to create a \n     new FOIA exemption be expressly stated within the text of the \n     legislation\n       Impose annual reporting requirement on usage of the DHS \n     disclosure exemption for critical infrastructure information\n       Protect access to FOIA fee waivers for legitimate \n     journalists, regardless of institutional association--\n     including bloggers and other Internet-based journalists\n       Provide reliable reporting of FOIA performance, by \n     requiring agencies to distinguish between first person \n     requests for personal information and other kinds of requests\n\n\n              help foia requestors obtain timely responses\n\n       Establish FOIA hotline services, either by telephone or on \n     the Internet, to enable requestors to track the status of \n     their requests\n       Create a new FOIA ombudsman, located at the Administrative \n     Conference of the United States, to review agency FOIA \n     compliance and provide alternatives to litigation\n       Authorize reasonable recovery of attorney fees when \n     litigation is inevitable\n\n\nensure that agencies have strong incentives to act on foia requests in \n                             timely fashion\n\n       Restore meaningful deadlines for agency action by ensuring \n     that the 20-day statutory clock runs immediately upon the \n     receipt of the request\n       Impose real consequences on federal agencies for missing \n     statutory deadlines\n       Enhance authority of the Office of Special Counsel to take \n     disciplinary action against government officials who \n     arbitrarily and capriciously deny disclosure\n       Strengthen reporting requirements on FOIA compliance to \n     identify agencies plagued by excessive delay, and to identify \n     excessive delays in fee status determinations\n\n\n  provide foia officials with the tools they need to ensure that our \n                 government remains open and accessible\n\n       Improve personnel policies for FOIA officials to enhance \n     agency FOIA performance\n       Examine the need for FOIA awareness training for federal \n     employees\n       Determine appropriate funding levels needed to ensure \n     agency FOIA compliance\n\n Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National Government Act of 2005\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       Sec. 1. Short Title. The Open Government Act of 2005.\n       Sec. 2. Findings. The findings reiterate the intent of \n     Congress upon enacting the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), \n     5 D.S.C. 552 as amended, and restate FOIA's presumption in \n     favor of disclosure.\n       Sec. 3. Protection of Fee Status for News Media. This \n     section amends 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)(ii) to make clear that \n     independent journalists are not barred from obtaining fee \n     waivers solely because they lack an institutional affiliation \n     with a recognized news media entity. In determining whether \n     to grant a fee waiver, an agency shall consider the prior \n     publication history of the requestor. If the requestor has no \n     prior publication history and no current affiliation with a \n     news organization, the agency shall review the requestor's \n     plans for disseminating the requested material and whether \n     those plans include distributing the material to a reasonably \n     broad audience.\n       Sec. 4. Recovery of Attorney Fees and Litigation Costs. \n     This section, the so-called Buckhannon fix, amends 5 U.S.C. \n     552(a)(4)(E) to clarify that a complainant has substantially \n     prevailed in a FOIA lawsuit, and is eligible to recover \n     attorney fees, if the complainant has obtained a substantial \n     part of his requested relief through a judicial or \n     administrative order or if the pursuit of a claim was the \n     catalyst for the voluntary or unilateral change in position \n     by the opposing party. The section responds to the Supreme \n     Court's ruling in Buckhannon Board and Care Home, Inc. v. \n     West Virginia Dep't of Health and Human Resources, 532 U.S. \n     598 (2001), which eliminated the ``catalyst theory'' of \n     attorney fee recovery under certain Federal civil rights \n     laws. FOIA requestors have raised concerns that the holding \n     in Buckhannon could be extended to FOIA cases. This section \n     preserves the ``catalyst theory'' in FOIA litigation.\n       Sec. 5. Disciplinary Actions for Arbitrary and Capricious \n     Rejections of Requests. FOIA currently requires that when a \n     court finds that agency personnel have acted arbitrarily or \n     capriciously with respect to withholding documents, the \n     Office of Special Counsel\n\n[[Page S1522]]\n\n     shall determine whether disciplinary action against the \n     involved personnel is warranted. See 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(F). \n     This section of the bill amends FOIA to require the Attorney \n     General to notify the Office of Special Counsel of any such \n     court finding and to report the same to Congress. It further \n     requires the Office of Special Counsel to report annually to \n     Congress on any actions taken by the Special Counsel to \n     investigate cases of this type.\n       Sec. 6. Time Limits for Agencies to Act on Requests. The \n     section clarifies that the 20-day time limit on responding to \n     a FOIA request commences on the date on which the request is \n     first received by the agency. Further, the section states \n     that if the agency fails to respond within the 20-day limit, \n     the agency may not then assert any FOIA exemption under 5 \n     U.S.C. 552(b), except under limited circumstances such as \n     endangerment to national security or disclosure of personal \n     private information protected by the Privacy Act of 1974, \n     unless the agency can demonstrate, by clear and convincing \n     evidence, good cause for failure to comply with the time \n     limits.\n       Sec. 7. Individualized Tracking Numbers for Requests and \n     Status Information. Requires agencies to establish tracking \n     systems by assigning a tracking number to each FOIA \n     request: notifying a requestor of the tracking number \n     within ten days of receiving a request; and establishing a \n     telephone or Internet tracking system to allow requestors \n     to easily obtain information on the status of their \n     individual requests, including an estimated date on which \n     the agency will complete action on the request.\n       Sec. 8. Specific Citations in Exemptions. 5 U.S.C. \n     552(b)(3) states that records specifically exempted from \n     disclosure by statute are exempt from FOIA. This section of \n     the bill provides that Congress may not create new statutory \n     exemptions under this provision of FOIA unless it does so \n     explicitly. Accordingly, for any new statutory exemption to \n     have effect, the statute must cite directly to 5 U.S.C. \n     552(b)(3), thereby conveying congressional intent to create a \n     new (b)(3) exemption.\n       Sec. 9. Reporting Requirements. This section adds to \n     current reporting requirements by mandating disclosure of \n     data on the 10 oldest active requests pending at each agency, \n     including the amount of time elapsed since each request was \n     originally filed. This section further requires agencies to \n     calculate and report on the average response times and range \n     of response times of FOIA requests. (Current requirements \n     mandate reporting on the median response time.) Finally, this \n     section requires reports on the number of fee status requests \n     that are granted and denied and the average number of days \n     for adjudicating fee status determinations by individual \n     agencies.\n       Sec. 10. Openness of Agency Records Maintained by a Private \n     Entity. This section clarifies that agency records kept by \n     private contractors licensed by the government to undertake \n     recordkeeping functions remain subject to FOIA just as if \n     those records were maintained by the relevant government \n     agency.\n       Sec. 11. Office of Government Services. This section \n     establishes an Office of Government Information Services \n     within the Administrative Conference of the U.S. Within that \n     office will be appointed a FOIA ombudsman to review agency \n     policies and procedures, audit agency performance, recommend \n     policy changes, and mediate disputes between FOIA requestors \n     and agencies. The establishment of an ombudsman will not \n     impact the ability of requestors to litigate FOIA claims, but \n     rather will serve to alleviate the need for litigation \n     whenever possible.\n       Sec. 12. Accessibility of Critical Infrastructure \n     Information. This section requires reports on the \n     implementation of the Critical Infrastructure Information Act \n     of 2002, 6 U.S.C. 133. Reports shall be issued from the \n     Comptroller General to the Congress on the number of private \n     sector, state, and local agency submissions of CII data to \n     the Department of Homeland Security and the number of \n     requests for access to records. The Comptroller General will \n     also be required to report on whether the nondisclosure of \n     CII material has led to increased protection of critical \n     infrastructure.\n       Sec. 13. Report on Personnel Policies Related to FOIA. This \n     section requires the Office of Personnel Management to \n     examine how FOIA can be better implemented at the agency \n     level, including an assessment of whether FOIA performance \n     should be considered as a factor in personnel performance \n     reviews, whether a job classification series specific to FOIA \n     and the Privacy Act should be considered, and whether FOIA \n     awareness training should be provided to federal employees.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                                                February 15, 2005.\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the \n         Constitution, Civil Rights & Property Rights, Washington \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: I strongly endorse the proposed OPEN \n     Government Act or 2005, which will strengthen the federal \n     Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and advance government \n     openness.\n       James Madison once observed that ``[k]nowledge will forever \n     govern ignorance; and a people who mean to be their own \n     governors must arm themselves with the power which knowledge \n     gives.'' The Father of the Constitution recognized that our \n     constitutional democracy, which is rooted in self-government, \n     requires the informed consent of the people. I share \n     Madison's belief, and yours, that a government of the people, \n     by the people, and for the people must operate in full view \n     of the people. Openness and accountability--not secrecy and \n     concealment--are what keep democracies strong and enduring.\n       A commitment to open government underpins both FOIA and the \n     Texas Public Information Act, which you interpreted and \n     forcefully defended as the 49th Attorney General of Texas. As \n     your successor I am proud that Texas leads the nation in \n     promoting open government and privileged to build upon your \n     efforts to make sure the public's business is conducted in \n     full sunshine. As you know, the Texas Public Information Act \n     declares that ``government is the servant and not the master \n     of the people,'' and ``[t]he people do not give their public \n     servants the right to decide what is good for the people to \n     know and what is not good for them to know.''\n       The OPEN Government Act of 2005 will bring similar benefits \n     to all Americans and ensure that FOIA finally lives up to its \n     noble ideals. By closing loopholes and enabling government to \n     be more responsive to requests for information, the OPEN \n     Govermnent Act of 2005 will modernize FOIA's nearly 40-year-\n     old commitment to open and accessible government.\n       Our system of self-government does not rest on the public's \n     need to know, but on its fundamental right to know. Your \n     proposed legislation will codify this venerable standard in \n     federal law and reinforce one of our nation's first \n     principles: open government leads inexorably to good \n     government.\n       I cannot overstate my support for these important reforms \n     and commend you for your exceptional leadership on this \n     issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Greg Abbott,\n     Attorney General of Texas.\n                                  ____\n\n                            American Association of Law Libraries,\n\n\n                                    Washington Affairs Office,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 14, 2005.\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: On behalf of the American Association \n     of Law Libraries, I commend you for your leadership in \n     promoting access to government information by introducing the \n     Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National (OPEN) \n     Government Act of 2005. We share your belief that accessible \n     government information is both an essential principle of a \n     democratic society and a valuable public good.\n       The American Association of Law Libraries (AALL) is a \n     nonprofit educational organization with over 5000 members \n     nationwide who respond to the legal information needs of \n     legislators, judges, and other public officials at all levels \n     of government, corporations and small businesses, law \n     professors and students, attorneys, and members of the \n     general public. Our mission is to promote and enhance the \n     value of law libraries, to foster law librarianship and to \n     provide leadership and advocacy in the field of legal \n     information and information policy.\n       AALL believes that public inspection of government records, \n     including electronic records, under the Freedom of \n     Information Act (FOIA) is the foundation for citizen access \n     to government information. The OPEN Government Act of 2005 \n     provides important and timely amendments to FOIA. AALL \n     supports this important legislation and we look forward to \n     working with you to ensure its prompt enactment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Mary Alice Baish,\n     Associate Washington Affairs Representative.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               American Civil Liberties Union,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 14, 2005.\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Cornyn and Leahy: On behalf of the American \n     Civil Liberties Union and its more than 400,000 members, we \n     are pleased to endorse the Openness Promotes Effectiveness in \n     our National Government Act of 2005, the ``OPEN Government \n     Act of 2005.''\n       As the Supreme Court has made clear, ``disclosure, not \n     secrecy, is the dominant objective of the Act,'' Department \n     of the Air Force v. Rose, 425 U.S. 352 (1976). Nevertheless, \n     secrecy, not openness, all too often seems to be the dominant \n     trend of agencies in recent times.\n       The OPEN Government Act includes a series of much-needed \n     corrections to policies that have eroded the promise of the \n     Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). These include ensuring \n     requesters will have timely information on the status of \n     their requests, enforceable time limits for agencies to \n     respond to requests, news media status rules that recognize \n     the reality of freelance journalists and the Internet, and \n     strong incentives--including both carrots and sticks--for \n     agency employees to improve FOIA compliance. The OPEN \n     Government Act also includes a much needed review of the new \n     exemption in the Homeland Security Act for critical \n     infrastructure information.\n       James Madison warned against ``a popular Government without \n     popular information,'' saying that ``a people who mean to be \n     their own Governors, must arm themselves with the power \n     knowledge gives.'' We strongly urge passage of the OPEN \n     Government Act\n\n[[Page S1523]]\n\n     of 2005 to help restore to the people some of that power.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Laura W. Murphy,\n                          Director, Washington Legislative Office.\n                                                 Timothy H. Edgar,\n     Legislative Counsel.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               American Society of\n\n\n                                            Newspaper Editors,\n\n                                     Reston, VA, February 9, 2005.\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: On behalf of the American Society of \n     Newspaper Editors (ASNE), I am writing to congratulate you on \n     the Introduction of the ``Open Government Act.'' Since the \n     organization was founded in 1922, ASNE's membership of \n     directing editors of dally newspapers throughout the United \n     States has worked to assist journalists and provide an \n     unfettered and effective press in the service of the American \n     people.\n       ASNE is proud to endorse the Open Government Act as \n     legislation that can help us achieve these ideals. As you \n     wrote in your recent article in the LBJ Journal of Public \n     Affairs, ``Our national commitment to democracy and freedom \n     is not merely some abstract notion. It is a very real and \n     continuing effort, and an essential element of that effort is \n     an open and accessible government'' The Open Government Act \n     is a ringing reminder that the Freedom of Information Act \n     (FOIA) is the cornerstone of this principle. Your bill comes \n     at a time when many executive agencies are able to shortcut \n     FOIA's guarantees of access to government documents while \n     avoiding any repercussion for their actions.\n       We appreciate your desire to provide a meaningful \n     enforcement mechanism for those who see that FOIA is not \n     achieving its promise of open and accessible records for all. \n     The bill's pragmatic focus on procedural, rather than \n     substantive, change is noteworthy; instead of rewriting the \n     law in a way that would promote or disfavor certain special \n     interests, you wisely seek to bring government and citizenry \n     together to make FOIA more efficient and effective.\n       ASNE applauds your efforts and joins you in urging passage \n     of this bill in the 109th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Karla Garrett Harshaw,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Federation of American Scientists,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 4, 2005.\n     Senator John Cornyn,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: I am writing to express the support of \n     the Federation of American Scientists for your continuing \n     efforts to promote openness in government, and specifically \n     for your proposed legislation to strengthen the Freedom of \n     Information Act (FOIA).\n       It is our belief that openness generally, and the FOIA in \n     particular, have an importance that transcends the usual \n     political divides. By making information available to our \n     citizens, we advance the ideals of democratic self-governance \n     that we all share.\n       Your proposed legislation would strengthen the FOIA in \n     several important ways: It would reverse recent trends to use \n     fee recovery as an impediment to FOIA processing; it would \n     strengthen the position of requesters who are forced to \n     pursue litigation to gain the records they seek; it would \n     enhance and clarify the administration of the FOIA; and it \n     would create an important new mechanism to audit agency \n     compliance with the FOIA, among other important provisions.\n       Perhaps most fundamentally, your legislation marks a \n     hopeful new resurgence of congressional attention to these \n     fundamental issues.\n       Thank you for your leadership.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Steven Aftergood,\n\n                                                 Project Director,\n     FAS Project on Government Secrecy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     Free Congress Foundation,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 11, 2005.\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: We would like to commend your \n     introduction of the OPEN Government Act of 2005.\n       Conservatives believe checks and balances are essential to \n     our system of government. One important check is to ensure \n     that citizens and the news media have access to what the \n     Federal Government's departments and agencies are doing. \n     Unfortunately, as noted by Austin American Statesman reporter \n     Chuck Lindell, too often the Federal Government's bureaucracy \n     demonstrates no interest in replying to such requests in a \n     timely and efficient manner. It prefers to operate in \n     darkness, not having their actions exposed to the sunlight of \n     public scrutiny.\n       Citizens have a right to know what the Federal Government \n     is doing with their tax dollars. The fact that the Department \n     of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency can \n     take years to answer requests for information should be \n     disturbing to conservatives who bemoan the arrogance and \n     unresponsiveness of Big Government. Every citizen and every \n     news reporter is entitled to a prompt answer to their request \n     for information.\n       ``The buck stops here'' is a snappy soundbite, and may have \n     once represented a workable philosophy of governing in \n     simpler times. The reality is that in today's Washington it's \n     hard to tell where the buck is because it is simply obscured \n     by an unresponsive bureaucracy. Ironically, technology and \n     increasing expectations of transparency in government render \n     the mindset practiced by a recalcitrant bureaucracy obsolete. \n     A measure such as the OPEN Government Act of 2005 can help \n     level the playing field in favor of the citizenry.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Steve Lilienthal,\n\n                                                         Director,\n     Center for Privacy & Technology Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        The Freedom of Information\n\n\n                                          Foundation of Texas,\n\n                                     Dallas, TX, February 8, 2005.\n     Ms. Katherine Garner,\n     Executive Director.\n       Dear Board Members: United States Senator John Cornyn will \n     introduce legislation to strengthen the Freedom of \n     Information Act next week. Among other things, the Open \n     Government Act of 2005 would provide meaningful deadlines for \n     federal agencies to act on Freedom of Information requests \n     and impose consequences on federal agencies for missing \n     statutory deadlines. In light of the fact that some federal \n     agencies have had requests for information pending for as \n     long as seventeen years, the Foundation believes Senator \n     Cornyn's proposals are much needed and overdue. The proposed \n     legislation would also make it easier for successful \n     litigants to recover their attorney's fees when litigation \n     becomes necessary, strengthen reporting requirements on \n     government agencies' FOIA compliance, establish an ombudsman \n     to resolve FOIA complaints without the need to resort to \n     litigation and enhance the authority of the Office of Special \n     Counsel to take disciplinary action against government \n     officials who arbitrarily and capriciously deny disclosure.\n       The Foundation therefore enthusiastically endorses Senator \n     Cornyn's proposed legislation and encourages each of your \n     organizations to do the same.\n           Sincerely,\n     Joel R. White.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          The Heritage Foundation,\n\n\n                           Center for Media and Public Policy,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 11, 2005.\n     Sen. John Cornyn,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: Insuring the continuance of our \n     Republican liberty depends upon maintaining the right of the \n     people to know as much as possible about what their \n     government is doing in order to hold the public officials and \n     employees accountable.\n       Protecting this accountability tool grows ever more \n     important as the power of the federal government continues \n     its historic growth, with its attendant tendency continually \n     to become more and more resistant to genuine transparency. \n     That is why a healthy Freedom of Information Act is so vital.\n       But while the federal government has grown exponentially \n     since passage of the FOIA in 1966, the law's effectiveness \n     has steadily declined as politicians and career bureaucrats \n     with a shared interest in avoiding accountability have become \n     increasingly skilled at exploiting loopholes, creatively \n     interpreting administrative provisions and relying upon the \n     paucity of legal resources available to many requestors to \n     avoid satisfying either the letter or spirit of the statute.\n       Indeed, the National Security Archive's 2003 survey that \n     found an FOIA system ``in extreme disarray.'' The Archive \n     found that ``agency contact information on the web was often \n     inaccurate; response times largely failed to meet the \n     statutory standard; only a few agencies performed thorough \n     searches, including e-mail and meeting notes; and the lack of \n     central accountability at the agencies resulted in lost \n     requests and inability to track progress.''\n       I believe the comprehensive package of reforms contained in \n     ``The Open Government Act of 2005'' would go far in restoring \n     the effectiveness of the FOIA as an accountability tool for \n     the people in dealing with their government.\n       We must remember that transparency and accountability are \n     the strongest antidotes to the inevitable abuses of Big \n     Government and are thus essential guarantors of every \n     individual's liberty and prerequisites for the maintenance of \n     our common security.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Mark Tapscott,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                   National Newspaper Association,\n\n\n                                          Washington Programs,\n\n                                  Arlington, VA, February 9, 2005.\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: The National Newspaper Association, an \n     organization representing over 2,500 community newspapers \n     nationwide, supports your efforts to strengthen the Freedom \n     of Information Act. The OPEN Government Act of 2005 is a \n     sound step toward a better FOIA.\n       Openness and transparency in government is vital to the \n     proper functioning of a democratic government. Ensuring \n     unhindered access to government information by the public is \n     the utmost responsibility of our elected leaders, for without \n     this access, it would be impossible for the consent of the \n     governed to be truly informed.\n       The Freedom of Information Act is an important tool in \n     achieving this lofty goal, and\n\n[[Page S1524]]\n\n     it has proven to be useful to community newspapers around the \n     country. The Act requires continual oversight from Congress \n     to ensure the spirit of the law remains intact. Congress has \n     neglected this duty in recent years, and we are pleased that \n     you have undertaken efforts to rectify this neglect.\n       We want to emphasize that FOIA serves a function beyond \n     providing records to requesters filing written requests. It \n     also serves as a talisman for openness in similar state laws. \n     It provides a framework for releasing information that is \n     informally requested by journalists and others--a function of \n     particular importance to community newspapers.\n       We will look forward to working with you as the bill is \n     considered by the Judiciary Committee.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Matthew Paxton,\n\n                                                         Chairman,\n     Government Relations Committee.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             Newspaper Association of America,\n\n                                    Vienna, VA, February 10, 2005.\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, \n         Civil Rights, & Property Rights, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: On behalf of the Newspaper Association \n     of America (NAA), a non-profit organization representing more \n     than 2,000 newspapers in the United States and Canada, I want \n     to thank you for introducing the Open Government Act of 2005.\n       The Freedom of Information Act is premised on the belief \n     that an informed citizenry is essential to democracy. The \n     Open Government Act will strengthen the Freedom of \n     Information Act and send a clear message that the openness \n     and accessibility of the federal government is a vital part \n     of our democratic process.\n       We commend you for your outstanding leadership, especially \n     with regard to the inclusion of the provisions that would \n     close current FOIA loopholes, prevent new ones, and restore \n     meaningful deadlines for agency action on FOIA requests. \n     Additionally, the legislation will make it easier for the \n     public to access information about their government through \n     the creation of a FOlA ombudsmen, agency FOIA hotlines, and \n     tracking systems for FOIA requests.\n       Thank you again for your leadership on this important \n     issue. We look forward to working with you and your staff in \n     the coming months to ensure passage of the Open Government \n     Act of 2005 in the 109th Congress.\n           Thanks for reading,\n                                                    John F. Sturm,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  People for the American Way,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 9, 2005.\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Cornyn and Leahy: On behalf of People For the \n     American Way (PFAW) and its more than 675,000 members and \n     supporters, I write in support of your efforts to strengthen \n     the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and promote greater \n     public access to government records through the proposed Open \n     Government Act of 2005 (OGA).\n       Open government is a vital component of this country's \n     democratic framework, allowing citizens to learn about the \n     activities of their government and helping ensure government \n     accountability. FOIA, which permits public access to federal \n     records, has helped establish the public's right to obtain \n     government information and created a strong presumption in \n     favor of disclosure. Serious problems have arisen with full \n     and timely agency compliance with FOIA and its goals, \n     however, necessitating the types of important FOIA reforms \n     contemplated in the OGA.\n       In particular, PFAW is supportive of the Act's use of \n     penalties to enforce compliance with FOIA deadlines, \n     particularly the provision imposing a presumptive waiver of \n     FOIA exemptions when an agency fails to meet the 20-day \n     production deadline, and the requirement that Congress be \n     explicit when it considers creating additional exemptions \n     under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3).\n       We also support the provision in the bill that would permit \n     an award of attorney fees when a nonfrivolous lawsuit has \n     served as the catalyst for voluntary disclosure of a \n     substantial part of a FOIA request. It is imperative that a \n     requester--who must incur litigation costs to enforce agency \n     compliance with the law--be able to recover attorneys' fees \n     and litigation costs in such cases, particularly in order to \n     discourage arbitrary and unlawful agency rejections of \n     legitimate FOIA requests.\n       Finally, we believe that the various recordkeeping and \n     monitoring provisions of the Open Government Act--including \n     monitoring of the Department of Homeland Security's use of \n     its ``critical infrastructure information'' exemption and \n     mandatory agency disclosure of the 10 oldest active \n     requests--are useful and necessary to ensure the integrity of \n     the open government process and to gather the information \n     needed to modify and adjust our open government laws going \n     forward.\n       We applaud your efforts to reaffirm the vital importance of \n     open government in this country and believe that the Open \n     Government Act is an encouraging first step toward that goal.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Ralph G. Neas,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 394\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Openness Promotes \n     Effectiveness in our National Government Act of 2005'' or the \n     ``OPEN Government Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Freedom of Information Act was signed into law on \n     July 4, 1966, because the American people believe that--\n       (A) our constitutional democracy, our system of self-\n     government, and our commitment to popular sovereignty depends \n     upon the consent of the governed;\n       (B) such consent is not meaningful unless it is informed \n     consent; and\n       (C) as Justice Black noted in his concurring opinion in \n     Barr v. Matteo (360 U.S. 564 (1959)), ``The effective \n     functioning of a free government like ours depends largely on \n     the force of an informed public opinion. This calls for the \n     widest possible understanding of the quality of government \n     service rendered by all elective or appointed public \n     officials or employees.'';\n       (2) the American people firmly believe that our system of \n     government must itself be governed by a presumption of \n     openness;\n       (3) the Freedom of Information Act establishes a ``strong \n     presumption in favor of disclosure'' as noted by the United \n     States Supreme Court in United States Department of State v. \n     Ray (502 U.S. 164 (1991)), a presumption that applies to all \n     agencies governed by that Act;\n       (4) ``disclosure, not secrecy, is the dominant objective of \n     the Act,'' as noted by the United States Supreme Court in \n     Department of Air Force v. Rose (425 U.S. 352 (1976));\n       (5) in practice, the Freedom of Information Act has not \n     always lived up to the ideals of that Act; and\n       (6) Congress should regularly review section 552 of title \n     5, United States Code (commonly referred to as the Freedom of \n     Information Act), in order to determine whether further \n     changes and improvements are necessary to ensure that the \n     Government remains open and accessible to the American people \n     and is always based not upon the ``need to know'' but upon \n     the fundamental ``right to know''.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROTECTION OF FEE STATUS FOR NEWS MEDIA.\n\n       Section 552(a)(4)(A)(ii) of title 5, United States Code, is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``In making a determination of a representative of the news \n     media under subclause (II), an agency may not deny that \n     status solely on the basis of the absence of institutional \n     associations of the requester, but shall consider the prior \n     publication history of the requester. Prior publication \n     history shall include books, magazine and newspaper articles, \n     newsletters, television and radio broadcasts, and Internet \n     publications. If the requestor has no prior publication \n     history or current affiliation, the agency shall consider the \n     requestor's stated intent at the time the request is made to \n     distribute information to a reasonably broad audience.''.\n\n     SEC. 4. RECOVERY OF ATTORNEY FEES AND LITIGATION COSTS.\n\n       Section 552(a)(4)(E) of title 5, United States Code, is \n     amended by adding at the end the following: ``For purposes of \n     this section, a complainant has `substantially prevailed' if \n     the complainant has obtained a substantial part of its \n     requested relief through a judicial or administrative order \n     or an enforceable written agreement, or if the complainant's \n     pursuit of a nonfrivolous claim or defense has been a \n     catalyst for a voluntary or unilateral change in position by \n     the opposing party that provides a substantial part of the \n     requested relief.''.\n\n     SEC. 5.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join as a partner with the \nSenator from Texas in introducing the OPEN Government Act of 2005. I \nhave devoted a considerable portion of my work in the Senate to \nimproving Government oversight, Government openness and citizen \n``right-to-know'' laws to make Government work better for the American \npeople, and at times it has been a lonely battle. Finding dedicated \nallies on the other side of the aisle has proven difficult. That is why \nI am delighted to have a partner in John Cornyn. Senator Cornyn has a \ndistinguished record of supporting open government dating back to his \ndays as Attorney General of Texas. In fact,\n\n[[Page S1526]]\n\nsome of the provisions in the bill we introduce today are modeled after \nsections of the Texas Public Information Act.\n  I believe that we both see this effort as the first of many \nbipartisan steps we can take together in the new Congress. Senator \nCornyn and I began to forge a partnership on improving public access to \nGovernment information well over a year ago when, during the 108th \nCongress, we worked with several other Senators and with the Library of \nCongress to improve the publicly accessible congressional information \nwebsite, THOMAS. He and I also cooperated last fall in a successful \neffort to ensure that ``government information,'' including the \napplication of the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, be subject to the \njurisdiction of both the Judiciary Committee and the newly constituted \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  The bill we introduce today is a collection of commonsense \nmodifications designed to update FOIA and improve the timely processing \nof FOIA requests by Federal agencies. It was drafted after a long and \nthoughtful process of consultation with individuals and organizations \nthat rely on FOIA to obtain information and share it with the public, \nincluding the news media, librarians, and public interest organizations \nrepresenting all facets of the political spectrum.\n  The OPEN Government Act reaffirms the fundamental premise of FOIA: \nGovernment information belongs to all Americans and should be subject \nto a presumption in favor of disclosure. James Madison said that ``a \npopular government, without popular information, or the means of \nacquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce or tragedy or perhaps \nboth.'' His caution rings just as true today. The public's right to \nknow what its government is doing promotes accountability, imbues trust \nand contributes to our system of checks and balances.\n  First enacted in 1966, FOIA represents the foundation of our modern \nopen Government laws. In 1996, I was the principal author of the \nElectronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments, which updated FOIA \nfor the internet age. The bill we introduce today is the next step: a \npractical set of important modifications that respond to common \ncomplaints and limitations in the current system that we have heard, \nwhether from frequent FOIA requestors, such as representatives of the \npress, or individual citizens who may only occasionally rely on FOIA, \nbut who nonetheless deserve timely and comprehensive responses to their \nrequests.\n  Chief among the problems with FOIA implementation is agency delay. \nFollowing the successful model of the Texas Public Information Act, \nthis legislation imposes penalties on agencies that miss statutory \ndeadlines to release documents and strengthens reporting requirements \non FOIA compliance.\n  The OPEN Government Act responds to some confusion over the \napplicability of FOIA to agency records that are held by outside \nprivate contractors. It does this by clarifying that such records are \nsubject to FOIA wherever they are located.\n  Our legislation establishes an ombudsman to mediate FOIA disputes \nbetween agencies and requestors, a step that many FOIA requestors \nbelieve will help to ameliorate the need for FOIA litigation in the \nFederal courts. We hope that this mechanism will work to the benefit of \nall parties. However, where mediation fails to resolve disputes, our \nbill preserves the rights of requestors to litigate under FOIA.\n  Our bill responds to recent Federal jurisprudence by explicitly \nproviding for recovery of attorneys' fees under the so-called \n``catalyst theory.'' That is, where a FOIA lawsuit was the catalyst for \nan agency determination to release documents prior to a court's entry \nof judgment, the plaintiff may recover attorneys' fees.\n  Finally, the bill requires reports on a controversial law, the \nCritical Infrastructure Information Act, enacted as part of the \nHomeland Security Act of 2002, and it protects fee-waiver status for \njournalists under FOIA.\n  Letters of support for the OPEN Government Act have been submitted by \nthe American Association of Law Libraries, American Civil Liberties \nUnion, American Library Association, American Society of Newspaper \nEditors, Associated Press Managing Editors, Association of Health Care \nJournalists, Center for Democracy & Technology, Coalition of \nJournalists for Open Government, Committee of Concerned Journalists, \nEducation Writers Association, Electronic Privacy Information Center, \nFederation of American Scientists/Project on Government Secrecy, Free \nCongress Foundation/Center for Privacy & Technology Policy, Freedom of \nInformation Center/University of Missouri, The Freedom of Information \nFoundation of Texas, The Heritage Foundation/Center for Media and \nPublic Policy, Information Trust, National Conference of Editorial \nWriters, National Freedom of Information Coalition, National Newspaper \nAssociation, National Security Archive/George Washington University, \nNewspaper Association of America, People for the American Way, Project \non Government Oversight, Radio-Television News Directors Association, \nThe Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, and the Society of \nEnvironmental Journalists.\n  The Freedom of Information Act is an invigorating mechanism that \nhelps keep our government more open and effective and closer to the \nAmerican people. FOIA has had serious setbacks in recent years that \nendanger its effectiveness. This legislation is a rare chance to \nadvance the public's right to know.\n  I thank my colleague, the Senator from Texas, for the time and effort \nhe has devoted to protecting the public's right to know, and I urge all \nmembers of the Senate to join us in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 395. A bill to amend the Buy American Act to increase the \nrequirement for American-made content, and to tighten the waiver \nprovisions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the second in a \nseries of bills intended to support American companies and American \nworkers. Yesterday, I submitted S. Con. Res. 12, which would set some \nminimum standards for future trade agreements into which our country \nenters.\n  The bill that I am introducing today, the Buy American Improvement \nAct, focuses on the Federal Government's responsibility to support \ndomestic manufacturers and workers and on the role of Federal \nprocurement policy in achieving this goal. The reintroduction of this \nbill, which I first introduced in 2003, is part of my ongoing effort to \nfind ways to stem the flow of manufacturing jobs abroad.\n  The Buy American Act of 1933 is the primary statute that governs \nFederal procurement. The name of this law accurately and succinctly \ndescribes its purpose: to ensure that the Federal Government supports \ndomestic companies and domestic workers by buying American-made goods. \nThis is an important law but, regrettably, it contains a number of \nloopholes that make it too easy for government agencies to buy foreign-\nmade goods.\n  My bill, the Buy American Improvement Act, would strengthen the \nexisting act by tightening its waiver provisions. Currently, the heads \nof Federal departments and agencies are given broad discretion to waive \nthe Act and buy foreign goods. We should ensure that the Federal \nGovernment makes every effort to give Federal contracts to companies \nthat will perform the work domestically. We should also ensure that \ncertain types of industries do not leave the United States completely, \nthus making the Federal Government dependent on foreign sources for \ngoods, such as plane or ship parts, that our military may need to \nacquire on short notice.\n  I have often heard my colleagues say on this floor that American-made \ngoods are the best in the world. I could not agree more. Regrettably, \nnearly 80,000 good-paying manufacturing jobs have left my state since \n2000. And the country has lost more than two-and-one-half million \nmanufacturing jobs since January 2001, including more than 25,000 jobs \nlast month alone. This hemorrhaging of jobs shows no signs of stopping. \nCongress should do more to support domestic manufacturers and their \nemployees. One way to do this is to ensure that the Federal Government \nmakes every effort to buy American-made goods.\n\n[[Page S1527]]\n\n  There are five primary waivers to the Buy American Act, and my bill \naddresses four of them The first of these waivers allows an agency head \nto buy foreign goods if complying with the Act would be ``inconsistent \nwith the public interest.'' I am concerned that this waiver, which \nincludes no definition for what is ``inconsistent with the public \ninterest,'' is actually a gaping loophole that gives too much \ndiscretion to department secretaries and agency heads. My bill would \nmodify this waiver provision to prohibit it from being invoked by an \nagency or department head after a request for proposals, or RFP, has \nbeen published in the Federal Register. Once the bidding process has \nbegun, the Federal Government should not be able to pull an RFP by \nsaying that it is in the ``public interest'' to do so. This \ndetermination, sometimes referred to as the Buy American Act's national \nsecurity waiver, should be made well in advance of placing a \nprocurement up for bid. To do otherwise pulls the rug out from under \ncompanies that are spending valuable time and resources to prepare a \nbid for a Federal contract.\n  The Buy American Act may also be waived if the head of the agency \ndetermines that the cost of the lowest-priced domestic product is \n``unreasonable,'' and a system of price differentials is used to assist \nin making this determination. My bill would modify this waiver to \nrequire that preference be given to the American company if that \ncompany's bid is substantially similar to the lowest foreign bid or if \nthe American company is the only domestic source for the item to be \nprocured.\n  I have a long record of supporting efforts to help taxpayers get the \nmost bang for their buck and of opposing wasteful Federal spending. I \ndon't think anyone can argue that supporting American jobs is \n``wasteful.'' We owe it to American manufacturers and their employees \nto make sure they get a fair shake. I would not support awarding a \ncontract to an American company that is price gouging, but we should \nmake every effort to ensure that domestic sources for goods needed by \nthe Federal Government do not dry up because American companies have \nbeen slightly underbid by foreign competitors.\n  The Buy American Act also includes a waiver for goods bought by the \nFederal Government that will be used outside of the United States. \nThere is no question that there are occasions when the Federal \nGovernment needs to procure items quickly for use outside the United \nStates, such as in a time of war. However, there may be items that are \nbought on a regular basis and used at foreign military bases or United \nStates embassies, for example, that could reasonably be procured from \ndomestic sources and shipped to the location where they will be used. \nMy bill would require Federal agencies to compare the difference in \ncost for obtaining articles that are used on regular basis outside the \nU.S., or that are not needed immediately, between an overseas versus a \ndomestic source--including the cost of shipping--before awarding the \ncontract to the company that will do the work overseas.\n  The Buy American Act's domestic source requirements may also be \nwaived if the articles to be procured are not available from domestic \nsources ``in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities \nand of a satisfactory quality.'' My bill would require that an agency \nor department head, prior to issuing such a waiver, determine whether \ndomestic production can be initiated to meet the procurement needs and \nwhether a comparable article, material, or supply is available \ndomestically.\n  My bill would also strengthen the Buy American Act in four other \nways. It would, for the first time, make the Buy American requirement \napplicable to the United States Congress. The current definition of a \nFederal agency in the Act specifically exempts the Senate, the House, \nand Architect of the Capitol, and activities under the direction of the \nArchitect. I believe that Congress should lead by example and comply \nwith the Buy American Act--a requirement that we have imposed on \nexecutive agencies.\n  Secondly, my bill would increase the minimum American content \nstandard qualification under the Act from the current 50 percent to 75 \npercent. The definition of what qualifies as an American-made product \nhas been a source of much debate. To me, it seems clear that American-\nmade means manufactured in this country. This classification is a \nsource of pride for manufacturing workers around our country. The \ncurrent 50 percent standard should be raised to a minimum of 75 \npercent.\n  In addition, my bill would make permanent the expanded reporting \nrequirement that I authored which was first enacted as part of the \nfiscal year 2004 omnibus spending bill and was extended as part of the \nfiscal year 2005 omnibus spending bill. Prior to the enactment of these \nprovisions, only the Department of Defense was required to report to \nCongress on its use of Buy American waivers and purchases of foreign \ngoods. It is virtually impossible to get hard numbers on the Federal \nGovernment's purchases of foreign- and domestic-made goods and to \nensure that there is disclosure and accountability in the waiver \nprocess.\n  The annual report to be submitted by agency heads will be required to \ninclude the following information: the dollar value of any items \npurchased that were manufactured outside of the United States; an \nitemized list of all applicable waivers granted with respect to such \nitems under the Buy American Act; and a summary of the total \nprocurement funds spent by the Federal agency on goods manufactured in \nthe United States versus on goods manufactured overseas. In addition, \nmy bill also requires that the heads of all Federal agencies make these \nannual reports publicly available on the Internet.\n  My bill also seeks to prevent dual-use technologies from falling into \nthe hands of terrorists or countries of concern by prohibiting the \nawarding of overseas contracts or sub-contracts that would require the \ntransfer of information relating to any item that is classified as a \ndual-use item on the Commerce Control List unless approval for such a \ncontract has been obtained through the Export Administration Act \nprocess. It only makes sense that we would not award contracts that \nrequire the transfer of sensitive technology without following our own \nexport licensing process. It is possible that this technology could \nlater be used by some countries to make their own products to sell to \ncountries that cannot obtain such goods from the United States. This \nloophole in our export control laws should be closed.\n\n  Finally, my bill would require the Government Accountability Office \nto report to Congress with recommendations for defining the terms \n``inconsistent with the public interest'' and ``unreasonable cost'' for \npurposes of invoking the corresponding waivers in the Act. I am \nconcerned that both of these terms lack definitions, and that they can \nbe very broadly interpreted by agency or department heads. GAO would \nrequire to make recommendations for statutory definitions of both of \nthese terms, as well as for establishing a consistent waiver process \nthat can be used by all federal agencies.\n  I am pleased that my legislation is supported by a broad array of \nbusiness and labor groups. The groups are committed to ensuring that we \nhave a strong domestic manufacturing base that provides good-paying, \nstable jobs for American workers, and they include Save American \nManufacturing, the national and Wisconsin AFL-CIO, the U.S. Business \nand Industry Council, the International Association of Machinists and \nAerospace Workers, the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, and \nthe United Auto Workers.\n  In addition to strengthening the Buy American Act, Congress should \nsupport trade agreements that do not undermine it. As I have repeatedly \nstated on this floor, Congress and Administrations of both parties have \na dismal record of promoting trade agreements that send American jobs \noverseas. And many of those same flawed trade agreements have \nrepeatedly weakened the Buy American Act and other domestic preference \nlaws.\n  Last year, the Ranking Member of the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, Mr. Lieberman, and I asked the GAO to \nstudy the effect of trade agreements on domestic source requirements \nsuch as those contained in the Buy American Act. That study found that \nthe United States government is required to give\n\n[[Page S1528]]\n\nfavorable treatment to certain goods from a total of 45 countries as a \nresult of trade agreements and reciprocal defense procurement \nagreements. The report notes that the United States is a party to seven \ntrade agreements, including the North American Free Trade Agreement \n(NAFTA) and the World Trade Organization's Government Procurement \nAgreement, that prevents the U.S. from applying domestic preference \nlaws fully. The report also identifies 21 Department of Defense (DoD) \nMemoranda of Understanding that allow DoD to procure goods and services \nfrom foreign countries.\n  The gaping loopholes in the Buy American Act and the trade agreements \nand defense procurement agreements that contain additional waivers of \ndomestic source restrictions have combined to weaken our domestic \nmanufacturing base by allowing--and sometimes actually encouraging--the \nFederal Government to buy foreign-made goods. Congress can and should \ndo more to support American companies and American workers. We must \nstrengthen the Buy American Act and we must stop entering into bad \ntrade agreements that send our jobs overseas and undermine our own \ndomestic preference laws.\n  By strengthening Federal procurement policy, we can help to bolster \nour domestic manufacturers during these difficult times. As I have \nrepeatedly noted, Congress cannot simply stand on the sidelines while \ntens of thousands of American manufacturing jobs have been and continue \nto be shipped overseas. While there may be no single solution to this \nproblem, I believe that one way in which Congress should act is by \nstrengthening the Buy American Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 395\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prohibit civil liability actions from being brought \nor continued against manufacturers, distributors, dealers, or importers \nof firearms or ammunition for damages, injunctive or other relief \nresulting from the misuse of their products by others; read the first \ntime.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Baucus in \nintroducing the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.\n  This bill addresses the abuse of our Nation's courts through \npredatory lawsuits against the U.S. firearms industry--suits attempting \nto force law-abiding businesses to pay far criminal acts by individuals \nbeyond their control.\n  It's important for our colleagues to understand that the lawsuits \nwe're talking about are not brought by victims seeing relief for same \nwrongs done to them by the firearms industry. Instead, they are part of \na politically inspired initiative trying to force social goals through \nan end-run around the Congress and State legislatures.\n  These lawsuits are based an the notion that even though a business \ncomplies with all laws and sells a legitimate product, it should be \nheld responsible for the misuse or illegal use of the firearm by a \ncriminal. This isn't a legal theory--it's just the latest twist in the \ngun controllers' notion that it's the gun, and not the criminal, that \ncauses crime.\n  The truth is that there are millions of firearms in this country \ntoday, only a tiny fraction of which have ever been used in the \ncommission of a crime. The truth is that again and again, law-abiding \nfirearm owners are using their guns, often without even firing a shot, \nto defend life and property. The truth is that the intent of the user, \nnot the gun, determines whether that gun will be used in a crime. The \ntrend of predatory litigation targeting the firearms industry not only \ndefies common sense and concepts of fundamental fairness, but it would \ndo nothing to curb criminal gun violence. The cost of these lawsuits \nthreatens to drive a critical industry out of business, losing \nthousands of good-paying jobs in the process and jeopardizing \nAmericans' constitutionally protected access to firearms for self \ndefense and other lawful uses.\n  The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act would stop these \nabusive lawsuits. However, it would not insulate the firearms industry \nfrom all lawsuits or deprive legitimate victims of their day in court. \nIndeed, it specifically provides that actions based on the wrongful \nconduct of those involved in the business of manufacturing and selling \nfirearms would not be affected by this legislation. The bill is solely \ndirected to stopping abusive, politically driven litigation against \nlaw-abiding individuals for the misbehavior of criminals over whom they \nhad no control.\n  This bill is virtually identical to legislation introduced and \ndebated to length in the Senate during the last Congress. As my \ncolleagues will recall, the addition of two unrelated poison pill \namendments doomed final passage of that bill; however, it is worth \nnoting that all amendments to the actual substance of that measure were \ndefeated.\n  The need for this legislation is every bit as serious today as it was \nin the last Congress. I am proud that a number of our colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle asked to sponsor this bill before it was even \nintroduced: Mr. Alexander, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Burns, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. \nCoburn, Ms. Collins, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Ensign, \nMr. Enzi, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Johnson, Mr. \nKyl, Mrs. Lincoln, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Santorum, \nMr. Sessions, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Thomas, and Mr. Thune. I \nthank these original cosponsors for their support.\n  The courts of our Nation are supposed to be forums for resolving \ncontroversies between citizens and providing relief where warranted, \nnot a mechanism for achieving political ends that are rejected by the \npeople's representatives in Congress and the State legislatures. I hope \nall our colleagues will join us in taking a measured, principled stand \nagainst this abusive litigation by supporting the Protection of Lawful \nCommerce in Arms Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 397\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Protection of Lawful \n     Commerce in Arms Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution \n     provides that the right of the people to keep and bear arms \n     shall not be infringed.\n       (2) The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution \n     protects the rights of individuals, including those who are \n     not members of a militia or engaged in military service or \n     training, to keep and bear arms.\n       (3) Lawsuits have been commenced against manufacturers, \n     distributors, dealers, and importers of firearms that operate \n     as designed and intended, which seek money damages and other \n     relief for the harm caused by the misuse of firearms by third \n     parties, including criminals.\n       (4) The manufacture, importation, possession, sale, and use \n     of firearms and ammunition in the United States are heavily \n     regulated by Federal, State, and local laws. Such Federal \n     laws include the Gun Control Act of 1968, the National \n     Firearms Act, and the Arms Export Control Act.\n       (5) Businesses in the United States that are engaged in \n     interstate and foreign commerce through the lawful design, \n     manufacture, marketing, distribution, importation, or sale to \n     the public of firearms or ammunition products that have been \n     shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce are \n     not, and should not, be liable for the harm caused by those \n     who criminally or unlawfully misuse firearm products or \n     ammunition products that function as designed and intended.\n       (6) The possibility of imposing liability on an entire \n     industry for harm that is solely caused by others is an abuse \n     of the legal system, erodes public confidence in our Nation's \n     laws, threatens the diminution of a basic constitutional \n     right and civil liberty, invites the disassembly and \n     destabilization of other industries and economic sectors \n     lawfully competing in the free enterprise system of the \n     United States, and constitutes an unreasonable burden on \n     interstate and foreign commerce of the United States.\n       (7) The liability actions commenced or contemplated by the \n     Federal Government, States, municipalities, and private \n     interest groups and others are based on theories without \n     foundation in hundreds of years of the common law and \n     jurisprudence of the United States and do not represent a \n     bona fide expansion of the common law. The possible \n     sustaining of these actions by a maverick judicial officer or \n     petit jury would expand civil liability in a manner never \n     contemplated by the framers of the Constitution, by Congress, \n     or by the legislatures of the several States. Such an \n     expansion of liability would constitute a deprivation of the \n     rights, privileges, and immunities guaranteed to a citizen of \n     the United States under the Fourteenth Amendment to the \n     United States Constitution.\n       (8) The liability actions commenced or contemplated by the \n     Federal Government, States, municipalities, private interest \n     groups and others attempt to use the judicial branch to \n     circumvent the Legislative branch of government to regulate \n     interstate and foreign commerce through judgments and \n     judicial decrees thereby threatening the Separation of Powers \n     doctrine and weakening and undermining important principles \n     of federalism, State sovereignty and comity between the \n     sister States.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To prohibit causes of action against manufacturers, \n     distributors, dealers, and importers of firearms or \n     ammunition products, and their trade associations, for the \n     harm solely caused by the criminal or unlawful misuse of \n     firearm products or ammunition products by others when the \n     product functioned as designed and intended.\n       (2) To preserve a citizen's access to a supply of firearms \n     and ammunition for all lawful purposes, including hunting, \n     self-defense, collecting, and competitive or recreational \n     shooting.\n       (3) To guarantee a citizen's rights, privileges, and \n     immunities, as applied to the States, under the Fourteenth \n     Amendment to the United States Constitution, pursuant to \n     section 5 of that Amendment.\n       (4) To prevent the use of such lawsuits to impose \n     unreasonable burdens on interstate and foreign commerce.\n       (5) To protect the right, under the First Amendment to the \n     Constitution, of manufacturers, distributors, dealers, and \n     importers of firearms or ammunition products, and trade \n     associations, to speak freely, to assemble peaceably, and to \n     petition the Government for a redress of their grievances.\n       (6) To preserve and protect the Separation of Powers \n     doctrine and important principles of federalism, State \n     sovereignty and comity between sister States.\n       (7) To exercise congressional power under art. IV, section \n     1 (the Full Faith and Credit Clause) of the United States \n     Constitution.\n\n[[Page S1530]]\n\n     SEC. 3.

I urge all my colleagues to join Senator Bayh and me \nas supporters of this legislation and ask that they actively work with \nus towards its enactment.\n  The United States Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, defines \nbrownfields as ``abandoned, idled, or under used industrial commercial \nsites where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by real or \nperceived environmental contamination that can add cost, time, or \nuncertainness to redevelopment projects.''\n  Brownfields are not unique to my State of Pennsylvania, nor are they \nto Senator Bayh's State of Indiana. In every State in the Nation, there \nare areas blighted by run down, abandoned properties and unsightly \nvacant lots. They are the shut down manufacturing facilities, deserted \nwarehouses and gas stations that are all too familiar to us. On these \nproperties once stood vibrant and productive enterprises, but changing \ntimes and events have drained their vitality and they are now in \ndesperate need of revitalization and redevelopment. Compounding the \nproblem is that over the years, the activities on these sites have left \nthe soil and water tables contaminated with environmental pollutants.\n  The negative social and economic effects that these sites cause on \ntheir surrounding communities are significant. There are serious \nfinancial impacts not only to the market values of the brownfield \nproperties themselves, but also to property values in the surrounding \nneighborhoods. As middle class citizens are working to gain assets and \npotentially be able to borrow against, or even sell their homes in the \nfuture, property values become a very serious issue. A reduction of \nproperty values in brownfield neighborhoods hits hardest the families \nwho can least afford it.\n  Brownfields have other serious repercussions, extending far beyond \nthe pocketbook. The unsightliness of brownfields can lead to the \ncharacterization of entire neighborhoods as run-down and undesirable. \nThe once vibrant spirit of these centrally located and thriving urban \nareas can be dampened as these eyesores drag down residents' morale and \nsense of connection with their community.\n  The U.S. Conference of Mayors and the Government Accountability \nOffice estimate that there are over 400,000 brownfield sites across the \ncountry. According to a recent U.S. Conference of Mayors survey of 187 \ncities throughout the nation, redevelopment of their existing \nbrownfields would bring additional tax revenues of up to $2 billion \nannually and could create hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n\n[[Page S1531]]\n\n  Many brownfields are located in prime business locations near \ncritical infrastructure, including transportation, and close to an \nalready productive workforce. Putting these sites back into use will \ngenerate good paying jobs and affordable housing in areas where they \nare most needed. Rehabilitating and reusing these sites also serves to \nhelp prevent urban sprawl. We should encourage the cleanup and use of \nthese brownfield sites rather than abandon them and instead always look \nto develop at new locations. A powerful example from my State of a \nsuccessful brownfield revitalization effort and how it can have \nsubstantial and positive effects on a community is the city of Chester.\n  In the midst of a major revitalization, Chester is redeveloping its \nblighted and vacant waterfront district, including the former PECO \npower station. The city is striving to turn a former industrial site \ninto a business center. Chester will be able to create new office \nspace, and by working with a private developer Chester has received an \ninitial commitment to move 2,000 jobs into the area. This initiative \nwill help bring more business and infrastructure back to the community, \nadding to the area's prosperity and making Chester an even safer and \nmore pleasant place to live.\n  Unfortunately, a big reason that so many brownfield properties are \nlanguishing in a state of decay and disrepair is the substantial clean \nup costs associated with them and the unfavorable tax treatment of \nthose costs.\n  As part of the Community Renewal and Revitalization Act of 2000, \nCongress enacted section 198 of the Internal Revenue Code, which \nallowed cleanup costs to be expensed in the year they were incurred. \nPrior to that, these costs had to be capitalized to the land, \npostponing any recovery of these costs for tax purposes until the \nproperty was sold.\n  This expedited writeoff of clean up expenses helps a redeveloper \nmanage the cost of rehabilitating existing properties which typically \nis much more expensive than developing new sites. Brownfield cleanup \ncosts can be an imposing obstacle to redevelopment. While the price tag \nvaries with each site, it is not unreasonable for the cleanup of a \nmajor site to cost between $500,000 and $1 million.\n  We in the Senate, and our colleagues in the House, were wise to enact \nsection 198 and renew it for 2 years through the Working Families Tax \nRelief Act of 2004. That was a start, but more needs to be done in this \narea.\n  The bill my colleague and I are introducing today has three \nprovisions. First, it makes section 198 a permanent provision in the \nTax Code. Second, it broadens the definition of ``hazardous \nsubstances'' in section 198 to include petroleum. Finally, it repeals \nthe provision in the law requiring the recapture of the section 198 \ndeduction when the property is sold.\n  The tax policy of allowing the expensing of clean up costs should be \na permanent fixture in the Tax Code. Brownfields are a long-term \nproblem and this solution will allow us to complete this important \ntask.\n  Furthermore, a shortcoming of the law passed in 2000 was the absence \nof petroleum as a contaminant that allowed a site to qualify as a \nbrownfield under section 198. A large percentage of brownfields across \nthe country are contaminated with petroleum. Extending the law to cover \npetroleum contamination makes much more sense and the law much more \neffective.\n  Finally, the provision in section 198 that requires a taxpayer who \nuses the clean up deduction to pay income tax on that amount when he or \nshe sells the property is illogical. This sends a message to \ndevelopers, that if they undertake the worthy endeavor of remediation \nof brownfield sites they will be subjected to substantial tax penalties \nfor doing so. This policy is counterproductive to the efforts we are \ntrying to encourage and it should be repealed.\n  The benefits of brownfields cleanup are obvious. Remediation of these \nsites revitalizes our neighborhoods and communities, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COLEMAN (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 399. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with \nrespect to the sale of prescription drugs through the Internet, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COLEMAN:\n  S. 400. A bill to prevent the illegal importation of controlled \nsubstances; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce two bills that expand \nFederal authority to prevent controlled substances from flooding into \nthe U.S., authorizing States to shut down illegitimate virtual \npharmacies, and bar Internet drug stores from dispensing drugs to \ncustomers referred to on-line doctors for a prescription.\n  Americans are increasingly turning to the Internet for access to \naffordable drugs. In 2003, consumer spending on drugs procured over the \nInternet exceeded $3.2 billion. Unfortunately, rogue Internet sites \nhave proliferated and rake in millions of dollars by selling unproven, \ncounterfeit, defective or otherwise inappropriate medications to \nunsuspecting consumers. Even more dangerously, these sites are \nprofiting by selling addictive and potentially deadly controlled \nsubstances to consumers without a prescription or any physician \noversight. This must stop before more individuals die or become \naddicted to easily obtainable narcotic drugs.\n  The first bill I am introducing was developed in close consultation \nwith Senator Feinstein, who is an original cosponsor. In appreciation \nfor her role in helping write this legislation it is named after a \nyoung man from her state who died from an overdose of drugs purchased \nover the Internet. I am also pleased to announce that Congressmen Tom \nDavis and Henry Waxman are introducing this exact measure in the House \ntoday. The issue of rogue Internet sites and the availability of \ncontrolled substances on-line is indeed a bi-partisan and bi-cameral \nissue.\n  17-year-old Ryan Haight of La Mesa, CA was an honor roll student, and \navid baseball card collector about to enter college. As his mom says, \n``he was a good kid.'' But in May of 2000 Ryan started hanging out with \na different crowd of friends. He joined an online chat forum, which \nadvocates the safe use of drugs, and he began buying prescription drugs \nfrom the Internet.\n  He used the family computer late at night and a debit card his \nparents gave him to buy baseball cards on Ebay. You might wonder how \ndid a healthy 17-year-old obtain prescriptions for painkillers without \na medical exam. He got them from Dr. Robert Ogle an ``online'' \nphysician based out of Texas. With the prescriptions from Dr. Ogle, \nRyan was able to order hydrocodone, morphine, Valium and Oxazepam and \nhave them shipped via US mail right to his front door.\n  In February 2001, Ryan overdosed on a combination of these \nprescription drugs. His mother found him dead on his bedroom floor.\n  The Ryan Haight Internet Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act counters \nthe growing sale of prescription drugs over the Internet without a \nvalid prescription by one, providing new disclosure standards for \nInternet pharmacies; two, barring Internet sites from selling or \ndispensing prescription drugs to consumers who are provided a \nprescription solely on the basis of an online questionnaire; and three, \nallowing State Attorneys General to go to Federal court to shut down \nrogue sites.\n  The bill is geared to counter domestic Internet pharmacies that sell \ndrugs without a valid prescription, not international pharmacies that \nsell drugs at a low cost to individuals who have a valid prescription \nfrom their U.S. doctors.\n  Under current law, purchasing drugs online without a valid \nprescription can be simple: a consumer just types the name of the drug \ninto a search engine, quickly identifies a site selling the medication, \nfills in a brief questionnaire, and then clicks to purchase. The risks \nof self-medicating, however, can include potential adverse reactions \nfrom inappropriately prescribed medications, dangerous drug \ninteractions, use of counterfeit or tainted products, and addiction to \nhabit-forming substances. Several of these illegitimate sites fail to \nprovide information about contraindications, potential adverse effects, \nand efficacy.\n  Regulating these Internet pharmacies is difficult for Federal and\n\n[[Page S1532]]\n\nState authorities. State medical and pharmacy boards have expressed the \nconcern that they do not have adequate enforcement tools to regulate \npractice over the Internet. It can be virtually impossible for states \nto identify, investigate, and prosecute these illegal pharmacies \nbecause the consumer, prescriber, and seller of a drug may be located \nin different States.\n  The Internet Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act amends the Federal \nFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to address this problem in three steps. \nFirst, it requires Internet pharmacy web sites to display information \nidentifying the business, pharmacist, and physician associated with the \nwebsite.\n  Second, the bill bars the selling or dispensing of a prescription \ndrug via the Internet when the website has referred the customer to a \ndoctor who then writes a prescription without ever seeing the patient.\n  Third, the bill provides States with new enforcement authority \nmodeled on the Federal Telemarketing Sales Act that will allow a State \nattorney general to shut down a rogue site across the country, rather \nthan only bar sales to consumers of his or her State.\n  I am proud to say that the Ryan Haight Internet Pharmacy Consumer \nProtection Act is supported by the Federation of State Medical Boards, \nthe National Community Pharmacists Association, and the American \nPharmacists Association.\n  The second bill I am introducing enables Customs and Border \nProtection to immediately seize and destroy any package containing a \ncontrolled substance that is illegally imported into the U.S. without \nhaving to fill out duplicative forms and other unnecessary \nadministrative paperwork. The Act will allow Customs to focus on \ninterdicting and destroying potentially addictive and deadly controlled \nsubstances. The Act is dedicated to Todd Rode, a young man who died \nafter overdosing on imported drugs.\n  Todd Rode had the heart and soul of a musician. He graduated from \ncollege magna cum laude with a major in psychology and a minor in \nmusic. The faculty named him the outstanding senior in the Psychology \nDepartment. He worked in this field for a number of years, but he \nconstantly fought bouts of depression and anxiety.\n  Unfortunately Todd ordered controlled drugs from a pharmacy and \ndoctor in another country. These drugs included Venlafaxine, \nPropoxyphene, and Codeine. All were controlled substances and all were \nobtained from overseas pharmacies without any safeguards. To obtain \nthese controlled substances all Todd had to do was to fill out an \nonline questionnaire and with the click of a mouse they were shipped \ndirectly to his front door.\n  In October of 1999, Todd's family found him dead in his apartment.\n  A six-month investigation by the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations has revealed that tens of thousands of dangerous and \naddictive controlled substances are streaming into the U.S. on a daily \nbasis from overseas Internet pharmacies. For example, on March 15 and \n17, 2004, at JFK airport, home to the largest International Mail Branch \nin the U.S., at least 3000 boxes from a single vendor in the \nNetherlands containing hydrocodone and Diazepam (Valium) were seized by \nCustoms and Border Protection (Customs).\n  In fact, senior Customs inspectors at JFK estimate that 40,000 \nparcels containing drugs are imported on a daily basis. During last \nsummer's FDN Customs blitz, 28 percent of the drugs tested were \ncontrolled substances. Extrapolating these figures, 11,200 drug parcels \ncontaining controlled substances are imported through JFK daily, 78,400 \nweekly, 313,600 monthly and 3,763,200 annually. Top countries of origin \ninclude Brazil, India, Pakistan, Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Canada, \nMexico, and Romania.\n  Likewise, as of March 2003, senior Customs officials at the Miami \nInternational Airport indicated that as much as 30,000 packages \ncontaining drugs were being imported on a daily basis. A large \npercentage of these are controlled substances as well. Customs is \nsimply overwhelmed. At Mail facilities across the U.S., Customs \nregularly seizes shipments of oxycodone, hydroquinone, tranquilizers, \nsteroids, codeine laced product, GHB, date rape drug, and morphine.\n  In order to comply with paperwork requirements, Customs is forced to \ndevote investigators solely to opening, counting, and analyzing drug \npackages, filling out duplicative forms, and logging into a computer \nall of the seized controlled substances. It takes Customs at least one \nhour to process a single shipment of a controlled substance. This \nminimizes the availability of inspectors to screen incoming drug \npackages. In fact, last year at JFK, there were as many as 20,000 \npackages of seized controlled substances waiting processing. Customs \nacknowledges that, because of the sheer volume of product, bureaucratic \nregulations, and lack of manpower, the vast majority of controlled \nsubstances that are illegally imported are simply missed and allowed \ninto the U.S. stream of commerce.\n  The Act to Prevent the Illegal Importation of Controlled Substances \nis a simple bill to address this burgeoning and potentially lethal \nproblem.\n  I am confident that, if enacted as stand-alone measures, each of \nthese bills will make on-line drug purchasing safer. However, I have \nworked with Senator Gregg to ensure these safety features are included \nin his comprehensive reimportation bill and urge my colleagues to help \nmake sure that this important piece of legislation becomes law this \nyear.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bills was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 399\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Coleman \nagain this year to re-introduce the Ryan Haight Internet Pharmacy \nConsumer Protection Act. Our legislation will protect the safety of \nAmericans who choose to purchase their prescription drugs legally over \nthe Internet.\n  This legislation is necessary because of a growing problem of illegal \nprescription drug diversion and abuse of prescription drugs. Coupled \nwith the ease of access to the Internet, it has led to an environment \nwhere illegitimate pharmacy websites can bypass traditional regulations \nand established safeguards for the sale of prescription drugs. Internet \nwebsites that allow consumers to obtain prescriptions drugs without the \nexistence of a bona fide physician-patient relationship pose an \nimmediate threat to public health and safety.\n  To address this problem, the Internet Pharmacy Consumer Protection \nAct makes several critical steps, to ensure safety and to assist \nregulatory authorities in shutting down ``rogue'' Internet pharmacies.\n  First, this bill establishes disclosure standards for Internet \npharmacies.\n  Second, this bill prohibits the dispensing or sale of a prescription \ndrug based solely on communications via the Internet such as the \ncompletion of an online medical questionnaire.\n  Third, it allows a State Attorney General to bring a civil action in \na Federal district court to enjoin a pharmacy operation and to enforce \ncompliance with the provisions of this law.\n  Under this bill, for a domestic Web site to sell prescription drugs \nlegally, the web site would have to display identifying information \nsuch as the names, addresses, and medical licensing information for \npharmacists and physicians associated with the Web site.\n  In addition, if a person wants to use the Internet to purchase their \nprescription drugs he or she will not be prohibited from doing so under \nthis bill but, in order to do so, must already have a prescription for \nthe drug that is valid in the United States prior to making the \nInternet purchase.\n  Reliance on the Internet for public health purposes and the expansion \nof telemedicine, particularly in rural areas, make it essential that \nthere be at the very least a minimum standard for what qualifies as an \nacceptable medical relationship between patients and their physicians.\n  According to the American Medical Association, a health care \npractitioner who offers a prescription for a patient he or she has \nnever seen before, based solely on an online questionnaire, generally \ndoes not meet the appropriate medical standard of care.\n  Let me illustrate the situation facing our country today. If a \nphysician's office prescribed and dispensed prescription drugs the same \nway Internet pharmacies currently can do, it would look something like \nthis: a physician opens a physical office, asks a patient to fill out a \nmedical history questionnaire in the lobby and give his or her credit \ncard information to the office manager. There is no nurse, and \ntherefore no one to take the patients' height, weight, blood pressure, \nverify his or her medical history, and so forth and no one to answer \nthe patient's questions regarding their health.\n  The questionnaire is then slipped through a hole in the window; the \noffice manager takes it to the physician, or person acting as the \nphysician, who then writes the prescription and hands it to the \npharmacist, or person acting as the pharmacist, in the next room. Once \nthe patient signs his credit card, he is on his way out the door, drugs \nin hand.\n  No examination is performed, no questions asked, and no verification \nor clarification of the answers provided on the medical history \nquestionnaire.\n  This illustration is not an exaggeration. It occurs everyday all \nacross the United States. The National Association of Boards of \nPharmacy estimates that there are around 500 identifiable rogue \npharmacy Web sites operating on the Internet.\n  According to the Federation of State Medical Boards, 31 States and \nthe District of Columbia either have laws or medical board initiatives \naddressing Internet medical practice.\n  Many States have already enacted laws defining acceptable practices \nfor qualifying medical relationships between doctors and patients and \nthis bill would not affect any existing State laws.\n  For example, California law was changed in 2000 to say: ``no person \nor entity may prescribe, dispense, or furnish, or cause to be \nprescribed, dispensed, or furnished dangerous drugs or dangerous \ndevices [defined as any drug or device unsafe for self-use] on the \nInternet for delivery to any person in this state, without a good faith \nprior examination and medical indication . . .''\n  I believe California's law is a perfect example of why this \nlegislation is needed. The law only applies to persons living in \nCalifornia. As we all know, however, the Internet is not bound by State \nor even country borders.\n  This legislation makes a critical step forward by providing \nadditional authority for State Attorneys General to file an injunction \nin Federal court to shut down an Internet site operating in another \nState that violates the provisions in the bill.\n  Under current law, in order to close down an Internet website selling \nprescription drugs prosecutors must take enforcement actions in every \nState where the Internet pharmacy operates, requiring a tremendous \namount of resources in an environment where the location of the website \nis difficult, if not impossible, to determine or keep track of.\n  This bill will allow a State Attorney General to bring a civil action \nin a Federal district court to enjoin a pharmacy operation and to \nenforce compliance with the provisions of the law in every jurisdiction \nwhere the pharmacy is operating.\n\n[[Page S1535]]\n\n  While this legislation pertains to domestic Internet pharmacies, the \npractice of international pharmacies selling low-cost drugs to U.S. \nconsumers who have valid prescriptions from their doctors deserves to \nbe discussed and debated on the Senate floor. It is my hope that the \nSenate will act this year on prescription drug importation legislation.\n  In closing, I want to share with you the story of Ryan T. Haight of \nLa Mesa, California in whose memory this bill is named.\n  Ryan was an 18-year old honor student from La Mesa, CA, when he died \nin his home on February 12, 2001.\n  His parents found a bottle of Vicodin in his room with a label from \nan out-of-State pharmacy.\n  It turns out that Ryan had been ordering addictive drugs online and \npaying with a debit card his parents gave him to buy baseball cards on \neBay.\n  Without a physical exam or his parents' consent, Ryan had been \nobtaining controlled substances, some from an Internet site in \nOklahoma. It only took a few months before Ryan's life was ended by an \noverdose on a cocktail of painkillers.\n  Ryan's story and others like it force us to ask why anyone in the \nU.S. would be able to access such highly addictive and dangerous drugs \nover the Internet with such ease?\n  Why was there no physician or pharmacist on the other end of this \nteenager's computer verifying his age, his medical history and that \nthere was a valid prescription?\n  That is why I support this legislation. It makes sensible \nrequirements of Internet pharmacy websites that will not impact access \nto convenient, oftentimes cost-saving drugs.\n  With simple disclosure requirements for Internet sites such as names, \naddresses and medical or pharmacy licensing information, patients will \nbe better off and State medica1 and pharmacy boards can ensure that \npharmacists and doctors are properly licensed.\n  Lastly, this bill will give State attorneys general the authority \nthey need to shut down rogue Internet pharmacies operating in other \nstates.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, \n        Mr. Biden, Mr. Dayton, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Corzine, \n        Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 401. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide individuals with disabilities and older Americans with equal \naccess to community-based attendant services and supports, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today, Senator Specter and I and others \nintroduce the Medicaid Community-Based Attendant Services and Supports \nAct of 2003 (MiCASSA). This legislation is needed to truly bring people \nwith disabilities into the mainstream of society and provide equal \nopportunity for employment and community activities.\n  We anticipate that there will be some discussions of so called \n``reform'' of the Medicaid system in this Congress. The Medicaid \nprogram is a critical source of services and supports for millions of \nAmericans with disabilities. Any attempt to cap resources or decrease \nthe availability of services under that program will meet strong \nopposition from myself and others.\n  But there is one area where Medicaid should be improved. Services \nshould be expanded to increase access to personal attendant services. \nIn order to work or live in their own homes, Americans with \nDisabilities and older Americans need access to community-based \nservices and supports. Unfortunately, under current Federal Medicaid \npolicy, the deck is stacked in favor of living in an institutional \nsetting. Federal law requires that states cover nursing homes in their \nMedicaid programs. But there is no similar requirement for attendant \nservices. The purpose of our bill is to level the playing field and \ngive eligible individuals equal access to community-based services and \nsupports they need.\n  The Medicaid Community Attendant Services and Supports Act will \naccomplish four goals.\n  First, the bill amends Title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide a new Medicaid plan benefit that would give individuals who are \ncurrently eligible for nursing home services or an intermediate care \nfacility for the mentally retarded equal access to community-based \nattendant services and supports.\n  Second, for a limited time, States would have the opportunity to \nreceive additional funds to support community attendant services and \nsupports and for certain administrative activities. Each State \ncurrently gets federal money for their Medicaid program based on a set \npercentage. This percentage is the Medicaid match rate. This bill would \nincrease that percentage to provide some additional funding to States \nto help them reform their long term care systems.\n  Third, the bill provides States with financial assistance to support \n``real choice systems change initiatives'' that include specific action \nsteps to increase the provision of home and community based services.\n  Finally, the bill establishes a demonstration project to evaluate \nservice coordination and cost sharing approaches with respect to the \nprovision of services and supports for individuals with disabilities \nunder the age of 65 who are dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare.\n  Although some states have already recognized the benefits of home and \ncommunity based services, they are unevenly distributed and only reach \na small percentage of eligible individuals. Every State offers services \nunder home and community based waiver programs, but they only serve a \ncapped number of individuals. Some states also are now providing the \npersonal care optional benefit through their Medicaid program, but \nothers do not.\n  Those left behind are often needlessly institutionalized because they \ncannot access community alternatives. A person with a disability's \ncivil right to be integrated into his or her community should not \ndepend on his or her address. In Olmstead v. LC, the Supreme Court \nrecognized that needless institutionalization is a form of \ndiscrimination under the Americans With Disabilities Act. We in \nCongress have a responsibility to help States meet their obligations \nunder Olmstead.\n  This MICASSA legislation is designed to do just that and make the \npromise of the ADA a reality. It will help rebalance the current \nMedicaid long term care system, which spends a disproportionate amount \non institutional services. For example, in 2003, 67 percent of long \nterm care Medicaid dollars were spent on institutional care, compared \nto 33 percent community based care.\n  And that means that individuals do not have equal access to community \nbased care throughout this country. An individual should not be asked \nto move to another state in order to avoid needless segregation. They \nalso should not be moved away from family and friends because their \nonly choice is an institution.\n  Federal Medicaid policy should reflect the consensus reached in the \nADA that Americans with Disabilities should have equal opportunity to \ncontribute to our communities and participate in our society as full \ncitizens. That means no one has to sacrifice their full participation \nin society because they need help getting out of the house in the \nmorning or assistance with personal care or some other basic service.\n  I applaud the President's New Freedom Initiative for People with \nDisabilities and believe that this legislation helps promote the goals \nof that initiative. I will be reintroducing the Money Follows the \nPerson legislation that is part of the New Freedom Initiative and \nbelieve that MICASSA and Money Follows the Person complement each \nother. Together these two bills could substantially reform long term \nservices in this country.\n  Community based attendant services and supports allow people with \ndisabilities to lead independent lives, have jobs, and participate in \nthe community. Some will become taxpayers, some will get an education, \nand some will participate in recreational and civic activities. But all \nwill experience a chance to make their own choices and govern their own \nlives.\n  This bill will open the door to full participation by people with \ndisabilities in our workplaces, our economy, and our American Dream, \nand I urge\n\n[[Page S1536]]\n\nall my colleagues to support us on this issue. I want to thank Senator \nSpecter for his leadership on this issue and his commitment to \nimproving access to home and community based services for people with \ndisabilities. I would also like to thank Senators Kennedy, Kerry, \nBiden, Dayton, Landrieu, Corzine, Schumer, Lautenberg, Lieberman and \nDodd for joining me in this important initiative.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 401\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Long-term services and supports provided under the \n     medicaid program established under title XIX of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) must meet the ability \n     and life choices of individuals with disabilities and older \n     Americans, including the choice to live in one's own home or \n     with one's own family and to become a productive member of \n     the community.\n       (2) Research on the provision of long-term services and \n     supports under the medicaid program (conducted by and on \n     behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services) has \n     revealed a significant funding bias toward institutional \n     care. Only about 33 percent of long term care funds expended \n     under the medicaid program, and only about 11 percent of all \n     funds expended under that program, pay for services and \n     supports in home and community-based settings.\n       (3) In the case of medicaid beneficiaries who need long \n     term care, the only long-term care service currently \n     guaranteed by Federal law in every State is nursing home \n     care. Only 30 States have adopted the benefit option of \n     providing personal care services under the medicaid program. \n     Although every State has chosen to provide certain services \n     under home and community-based waivers, these services are \n     unevenly available within and across States, and reach a \n     small percentage of eligible individuals. In fiscal year \n     2003, only 7 States spent 50 percent or more of their \n     medicaid long term care funds under the medicaid program on \n     home and community-based care.\n       (4) The goals of the Nation properly include providing \n     families of children with disabilities, working-age adults \n     with disabilities, and older Americans with--\n       (A) a meaningful choice of receiving long-term services and \n     supports in the most integrated setting appropriate to their \n     needs;\n       (B) the greatest possible control over the services \n     received and, therefore, their own lives and futures; and\n       (C) quality services that maximize independence in the home \n     and community, including in the workplace.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:\n       (1) To reform the medicaid program established under title \n     XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) to \n     provide equal access to community-based attendant services \n     and supports.\n       (2) To provide financial assistance to States as they \n     reform their long-term care systems to provide comprehensive \n     statewide long-term services and supports, including \n     community-based attendant services and supports that provide \n     consumer choice and direction, in the most integrated setting \n     appropriate.\n\n            TITLE I--ESTABLISHMENT OF MEDICAID PLAN BENEFIT\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to join Senator \nTom Harkin, my colleague and distinguished ranking member of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and \nEducation, which I chair, in introducing the ``Medicaid Attendant Care \nServices and Supports Act of 2005.'' This creative proposal addresses a \nglaring gap in Federal health coverage, and assists one of our Nation's \nmost vulnerable populations, persons with disabilities.\n  In an effort to improve the delivery of care and the comfort of those \nwith long-term disabilities, this vital legislation would allow for \nreimbursement for community-based attendant care services, in lieu of \ninstitutionalization, for eligible individuals who require such \nservices based on functional need, without regard to the individual's \nage or the nature of the disability. Under this proposal, Medicaid \nwould provide States funding to offer and allow individuals who are \ncurrently eligible for nursing home services or an intermediate care \nfacility for the mentally retarded equal access to community-based \nattendants.\n  The most recent data available tell us that 8.9 million individuals \nreceive care for disabilities under the Medicaid program. The number of \ndisabled who are currently enrolled in Medicaid and would apply for \nthis improved benefit has been estimated at 2 million, a substantial \nnumber due largely to the preference of home and community-based care \nover institutional care. Currently, each State gets Federal money for \ntheir Medicaid program based on a Medicaid match rate. This bill would \ntemporarily increase the Medicaid matching percentage providing States \nwith additional funding to reform their long term care systems and \nimplement this benefit.\n  Let me speak briefly about why such a change in Medicaid law is so \ndesperately needed. The Supreme Court held in Olmstead v. L.C., 119 S. \nCt. 2176 (1999), that the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, \nrequires States, under some circumstances, to provide community-based \ntreatment to persons with mental disabilities rather than placing them \nin institutions. This decision and several lower court decisions have \npointed to the need for a structured Medicaid attendant-care services \nbenefit in order to meet obligations under the ADA. Disability \nadvocates strongly support this legislation, arguing that the lack of \nMedicaid community-based services options is discriminatory and \nunhealthful for disabled individuals. Virtually every major disability \nadvocacy group supports this bill, including ADAPT, the Arc, the \nNational Council on Independent Living, Paralyzed Veterans of America,\n\n[[Page S1540]]\n\nand the National Spinal Cord Injury Association.\n  Senator Harkin and I recognize that such a shift in the Medicaid \nprogram is a huge undertaking--but feel that it is a vitally important \none. We are introducing this legislation today in an attempt to move \nahead with the consideration of crucial disability legislation and to \nprovide a starting point for debate. The time has come for concerted \naction in this arena.\n  I urge the Congressional leadership, including the appropriate \ncommittee chairmen, to move forward in considering this legislation, \nand take the significant next step forward in achieving the objective \nof providing individuals with disabilities the freedom to live in their \nown communities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 404.

A bill to provide for the conveyance of certain public land \nin Clark County, Nevada, for use as a heliport; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today, for myself and Senator Ensign, \nto introduce legislation to establish a public heliport facility in \nClark County, NY.\n  The purpose of this bill is simple: It would convey about a third of \na square mile of public land managed by the Bureau of Land Management \nto Clark County for dedicated use as a heliport. The land is located \njust south of the Henderson city limits and east of Interstate 15.\n  The establishment of this heliport will help eliminate the ongoing \nconflict between air tour operators whose overflights of the Grand \nCanyon represent a classic component of the Las Vegas visitor \nexperience and residents in the west-central and southwestern parts of \nthe Las Vegas Valley whose every day lives are adversely affected by \nhelicopter noise.\n  Local officials are committed to establishing a heliport within the \nLas Vegas Valley. The county and local municipalities have previously \nconsidered a site, currently in use as a go-kart track, near Interstate \n15 near Henderson. The drawback of developing this site is that tours \noriginating from this location would fly over the most sensitive parts \nof the Sloan Canyon National Conservation Area, with no restrictions on \nrouting or elevation. Sloan Canyon itself--one of the richest \npetroglyph sites in the Mohave Desert--would be subject to regular \noverflights. That outcome would be entirely legal, entirely predictable \nand entirely regrettable.\n  In 2002, I worked closely with Senator Ensign, Congresswoman Berkley, \nCongressman Gibbons and local advocates to protect the Sloan Canyon \narea and its unique cultural resources. Through our combined efforts we \ncreated the Sloan Canyon National Conservation Area and the McCullough \nMountains Wilderness, I am proud of these efforts and today I offer \nthis legislation as a further effort to protect the precious resources \nthat we worked to safeguard in 2002.\n  The bill I am introducing in the Senate today, and which I offered in \nthe 108th Congress, would not prohibit helicopter overflights of the \nSloan Canyon National Conservation Area. But it does ensure that such \nflights steer clear of the most sensitive and special cultural \nresources and minimize the impact on the majestic bighorn sheep and \nother wildlife that live in the McCullough Mountains.\n  My legislation stipulates that any helicopter flight originating from \nand/or landing at this heliport would be required by law to fly within \na set path--between 3 and 5 miles north of the southernmost boundary of \nthe Sloan Canyon National Conservation Area--and at a minimum height--\nat least 500 to 1000 feet above ground level while in the NCA. Further, \nit requires that every such flight contribute 3 dollars per passenger \nto a special fund dedicated to the protection of the cultural, \nwilderness, and wildlife resources in Nevada.\n  These provisions justify conveying the land to Clark County at no \ncost because they provide a stable, long-term source of funding in \nexcess of the market value of the land and because the conveyance and \nuse are in the public interest.\n  It was my pleasure to introduce this bill during the last Congress. \nMy fellow Senators, particularly the Chairman and Ranking member of the \nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, were generous in their \nsupport of this measure, allowing us to hold a prompt hearing. I am \nhopeful that my distinguished colleagues will work with me to complete \nwork on this important legislation during the current session.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 405\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title I of the Employee Retirement Security \nAct of 1974 to improve access and choice for entrepreneurs with small \nbusinesses with respect to medical care for their employees; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as Chair of the Committee on Small Business \nand Entrepreneurship, I rise to introduce the Small Business Health \nFairness Act of 2005. I am joined in this bipartisan effort by Senators \nTalent, Bond, Byrd, Dole, McCain, Hutchison, Coleman, Vitter and \nMartinez.\n  This bill creates Association Health Plans (AHPs), also called Small \nBusiness Health Plans, that give small businesses the same market based \nadvantages and leverage that large employers and unions currently enjoy \nwhen providing health insurance to their employees.\n  AHPs directly address one of the most critical issues facing small \nbusinesses nationwide: the crisis small businesses face trying to \nprovide health insurance for their employees. No other issue has been \nmentioned so frequently or by so many of the small businesses with whom \nI have met since I became Chair. While the problem has been growing for \nyears, the outcry has built so that now it is indeed a loud chorus of \nsmall businesses desperate for relief and demanding that something be \ndone.\n  Without exception, every small business person who has approached me \nhas asked me to do something about the crushing burden from increased \nhealth insurance costs. The anecdotal accounts that I have heard have \nbeen confirmed by reports detailing how much health insurance costs are \nincreasing across the board for all employers and especially for small \nbusinesses.\n  The Kaiser Family Foundation has reported that health insurance \npremiums increased between the spring of 2003 and spring of 2004 by \n11.2 percent. This is the fourth such year of double digit increases \nand follows increases of 13.9 percent, 12.9 percent and 10.9 percent. \nIn contrast, overall inflation during the last three years was 2.3 \npercent, 2.2 percent and 1.6 percent, wage gains for non-supervisory \nworkers were similarly stable at 2.2 percent, 3.1 percent and 3.2 \npercent, respectively. This is an astonishing trend.\n  Not only are the costs for employers increasing, but these are now \nbeing passed onto the employees. As a result, the amount of premium \nemployees pay for family coverage has increased almost 64 percent over \nthe past 4 years, from $1,619 to $2,661. As I have heard from many \nsmall businesses, increases in insurance costs often mean employees do \nnot get the benefit of salary and wage increases. Employers are \nrewarding employees with raises and then requiring them to pay more of \ntheir health insurance. These employers are disheartened that they are \ngiving a raise with one hand and then turning around and taking it away \nwith the other.\n  The Kaiser report also shows that this year, firms with 3 to 199 \nworkers had premium increases of 9.1 percent and the smallest firms \nwith 3 to 9 workers averaged 12.4 percent increases. So we see that as \nbad as things have gotten they're worse for the smallest businesses who \nare the source of as much as 75 percent of our country's new jobs. In \nmy meetings with small businesses, they invariably report increases far \ngreater than even these percentages, generally 30 percent, 40 percent \nor more.\n  The increase in these costs can not be dismissed as just another cost \nof doing business and absorbed or passed on to customers, because we \nknow small businesses often have lower profit margins for their goods \nand services than other businesses. These skyrocketing costs often mean \nthe difference between the business expanding or struggling to survive.\n  The high cost of health insurance can even make the difference in \nwhether a small business creates new jobs. Small businesses have told \nme that the high cost of providing health care is preventing small \nbusinesses from adding more employees because they can not afford the \nadditional health insurance expenses. In other cases, employers are \nturning to temporary or part time employees, again to avoid paying \noutrageous health insurance costs.\n  The result of these higher costs is that, according to the U.S. \nCensus Bureau, in 2003 there were 45 million people without insurance, \n1.4 million more than the year before and 3.8 million since 2001. This \nis being attributed to a decrease in the number of people covered by \ninsurance through their employers--down 61 percent in 2004. \nDisturbingly, the Kaiser study says that only 52 percent of firms with \n3 to 9 employees offer health benefits. Indeed, sometimes I wonder how \nsmall businesses can provide insurance at all. The fact that so many do \nis testimony to their recognition of how essential this is to their \nemployees, and their determination to offer this benefit even in the \nface of constantly skyrocketing costs.\n  Last year's Kaiser report suggests that the greater increase in \npremiums for traditionally insured plans of 15.6 percent versus self \ninsured plans at 12.4 percent ``may indicate that part of the rise in \nhealth care premiums is due to insurers expanding their underwriting \ngains.'' They also say that one of the factors driving the high rate of \npremium growth appears to be ``insurers' efforts to emphasize \nprofitability in their pricing.''\n  What these statements really mean is that insurance companies are \ngetting as much as they can out of their small business customers \nbecause they know these customers have no other options. Large \nemployers, unlike small businesses, have competition for their business \nbecause they have many employees through whom to spread the risks. This \nmakes them attractive to insurance companies who compete for their \nbusiness.\n  Large employers also have the option of self insuring under ERISA \nwhich is only practical for employers who are large enough to afford \nthe costs. This approach, though, offers significant savings by \neliminating the administrative costs of the middle man--the insurance \ncompanies. A study by SBA's Office of Advocacy has shown that these \nplans have administrative costs as much as 30 percent lower.\n  Small businesses from my home state of Maine have made it clear that \nthey have only one choice for their health care. Even when they band \ntogether in local purchasing pools, they are unable to attract any \nother insurance carriers to provide them with less expensive and more \nflexible options. Right after small businesses tell me how high their \nrates are they tell me how they have no choices and in some cases are \neven lucky to have anyone offering them any coverage at all.\n  In response to this health care crisis facing the small business \ncommunity, I am introducing the Small Business Health Fairness Act of \n2005.\n  This bill creates national Association Health Plans which allow small \nbusinesses to pool their employees together under the auspices of their \nbona fide associations to get the same bulk purchasing and \nadministrative efficiencies already enjoyed by large employers and \nunions with their health care plans. It builds on the success of the \nERISA self\n\n[[Page S1542]]\n\ninsurance plans used by large employers and the Taft-Hartley plans \navailable to union employers. These two types of plans currently \nprovide health benefits for 72 million people, more than half of the \n130 million total people who get their health insurance through their \nemployer.\n  It is ludicrous that we have a two tiered health insurance system in \nthis country where one group of employers--large ones and those who are \nunion employers--get preferential treatment over those who create over \n75 percent of the new jobs. I am at a loss to understand why small \nbusinesses should be denied the same advantages that these other \nemployers already have. This is a matter of basic fairness.\n  AHPs will be able to offer less expensive plans, and also greater \nflexibility because they will be exempt from the myriad state benefit \nregulations. Associations will be able to design their plans to meet \nthe needs of their members and their employees. By administering one \nnational plan, it will further reduce the administrative costs instead \nof trying to administer a plan subject to the mandates of each state.\n  Even though the benefit mandates will not be in effect, associations \nwill need to design their plans so that enough members participate in \nthem to attract the necessary employees to make them work. This means \nthat they will naturally provide a full range of benefits similar to \nwhat many states currently require. In many cases, the plans offered by \nlarge employers and unions, which are also exempt from the state \nbenefit mandates, are the most generous plans available. People will \noften stay in those jobs specifically to keep their health care \ncoverage.\n  The bill would also provide extensive new protections to ensure that \nthe health care coverage is there when employees need it. Associations \nsponsoring these plans would need to be established for at least three \nyears for purposes other than providing health insurance--this is \nintended to prevent the current epidemic of fraud and abuse that is \noccurring through sham associations who take money from unsuspecting \nsmall businesses and then cease to exist when someone files a claim.\n  In addition, self-funded AHPs would be required to have sufficient \nfunds in reserve, specific stop-loss insurances, indemnification \ninsurance, and other funding and certification requirements to make \nsure the insurance coverage would be available when needed. None of \nthese requirements apply to any of the plans currently regulated by the \nDepartment of Labor, either the large employer plans under the Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act (ERISA), or the union plans under the \nTaft-Hartley Act.\n\n  Yet, the opponents of this bill have mis-characterized it in ways \nthat make it sound like this would be the worst thing in the world for \nsmall businesses.\n  They have said that this bill would lead to ``cherry picking''--where \nAHPs would only take young healthy people. There is language in the \nbill which explicitly states that an association which offers a plan \nmust offer it to all of their members, and a member who participates in \nthe plan must offer the plan to every employee. Violation of these \nrequirements is subject to enforcement by the Department of Labor under \nERISA.\n  They have said that the Department of Labor would not be able to \nhandle their responsibilities under this bill. The Department of Labor \nis already overseeing 275,000 similarly structured plans. We do not \nhear employees complain about these plans, or that they are failing and \nleaving subscribers without coverage. The additional plans from AHPs \nwould not add that much of a burden to their operations and the \nSecretary of Labor has testified before the Small Business Committee \nthat sufficient resources would be available to make sure the \nDepartment fulfilled its obligations.\n  Opponents have claimed that AHPs would not be subject to any solvency \nprotections or other insurance regulations. This is flat out not true. \nThe bill specifies detailed solvency protections that self funded AHPs \nwould have to implement which are far beyond anything current self \nfunded large employer plans have to implement. In fact those plans are \nnot required to have any solvency protections. Insurance companies that \nwould provide the coverage for fully insured AHPs would continue to be \nsubject to state solvency requirements, as well as other state \nprotections in the same way as they are now.\n  Opponents of this bill are basically saying that small businesses do \nnot need more options and that they should be satisfied with the few \nthat they have. They want to preserve the status quo which does nothing \nfor small businesses. This bill would create competition in the small \ngroup market where there currently is none. If we expect our small \nemployers to provide health insurance to their employees, we must pass \nAHP legislation to give them the same advantages enjoyed by large \nemployers and union employers.\n  Giving small businesses better and more affordable options for their \nhealth care will also have an impact on the larger problem of the \nuninsured. The latest Census Bureau figures indicate that in 2003 \napproximately 45 million people had no health insurance. We also know \nthat about 60 percent of these uninsured work for a small business, or \nare in a family of someone who works for a small business. The CBO has \nestimated that 600,000 people would go from being uninsured to being \ninsured if AHPs were available. There are other studies that show this \nnumber could be more like 4.5 million and possibly as high as 8.5 \nmillion. What is clear is that giving small businesses AHPs as an \noption will mean that more of them who currently do not offer health \ninsurance will be able to provide this benefit to their employees and \ntheir families.\n  This bill is supported by a large coalition of small business \ninterests with approximately 12 million employers who represent about \n80 million employees. President Bush included AHPs in the State of the \nUnion and has made this part of his agenda for providing more health \ncare options and helping small businesses. During the campaign he \ncalled for passage of this bill on almost a daily basis. And he \ncontinues to call for its passage. Our Majority Leader has indicated \nhis support for taking up this bill. The House has passed the bill \nseveral times with strong bipartisan support and will pass it again \nthis year. Significantly, the Senate Task Force on the Uninsured \nincluded AHPs among its recommendation for increasing coverage. The \ntime has come to get this bill through the Senate. We must pass AHPs \nthis session.\n  In the time I have been Chair of the Small Business Committee, I have \ncome to understand even more that the entrepreneurial spirit burns \nbright throughout our nation. There are millions of people who seek a \nbetter life and personal satisfaction through starting and running \nsmall businesses. These folks are not looking for a handout, or \npreferential treatment. They are merely looking to us to recognize the \nabsolutely essential role they play in our economy and to be treated \naccordingly and fairly. If we want more jobs, and better family lives, \nwe must give small businesses the support they are seeking.\n  While this bill has passed the House with bipartisan support on \nseveral occasions, it has not been considered in the Senate. I intend \nto change that. I will work with Senator Enzi as the new chair of the \nHELP Committee, Senate Leaders, and others to find ways and develop \nenhancements to get this bill through the Senate. If there are changes \nthat can be made, I am willing to consider them.\n  I believe we will see movement on this issue this Congress, and I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues to bring relief and \nassistance to our nation's small businesses.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 406\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, with approximately 45 million uninsured \nAmericans, expanding access to quality, affordable health care should \nbe a top priority for the Senate. We hear about the cost explosion that \ninsurance companies are imposing on small businesses and how small \nbusiness owners are now finding it virtually impossible to provide the \nhealth insurance coverage that they, as well as their employees, need. \nNo one is harder hit by large premium increases than small business--\nstudies indicate more than 60 percent of these uninsured Americans \neither work for a small business or are dependent upon someone who \ndoes. As health care costs skyrocket and place more and more small \nbusiness employees in jeopardy of losing their health benefits, it \nbecomes more important that Congress turn its attention to the \nuninsured and act in a swift and bipartisan manner to address this \nproblem.\n  Today we are here to offer hope to the millions of uninsured. Today \nwe are here to talk about a solution that can help millions of small \nbusiness employees access the same type of health care that their \ncounterparts in large corporations and unions already enjoy.\n  The solution to this problem is to allow small businesses across the \ncountry to pool together and access health insurance through their \nmembership with a bona fide trade or professional organization. This \nwill provide small businesses the same opportunities as other large \ninsurance purchasers. These Association Health Plans, AHPs, would \nreduce costs through greater economies of scale to spread costs and \nrisk, increase group bargaining power with large insurance companies, \nand generate more insurance options for small businesses.\n  AHPs are not a new idea. They have been talked about, bandied about, \nargued about and compromised about for almost a decade. And during that \nperiod, what was once thought to be a manageable problem--became the \ncrisis that we have today. Had we passed AHP legislation, we would not \nbe seeing the problems we see today for small business.\n  The principle underpinning AHPs is simple. This is the same principle \nthat makes it cheaper to buy your soda by the case instead of by \nindividual cans. Bulk purchasing is why large companies and unions can \nget better rates for their employees than small businesses and it is \nabout time that we bring Fortune 500 style health benefits to the \nNation's Main Street small businesses and their employees.\n  In the words of President Bush, ``It makes no sense in America, to \nisolate small businesses as little health care islands unto \nthemselves.'' AHPs will mean more coverage for the employees of these \ncompanies, especially their families and children.\n  It is time that we take control and find a way to curtail the \nexplosive costs of health care. Small businesses deserve a chance to \nchannel these funds toward other needs, such as expanding and creating \nmore jobs for the\n\n[[Page S1550]]\n\neconomy. Association Health Plans will level the playing field and \nbreak down the barriers that prevent small businesses from providing \nhealth insurance.\n  I commend Senator Snowe for taking the lead on this critical issue \nand for using her position as chairwomen of the Small Business \nCommittee to advance the number one health care priority of the small \nbusiness community. With the support of President Bush, the Department \nof Labor, the Small Business Administration, and a broad and diverse \ncoalition of over 100 groups, I hope that this bill will more quickly.\n  For the sake of small businesses throughout this country, their \nemployees, and their families we must pass AHP legislation. We must \nbring fortune 500 health care to small business. The time to act is \nnow. I thank Senators Snowe and Talent for their leadership, dedication \nand commitment on behalf of small business, and I look forward to \nworking with them to pass Association Health Plans legislation in the \nSenate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Warner, Mr. \n        Corzine, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Lautenberg, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \n        Jeffords, and Mr. Salazar):\n  S. 408. A bill to provide for programs and activities with respect to \nthe prevention of underage drinking; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my good friend \nand colleague Senator Dodd, to reintroduce the Sober Truth on \nPreventing Underage Drinking Act--also known as the STOP Underage \nDrinking Act. I thank Senator Dodd for his commitment to this issue, as \nwell as our colleagues on the House side--Representatives Roybal-\nAllard, Wolf, Osborne, DeLauro, and Wamp for working so diligently with \nus to draft this bill. It is a good bill--a carefully crafted, bi-\npartisan, bi-cameral piece of legislation.\n  I also want to thank the additional Senate co-sponsors of this \nlegislation--Senators Hagel, Warner, Lieberman, Lautenberg, Landrieu, \nCorzine, Jeffords, and Salazar. I thank them for their support. They \nknow that underage drinking is a serious, and often deadly, problem for \nour Nation's children and youth and that we have to do something about \nit.\n  In September 2003, I chaired a HELP Subcommittee hearing about \nunderage drinking. As we discussed at that hearing, it is well known \nthat underage drinking is a significant problem for youth in this \ncountry. We've known that for a very long time.\n  We know that underage drinking often contributes to the four leading \ncauses of deaths among 15 to 20 year olds--that 69 percent of youths \nwho died in alcohol-related traffic fatalities in the year 2000 \ninvolved young drinking drivers and that in 1999, nearly 40 percent of \npeople under the age of 21 who were victims of drownings, burns, and \nfalls tested positive for alcohol. We also know that alcohol has been \nreported to be involved in 36 percent of homicides, 12 percent of male \nsuicides, and 8 percent of female suicides involving people under 21.\n  How did we get here. These statistics are frightening. Too many \nAmerican kids are drinking regularly, and they are drinking in \nquantities that can be of great, long-term harm. As a nation, we \nclearly haven't done enough to address this problem. We haven't done \nenough to acknowledge how prevalent and widespread teenage drinking is \nin this country. We haven't done enough to let parents know that they, \ntoo, are a part of this problem and can be a part of the solution.\n  We talk about drugs and the dangers of drug use, as we should, but \nthe reality is that we, as a society, have become complacent about the \nproblem of underage drinking. This has to change. The culture has to \nchange.\n  One way to begin changing this culture is with the STOP Underage \nDrinking Act. Our legislation has four major areas of policy \ndevelopment:\n  First, there is a federal coordination and reporting provision. This \ntitle would create an Interagency Coordinating Committee to coordinate \nthe efforts and expertise of various federal agencies to combat \nunderage drinking. It would be chaired by the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services and would include other agencies and departments, such \nas the Department of Education, the Office of Juvenile Justice and \nDelinquency Prevention, and the Federal Trade Commission. This title \nalso would mandate an annual report to Congress from the Interagency \nCommittee on their efforts to combat underage drinking, as well as an \nannual report card on State efforts to combat the problem. Two million \ndollars annually would be appropriated under this section.\n  Second, the bill contains an authorization for an adult-oriented \nnational media campaign against underage drinking. This title would \nprovide $1 million in fiscal years 2006 and 2007 to authorize a \nnational media campaign for which the Ad Council has received start up \nfunding. The campaign is expected to launch in August of this year.\n  Third, the bill would support new intervention programs to prevent \nunderage drinking. This section of the bill would provide $5 million \nfor enhancement grants to the Drug Free Communities program to be \ndirected at the problem of underage drinking. This title also would \ncreate a program which would provide competitive grants to states, non-\nprofit entities, and institutions of higher education to create state-\nwide coalitions to prevent underage drinking. These grants will work to \nchange the culture of underage drinking at our Nation's institutions of \nhigher education and their surrounding communities. This program would \nbe funded at $5 million annually, as well.\n  Finally, our bill contains a section devoted to research. This title \nwould provide $6 million for increased federal research and data \ncollection on underage drinking, including reporting on the types and \nbrands of alcohol that kids use and the short-term and long-term \nimpacts of underage drinking upon adolescent brain development.\n  Again, I thank Senator Dodd for working with me on this issue here in \nthe Senate, and I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues \nin the House and Senate to pass this very important bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 408\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Sober \n     Truth on Preventing Underage Drinking Act'', or the ``STOP \n     Underage Drinking Act''.\n       (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act \n     is as follows:\n\nSec. 1.

Authorization of appropriations.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Drinking alcohol under the age of 21 is illegal in each \n     of the 50 States and the District of Columbia. Enforcement of \n     current laws and regulations in States and communities, such \n     as minimum age drinking laws, zero tolerance laws, and laws \n     and regulations which restrict availability of alcohol, must \n     supplement other efforts to reduce underage drinking.\n       (2) Data collected annually by the Department of Health and \n     Human Services shows that alcohol is the most heavily used \n     drug by children in the United States, and that--\n       (A) more youths consume alcoholic beverages than use \n     tobacco products or illegal drugs;\n       (B) by the end of the eighth grade, 45.6 percent of \n     children have engaged in alcohol use,\n\n[[Page S1551]]\n\n     and by the end of high school, 76.6 percent have done so; and\n       (C) the annual societal cost of underage drinking is \n     estimated at $53 to $58 billion.\n       (3) Data collected by the Department of Health and Human \n     Services and the Department of Transportation indicate that \n     alcohol use by youth has many negative consequences, such as \n     immediate risk from acute impairment; traffic fatalities; \n     violence; suicide; and unprotected sex.\n       (4) Research confirms that the harm caused by underage \n     drinking lasts beyond the underage years. Compared to persons \n     who wait until age 21 or older to start drinking, those who \n     start to drink before age 14 are, as adults, four times more \n     likely to become alcohol dependent; seven times more likely \n     to be in a motor vehicle crash because of drinking; and more \n     likely to suffer mental and physical damage from alcohol \n     abuse.\n       (5) Alcohol abuse creates long-term risk developmentally \n     and is associated with negative physical impacts on the \n     brain.\n       (6) Research indicates that adults greatly underestimate \n     the extent of alcohol use by youths, its negative \n     consequences, and its use by their own children. The IOM \n     report concluded that underage drinking cannot be \n     successfully addressed by focusing on youth alone. \n     Ultimately, adults are responsible for young people obtaining \n     alcohol by selling, providing, or otherwise making it \n     available to them. Parents are the most important channel of \n     influence on their children's underage drinking, according to \n     the IOM report, which also recommends a national adult-\n     oriented media campaign.\n       (7) Research shows that public service health messages, in \n     combination with community-based efforts, can reduce health-\n     damaging behavior. The Department of Health and Human \n     Services and the Ad Council have undertaken a public health \n     campaign targeted at parents to combat underage alcohol \n     consumption. The Ad Council estimates that, for a typical \n     public health campaign, it receives an average of $28 million \n     per year in free media through its 28,000 media outlets \n     nationwide.\n       (8) A significant percentage of the total alcohol \n     consumption in the United States each year is by underage \n     youth. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \n     Administration reports that the percentage is over 11 \n     percent.\n       (9) Youth are exposed to a significant amount of alcohol \n     advertising through a variety of media. Some studies indicate \n     that youth awareness of alcohol advertising correlates to \n     their drinking behavior and beliefs.\n       (10) According to the Center on Alcohol Marketing and \n     Youth, in 2002, the alcoholic beverage industry spent \n     $927,900,000 on product advertising on television, and \n     $24,700,000 on television advertising designed to promote the \n     responsible use of alcohol. For every one television ad \n     discouraging underage alcohol use, there were 215 product \n     ads.\n       (11) Alcohol use occurs in 76 percent of movies rated G or \n     PG and 97 percent of movies rated PG-13. The Federal Trade \n     Commission has recommended restricting paid alcohol beverage \n     promotional placements to films rated R or NC-17.\n       (12) Youth spend 9 to 11 hours per week listening to music, \n     and 17 percent of all lyrics contain alcohol references; 30 \n     percent of those songs include brand-name mentions.\n       (13) Studies show that adolescents watch 20 to 27 hours of \n     television each week, and 71 percent of prime-time television \n     episodes depict alcohol use and 77 percent contain some \n     reference to alcohol.\n       (14) College and university presidents have cited alcohol \n     abuse as the number one health problem on college and \n     university campuses.\n       (15) According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse \n     and Alcoholism, two of five college students are binge \n     drinkers; 1,400 college students die each year from alcohol-\n     related injuries, a majority of which involve motor vehicle \n     crashes; more than 70,000 students are victims of alcohol-\n     related sexual assault; and 500,000 students are injured \n     under the influence of alcohol each year.\n       (16) According to the Center on Alcohol Marketing and \n     Youth, in 2002, alcohol producers spent a total of $58 \n     million to place 6,251 commercials in college sports \n     programs, and spent $27.7 million advertising during the NCAA \n     men's basketball tournament, which had as many alcohol ads \n     (939) as the Super Bowl, World Series, College Bowl Games and \n     the National Football League's Monday Night Football \n     broadcasts combined (925).\n       (17) The IOM report recommended that colleges and \n     universities ban alcohol advertising and promotion on campus \n     in order to demonstrate their commitment to discouraging \n     alcohol use among underage students.\n       (18) According to the Government Accountability Office \n     (``GAO''), the Federal Government spends $1.8 billion \n     annually to combat youth drug use and $71 million to prevent \n     underage alcohol use.\n       (19) The GAO concluded that there is a lack of reporting \n     about how these funds are specifically expended, inadequate \n     collaboration among the agencies, and no central coordinating \n     group or office to oversee how the funds are expended or to \n     determine the effectiveness of these efforts.\n       (20) There are at least three major, annual, government \n     funded national surveys in the United States that include \n     underage drinking data: the National Household Survey on Drug \n     Use and Health, Monitoring the Future, and the Youth Risk \n     Behavior Survey. These surveys do not use common indicators \n     to allow for direct comparison of youth alcohol consumption \n     patterns. Analyses of recent years' data do, however, show \n     similar results.\n       (21) Research shows that school-based and community-based \n     interventions can reduce underage drinking and associated \n     problems, and that positive outcomes can be achieved by \n     combining environmental and institutional change with theory-\n     based health education--a comprehensive, community-based \n     approach.\n       (22) Studies show that a minority of youth who need \n     treatment for their alcohol problems receive such services. \n     Further, insufficient information exists to properly assist \n     clinicians and other providers in their youth treatment \n     efforts.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For purposes of this Act:\n       (1) The term ``binge drinking'' means a pattern of drinking \n     alcohol that brings blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08 \n     gm percent or above. For the typical adult, this pattern \n     corresponds to consuming 5 or more drinks (male), or 4 or \n     more drinks (female), in about 2 hours.\n       (2) The term ``heavy drinking'' means five or more drinks \n     on the same occasion in the past 30 days.\n       (3) The term ``frequent heavy drinking'' means five or more \n     drinks on at least five occasions in the last 30 days.\n       (4) The term ``alcoholic beverage industry'' means the \n     brewers, vintners, distillers, importers, distributors, and \n     retail outlets that sell and serve beer, wine, and distilled \n     spirits.\n       (5) The term ``school-based prevention'' means programs, \n     which are institutionalized, and run by staff members or \n     school-designated persons or organizations in every grade of \n     school, kindergarten through 12th grade.\n       (6) The term ``youth'' means persons under the age of 21.\n       (7) The term ``IOM report'' means the report released in \n     September 2003 by the National Research Council, Institute of \n     Medicine, and entitled ``Reducing Underage Drinking: A \n     Collective Responsibility''.\n\n                       TITLE I--SENSE OF CONGRESS\n\n     SEC. 101. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that:\n       (1) A multi-faceted effort is needed to more successfully \n     address the problem of underage drinking in the United \n     States. A coordinated approach to prevention, intervention, \n     treatment, and research is key to making progress. This Act \n     recognizes the need for a focused national effort, and \n     addresses particulars of the Federal portion of that effort.\n       (2) States and communities, including colleges and \n     universities, are encouraged to adopt comprehensive \n     prevention approaches, including--\n       (A) evidence-based screening, programs and curricula;\n       (B) brief intervention strategies;\n       (C) consistent policy enforcement; and\n       (D) environmental changes that limit underage access to \n     alcohol.\n       (3) Public health and consumer groups have played an \n     important role in drawing the Nation's attention to the \n     health crisis of underage drinking. Working at the Federal, \n     State, and community levels, and motivated by grass-roots \n     support, they have initiated effective prevention programs \n     that have made significant progress in the battle against \n     underage drinking.\n       (4) The alcohol beverage industry has developed and paid \n     for national education and awareness messages on illegal \n     underage drinking directed to parents as well as consumers \n     generally. According to the industry, it has also supported \n     the training of more than 1.6 million retail employees, \n     community-based prevention programs, point of sale education, \n     and enforcement programs. All of these efforts are aimed at \n     further reducing illegal underage drinking and preventing \n     sales of alcohol to persons under the age of 21. All sectors \n     of the alcohol beverage industry have also voluntarily \n     committed to placing advertisements in broadcast and \n     magazines where at least 70 percent of the audiences are \n     expected to be 21 years of age or older. The industry should \n     continue to monitor and tailor its advertising practices to \n     further limit underage exposure, including the use of \n     independent third party review. The industry should continue \n     and expand evidence-based efforts to prevent underage \n     drinking.\n       (5) Public health and consumer groups, in collaboration \n     with the alcohol beverage industry, should explore \n     opportunities to reduce underage drinking.\n       (6) The entertainment industries have a powerful impact on \n     youth, and they should use rating systems and marketing codes \n     to reduce the likelihood that underage audiences will be \n     exposed to movies, recordings, or television programs with \n     unsuitable alcohol content, even if adults are expected to \n     predominate in the viewing or listening audiences.\n       (7) Objective scientific evidence and data should be \n     generated and made available to the general public and policy \n     makers at the local, state, and national levels to help them \n     make informed decisions, implement judicious policies, and \n     monitor progress in preventing childhood/adolescent alcohol \n     use.\n       (8) The National Collegiate Athletic Association, its \n     member colleges and universities, and athletic conferences \n     should affirm a commitment to a policy of discouraging \n     alcohol use among underage students and\n\n[[Page S1552]]\n\n     other young fans by ending all alcohol advertising during \n     radio and television broadcasts of collegiate sporting \n     events.\n\n    TITLE II--INTERAGENCY COORDINATING COMMITTEE; ANNUAL REPORT CARD\n\n     SEC. 201.

DODD. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator Mike \nDeWine, to reintroduce legislation designed to prevent our nation's \nchildren and youth from succumbing to the dangers associated with \nunderage alcohol use. The legislation that we introduce today, the \nSTOP, Sober Truth On Preventing, Underage Drinking Act, will greatly \nstrengthen our Nation's ability to combat the too often deadly \nconsequences associated with underage drinking.\n  An initial examination, of the problems presented by underage \ndrinking is truly alarming. Alcohol is the most commonly used drug \namong America's youth. More young people drink alcohol than smoke \ntobacco or use marijuana combined. In 2002, 20 percent of eighth \ngraders had drunk alcohol in the previous 30 days. Forty-nine percent \nof high school seniors are drinkers, and 29 percent report having had \nfive or more drinks in a row, or binged in the past two weeks.\n  Tragically, we know that this year underage drinking will directly \nlead to more than 3,500 deaths, more than two million injuries, 1,200 \nbabies born with fetal alcohol syndrome and more than 50,000 youths \ntreated for alcohol dependence. We also know that the social costs \nassociated with underage drinking total close to $53 billion annually, \nincluding $19 billion from automobile accidents and $29 billion from \nassociated violent crime.\n  And while no one can argue with the tragic loss of life and \nsignificant financial costs associated with underage drinking, too few \nof us think of the equally devastating loss of potential that occurs \nwhen our children begin to drink. Research indicates that children who \nbegin drinking do so at only 12 years of age. We also know that \nchildren that begin drinking at such an early age develop a \npredisposition for alcohol dependence later in life. Such early \nexperimentation can have devastating consequences and derail a child's \npotential just as she or he is starting out on the path to adulthood. \nThe consumption of alcohol by our children can literally rob them of \ntheir future.\n  The truly alarming and devastating effects of underage alcohol use \nare\n\n[[Page S1554]]\n\nwhat initially led Senator DeWine and I to begin work to address this \nimportant issue. Since that time we have worked extensively with \nRepresentatives Roybal-Allard, Wolf, DeLauro, Osbourne and Wamp to \ncraft the broad legislative initiative that we introduce today.\n  The STOP Underage Drinking Act creates the framework for a \nmultifaceted, comprehensive national campaign to prevent underage \ndrinking. Specifically, the legislation includes four major areas of \npolicy development. First, the STOP Underage Drinking Act authorizes $2 \nmillion to establish an Interagency Coordinating Committee to \ncoordinate all federal agency efforts and expertise designed to prevent \nunderage drinking. Chaired by the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services, this committee will be required to report to the \nCongress on an annual basis the extent to which federal efforts are \naddressing the urgent need to curb underage drinking.\n\n  I am particularly pleased that one of the many items in this annual \nreport to Congress will provide for the public health monitoring of the \namount of alcohol advertising reaching our children. I have become \nincreasingly concerned about the degree to which alcohol advertisements \nappear to target our Nation's children. It is my hope that the \nmonitoring called for by this legislation will expose any unethical \nadvertising practices that reach children. We must do all that we can \nto ensure that our children are not exposed to harmful and deceptive \nalcohol promotions.\n  In addition to the federal coordination of federal underage drinking \nprevention efforts, the STOP Underage Drinking Act additionally \nauthorizes $1 million to fund an adult-oriented National Media Campaign \nagainst Underage Drinking. Research indicates that most children who \ndrink obtain the alcohol from their parents or from other adults. The \nNational Media Campaign against underage drinking will specifically \nseek to educate those who provide our children with alcohol about the \ndangers inherent in underage alcohol use. This media campaign will \nbuild upon the valuable underage drinking prevention efforts already \nunderway by the Ad Council, whose campaigns average an estimated $28 \nmillion in donated media from media outlets nationwide.\n  The legislation additionally authorizes $10 million to provide \nstates, not-for-profit groups and institutions of higher education the \nability to create statewide coalitions to prevent underage drinking and \nalcohol abuse by college and university students. This section will \nalso provide alcohol-specific enhancement grants through the Drug Free \nCommunities program.\n  Lastly, the STOP Underage Drinking Act authorizes $6 million to \nexpand research to assess the health effects of underage drinking on \nadolescent development, including its effect on the brain. This effort \nwill additionally increase federal data collection on underage \ndrinking, including reporting on the types and brands of alcohol that \nkids consume.\n  I want to convey my belief that this legislation truly offers a \nhistorical, first step toward addressing the national tragedy \nrepresented by underage drinking. I pledge to work strenuously toward \npassing the STOP Underage Drinking Act and building on its strong \nfoundation and I ask for the support of my colleagues for this \ncritically important initiative.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COLEMAN (for himself, Mr. DeWine, and Mr. Alexander):\n  S. 409. A bill to establish a Federal Youth Development Council to \nimprove the administration and coordination of Federal programs serving \nyouth, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nFederal Youth Coordination Act with my good friends, Senator Mike \nDeWine and Senator Lamar Alexander.\n  The idea for this legislation emanated from the 2003 White House Task \nForce for Disadvantaged Youth report that indicated Federal youth \nprograms were spread across 12 different departments and agencies. It \nidentified 150 programs that served children and youth up to age 21, \nbut also discovered several of these programs were no longer in \nexistence.\n  Today, there is a real need for strong role models in our communities \nto help at-risk youth. As a parent, I know there are a number of things \nthat influence and shape our children's lives and unfortunately \nsometimes there are more negative things than positive. Youth programs \nhelp combat the negative influences and help restore hope, provide \nguidance, and help kids stay on the right track. While we have the \nresources to help our kids, a lack of coordination among youth programs \nhas limited the full potential we have to change lives. Our bill will \nunleash that potential and bring our youth groups to full strength.\n  The Federal Youth Coordination Act will bring efficiency and \naccountability to federal youth policy by developing a Federal Youth \nDevelopment Council. Composed of Department Secretaries, youth serving \norganizations and youth themselves, the Council will coordinate \nexisting federal programs, research and other initiatives, enabling a \nmore comprehensive approach to serving the nation's young people.\n  The purpose of the Council is not to eliminate existing programs, nor \nto create new ones. The Council will ensure communication among youth \nserving agencies, assess the needs of youth, set quantifiable goals and \nobjectives for federal youth programs and develop a coordinated plan to \nachieve those goals. This approach is also cost-effective. The Council \nwill only cost about $1.5 million, and the cost-savings that will be \nachieved through improved efficiency and reduced duplication of efforts \nwill easily recoup those costs.\n  This legislation has bipartisan support and the strong support of our \nnation's youth serving organizations including the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica, the Girl Scouts of America, the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, \nthe YMCA and the Child Welfare League of America. I hope the Senate \nwill be able to act on this important legislation early this year to \nensure our kids have the support they need.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord. \n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 409\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the extension of nondiscriminatory \ntreatment (normal trade relations treatment) to the products of \nUkraine; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the recent ``Orange Revolution'' in \nUkraine marked a huge victory for the advancement of democracy in the \nworld. The Ukrainian people made clear that they would not stand idle \nas a corrupt regime sought to deny them their democratic rights. Now \nthat the people of Ukraine have seized control of their destiny, the \nUnited States must stand ready to assist them as they do the hard work \nof consolidating democracy. The Jackson-Vanik amendment is, with \nrespect to Ukraine, now anachronistic and inappropriate. Therefore, I \nam pleased to introduce legislation that would terminate it.\n  The bill would authorize the President to terminate the application \nof Jackson-Vanik, Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974, to Ukraine. \nUkraine would then be eligible to receive permanent normal trade \nrelations (PNTR) tariff status in its trade with the United States. I \nam pleased to note that Representatives Hyde and Lantos will be \nintroducing an identical bill in the House.\n  Beyond any benefits to our bilateral trading relationship, lifting \nJackson-Vanik for Ukraine constitutes an important symbol of Ukraine's \nnew democracy and its relationship with the United States. I led a \ndelegation of four Senators and six representatives to Kiev last week; \nwhere we met with President Yuschenko, Prime Minister Tymoshenko, and \nstudents who led protests in Independence Square. I was struck by the \ngreat enthusiasm for democracy and freedom that has taken hold in \nUkraine, and I wish the new leaders all the best a they begin the \nchallenge of governing. I pledged to them that I would work toward the \nlifting of Jackson-Vanik on Ukraine, and today I am happy to take the \nfirst step toward that end.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 411. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove the provisions of items and services provided to Medicare \nbeneficiaries residing in States with more cost-effective health care \ndelivery systems; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to again join my colleague, \nSenator Cantwell, in introducing the MediFair Act of 2005. My bill will \nrestore fairness to the Medicare program and provide greater equity for \nhealth providers participating in Medicare. Most importantly, it will \nopen doors of care to more seniors and the disabled in my State.\n  Today, in Washington state, unfair Medicare reimbursement rates are \ncausing doctors to limit their care for Medicare beneficiaries. \nThroughout my State, seniors and the disabled are having a hard time \nfinding a doctor who will accept new Medicare patients.\n  Unfortunately, the Medicare Modernization Act, enacted in 2003, \ncreates even greater inequities for my State. Prior to enactment, \nWashington State was 41st in per beneficiary reimbursement costs. When \nfully implemented, this legislation will push Washington State to 45th \nin per beneficiary costs. This growing inequity places health care \nproviders in my State at an economic disadvantage and further limits \naccess to health care for Washington patients.\n  My bill will reduce the regional inequities that have resulted in \nvastly different levels of care and access to care by ensuring that \nevery state receives at least the national average of per beneficiary \nspending. This measure will encourage more doctors to accept Medicare \npatients and will also guarantee that seniors are not penalized when \nthey choose to retire in the State of Washington. The regional \ninequities in Medicare reimbursement have created a very different \nprogram for my seniors, one that offers them fewer benefits.\n\n[[Page S1556]]\n\n  In addition to ensuring that no state receives less than the national \naverage, my legislation will encourage healthy outcomes and the \nefficient use of Medicare payments. The current Medicare structure \npunishes health care providers who practice efficient health care and \nwho produce higher levels of healthy outcomes. Physicians and hospitals \nin my state are proud of the pioneering role they have played in \nproviding high quality, cost-effective medicine. Unfortunately, instead \nof being rewarded for their exceptional service, they are being \npunished with unfair Medicare payments that only cover a fraction of \ntheir actual costs.\n  I applaud recent efforts by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices (CMS) to direct Medicare resources to performance-based \nmedicine. I believe this effort to reward providers who practice \nperformance-based health care is an important step forward. It's a wise \ninvestment to shift Medicare from a disease-based program, which \nrewards over utilization and medical errors, to a prevention-based \nprogram that encourages healthy outcomes based on performance. It will \nmean better care for seniors and will slow the hemorrhaging of Medicare \ndollars. I am hopeful that CMS will expand these efforts.\n  Performance-based medicine will also begin to close the gap in \nMedicare reimbursement. We must invest in this new approach and begin \nto make changes system wide. In the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act, we \nworked to close the gap between rural and urban providers. I believe it \nis time to take the next step. When doctors and hospitals work to \nimprove outcomes and lower utilization rates they should not be \npunished with unfair Medicare payments.\n  I want to acknowledge the lead sponsor of the MediFair bill in the \nHouse, Congressman Adam Smith, as well as the other House cosponsors, \nCongressman Baird, Congressman McDermott, Congressman Dicks, \nCongressman Inslee, and Congressman Larsen.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 411\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``MediFair Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Regional inequities in medicare reimbursement has \n     created barriers to care for seniors and the disabled.\n       (2) The regional inequities in medicare reimbursement \n     penalize States that have cost-effective health care delivery \n     systems and rewards those States with high utilization rates \n     and that provide inefficient care.\n       (3) Over a lifetime, those inequities can mean as much as a \n     $50,000 difference in the cost of care provided per \n     beneficiary.\n       (4) Regional inequities have resulted in creating very \n     different medicare programs for seniors and the disabled \n     based on where they live.\n       (5) Because the Medicare+Choice rate is based on the fee-\n     for-service reimbursement rate, regional inequities have \n     allowed some medicare beneficiaries access to plans with \n     significantly more benefits including prescription drugs. \n     Beneficiaries in States with lower reimbursement rates have \n     not benefitted to the same degree as beneficiaries in other \n     parts of the country.\n       (6) Regional inequities in medicare reimbursement have \n     created an unfair competitive advantage for hospitals and \n     other health care providers in States that receive above \n     average payments. Higher payments mean that those providers \n     can pay higher salaries in a tight, competitive market.\n       (7) Regional inequities in medicare reimbursement can limit \n     timely access to new technology for beneficiaries in States \n     with lower reimbursement rates.\n       (8) Regional inequities in medicare reimbursement, if left \n     unchecked, will reduce access to medicare services and impact \n     healthy outcomes for beneficiaries.\n       (9) Regional inequities in medicare reimbursement are not \n     just a rural versus urban problem. Many States with large \n     urban centers are at the bottom of the national average for \n     per beneficiary costs.\n\n     SEC. 3. IMPROVING FAIRNESS OF PAYMENTS TO PROVIDERS UNDER THE \n                   MEDICARE FEE-FOR-SERVICE PROGRAM.\n\n       Title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et \n     seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     section:\n\n\n``IMPROVING PAYMENT EQUITY UNDER THE ORIGINAL MEDICARE FEE-FOR-SERVICE \n                                PROGRAM\n\n       ``Sec. 1898.

A bill to reauthorize the Native American Programs Act of \n1974; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwould reauthorize the Native American Programs Act. This Act provides \nauthority\n\n[[Page S1557]]\n\nfor the social and economic development grants that are so critical to \nIndian Country. Senator Inouye joins me in sponsoring this measure.\n  The Native American Programs Act of 1974 is administered by the \nAdministration for Native Americans (ANA) within the Department of \nHealth and Human Services. The purpose of the Act is to promote \neconomic and social self-sufficiency by assisting Native American \ninstitutions and tribal governments to exercise control and decision \nmaking over their own resources; to foster the development of stable, \ndiversified local tribal economies and economic activities that provide \njobs, promote economic well-being, and reduce dependency on public \nfunds and social services; and to support access, control and \ncoordination of services and programs that safeguard the health and \nwell-being of native people that are essential to their communities.\n  The ANA awards annual grants to tribal entities on a competitive \nbasis and provides many native communities with critical startup funds \nfor social, governance, economic, environmental, and cultural programs \nthat are developed by the communities themselves. The program addresses \nkey needs for native communities by helping them begin and expand \nbusinesses, enhancing tribal ability to promote natural environments, \nand preserving and restoring native languages. The Native American \nPrograms Act supports Native American self-governance in the \ndevelopment of economic, social, and governance capacities of Native \nAmerican communities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 412\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 5. A joint resolution expressing the sense of Congress that \nthe United States should act to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a resolution \nwith Senators Snowe, McCain, Chafee, Murray, Jeffords, Durbin, \nLieberman, Leahy, Lautenberg, Boxer, Cantwell, Akaka and Reed that \nurges the Administration to participate in international negotiations \nand actively reduce our greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to \nglobal warming.\n  The Kyoto Protocol goes into effect today. More than 140 nations, \nincluding all 25 members of the European Union, Russia and China, have \nratified the agreement to reduce man-made emissions of greenhouse \ngases.\n  The United States, which accounts for about one-fourth of the \ngreenhouse gases believed responsible for global warming, has refused \nto ratify the treaty.\n  Thirty-five of the world's thirty-eight industrialized countries--\nexcept for the United States, Australia, and Monaco--have ratified this \nimportant treaty.\n  This means that industrialized nations are bound to cut their \ncombined greenhouse gases by 5 percent below 1990 levels between 2008 \nand 2012.\n  The United States is missing an important opportunity to protect our \nplanet's environment by not ratifying the Protocol.\n  I believe this is a huge mistake.\n  There is emerging consensus that global warming is real.\n  According to the National Academy of Sciences, ``Since the 1900s \nglobal average temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration \nhave increased dramatically, particularly compared to their levels in \nthe 900 preceding years.''\n  Scientists now agree on three main Facts about global warming.\n  Fact 1: The Earth is warming.\n  Fact 2: The primary cause of this warming is man-made activities, \nespecially fossil fuel consumption.\n  Fact 3: If we don't act now to reduce emissions, the problem will \nonly get worse.\n  We have already begun to see the impacts of climate change: four \nhurricanes of significant force pounded the state of Florida in a six \nweek period last fall. The storms formed over an area of the ocean \nwhere surface temperatures have increased an average of 17 degrees over \nthe past decade.\n  Eskimos are being forced inland in Alaska as their native homes on \nthe coastline are melting into the sea.\n  Glaciers are beginning to disappear in Glacier National Park in \nMontana. In 100 years, the Park has gone from having 150 glaciers to \nfewer than 30. And the 30 that remain are two-thirds smaller than they \nonce were.\n  In California, water supplies are threatened by smaller snowpacks in \nthe Sierra Nevada. Record snowfalls this winter have provided hope for \nthis summer but the region still could face drought or floods unless \ntemperatures stay cold enough to maintain the snowpack and average \nsnowfall continues for the rest of the precipitation season.\n  If we take strong action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, there \nwill be 27 percent snowpack remaining in the Sierras at the end of the \ncentury.\n  However, if we do nothing to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, \nthere will only be 11 percent snowpack left in the Sierras at the end \nof the century.\n  The San Diego based Scripps Institution of Oceanography, a preeminent \ncenter for marine science research, will release a study later this \nweek showing that global warming will likely have serious ramifications \nin the very near future, including: a water crisis in the western \nUnited States in the next 20 years due to smaller snowpacks.\n  The disappearance of the glaciers in the Andes in Peru in as little \nas 10 years, leaving the population without an adequate water supply \nduring the summer.\n  The melting of two-thirds of the glaciers in western China by 2050, \nseriously diminishing the water supply for the region's 300 million \ninhabitants.\n  Further, the UN Comprehensive Assessment of Freshwater Resources of \nthe World estimates that by 2025, around 5 billion people, out of a \ntotal\n\n[[Page S1558]]\n\nworld population of 8 billion, will not have access to adequate water \nsupplies.\n  And concern about the effects of climate change is mounting around \nthe world.\n  Scientists fear that an ``ecological catastrophe'' is developing in \nTibet with the melting of the region's glaciers as a result of global \nwarming.\n  Glaciers in West Antarctica are thinning twice as fast as they did in \nthe 1990s\n  The mean air temperature has risen 4-5 degrees in Alaska in the past \nthree decades causing glaciers to melt and the coastline to recede.\n  Peru's Quelccaya ice cap, the largest in the tropics, could be gone \nby 2100 if it continues to melt at its current rate--contracting more \nthan 600 feet a year in some places.\n  In addition, according to National Geographic, ``the famed snows of \nKilimanjaro have melted more than 80 percent since 1912. Glaciers in \nthe Garhwal Himalaya in India are retreating so fast that researchers \nbelieve that most central and eastern Himalayan glaciers could \nvirtually disappear by 2035. Arctic sea ice has thinned significantly \nover the past half century, and its extent has declined by about 10 \npercent in the past 30 years. Greenland's ice sheet is shrinking.''\n  The Pew Center for Climate Change reports strong evidence of global \nwarming in the United States. The findings included: the red fox has \nshifted its habitat northward, where it is encroaching on the Arctic \nfox's range.\n  Southern, warm-water fish have begun to infiltrate waters off \nMonterey, California, which were previously dominated by colder-water \nspecies.\n  The Alaskan tundra, which has for thousands of years been a \ndepository for carbon dioxide, has begun to release more of the gas \ninto the air than it removes because warmer winters are causing stored \nplant matter to decompose.\n  There have been documented trends in which the natural timing of \nanimal or insect life cycles changed and the plants on which they \ndepended did not. Many Southern species of butterflies have disappeared \nentirely over the past century as their range contracted.\n  According to the International Climate Change Taskforce, of which \nSenator Snowe is a Co-Chair, if the earth's average temperature \nincreases by more than 2 degres Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, the \nworld could face substantial agricultural losses, countless people at \nrisk of water shortages, and widespread adverse health impacts such as \nmalaria.\n  Even more critically, if the temperature rises more than 3.6 degrees \nFahrenheit, we could be at risk for catastrophic/weather events. For \ninstance, we would risk losing the West Antarctic and Greenland ice \nsheets, which could raise sea levels, shut down the Gulf Stream, and \ndestroy the world's forests.\n  Climate change is real. Its impacts are already being felt. If \nemissions keep growing at projected levels, greenhouse gases in our \natmosphere will reach levels unknown since the time of the dinosaurs \nduring the lifetimes of children born today.\n  That is why my colleagues and I have introduced this resolution that: \nUrges the Administration to engage in international discussions on \npost-Kyoto greenhouse gas reductions.\n  Calls upon the Administration to take action NOW to reduce emissions \ndomestically.\n  Encourages the United States to keep global average temperatures from \nincreasing more than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit over pre-industrial levels.\n  As the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, it is the \nresponsibility of the United States to lead by example. By not \nratifying the Kyoto Protocol, we have sent a harsh message to the world \nthat the largest emitter and contributor to global warming refuses to \nparticipate in a worldwide program aimed at reducing greenhouse gases.\n  But fortunately, even though the federal government has refused to \nacknowledge global warming, many States have recognized that in spite \nof the federal government's inaction, action must be taken.\n  Nearly 40 States have developed their own climate plans.\n  A emission trading system is emerging in the Northeast that will \nrequire large power plants from Maine to Delaware to reduce their \ncarbon emissions.\n  Eighteen States and Washington, DC have enacted renewable portfolio \nstandards. They include Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, \nHawaii, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New \nJersey, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, and \nWisconsin.\n  California has enacted legislation that will reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions from vehicle tailpipes--it is expected that the Northeastern \nStates and Canada will also follow California's lead.\n  Yet without concerted Federal action, the United States will not be \nable to achieve real, significant greenhouse gas reductions.\n  As the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter, we must act now to \nreduce the impacts of climate change and save the environment for \nfuture generations.\n  The Kyoto Protocol ends in 2012. Though the Protocol ends, the United \nStates needs to lead and move to negotiate a post-Kyoto framework. \nThere are many things we can do. For example, we can: use our forests \nand our farmland as a depository for carbon to prevent it from being \nreleased into the atmosphere; develop new technologies such as clean \ncoal, renewable energy, and hydrogen vehicles; make better use of \nexisting technologies such as hybrid vehicles and energy efficient \nbuildings, appliances, and power generation; and use market-based \nprograms, such as cap and trade, to reduce emissions with the least \nharm to economy.\n  Being a responsible steward of the climate is more than just taking \nsteps to pollute less. It also requires participating in international \nnegotiations on the policies the world will need to achieve \nsignificant, long-term reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint resolution be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 5\n\n       Whereas in May 1992, the Senate gave advice and consent to \n     the ratification of the United Nations Framework Convention \n     on Climate Change with the intent of reducing global manmade \n     emissions of greenhouse gases, which committed the United \n     States (along with other developed countries) to a nonbinding \n     target of containing emissions levels at 1990 rates by 2000;\n       Whereas the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \n     Change was signed by President George Herbert Walker Bush and \n     took effect in March 1994;\n       Whereas in December 1997, at the United Nations Framework \n     Convention on Climate Change conference of the parties, the \n     Kyoto Protocol, which set targets for reductions in the \n     greenhouse gas emissions of industrialized countries, was \n     established based on principles described in the 1992 \n     framework agreement;\n       Whereas on February 16, 2005, the Kyoto Protocol will take \n     effect, at which time more than 30 industrialized countries \n     will be legally bound to meet quantitative targets for \n     reducing or limiting the greenhouse gas emissions of those \n     countries, an international carbon trading market will be \n     established through an emissions trading program (which was \n     originally proposed by the United States and enables any \n     industrialized country to buy or sell emissions credits), and \n     the clean development mechanism, which provides opportunities \n     to invest in projects in developing countries that limit \n     emissions while promoting sustainable development, will begin \n     full operation;\n       Whereas 141 nations (including Canada, China, the European \n     Union, India, Japan, and Russia) have ratified the Kyoto \n     Protocol;\n       Whereas the United States is the only member of the Group \n     of 8 that has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol;\n       Whereas, according to the National Academy of Sciences, \n     ``Greenhouse gases are accumulating in Earth's atmosphere as \n     a result of human activities, causing surface air \n     temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures to rise . . . \n     Human-induced warming and associated sea level rises are \n     expected to continue through the 21st century.'';\n       Whereas the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency stated that ``Scientists know for certain that human \n     activities are changing the composition of Earth's \n     atmosphere. Increasing levels of greenhouse gases, like \n     carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere since pre-industrial times \n     have been well documented. There is no doubt this atmospheric \n     buildup of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases is \n     largely the result of human activities.'';\n       Whereas major scientific organizations (including the \n     American Association for the Advancement of Science, the \n     American Meteorological Society, and the American Geophysical \n     Union) have issued statements acknowledging the compelling \n     scientific evidence of human modification of climate;\n\n[[Page S1559]]\n\n       Whereas in 2001, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \n     Change estimated that global average temperatures have risen \n     by approximately 1 degree Fahrenheit in the past century;\n       Whereas the report entitled ``Our Changing Planet: The U.S. \n     Climate Change Science Program for Fiscal Years 2004 and \n     2005'' states that ``Atmospheric concentrations of carbon \n     dioxide and methane have been increasing for about two \n     centuries as a result of human activities and are now higher \n     than they have been for over 400,000 years.'';\n       Whereas according to the Arctic climate impact assessment \n     published in November 2004, the Arctic is warming almost \n     twice as fast as the rest of the planet, and winter \n     temperatures in Alaska have increased approximately 5 to 7 \n     degrees Fahrenheit over the past 50 years;\n       Whereas scientists at the Hadley Centre for Climate \n     Prediction and Research in the United Kingdom have estimated \n     that manmade climate change has already doubled the risk of \n     heat waves, such as the heat wave that caused more than \n     15,000 deaths in Europe in 2003;\n       Whereas scientists at the international conference entitled \n     ``Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change'', held in Exeter, \n     England, from February 1, 2005, through February 3, 2005, \n     predicted that an increase in temperature of 1.8 degrees \n     Fahrenheit (which could occur within 25 years) would cause a \n     decline in food production, water shortages, and a net loss \n     of gross domestic product in some developing countries;\n       Whereas scientists at the international conference entitled \n     ``Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change'' predicted that an \n     increase in temperature of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (which \n     could occur before 2050) could cause a substantial loss of \n     Arctic Sea ice, widespread bleaching of coral reefs, an \n     increased frequency of forest fires, and rivers to become too \n     warm to support trout and salmon, and, in developing \n     countries, would cause an increased risk of hunger, water \n     shortages that would affect an additional 1,500,000,000 \n     people, and significant losses of gross domestic product in \n     some countries;\n       Whereas scientists at the international conference entitled \n     ``Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change'' predicted that an \n     increase in temperature of 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit (which \n     could occur before 2070) would cause irreversible damage to \n     the Amazon rainforest, destruction of many coral reefs, a \n     rapid increase in hunger, large losses in crop production in \n     certain regions, which could affect as many as 5,500,000,000 \n     people, and water shortages that would affect an additional \n     3,000,000,000 people;\n       Whereas scientists at the international conference entitled \n     ``Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change'' predicted that an \n     increase in temperature of greater than 5.4 degrees \n     Fahrenheit (which could occur after 2070) would cause certain \n     regions to become unsuitable for food production, and have a \n     substantial effect on the global gross domestic product;\n       Whereas in the United States, multiple mechanisms \n     (including market cap and trade programs) exist to carry out \n     mitigation of climate change, sequestration activities in \n     agricultural sectors, and development of new technologies \n     such as clean coal and hydrogen vehicles; and\n       Whereas, because the United States has critical economic \n     and other interests in international climate policy, it is in \n     the best interest of the United States to play an active role \n     in any international discussion on climate policy: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,\n       Section 1. That it is the sense of Congress that the United \n     States should demonstrate international leadership and \n     responsibility regarding reducing the health, environmental, \n     and economic risks posed by climate change by--\n       (1) carrying out reasonable and responsible actions to \n     ensure significant and meaningful reductions in emissions of \n     all greenhouse gases;\n       (2) generating climate-friendly technologies by enacting \n     and implementing policies and programs to address all \n     greenhouse gas emissions to promote sustained economic \n     growth;\n       (3) participating in international negotiations under the \n     United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to \n     achieve significant, long-term, cost-effective reductions in \n     global greenhouse gas emissions; and\n       (4) supporting the establishment of a long-term objective \n     to prevent the global average temperature from increasing by \n     greater than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit above preindustrial \n     levels.\n       Sec. 2. The Secretary of State is authorized to and shall \n     engage in efforts with other federal agencies to lead \n     international negotiations to mitigate impacts of global \n     warming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/16/senate-section/article/S1559-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS--MONDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 2005\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 52--HONORING SHIRLEY CHISHOLM FOR HER SERVICE TO THE \n     NATION AND EXPRESSING CONDOLENCES TO HER FAMILY, FRIENDS, AND \n                        SUPPORTERS ON HER DEATH\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON (for herself and Mr. Levin) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Res. 55\n\n       Whereas leading reformist and former Chinese Communist \n     Party Secretary General, Zhao Ziyang, died under house arrest \n     in China on January 17, 2005, at the age of 85;\n       Whereas Zhao implemented important agricultural, \n     industrial, and economic reforms in China and rose to the \n     prominent positions of premier and Secretary General within \n     the Communist Party despite criticisms of his capitalist \n     ideals;\n       Whereas, in the early summer of 1989, students gathered in \n     Tiananmen Square to voice their support for democracy and to \n     protest the Communist government that continues to deny them \n     that democracy;\n       Whereas Secretary General Zhao advised against the use of \n     military force to end the pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen \n     Square;\n       Whereas, on May 19, 1989, in Tiananmen Square, Zhao warned \n     the tens of thousands of students clamoring for democracy \n     that the authorities were approaching and urged them to \n     return to their homes; an action that illustrated his \n     sympathy for their cause;\n       Whereas Zhao was consequently relieved of all leadership \n     responsibilities following his actions in Tiananmen Square \n     that summer and was placed under house arrest for the \n     remaining years of his life;\n       Whereas the Government of China remained indecisive \n     regarding a ceremony for Zhao for several days before \n     allowing a relatively modest ceremony at the Babaoshan \n     Revolutionary Cemetery in Beijing, where Zhao was cremated on \n     January 29, 2005;\n       Whereas the Government of China's fear of civil unrest \n     resulted in the prohibition of political dissidents and \n     others from the funeral, and the thousands who were in \n     attendance were surrounded in an intimidating environment \n     without adequate time to mourn and grieve;\n       Whereas news of Zhao's death was announced only in a brief \n     notice by the Communist government and was forbidden to be \n     covered by the radio or national television, while eulogies \n     were erased by censors from memorial websites;\n\n[[Page S1560]]\n\n       Whereas, upon the announcement of Zhao's death, Chinese \n     news agencies were certain to reference the ``serious \n     mistake'' committed by Zhao at what they refer to as a \n     political incident in 1989;\n       Whereas mourning the death of Zhao in the Hong Kong \n     Legislative Council was deemed unconstitutional and lawmakers \n     in Hong Kong were refused the opportunity to observe a moment \n     of silence in honor of his life;\n       Whereas the death of Zhao has renewed the desire of certain \n     Chinese people for a reassessment of the crackdown in 1989 in \n     order to acknowledge the merit of pro-democracy student \n     demonstrations and complaints of government corruption; and\n       Whereas Zhao will continue to serve as a symbol of the \n     dreams and purpose of the 1989 Tiananmen Square \n     demonstration, which survived the Tiananmen massacre but \n     which have still not been realized for the people of China: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes that Zhao Ziyang made an important \n     contribution to the people of China by providing assistance \n     to the students in Tiananmen Square in 1989, and that through \n     this contribution and his decisions to actively seek reform, \n     Zhao remains a symbol of hope for reform and human rights for \n     the people of China;\n       (2) expresses sympathy for Zhao's family and to the people \n     of China who were unable to appropriately mourn his death or \n     to celebrate his life;\n       (3) calls on the Government of China--\n       (A) to release all prisoners of conscience, including those \n     persons still in prison as a result of their participation in \n     the peaceful pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in \n     1989;

Res. 57\n\n       Whereas Mucopolysaccharidosis (``MPS'') and Mucolipidosis \n     (``ML'') disorders are genetically determined lysosomal \n     storage disorders that result in the body's inability to \n     produce certain enzymes needed to breakdown complex \n     carbohydrates;\n       Whereas these complex carbohydrates are then stored in \n     virtually every cell in the body and progressively cause \n     damage to these cells, adversely affecting an individual's \n     body, including an individual's heart, respiratory system, \n     bones, internal organs, and central nervous system;\n       Whereas the cellular damage caused by MPS often results in \n     mental retardation, short stature, corneal damage, joint \n     stiffness, loss of mobility, speech and hearing impairment, \n     heart disease, hyperactivity, chronic respiratory problems, \n     and most importantly, a drastically shortened life span;\n       Whereas the nature of the disorder is usually not apparent \n     at birth;\n       Whereas without treatment, life expectancy of an individual \n     afflicted with MPS is usually very early in life;\n       Whereas recent research developments have resulted in \n     limited treatments for some MPS disorders;\n       Whereas promising advancements are underway in pursuit of \n     treatments for additional MPS disorders;\n       Whereas despite newly developed remedies, the blood brain \n     barrier continues to be a significant impediment to \n     effectively treating the brain, thereby preventing the \n     treatment of many of the symptoms of MPS;\n       Whereas treatments for MPS will be greatly enhanced with \n     continued public funding;\n       Whereas the quality of life for individuals afflicted with \n     MPS and the treatments available to them will be enhanced \n     through the development of early detection techniques and \n     early intervention;\n       Whereas treatments and research advancements for MPS are \n     limited by a lack of awareness about MPS disorders;\n       Whereas the lack of awareness about MPS disorders extends \n     to those within the medical community;\n       Whereas the damage that is caused by MPS makes it a model \n     for many other degenerative genetic disorders;\n       Whereas the development of effective therapies and a \n     potential cure for MPS disorders can be accomplished by \n     increased awareness, research, data collection, and \n     information distribution;\n       Whereas the Senate is an institution than can raise public \n     awareness about MPS; and\n       Whereas the Senate is also an institution that can assist \n     in encouraging and facilitating increased public and private \n     sector research for early diagnosis and treatments of MPS \n     disorders: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates February 25, 2005, as ``National MPS \n     Awareness Day''; and\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of ``National MPS \n     Awareness Day''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/16/senate-section/article/S1560-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1560-S1561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 56--DESIGNATING THE MONTH OF MARCH AS DEEP-VEIN \n    THROMBOSIS AWARENESS MONTH, IN MEMORY OF JOURNALIST DAVID BLOOM\n\n  Mr. SPECTER submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to submit \na resolution to designate March 2005, as Deep Vein Thrombosis Awareness \nMonth.\n  Deep vein thrombosis, DVT, affects more than two million Americans \neach year, according to the American Heart Association. DVT is a \ncondition that occurs when a blood clot forms in one of the large \nveins, usually in the lower limbs. These blood clots can grow in size, \nbreak loose, travel through the bloodstream and obstruct a pulmonary \nartery, resulting in a pulmonary embolism, PE, a sudden blockage of an \nartery in the lung, which can cause sudden death. According to the \nAmerican Heart Association, up to 2 million Americans are affected \nannually by DVT. Up to 200,000 people die as a result of PE, 98 percent \nof which are complications brought on by DVT.\n  Deep vein thrombosis may best be known for its effects on those who \nfly for long periods of time. Sitting for many hours without getting up \nand moving around makes blood flow in the legs slow down, increasing \nthe tendency for blood to clump and form blood clots. However, this \ncause of DVT accounts for only a small percentage of the DVT cases in \nthe United States. DVT can strike anyone, anywhere. Americans who have \nor have had cancer or certain heart or respiratory diseases may be at \nincreased risk for DVT. Americans are also at risk if they are \noverweight, elderly, bed-ridden, or have had a stroke.\n  Unfortunately, 74 percent of Americans have little or no awareness of \nDVT, according to a national survey sponsored by the American Public \nHealth Association. DVT and its complications also take a toll on our \nNation's hospital systems, costing approximately $860 million annually.\n  Among DVT's many victims was NBC News correspondent David Bloom. In \nMarch and April 2003, David, only 39 years old, was embedded with the \nU.S. Army's 3rd Infantry Division covering the war in Iraq. On April 6, \n2003, after being seated in a cramped Army vehicle for many hours, \nDavid was stricken with DVT. The blood clot had traveled to his lungs \nand proved fatal.\n\n[[Page S1561]]\n\n  Like David Bloom, many of us may be at risk for DVT and not know it. \nSome risk factors include: acute medical illness such as cancer, \ncertain heart or respiratory diseases, prior DVT, increasing age, \nobesity, major orthopedic surgery, pregnancy, restricted mobility and \nparalysis. DVT can be prevented through maintaining a healthy \nlifestyle, including a fitness program and a healthy diet. Further, \nduring periods of prolonged immobility such as airplane travel, stretch \nyour legs as often as possible.\n  As Chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I led the effort to double funding for the \nNational Institutes of Health (NIH) over 5 years. Funding for the NIH \nhas increased from $11.3 billion in fiscal year 1995 to $28.5 billion \nin fiscal year 2005. In 2004, the NIH, through the National Heart, \nLung, and Blood Institute, provided $6.1 million for DVT and PE \nresearch. The NIH is also advancing research of this condition through \na recently formed international partnership working to prevent and \ncontrol blood clots, and improve therapies for conditions such as heart \nattacks, strokes, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolisms.\n  Together with Melanie Bloom, widow of David Bloom, and the more than \n35 leading health organizations in the Coalition to Prevent DVT, we are \nworking to help raise awareness of this condition. To increase public \nawareness of this serious, yet preventable condition, I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation to designate March 2005 as Deep \nVein Thrombosis Awareness Month in honor of David Bloom's memory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/16/senate-section/article/S1561-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 13.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Deciphering the sequence of the human genome and other \n     advances in genetics open major new opportunities for medical \n     progress. New knowledge about the genetic basis of illness \n     will allow for earlier detection of illnesses, often before \n     symptoms have begun. Genetic testing can allow individuals to \n     take steps to reduce the likelihood that they will contract a \n     particular disorder. New knowledge about genetics may allow \n     for the development of better therapies that are more \n     effective against disease or have fewer side effects than \n     current treatments. These advances give rise to the potential \n     misuse of genetic information to discriminate in health \n     insurance and employment.\n       (2) The early science of genetics became the basis of State \n     laws that provided for the sterilization of persons having \n     presumed genetic ``defects'' such as mental retardation, \n     mental disease, epilepsy, blindness, and hearing loss, among \n     other conditions. The first sterilization law was enacted in \n     the State of Indiana in 1907. By 1981, a majority of States \n     adopted sterilization laws to ``correct'' apparent genetic \n     traits or tendencies. Many of these State laws have since \n     been repealed, and many have been modified to include \n     essential constitutional requirements of due process and \n     equal protection. However, the current explosion in the \n     science of genetics, and the history of sterilization laws by \n     the States based on early genetic science, compels \n     Congressional action in this area.\n       (3) Although genes are facially neutral markers, many \n     genetic conditions and disorders are associated with \n     particular racial and ethnic groups and gender. Because some \n     genetic traits are most prevalent in particular groups, \n     members of a particular group may be stigmatized or \n     discriminated against as a result of that genetic \n     information. This form of discrimination was evident in the \n     1970s, which saw the advent of programs to screen and \n     identify carriers of sickle cell anemia, a disease which \n     afflicts African-Americans. Once again, State legislatures \n     began to enact discriminatory laws in the area, and in the \n     early 1970s began mandating genetic screening of all African \n     Americans for sickle cell anemia, leading to discrimination \n     and unnecessary fear. To alleviate some of this stigma, \n     Congress in 1972 passed the National Sickle Cell Anemia \n     Control Act, which withholds Federal funding from States \n     unless sickle cell testing is voluntary.\n       (4) Congress has been informed of examples of genetic \n     discrimination in the workplace. These include the use of \n     pre-employment genetic screening at Lawrence Berkeley \n     Laboratory, which led to a court decision in favor of the \n     employees in that case Norman-Bloodsaw v. Lawrence Berkeley \n     Laboratory (135 F.3d 1260, 1269 (9th Cir. 1998)). Congress \n     clearly has a compelling public interest in relieving the \n     fear of discrimination and in prohibiting its actual practice \n     in employment and health insurance.\n       (5) Federal law addressing genetic discrimination in health \n     insurance and employment is incomplete in both the scope and \n     depth of its protections. Moreover, while many States have \n     enacted some type of genetic non-discrimination law, these \n     laws vary widely with respect to their approach, application, \n     and level of protection. Congress has collected substantial \n     evidence that the American public and the medical community \n     find the existing patchwork of State and Federal laws to be \n     confusing and inadequate to protect them from discrimination. \n     Therefore Federal legislation establishing a national and \n     uniform basic standard is necessary to fully protect the \n     public from discrimination and allay their concerns about the \n     potential for discrimination, thereby allowing individuals to \n     take advantage of genetic testing, technologies, research, \n     and new therapies.\n\n         TITLE I--GENETIC NONDISCRIMINATION IN HEALTH INSURANCE\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 57, which was submitted earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 57) designating February 25, 2005, as \n     National MPS Awareness Day.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \nrecognizing February 25 as ``National MPS Day.'' This resolution enjoys \nstrong bipartisan support in the Senate. I am also pleased that a \nsimilar resolution is being introduced this week in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  MPS, or Mucopolysaccharidosis, is a devastating disease that affects \nthousands of families in this country. Most often diagnosed in young \nchildren, MPS patients lack certain enzymes to break down complex \ncarbohydrates in their bodies. These complex carbohydrates then are \nstored throughout the patient's body, causing many of the body's' \nsystems to malfunction and, sadly, makes it difficult for these \nchildren to live long enough to reach adolescence.\n  It is a parent's role to make sacrifices for their child; yet, for \nthe parents of a child diagnosed with MPS, the sacrifices are \nexceptional. I have had the opportunity to meet with a number of \nparents of MPS children. These parents exhibit amazing hope, love, \ngrace and humor that can often mask the many trials they undergo in \ncaring for\n\n[[Page S1578]]\n\ntheir children. My staff and I are constantly impressed at their \nability to advance their cause while also selflessly caring for their \nchildren.\n  The current president of the National MPS Society, Sissi Langford, is \na South Carolinian. She and her husband have two children with MPS, Joe \nand Maggie. Sissi has been a passionate advocate for her children and \nall those who suffer from MPS. She has worked with my office for the \npast two years and has proved herself time and again to be \nknowledgeable, compassionate and committed to helping those who have \nbeen diagnosed with MPS. She worked with others in the National MPS \nSociety to help include language in the latest reauthorization of the \nIndividual with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) to help address the \nneeds of children who have been diagnosed with degenerative diseases. \nShe has met with the National Institutes of Health and other top health \npolicy makers to ensure that diseases in the same class as MPS are \ngiven adequate and necessary research attention. I commend Sissi and \nothers like her, for their tireless work on behalf of MPS.\n  It is my hope that this resolution will help advance the recognition \nof MPS, and therefore the attention given in the research realm. I am \nalso hopeful that the Senate will pass this resolution marking February \n25 National MPS Day.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 57\n\n       Whereas Mucopolysaccharidosis (``MPS'') and Mucolipidosis \n     (``ML'') disorders are genetically determined lysosomal \n     storage disorders that result in the body's inability to \n     produce certain enzymes needed to breakdown complex \n     carbohydrates;\n       Whereas these complex carbohydrates are then stored in \n     virtually every cell in the body and progressively cause \n     damage to these cells, adversely affecting an individual's \n     body, including an individual's heart, respiratory system, \n     bones, internal organs, and central nervous system;\n       Whereas the cellular damage caused by MPS often results in \n     mental retardation, short stature, corneal damage, joint \n     stiffness, loss of mobility, speech and hearing impairment, \n     heart disease, hyperactivity, chronic respiratory problems, \n     and most importantly, a drastically shortened life span;\n       Whereas the nature of the disorder is usually not apparent \n     at birth;\n       Whereas without treatment, life expectancy of an individual \n     afflicted with MPS is usually very early in life;\n       Whereas recent research developments have resulted in \n     limited treatments for some MPS disorders;\n       Whereas promising advancements are underway in pursuit of \n     treatments for additional MPS disorders;\n       Whereas despite newly developed remedies, the blood brain \n     barrier continues to be a significant impediment to \n     effectively treating the brain, thereby preventing the \n     treatment of many of the symptoms of MPS;\n       Whereas treatments for MPS will be greatly enhanced with \n     continued public funding;\n       Whereas the quality of life for individuals afflicted with \n     MPS and the treatments available to them will be enhanced \n     through the development of early detection techniques and \n     early intervention;\n       Whereas treatments and research advancements for MPS are \n     limited by a lack of awareness about MPS disorders;\n       Whereas the lack of awareness about MPS disorders extends \n     to those within the medical community;\n       Whereas the damage that is caused by MPS makes it a model \n     for many other degenerative genetic disorders;\n       Whereas the development of effective therapies and a \n     potential cure for MPS disorders can be accomplished by \n     increased awareness, research, data collection, and \n     information distribution;\n       Whereas the Senate is an institution than can raise public \n     awareness about MPS; and\n       Whereas the Senate is also an institution that can assist \n     in encouraging and facilitating increased public and private \n     sector research for early diagnosis and treatments of MPS \n     disorders: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates February 25, 2005, as ``National MPS \n     Awareness Day''; and\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of ``National MPS \n     Awareness Day''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/16/senate-section/article/S1578-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1578-S1579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PAYING TRIBUTE TO JOHN HUME\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 54\n\n       Whereas John Hume is one of the greatest advocates of peace \n     and non-violence of our time;\n       Whereas throughout the long and difficult years of civil \n     strife and turmoil, John Hume has dedicated his life to \n     achieving a peaceful, just, and lasting settlement of the \n     conflict in Northern Ireland;\n       Whereas throughout the turbulent years in Northern Ireland, \n     John Hume never lost faith in the belief that violence and \n     terrorism are wrong, that a negotiated settlement is the only \n     realistic hope for peace, and that ancient antagonisms cannot \n     be settled by bombs and bullets;\n       Whereas John Hume deserves enormous credit for the peace \n     process in Northern Ireland, which led to the 1998 Good \n     Friday Agreement;\n       Whereas John Hume's enduring vision of reconciliation, \n     based on equal respect and recognition for both the \n     Protestant and Catholic traditions in Northern Ireland, has \n     served as an inspiration to those seeking peaceful resolution \n     of conflicts in many other parts of the world;\n       Whereas John Hume has worked consistently for the rights of \n     the members of his community, beginning with the launching of \n     a credit union to provide assistance to the minority \n     community to purchase housing;\n       Whereas John Hume's commitment was to effective programs \n     and peaceful works, at a time when others in his community \n     increasingly urged or acquiesced to bombs and bullets;\n       Whereas John Hume's ideas and eloquence lit a candle in the \n     darkness of the violence in Northern Ireland, kindled an \n     increasing sense of hope in the minority community, and \n     created new possibilities for understanding between the \n     opposing sides of the conflict;\n       Whereas John Hume's community activity and involvement led \n     directly to his long and distinguished political career;\n       Whereas John Hume brought together a broad coalition of \n     leaders who advocated non-violence and together they founded \n     the Social Democratic and Labour Party in 1970, which has \n     been at the forefront of years of significant efforts to \n     achieve peace in Northern Ireland;\n       Whereas John Hume was the first to emphasize the necessity \n     of establishing an on-going Anglo-Irish framework as the \n     cornerstone for institutionalizing the process of \n     reconciliation to heal the divisions within Northern Ireland, \n     between North and South in Ireland, and between Great Britain \n     and Ireland;\n       Whereas in 1983, largely as a result of the efforts of John \n     Hume, the principal political parties in Ireland and the \n     Social Democratic and Labour Party in Northern Ireland \n     established the far-reaching New Ireland Forum;\n       Whereas the New Ireland Forum developed alternatives for \n     progress and prepared the report that laid the groundwork for \n     an unprecedented new dialogue on Northern Ireland between \n     Britain and Ireland, culminating in November 1985 with the \n     signing of the historic Anglo-Irish Agreement by Prime \n     Minister Margaret Thatcher of the United Kingdom and \n     Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald of Ireland;\n       Whereas John Hume conducted talks with Gerry Adams, the \n     leader of Sinn Fein, before the Irish Republican Army agreed \n     to a cease-fire, showing great courage by taking significant \n     personal and political risks to achieve a lasting peace;\n       Whereas those talks, together with the December 1993 Joint \n     Declaration by the British and Irish Governments, led to the \n     August 1994 cease-fire by the Irish Republican Army and the \n     October 1994 cease-fire by the Loyalist paramilitaries and \n     ultimately to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998;\n       Whereas John Hume served as the Deputy Leader of the Social \n     Democratic and Labour Party in Northern Ireland until 1979, \n     and its leader from 1979 to 2001;\n       Whereas John Hume's political career has also included \n     serving as a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly, the \n     European Parliament, and the British House of Commons;\n       Whereas in his many visits to the United States, John Hume \n     has been a consistent\n\n[[Page S1579]]\n\n     ambassador for peace, urging the cause of reconciliation and \n     educating Congress and the country about the issues in \n     Northern Ireland;\n       Whereas John Hume is well respected in the United States \n     and has had an important influence on United States policy \n     and on the American dimension of the Northern Ireland \n     question;\n       Whereas John Hume is a courageous leader of exceptional \n     achievement and was honored for his leadership in the cause \n     of peace in Northern Ireland with the Nobel Peace Prize in \n     1998, along with the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, \n     David Trimble;\n       Whereas respect for John Hume was the single most important \n     influence in the development of the Friends of Ireland in the \n     United States Congress and in convincing leaders of the \n     Irish-American community throughout the United States to \n     oppose political, financial, or other support for the \n     violence in Northern Ireland; and\n       Whereas John Hume is retiring this year after a long and \n     brilliant career dedicated to the people of Northern Ireland \n     and to the cause of peace: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) pays tribute to John Hume for his lifetime commitment \n     to promoting reconciliation and achieving a lasting peace in \n     Northern Ireland; and\n       (2) calls on all the parties in Northern Ireland to \n     redouble their effort to restore the trust that is necessary \n     to fully implement the Good Friday Agreement and to achieve \n     stable democratic institutions, peace, and justice in \n     Northern Ireland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"},

I wonder if the \nleader has any indication of whether we can take this matter up \nsometime in the near future.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the antilynching bill has been referred to \nthe Judiciary Committee, which has not yet considered that bill. I \nbelieve there is another bill by Senator Alexander also yet to be \nconsidered at the committee level. Over the course of tomorrow, we can \ndiscuss how we might handle both of those. Typically, it would be \nthrough the regular order, since it has been referred to the Judiciary \nCommittee. Over the course of the morning, I will be happy to have \ndiscussions with Senators Landrieu and Alexander, as I did yesterday, \non the matter. They are both important issues. Both are issues that are \na little separate but address the same large issue. I look forward to \nbeing able to address those. Not going through regular order would \nrequire a unanimous consent on behalf of this body. We can discuss that \nwith the leadership over the course of the morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Thus, we will vote on this important \nbill tomorrow.\n  This bill protects Americans from having their genetic information \nused against them by potential employers, or by their employer, or to \nbe used in a discriminatory fashion by insurance companies, for \nexample. A number of people have been very involved before the Senate \nover the last 7 years on this bill. I just mentioned Senators Snowe, \nEnzi, Kennedy, and a number of others. Tomorrow, there will be others \nwho wish to discuss the bill, and we encourage them to do so while we \nare in morning business or later tomorrow afternoon. We will vote on \nthe bill at 3 o'clock tomorrow.\n  It is my hope that the Senate will also act on the State high-risk \nhealth insurance pools bill and the committee funding resolution. We \nwill continue to work with Members on both sides of the aisle in order \nto clear these items for floor consideration tomorrow.\n  As a reminder to our colleagues, on Friday morning, Senator Burr will \ncarry out a long-held Senate tradition by reading George Washington's \nFarewell Address.\n  Again, I thank all Members for their assistance on the genetic \nnondiscrimination bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/16/senate-section/article/S1579-3", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
