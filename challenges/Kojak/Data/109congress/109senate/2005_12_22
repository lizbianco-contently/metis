Mr. President, last night we passed the Department of \nDefense Appropriations Conference Report. We all know how important \nthat bill is to our country and our troops. Prior to passing that bill, \nwe were successful in removing provisions to allow drilling in the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge. Those provisions had no place in that \nbill.\n  As was noted on the floor last night, there were other provisions \nthat did not belong in the conference report. They were not included in \nthe House- or Senate-passed bills. They were not at all related to the \nDepartment of Defense's appropriations. In fact, conferees had been \nassured that these provisions would not be included at all.\n  But Republican leaders swept in and declared that they would be \nincluded, in violation of promises and the rules. And that is not the \nworst part. The provisions themselves bestow on drug companies sweeping \nimmunity from the consequences of reckless wrongdoing. It was the \nRepublican leadership's big Christmas present to their friends in the \ndrug industry.\n  This immunity extends to all aspects of the development and \nproduction of drugs or vaccines so long as they are used to prevent, \ntreat, or diagnose what the administration declares an ``epidemic.'' \nRepublican leaders have insisted that these provisions are about \npreparing for pandemic flu or bioterrorist attack. They are exploiting \nour fears to go well beyond that.\n  What is an ``epidemic''? Secretary Leavitt recently said obesity is \nan ``epidemic.'' Many have said diabetes, heart disease, and \nmethamphetamine addiction are epidemics. And it gets worse. The \nprovisions also apply to any product that mitigates the side effects of \na drug used to counteract an epidemic. That could include pain or high \nblood pressure medication.\n  Even reckless or grossly negligent drug companies will not be held \nresponsible for the injuries they cause. The provisions in the \nconference report only allow for an injured patient to hold a drug \ncompany responsible if he or she can prove using clear and convincing \nevidence that the company acted with ``willful misconduct.'' This \nburden is virtually impossible to meet.\n  This gift to the drug companies comes at the expense of injured \npatients and the success of our future programs to ensure vaccinations. \nThe provisions establish a ``compensation fund,'' but provide no money \nfor it. Patients who are injured by products covered under this \nlegislation will find that because there is no money in the fund, there \nis no compensation.\n  Under this administration's watch, the absence of a promise of \ncompensation resulted in the failure of the program to vaccinate first \nresponders for smallpox. The legislation we passed last night creates \nthe same problem and condemns future similar vaccination programs to \nfailure. Who can blame people for saying no when we are asking to take \nthe risks of what may be an adverse effect if they are not assured that \nwe will take care of them?\n  Mr. President, the inclusion of these policies in the DOD \nAppropriations bill was not just bad form, it was bad for Americans. I \nstrongly opposed their inclusion. And I am strongly committed to \nrevisiting this damage in the first days of our return.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/22/senate-section/article/S14424-5", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wholeheartedly support the \nprovisions of the Department of Defense appropriations bill that \nprovide money for our brave military men and women. I support the much \nneeded 3.1 percent pay increase. And I support the Blackhawk MEDEVAC \nand Utility Helicopters, and Wireless Communication Systems for \nMontana's National Guard.\n  But this was not a clean bill. Although I voted for the bill, I take \noffense to a number of provisions that have nothing to do with our \ntroops. These additions should never have been included in the Defense \nbill in the first place. They don't belong here.\n  We have focused our discussion over the past few days on drilling in \nAlaska. And I am proud that our defense bill does not include ANWR.\n  But in objecting to ANWR, we have forgotten other changes in the \nconference report, last minute additions that have no place in a \ndefense bill. I am referring to the Public Readiness and Emergency \nPreparedness Act.\n  The Emergency Preparedness Act virtually eliminates liability for \npharmaceutical companies. Now drug companies have wholesale immunity \nexcept in the case of ``willful misconduct.'' Drug companies will no \nlonger be held responsible for negligence or recklessness. Only if they \nhad actual knowledge that their product would injure or kill someone \nwould we hold them accountable.\n  The Emergency Preparedness Act also sets up an unfunded compensation \nfund. Without any money appropriated to the fund, the fund is \ninoperable. This could allow drug companies to remove themselves from \nresponsibility without providing the American people with the recourse \nthey deserve.\n  Although I support the Defense bill we passed, I do not support the \nEmergency Preparedness Act. This section was added at the last minute. \nAnd it only passed because all of us in the Senate wanted to provide \nsupport for our troops.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/22/senate-section/article/S14424-6", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14424-S14425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 8:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby\n\n[[Page S14425]]\n\nMr. Hays, announced that the House has passed the following bill, in \nwhich it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 4647.
