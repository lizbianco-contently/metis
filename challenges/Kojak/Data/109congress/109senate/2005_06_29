Last night we reached an agreement which provides for debate and \nvotes on the final amendments. We will start off with two amendments \nrelating to pesticides. If all time is used on those two amendments, we \nwill be voting at approximately 12:30. I hope we will not need all that \ndebate time, but that we can expedite some of the votes in order to \nfinish the bill at an early hour today. We will be voting on the bill \nthroughout the day on the remaining amendments to the Interior bill. We \nwill finish the bill today.\n  As a reminder to my colleagues, we need to keep things moving as \nefficiently as we possibly can because we have a lot of other work to \nconsider this week, including the Homeland Security bill, possibly the \nCAFTA legislation, a highway extension, in all likelihood a welfare \nextension, and there are other appropriation measures and nominations \nthat may become available for Senate consideration.\n  I know we have a lot of Members who are traveling and, specifically \nfor BRAC reasons, are going back to their States. But we need to keep \nvoting, keep the amendments coming forward to make progress for the \nAmerican people.\n  We have today, Thursday, and Friday to accomplish a great deal. I \nencourage my colleagues to come to the floor. If you don't need \nextended debate, please take into consideration that we have a lot to \ndo to finish this bill today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/29/senate-section/article/S7543-8", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, through the Chair to the distinguished \nmajority leader, it is my understanding that sometime this morning \nCAFTA will be marked up and likely come out of committee. Is that the \nleader's understanding?\n  Mr. FRIST. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. REID. As the leader mentioned, we are going to go to Homeland \nSecurity appropriations next, is that right?\n  Mr. FRIST. That is the plan, although right now the Interior bill is \ntaking an extra day, a day longer than I thought, so we are going to \nhave to adjust the schedule appropriately given the fact the Interior \nbill was not finished yesterday as we had anticipated.\n  Mr. REID. As I spoke to the leader, because Senator Domenici and I \nhave done the bill for so long, if we needed to do a bill in a shorter \nperiod of time, an appropriations bill, I think we could do ours in a \nday at the longest. I don't anticipate any trouble with that.\n  As I said privately and now I say publicly, I think we have a \ntremendous obligation to see what we can do to move appropriations \nbills. Before we leave, I would like to get two of them done. When we \nget back in July, after the obligations that you and I have set up--\nstem cells, China trade, native Hawaiians--then I hope we could get \nsome more appropriation's bills done, but I know that is a big order.\n  In relation to what the majority leader has said, I do not think \nanyone should plan on staging their votes\n\n[[Page S7544]]\n\nwhen they think there are going to be a lot of people here, when \neverybody will be here, because all week we will have a lack of \nattendance. People are flying all over the country attending BRAC \nhearings. That will be the way it is all week long.\n\n  I think we have to plow forward and try to get as much done as we can \nas soon as we can because we do have the Fourth of July festivities \naround the country starting as early as Saturday.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in part in response to the distinguished \nDemocratic leader, the week right now, with just Wednesday, Thursday, \nFriday--we have a lot to do. He looked ahead to next month. Again, that \nis the short list. We have a possible flag amendment, we have a \npossible gun liability, so July--in addition to stem cells and the \nothers he mentioned, in addition to the appropriations. I say all that \nbecause we have Members who, on Mondays and Fridays say, We are not \ngoing to be there.\n  This Friday, even though it is before a recess, we are going to be \ngone and we will have the opportunity to go back to our States and do \nall the things that are very important for us to do. But we need to \nkeep plowing through, working Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. I made \nit clear to my caucus if it is necessary we will be voting Friday. I \ndon't want to give a time on Friday, but our colleagues right now in \ntheir minds say, well, it is Thursday, time to get out, we are on \nrecess, and therefore we are not going to stick around.\n  I want to put our side on notice, and I hope the distinguished \nDemocratic leader will do likewise, because we have the appropriations \nbills--and I think there are several, Energy and Water--legislative \nbranch should not take much time, but we have a number of others that \nwill. Homeland Security is probably going to take some time to do. I \nagain encourage our colleagues to offer amendments today, let's finish \nthis bill, and then move on to other business. Then also, Friday, if we \ncan't finish our business, we are going to need to be voting on Friday.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep concern \nabout the President's proposal to peg initial Social Security benefits \nto the growth in prices rather than wages, and the negative impact this \nso-called progressive price indexing scheme would have on future \nretirees.\n  The current method of calculating retirees' Social Security benefits \nwas first put into place in 1979. Since then, the initial benefit level \nhas risen with the growth in wages, ensuring that benefits reflect \nincreases in living standards over time. Wages tend to grow faster than \nprices, so the effect of the President's proposed change would be a \nsubstantial reduction over time in initial benefit levels to people \nmaking more than $20,000 per year.\n  Two recent reports by the Democratic staff of the Joint Economic \nCommittee indicate the extent of the benefit cuts that future retirees \nwould face under the President's proposal. The first report, entitled \n``What If President Bush's Plan For Cuts In Social Security Benefits \nWere Already In Place?'' finds that if a price indexing approach like \nPresident Bush's had gone into effect in 1979 instead of the current \nmethod, middle-class workers retiring this year would receive a benefit \n9 percent smaller than they will get under current law.\n  This chart illustrates that for 65-year-olds, if we had adopted in \n1979 this indexing proposal, they would be receiving roughly $1,400 \nless per year than they would under the current system. The current \nsystem replaces wages. It keeps up with a growing standard of living. \nIt keeps seniors out of poverty and able to afford all their expenses. \nThis chart illustrates the fact that these cuts would have been very \nreal and very significant.\n  This second chart indicates that Social Security under the \nPresident's plan will replace a smaller percentage of wages because it \nwould be tied to prices, not wages. This chart also shows that if in \n1979 we had adopted progressive price indexing rather than wage \nindexing--for 65-year-olds, they would be receiving upon retirement 4 \npercent less than under current law, but for the 45-year-olds, the drop \nis significant. In effect, we are not keeping up with the cost of \nliving. We are not keeping up with the standard of living. That is the \nessence of the President's proposal.\n  What we are seeing with this proposal is another way to cut benefit \nlevels for seniors. It will affect, if it is put in place, not just the \nseniors who are retiring after that date, the 65-year-olds, but the \nwhole generation of Americans who will follow.\n  Price indexing would also hit middle-income workers much harder than \nupper income workers because middle-income workers rely on Social \nSecurity for a much larger percentage of their retirement income than \ndo upper income workers. While the highest earners retiring until 2045 \nwould experience a bigger benefit cut, their total retirement income \nwould fall by less.\n  This chart shows what would happen to a 25-year-old if the \nPresident's proposal had been adopted in 1979. For the medium earner, \nthey would see a 26-percent reduction in Social Security benefits, but \nit would translate into a 17-percent reduction in their overall \nretirement income because they don't have many alternate sources to \nSocial Security to rely on when they retire. Upper income workers would \nsee a cut in benefits that is larger, but again their overall \nretirement income and benefits would be cut much less. So the impact \nreally hits the medium worker if this scheme is advanced.\n  There is a second report the Democratic staff of the Joint Economic \nCommittee has done, entitled ``How President Bush's Social Security \nProposals Would Affect Late Baby Boomers.'' There has been a lot of \ntalk about how the President's proposal would not affect those 55 and \nabove, but there is a whole large group of Americans--ages 40 to 45, \nsometimes called the late baby boomers--who would be significantly \nimpaired by the proposal.\n  This chart shows the impact on benefits for today's 40-year-olds, \nthose who are at the beginning of this late baby boom period. Under \ncurrent law, they could expect retirement--these are medium-income \nearners, making $36,600 in 2005--they could expect annual benefits of \n$17,000. The President's plan cuts it to $15,450 if his benefit \nindexing plan alone is adopted.\n  With private accounts, it is further reduced to $12,470, if you adopt \na very safe Treasury security investment approach--which, again, for \nthe 40 and 45-year-olds, just 20 years or so from retirement, is \nprobably the best, safest approach--you would still get less money than \nthe current law benefit. The impact of progressive indexing, even with \nthe private accounts, would be to reduce the benefits middle-income \nworkers would receive.\n\n  Over all, this whole approach is one that will reduce benefits for \nmiddle Americans. It is one that, if it had been placed in effect in \n1979, we would already see significant cuts in benefits to our seniors. \nI don't think there is any senior out there complaining they are \nreceiving too much in their Social Security check. If this approach was \nadopted in 1979, they would be receiving on the order of 10 percent \nless, and their financial constraints would be even more severe.\n  There is another aspect to this whole issue of pension benefits and \nSocial Security. In the past 25 years, there has been a major shift \naway from traditional defined benefit plans to defined contribution \nplans. This chart shows the late baby boomers are already assuming more \nof the risk in investing their own retirement assets than older \ngenerations. This line of the chart represents all pension plans, which \nthis line shows defined benefit plans that essentially have been flat \nover many years, going back to 1980, to 1998, and beyond. The third \nline of the chart we see is the rise of defined contribution plans.\n  Most plans are offered to newer workers as they come into the \nworkforce. These younger workers are assuming more of the risk of their \nretirement. They are assuming it under the defined contribution plans. \nAs a result, they do not have the certainty that older generations of \nAmericans had. They had the certainty of two defined benefit plans--one \nfrom their factory\n\n[[Page S7545]]\n\nworkplace, office place, their private defined benefit plan; and the \nsecond, of course, is from Social Security.\n  As we consider cutting benefits from the defined benefit plans, we \nare putting additional pressure on young Americans and middle-aged \nAmericans who now see most of their assets tied up in defined \ncontribution plans. The middle-income workers, the middle-aged workers \nof today, and the younger workers of today will face a future with less \ncertainty and less security than other generations have enjoyed. That \nis another strong argument against using a progressive index to cut the \none defined benefit plan most Americans can still count on--Social \nSecurity.\n  In addition, the President's price indexing proposal does not close \nthe 75-year gap between promised Social Security benefits and the taxes \nexpected to be paid into the system. It falls short by about 25 \npercent. Adding on private accounts would worsen Social Security \nsolvency and increase the Federal debt enormously. If price indexed \nbenefits were combined with private accounts, future generations would \nface the double burden of large cuts in their guaranteed Social \nSecurity benefits and paying down a much higher debt.\n  We all want to work with President Bush to promote a system of Social \nSecurity that is solvent, that will encourage savings throughout the \nUnited States. But we have to find a plan that works, that does not \npenalize, particularly, the middle-income Americans.\n  We have to also address not just the issue of Social Security but the \nissue of private pensions. We are seeing tremendous pressure on our \nprivate pension plans. When you have huge companies such as United \nAirlines trying to eliminate their pension obligations through the \nPension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, that is a wakeup call. Twenty \nyears ago, no one thought when they got a job at United they would have \nto worry about their pension. That would be the last thing on their \nminds. Today, United workers and many workers in many other fields \nworry desperately about their private pensions. We have to pay \nattention to that. I argue that is probably a more pressing problem \nthan the solvency issues of Social Security.\n  We hope to work with the President to devise a system to ensure the \nsolvency of Social Security but a system that does not unduly penalize \nworking middle-class Americans. I hope we can do that. From my \nperspective, it is incumbent, of course, that we move away from the \nissue of private accounts that certainly makes the system less solvent \nand does not provide sufficient benefits, particularly for Americans 40 \nyears and older, and that we move to looking at other issues. I hope we \ncan do that. Our commitment should be to ensure we have a Social \nSecurity system that works for all Americans and provides that true \nsense of security: People can count on it, it will be there, and it \nwill be sufficient to support them when they are old.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. VITTER).

Last night, President Bush stood in front of the soldiers \nof the 82nd Airborne and the members of the Special Forces and gave an \nimportant speech. Thankfully, he did not profess the unfounded optimism \nof Vice President Cheney, who recently declared that the Iraqi \ninsurgency was in ``its last throes.'' Nor did he express the \npessimistic view of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, who said this \nlast Sunday that this insurgency had an expected life of 5 to 12 years, \nadding he hoped the American troops could come home long before that.\n  In fact, Mr. Bush did not use the word ``insurgency,'' although that \nis what is raging in Iraq. That insurgency is partially fueled and \nfinanced from outside groups. Those who come to Iraq to fight in this \ninsurgency come from Saudi Arabia, Syria, and many other places. There \nis also a domestic war within Iraq against Americans and against many \nother Iraqis.\n  President Bush did not use the word ``insurgency,'' but he did make \nat least six references to September 11. He said that he was drawing on \nthe lessons of September 11. Well, on September 12, 2001, the day after \nthe tragedy of September 11, virtually the whole world stood with the \nUnited States. One of the most important lessons I would draw from \nSeptember 11 is that we can't afford to waste the support of friends \nand allies.\n  President Bush says he will not set a timetable. I understand that. I \nrecognize the danger of posting a date and announcing that on that \nspecific day, America will leave. But the fact is, the Iraqi people \nhave their own timetable which they established. By August 15 of this \nyear, they are charged with drawing up a constitution. By next \nFebruary, they are to have adopted that constitution. These are clear \ndeadlines, clear benchmarks. We do not need a timetable for withdrawal, \nbut America needs a strategy for success with clear benchmarks.\n  The President announced nothing new last night. He repeated what he \nsaid before about the ultimate goal in Iraq of establishing democracy \nand bringing our troops home. He did not give any sign that he sees a \nneed to change course.\n  In Iraq, 1,744 American soldiers have died in combat. Almost 13,000 \nhave been grievously wounded. The insurgency continues. Insurgents are \nnow using more sophisticated roadside bombs that can even pierce our \narmored vehicles. Our troops have done everything we have asked of \nthem, but for each insurgent they kill, another seems to spring up, \neither from the cities and towns of Iraq or slipping across the porous \nborder. For every IED that our soldiers detect and destroy, another one \nseems to be planted in its place, sometimes within hours.\n  There is an estimate that in Iraq today, unguarded, there are some \n800,000 tons of ammunition and armament. It is a free market, a flea \nmarket, a bazaar of deadly weapons for insurgents and those who would \nuse them against our troops. That is what our brave men and women are \nup against.\n\n  The streets are not safe for our troops. The streets are not safe for \nIraqis. Without security, it is unlikely the Iraqis have much faith in \na new government.\n  Unemployment levels in Iraq are as high as 50 percent. Without jobs, \nthe Iraqis wonder what their future will be. More of the same is not \ngood enough.\n  Our soldiers are doing everything right, everything that we ask of \nthem. They are learning and adapting to the situation on the ground. \nTheir Commander in Chief needs to do the same. We need benchmarks that \nwill measure progress in security, reconstruction, governance, and \ninternational savings. And we need to ask ourselves, What do we do next \nif the benchmarks are not met?\n  Yesterday, a letter was sent by Senator Carl Levin and Senator Susan \nCollins to the President urging him to include in the speech an \naccountability of the Iraqi Government, saying that they must hold to \ntheir deadlines, they must understand that this is serious and that we \nare not going to stay there indefinitely. A New York Times editorial \nrecently stated, ``If the war is going according to plan, someone needs \nto rethink the plan.'' I believe they are right.\n  Finally, we also need to take better care of our soldiers when they \ncome home. We are going to have an amendment in a few moments offered \nby Senator Patty Murray of Washington. Make no mistake, she has been \nour leader in the Senate when it comes to funding for the Veterans' \nAdministration. Time and again in the Committee on the Budget, with the \nbudget resolution and with the supplemental appropriations, she has \nmade the argument that there wasn't enough money in the VA to take care \nof our returning soldiers and veterans from other wars. She has been \nignored, rejected, and criticized for standing up and saying the \nobvious--that we have a debt to our soldiers and our veterans.\n  Last week, Senator Murray was vindicated. The Veterans' \nAdministration announced they made a gross miscalculation and were at \nleast $1 billion short in the money they need right now to provide \nquality health care to our soldiers and veterans.\n\n[[Page S7546]]\n\n  Senator Murray has fought the good fight, and she will win that fight \ntoday. In fact, it is going to be interesting to see many from the \nother side of the aisle who were critical of her call for more money \nfor the VA rushing to provide even greater sums so they can argue that \nthey are on the side of the VA and the veterans.\n  This is the way it should end. This debate should end with Senator \nMurray's leadership creating a bipartisan coalition for the Veterans' \nAdministration. This should have been a bipartisan issue from the \nstart. She was a lonely voice and faced a lot of criticism for a long \ntime. Today, she will be vindicated. More importantly, the veterans \nwill receive the quality health care which they deserve. That means the \nnewly returning veterans of Fallujah and Baghdad, many suffering \nterrible wounds in battle and some facing invisible wounds of post-\ntraumatic stress disorder, will have a chance for the kind of treatment \nthey deserve at the Veterans' Administration.\n  The administration, when it comes to the Veterans' Administration as \nwell as waging the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, has not anticipated the \nreal costs of war. We can do better. We owe these men and women who are \nfighting these battles and those who have fought in past wars not only \nour thoughts and prayers, we owe them our resources so they can wage \nthis war successfully, come home safely, and return to their families \nand their lives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank my colleague from Illinois \nfor his dedication to this issue and his tremendous work and support as \nwe have tried to raise this issue for a number of months.\n  So all of my colleagues know, I came to the floor of the Senate early \nthis year to talk about the situation facing those soldiers who have \nworked so honorably for this country in past wars and for those who are \nreturning home from Iraq and Afghanistan today and the need to keep the \npromise that we gave to all of them that when they return we will \nprovide them with the health care they need.\n  When I was in my State earlier this year, in January, I met with a \nnumber of the service organizations and the military to talk about \nreintegration, to talk about what happens to our soldiers when they \nreturn home, to make sure they have the services available to them, and \nto make sure they are taken care of. Many in those meetings were deeply \nconcerned that we would not have the facilities available for them. \nThey told me of already long waiting lines at our veterans clinics and \nour VA hospitals. They told me of soldiers who could not get \nappointments for as many as 6 months or 3 years. They told me of a \nlooming budget crisis.\n  When I heard that, I talked to other organizations across the country \nand realized that we were, indeed, facing a tremendous shortfall at the \nVA. That is why in the Committee on the Budget I offered an amendment \nto increase the funding for VA. It was rejected by those on the \nmajority side by an almost party-line vote. That is why, throughout the \nappropriations process and then on the emergency supplemental, I \ncontinued to come to the Senate to say that this is a looming crisis \nthat we need to deal with.\n  In the Senate, I offered an amendment for $1.98 billion for an \nemergency supplemental, saying this is critical. Our soldiers are not \ngetting the care they need. I was defeated on that amendment on an \nalmost party-line vote because of the letter sent by the Secretary of \nVA to Kay Bailey Hutchison, the Senator who is the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Military Construction, saying they do not indicate a \ndire emergency. He said:\n\n       I can assure you that the VA does not need emergency \n     supplemental funds in fiscal year 2005 to continue to provide \n     the timely quality service that is always our goal.\n  Based on that letter, many on the other side voted against my \namendment because they believed the Secretary was being honest with \nthem. Well, I continue to raise this specter saying we are going to \nface a crisis. Even several weeks ago, in a Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs hearing, the Secretary of the VA came before our committee and \nonce again said there is no budget crisis.\n  Well, last Thursday, finally the truth came out. The VA told us they \nwere well over $1 billion short in funding for this year. What was \ntheir solution? Their solution was to go back into this year's \nappropriations that have already been approved by this body, for which \nwe already have the money flowing to construction and maintenance \nprojects throughout the country--these are projects for seismic \nupgrades in our VA facilities, for asbestos abatement, for hazardous \nwaste cleanup, for clinics that are being built where contracts are \nalready let--and the VA is saying: We are going to take money away from \nthose projects.\n  We cannot allow that to happen. These contracts are already being \nlet. These facilities already need the maintenance. It has already been \ndeferred for 2 years. We cannot go back to our States and tell these \nclinics: Gee, sorry. There was a mistake made at the VA. They didn't do \nthe calculations correctly. You are not going to get the services.\n  That is not the promise we made to our men and women when we sent \nthem overseas. We said we will be there. We said we will be there. That \nis a promise we need to keep now, as we face this budget crisis.\n  We looked at the VA and said, ``How could you make such a mistake?'' \nparticularly when I was raising the specter of this for the past 6 \nmonths and knew from the ground, knew from looking at the VA's own \nnumbers, that they were going to be facing this crisis.\n  Yesterday, Secretary Nicholson came before the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs and said they had assumed that only 25,000 veterans from Iraq \nand Afghanistan would seek care at the VA in this fiscal year. Instead, \nwhat they have seen is 103,000 veterans already--already. And, as we \nknow, many are still there, many more are to go, many more to be \nreturning.\n  So the Committee on Veterans' Affairs was basing their calculations \non 2002 numbers rather than saying, as we all know, that we are at war, \nthat over a million men and women have been sent to Iraq and \nAfghanistan. They are in what the generals call a 360-degree war, \nmeaning there are intense times for each one of those soldiers, 24/7, \nknowing, when they return, they will need help for mental health care \nand post-traumatic stress disorder. The VA never took that into \naccount. They never looked at the world of what was happening and said: \nWe are going to have increased costs for Veterans Affairs because we \nhave more veterans returning.\n  So I find it appalling that the VA, the VA Secretary, and those who \nare required to be giving us honest numbers failed to look past their \nown desks and recognize what all of us throughout the country know; \nthat is, we have a high number of veterans returning who need both \nphysical care and mental health care. It is our job to appropriate the \nmoney to take care of them.\n  So where are we today? Senator Byrd and I and others on this side are \noffering an amendment on the Interior appropriations bill that we will \nbe debating later this afternoon to add, again, $1.42 billion as an \nemergency supplemental to provide the funding for this year. I am very \nproud of the Members of this Senate who have stood time and again to \nsay we need to be there for our soldiers who are returning from war, \nand we need to do it responsibly.\n  Senator Craig, the chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, \ntold me, when we were on the floor debating this during the \nsupplemental, when he used Secretary Nicholson's letter to justify \nvoting no against my amendment, that if he was proved wrong, he would \nbe out here to work with me to provide the funds.\n  I commend Senator Craig and Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison for coming \nto the plate now and saying we need to\n\n[[Page S7547]]\n\ndeal with this, this year. They will be offering a second-degree \namendment to my amendment this afternoon to add $80 million so we can \nprovide the funds for this year. I am happy to join with them in making \nsure this body adopts that amendment, as well as the underlying Murray \namendment, to the Interior bill so we can deal with this crisis today.\n  That is the responsible thing to do. The irresponsible thing to do is \nto say we can take care of this by moving the budget numbers; we can \ntake care of this with budget gimmicks; we can ignore this; we can \npaper this over.\n  We have done that already for far too long. I commend my colleagues \non the other side for now joining with us to say we need an emergency \nsupplemental to provide the dollars for our veterans when they return \nhome to make sure the facilities are there. No gimmicks, no just \ntalking about it; we are going to do the right thing in the Senate \nbody.\n  We now have to follow that through. We will have to make sure the \nHouse of Representatives comes to the table in negotiations and works \nwith us to get this done. And I call on the President and the White \nHouse now to recognize this crisis, as well, and to not gloss over it, \nnot to paper it over but to work with us to pass an emergency \nsupplemental.\n  Every one of us is going to go home for the Fourth of July recess. \nEvery one of us is either going to be in parades or talk to veterans or \nbe out there making sure the country knows we are so proud of the men \nand women who are serving us regardless of how we voted on the war. \nEvery Member of this body and every citizen in this country is proud of \nour soldiers and the work they have done for us.\n  We can show them that we keep our promises, today on the floor of the \nSenate, by passing the Murray amendment and the second-degree amendment \nthat is going to be offered by the Senators from the other side to keep \nthat commitment. We then have the responsibility to make sure the House \nof Representatives works with us to pass this as well and that the \nWhite House takes it on as a priority.\n  I listened to the President of the United States, last night, address \nthis country. I listened to his impassioned plea to stay the course. \nWhat I did not hear was the President calling on the American public to \nmake the sacrifice that is necessary in war. That sacrifice includes \nmaking sure we keep the promise to the men and women we are asking to \nserve in the war overseas, by being there to provide the health care \nservices they will need when they come home and not in facilities that \nare falling down or crumbling, not with equipment that is failing, not \nwith shortages and lines, but with real care and not just for the \nveterans who are returning home today but for the veterans who served \nus in prior conflicts.\n  Today, we are seeing an increase in the number of veterans in our VA \nfacilities because--no surprise--the veterans from the Vietnam war are \nnow reaching the age where they need additional health care dollars. \nThose figures have to be taken into account at the VA. They cannot bury \ntheir heads in the sand and look at reports from 10 years ago. They \nneed to be real about what the costs are today. When we pass this \namendment, we will hopefully get the President to work with us on an \nemergency supplemental to provide those funds. I will work with any \nSenator on this floor to make sure our Committee on Veterans' Affairs \nlooks at the real numbers we need so we can project into the future the \nreal costs and make sure we are doing the right thing on this end of \nPennsylvania Avenue, to make sure we are providing the funds that our \nservice men and women need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does have a minute remaining.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, last night, when I listened to the \nPresident of the United States, he called on the American public--he \ncalled on all of us--asking our young men and women to consider service \nto our country overseas. Part of that commitment is not just asking \nthem to serve but being there for them.\n  He also called on all of us to put our flags up on the Fourth of July \nand to be proud as Americans and to honor those who are serving us and \nto tell them we are proud of them by raising our flags.\n  The other thing we can do is adopt this amendment on the supplemental \nand get the White House to agree with us to make it an emergency to \nprovide the services that are necessary. We will raise our flags, we \nwill honor our veterans, we will be proud of our soldiers, but we will \nalso be there to take care of them when they come home.\n  That is what the Murray amendment will do today. I am proud to join \nwith Senator Craig, Senator Hutchison, and others from the other side \nto do what is right. I call on the other Members of Congress, as well \nas the White House, to join us in this effort.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to start this morning by \nfinishing something that Senator Murray just talked about and say that \ntoday the Veterans' Administration is going to step to the plate, along \nwith Members of the Senate.\n  Senator Murray has been so helpful in working out some agreements \nthat will allow us to pour another $1.5 billion into the veterans \nprograms. We will talk more about that later today. But Senator \nSantorum, Senator Kyl, Senator Craig, myself, Senator Murray, Senator \nByrd, and Senator Rockefeller have come together as a united front to \nassure that veterans who are coming back from this war in Iraq and \nAfghanistan are not shortchanged. This is the way we should work with \nthe administration and the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/29/senate-section/article/S7547-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7547-S7550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I do want to start our morning \nbusiness time to talk about the President's speech last night, when he \nwas talking to those wonderful soldiers at Fort Bragg, NC, and laying \nout for the American people not only the victories and the successes we \nare having in Iraq but also talking about the hard pull that we are \nmaking, that those soldiers are making.\n  I thought the President's candor was refreshing. He did not say: This \nis all hunky-dory. He said this is a long, hard road. He said: In the \nbeginning, I said it would be. It has certainly proven to be. I think \nhe was candid about exactly where we are, that we have had some great \nsuccesses, and we have had some setbacks. Certainly, the vote of the \nIraqi people was a huge success. That has set the stage for the next \nphase of trying to secure Iraq and making a difference in the Middle \nEast.\n  When people talk about what is happening in Iraq, I do not think we \nhear enough about how much better off the Iraqi people are today. Oh, \nyes, it is hard to see suicide bombers taking innocent lives. It is. \nBut remember how many innocent lives were taken by Saddam Hussein.\n  When Saddam Hussein was taking innocent lives, there was no hope for \nthose people. There was no way out. Today innocent lives are being \ntaken, but they are not being taken in vain. They are being taken in a \ncause for freedom that will end in democracy for Iraq. That is what the \nPresident laid out last night. The President has taken the Iraqi people \nfrom a despot who was torturing and killing innocent people--sometimes \nfor sport--and is turning Iraq into a country that is trying to get its \nown feet on the ground and establish the roots of democracy.\n  When I look at some of the improvements that are being made in Iraq \nthat I hear about from our armed services personnel returning from \nIraq--and I have been to Iraq, but I always like to talk to the people \nwho have been there most recently--when I talk to the young men and \nwomen on their R leave in the middle of their term, then I see that \nthere are roads being built. The oil industry is being repaired. The \nelectricity grids are being restored and improved. Schools are being \nopened. The Iraqis see Americans teaching in the schools and providing \nmedical care, rebuilding their infrastructure. Within\n\n[[Page S7548]]\n\na year after the fall of Saddam Hussein, electricity generation was \nhigher than prewar levels, and it has increased since then. Water \nsupplies have been repaired and sewage systems have been fixed. It is \nincredible the progress that has been made.\n  We have to look at the big picture. What the President was saying \nlast night is that we are on the cusp of beginning to show people \nthroughout the Middle East that self-governance is something all people \ncan achieve. We are beginning to see the seeds of that self-governance \ntoday.\n  Our distinguished assistant leader, Senator McConnell, is here. I \nwant him to have his full 5 minutes, so I will close my remarks.\n  I am proud that our President especially chose to go to Fort Bragg, \nNC, and give his report to the American people in front of those \nwonderful soldiers who are protecting freedom for America, just as \nthose in World War I and World War II did. The people of America will \nstay the course. We will protect freedom for our children, and we are \nbeing led by our President to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the situation in \nIraq. President Bush, last night, reiterated America's commitment and \nresolve to finishing the job in Iraq. First, I think the President made \nit clear how high the stakes are in Iraq by demonstrating that Iraq is \nfront and center in the global war on terror. Just listen to Osama bin \nLaden. Bin Laden is quoted as saying: ``The whole world is watching \nthis war'' and that the Iraq war will result in either ``victory and \nglory or misery and humiliation.'' Al-Qaida certainly recognizes how \nhigh the stakes are. So do our European allies.\n  German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said the other day that ``[t]here \ncan be no question a stable and democratic Iraq is in the vested \ninterest of not just Germany, but also Europe.'' That was Schroeder, \nwho was not exactly a cheerleader for the Iraq war.\n  Yet we continue to hear the refrain from some quarters that it is \ntime to cut and run, that we should set arbitrary deadlines for \nwithdrawal, to get out while we can. If September 11 taught us \nanything, it is that retreating in the face of terrorism and hoping for \nthe best is not the way to protect American lives. Quite the opposite. \nIt is a display of weakness, and it is an invitation to America's \nenemies. As the President forcefully conveyed last night, we must take \nthe fight to the enemies, or they will take the fight to us on our \nshores and on their terms.\n  Second, the President outlined a clear plan regarding the future of \nour engagement in Iraq. He explained his two-tier strategy there, \ninvolving both the democracy building side and the military side of the \nequation.\n\n  On the democracy building side, the President rightly reminded the \nAmerican people of the important progress that has been made in just 1 \nyear. The terrorists, for all of their heinous acts, simply could not \ninterrupt the transfer of sovereignty, nor could the terrorists derail \nthe January elections. The Iraqi people were too determined to move \ntheir country forward. The Iraqi people cast their ballots for freedom \nand democracy and against terrorism. In so doing, the Iraqi people set \nan example other democracy activists in the Middle East have begun to \nfollow. The Iraqi people are also moving forward in the drafting of \ntheir constitution, which their political leaders have publicly \ndeclared will indeed be completed by the August 15 deadline.\n  On the military side, President Bush discussed his new approaches to \ntraining the Iraqi security forces to fight the enemy and defend \nfreedom. Some in this country belittled the Iraqi security forces. They \nhave been running them down. Frankly, I find this reprehensible. More \nthan 2,000 members of the Iraqi security forces have laid down their \nlives defending freedom in their country, fighting alongside our \ntroops, and more Iraqis keep enlisting every single day. These \nvolunteers are Iraqi patriots, and the President was right to \nacknowledge the supreme sacrifice made by these friends of freedom.\n  Iraq has two ways it can go. We can leave the country to be preyed \nupon by murderers who want to turn the country into a Taliban-like \nnation, a haven for terrorist camps, and a factory of hatred, or we can \nstand and fight by defending liberty and democracy in Iraq and \ndemonstrating an alternative to the ways of terror and of Saddam \nHussein. We can help Iraqis help themselves and, in the process, help \nthe United States by making the Middle East a more democratic and \npeaceful region. And when Iraq is strong enough to stand up on its own \ntwo feet and Iraqi security forces can fully defend their own country, \nour troops will stand down and come home.\n  Third, the President rightly noted the progress that is being made on \nthe ground. The elite media in our country, however, is always focusing \non bad news. They teach them in journalism school that only bad news is \nnews. You would never know, for example, that more than 600 Iraqi \nschools have been renovated to date, or that construction is underway \nat 144 new primary health care facilities across that country. You \nwon't find that written about in the elite media.\n  Finally, I was pleased to see the President pay tribute to our brave \nmen and women in uniform. They are an inspiration to all of us, and I \nam confident that the American people throughout our great land will \ntake up the President's invitation to honor them over the Independence \nDay holiday.\n  Our work in Iraq is challenging, but it is a noble endeavor, an \nendeavor in which progress is being made every single day--a message \nPresident Bush delivered very clearly last night.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nArizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  The President's remarks last night on the 1-year anniversary of \nhanding power over to the Iraqi Government was a good opportunity to \nremind Americans why it is so critical that we stay the course in Iraq. \nInterestingly, just a year ago, there was one Iraqi battalion. Today \nthere are 100 Iraqi battalions. That is a good metaphor for what we are \ndoing there and how we are going to succeed. And it is a good answer to \nthose who say we need a plan. We need an exit strategy.\n  People who talk about that have not been listening to the President. \nHis plan, as he outlined last night, is simple, and it is a plan that \nwe have been following since over a year ago, when the transfer of \npower occurred. The plan is to enable the Iraqis to take over the \nsecurity of their own country, and then we can leave. We are not going \nto leave before that job is done. No one knows exactly how long it will \ntake, but the fact that we have increased a hundredfold the number of \nIraqi units in the year since we turned over power is a good indication \nof what we intend to do and what we have been able to do.\n  The President noted last night that not all of these units are \ntrained to the same level that the U.S. units are. That is obvious. But \nas we are able to do so, those Iraqi units will be able to take over \nmore and more of the operation.\n  Eventually, as the President noted last night, the United States \nmight be able to do more by simply embedding some of our officers in \nthose units, thus reducing, again, the amount of American manpower \nactually on the ground.\n  There is a way that the United States is approaching this that will \nresult in the United States withdrawing and the Iraqis being able to \ntake care of their own security. That is the plan, and it is a wise \none.\n  What is at stake if we were to either announce an early withdrawal or \npull out early? The President made it clear last night that you don't \nannounce to the enemy when you are going to leave. The enemy simply \ntakes note of that and says, fine, waits until you leave, and then does \nall the bad stuff that it wants to do without any fear of retribution \nby the United States. That is not workable. Nor would it be workable \nfor the United States to pull out too soon.\n  Think about what would happen. If the terrorists were to take back \nover in\n\n[[Page S7549]]\n\nIraq, even Saddam Hussein could be returned to power. That would become \na hot bed of terrorism in the Middle East. The progress that has been \nmade in surrounding countries such as Pakistan, the efforts that are \nbeing made toward democracy in places such as Lebanon and Egypt and \nSaudi Arabia, all of those would go up in smoke. The problems that a \ncountry such as Pakistan would have would be horrendous. Countries such \nas Syria and Iran would decide that to be on the winning side, they \nwant to continue their support of the terrorists. Our credibility would \nbe absolutely destroyed. An opportunity to create a democracy in that \npart of the Middle East would have evaporated.\n  I can't think of anything worse than losing in Iraq. And since \nvictory is within our grasp, we need to pursue that course.\n  The President was on the right track last night. There will be some \nwho will never respond favorably toward his message because they are \nsimply in such disagreement with him politically that they can't force \nthemselves to acknowledge anything that he does is correct or good. \nThose people are not going to be persuaded. But the vast majority of \nAmericans who were listening will appreciate the fact that we do have a \ngood strategy, that the President is not trying to engage in happy \ntalk. He repeatedly said this was going to be difficult. But it is also \nimportant for him to point out the successes because the news media is \nnot likely to do that as fully as it should.\n  The President combined both a sober assessment of the realities, a \npragmatic assessment, along with a good report of the progress that has \nbeen made, and we believe will continue to be made.\n  In all of these things, I believe President Bush should be \ncomplimented and that we, as a nation, should join behind him, just as \nthe soldiers and the families of the soldiers at Fort Bragg did last \nnight. It was evident to me that they support the President. It is \nimportant that the American people and we support the President as \nwell.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, how much time remains on the \nRepublican side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Approximately 14 minutes remain.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to Senator Stevens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. President, yesterday marked the 1-year anniversary of the \ntransfer of sovereignty to the people of Iraq. We now stand at a \ncrucial point in history. We can see how far we have come, but we know \nthe final chapter has not been written. This is the time to take stock, \nboth of our challenges and our achievements.\n  Many ignore the good news in Iraq, but there is good news. And we \ncan't prepare for the road ahead without a balanced picture of where we \nare today. In the past year, there have been many accomplishments which \nstand as milestones on the paths of progress. Since the transfer of \nsovereignty, thousands of Iraqis have answered the call to serve their \ncountry. The Iraqi security force now numbers over 168,000, and another \n50- to 70,000 Iraqis serve as site protection personnel.\n  By October, the number of trained Iraqi security personnel will reach \n200,000.\n  This time last year only one Iraqi battalion was capable of \ndeploying. Today, more than 100 stand ready.\n  In the past year, the Iraqi Government has taken shape. In January, \nmore than 8 million Iraqis voted in free and fair elections for the \nfirst time in 50 years.\n  Today, Iraq has an interim constitution with checks and balances, \nseparation of powers, and protection for individual rights, and women \nare involved.\n  The Iraqi National Assembly is drafting a new constitution, which is \non schedule to be released on August 15. The Government is preparing \nfor the October referendum on the constitution, and they are planning \nfor a new set of elections which will be held in December.\n  Freedom has begun to take root in Iraq. Political parties, civil \nsociety groups, and a free press have emerged. A government once \nshrouded in secrecy now answers directly to the people and communicates \nwith them through Iraqi newspapers, television, and radio stations.\n  In the past year, the reconstruction has moved forward. Many of these \nsuccessful projects are part of the Commander's Emergency Response \nProgram, a tool that enables our men and women on the ground to fund \nsmall-scale projects that have an immediate and visible impact on the \nlives of the Iraqi people.\n  This month, for the first time since October 2004, the electricity \nsupply exceeded 100,000 megawatt hours. On average, 12 hours of power \nare now available across the nation each day.\n  More than 94 water treatment projects are underway. And we have \nbroken ground on 144 new primary health care facilities across the \ncountry.\n  In the past year, 628 schools have been renovated. Another 86 are now \nunder construction.\n  The international community has rallied around the new Iraqi \nGovernment. Just last week more than 80 nations and organizations from \naround the world attended the International Conference on Iraq in \nBrussels. The Iraqi Government shared their vision, and the \ninternational community reaffirmed their commitment to help Iraq secure \nits future.\n  I list these accomplishments because we must remember the path to \nprogress is slow and steady. With the televised reports of car bombings \nand other terrorist attacks, it is easy to lose sight of the goals we \nhave already reached.\n  Some of us have recently called upon President Bush to keep the \nAmerican people informed so our constituents understand what we are \ndoing and know how we plan to proceed. My concern has been that rising \nsentiments about the continued redeployment of Reserve and National \nGuard units could jeopardize the important work we are doing in Iraq \nand Afghanistan.\n  Last night, President Bush answered our calls for more information. \nIn a speech before the American people, he outlined his strategy for \ncompleting the mission. Now, it is time to rededicate ourselves to the \nchallenges that remain.\n  We still have work to do in Iraq. Today, the Iraqi Government has \ncontrol of Najaf and Fallujah. The insurgents have lost their safe \nhavens. Unable to expand their operations, they have resorted to acts \nof terrorism and targeted innocent Iraqi civilians. These are the facts \nof desperate men--men whose only comfort is the hope that we will lose \nour will and weaken our resolve.\n  The only way we can lose in Iraq is if we defeat ourselves--if we \nfail to stay the course. The American people--and those of us who have \nbeen chosen to represent them--cannot let that happen.\n  Americans do not abandon friends in hard times. We do not run from \nthe duty and responsibility of history. Our will does not waver. Our \nresolve does not break.\n  More than 2 years ago, I joined many of you and supported the \nPresident's bipartisan resolution to commence this action in Iraq. When \nthe Senate debated the resolution, I urged my colleagues to support it. \nI came to the floor of this Chamber and said: ``A new history of \ninternational courage can be written now.''\n  I repeat this call today--our Nation must have the courage to help \nthe Iraqi people write the next chapter of their proud history in which \nthe seeds of democracy--which have been sown by the Iraqi people and \nnurtured by the sacrifices of our men and women in uniform--will grow \ninto a strong, free Iraq.\n  I urge the Senate not to divide over Iraq. Some continue to compare \nthis situation to the one we faced in Vietnam. Iraq is not Vietnam. \nThose who make this comparison ignore the history.\n  I outlined the differences between these two conflicts in April and \nwill not reiterate each of those differences today. The simple fact is \nwe are in Iraq for reasons entirely different from the reasons we went \ninto Vietnam. We can and will successfully conclude our operations in \nIraq.\n  We must succeed. The stakes are high. Iraq is the central front in \nthe war on terror. By their own admission, what terrorists fear most is \na free, stable and democratic Iraq.\n\n[[Page S7550]]\n\n  Over a year ago, we intercepted a message Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a \nterrorist in Iraq, sent to Osama bin Laden. In the message, al-Zarqawi \nsaid, ``The future has become frightening'' for terrorists because \ndemocracy has gained a foothold in Iraq. He told Osama bin Laden, \n``Democracy is coming and there will be no excuse thereafter for the \nattacks.''\n  Iraq has become the proving ground of our commitment to the war on \nterror. If we waver, our enemies will read our hesitation as victory. \nIf we do not fight the terrorists abroad, we will be forced to fight \nthem on our shores.\n  We must remain united behind our troops and committed to this \nmission. I urge the Senate to continue to support the strategy \nPresident Bush outlined last night.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska. He \nhas been such a strong leader as chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee and chairman of the Defense Appropriations Committee as well. \nNo one knows better how the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan are \nperforming their duties and how this administration has stepped up to \nthe plate to make sure they have what they need to do the job. He has \nbeen to Iraq and Afghanistan. He has visited the troops, as have I, and \nhis words were very helpful in talking to the American people about \nthis subject.\n  Mr. President, as we begin this day, we are also going to have a very \nimportant amendment that will help our veterans be able to have the \nservice they need as they are coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan, as \nwell as many of the veterans of previous wars who are now in the \nVeterans' Administration system.\n  Secretary Jim Nicholson, Secretary of Veterans Affairs, came to the \nCongress just this past week and said that there has been a surge in \nthe use of veterans facilities that has caused the ability to determine \nwhat will be needed in the future to be skewed. All of the patterns of \nthe past are now not in place for use today because we have more \nveterans coming into the system. That is not a bad thing.\n  We owe the veterans the care they thought they would receive when \nthey entered the military service and which they so richly deserve. \nWhether they fought in a war or not, they were there to serve, and many \nof them did fight in wars--brutal wars. The one we are in now is a \nbrutal war. There are actually more injuries and fewer deaths in the \nkind of war that we are fighting. That means that many people are \ncoming back from Iraq and Afghanistan injured.\n  Our President has said unequivocally that we are going to take care \nof those people who have served, and we are going to treat their \ninjuries because they deserve to have that treatment. So Secretary \nNicholson has come to us and asked for an emergency appropriation. We \nare going to give Secretary Nicholson, of course, an emergency \nappropriation.\n  Senator Murray and Senator Byrd are working on an amendment. I have a \nsecond-degree amendment with Senators Santorum, Kyl, and Craig. It is a \nleadership amendment because we put it together with the White House, \nthe OMB, and the Veterans Affairs Department, to try to get the \nnumbers. We wanted to know what we will need for this year, going into \nnext year.\n  I am chairman of the Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee. I \nhave worked with Senator Craig, who is the chairman of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, which authorizes the policies that affect veterans. \nWe have put together a second-degree amendment to Senator Murray's and \nSenator Byrd's amendment that will put $1.5 billion into the system \nimmediately, and it will be there until it is spent. It will take us \ninto the next fiscal year, because we are not going to scrimp on \nserving our veterans. We need more prostheses; we need improved ability \nto help people who have lost arms or legs, or who have been burned. We \nare going to provide that help, Mr. President, and our amendment is \ngoing to be a consensus that will come together with everybody at the \ntable.\n  We are going to do the right thing by our veterans with an emergency \nappropriation that will come to the Senate floor this afternoon. It \nwill be put on the Interior appropriations bill. We worked with Senator \nBurns and his staff to put this emergency in at the first possible \nvehicle, and the first vehicle is on the Senate floor today. We just \ngot the numbers this week. That is why we are going to immediately put \nin force an emergency appropriation that will assure that our Veterans' \nAdministration has the funds it needs to treat these veterans. It also \nis going to assure that we don't take from the building funds because \nwe know there are many veterans facilities in the process of being \nbuilt or promised to be built. We need more veterans facilities, not \nfewer. So taking from maintenance accounts or capital accounts didn't \nseem like the right thing to do.\n  We worked together with the Veterans' Administration, with the \nleadership of our President, with Democrats and Republicans, to come up \nwith the right numbers to put it on the first bill that will go through \nthe Senate this week. We hope the House will work with us to fund this \nappropriation and that nothing will be, in any way, delayed or denied \nto a veteran, either one coming back from Iraq or one coming back from \nAfghanistan or from anywhere in the world, or a veteran who has served \npreviously.\n  Mr. President, I so appreciate the President's speech last night. I \nappreciate that he gave his speech at Fort Bragg, NC, in front of those \nmen and women serving our country in the most noble way. I appreciate \nthat the President said we hope more people will volunteer for the \nArmy. We need more volunteers right now. We are ramping up the end \nstrength of the Army by 30,000. This is part of our ongoing effort to \nrevamp the Army. The Army is doing a fabulous job in Iraq. So are the \nMarines. The Navy and the Air Force are helping. But we need to have \nAmerica come together.\n  I was so pleased that the President asked Americans to do something \nnext week, on July 4, Independence Day. He asked every American to \nreach out to a family of someone serving today in Iraq or Afghanistan. \nI know the people of America will respond. I know they will go to that \nWeb site and start the process of finding out how they can do more to \ngive those young men and women with boots on the ground overseas \nfighting terror the opportunity to talk to their folks back home, to \ntalk to their families.\n  The President is taking the lead, and the Senate--Republicans and \nDemocrats--must come together to lead our country to do the right thing \nin the war on terror.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we may proceed \nwith a unanimous-consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

First, mine; \nis my understanding correct?\n  Mr. BURNS. That is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And then his.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote will be on the Burns amendment first, \nfollowed by the Boxer amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The time is equally divided an hour a side to debate both \namendments; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that any quorum \ncalls when placed be divided evenly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Chair \nnotes that the Senator from Montana has not yet called up his \namendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I defer to him. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, we do not have it yet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair believes that the amendment is not \nat the desk yet.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I assure the Senator from California, I \nknow we have it somewhere, and I will find it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is reassuring.\n  Mr. BURNS. That is reassuring; isn't it? Everybody gets to read it--\nthat is different in the Senate. We have it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1068\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Burns], for himself, Mr. \n     Chambliss, and Mr. Inhofe, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1068.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency to conduct a review of all third-party intentional human dosing \n             studies to identify or quantify toxic effects)\n\n       On page 200, after line 2, add the following:\n       Sec.     . ( a) The Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency shall conduct a thorough review of all \n     third-party intentional human dosing studies to identify or \n     quantify toxic effects currently submitted to the Agency \n     under FIFRA to ensure that they:\n       (1) address a clearly defined regulatory objective;\n       (2) address a critical regulatory endpoint by enhancing the \n     Agency's scientific data bases;\n       (3) were designed and being conducted in a manner that \n     ensured the study was adequate scientifically to answer the \n     question and ensured the safety of volunteers;\n       (4) was designed to produce societal benefits that outweigh \n     any anticipated risks to participants;\n       (5) adhered to all recognized ethical standards and \n     procedures in place at the time the study was conducted; and\n       (6) are consistent with section 12(a)(2)(P) of the Federal \n     Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act and all other \n     applicable laws.\n       (b) The Administrator shall, within 60 days of the \n     enactment of this Act, report to the House and Senate \n     Committees on Appropriations; the Senate Committee on \n     Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry; and the House Committee \n     on Agriculture on the results of the review required under \n     subsection (a) and any actions taken pursuant to the review.\n       (c) Within 180 days of the enactment of this Act, the \n     Administrator shall issue a final rule that addresses \n     applying ethical standards to third party studies involving \n     intentional human dosing to identify or quantify toxic \n     effects.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe set aside and that the Senator from California be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1023\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, is it necessary to now call up amendment \nNo. 1023?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That amendment is currently pending.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think we are about to have a very \nimportant debate about a very moral subject which deals with \nintentional dosing of human beings, including children, with dangerous \npesticides. I say this is a moral issue. As a matter of fact, I believe \nI can call my amendment a faith-based amendment because every major \nreligious organization in this country supports my amendment.\n  My amendment passed the House without a single dissenting vote. It \nwas by unanimous consent. I am shocked and stunned that we even have \nopposition to this very simple amendment.\n  The amendment that was offered by my good friend, the Senator from \nMontana, in my opinion and in the opinion of people who know about \nethics and science and pesticide testing, it is actually a very \ndangerous amendment. It is offered as, I call it a CY amendment, cover \nyourself amendment. You can vote for his amendment and then against \nmine. If you look at his amendment, it is a step back to what is \nhappening currently. It is a dangerous amendment because we will push \nthrough a new regulation that already has been condemned by, as I say, \nevery major religious organization in this country.\n  We will debate this for the next couple of hours, but I wanted to \nmake a statement in reaction to the President's speech last night.\n\n\n                        President Bush's Speech\n\n  Mr. President, the President had every opportunity last night to lay \nout his plan for success in Iraq. I had given a number of interviews \nwhere I urged him to do that, and colleagues on both sides urged him to \ndo that. Instead, what we got was a defense of the status quo and \nabsolutely no mention of the need to be ready when our troops come \nback, 13,000 plus, with horrific injuries, physical and mental--an \nopportunity to say our troops will have everything they need when they \ncome home and every bit of equipment they need on the field in Iraq was \nblown last night. And then there was no plan of how we are going to get \nout of this thing, and a continuation of the myth that the war in Iraq \nhad something to do with\n9/11, which it did not.\n  I looked back yesterday at the Department of State as they looked at \nwhere al-Qaida was on September 11. Not one al-Qaida cell was in Iraq \non September 11. There were more al-Qaida cells in my home State of \nCalifornia.\n  I am very sorry to see we are on that status quo and the daily news \ncontinues with the disastrous effects of a policy that is not geared \ntoward success.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1023\n\n  Mr. President, I am now going to talk about my amendment. I see the \nSenator from Florida is here. At an appropriate moment, I will yield to \nhim. I want to lay out the general aspects of my amendment.\n  The amendment that I offer will simply say we need to take a timeout \nin terms of the environmental protections action on accepting for \nreview and, in essence, condoning pesticide testing on human beings. We \nneed a timeout. Christy Todd Whitman thought we needed a moratorium. \nShe put one in place. Carol Browner, under President Clinton, put a \nmoratorium in place. But now the moratorium has lapsed and, shockingly, \nEPA is considering and encouraging intentional dosing of human beings \nwith dangerous pesticides. This is not rhetoric. I am going to show the \ncharts and show the experiments.\n\n  What my friend and colleague is offering is a figleaf cover \namendment: Don't vote for Boxer, it actually does something; vote for \nthe Burns amendment which--listen to what it does--speeds up a \nregulation that is already going through EPA that is downright \ndangerous and involves testing of human beings, including newborn \nbabies--very ill newborn babies--pregnant women, and fetuses. That is \nwhy every major religious organization in America has entered on the \nside of the Boxer amendment and opposed to the Burns amendment.\n\n[[Page S7553]]\n\n  I am going to show the actual language of the Boxer amendment. It is \nexactly the language of the House-passed amendment:\n\n       None of the funds made available in this Act may be used by \n     the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to\n       (1) accept, consider, or rely on third-party intentional \n     dosing human studies for pesticides; or\n       (2) to conduct intentional dosing human studies for \n     pesticides.\n       It is simply a straightforward timeout so that we can look \n     at the ethical, moral, and health issues surrounding the \n     current policy at the EPA.\n\n  As I said, Carol Browner, a Democrat, put that moratorium in place; \nChristy Todd Whitman, a Republican, put that moratorium in place. But \nnow it has been allowed to lapse.\n  I recently released a staff report with Congressman Waxman that \nreviewed 22 of the studies that EPA is currently looking at. I want to \ntell you what we found after reviewing these studies.\n  We found that human testing of pesticide moratorium was allowed to \nlapse by the EPA; that over 20 human dosing studies are currently being \nreviewed by the EPA; and that the studies--and this is the most \nimportant point, Mr. President--the studies routinely violate ethical \nand scientific standards laid out in the Nuremberg Code, the \nDeclaration of Helsinki, the ``Common Rule,'' and the National Academy \nof Sciences recommendations on human testing. In other words, we have \nnothing in place that would guide these experiments.\n  I am going to show you one of these experiments that is being \nreviewed by the EPA. So let's go to the UC San Diego study.\n  I care a lot about this because this happened in my State.\n  This is a study on chloropicrin. What is chloropicrin? It is a \nfumigant. It is an active ingredient in tear gas, and it was a chemical \nwarfare agent in World War I.\n  I told you about chloropicrin. In the material safety data sheet \nwhich is put out by the manufacturer, this is what it says about \nchloropicrin which was given to UC San Diego students, and I will talk \nabout the dose they received.\n  Warning statements and warning properties, this is what it says:\n\n       Danger. May be fatal if inhaled or swallowed. Severe burn \n     follows liquid contact with eyes or skin. May cause severe \n     respiratory tract irritation. Causes eye and skin irritation. \n     Lachrymator--\n\nThis means it is the tear gas property--\n\n     poison may cause lung damage.\n\n  Chloropicrin was categorized as a category 1, which is the most toxic \ndue to acute lethality and severe irritation.\n  Let's look at how the students got these doses. They were paid $15 an \nhour. They were told that this was not dangerous. They signed liability \nwaivers. This is all unethical, and nothing in the Burns amendment will \nstop any of this and nothing in the Burns amendment addresses these \nissues.\n  Here we can see the students receiving this dangerous fumigant \nthrough this hose and breathing it in. This is right from the study:\n\n       Figure 10. Showing subjects sampling from two cones through \n     yokes that directed flow from the right cone into the right \n     nostril and from the left cone into the left nostril. The \n     subjects needed to decide whether they felt the chloropicrin \n     on the right or the left.\n\n  Do you want your daughter breathing in this dangerous chemical at \ndoses that are very large, which I will explain?\n  This is a picture of a young woman taking part in an experiment where \nthe chloropicrin dose was up to 1.2 parts per million. I want you to \nremember 1.2 parts per million because this is the point. The workplace \nsafety standard for chloropicrin is .1 parts per million. This \nexperiment dosed these kids with 12 times higher than the average level \nallowed in the workplace.\n  Let me repeat that. This experiment dosed these students with 12 \ntimes the level that is considered safe. And this is a recent \nexperiment. It ended in December of 2004.\n  I am going to show you what OSHA says you should wear when you are \nexposed to chloropicrin at levels higher than .1, 12 times lower than \nthese students were dosed with. It requires a full-face plate \nrespirator or powered air purifying respirator with organic cartridge \nto protect from the chemical, according to the manufacturer.\n  I have to say, what more of a moral issue can we be facing than \nallowing these students to have chloropicrin pumped through their \nnostrils at a rate 12 times higher than the safety level that OSHA, our \nFederal Government, says is safe? What right do we have to allow that \nto go on? Yet the Burns amendment will allow it to go on.\n  The only way to stop it is with the Boxer amendment, which is the \nidentical amendment to the House amendment where not even Tom DeLay, \nwho comes from the pesticide industry, registered a ``no'' vote.\n  How can we in the Senate, the most deliberative body in the land, \nwalk away from a simple moratorium on this kind of situation?\n  Let us look at the next chart. This next chart shows the 20 studies \nunder review since the moratorium was allowed to lapse. I could not \neven pronounce all of these properly, but I will give a few of them. \nCarbofuran, ethephon, amitraz, methomyl, oxamyl, malathion, and \nchloropicrin was the top one.\n  It also shows the dates. These are all studies similar to this one. \nActually, in one study did they not have to swallow pesticide pills for \nbreakfast? That is a fact.\n  Because I am a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nas a result of that membership we demanded to see all of these studies. \nThey were being kept from the public and we now know these things are \ngoing on.\n  In some studies subjects were harmed--for example, experiencing heart \narrhythmias; that is, an uneven heartbeat, a racing heart, and we now \nknow it was a result of that chemical that was being used. Many of the \nstudies had very misleading consent forms. Some described the pesticide \nas a drug. In some studies adverse outcomes were dismissed. They said, \noh, they went to the hospital because they did not feel good, but it \nhad nothing to do with the dosing of the pesticide. Hard to believe.\n  Most of the studies had no long-term monitoring reviews and few were \nlarge enough to be statistically valid. The deficiencies are \nsignificant and widespread and that is why we need this moratorium on \nthis timeout to allow a set of standards to be developed that governs \nthe use of these studies. The development of sound standards is \ncritical, if the problems with human pesticide testing are to be \naddressed.\n  At this point, I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am delighted to join my \ncolleague from California. We have fought these battles before. We \nfought one of these battles when unbelievably the EPA wanted to conduct \nan experiment. They called it a study. It was a 2-year study they were \ngoing to perform on infants in my State in Jacksonville, FL. This 2-\nyear study was going to expose those infants to pesticides. It was \ngoing to be done with the inducement by getting the parents of the \ninfants to sign a contract of which over a 2-year period they were \ngoing to be paid $970, were going to be given a T-shirt, were going to \nbe given other kinds of trinkets, and a certificate of appreciation in \nreturn for children over that 2-year period being exposed to pesticides \nthat were going to be placed in the home.\n  Oh, by the way, guess which part of town this was going to occur in. \nYou guessed it. It was going to occur in the lower income and minority \nsections of Jacksonville.\n  Senator Boxer and I got wind of it. Well, she got wind of it because \nshe was sitting on the committee having to do with the confirmation of \nthe head of EPA and she announced that, in fact, she was not going to \nlet the EPA nominee go through. Then she came to me and pointed out \nthat, in fact, this was occurring in Florida.\n  This was one of the brochures, if my colleagues can believe it, that \nEPA was going to send out. As a matter of fact, they had already sent \nit out in Jacksonville. They had gotten some 30 parents to already sign \nup for this program. It states: You're a parent. Learn more about your \nchild's potential pesticide exposure. Am I eligible to participate? \nOnly 60 participants will be selected. To be selected, you must be a \nparent of a child less than 3 months old or one between the ages of 9 \nand 12 months old.\n\n[[Page S7554]]\n\n  Get this, in order to be eligible, one has to spray or have \npesticides sprayed inside their home routinely.\n  The ad states: Will I be compensated? Oh, of course. You will receive \nup to $970 over the 2-year period. Your family will receive an official \nframed certificate of appreciation, a CHEERS bib for your baby, a T-\nshirt, a calendar, and a study newsletter. You will be allowed to keep \nthe video camcorder they are going to give to you to record this study \nover the 2 years. You will be allowed to keep the video camcorder at \nthe end of the study provided you have completed all of the study \nactivities.\n  Can anyone believe this is going on in the United States of America \nin the year 2005?\n  Well, we put a stop to it because Senator Boxer put a hold on the \nnominee. I put a hold on the nominee. I had a conversation with the \nnominee and I told the nominee I had no objection to the nominee. As a \nmatter of fact, I had heard awfully good things about the nominee. But \nas a Senator from Florida, I certainly was not going to let that sort \nof thing go on in my State and it should not be going on in any State. \nAll I wanted the nominee to do was to cancel that study.\n\n  What they did not tell the local Jacksonville Health Department was \nthat of the $9 million the study was going to cost, $2 million of the \n$9 million was being supplied by the pesticide industry. Needless to \nsay, the Duval County Health Department did not like it when they found \nthat out.\n  This is the kind of stuff we have had to go through with regard to \nhuman testing and it just should not be. So it is time to put it in \nthis bill. This is unlike pharmaceutical studies on humans that offer \nthe possibility that a human subject may benefit from the experiment. \nThe human testing of pesticides offers no therapeutic benefit, and \nunder this proposed rule EPA would be allowed to test on humans, \nchildren, pregnant women, newborns, and infants.\n  This senior Senator from Florida has had a bellyful of this kind of \nstuff to come in on the citizens of the State of Florida, and I want it \nstopped. Any exposure of an infant child or a pregnant woman to a toxin \nbasically should be prohibited, even in doses that are not expected to \ndo any harm.\n  With the experience I have had in Jacksonville, it was simply \nirresponsible for the EPA, whose very mission is to protect human \nhealth and the environment, to have proposed such a study. The last \ntime I checked, I thought EPA stood for Environmental Protection \nAgency. Well, then it needs to fulfill its challenge. It needs to \nfulfill the goal of its name.\n  The happy ending to the story in Jacksonville was that we stopped it \nbecause the nominee for the head of the EPA cancelled the study. \nSenator Boxer and I lifted our hold and we send our great wishes to the \nnew administrator of the EPA for a successful administration.\n  We need to help the administrator of EPA have a successful \nadministration and we can do this with the Boxer-Nelson amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Would the Senator please yield back his extra time to me?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I certainly will.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator from Florida. He is a protector of \nchildren, families, and the vulnerable of his State. His help on that \nCHEERS program and getting that stopped was an enormous contribution. \nMany times we do big things around here that deal with huge issues and \nwe do not know the impact of our work for a long time. When one works \nfor clean air, clean water, it takes a while.\n  I say to my friend from Florida, this is something he can be proud of \nbecause we together, as a team, with the help of some of our colleagues \non the Environment and Public Works Committee, were able to use the \nleverage each Senator has to force a cancellation of a program that was \nintentionally dosing little children with pesticides, paying off their \nparents who tended to be poor, giving the parents a video camera, and \nsubjecting these children to dangerous chemicals. So I think we have to \nbe proud that we saved some kids from this.\n  I want to say why my amendment is so crucial and why the Burns \namendment is so bad if one cares about protecting children and \nfamilies. The amendment I have offered with my colleague from Florida--\nand, by the way, I ask unanimous consent that the following Senators be \nadded as cosponsors to this amendment: Senators Snowe, Collins, Nelson \nof Florida, Clinton, Schumer, Obama, Jeffords, Kerry, Lautenberg, Reid, \nand Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I think my colleagues can see this is a bipartisan \namendment. We want to protect our children. This has nothing to do with \npolitics. We want to protect our families.\n  Here is what is happening. The Burns substitute, which he is going to \ntry to tell everyone is better than the moratorium, essentially \nencourages the EPA to continue with their rulemaking. It says, go on, \nhurry, finish it up, and it does nothing to stop any of the testing \nthat is going on right now. So it is a step back. It is a dangerous \nstep back.\n  Now, why do I say that? I will tell my colleagues about the EPA rule \nthat is coming at us if we do not stop this. This is straight from the \nEPA. We are fortunate enough to have this information today.\n\n       The Agency has decided not to include any proposed \n     requirements relating to a Human Studies Review Board as \n     suggested in the National Academy of Sciences recommendation \n     6-2.\n\n  The National Academy of Sciences--we looked for it so that we have \nethical guidelines. The EPA has rejected the guidelines of the National \nAcademy of Sciences and the Burns amendment says, oh, go right ahead, \nEPA, finish your regulations, and the Burns amendment makes no \nreference to the NAS. This is more from the EPA:\n\n       The promulgation of rules prescribing such details \n     [establishment of the Human Studies Review Board] would \n     unnecessarily confine EPA's discretion . . .\n\n  So, in other words, they are admitting they are turning away the \nguidelines of the National Academy of Sciences because they do not want \nto be confined in doing what they do.\n  What do they want to do? When you find that out you will be rather \nshocked. Are you ready for this? I say to my friend from Montana, if \nthis doesn't shake his confidence in his amendment, nothing will. This \nis a bombshell that I am about to tell you.\n  The EPA is considering continuing a limited number of scientific \nstudies involving pregnant women--meaning they will be dosed with \npesticides, fetuses--meaning fetuses will be dosed with pesticides, \nneonates of uncertain viability--and just for those of you who do not \nknow, neonates are newborn babies--of uncertain viability--meaning they \nare ill; sick babies will be in these experiments, or nonviable \nneonates--meaning newborns who may not make it. They are going to dose \nthem as well.\n  If we can't take a stand to protect the sickest of the newborn \nbabies, then we don't deserve to be here. If we are going to stand with \nthe pesticide companies against ill, very ill newborn babies, what are \nwe doing here? We don't belong here.\n  Let's see what some of the religious groups are saying. For those \npeople who want to have faith-based legislation, you are on the faith-\nbased legislation when you support the Boxer-Snowe-Nelson-Clinton-\nCollins, et cetera amendment. This is the statement of the Leadership \nof Diverse Faith Groups on human testing. It is signed by the National \nCouncil of Churches and the Coalition on the Environment and Jewish \nLife.\n\n       Our faiths teach us to protect the vulnerable among us and \n     to do so we need a moratorium on the use of human testing \n     data in the registration of pesticides, not another study or \n     report.\n\n  The Burns alternative is another study. But worse than that, the \nBurns amendment encourages and orders the EPA to get their regulations \nin place, regulations that, as I told you, allow testing on newborn \nbabies and fetuses and pregnant women and desperately ill newborns. Why \nare we having a debate? Why aren't we all supporting a moratorium, a \ntimeout, just as Christie Todd Whitman did, just as Carol Browner did? \nThis is a bipartisan effort.\n  Unfortunately, we have to choose. Instead of walking down this aisle \ntogether and saying we will not allow testing on pregnant women--can \nyou imagine testing pesticides on desperately ill newborn babies and \ntesting\n\n[[Page S7555]]\n\npesticides on fetuses? I just can't imagine that that is what we are \ngoing to do today by voting on the Burns amendment and telling EPA to \nhurry up with their regulations instead of taking a timeout.\n  Let's look at some of the churches that are involved in supporting \nthe Boxer amendment. Let's take a look at the list of these churches \nand these religious organizations. I will just read some of them: The \nAfrican Methodist Episcopal Church; the Alliance of Baptists; \nArchdiocese of America; the Diocese of the Armenian Church; Christian \nChurch (Disciple of Christ); the Church of the Brethren; the Coptic \nChurch; the Evangelical Lutheran Church; Friends United Meeting; Greek \nOrthodox Archdiocese of America; International Council of Community \nChurches; Korean Presbyterian Church; Moravian Church in America, \nNorthern Province and Southern Province; National Baptist Convention of \nAmerica; National Baptist Convention, USA; Orthodox Church in America; \nPolish National Catholic Church of America; Progressive National \nBaptist Convention; Syrian Orthodox Church of Antioch; Ukrainian \nOrthodox Church of the United States of America; United Church of \nChrist; The United Methodist Church.\n  It goes on.\n  The reason I am reading this is this is very unusual to see a faith-\nbased amendment that deals with morality, to have so many of our \nreligious leaders supporting us and opposing the Burns amendment. Why \ndo we even have a debate? Certain things are right and certain things \nare wrong. Yes, it is an issue of social justice. Who is going to step \nup to the plate and offer up their newborn baby?\n  Let's take a look at that again, the statement about testing on \nnewborns. I think Senator Durbin is interested in this and said he \nwanted to ask a question about it. The fact is, all of the religious \norganizations have stepped up to the plate, in part, because of this. \nThis is EPA's own words.\n\n       EPA thinks it likely that it will continue a limited number \n     of scientific studies involving pregnant women, fetuses, \n     neonates [meaning newborns] of uncertain viability, or non-\n     viable neonates [in other words, desperately ill babies] in \n     the future.\n\n  It is hard to imagine how anyone in the Senate could vote for an \nalternative which encourages the EPA to hurry up and produce their \nregulation, when we can all come together as everyone did in the House \nof Representatives and say: Time out, EPA. This is a moral issue.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from California yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I direct the question through the Chair. Those tuning in \nto this debate and starting to listen may not grasp what is at issue. \nThe way you described it to us yesterday in the Senate Democratic \ncaucus luncheon was that the Environmental Protection Agency is testing \nthe toxicity, or poisonous nature, of pesticides on human beings here \nin the United States. Since this came to the attention of the House of \nRepresentatives, they have said this is wrong; we don't want to \nendanger anyone's life by testing them with pesticides, particularly \nchildren, pregnant women, others--for that matter, any person. So they \ndecided to suspend, as I understand it, the authority of the EPA to go \nforward with this testing.\n  An argument is being made on the floor today, by those opposing your \namendment, that we should go ahead and continue the testing? Is that \nwhat is at issue?\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is the essence. You can put lipstick on it but \nessentially the opposition is saying no to the Boxer amendment, and \nlet's just tell the EPA to look at ethical guidelines and consider them \nand hurry up and issue a regulation.\n  Does it make any reference to the National Academy of Sciences, which \nhas very strict regulations? It doesn't make any reference to any of \nthe guidelines that are internationally recognized. So, in essence, the \nBurns amendment is the status quo with a kicker that we continue these \nstudies and that, in essence, we say to the EPA: Hurry up with your \nregulation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will further yield for a question through \nthe Chair, the photograph she displayed is the same one she brought \nbefore us yesterday. It depicts two young people, a man and woman, who \nare involved in some testing where they are inhaling pesticides to \ndetermine what the physical impact would be if they have a certain \namount of pesticide in their system. Are you saying the Federal \nGovernment is paying for this research, and is paying these people to \ncome forward and submit to this testing?\n  Mrs. BOXER. This test is being paid for by the pesticide maker, who \nwants to say that they should be allowed to use more chloropicrin in \ntheir pesticide. They have paid the University of San Diego to do this.\n  The EPA accepted that study. In other words, they are saying fine, we \nare going to look at the results of that study.\n  It was Ronald Reagan who put a stop to looking at the tests that came \nout of World War II. Because after World War II, we saw what was going \non with medical studies. Ronald Reagan was the one who said we are \ngoing to stop this. We are not going to even look at these studies \nbecause they are immoral.\n  What we are saying today is, it is immoral to take a young woman like \nthis--and tell her, by the way, she is not going to be harmed--make her \nsign a waiver of liability so she cannot really recover if she is sick, \npay her $15 an hour because she is a student and probably needs the \nmoney desperately, and not tell her what this other picture shows, the \nman in the mask, that she is breathing chloropicrin at a rate 12 times \nthe rate that our Federal Government, our OSHA says is dangerous.\n  If you were to have a concentration of this chemical 12 times less \nthan what these kids are getting into their nostrils, into their lungs, \nyou need to wear this type of full-face plate respirator or powered air \npurifying respirator with organic cartridge to protect from the \nchemicals.\n  Mr. DURBIN. How long has this been going on?\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is the interesting question. Under Bill Clinton's \nadministration, in the late 1990s, Carol Browner, the Administrator of \nEPA, stopped this kind of acceptance of these tests by the EPA.\n  Christie Todd Whitman agreed with her and stopped all of this and \nsaid EPA is not going to look at these. It is immoral. It is wrong.\n  It is only recently that this moratorium was allowed to lapse and the \ncurrent Administrator--it is Leavitt, I think--started to accept these \nstudies. So it is very recent.\n  Remember, we had two EPA Administrators who had said no to this. Now, \nsuddenly we are back in the game of utilizing these studies and sending \na signal out to the scientific world: Go ahead and do these dosing \nstudies.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will further yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. We have people stationed at the borders between the \nUnited States and Mexico who are testing fruits and vegetables that \ncome into our country. The Food and Drug Administration does this. The \nU.S. Department of Agriculture is involved in this testing to determine \nwhether there is pesticide residue on apples and tomatoes, vegetables \nand fruits that come in. And if there is just the slightest residue of \ncertain pesticides, we confiscate the shipment, stop the shipment from \ncoming into the United States for fear that just the slightest residue \nof the pesticide or the fruits and vegetables may be a danger to public \nhealth in America.\n\n  That is why it is so difficult for many of us who listen to this \ndebate to understand that at the same time another agency of our \nGovernment, with the cooperation of a special interest group, the \npesticide industry, is actually testing concentrations of these same \npesticides on innocent people in America.\n  I think the Senator has gone on to say it is not just college \nstudents standing and being paid $15. The testing reaches a level where \nthey are testing on fetuses and on neonates of uncertain viability?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. Let me take back my time because the Senator from \nNew York is on schedule. I want to make sure she has time to speak. But \nlet me tell you this. The EPA's own words are that, in fact, they will \nconsider testing on these neonates and the rest.\n  Yes. This is immoral. I would like to tell you, the U.S. Conference \nof Catholic Bishops, on their Web site, in 2005, say this:\n\n\n[[Page S7556]]\n\n\n       We are very concerned about using humans for the direct \n     testing of pesticides under any conditions, particularly when \n     they will not receive any direct or immediate health benefit \n     but in fact may be harmed.\n\n  So we are not here testing pharmaceutical products that may help a \nbaby. We are here looking at harming a baby, harming a pregnant woman.\n  So the Boxer moratorium vote is very important.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator has 18 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will yield 8 minutes to my colleague from New York, \nwith an additional 2 minutes should she require it.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise in strong, overwhelming support \nfor the Boxer amendment. I agree with my friend and colleague from \nCalifornia that there should not be a single vote against this \namendment. As was done in the House, this amendment should pass \nunanimously, and I hope at the end of this debate, led by the able \nSenator from California, that will be the conclusion of all of our \ncolleagues, on both sides of the aisle.\n  This debate is not about whether pesticides can be useful. Pesticide \nuse has improved crop yields, has helped to control insect and other \npests. We can all agree on that.\n  I am sympathetic to the farmers that raised with me the concern they \nhave about how our current system works for testing pesticides. The \nfact is, we ask our domestic farmers to comply with detailed pesticide \nrequirements. We have no similar controls on overseas farmers. That is \nnot fair. It does not keep our food as safe as it should be. That \nshould be addressed at a later time.\n  Let's put that aside. What we are talking about is pesticide testing. \nPesticides are inherently toxic. They have been linked to a broad range \nof human health problems, including cancer, damage to the central \nnervous system, interference with neural development, and the endocrine \nsystem. Children are particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of \npesticides.\n  This debate is about ensuring we protect our children and ourselves \nfrom the adverse effects of pesticides that could be administered \nthrough these testing programs. We need to ensure that any studies that \nCongress sanctions are conducted in a safe and ethical manner.\n  The reason we are debating this, as amazing as it is to many who \nmight be watching, the administration is taking actions that undermine \nthe protection we should be able to count on against misuse of \npesticides and pursuing a path that leads to using testing regimens \nwhich are ill thought out, poorly conceived, and immoral.\n  At the urging of the pesticide industry, the EPA has reversed a \nmoratorium on the consideration of studies in which humans are \nintentionally dosed with pesticides. In addition, the administration \nwill soon propose a regulation that will greatly expand the funding and \nuse of such studies.\n  This amendment, which I am proud to cosponsor, simply says we need to \nstop and take a much closer look at this issue before we continue down \nthis dangerous path. At the present time, the EPA is reviewing more \nthan 20 human pesticide studies. Many of them violate widely accepted \nethical standards for research involving human subjects.\n  Specifically, there were instances where those who conducted the \nstudies failed to obtain informed consent, inflicted harm on the human \nsubjects, dismissed adverse outcomes or failed to conduct long-term \nmonitoring.\n  That is not just my opinion. That is the conclusion of the National \nAcademy of Sciences, in a report issued in 2004, which found that the \nEPA pesticide studies were in gross violation of ethical standards set \nout in the Nuremberg Code, the Declaration of Helsinki, and the common \nrule that guides medical research in our country.\n  In addition, the NAS concluded that pesticide manufacturers have \nsubmitted to EPA intentional oral dosing studies involving humans in \norder to justify the reduction or elimination of safety factors for the \nregulation of certain pesticides in food residues.\n  To begin with, it is clear the EPA should not be using these flawed \nstudies in any way. That is one part of what our amendment would do: \nProhibit the EPA from using or relying on third-party human pesticide \nstudies. The amendment would also prohibit the EPA from funding such \nstudies.\n  The reason it is so important is in plain view in yesterday's news \nreport. According to them, the EPA is on the verge of issuing draft \nregulations that open the floodgate for new EPA, Government-sponsored \nstudies involving human pesticide testing. These draft regulations are \nin direct contradiction to the key recommendations made by the National \nAcademy of Sciences. For example, as my colleague from California has \npointed out, the draft rule reportedly legitimizes pesticide testing on \nchildren, pregnant women, and newborns. It ignores recommendations for \nthe establishment of an independent ethics review board to evaluate \nproposed studies on a case-by-case basis.\n  I don't see how any Member cannot be concerned about this regulation. \nWe are going to be monitoring it very closely. It is clear that in \naddition to preventing the EPA from looking at human studies, we need \nto prohibit the EPA from conducting and sanctioning human studies.\n  I point out that this issue goes much further than even what we are \ndiscussing in the Senate. It has broad implications for how we protect \nour children. Pesticide manufacturers want to push for human testing \nbecause it may result in less stringent exposure standards. That \nconcerns me. The Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 tightened the \nregulation of pesticide residues in food and specifically added more \nstringent safety factors to account for the increased sensitivity of \ninfants and children. It also includes safety factors that apply to \nanimal tests but not to human tests.\n  The EPA is clearly headed in the wrong direction. We should work \ndiligently to make sure we pass the Boxer amendment. It is so important \nto take a stand on this. We do not need another study. We know the EPA \nhas studied. They have looked at the National Academy of Sciences' \nrecommendations. It is clear we need to pass this immediately to send a \nsignal, joining with the House which passed such a prohibition, a \nmoratorium by unanimous consent, that this cannot go forward.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the second-degree amendment, to pass \nthe Boxer amendment, and to take a stand against this kind of reckless, \nimmoral testing and sanctioning of testing on children, on infants, and \non all human subjects.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding me that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before the Senator leaves, I thank the \nSenator from New York who has always been such a credible voice for our \nchildren and our families and for their health and well-being.\n  As she said, this should be what the younger generations calls a ``no \nbrainer.'' We need a timeout. We do not need to have the Burns \namendment passed, which will speed up the EPA regulation which allows \nthe testing of pesticides on newborn babies who are ill. It \nspecifically says ``ill newborn babies or near-death newborn babies.'' \nIf we stand for something, we should stand with all the religious \norganizations in this country that support the Boxer amendment and \noppose the Burns amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to be able to reserve the balance of my time \nuntil the conclusion of Senator Burns's remarks and that the quorum \ncall not be counted against my side.\n  If I could explain to the Senator from Alaska, I only have about 5 \nminutes remaining, and I want to retain that time for when Senator \nBurns concludes. He knows this. I don't think he has a problem with it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield the floor, retain my remaining 9 minutes, and \nwait for the conclusion of the debate.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, we better open up this morning and \ncharacterize what the Burns-Chambliss-Inhofe amendment does compared to \nwhat is being advocated by my friend from California.\n  Our amendment directs the administrator of EPA to conduct a thorough\n\n[[Page S7557]]\n\nreview of all third-party intentional human dosage studies based on six \nprinciples listed at the National Academy of Sciences in their February \n2004 report. The National Academy report found that, in certain cases, \nthe societal benefits of such studies outweigh the risks.\n  This amendment also directs the administrator to issue a final rule \nthat addresses applying ethical standards to third-party studies \ninvolving intentional human dosing to identify or quantify toxic \neffects within 180 days of enactment of this act. In other words, they \nhave an open end now where they drag their feet as far as offering \nreports to Congress.\n  By the way, I ask unanimous consent Senator Brownback of Kansas be \nadded as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, we know we can use very emotional examples \nto draw our attention to this issue. My first thought, I don't think \nthere is a chemical engineer or a scientist in this Senate. I can't say \nthat for sure, without having a degree in chemical engineering. \nNonetheless, we have to rely on reports. We also have to rely on \nreports that are peer reviewed from many different sources.\n  What the Senator from California has brought to the Senate this \nmorning has a few flaws. First of all, they are quoting from a staff \ndraft of a study, and we do not know what the outcome will be. We do \nnot know what the final rule will look like. The administrator has not \neven seen it, let alone made any recommendations to be agreed to. That \nis No. 1.\n  Basically, the Senator's amendment prohibits the EPA from conducting \nor accepting research involving intentional dosing of human subjects. \nShe referred to the CHEERS study. What is the CHEERS study? In the \nCHEERS study, the agency proposed to monitor children's exposure to \npesticide in a specific population. That is what it is was for. The \nproposed CHEERS study, developed by the Office of Research and \nDevelopment at EPA, was an observational and biomonitoring study and \nnot a dosing study. As a result, her amendment does not impact CHEERS \nor any other similar type of study. I want that in the Record. We \nshould be very clear about that.\n  We are not chemists or chemical engineers. We are not scientists. All \nof the warnings and all of the charts we have seen this morning are a \nresult of studies, be they EPA, through peer review or third-party \nstudies with peer review. We would not know this information had there \nnot been studies, third party or by the EPA. Her amendment is very \nclear. It just says we stop testing.\n\n  So I ask my colleagues, on this issue: How do we know? How can we \nfind out? Because we need this information. Do we allow chemists or \nchemical engineers to do this, with no backup, working for a private \ncorporation in the business of selling pesticides, fumigants, \nherbicides, detergents, car washes, carpets, the padding on our chairs? \nEverything we touch or we live with has a so-called chemical element to \nit. Do we just take their word for it, those who are in the business of \nselling these products? Unless there are third-party studies, with peer \nreview and EPA studies with the same standards of peer review, that \nwould be the case.\n  This is not like the testing of prescription drugs. Having no test on \nchemicals, no information on chemicals that we use in the production of \nfood and fiber and shelter in this country is not a very good idea. It \nis not a good idea. As I said, would we know about the warnings that \nwere used today had it not been for testing?\n  Senator Boxer's amendment is so far reaching that between 60 and 70 \nchemicals and 1,300 tolerances, or the allowable pesticide residue on \nfoods, would be affected. It would mean taking those reports, putting \nthem away, and never referring to them again. That does not make a lot \nof sense. Not only is there the time, money, and effort involved, but \nalso some of the results we know of today we would not have known this \nmorning in order to make this debate.\n  For example, I have a letter from the American Mosquito Control \nAssociation, which opposes this amendment offered by my good friend \nfrom California. By the way, they support our amendment. I am going to \noffer this letter in its entirety for the Record, but I want to read \none little paragraph that I think speaks to the essence of this debate. \nI quote:\n\n       The emergence and spread of West Nile Virus in the United \n     States has re-emphasized the need for safe and effective \n     mosquito control strategies that reduce the risk of acquiring \n     this devastating disease. Personal protective measures such \n     as repellents figure prominently in these strategies--as do \n     federally-registered public health pesticides, when \n     indicated. This amendment, as written, will effectively cease \n     future research on alternatives to DEET and curtail sound, \n     ethical studies on the toxicology of public health \n     pesticides. The AMCA considers the availability of \n     scientifically sound and ethically-obtained toxicology data \n     to be essential in determining levels of risk from both \n     disease and the means used to control it.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 American Mosquito\n\n\n                                          Control Association,\n\n                               North Brunswick, NJ, June 24, 2005.\n       Dear Senator: I am writing on behalf of the membership of \n     the American Mosquito Control Association (AMCA) to express \n     our deep concern over the amendment Senator Barbara Boxer (D-\n     CA) recently introduced to the Department of the Interior, \n     Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2006. \n     As currently written, the amendment would prohibit research \n     studies having a profound effect on establishing safety and \n     toxicity profiles for a number of public health insect \n     repellents, which are listed as pesticides, In addition, it \n     would preclude the use of sound, ethically-derived data in \n     the registration of several pesticides utilized in protecting \n     public health. These studies are critical in evaluating \n     exposure levels and risk assessment. Without them, \n     extrapolations of risk could be unreliable, placing the \n     public at undue risk.\n       The sole testing procedure currently accepted by the U.S. \n     EPA (See: Product Performance Test Guidelines OPPTS \n     Sec. 810.3700. Insect Repellents for Human Skin and Outdoor \n     Premises, Public Draft. United States Environmental \n     Protection Agency. EPA 712-C-99-369, December 1999 requires \n     repellents be applied to humans to demonstrate efficacy. \n     Furthermore, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), in a \n     report entitled, Intentional Human Dosing Studies for EPA \n     Regulatory Purposes: Scientific and Ethical Issues published \n     in February 2004 stated that such studies ``contribute \n     significant and useful knowledge for regulatory standard \n     setting and other forms of public protection,'' Indeed, the \n     NAS stated, ``[i]n some cases, intentional dosing of humans \n     may be the only way to obtain data needed to set regulatory \n     standards and protect public health''.\n       The emergence and spread of West Nile Virus in the United \n     States has re-emphasized the need for safe and effective \n     mosquito control strategies that reduce the risk of acquiring \n     this devastating disease. Personal protective measures such \n     as repellents figure prominently in these strategies--as do \n     federally-registered public health pesticides, when \n     indicated. This amendment, as written, will effectively cease \n     future research on alternatives to DEET and curtail sound, \n     ethical studies on the toxicology of public health \n     pesticides. The AMCA considers the availability of \n     scientifically sound and ethically-obtained toxicology data \n     to be essential in determining levels of risk from both \n     disease and the means used to control it.\n       Furthermore, members of the United States Armed Forces rely \n     extensively upon repellents and public health pesticides to \n     reduce risk to the various exotic vector-borne diseases to \n     which they are regularly exposed. Development of new \n     repellents is urgently needed to obviate the need for \n     broadcast pesticides to provide protection both here and \n     abroad. To the extent that repellent use is curtailed because \n     of acceptability issues, pesticide applications will have to \n     be increased to afford the same level of protection.\n       Any reduction of human/mosquito contact commensurately \n     reduces the risk of disease transmission. Newer, more \n     acceptable and effective mosquito repellents would both \n     protect humans while reducing environmental pesticide load. \n     Research on these critical control adjuncts requires human \n     subjects in order to assess their efficacy and safety. \n     Establishment of safety exposure parameters to these and \n     other chemicals that might contact human skin during their \n     approved application can only be reliably obtained through \n     research fully vetted through rigorous institutional review \n     boards specifically organized for those purposes. These are \n     already in place and are fully compliant with current laws \n     and regulations.\n       Protection of the health of the American public and the \n     environment is a core value of the AMCA. The provisions of \n     this amendment in a very real way conflict with this \n     important value. Indeed, the amendment neither promotes \n     public health and safety nor provides greater protection for \n     your constituents in any foreseeable tangible manner. \n     Therefore, the American Mosquito Control Association strongly \n     urges you to oppose the Boxer Amendment when the Senate \n     considers the FY06 Interior Appropriations bill in the near \n     future. Thank you for your\n\n[[Page S7558]]\n\n     consideration and attention to this critical matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Joseph M. Conlon,\n         Technical Advisor, American Mosquito Control Association.\n  Mr. BURNS. Studies of this kind on safety must move forward or we \nwill have a public health situation being created by the unintended \nconsequence of not performing those studies.\n  Now, if I have not convinced you to vote with me yet, I also have an \nextensive list of pesticides that rely on human studies to determine \nsafe exposure levels for more than 50 crops grown in our States. In \nfact, these pesticides, cited by Senator Boxer's and Representative \nWaxman's June 25 study, have critical uses in 39 States. A few of these \nStates include: Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, \nLouisiana, Maine, Nebraska, Ohio, and West Virginia. I say to the \nPresiding Officer, I am sorry, they did not mention South Carolina. But \nthese pesticides, for every State listed, are used in the production of \nfood and fiber for this country.\n  Now, I realize there are a lot of folks who do not really understand \nagriculture maybe that much, but you have to understand the second \nthing we do in this country every day--after we get up--is eat. For the \nfirst thing we do, we have a lot of options. But the second thing we do \nis eat.\n  The largest industry probably contributing to the GDP of California \nis agriculture. If it is not the largest industry, I would be \nsurprised. Think about your brussel sprouts, strawberries, apples, dry \nbeans. Look at all your almond production, beats, peppers, celery, \ncauliflower, pistachios. The list goes on and on of these chemicals, \nthese pesticides, these fumigants, these herbicides, all used in the \nproduction of food and fiber for this country. It is pretty amazing.\n  Senator Chambliss and I are offering a reasonable alternative from \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from California. Our amendment is \nplum simple. It directs the Administrator of the EPA to ``conduct a \nthorough review of all third-party intentional''--``intentional''--\n``human dosing studies'' based on the National Academy of Sciences \nFebruary 2004 report.\n  I think it is found in this book offered as a guideline. I will give \nyou the headings: ``The Four-Step Process of Human Health Risk \nAssessment.'' Step one: ``Hazard Identification,'' ``Dose Response \nAssessment,'' ``Exposure Assessment,'' and ``Risk Characterization.'' \nThat is the guideline. Pretty simple--a little book. Anyone can order \nit. Send me your check and $5 for handling for mail, and I will get it \nout to you. But that is what it says.\n  We are directing the EPA to ``issue a final rule that addresses \napplying ethical standards to third-party studies involving intentional \nhuman dosing'' ``within 180 days of the enactment of this Act.''\n  We are putting them on a time line. We want to know. The public has a \nright to know. Everyone involved wants to know. People who work on \nallergies, many things that are normal in our everyday lives, want to \nknow: Quit dragging your feet. Let's have it. Let's get the report \nbecause we think it is pretty important.\n  There are ethical standards established. They are already in place. \nLet's get the final rule. That is what we are telling this Director. \nThat is what we are telling this agency--that we want to know--because \nas policymakers, we do not want to get caught in this idea of an \nunintentional consequence.\n  None of these warnings that we have on the label of our shirt or on \nour detergent when we wash our dishes at night--none of those warnings \nwould be there had there not been extensive work in risk assessment and \npublic health at heart if those tests had not been carried out.\n  Since that standard is set, what we are saying now is not to proceed \njust blindly down a path using no guidelines, but to write the rule \nthat allows policymakers to move forward with adopting the public's \nattitude toward this issue.\n  And we can make a mistake. We usually base all our decisions on \nhistory. As to the history of this, we study this without going blindly \noff a cliff. We usually use history. If we monkey with it, if we take \npart of it out, and that is not available to us either, or to the EPA, \nor anybody else who is making a decision as to the reliability or the \nsafety of that particular product, then we have done an injustice to \nthe people who make the decisions. That seems pretty logical to this \nnonscientist, nonchemist from the State of Montana.\n  Let's take the emotion out of it, and let's look at things as they \nreally are in the world around us. We do not touch anything, folks--we \ndo not leave the garage, we do not even get up in the morning, we do \nnot do anything in this environment around us where there are no \nchemicals. Some of them are even added by man. But we live in that kind \nof a world, with our relationship even with the Sun, the soil, and the \nwater. We live in a chemically reactive world. The more we know about \nit, the more we know about our own environment and those steps we have \nto take in order to protect it.\n  So what I and my colleagues are proposing in this Burns amendment is \nthat we proceed with standards and direct the EPA to make their rule \nfinal and publish it in the Federal record for all to see--and all to \neither uphold or criticize. That is all we are doing. It is pretty \nstraightforward. But we cannot just say: Stop, stop the clock. We \ncannot do that. That is not fair to the American people. It is not fair \nto the American consumer, and it is not fair to the folks who are \ninvolved in producing food, fiber, and shelter for this country.\n  If you want more of your food to come from offshore, where there are \nno tests, there is no way to regulate, then you just stop the process \nbecause that is where it will be coming from, even with our tremendous \nability to produce for a society that we think is probably the \nhealthiest in the world.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \namendment offered by Senator Boxer regarding the testing of pesticides \non humans. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  Unbeknownst to most of us, the Bush administration has quietly \nrescinded a ban on the human testing of pesticides even though the EPA \nis still developing guidelines for such testing. Instead of needlessly \nexposing people to dangerous pesticides, the 1-year moratorium proposed \nin this amendment is a reasonable solution until these guidelines are \ncompleted.\n  Let us be clear. We are not talking about the testing of life-saving \nmedications. By definition, pesticides are designed to kill. They are \npotential carcinogens and neurotoxins. We need guidelines to ensure \nthat human testing of these dangerous chemicals is limited and \nmonitored and that the subjects fully understand the risks they are \ntaking.\n  Who are the people being exposed to these chemicals? Typically they \nare young, poor and minorities. Let me give you two examples:\n  In Florida, an EPA study offered low-income families $970 over 2 \nyears if they let their babies be tested after their homes were sprayed \nwith pesticides. One can easily imagine a young mother trying to make \nends meet, trying to pay the rent and put food on the table, reading \nthat she can collect almost $1,000 if she allows her child to be \ntested.\n  In another study last year, 127 young adults, mostly Asian and Latino \ncollege students, agreed to be exposed to a suspected neurotoxicant for \n$15 an hour. Some were exposed in a chamber for 1 hour for 4 \nconsecutive days, while others had the chemical shot into their eyes \nand nostrils at amounts 12 times the OSHA recommended levels. This \nchemical, chloropicrin, has a history: It was used as a chemical \nwarfare agent in World War I. Yet the consent form for the 2004 study \ndid not disclose that fact; it simply said, ``We expect the discomfort \nto be short-lived.''\n  All across America, there are college students working long hours so \nthey can stay in school and get a shot at the American dream. How \ntempting it must be to pick up a handful of cash for letting a \nscientist expose you to some chemical. You are healthy, you need the \ncash, and you are probably not as wise as your parents would like you \nto be, so you borrow a chance against your future health and sign up \nfor exposure. That is not the kind of government policy we want to be \nencouraging.\n  All told, the EPA is considering data from 24 studies that tested \npesticides\n\n[[Page S7559]]\n\non humans. Many of these studies are flawed, so the risks these people \nundertook did not even contribute to a scientifically valid experiment. \nMany of these studies failed to take the health complaints of the \nsubjects seriously, many failed to disclose the risk to the subjects, \nand many failed to conduct long-term monitoring of the health effects \nof the pesticides. All of these deficiencies should be addressed and \nprevented from occurring again.\n  Sadly, we do not need to do this human testing. For years, the EPA \nhas worked with pesticide manufacturers and members of the science \ncommunity without relying on human testing. For years, the agency has \naccomplished its goals through animal testing.\n  No one doubts that actual human health data, if properly collected \nfrom a sufficient sample size, would be advantageous to know. But \nsensible guidelines are needed to ensure that the benefits of any study \nfar outweigh the potential risks to the study participants.\n  The commonsense approach is to temporarily stop this testing, wait \nfor EPA to issue its guidelines, and safeguard the health of the human \nsubjects.\n  I thank the Senator from California for her commitment to this issue, \nand I yield the floor.\n  I reserve the balance of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield myself 7 minutes and retain 2 \nminutes, if I may.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 7 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Senator from Montana has, as he usually does, made a \nvery good presentation for his side. The only problem is he made a very \nbad presentation about the amendment I had written. In criticizing it, \nhe is criticizing the Republican-run House of Representatives which \npassed this same amendment without dissent, including the one and only \nCongressman I know of who was an exterminator, Tom DeLay. So for all \nthe eloquence about pesticides, the one person who was involved in the \npesticide over there did not object.\n  And with all due respect to my colleague, I don't have to be lectured \nabout agriculture. I have been elected three times from my State. \nAgriculture is an enormous source of pride to our State. I visited \nthousands of acres of farmland. I want the Senator from Montana to \nunderstand something about my State and my farmers. Not one of them \ncalled and said: Oh, Senator Boxer, we want to dose babies and infants \nand pregnant women and fetuses with pesticides. Not one. So let's set \nthe record straight. Maybe he heard from some of his farmers. Not one \ncalled me.\n  Why? Because this is all scare tactics. They know we are testing \npesticides on animals. They know we are using computer modeling. They \nknow that research moves forward. I am one of the biggest proponents of \ndeveloping new pesticides.\n  Then he uses the scare tactics. My God, if we have this moratorium--\nwhich, by the way, was put in place by Republican and Democratic \nadministrations in the past--we won't be able to fight West Nile virus. \nBaloney. We are already using DEET. We know what to do. There are \ncontinuing studies and modeling going on. So let's get rid of the scare \ntactics.\n  I am offering a bipartisan amendment today that is the exact \namendment that passed the House without a dissenting vote. The only \npeople who don't like it are the pesticide makers. We have a chance to \ntake a stand for the health of our kids or with the pesticide makers. \nThat is just clear. We have a chance to take a stand with every major \nreligious organization in this country. I have the list of those. The \nNational Council of Churches, Jewish organizations, evangelical \nLutherans, the Catholic bishops, all weighed in. My amendment is a \nfaith-based amendment.\n  Then my colleague says: Let's not get emotional. Are we supposed to \nwalk in here and lose all of our feelings? Are we not supposed to have \nemotion if we lose, for example, a constituent in the Iraqi war? If we \nvisit Walter Reed Hospital, as many of us have done, are we supposed to \ncheck our emotions at the door when we are elected to the Senate? Let \nme tell you how I feel when I read about the kind of testing they are \ngoing to do which my colleague is endorsing with his amendment because \nhe is saying the EPA should hurry up and bring out their regulation. By \nthe way, he is wrong when he tells you it is a draft. It is a final \ndraft, and we have the proof that this regulation was about to go for \ncomment next week. So let's set the record straight.\n  Here is what my colleague supports. He supports an EPA regulation \nthat says there will be a limited number of scientific studies \ninvolving pregnant women, fetuses, newborn babies of uncertain \nviability or nonviable newborns. Imagine, dosing a fetus with \npesticides. Dosing a newborn baby. You want me to check my emotions at \nthe door? Sorry. I will not be here and allow a rule to go into effect \nwithout doing everything in my power to stop it that is going to dose a \ndying newborn baby with pesticides because some poor mother is \nconvinced to take $1,000 for it. This is just wrong. Why do you think \nwe have all of these churches opposing the Burns amendment and \nsupporting our amendment: We are appalled by the effort to go forward \nwith yet another report--that is the Burns amendment--that does nothing \nto guarantee the well-being of the children and other vulnerable groups \nwho are being subjected to pesticides by the chemical industry. We need \na moratorium.\n  This moratorium was voted for without a dissenting vote in the House. \nNow my colleague calls for a thorough review based on the National \nAcademy of Sciences standard.\n  There is not one mention of the National Academy of Sciences in his \nentire amendment. Not only is there not one mention there, there is not \none mention of the Helsinki Accords. There is not one mention of any \nprotocol that has ever been recognized nationally or internationally in \nhis amendment. It is a general amendment. It is exactly what the EPA \nwants because they have told us, they don't want to be hemmed in. They \ndon't want to have their options limited. They want to be able to dose \nor accept studies that dose people with chemicals whenever they want to \nand whoever these people are.\n  Here is what the EPA says they want: The promulgation of rules \nprescribing such details would unnecessarily confine EPA's discretion. \nWonderful. My opponent is giving them that discretion by not referring \nto any acceptable scientific guidelines.\n  Then my opponent defends the CHEERS program. I have never heard \nanyone defend the CHEERS program. The CHEERS program was going to be \ndone on these babies. Pay their parents in poor areas, give them a cam \ncamera, tell them to continue dosing their homes with pesticides and \nstudy the reaction of the children, when we already know it is \ndangerous for kids to be exposed to pesticides. My esteemed friend--and \nhe is my friend--actually gets up and defends this program which no one \nelse in America has done. But it speaks to the purpose of his amendment \nwhich is to move forward with a rule that would allow all of this.\n  My opponent says I am stopping all testing. False. The testing will \ncontinue--animal testing, computer modeling. Do you know what Stephen \nJohnson of the EPA has said about human testing? I think it is \nimportant that Members know. He certainly doesn't agree with Senator \nBurns because this is his quote:\n\n       We believe that we have a more than sufficient database, \n     through use of animal studies, to make licensing decisions \n     that meet the standard--to protect the health of the public--\n     without using human studies.\n  So my friend is contradicting Stephen Johnson, head of the EPA.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 7 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield myself 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The fact is the attack Senator Burns has made on my \namendment is false in every way. It is the same amendment as his \nRepublican friends supported over in the House without a dissenting \nvoice. It is the same policy that was put in place by Republicans and \nDemocrats. And then my friend says: Wouldn't it be a waste to throw \naway studies, even if they did intentionally dose human beings? Ronald \nReagan was faced with that same\n\n[[Page S7560]]\n\nissue. His head of the EPA said there are certain times when you don't \naccept studies because there is moral right and there is moral wrong. \nThat is why the Boxer amendment--supported by Senators Snowe and \nCollins, Senators Clinton and Obama and Nelson and others--is so \nimportant.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Corzine as a cosponsor of my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. To quote President Reagan's EPA, they said they would not \naccept human dosing type of experiments from World War II because they \nwere ``morally repugnant.''\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time? The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, my amendment, to answer the National \nAcademy of Sciences point, the six quantifying objectives, as \nmentioned, come from the book ``Intentional Human Dosage Studies for \nthe EPA, Respiratory Purposes, Scientific, and Ethical Issues.'' They \nwere taken from that book. The National Academy is found in the \namendment.\n  Again, we can characterize it any way we would like. I would just say \nthat we still base our decisions on history. This amendment is \nparamount. And I understand, nobody likes the idea of human dosing. If \nwe could get around it, if there was any sure way we could get around \nit, we would. I don't like it either. But nonetheless, as we talk about \nthis, we are holding up testing on the world around us. We cannot \nafford to lose any time or information. We owe that to the American \npeople, to the consumer. We also owe it to the people who produce food \nand fiber.\n  How much time is remaining on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 52 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, we have a vote coming up, and we probably \ncan get to that in the next 5 or 10 minutes, if that is OK with the \nSenator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely.\n  Mr. BURNS. If you want to close, I will make a short statement. Then \nwe will go to the vote.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Sure.\n  Mr. BURNS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this debate is a tough debate because when \nit comes to protecting the people of our country, there are going to be \nfeelings on either side. This is what it is about. The quote of James \nChildress of the National Academy of Sciences, chairman of the panel, \nwho said: A lot of us were troubled by the dosing studies. And \npersonally my view is that the House amendment--that is what my \namendment is--was within the range of ethically justifiable responses.\n  The fact is, there is no mention directly of the National Academy of \nSciences in my colleague's amendment. My colleague's amendment is just \na ``cover yourself'' amendment. I call it a ``CY'' amendment.\n  People can think they are doing something, but here is what I need to \ntell my colleagues: If they vote for the Burns amendment, they are \ntaking us back. They are telling the EPA to hurry up with their \nregulations, regulations that we know will test pregnant women and \nbabies. Every major religious organization views this as a faith-based \ndebate, and the Boxer amendment is on the right side of that debate. I \nhope Members will vote for the Boxer amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I will recap. Our approach is a commonsense \napproach. It just makes sense and logic that the information we need is \nonly found in the work that we do on the safety of pesticides, \nfungicides, herbicides, all of that. It becomes very important to the \nagricultural producers, but also it is more important to the safety of \nour consuming public.\n  It has been a good debate. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Is my friend going to ask for the yeas and nays on both \nhis and my amendment, his first and then mine second?\n  Mr. BURNS. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for the yeas and nays on the Burns amendment and \nthe Boxer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the yeas and nays may be \nrequested on both amendments.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to the vote in relation to the \nBoxer amendment.\n  Mr. BURNS. The Senator has 1 minute prior to the vote on her \namendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is very good.\n  Mr. BURNS. I ask unanimous consent for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Montana. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Utah (Mr. Bennett) and the Senator from Indiana (Mr. \nLugar).\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. \nLieberman) is absent due to death in family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1023\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the Boxer amendment.\n  Mr. BURNS. I yield to the Senator from California on her amendment. \nShe has 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if I could have Members' attention just \nfor one moment, I hope they will vote for this. The EPA is about to \nutilize studies that will actually intentionally dose babies with \npesticides, pregnant women with pesticides, newborns with pesticides, \nnewborns of uncertain viability, meaning they might die, nonviable \nnewborns. We are talking about a policy that has won the condemnation \nof every religious organization in this country who backed the Boxer \namendment.\n  The Boxer amendment passed without a single dissenting vote in the \nHouse. If Members voted for Burns they can vote for Boxer. All we are \nsaying is we need a timeout to look at this immoral policy. That is why \nwe have\n\n[[Page S7561]]\n\nthe Catholic bishops telling us that the intentional dosing of kids is \nimmoral and they are very concerned about it. That is why we have the \nsupport of the National Council of Churches. If my colleagues ever \nwanted to vote for a faith-based amendment, this is the amendment. \nStand on the side of the innocent, vulnerable kids and vote for the \nBoxer amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, it just makes sense that we do not suspend \ntesting at all, as this amendment would do. It is bad logic to throw \naside almost over 20 reports that give us the history and the \ninstitutional knowledge to complete the work for the safety of the \nconsumer and also the people who produce food, fiber, and shelter in \nthis country. I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1023. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BURNS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed do.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1025\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, by previous order, we move to the Dorgan \namendment No. 1025.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order to consider \namendment numbered 1025.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me describe the amendment. This \namendment is very simple. It does not require an elaborate explanation. \nIt provides additional resources, desperately needed resources to \nparticularly the Indian Health Service.\n  We have had a lot of discussion in the Senate in the last several \nyears about the Indian Health Service. We have a responsibility for the \nhealth of Indians under trust responsibilities to the Federal \nGovernment. The Federal Government also has a responsibility for health \ncare for Federal prisoners. It is interesting to note that the Federal \nGovernment spends almost twice as much per person for health care for \nFederal prisoners as it does to meet its trust responsibility per \nperson for American Indians.\n  If you travel to Indian reservations in this country, there is a bona \nfide crisis in health care on reservations and in other areas as well. \nGo to a reservation, and you will find a dentist practicing out of a \ntrailer house, a small trailer, for 5,000 people. That is the \ndentistry. Go to a reservation and find half a dozen kids have \ncommitted suicide recently. You will discover there is virtually no \nmental health treatment available for those kids who end up taking \ntheir lives.\n  There is such a desperate need to satisfy the obligation here for \nhealth care for American Indians. We are so short of funding, it is \nunbelievable. This amendment adds $1 billion to funding particularly \nfor Indian Health Service but also to the BIA to provide the other \nservices that are necessary on the reservations.\n  I have indicated we have a bona fide crisis in health care, housing, \nand education on Indian reservations. Let me tell a story I have told \npreviously about a young girl named Tamara Demaris. Tamara was a 3-\nyear-old. I read about Tamra in a newspaper. I met with her and her \ngranddad. She was 3 years old and placed in foster care by a person who \nwas handling welfare cases and so on. The woman who was handling the \ncase was handling 150 cases. So this was a case of a 3-year-old child \nwho was put in a foster care situation. But the person did not check \nout the home to which she was assigning the 3-year-old child. She was \nworking on 150 cases. So Tamara Demaris goes to this home. There is in \nthis home a drunken brawl and party. The aftermath of that drunken \nbrawl and party was this 3-year-old girl named Tamara had a broken \nnose, a broken arm, and her hair pulled out at the roots.\n  This is a 3-year-old child. That was our responsibility. We did not \nprovide sufficient funds for available resources to check the foster \nhome in which they would put this little kid. The result is this little \nkid is scarred for life.\n  I helped fix it on that particular reservation so that will not \nhappen now. But why did it happen? They do not have the resources. One \nperson handles 150 cases? That is unbelievable. A child gets injured, \nbadly. It is going on all across this country on Indian reservations.\n  Again, I have told my colleagues about a hearing I held in which a \nyoung woman who had just assumed the job on an Indian reservation--this \nwas for child welfare--said on the floor of her office was a stack of \nfolders with allegations of child abuse, including sexual abuse of \nchildren. She said they have not even been investigated. Those folders \nsit there without an investigation because they do not have the \nresources.\n  She broke down at the hearing and began to sob, began to cry. She \nsaid: I have to beg and borrow to try to get a car to take a kid to a \nclinic or take a kid to see a psychologist or get mental health \ntreatment. I don't have a vehicle, let alone the money to investigate \nthe cases in the files on the floor.\n  I could go on at great length about diabetes, about all of the issues \nfaced on these reservations.\n  My late colleague, Mickey Leland, with whom I traveled to many areas \nof the world, was a great humanitarian. He died when his plane crashed \ninto a mountain in Ethiopia. He was a Congressman who worked with me \nand others on hunger issues. Mickey Leland came to the three affiliated \ntribes in North Dakota to hold a hearing.\n  This is what we discovered that day in the testimony about diabetes. \nThey do not have double, triple or quadruple the rate of diabetes of \nthe rest of the population; theirs was 10, 12 times the rate of the \nrest of the population. It is a devastating situation on \nIndian reservations. It means people are losing their legs, losing \ntheir good health, losing their lives, sitting through dialysis in a \ncrowded room.\n\n  We have so many challenges to meet, and we are so far from meeting \nthem with the necessary resources. These are the first Americans. I am \ntalking about American Indians. They are the ones who greeted \nChristopher Columbus. These books that say Columbus discovered \nAmerica--I am sorry, he was greeted by the American Indians, the first \nAmericans. Yet we are not meeting our trust responsibility.\n  I suggest now is the time simply to take the step and say, if we care \nabout health care, if we care about funding for these needs on Indian \nreservations\n\n[[Page S7562]]\n\nin this country, let's do it. We have Third World conditions in some of \nthese areas. Sarah Swift talked about a grandmother who goes to bed, \nlies down on a cot, and freezes to death. She freezes to death in this \ncountry. This was a Native-American grandmother, an American-Indian \ngrandmother who at 35 below zero in the middle of the winter was living \nin a house that had only plastic sheeting on the window. She froze to \ndeath. One would think, if you read in the paper, it was a Third World \ncountry. No, that wasn't. That was South Dakota. We have to do better. \nThat is the purpose of my amendment.\n  This amendment is paid for with $1 billion we take from the Federal \nReserve surplus funding. Most of my colleagues--perhaps none of my \ncolleagues know--in the Federal Reserve Board, there is an $11 \nbillion--yes, I said it right--an $11 billion surplus fund. I call it \nthe rainy-day fund. They should not have it, first of all. The Federal \nReserve Board was created in the nineteen teens. We have a rainy-day \nfund so that if they run out of money, they have some money--$11 \nbillion. How do you run out of money when you actually create money, \nfor God's sake? The Federal Reserve Board does not need $11 billion.\n  Senator Reid and I had the GAO do an investigation of this back in \nthe 1990s. That was at a time when they had $4 billion to $5 billion. \nNow they have $11 billion squirreled away. I say take less than one-\ntenth of that and invest it in the health of America's first citizens, \ncitizens who now all too often are living in Third World conditions.\n  I will not describe at greater length the health challenges. I have \ndone it before in speeches in the Senate. I want one person to tell me \nit does not matter that a young kid is lying in bed today on an Indian \nreservation thinking of committing suicide, and tomorrow or the next \nday they may find that young child hanging from the closet as they \nfound Avis Littlewind hanging from her closet after missing 90 days of \nschool. Her sister, by the way, committed suicide 2 years before. The \nmental health services on that reservation did not exist to help these \nkids.\n  The question is, Do we want to help these kids? Do we want to meet \nour responsibility? Do we want to keep our promise and tell people this \nmatters? It does to me.\n  My hope is, with this amendment, my colleagues will finally decide to \ndo what is right and do what is necessary to invest in the things in \nwhich we need to invest to say to the Native Americans: Your health \nmatters, too. Your education matters, too. Housing matters for you as \nwell. That is our obligation.\n  I recognize I have to make a motion to waive the applicable sections \nof the Budget Act. The reason is because people with very small glasses \nand very narrow breadth of thought have decided that $11 billion \nsitting in a squirreled-away bank account as a rainy-day fund for the \nFederal Reserve Board, a board full of people wearing gray suits, \nliving in a concrete building, squirreling away $11 billion--there are \nsome people with these tiny glasses who decided this $1 billion cannot \nbe used for this because it would violate the Budget Act.\n  I might observe, however, that on previous occasions in the Senate \nother Members of the Senate have found a way to use a portion of this \nin the normal process. So I suggest perhaps there is not a greater need \nthan doing what we should do for the children I have just described and \nfor those who are suffering, those who are living in poverty, those who \nthrough no fault of their own are having a tough time. This would be a \ngreat way to reach out our hand and say to them: You are not alone. Let \nus help you up and out of this situation. Let us help improve your \nlives.\n  When my colleague rises, I am sure in aggressive support of my \namendment, I will ask for a proper waiver of the Congressional Budget \nAct.\n  I ask unanimous consent Senators Bingaman and Johnson be added as \ncosponsors of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, we have increased Indian Health Service \nthis year quite a lot at $135 million. I agree with my colleague from \nNorth Dakota--it does not cover all the bases. It is one of the places \nwe have increased the funds in this year's budget and this year's \nappropriation. Committees also provided $82 million over the \nadministration request for the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n  The increase comes at a time when all other agency budgets in the \nbill are not growing. In fact, many are declining. The EPA is reduced \nby $144 million below their current year level. The Forest Service is \n$648 million below theirs. The National Park Service is $51 million \nbelow theirs. I mention these reductions saying we have done everything \nthis committee could do to channel more money into the places needed. \nWe did that with regard to the Indian Health Service.\n  There are seven reservations in my State. We are very much aware of \nthe shortcomings. We have one reservation we are trying to work awfully \nhard with right now because there is a shortfall in health services. Of \ncourse, we are trying to take care of that, protect the integrity of \nthe tribe and also their budgets and their expenditures. We are trying \nto do that now. We have a real job on our hands as to how we balance \nthe act.\n  Right now, the offset the Senator from North Dakota has proposed is \nnot correct as CBO will not score that. This $1 billion, of course, \ncomes under another category.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BURNS. I will yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator uses the acronym CBO; some call it the \nConfused Budget Office. Is that the Congressional Budget Office or, on \nthis amendment, the Confused Budget Office?\n  Mr. BURNS. We will try the Congressional Budget Office.\n  Of course, there are other things that have entered into this. I have \noften wondered why they always call it OMB, Office of Management and \nBudget. I think maybe they call it OB. Nonetheless, we can kick that \naround.\n  It does not score with the Congressional Budget Office.\n  The pending amendment, 1025, offered by the Senator from North \nDakota, increases the discretionary spending in excess of the 302(b) \nallocation to the Subcommittee on Interior and Related Agencies of the \nCommittee on Appropriations. Therefore, I raise a point of order \nagainst the amendment pursuant to section 302(f) of the budget.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Budget Act \nof 1974, I move to waive the applicable sections of the act for the \npurpose of the pending amendment. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. I ask unanimous consent this vote be set aside and we have \nthis vote immediately after the debate as to 1026, which is the \namendment of Senator Sununu to this act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I guess I have some time remaining. I yield \nback that time.\n  We are awaiting the arrival of the manager of the Sununu amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1026\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, is my amendment the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. His amendment is the \npending business.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is 30 minutes \nevenly divided.\n\n[[Page S7563]]\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, we are preparing to vote on an amendment \nthat I think does justice to the taxpayers. It doesn't make any sense \nto have a timber program that costs the taxpayers nearly $49 million \nbut yields less than $1 million in revenue. Unfortunately, that is the \nsituation we have in the Tongass. A significant portion of funding goes \nto building roads that support the efforts of private timber companies. \nI don't think it is too much to ask to simply require that those \ncompanies pay the expense of the road building themselves and not ask \nthe taxpayers to provide that subsidy.\n  This is a straightforward amendment. It doesn't change any \ndesignation on land. It doesn't create any new wilderness area. It \ndoesn't create any new roadless areas. It simply says for timber \noperations to continue, the private timber firms must put up the money \nto build the roads.\n  I am a strong supporter and will remain a strong supporter of a \nmultiuse concept for the national forests. It makes sense because they \nare important places. They are places that should be able to be enjoyed \nfor recreation hunting or fishing or snowmobiling--and they have \neconomic uses as well. Where the taxpayers are concerned, where Federal \nfunds are concerned, we need to be a little bit more cautious, \nespecially in a time when we have $300 or $350 billion deficits. \nSpending nearly $49 million, which was the tally in fiscal year 2004, \nfor a program that yields revenues of $800,000 doesn't make any sense.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is interesting to stand before the \nSenate this afternoon to discuss this amendment in the context of \nfiscal responsibility. The amendment that is proposed by my colleague \nfrom New Hampshire is about eliminating a subsidy for the timber \nindustry. But when we look to it, it is very specific. It is not the \nelimination of subsidies for assistance throughout our National Forest \nSystem. It is just specific as to one national forest, and that is the \nTongass, located in the State of Alaska. If, in fact, what we are \nfocusing on today is looking at cost cutting, looking at efficiencies, \nlooking at elimination of Federal funding in areas where it doesn't \nmake sense, should we not be looking at this amendment and its \napplication across the country? Wouldn't the supporters want to hold \ntimber programs in all national forests to the same standards to \neliminate subsidies and financial waste?\n  When we look at a list of our national forests, we have some 111 \nnational forests spread across the country. Mr. President, 105 of the \n111 national forests spend more on their timber programs than they \ncollect in their receipts. This is not just focusing on the Tongass \nbecause it is way out of whack in terms of the costs that are expended \non the Tongass; 105 out of 111 of the national forests spend more on \ntheir timber programs than they collect in receipts. What we have today \nis an amendment that singles out the Tongass National Forest and no \nother national forest in the country.\n  Let's continue with the fiscal argument and how this doesn't work as \nit relates to the Tongass. According to the Forest Service, in fiscal \nyear 2004, it cost $6.05 per acre to manage the Tongass National \nForest, which is very comparable, if not more efficient, than most of \nthese other national forests for which we have the analysis.\n  Looking to the White Mountain National Forest in the State of New \nHampshire, to manage that forest on a per acre basis is $19.39. Again, \nthe Tongass cost per acre, in terms of management, is $6.05. Why aren't \nwe looking at what is happening in the White Mountain National Forest \nin New Hampshire?\n  The Forest Service has in place in the Tongass a program that is \ndesigned to produce 150 million board feet a year. Yet 238 million \nboard feet is on hold because of appeals and litigation. That is about \na year and a half of product that can't get to market because of \nlitigation. Seventy five percent of the costs associated with the \ntimber program in the Tongass are the result of NEPA appeals and \nlitigation. It is estimated that without these costs, the Tongass \ntimber program could produce on average of about a 13-percent profit \nmargin. So we recognize that we have some issues going on in the State \nof Alaska, particularly in the Tongass, that we are not seeing outside. \nWe understand that the rate of litigation or the incidence of \nlitigation in the Tongass is four times that of litigation that goes on \nwith sales in any of the other national forests.\n  The economic argument, I contend, doesn't hold up. You can't separate \nthe economic argument from the frivolous lawsuit argument. The reason \nthe costs are so high is because of the lawsuits. You solve the lawsuit \nproblem and you solve some of the economic problem.\n  It is interesting. The same organizations that are all about this \namendment in trying to shut down any road activity in the Tongass are \nthe same people filing the lawsuits. The reality is that the Tongass \nNational Forest is singled out because it has been on the hit list of \nenvironmental groups who really oppose all logging, specifically in the \nTongass.\n  I know my colleague's intention is not to change the status to \nwilderness. It is not to shut down the timber industry. But, in fact, \nthat is what the impact of this amendment would be, to effectively shut \ndown the industry in the Tongass. It would put hundreds of Alaskans in \nsmall rural communities out of work, communities that are dependent on \nthe timber industry for their survival. It would work to eliminate the \ntimber receipts that we receive in our schools that help educate our \nkids. It would devastate the economy in southeast Alaska, an economy \nthat has already been so hard hit. We are looking at unemployment rates \nso far above the national average and, in the Southeast, an average \nthat is absolutely unacceptable, 9 percent, 10 percent.\n  I understand it is not the intention of the Senator from New \nHampshire and the Senator from New Mexico to shut down the Tongass, but \nthat is what it is going to do.\n  If, in fact, we are going to talk about the fiscal side, if we are \ngoing to look to the elimination of subsidies, it should not just be \nabout the Tongass. Let's take a look. Maybe we need to have hearings in \nthe Energy Committee's Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests and \nbring everybody together, put them at the table--the timber industry, \nthe communities, the taxpayer advocate groups, environmental groups. \nLet's hear about it.\n  We have several colleagues who would like to speak on the amendment \nthis afternoon. Before I sit, it is important to correct the record. \nSupporters of this amendment have said that the Tongass spent $49 \nmillion on its logging program in 2004. In fact, the correct amount \nthat was spent on the Tongass program in 2004 was $22.5 million. They \nalso say that the revenue on the Tongass in this same time period was \n$800,000. In fact, it was $2 million. I want to make sure we have the \nnumbers straight as we are looking at this and where they are being \nspent.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator reserves the remainder of her \ntime. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, the issue here isn't the cost to manage a \nnational forest because we recognize national forests are special \nplaces. We want to manage them. We want to operate them. We want to run \nthem for the enjoyment of people, and different forests are going to \nhave different requirements and different costs associated with that \nmanagement. Whether it is $1 an acre or $1,000 an acre, we want them to \nbe run in an efficient way. It is not about the cost of management. It \nis not about the profitability of a timber program. As was pointed out, \nmost of the timber programs technically lose money on a profit-and-loss \nbasis. What it is really about is, in looking at those timber programs, \nshould the taxpayers pay for the costs of building the roads, or is \nthat a cost that should be borne by the private enterprise?\n  That is what this debate is about and the answer is no. Certainly, in \nthe case of the Tongass, that is an area where more money is being \nspent to build more roads to benefit private companies with the least \nreturn imaginable.\n  I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico.\n\n[[Page S7564]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding the \ntime.\n  I want to speak briefly in support of the Sununu amendment. This \namendment is simple. It is narrow. It is clear. It provides that none \nof the funds appropriated in the bill can be used to plan or construct \nnew logging roads for private logging companies in the Tongass. Some \nwould say: Why single out the Tongass? How does that relate to my State \nor the area of the country I represent?\n  I think we have to have a little context for this amendment. We are \ndebating an extremely tight budget for the Forest Service, one that \nsimply does not come close to meeting the needs of the National Forest \nSystem. That is the reality that is being brought on by the growing \ndeficits and the resulting cuts in spending.\n  Let me give a few examples of the cuts that are found elsewhere in \nthis bill. This bill cuts the State and Private Forestry account by $87 \nmillion. That includes a 45-percent cut in critical funding to protect \ncommunities from wildfires, leaving volunteer fire departments and \nother responders underfunded and leading to greater risk to life and \nproperty. This is made worse by a $353 million cut in the Federal \nWildfire Management account. It also includes a 30-percent cut in the \nForest Health Management account.\n  A program that rehabilitates and restores areas burned by wildfires \nis cut in this budget by 84 percent. The bill cuts more than $180 \nmillion from the Capital Improvements and Maintenance accounts, which \nfund the road construction and maintenance in the Tongass and in the \nrest of the country. That account already is more than $10 billion in \nthe red. So that gives people some sense of the extreme cuts that are \ntaking place elsewhere in the Forest Service budget.\n  In stark contrast to that are the accounts used to support logging in \nthe Tongass National Forest. Rejecting the President's proposed cuts in \nthose accounts, this bill would increase funding for logging programs \nin the Tongass. It takes money from the programs throughout the rest of \nthe country and puts it into the logging program in the Tongass.\n  That is why it is important that this amendment pass. We need to be \nsure that taxpayer dollars are going where the most good can be done \nfor the public. It is no wonder that Taxpayers for Common Sense, the \nNational Taxpayers Union, Citizens Against Taxpayer Waste, and many \nother organizations and businesses have objected to this program and \nthe funding that is being provided.\n  In February of this year, the Congressional Budget Office joined in \nand proposed eliminating the Forest Service timber sales in Alaska and \nelsewhere as a way to save taxpayers $130 million in 2006.\n  Mr. President, I believe this is a very meritorious amendment. I hope \nmy colleagues will support Senator Sununu and me on this. The Federal \ndeficit clearly is too high. It cuts critical programs in our States \ntoo deep. Taxpayer money is too precious for us to spend it in this \nway. This amendment would help correct that problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. I \nhave found myself in similar situations as the Senators from Alaska, \nwith my State of Nevada being singled out and, for this reason, I am \nvery sympathetic to their concerns. I believe that we cannot \noveremphasize the importance of this road funding to the people in \nsoutheastern Alaska. Local lumber jobs in the Tongass have decreased \nfrom 5,000 in 1990 to just a thousand today, putting a strain on the \nsurrounding communities. Furthermore, the price of lumber has \nskyrocketed in the United States. My State is home to Las Vegas, which \nis the fastest growing city in America. We have seen the cost of lumber \nand other products soar.\n  I believe it is important to preserve funding for these roads so that \nwe can continue to have a reliable supply of lumber across the country. \nI urge my colleagues to join with the Senators from Alaska in keeping \nthis small part of the Tongass accessible to development.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, it is always frustrating when different \npeople are working with different numbers. The suggestion was made that \nthe program costs about $22 million. I have here the Forest Service \nbudget submission for the coming fiscal year as well as data on fiscal \nyears 2004 and 2005. For this region's two forests, Chugach and \nTongass--there is no forest, paper, or timber program in the Chugach, \nso we have two line items. One is forest products, $23.342 million. The \nother is roads, $22.325 million. That adds up to more than $45 million \nin their budget estimate for fiscal year 2005. If you look at fiscal \nyear 2004, forest products is $27.379 million and roads is $21.273 \nmillion. That adds up to nearly $49 million. And if you look at the \ncoming fiscal year, fiscal year 2006, the budget request for forest \nproducts is $21.462 million and for roads it is $17.306 million. That \nadds up to almost $39 million.\n  I ask unanimous consent this list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S7565]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS29JN05.001\n\n\n[[Page S7566]]\n\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I applaud the Senator for his courage in \ntaking on this issue. I have watched the Senator from Alaska, Senator \nMurkowski, speak in a passionate and advocating fashion, and I admire \nher knowledge of the facts and her advocacy. Unfortunately, I am \nsupporting the amendment. It offers Members an opportunity to vote for \nthe taxpayers' interests and put a halt to wasting their hard-earned \ndollars for the construction of new roads in the Tongass National \nForest. The word ``new'' is key here because, according to the U.S. \nForest Service, the existing road system already allows loggers access \nto more timber than the average annual cut in the Tongass for the past \n3 years.\n  Not only do the existing roads--5,000 miles already bought and paid \nfor by taxpayers--offer access to more timber than the timber companies \ncan harvest, the Forest Service can't even sell the harvested timber at \nrates to recoup the costs of road construction and timber sale \npreparation.\n  So this program is a double insult to American taxpayers. Federal \nfunds are first used to construct Tongass roads and prepare the timber \nsale and then the Forest Service sells that timber for a fraction of \nthe federal investment.\n  My colleagues from Alaska have argued that this amendment singles out \nthis national forest from all the rest and they are simply seeking \nequal treatment for Alaska. The reason that this amendment recognizes \nthe Tongass is because it is the most consistently wasteful timber \nsales program in the entire National Forest System.\n  While we can't fix the entire broken Forest Service timber sales \nprogram today, we can fix this most egregious example of waste and \nmismanagement of scarce Federal dollars and that is the Tongass.\n  The Forest Service website indicates that road building in the \nTongass is by far the most expensive in the National Forest System, \nwith construction costs of $150,000 per mile--remarkable. At the same \ntime, the existing Tongass roads already face a $100 million \nmaintenance backlog.\n  My colleagues from Alaska have not denied the fact that hundreds of \nmillions of taxpayer dollars have subsidized the unprofitable Tongass \ntimber program, but instead have made the extraordinary argument that \n``the timber sales program on National Forests is not supposed to be \nprofitable''.\n  When Congress established the Forest Service as stewards of the \nNational Forests one hundred years ago, it was charged with the \nmanagement of these public lands for commercial, recreational, and \nother purposes for the benefit of the American public. I'm sure no one \nconceived of the situation in the Tongass which has been detrimental to \npublic interests for decades. Since 1982, taxpayers have provided more \nthan $850 million subsidizing the logging industry in the Tongass \nNational Forest alone. Between 1982 and 2002, cumulative losses for \nTongass timber sales reached $750 million, or an annual average loss of \n$37 million.\n  In 2004, the Forest Service spent more than $48 million on the \nTongass timber program, but took in less than $800,000 from timber \ncompanies. This amounts to a taxpayer subsidy of more than $160,000 per \nlogging job in the Tongass. Nice industry profit, but it is long past \ntime that we stop this.\n  Ironically, this program isn't even good for the Alaska economy. \nWhile a few hundred loggers are benefiting at taxpayers expense, many \nmore Alaskan jobs that depend on recreation, small-scale logging, and \ntourism-related industries are harmed by the extensive road building, \nclear-cutting, and resulting degradation of water and wildlife \nresources.\n  Perhaps that is why more than 1000 sporting and gun clubs as well as \nlocal businesses have joined with taxpayer and conservation groups in \nopposition to the construction of new roads in the Tongass and in \nsupport of this amendment.\n  Every once in a while, a State or community has to go through a \nwrenching change. It is time for a change in the Tongass National \nForest. I hope my colleagues will approve this amendment. Over time, I \nhope it will prove beneficial to the State of Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I yield a minute and a half to my colleague from \nIdaho, with the balance of the time to be yielded to my colleague from \nAlaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, yesterday, our friend and colleague from \nNew Hampshire said this amendment is not about being a wild-eyed \nenvironmentalist, but that it is about being fiscally responsible. So I \nam going to take the fiscally responsible side of that argument and \nsay, let us open Pandora's box. I think this amendment does it. This \nbill includes $254 million for State and private forestry assistance. I \ndoubt that New Hampshire gets any of that. It also includes $257 \nmillion for recreation, wilderness, and heritage management.\n  Should we not hold the recreational industry to the same standard we \nare holding the logging industry--no subsidy and everybody who hikes \npay your own way? That is part of the argument. If we are going to hold \nthe Tongass Forest to the standards we would be holding it to in this \namendment, to cut the resources--what about the community action \nprograms? The Senator from New Mexico said he made the decision--are we \nnot going to invest in the community forestry program for the State of \nNew Mexico and the communities that benefit from that? Cut them all. If \nthat is the principle we apply here, cut them all. Eighty percent of \nthe timber sales on public lands in this country to supply our fiber \nneeds are now held up in the courts for legal action. Those are the \nrealities, while the timber pours in out of Canada and cuts jobs out \nfrom rural America. That is exactly what is going on.\n  No, not a wild-eyed environmental logic, a fiscal logic; let's take \nout the programs for recreation and wilderness and trail maintenance \nand let the public pay their fair share.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss my \nvote on the Sununu-Bingaman amendment No. 1026 to the Interior \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 2006. I oppose the amendment due to \nmy concerns that it unfairly singled out one national forest in Alaska \ninstead of crafting a policy that may be implemented across the \nnational forest system.\n  The Sununu-Bingaman amendment would prohibit any funds in the bill \nfrom being used to plan, design, study, or construct new forest \ndevelopment roads in the Tongass National Forest for the purpose of \nharvesting timber by private entities or individuals. I understand that \nthe Federal Government subsidizes timber programs in all 111 national \nforests, including the Allegheny National Forest in Northwestern \nPennsylvania. While the amendment did not prohibit logging in the \nTongass, it would have created a special prohibition on new road \nbuilding for logging operations in that forest when compared to other \nnational forests.\n  If Congress is to craft rules pertaining to the Federal logging \nprogram, it should be done in a more constructive manner than offered \ntoday. The issues of road building, maintenance backlogs, and future \nlogging should be dealt with first by each national forest \nindividually, in the context of its management plan. Congressional \naction should be a last resort. If Congress should reconsider the \nFederal logging program, I urge the amendment's proponents to submit a \nplan for consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if the other side has time left, I will \nwait.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is controlled by the Senator from New \nHampshire and the Senator from Alaska.\n  Who yields time?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I think my colleague from Alaska will \nallow the other side to go next, if that is OK with my colleague.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. I yield our remaining time to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \nSununu-Bingaman Tongass amendment.\n  I support this amendment for one simple reason: it ends a fruitless \nsubsidy that costs taxpayers millions of dollars a year. Yes, I do want \nto see the\n\n[[Page S7567]]\n\nrare Alaskan Tongass rainforest protected, but that is not what this \namendment does. Let me be very clear about this point. This amendment \ndoes not place a prohibition on logging. It does, however, place a \nprohibition on taxpayers footing the bill for logging.\n  Alaska's Tongass National Forest contains represents the biggest \nblock of intact old-growth forest in Alaska and is the largest intact \ntemperate rainforest in the world. Yet the Tongass is the Forest \nService's biggest money-losing timber program. Since 1982, over $850 \nmillion has been lost on Tongass logging as a result of subsidies, \nuncompetitive bidding practices, and vastly undervalued timber sales.\n  We hear that this amendment will result in a loss of jobs. This \nargument concerns me because I recognize the timber industry's role in \nmy home State of Wisconsin. Upon closer examination, though, I \nunderstand that this year alone, U.S. taxpayers have spent $163,000 for \nevery direct timber job created by logging the Tongass. That is roughly \nfour times the average U.S. household income this year--and certainly \nmore than loggers in Wisconsin are getting paid in Federal dollars. \nSomething is wrong with this picture.\n  I support the Sununu-Bingaman amendment and urge my colleagues who \ncare about fiscal responsibility and care about the environment to do \nthe same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is unfortunate that some people don't read numbers \ncorrectly. The Tongass land use plan, for instance, cost $13 million. \nThe Forest Service spends most of its money in Alaska on planning and \ndesigning the roads and defending the lawsuits brought by the \nenvironmental organizations that encouraged these Senators to bring \nthis amendment. As a practical matter, of the 17 million acres in the \nTongass, 676,000 acres--4 percent of the forest--is subject to \nharvesting.\n  Some time ago, Congress decided the Forest Service should build the \nroads in Alaska--not the private industry but the Forest Service--\nbecause of fish and wildlife concerns, recreation concerns, and \nconcerns of those people who want access to the islands. There are no \nroads here. The reason we have this problem is we don't have Federal \nhighway money in this area. The area is almost as big as New England. \nThe only roads built there are for access to timber development. The \nstudy for those roads takes more money than building the roads. The \ndefense of the litigation takes more money than both. As a matter of \nfact, 75 percent of the money spent in the Tongass is spent for \nenvironmental concerns and defending the litigation that is brought \ntime and again against any contract to allow people to harvest timber.\n  Four times as many lawsuits are brought against timber sales in \nAlaska than are brought in all the rest of the country.\n  This amendment does not cut a dime from the budget--not one dime. It \nis not saving any money. It just says money cannot be spent in Alaska. \nWhere is it going to be spent? It is going to be spent in the other \nNational forests.\n  Mr. President, I will submit for the record a chart that shows that \nin the Tongass in fiscal year 2004, only $3.6 million was actually used \nin road support.\n  This is not a case of saving money. As a matter of fact, the Forest \nService's planning, designing, and construction of timber roads is for \nthe protection of the wildlife, the fish, and the scenic recreation \nareas for residents and visitors.\n  I do believe Alaska's timber roads are more expensive because of the \nenvironmental studies that must go on. They plan and design these areas \nfor years before we are allowed access to the timber. We do that, \nagain, to ensure the roads are designed properly.\n  This was a compromise with the environmental community. In years gone \nby, the private industry did build the roads. The environmental \ncommunity did not like it. They said we couldn't do it unless we have a \nplan and the Forest Service carries out that plan. It designs and plans \nthe roads and does all the environmental work that is not done in the \nprivate sector. Actually, only 25 percent of the money is spent for \npreparation and administration of these areas.\n  I do believe, unfortunately, that my friends are hiding the fact that \nthey are bringing an environmental amendment. This is not an amendment \nto cut money. I challenge anyone to show it will save a dime. It will \nnot save one dime because it does not cut money from this budget.\n  This is not about spending. If it were, it would apply to all \nforests. If Senators want to bring an amendment to reduce the budget, \nto cut the money for road building, then that would be another matter. \nThe Tongass has a better monetary rate of return per dollar invested \nthan 13 national forests and the same monetary return as 17 of them.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record two \ncharts following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1)\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is not a fiscal amendment. This is \nan amendment to require that no money be spent to plan, design, or \nconstruct roads. What for? For timber development. But timber roads are \nalso built for forest management, for fish and wildlife protection, for \nrecreation. The people involved in the administration of fish and \nwildlife laws use those roads. The hikers and campers use those roads. \nThe roads are built so pedestrians go across the bridges and do not go \nacross the bottom of the streams, as they used to. In the private \nsector days, the Caterpillars used to go right through the streams, \ndamage the streams, damage the habitat for fish and wildlife, and we \nchanged that. The Forest Service plans and designs the roads, and we \nconstruct bridges over every single little stream. We protect the \nenvironment.\n  Now we are being accused of spending too much money because why? We \nare protecting the environment and defending the lawsuits against the \nenvironmental groups that bring them.\n  I urge the Senate to reject this amendment. As I say, it does not cut \na dime from the budget.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n           fy 2004 timber road costs: tongass national forest\n\n       CMRD Allocation: $19.04 million.\n       Timber Purchase Credit: $228,000.\n       Maintenance: $3 million.\n       Timber Road Support: $3.6 million.\n       The Tongass National Forest's monetary return per dollar \n     invested is 2 percent.\n\n   THIRTEEN NATIONAL FORESTS THAT HAVE MONETARY RETURNS LESS THAN THE\n                                TONGASS'S\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               Monetary\n                                                              return per\n                        State/Forest                          $ invested\n                                                              (percent)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCalifornia--Los Padres National Forest.....................            1\nCalifornia--Mendocino National Forest......................            1\nCalifornia--Six Rivers National Forest.....................            1\nCalifornia--Plumas National Forest.........................            1\nCalifornia--San Bernardino National Forest.................            1\nIllinois--Shawnee National Forest..........................            0\nIndiana--Hoosier National Forest...........................            0\nMontana--Bitterroot National Forest........................            1\nNebraska--Nebraska National Forest.........................            0\nNew Mexico--Gila National Forest...........................            1\nNew Mexico--Lincoln National Forest........................            1\nOhio--Wayne National Forest................................            1\nTennessee--Land Between the Lakes NF.......................            0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSEVENTEEN NATIONAL FORESTS THAT HAVE THE SAME MONETARY RETURN PER DOLLAR\n                       INVESTED AS THE TONGASS--2\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               Monetary\n                                                              return per\n                        Forest/state                          $ invested\n                                                              (percent)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nArizona--Apache-Sitgreaves.................................            2\nArizona--Coconino National Forest..........................            2\nArizona--Coronado National Forest..........................            2\nArizona--Prescott National Forest..........................            2\nCalifornia--Cleveland National Forest......................            2\nCalifornia--Modoc National Forest..........................            2\nCalifornia--Sequoia National Forest........................            2\nGeorgia--Cattahochee-Oconee National Forest................            2\nKentucky--Daniel Boone National Forest.....................            2\nNew Mexico--Carson National Forest.........................            2\nNew Mexico--Cibola National Forest.........................            2\nNew Mexico--Santa Fe National Forest.......................            2\nNew Mexico--Tonto National Forest..........................            2\nNevada--Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest...................            2\nOregon--Ochoco National Forest.............................            2\nTennessee--Cherokee National Forest........................            2\nUtah--Manti-La Sal National Forest.........................            2\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I thank Senator Byrd. I will be very brief. \nI ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to speak as if in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Smith are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, there is a crisis in the veterans health \ncare system. The VA has belatedly admitted it is desperately short of \ncash and cannot make ends meet. What are the results? As a result, our \nveterans are in real danger of being shut off from the medical care \nthey so urgently need and so rightly deserve. They are already \nsuffering the indignity and the physical toll of understaffed medical \nfacilities and dangerous delays in treatment. This is a shabby way to \ntreat America's veterans.\n  There are some who will say it is premature to add emergency funding \nfor the VA to this bill and that we need to wait for more data to be \ncollected and more numbers to be crunched. I say we have waited too \nlong already. We have been hearing since the beginning of the year of \nthe difficulties the current budget shortfall has caused the VA \nhospitals and clinics around the country. Due to budget shortfalls at \nthe regional level, many of our local VA hospitals and clinics are \nbeing forced to institute hiring freezes and having to spend money set \naside for equipment and maintenance on health care.\n  Let me give Senators one example. According to information gathered \nby the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, the Togus Veterans \nMedical Center in Maine came up against a $14.2 million shortfall in \nmid-January for this fiscal year. To reduce the budget gap to $7 \nmillion, the center has diverted funds intended for equipment and left \nstaff vacancies unfilled. The facility has not been able to purchase a \nneeded magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, machine due to the budget \nshortfall.\n\n  That is just one example. The administration's plan to deal with the \ncurrent shortfall includes postponing $600 million worth of repairs and \nequipment such as the MRI machine that the Togus Medical Center cannot \nafford to provide to its clients. Sophisticated diagnostic and imaging \nmachines that produce MRIs, high-resolution X-rays, Sonograms, and CAT \nscans are essential to the delivery of first-rate health care.\n  We cannot have first-class health care in an outdated facility with \nsecond-class equipment. I am not willing to postpone fixing the roofs \nof clinics or purchasing needed equipment, and the VA should not be \nwilling to do so either.\n  The people at the VA headquarters do not like to talk about these \nproblems. They would like us to believe that everything is just fine. \nBut from the stories many of us--many of us on both sides of the \naisle--are hearing from our own States, we know better. The doctors and \nthe nurses and the medical technicians in the field who are working in \nthese understaffed, underequipped facilities, also know better. And our \nveterans--our veterans, the men and women who have put their lives on \nthe line; our veterans--who are bearing the brunt of the budget \nshortfall know better, also.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs continues to claim that it can \nwork around the budget shortfalls this year, but to do so, they will \nhave to rob Peter to pay Paul. By deferring spending for some items and \nshuffling money around in other accounts, the VA is just pushing the \nproblem off into next year and compounding the difficulties already \nfacing the VA health care system. Even Secretary Jim Nicholson admits \nthat this is not a one-time problem. According to his testimony \nyesterday before the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, the VA faces a \nbudget shortfall of about $1.5 billion--$1.5 billion, with a capital \n``B''--in fiscal year\n\n[[Page S7569]]\n\n2006. Mind you, now, mind you, Mr. President, this is on top--this is \non top--of the $1-billion-plus shortfall the VA is experiencing this \nyear.\n  Senator Patty Murray warned of this shortfall 2 months ago. She was \nright. She was right then and she is right now. One does not wait for \ndepth soundings to throw a lifeline to a drowning man, and we should \nnot wait for the administration to keep testing the water before we \nthrow a lifeline to our deserving veterans. The crisis in veterans' \nhealth care is now--now--now--and the time to act is now, today.\n  The Murray-Byrd-Feinstein amendment addresses the current shortfall. \nOur amendment provides $1.42 billion to restore the funding that the VA \nhas had to divert from current requirements to balance the books this \nyear and to provide a much needed shot of supplemental funding to the \nVA's regional operations.\n  I understand that our colleague, Senator Larry Craig and others, as a \nresult of his Veterans' Affairs Committee hearing yesterday, intend to \noffer a second-degree amendment to the Murray-Byrd-Feinstein amendment \ntoday that would round up--or round off--the amount of 2005 \nsupplemental funding for the VA from $1.42 billion to $1.5 billion. I \nwelcome Senator Craig's initiative. I hope we can come to an agreement \nthat the entire Senate can support. And I look forward, to cosponsoring \nSenator Craig's modification.\n  Make no mistake about it, this amendment addresses only the \nadministration's shortfall for 2005, which is why we are designating \nthese funds as emergency funds. This will not solve the problem in \nfiscal year 2006 or beyond. To address those problems, we call on the \nadministration--we call on the White House--to send up a 2006 VA budget \namendment immediately and to budget responsibly for veterans health \ncare in future budget requests.\n  But we cannot afford to wait until next year to address the immediate \nshortfall in the 2005 VA budget. This is not business as usual. This is \nnot business as usual. The ability of the VA to deliver health care to \nscores and more scores of veterans is at stake. I welcome my Republican \ncolleagues to the table. Come, sit down. Join us. I urge Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle--over to my right and those on my left--to do \nthe right thing for our Nation's veterans. The VA needs this money now. \nThe Senate has both the opportunity and the obligation to provide it \nnow. Let us not delay.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1071 To Amendment No. 1052\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I call up a second-degree amendment that \nis at the desk, the Santorum-Craig-Hutchison-Kyl amendment, and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum], for himself, \n     Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Craig, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Frist, Mr. McConnell, \n     Mr. Talent, Mr. Thune, and Ms. Collins, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1071.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 1, line 2, strike the word ``Sec'' through page 1, \n     line 9 and insert the following:\n       Sec. 429. (a) From the money in the Treasury not otherwise \n     obligated or appropriated, there are appropriated to the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs $1,500,000,000 for the fiscal \n     year ending September 30, 2005, for medical services provided \n     by the Veterans Health Administration, which shall be \n     available until expended.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, this is the amendment that was just \nreferred to by my colleague from West Virginia. It is an amendment that \ntakes the level of funding in the underlying amendment up to $1.5 \nbillion and has that money spread to where the need is the greatest \nwith respect to the problems and the shortages within the Veterans' \nAdministration. It leaves the Secretary the ability to make that \ndecision. We think that is vitally important, when there is a \nshortfall, that the money goes to where it is most needed.\n  I would say that I do this on behalf of the Senate Republican \nleadership. All of us in our meetings this week have been quite \ndismayed by what was apparently bad management, bad forecasting over in \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs, as well as the problems of \ncommunicating that information accurately to the Congress.\n  So as a member of leadership, we wanted to offer this amendment, in I \nthink very strong terms, to show our concern about the lack of \ncommunication, about the problems that were going on in the Veterans' \nAdministration in the health care area. It is vitally important, \nparticularly at a time of war, when we have a lot of our men and women \nwho have been injured in that war moving over from the Department of \nDefense health care facilities to the Veterans' Administration health \ncare facilities, that we get accurate information as to what the impact \nof that is and that we can budget for it accordingly.\n  In fact, in April of this year, as the Senator from West Virginia \njust alluded to, many of us on this side of the aisle voted against an \namendment by Senator Murray because of the understanding and assurances \nby the Veterans' Administration that there was sufficient funding to \nprovide for veterans health care. We were in error. Senator Murray was \nright. And I am not happy that we were put in a position to vote \nagainst an amendment that, as we now find out, was needed. But we got \nbad information.\n  So this is an attempt to rectify that situation. Let's hope it does \nnot happen again. It cannot happen again. I hope the fact that members \nof the Republican leadership are on this amendment, as well as the \nchairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, and the chairman of the \nsubcommittee of jurisdiction, Senator Hutchison, on the Appropriations \nCommittee, sends a very loud and clear message to the administration \nthat we like straight dealing when it comes to the issues of providing \nquality health care to our Nation's veterans.\n  I congratulate our colleagues over in the House and the chairman of \nthe Veterans Affairs Committee over there, Congressman Buyer, for his \nwork in digging and getting some of this information to the fore.\n  I was at a VFW State convention a couple weeks ago, on June 17, and \nwas asked some pretty pointed questions about veterans health care and \nwas told that there were real problems in our State of shortages and \nthe shifting of moneys. And so that was a Friday. The following Monday \nis when this hearing occurred--on June 20. Subsequently, as a result of \nthe input I was getting from veterans in that hearing, I sent a letter \nto Secretary Nicholson last week expressing my, shall I say, deep \nconcern about this and about this shortfall of funding and about the \nlack of candor on the part of the administration in telling us what was \ngoing on with the funding of our veterans facilities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letter dated June 24, \n2005 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                               Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 2005.\n     Hon. R. James Nicholson,\n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Department of Veterans \n         Affairs, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Nicholson: I write today to express my grave \n     concerns with Department of Veterans Affairs' fiscal year \n     2005 budget shortfall.\n       News of this shortfall is extremely disturbing in light of \n     your assurances that the Department of Veterans Affairs did \n     not need additional funding in fiscal year 2005 to care for \n     our nation's veterans. It was this assurance that influenced \n     me to oppose emergency supplemental funds for the Department \n     this spring.\n       Following the Senate's vote to reject these emergency \n     supplemental funds, my staff and I met with veterans \n     concerned about the immediate funding needs of the Department \n     of Veterans Affairs. During these meetings, I learned that \n     medical centers, because of financial constraints, had begun \n     shifting capital funds into health care accounts to maintain \n     health care services for veterans.\n       I am disappointed that the Department was not more \n     forthcoming about these financial constraints. Had the \n     Department been candid and transparent in its assessment of \n     financial needs during the current fiscal year, the outcome \n     of a recent Senate vote might have been very different.\n       So that we can be responsive to the health care needs of \n     veterans, I urge you to immediately begin working with the \n     White House, the Office of Management and Budget, and\n\n[[Page S7570]]\n\n     Congress to address the funding shortfall impacting the \n     Department in fiscal year 2005. With the support of Chairman \n     Craig and Chairman Hutchison of the Senate Appropriations \n     Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, I \n     am confident the Senate can address this shortfall.\n       In the future, when providing comment to Congress, I urge \n     you to be candid when asked for your personal views on \n     matters impacting the needs of the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs. There may be instances where you believe that the \n     Administration has erred or provided incomplete information. \n     We look to you to be the person who can inform Congress on \n     the needs of the Department and our nation's veterans.\n       I appreciate your consideration of this matter and please \n     know of my interest in working with you to address this \n     problem.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Rick Santorum,\n                                                      U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I expressed in this letter that I was disappointed the \nDepartment was not forthcoming, and I was hopeful they would come \nforward and let us know what was necessary, how much money was needed, \nso we could then respond. And as I mentioned in the letter, I was \nconfident the Senate and the House would respond.\n  I think what you are seeing here today is my prognostication is \ncorrect. We are going to respond, and we are going to respond with the \nmoney they say they need.\n  Now, I would suggest that if you look at the analysis that Senator \nByrd provided for us as to where this money is coming from, some of it \nwas unanticipated and, potentially, you could argue was something that \ncould not have been forecasted or budgeted with the number of people \nwho are transferred from the Defense Department over to the VA as a \nresult of the conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan. But a lot of this was \nsimply just poor administration and not accurately forecasting the \nutilization of the system.\n  I think we have to do a better job of understanding what the needs \nare, what the demands are and have a better understanding of what the \nbudget should be and accurately reflect that budget in submissions to \nthe Congress.\n  So I know the chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee in the \nSenate, Senator Craig, has had those kinds of candid conversations with \nthe Secretary. I know all of us look forward to working cooperatively \nwith the new Secretary in making sure we can get the information we \nneed to be able to properly provide for the health care needs of the \nveterans whom we have promised to serve.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for joining in putting this \namendment forward. I thank the Senator from Washington for her work and \nfor her diligence and early work in this area. I am glad we were able \nto work together. Hopefully, we will work in a bipartisan way not just \nto provide these resources but to make sure we get a better and more \naccurate accounting of the cost of providing the care that our veterans \nneed here in America.\n\n                   Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this Monday all over America there will be \ncelebrations regarding the Fourth of July, our Independence Day. It is \na time that we celebrate our independence, but at this time in the \nhistory of our country, we certainly must celebrate and salute our \nveterans. Jim Nicholson is a veteran. I am sorry I didn't acknowledge \nhis service to the U.S. military in addition to his being the chair of \nthe NRC prior to his taking over the job as Secretary of the Department \nof Veterans Affairs. I thank him personally for his service.\n  But I will not be lectured to about civility by the junior Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania who has repeatedly disrespected veterans. Three times \nhe opposed funding for veterans, votes in committee and here on the \nSenate floor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that his voting record be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S7571]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS29JN05.002\n\n\n\n[[Page S7572]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS29JN05.003\n\n\n\n[[Page S7573]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS29JN05.004\n\n\n\n[[Page S7574]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Now, with an election cycle upon us, he supports, under \npressure, voting for veterans. Talk about crass politics. The junior \nSenator from Pennsylvania can't run from his record. He owes the \nveterans more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have said throughout this debate--as I \nspoke on the supplemental, as I have been out here on the floor many \ntimes and in our committee--veterans are not a Republican issue; they \nare not a Democratic issue; they are an American issue.\n  I think what you see happening on the floor this afternoon is exactly \nto that point. I congratulate the Senator from Pennsylvania, as well as \nthe Senator from Idaho, Larry Craig, and the Senator from Texas, Mrs. \nHutchison, who have been working diligently with us in a nonpartisan \nway to address a real need, and that is to take care of the men and \nwomen who have served us so nobly in previous wars and in the current \nconflicts in which we are engaged.\n  From my side, I thank Senator Byrd, who stood with me valiantly as we \nhave worked to provide the funds for the men and women who are serving \nus overseas. I thank him for his leadership on this issue. I thank \nSenator Akaka, ranking member on the Veterans Committee, who has worked \nwith us to make sure that on our side we are provided with accurate \nstatistics and are moving forward.\n  At the end of the day who win are the men and women who serve us. It \nis a real tribute to this Senate that we are now standing here today \nwith the amendment offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania to add $80 \nmillion to our amendment, to now be providing $1.5 billion for veterans \nservices. We are here because we know when we ask men and women to \nserve us overseas, we tell them we will be there for them when they \ncome home. What you see on the floor this afternoon is Republicans and \nDemocrats standing together shoulder to shoulder to say in this body, \nwe will be there for our men and women who serve us overseas.\n  There is going to be a lot of blame to go around. I have been asked: \nHow did you know 2 months ago when no one else did? I started working \nwith our veterans who are returning from Iraq and Afghanistan late last \nyear, beginning in January, and hearing the same stories that Senator \nSantorum just talked about of how our VA facilities were turning vets \naway, how there wasn't enough care, particularly for post-traumatic \nstress syndrome.\n  I think we all know that in the conflict that is before us today in \nIraq, it being a 360-degree war where there is no front line to return \nback from, we are going to see a number of our service men and women \nincreasingly needing that kind of care. We are also seeing that \nfacilities that have not been maintained well were counting on the \nappropriations that we had this year. We are talking about veterans \nfrom previous wars who are now turning 60 and needing more health care \nbeing turned away. I think I began to look realistically at the numbers \nfrom the VA and became concerned that their projections were not based \non the reality of what was occurring, which is why I offered my \namendment to the supplemental.\n  I especially pay tribute to Senator Larry Craig from Idaho. When \nSenator Akaka and I offered the emergency supplemental bill, he was \ngiven a letter from the VA that said: We don't need any money. This is \nnot a crisis. Our projections say that we are just fine.\n  So Senator Craig and others from the other side opposed us on that \namendment at that time. But Senator Craig said to me on the floor, if I \nam proved wrong, I will stand with you to make sure we provide the \ndollars for our veterans that are required. Since he was told by the \nVeterans' Administration last Thursday that there is, indeed, a \nshortfall of $1.5 billion or more--I hope it is not more, but at least \nthat much--he said that he would work with me, and he has kept to his \nword. This is a real tribute to this country that we can come together \non an issue such as this, recognize that errors have been made, but it \nis time to move on, time to provide the dollars.\n  I see Senator Hutchison from Texas who has been working with us as \nwell. I want my colleagues to know we are going to stand shoulder to \nshoulder to meet this debt in front of us. I want to work with all of \nyou so we have the right projections for next year as Senator Hutchison \nputs her 2006 appropriations bill together so we are not sitting here 6 \nmonths from now, a year from now, 2 years from now saying we were wrong \nagain. This has given us a tremendous opportunity to get it right. I \ncan't think of anybody it is more important to get it right for than \nthose who serve our country.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I was in my office as I heard the Senator debating. I \nwould like to ask a question through the Chair. I am heartened by the \nfact that this is such a strong bipartisan effort. I salute Senator \nCraig, in particular, who joined us in the press conference as soon as \nthere was an announcement of this shortfall, and I salute your efforts \nto bring this issue before the Senate which you have worked on \ndiligently for months.\n  You made a particular reference to post-traumatic stress disorder, \nwhich is a concern I have within the Veterans' Administration. I would \nlike to ask you if you believe these additional funds will allow the \nVeterans' Administration to put appropriate professional staff at \nclinics and hospitals to deal with veterans not only from wars in the \npast but currently coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as \nfamily therapy for their families, if they are faced with this \ndisorder.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I assure the Senator from Illinois that it is my \nunderstanding that this money in the amendment that has been offered by \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania is specifically for medical services \nprovided by the Veterans Health Administration which does include \nmental health services and post-traumatic stress syndrome.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Washington again. This is \nsomething that is growing in intensity and seriousness. It has been \noverlooked in previous wars. Our veterans have come home with scars \nthat are not visible but which are serious and affect their lives. I am \nhappy to hear the amendment by the Senator from Pennsylvania, as well \nas the Senator from Washington, is going to address this important \nchallenge. I thank them for their leadership on both sides of the \naisle.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I know there are a number of other \nSenators who would like to speak. Certainly, I would like to yield to \nthe Senator from West Virginia. Let me say, again, that I appreciate my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle for coming together with us \nright before the Fourth of July recess. I can't think of a better time \nfor all of us to send an American issue forward and to stand up for our \nvets. I thank them for working with us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania and the other Senators, including Senator Craig, for their \noffering of this amendment. As I indicated earlier, I want to be a \ncosponsor of the amendment, and I ask the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania if he would ask that I be included as a cosponsor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom West Virginia be added as a cosponsor to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor as \nwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield to the chairman of the subcommittee of the \nAppropriations Committee that is responsible for the veterans \nappropriations, Senator Hutchison, such time as she may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to, first of all, read the \ncosponsors of the amendment in the proper order. They are Senators \nSantorum, Hutchison, Craig, Kyl, Frist, McConnell, Talent, Thune, \nCollins, Murray, and Byrd. That is the order of everyone coming on \nboard. I so appreciate Senator Murray and Senator\n\n[[Page S7575]]\n\nByrd also being cosponsors of this amendment. Frankly, all of us were \ntaken aback last week when we got this information, and we did come \ntogether in a bipartisan way to try to address the issue very quickly. \nThat is why we are now trying to put an emergency amendment on the \nvehicle that is on the floor today. We want to make sure the Veterans' \nAdministration has the money it needs and that it doesn't take from \nother very essential accounts, such as maintenance or capital. We want \nto have sound financial management as well as serving veterans needs.\n  It would be terrible to go into the next fiscal year, starting \nOctober 1, in any kind of a deficit situation. My bill, the Veterans' \nAdministration and Military Construction Appropriations bill, was \nscheduled to be marked up tomorrow. Clearly, when we heard that the \nVeterans' Administration did have problems with its projections, we \ndecided to put that off until mid-July. I hope--and it is my \nintention--by mid-July to have better information so that we will know \nwhat the $1.5 billion will cover between now and October 1 and what is \ngoing to be necessary for the 2006 budget, if anything, beyond the $1.5 \nbillion. I will say that through the great cooperation of my ranking \nmember, Senator Feinstein, and the chairman and ranking member of the \nfull committee, which would be Senator Cochran and Senator Byrd, we \nwere able to get $1.3 billion above the allocation that we had \noriginally been given for veterans even before this happened. So \nbecause of Senator Cochran, Senator Byrd, and Senator Stevens, we were \nable to go forward with an extra $1.3 billion, knowing that the \nVeterans' Administration has been called on more than any projections \nwould have anticipated. But today we are trying to now pass $1.5 \nbillion over and above that $1.3 billion for 2005 purposes so that we \nare in a sound financial situation.\n\n  The President, speaking last night, started reminding people why we \nare in a war on terrorism and what it means to America and what it \nmeans to our security. Part of the war on terrorism, part of any war \nfor freedom, is making sure that those Active-Duty and Reserve units \nserving right now with boots on the ground know that if they are \ninjured, if they can no longer serve because they are injured, when \nthey leave the service they will be taken care of. That is part of our \nresponsibility as the stewards of our Government and certainly our \nappropriations process.\n  As the chairman, along with my ranking member, Senator Feinstein, of \nthe committee that will be doing the appropriations for veterans, this \nis an amendment that is very important. It is an emergency, and it will \ntake us into fiscal year 2006 so that we will not have any kind of \nfiscal restraints. But we certainly are going to have to look at fiscal \nyear 2006 as we go down the road and work with the Veterans' \nAdministration and the OMB and our Democratic colleagues and our House \ncolleagues to make sure that we are not in any way shortchanging the \nveterans.\n  I am pleased to work with Senator Santorum representing the \nleadership on our side of the aisle, and Senator Murray and Senator \nByrd and the leaders on their side of the aisle to come together \nthrough the second-degree amendment offered by Senators Santorum, \nHutchison, Craig, Kyl, Frist, McConnell, Talent, Thune, Collins, \nMurray, and Byrd. This second-degree amendment will bring us in line, \nand it will assure that the Veterans' Administration has the \nflexibility to put this money where it is needed. That was a very \nimportant part of the amendment.\n  Also, it is important we keep the projects that are in the pipeline. \nThere are veterans hospitals and clinics that are in the process of \nbeginning to be built. We certainly did not want those to be delayed \nbecause the administration was having to use money for those purposes \ninstead for the operations of this year.\n  I am pleased to be a part of this amendment, pleased to work with the \nSenator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from Washington and the \nSenator from West Virginia, along with Senator Craig, who has done an \noutstanding job as chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. When we \nstarted working on this issue a few days ago, both of us talked to \nSecretary Nicholson. We talked to Josh Bolton at OMB to try to get the \nbest approach. It is still up in the air exactly where this will come \nout. But I know we are working in a bipartisan way to do what is right \nby our veterans, to work with the administration. I know it is our \nPresident's clear commitment that we will assure there is no shortfall \nin the Veterans' Administration. This emergency appropriation will make \nsure that is the case.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I wish to thank the very distinguished \nsenior Senator from the State of Texas for her leadership, her \ndedication. She is a member of the Appropriations Committee, a very \nfine member. I thank her for her leadership, and I thank her for her \nkind remarks today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Feinstein be added as a \ncosponsor of the amendment that has been offered by the distinguished \nSenator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Santorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased about Senator Byrd's \ncomments and especially to have Senator Feinstein as a cosponsor of \nthis amendment. She has been a part of this process all through the \ntime we have wrestled with it. She has more veterans in her State than \nall of us do, so it is quite appropriate for her, as one of the leaders \nin this area, to be a cosponsor. I thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nConrad and Mikulski be added as cosponsors to the original amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield to the ranking member on the Veterans Committee, \nthe Senator from Hawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to laud this bipartisan effort \nto address the funding crisis in VA health care.\n  Yesterday, the Veterans Affairs Committee held a hearing on VA's \nadmission that it is more than $1 billion in the hole this year.\n  With this announcement, we have the long overdue realization that VA \nhospitals and clinics are in crisis.\n  I think one of the lessons we can all take from this is: reach out to \nVA nurses and doctors and reach out to the veterans service \norganizations.\n  So many advocates have been bravely forthcoming about the desperate \nfinancial picture in VA over the past 6 months.\n  I welcome the administration's admission that there is a shortfall. \nBut I caution that VA officials are not the only source of information.\n  By waiting for this revelation, we forced veterans to wait longer for \nneeded care and providers to go for months with substandard medical \nequipment.\n  That said, I am delighted that we now have bipartisan recognition \nthat there truly is a problem at VA. Both sides of the aisle are now \nworking together to improve the quality of care for our Nation's \nveterans.\n  We shared with the Budget Committee what was needed for next year. \nThis was based on early warnings from sources out in the field. And we \nraised the funding issue twice on the Senate floor.\n  During the budget resolution debate in March, I offered an amendment \nto increase VA's funding by $2.8 billion for next year. With the \nsupport of my colleagues, I stood before this body and outlined the \ncase for a significant increase for VA.\n  But we were rejected because the administration claimed VA needed far \nless.\n  Then, again, during the war supplemental debate in April--while VA \nwas beginning to see signs of a problem--we were denied in our efforts \nto secure more funding for this year.\n  Again, this was due to the administration's failure to acknowledge \nthe plight that VA providers and patients were facing.\n  I do not believe that this is a scenario my colleagues would like to \nrepeat in the future. Waiting until VA\n\n[[Page S7576]]\n\nhits rock bottom and then taking action is simply not rational. We can \ndo better.\n  Clearly, we have been able to force this issue, and now we do not \nhave to wait for the administration. Let us move to fix the problem and \nfulfill our obligation to our veterans.\n  Because at the very least, this crisis will result in deferred \nmaintenance, as VA is raiding capital accounts just to make ends meet. \nAnd my colleagues familiar with the military know that deferred \nmaintenance puts troops in danger.\n  The same is true for veterans in need of health care. The purchase \nand replacement of equipment directly impacts the quality of care \nprovided.\n  Raiding money for capital projects means that needed VA clinics are \nin jeopardy. I remind my colleagues that there are more than 120 new \nclinics waiting to be opened.\n  The list of jeopardized clinics includes locations in States where \nrural access to health care is a serious issue--such as in Maine, North \nDakota, Texas, and 11 clinics in Tennessee alone.\n  In closing, I too appreciate the work that Senators Craig and \nHutchison and our other colleagues have done to tackle this problem. I \nbelieve we have found a solution.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nLincoln be added as a cosponsor to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we have a number of colleagues who wanted \nto come and say a few words about this amendment and about service for \nveterans. I urge them to come to the floor, because it is clear we are \nready to move at any time. If anybody has additional comments, please \ncome.\n  I have been out on the floor several times over the last several days \nand I have expressed my anger at the Veterans' Administration for not \nbeing up front and honest about the numbers in the projections, even \nthough it was clear to those of us looking at the numbers that we were \nfacing a very severe crisis in the VA. That was the reason I offered an \namendment for the Veterans' Administration on the emergency \nsupplemental. It is why I have repeatedly raised this issue throughout \nthe budget process, appropriations process, and throughout the last \nseveral months.\n  I think it is very clear that those of us who have been out on the \nground talking to our veterans know this is a crisis. Yesterday, the VA \ncame before the Veterans' Committee. Senator Craig had a hearing and \nhad the Secretary before us. He was continuing to say we could fix this \nproblem today by taking money from construction and maintenance \nprojects that we had appropriated and allocated money for for 2005. I \nthink it is very clear that the Senate now shortly will be on record \nsaying we believe those maintenance projects need to go forward, that \nthose construction projects need to go forward, and the medical \nequipment promised to our VA services needs to be in place. That is so \nimportant.\n  I was in Iraq a couple months ago, and our service men and women from \nWashington State met with me there. The very first question they asked \nme was: Is my country going to be there for me when I get home? Will I \nhave health care?\n  I feel it is important that when we look our soldiers in the eye, we \nanswer them honestly. Today, with the Senate going on record with an \nemergency supplemental to deal with this, we are going to be able to \nsay we are doing the best we can to make sure the services are there. I \nurge the Veterans' Administration to do the same. I think it is \ndisheartening and disconcerting to all of us when we rely on the \nSecretary and his agency to make sure they are honest about what the \nnumbers are and they are incorrect. We need that so we can do our job \nin providing for our service men and women.\n  We are doing that with this amendment today. We all know there is \nwork to come, and with the 2006 budget and appropriations bill, we need \nto have an honest assessment. We cannot continue to project a 2-percent \nincrease for veterans when we already know the number of men and women \ncoming back is much higher than that. We already know that the service \nmen and women, particularly from the Vietnam war, who are reaching the \nage of 60, are increasingly accessing our veterans facilities. We \nalready know that the maintenance projects out there are critical. We \nhave to do the right thing. We have to make sure the funding is there.\n  Again, I commend Members on both sides of the aisle. I see the \nSenator from Idaho, Senator Craig, is here. I take this opportunity to \nthank him. He has been most generous in working with us, as we have \nmoved this issue forward because information given to him that was \nerroneous at the time. He did give me his word that should things \nchange, he would be there to work with us. He has kept his word in an \nadmirable way, bringing the Secretary before the committee, working on \nthis amendment on the floor, and he is here to speak as well. I tell \nhim how much I appreciate his forthrightness and his willingness to \nwork with us to solve this dilemma.\n  We will be voting on the Santorum amendment, which adds $80 million \nto our amendment that has $1.42 billion, making sure we have a total of \n$1.5 billion to provide for our veterans services for the 2005 budget \nand make sure we don't have to go into funds for other projects and put \nthem in a waiting line, which would be a disservice.\n  I urge our Democratic colleagues who want to speak to this amendment \nto come to the floor as soon as they can. I thank my colleagues for \nworking with us, the House, and the White House to hopefully have a \nsupplemental in place before the July 4 recess.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I will yield time to the chairman of the \nVeterans Affairs Committee. I thank Senator Hutchison, whose principal \nresponsibility is the appropriations process. I thank her and her staff \ntremendously for the work they have done. I thank Senator Craig and his \nstaff for the tremendous work they have done, in coming forward and \ndigging and getting the proper language for this amendment so we can \nprovide funding for this year and for next year, as it is needed, to \nmake sure we are providing the quality care our veterans deserve.\n\n  With that, I yield such time as he may consume to the Senator from \nIdaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho, Mr. Craig, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank Senator Santorum, a member of the \nRepublican leadership, a gentleman who has brought forth this \namendment, who recognized the problem that has very rapidly emerged in \nthe last several weeks with veterans health care.\n  At the outset--and I know a good deal has already been said and we \nare collectively working on this issue--health care, as you know, is a \nvery dynamic entity. It is subject to a variety of forces that are not \nas predictable as we would like to have them be in the normal budgeting \nprocesses of Government.\n  The difficulty inside the Veterans' Administration today is health \ncare. That is the area that is consuming these large amounts of dollars \nat this moment at a very aggressive rate, just like health care is \ncosting more everywhere around the United States, both public and \nprivate.\n  We found in the last several weeks something that we didn't know a \nmonth or two ago. It is something I wish we had known. I stood here on \nthe floor telling my colleagues one thing, both in a supplemental and \nin amendments, as it relates to veterans' needs and, therefore, \nveterans health care services that at that time was not true. It was a \nfrustration to me and an embarrassment. But that doesn't mean I \nhunkered down or that anybody else did. It means we solve a problem, \nbecause while we are dealing with a dynamic entity known as veterans \nhealth care, we are first and foremost concerned about caring for \nveterans and making sure they have access to the health care system we \nhave promised them, and that they are being provided the best care.\n\n[[Page S7577]]\n\n  Having said all of that, we were talking about a 2006 budget, feeling \nwe had adequately resourced a 2005 budget. Here is what we didn't know, \nand probably some have already talked about it; that is, the \npeculiarity of the budgeting process inside our Government and inside \nthe second largest bureaucracy in Government, known as Veterans' \nAdministration--the difficulty of projecting a reasonable, contemporary \nbudget 18 months out from implementation.\n  We did not do it well. The Veterans' Administration did not do it \nwell. The actuarial organization that was doing it for the Veterans' \nAdministration and has a great reputation around the country did not \nhave a model that was feeding in all the right indices. So they were \nlooking at 2003 expenditure levels in veterans health care to project a \n2005 budget and factored in about a 2.3- or 4-percent growth rate. That \nis what we thought would work.\n  It did not work. It did not work for a lot of reasons. It did not \nwork because the model was probably wrong. It did not have all the \ninflationary costs in that were needed. It did not foresee that in \n2003, 2004, and 2005 we would invest nearly 10 percent more on an \nannualized basis in the veterans health care system and that it would \nimprove it to the extent that it became a health care system of first \nchoice to veterans when to some it had been a health care system of \nsecond choice.\n  You know the old adage: Build it and they will come. We did. We \nimproved it dramatically, and they came. They came in numbers that \ncould not be addressed effectively by the models. That is one part of \nthe problem.\n  Here is the other part of the problem: The 2003 numbers had no \nreflection of Iraq, no reflection of Afghanistan, no reflection of \nactive service personnel who would find themselves substantially \ninjured in a way that they would have to seek the services of the \nveterans health care system. That is something in the 30-plus-percent \nrange of these new figures.\n  The Veterans' Administration began to see this problem and did not \ncommunicate it to us effectively and responsibly. Then they did their \nmidyear review. If you were going to graph this, you would have to \ngraph it as a spike. All of a sudden, they saw their numbers spiking \nup. So that 2003 model of actuarial soundness of service at 2.3 percent \nall of a sudden becomes a 5-plus percent, 5.3, 5.4. Some would say, 3 \npercent in big business is not a bad miss. But 3 percent in a nearly \n$80 billion budget is big money.\n  When it comes to delivery of services, when it comes to the \nimprovement of services, and you have to curtail that to fund other \nkinds of services, you have a problem. That is where we are today.\n  The Senator from Washington is absolutely right. Her view of it was \ndifferent than mine at the time. She saw a different picture and \nproposed a different level of funding. I opposed her at the time, \nbelieving the numbers I had were accurate. I was successful. But I did \ntell her that if these numbers changed, if there were any indication of \nchange, I would be the first to tell her and we would be back solving \nthis problem. Why? We may disagree on some things, but we do all agree \non one thing, and that is that the service to America's veterans should \nnever be jeopardized and that we would stand united and bipartisan in \nthat effort.\n  Within 4 or 5 hours after I knew these numbers, I was visiting with \nthe Senator from Washington. The Senator from Texas, who has been an \nactive partner and is chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee for \nMILCON and Veterans Affairs, was engaged with us immediately, and we \nbegan to try to figure out how to solve the problem.\n  Solving the problem is getting the best numbers we can get in as \nfactual a way as we can get them. I must tell you that all of us were a \nlittle suspicious that we had not been told what we needed to be told \nin a timely fashion. That is why I insisted and Secretary Nicholson \nresponded yesterday to the full committee with a very valuable hearing \nin which a lot of these issues began to be laid out.\n  I must also tell you I believe the Secretary was every bit as \nfrustrated as we were. He is new on the job, but he is a very skilled \nand successful businessman. If there is one thing he believes in, it is \ngetting the numbers right and being able to deal from a position of \ntruthfulness and understanding. You do not work that way in Government. \nYou sure do not work that way in business, and Secretary Nicholson \nknows it. He was very forthright with us and very clear in what is \nnecessary.\n  Do we know at this moment exactly what the numbers ought to be? No, \nwe do not. The fair analysis is we do not, but we have a very good idea \nof where they probably will be and what is most important at this \nmoment. As the agency borrows from one account and uses up another \naccount, we effectively replenish that so services do not go lagging in \ncertain areas.\n  As important is that the capital expenditure and the reinvestment in \nequipment and health care-related services to our veterans stays on \nschedule so the quality of health care to America's veterans does not \nslip.\n  While we are figuring all of that out, and they are scrambling at \nthis moment--they, the Veterans' Administration, along with the Office \nof Management and Budget--while they are scrambling to get the numbers \nright, we are going to act. You can see by the character of what we are \ndoing now it is going to be bipartisan once again, and we are going to \nstand united in behalf of America's veterans.\n\n  The Republican leadership understands that, the Democratic leadership \nunderstands that, I as chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee \nunderstand that, the ranking member, Senator Akaka, who has been on the \nfloor, clearly understands that, and certainly Senator Murray, who has \nbeen a strong advocate for veterans, understands that.\n  I see the Senator from West Virginia on the floor, Mr. Rockefeller. \nHe, too, has been the same and, of course, Senator Kay Hutchison of \nTexas, now chairman of the subcommittee that appropriates all this \nmoney, understands it. It is why we want to speak in a united voice \ntoday on behalf of America's veterans.\n  While that is going on, we have to figure out the rest of the story, \nand that we will. It will be accurate, and we will make sure that \nthis--you never say ``never''--will not happen again. But I have had \nconversations with the Secretary, and he is a very frustrated Secretary \nat this moment to find out on his watch that the numbers are not right \nand that what he was advocating has now slipped out from under him.\n  I am confident that he, working with his people, and the system will \nnot only come up with a better way to do the numbers, but we are going \nto be insistent they come up with a better way to do the numbers. We \nare going to be insistent they report to us, not on an annual basis, \nbut how about a quarterly basis, how about a quarterly analysis of \nwhere the expenditure of this kind of money is, because it is big money \nserving an awful lot of needy and worthy people, and we want to make \nsure it sustains itself in the appropriate way.\n  We also understand the limited nature of the public resource. It is \nnot an endless system of money. We would expect efficiencies at the \nVeterans' Administration. We would expect responsibility at the \nVeterans' Administration. And what we do not expect and what we will \nnot have happen again is for them to quietly think they can spend the \nmoney out and then, knowing they can come back to us and under the \nargument of motherhood and responsibility to America's brave men and \nwomen, we are going to fork over more money and never look back. This \nis one chairman who will look back, who is going to demand that systems \nare accurately accounted for, and that there is a reasonable and \nresponsible quarterly measurement of the resources expended and the \nresources allocated.\n  As much as we owe to the veterans, we owe to the American taxpayers, \nwho have agreed to help these veterans, a similar kind of \nresponsibility and dedication to cost. That is not an unmanageable, an \nunsolvable, or an unmergeable concept. That is what we are about here, \nto deal with this in a direct way, and that we will. I think we are \ngoing to see a very strong vote today in behalf of what we are \nproposing.\n  The House is struggling with the numbers now. They may do something \ndifferently. But in the end, we will come together.\n\n[[Page S7578]]\n\n  Our language is specific in one form. It is specific in recognizing \nthat we do not have the exact figures yet. So we say the moneys that \nthis authorizes are to be expended in 2005 and 2006, and then the \nchairman of the appropriations subcommittee and I and the ranking \nmember--all of us together--will look at the 2006 needs in light of \npotential carryover that could come out of the appropriation we are \ntalking about here. We will bring those numbers together and, very \nfrankly, we will bring them together in a way that will cause the \nVeterans' Administration to come forward on a quarterly basis to report \nto us about their categories of expenditures and where they are in all \nof this issue.\n  We have to know the numbers. They have to be accurate. Our cause to \nserve America's veterans cannot be modified, nor will it be deterred. \nBut it has to be accurate and it needs to be responsible. I support \nthis amendment. I think it is the right thing to do now. It is now our \njob to make sure the future is one that is clear, understandable to \nall, and, most importantly, responsible both to the veteran and to \nAmerica's taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nJohnson, Kennedy, and Lincoln be listed as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield to the Senator from West Virginia whatever time \nhe may use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank the floor manager, and I \nthank the chairman of the committee who had a lot to say and who \noperates the committee in a spirit which is very bipartisan and which \nis aimed at trying to solve problems. I say that at the beginning of \nevery meeting and I say it here on the Senate floor.\n  I rise to support the Murray-Byrd amendment. It responds to a VA \nfunding shortfall that is in excess of $1 billion. I will get into that \nin a moment.\n  What I have in my mind right now is about 5 days ago, I spent 2\\1/2\\ \nhours with 12 veterans, men and women who had come back from Iraq, one \nfrom Afghanistan--one several years ago, most of them within the last \nseveral months. They had sustained wounds and had healed some of those \nphysical wounds. But what was particularly stunning to me was the \ndegree of the psychological wounds, self-defined by them, after a \nperiod of relaxing. It takes time for veterans to open up when somebody \nwith a dark suit and tie walks into their little circle. But they began \nto talk about their problems. They would not talk about what they had \ndone because veterans do not do that. World War II veterans do not do \nthat, Vietnam veterans do not do that, Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans \ndo not do that. They talk about what hurts, the uncontrollable \nviolence. They talk about deep depression. They talk about having no \nsense of the future. They talk about problems with their not being able \nto communicate with their wives--all kinds of problems.\n  These were mostly guardsmen and reservists, but there were some \nregular military. They were assembled at the Beckley, WV, Vet Center. I \nsort of point that out because one of the secrets of treating veterans \nin rural areas is you have to have Vet Centers near where veterans are. \nThey can't all be expected to make long journeys to distant major \nveterans hospitals.\n  These folks at the Beckley Vet Center and other Vet Centers are about \nto be overwhelmed. They are going to be more overwhelmed when the other \n130,000 soldiers return home whenever they do. And of course some \nsoldiers will be returning to combat.\n  These soldiers had a very harsh and harrowing series of experiences \nserving their country. Once discharged, they still faced problems. They \ntalked about difficulties in getting reimbursed. They all talked about \nVA appointments being put off for a long time.\n  As I indicated, they were reluctant to talk at all. But when they did \ntalk, they made you very proud when they told you what they felt, not \nnecessarily what they had been through, which they usually decline to \ndo.\n  When our country called upon these brave West Virginians--and that \nwould apply to each and every State--to serve, they answered the call \nof duty without question. In the case of Guard and Reserve, of course, \nthey are always ready to do that and have to make enormous sacrifices \nto do that, often not being able to hold on to their jobs and retain \nthe benefits which they had.\n  When they come back to West Virginia, they deserve the full care and \nsupport they have earned. Yet again, we just learned that our VA health \ncare is well over $1 billion short on funding this year. This is \noutrageous, and it is shameful. Our veterans earned their VA health \ncare benefits through their distinguished service.\n  They should not be delayed or denied care because of mismanagement at \nVA or OMB over poor budget models. This is where I disagreed a little \nbit with the distinguished chairman of the committee. This is not just \nabout the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. This is not about the fact \nthat he is new on the job. The Veterans' Administration is second only \nto the Pentagon in terms of the number of people who work there. If \nthey were using a 2002 model--and at one point the Secretary said they \nwere using the 2002 model, and then at another point he said the 2003 \nmodel--nevertheless it is a very old model. In 2002, we had not gone to \nwar.\n  All of these months have passed. What was the magic that did not \nhappen where VA or OMB management said, ``gee, if we are going to go to \nwar and we are sending all kinds of troops first to one combat zone in \none nation and then to another combat zone in another nation, and plus \nthere is the war on terrorism, what is going to happen with our \nreturning veterans?'' We have troops deployed all around the world and, \nyet nobody in VA or OMB of figures there is going to be a surge in the \nnumber of veterans we have to take care of so they do not change their \nmodel.\n  Well, I am sorry, I do not care whether the Secretary has been there \nfor 6 years or 6 days, that does not work. It is the VA that has \nprofessionals who have worked there for years who should be able to \nadjust those models. That is no excuse whatsoever.\n  Yesterday, Secretary Nicholson testified that the VA had to borrow \nmoney for current accounts to cover immediate health care needs for \nthis year, this year being 2005. Such borrowing would create at least a \n$1.5 billion shortfall for next year, that being fiscal year 2006. But \nthe $1.5 billion is really at least $1.9 billion. We are not actually \ngoing to vote on either of those numbers. I sort of wish we were \nbecause of something which is not brought out but which I am going to \nbring out. The VA assumes the President's VA budget, which includes at \nleast $400 million in health fees, will be collected from the \nveterans--what? Wait a second.\n  Yes, the VA Secretary is still seeking to double the co-payments for \nprescription drugs for veterans, and he is still supporting an \nenrollment fee of at least $250 for some veterans. So, yes, there is a \nshortfall, but then there is income VA expects but won't be collected, \nthe shortfall will be larger. I think that requires a very sharp \nanalysis on the part of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.\n  This Senator opposes such fees. I do not understand how that is done. \nHow does one take somebody who gives up their job potentially, for \nexample a National Guard member who works for the 130th Air Guard wing \nin Charleston, WV, which has complete control over the evacuation of \nthe National Capital area, and then charge them for being able to get \nhealth care after they serve in combat? That is not what Abraham \nLincoln wrote over the Veterans' Administration building.\n  So the VA budget is at least $1.9 billion short. Let that be \nunderstood by my colleagues. Our Members have not been told that \namount, but that is because of the $400 million that VA assumes, but \nCongress never tries to charge our veterans. We should understand that. \nIt is at least $1.9 billion if we fully respond to the health needs of \nreturning veterans.\n  I expect, frankly, it will be more than $1.9 billion. In fact, I \nwould say to the good Senator from the State of Washington that we \ndiscussed higher figures in our Veterans Affairs' Committee meeting.\n  Experts who I immediately reject, because I reject their theory on \nthis,\n\n[[Page S7579]]\n\nsuggest that up to 40 percent of our veterans will have psychological \nwounds such as PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder. I have yet to meet \nwith a single group of veterans who would put the figure at anything \nless than 60 or 70 percent, and that is just post-traumatic stress \ndisorder. We are also talking about depression. We are talking about \nschizophrenia. We are talking about uncontrollable violence. We are \ntalking about rage. We are talking about nightmares. We are talking \nabout people waking up sweating and screaming. This goes all the way \nback to World War I, the science now proves.\n  These West Virginia veterans who typify veterans from around the \ncountry return from Baghdad and Afghanistan, and they describe the \nexperiences of their colleagues, and I truly fear that VA mental health \ncare is going to cost a whole lot more than the two amendments that we \nwill both be voting on and voting for, I hope, this afternoon. My view \nis that whatever the needs of our returning veterans are, they must be \nmet, particular right now during a time of war.\n  Finally, I am personally stunned by the fact that the \nadministration's budget experts and managers use these old models, and \ndid not warn or advise Congress until now. I will go right back to \nthat, their models did not fully estimate the effect of the war on VA \nhealth care spending. Again, blaming a poor old model from 2002 or 2003 \ndoes not cut it in anybody's book. It is unsustainable as an argument. \nAs I say, the VA is second only to the Pentagon in the number of people \nit has. A lot of those folks work on budgets. They know what models \nare. They can come up with new models. They did not come up with new \nmodels, and that is the point. Each time this year, VA officials have \ntestified they were confident of sufficient VA funding. That is what \nthey told the committee in February, in March and in April. They were \ndead wrong. It is stunning. It is sad.\n  So we asked over and over whether they were prepared for the \nreturning troops, and we were told mission accomplished; they had \neverything under control. Again, they were wrong. Our soldiers are \nreturning home and expecting the VA health care they were promised. \nThey are not going to be able to get it. The budget shortfall is \nunconscionable, and our troops deserve better. We must pass this \namendment or any other amendments which raise this amendment. It will \nstill not be enough money, and it will only take care of the present \nsituation that we are in. We must ensure that such a significant \nshortfall never--and I rarely say never''--happens again.\n  I am committed to fighting for our veterans. I believe that is the \nduty of the Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to start by thanking Senator \nMurray and Senator Byrd for working tirelessly with me to try and find \na solution to the VA budget crisis that faces our Nation's veterans. I \nvery much appreciate their leadership on this issue.\n  During the emergency supplemental under Senator Murray's leadership \nwe brought this issue before the body and warned of the impending \ncrisis.\n  As we all know, at that point Secretary Nicholson sent a letter to \nChairman Hutchison stating that ``I can assure you that VA does not \nneed emergency supplemental funds in fiscal year 2005 to continue to \nprovide the timely, quality service that is always our goal.''\n  We now know this is not the case. Yesterday, Secretary Nicholson \ntestified before the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee and acknowledged \nthat in fact the VA is at least $1 billion short this year in veterans' \nmedical care.\n  The VA is resorting to shifting funds from capital accounts as well \nas spending money budgeted as carry over for next year to make up the \nshortfall. Additionally, the Secretary stated that the VA budget \nrequest for next year is short by at least $1.5 billion.\n  As I have always stated, the care for our veterans should never get \ntangled up in partisan gamesmanship. This is why we have been working \nhard with our Republican colleagues to find a solution to this problem.\n  I am pleased that the modifying amendment would add an additional $80 \nmillion to help shore up this year's budget problems at the VA, and I \ncommend Senator Hutchison, my chairman on the Military Construction and \nVeterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, for her leadership and \ncommitment to the needs of America's veterans.\n  However, let us not forget that while the emergency funds that I hope \nwe will pass today helps solve the problem for this year, Secretary \nNicholson testified yesterday that the budget request for next year is \ninsufficient as well.\n  I am hopeful that the administration will take the necessary steps to \ntransmit to the Congress an amended budget which provides an accurate \nestimate of the VA's needs for fiscal year 2006, and a realistic \nblueprint for meeting those needs.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Hutchison, Senator Cochran, \nSenator Byrd and my other colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to \nmake sure that we provide sufficient funding in 2006 to keep the VA \nfrom being awash in red ink again next year.\n  Let me close by again thanking Senator Murray and Senator Byrd. Their \nleadership has been instrumental in helping to solve this problem.\n  I also want to thank Senator Hutchison and Senator Craig for working \nhard with us to try and ensure that veterans receive the care they \nneed.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, Less than 3 months ago, Congress was \ninformed that the Department of Veterans Affairs would not require \nemergency appropriations for the current fiscal year. The Senate acted \naccordingly in supporting the existing appropriation. In the past week, \nwe have been informed that the VA now faces a budget shortfall of \napproximately $1 billion.\n  Many of my colleagues are today discussing how we got here, and where \nthe fiscal projections went wrong. The failure to consider the needs of \nreturning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan in forecasting \nexpenditures demonstrates a critical and inexcusable deficit in \nplanning. Some suggest a new means of budgeting the VA. These are vital \nissues and they will undoubtedly be discussed as in the context of \nfuture appropriations. However, what is most critical today is \naddressing the immediate and pressing needs of our veterans. We simply \nmust maintain our commitment to those who have given so much in their \nservice to our country.\n  Secretary Nicholson had told us that the current budget shortfall \nwould be made up in two ways. The first would be to use approximately \n$600 million from maintenance and capital expenditure accounts, \nredirecting approximately half of such moneys to operating expenses. \nAccording to the Secretary, new construction would not be affected. Yet \nthat leaves undone many pressing projects such as critical repairs and \nrenovations. In many cases, these projects cannot be wisely deferred. \nThe second means of addressing the shortfall would be to use \napproximately $400 million from a carryover account. This approach \nsimply depletes resources and digs a deeper hole for the Department in \nthe next fiscal year.\n  The answer to this problem does not lie in amplifying the shortfall \nin this fiscal year. We do not undertake emergency appropriations \nlightly, but we simply cannot deplete resources, and fail to properly \nbudget for the needs of veterans. Those who have served us in the past, \nand those who continue to serve today, must know that VA services will \nnot be disrupted. Thus I join my colleagues in supporting an emergency \nappropriation for the Department of Veterans Affairs to ensure that our \nveterans shall receive the timely services and support which they so \ndeserve.\n  The Department faces great challenges. As our veterans grow older, \ntheir health care needs increase. The VA faces the same challenges in \nmanaging health care costs which all of America faces, yet anyone who \nhas met a veteran with a service-connected injury or disability \nunderstands the many additional needs which we must meet, especially in \nlight of the service of millions have given this country. Even today, \nas over 130,000 stand in areas of conflict to promote liberty for \nothers, we must make clear that we will always stand by them, today, \nand tomorrow.\n\n[[Page S7580]]\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Hutchison, \nSenator Craig, and others to offer this amendment responding to new \ninformation about shortfalls in the fiscal 2005 budget for the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs.\n  Naturally, every Member of this body is distressed to learn that the \nDepartment is in these fiscal straits and that the Department has made \nthe extent of the problem clear at this date late in the fiscal year.\n  I am pleased that the Appropriations and Veterans Affairs Committees \nhave moved so quickly to pursue the oversight we now urgently need to \ndetermine: 1. How this could have occurred, and 2. what Congress and \nthe VA will need to do differently to ensure that we do not confront \nshortfalls of this nature next year and thereafter.\n  But today, we will accomplish the even more urgent work of ensuring \nthat the necessary funds--$1.5 billion--are available on an emergency \nbasis for the current fiscal year so that there is absolutely no \ndeterioration in the quality of services and facilities for our \nveterans.\n  I suppose it is inevitable that everything sooner or later becomes \nthe subject of partisan dispute in Washington, DC, but it is \ndisappointing that some have seen fit to make support for our veterans \na partisan weapon.\n  I hope the action we take today will go some distance toward \ndemonstrating that the irresistible temptation some feel to try to take \npartisan advantage notwithstanding and that Congress stands united in \nsupport of those who have served and sacrificed.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will be necessarily absent for the later \npart of the day as I will be attending the Oath of Office Ceremony at \nthe United States Naval Academy where my son is being sworn in as a \nmidshipman.\n  I want to express my strong support for the two amendments that will \nbe voted on today to address the unexpected and unacceptable funding \nshortfall for Veterans Administration medical services. I strongly \nendorse the two amendments that I am confident will be adopted \noverwhelmingly. It is incumbent on the Congress and the administration \nto continue to monitor the VA's funding situation closely and ensure \nproper medical assistance is readily available to our deserving \nveterans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, first I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I believe we are out of speakers, and we \nare prepared to yield back time. So I would yield to the Senator from \nNevada, who I guess will wrap up debate, and then we can move on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much time do we have remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 minutes 29 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield to the Senator from Nevada. I believe the \nSenator from Colorado will be here for a couple of minutes. I will use \nthe last 2, and we will be done on our side.\n  I yield to the minority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                 President Bush's Address to the Nation\n\n  Mr. REID. If the Presiding Officer would alert me when I have used 9 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would be happy to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, like many Americans, I listened carefully to \nthe President's Iraq speech last night. As I said in a letter to him \nyesterday prior to his speech, his address to the Nation afforded him \nan excellent opportunity to present to the American people his plan for \nsuccess, to discuss the costs and sacrifices that will be required in \nthe days ahead, and to assure our troops, active and retired, that he \nis committed to doing everything he possibly can to see that they get \nthe services they have earned.\n  Unfortunately, I believe the President's address fell short on all of \nthose accounts, and I will have more to say in the days and weeks ahead \nabout the speech and the path forward in Iraq. But having said this, \nthere is one part of the President's address that bears directly on my \nletter and the matters before the Senate right now. At the end of his \nspeech, the President called on Americans to find a way to thank the \nmen and women defending our freedom by flying a flag, sending letters \nto our troops in the field, helping the military families down the \nstreet, or going to the new Defense Department Web site. I think we owe \nthe men and women in uniform--of course we owe them flying flags, \nmailing letters, and logging on to this new DOD Web site, but we owe \nthem far more than that.\n  I share and support the sentiment and will continue to make sure we \nrecognize the services and sacrifices of our military personnel and \ntheir families. Although the President chose not to mention our \nveterans in his address last night, as I suggested, I believe we have \nan equally solemn obligation--I choose that word purposely--to \nrecognize their sacrifices and to thank them for their willingness to \ndefend our freedom. The amendments before us give us the opportunity to \ndo just that.\n  Just as the obligation is clear, so is the need. At the start of the \nyear, we knew that over 130,000 troops had returned home from Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Analysts told us to expect that an additional 150,000 \nsoldiers, sailors, and airmen would return in the months ahead. That is \nwhy in January and February Democrats, led by Senators Murray and Byrd, \nwarned that the war in Iraq and the war on terror were generating \nhundreds of thousands of new veterans who would soon swamp the existing \ncapacity of the VA health care system.\n  The Senator from Washington said this over and over again. She called \nme during her campaign last October and indicated there was a problem. \nAfter the election, she was concerned about the veterans, and we talked \nseveral times about veterans. So I applaud and commend the Senator from \nWashington for being so deliberate, so consistent and persistent in \nthese efforts.\n  In addition to that, we were warned that many of the soldiers had \nsuffered traumatic injuries that would require extended and intensive \ncare. When I say this, my mind goes back to last Thanksgiving when I \nwent to Bethesda and visited marines who had returned home with missing \nlimbs, some who had been damaged in other ways. But before I left they \nasked me to go into the intensive care ward, and that is something that \nI will never, ever forget, the pictures of those men. Thank goodness I \ndid not see any women. It would have been even more traumatic for me, I \nam sorry to say. I still feel that. I could see my little daughter \nthere, which I did not--but it was very bad, terrible head injuries.\n  We had all these warnings, Democrats and independent veterans groups, \nto conclude that the veterans health care system was massively \nunderfunded and unless drastic steps were taken immediately, tens of \nthousands of veterans, men and women, would be denied access to the \nhealth care this Nation owes them. Unfortunately, the Republicans \nresponded by denying a problem existed. The Senate addressed issues \nthat do not make a difference to most Americans. We worked for almost 2 \nmonths on something called the nuclear option, which was a way to try \nto help five people the President wanted to be judges. Other matters \nwere just put to the side. Of course, this administration has wasted \nday after day, week after week, month after month talking about \nprivatizing Social Security, but a problem does exist, and instead of \ntalking about those issues, we should have been talking about veterans \nhealth care.\n  Keep in mind, the majority defeated Democratic efforts to provide our \nveterans the health care and resources they so clearly and desperately \nneeded. At a time when hundreds of thousands of veterans were returning \nhome in need of health care, the Bush administration submitted a budget \nrequest in February that did not contain a single dollar in additional \nresources to care for the newest generation of veterans. The \nadministration budget was so out of step with reality that the head of \nthe VFW, Veterans of Foreign Wars, called it shameful. That is a quote, \n``shameful.''\n  The national commander of AMVETS called it, ``woefully inadequate.''\n\n[[Page S7581]]\n\n  What did our Republican colleagues in the Senate do with that \nwoefully inadequate and shameful budget? Did they support Democratic \nefforts to support veterans benefits, needed additional benefits? No.\n  Did they support Democratic efforts to increase veterans funding on \nother legislative vehicles? Did they make veterans a top priority of \nthis session of the Congress?\n  The answer to every one of those questions, unfortunately, is no, no, \nno, no. While Senate Republicans found plenty of time to pursue issues \nthat didn't matter, and don't matter, to the American people--I have \nnamed a few. We spent quite a lot of time on a matter that I don't \nthink mattered for most Americans, but some of the things we worked on \nwere intervening in the most private and personal decision a family can \nmake--they found no time for tens of thousands of soldiers who they \nknew were coming home soon to a health care system that lacked \nresources to meet their needs.\n  On three separate occasions this year Senator Murray and Senate \nDemocrats, led by Senator Patty Murray, asked the Senate to vote on \nadditional resources for the veterans health care system. On each \noccasion, Senate Republicans, including the lead sponsor of one of the \namendments we will soon vote on, voted no: ``no'' to add additional \nfunding for our veterans, ``no'' to giving them the quality health care \nthey have earned, ``no'' to keeping our Nation's commitment to those \nwho have served.\n  Three strictly party-line ``no'' votes by the Republicans.\n  The response of the Bush administration was similar and similarly out \nof touch. Rather than acknowledge there was a problem and addressing \nthe concerns raised by Democrats and outside groups, the Bush \nadministration initially chose a path of denial that ultimately \nbordered on outright deceit.\n  In April, after Senator Murray offered an amendment on the emergency \nsupplemental to increase veterans health care funding by $1.9 billion, \nVA Secretary Nicholson--by the way, his qualifications are he was \nchairman of the national Republican Party. He is head of the veterans \nbenefits now--he said:\n\n       I can assure you that the VA does not need emergency \n     supplemental funds in fiscal year 2005 to continue to provide \n     the timely, quality service that is always our goal. . . . I \n     do not foresee any challenges. . . .\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 9 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I will use leader time now for the rest of my remarks.\n  Continuing with Mr. Nicholson:\n\n       I do not foresee any challenges that are not solvable with \n     our own management decision capability.\n\n  The concerns raised by this head-in-the-sand statement were greatly \nexacerbated yesterday. At a hearing before the Senate Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, Veterans Affairs officials from the Bush administration made \ntwo astonishing admissions. First, Mr. Nicholson acknowledged that \nfunding for veterans health care programs is short by at least $2.6 \nbillion because the administration dramatically underestimated the \nnumber of military personnel returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. This \nis the latest example of how poorly the administration planned for and \nprepared this Nation for what would be required in Iraq and the war on \nterror.\n  Second, and even more troubling, VA Under Secretary Perlin testified \nto Congress that at the same time Secretary Nicholson was assuring \nCongress no additional resources were needed, the VA was already \ndipping into reserve funds to meet its operational needs. And Secretary \nNicholson admitted that a management decision had been made in early \nApril--that is why I called what he said before ``deceitful''--made in \nearly April to also dip into capital funds to keep veterans health care \noperations going.\n  What does this mean? Taking away from capital projects, hospitals \nthat need to be renovated and repaired, outpatient clinics that need to \nbe rebuilt. They were dipping into those funds when he was before \ncompetent committees of this Congress not telling the truth, misleading \nus, being deceitful.\n  Think about this for just a bit. The administration sends hundreds of \nthousands of men and women, our troops, abroad to fight in Iraq and \nelsewhere but says it didn't expect they would return home and need \nhealth care services? The administration then fails to provide any \nadditional funds to address the health care needs of these soldiers \nand, when pushed by Democrats, tells Congress no additional funds are \nneeded. And in the final act, the administration acknowledges that the \nvery time it was insisting no additional funds were needed, the VA was \ntapping into reserve funds, and the VA Secretary had decided to pay for \nday-to-day health care expenses by dipping into capital funds, which \nwould severely impact medical facilities across our whole country--\nincluding, I might say, a major medical center that is needed in the \nmost rapidly growing veterans population of any place in America, in \nLas Vegas, NV. Quite a performance.\n  Fortunately, today the Senate has a new day before it. At long last, \nwe have the administration and Senate Republicans acknowledging there \nis a problem. And at long last, Senate Republicans are now willing to \njoin Senate Democrats to do something about it. Although Republican \nsupport for our veterans has been long in coming, I welcome the 11th-\nhour conversion. While the needs of our veterans were not enough to get \nthe attention of some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, \napparently the 2006 elections are.\n  Regardless of their motivation, we welcome their support. I only hope \nthe administration and Senate Republicans remain willing and eager to \njoin with us in the future to ensure that our troops--active and \nretired--and their families, receive the respect and recognition they \ndeserve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thought my comments on this issue had \nconcluded, but I feel the statements just made by the Democratic leader \ndeserve some response.\n  I will work very hard to sustain a calm tone and a bipartisan tone, \nas has been the character of the debate on this issue up until just a \nfew moments ago when it took a dramatically partisan tone, tuned to the \nNovember 2006 elections. To me, that is disappointing, at best, and it \nis, at best, very misdirected.\n  To suggest that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs is only a party \nchairman means that that minority leader has not even read his bio, nor \ndoes he care to. So let me suggest that this Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs is a 1961 graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, \nhe served 8 years on active duty as a paratrooper and Ranger-qualified \nArmy officer, then 22 years in the Army Reserves. While he was in the \nArmy Reserves, he finished his master's degree at Columbia University \nin New York City and his law degree at Denver University.\n  It means that you have to be highly qualified to be ``just'' a party \nchairman.\n  No, I am sorry, Democratic leader. This Secretary is highly qualified \nto be Secretary.\n  I am disappointed, at best, and I hope my colleagues will join with \nme in an overwhelming disappointment at a dramatically partisan \nstatement at a time when this chairman has worked in good faith to be \nextremely bipartisan to resolve a problem.\n  The minority leader forgets that every year during the Clinton \nadministration they proposed to underfund the Veterans Affairs and \nVeterans' Administration and we, in a bipartisan way, said ``no.'' And \nevery year since then, in the Bush administration, they funded it less \nthan the Congress did. And we said ``no,'' because we expected a higher \nlevel of service than the budget crunchers down at OMB would admit; \nDemocrats and Republicans, that is the fact that the minority leader \nhas forgotten for the purpose of partisan politics.\n  Minority Leader Reid, I am highly disappointed. I will step back from \nthe level of anger. You have impugned the integrity of a brave \nAmerican, who is serving as Secretary of our Veterans' Administration, \nand you have impugned my integrity as a Senator, and I am disappointed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time is left?\n\n[[Page S7582]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes and fifty seconds.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Colorado is here and would like to make \na statement. I ask if he could use 3 minutes, and I can use the \nremaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, let me at the outset say that the problem \nwe are trying to deal with in the Senate is a matter of great \nimportance to our veterans. Let me also say I believe the Senate \nVeterans' Affairs Committee has jumped on this problem to try to figure \nout a way that we can move forward. I think the most important response \nto this kind of crisis, where we are leaving so many veterans out of \nthe fold in America, given the kind of shortfall we are seeing in \nhealth care, is that we acknowledge a problem, first of all; and, \nsecond of all, once having acknowledged the problem, that we move to \nfix the problem; and then, third, that we make sure that the problem \ndoes not happen again.\n  What we are doing with today's amendment sponsored by Senator Murray \nand Senator Byrd is fixing the problem for this year so we are able to \nprovide the health care services to which our veterans are entitled. It \nis not good enough for us to support our troops in Iraq, as we all \nshould. It is also necessary--mandatory--for us to make sure that when \nour troops return from Iraq or Afghanistan, we take care of them here \nat home.\n  The Veterans' Administration and the budgets that they have proposed \nhave failed to do that because of the chronic underfunding that they \nhave put on the table. If you analyze the underfunding we are looking \nat today, we potentially could be looking at a cut to veterans health \nservices of somewhere between 10 percent and 15 percent. This is a \nproblem which we need to address as a Congress for the years ahead as \nwell.\n  This amendment that Senator Murray and Senator Byrd have put forward \nis a step in the right direction because it will help us fix a problem \nfor this year. I am a proud cosponsor of that amendment. I believe both \nSenator Byrd and Senator Murray have done the right thing. I applaud \nSenator Murray's leadership in the committee to raise this issue to the \nattention of Senator Craig and the rest of the members of that \ncommittee.\n\n  But it is also very important that the Veterans' Administration, \nthrough Veterans Health, helps us figure out a way of avoiding this \nproblem in the future. We should not let our soldiers from Iraq and \nAfghanistan down, and the only way we can do that is if we fix the \nfunding formulas and fix the assumptions that are currently made.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized. She \nhas 2 minutes and 15 seconds.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as we wind up the debate, it would be \neasy for me to stand here on the floor of the Senate--after months of \nsaying we need to address this issue, we need an emergency supplemental \nand we are finally here--to say I told you so. But that is not how I \nfeel right now.\n  What I am thinking about at this point is my own father, who was a \nveteran of World War II, one of the first soldiers into Okinawa, who \nwas injured, sent to Hawaii, was in the hospital there for 3 months, \nand he went back to serve in Okinawa again and then was in a wheelchair \nfor most of my life before he passed away.\n  I am thinking of the men and women in the veterans' hospital in \nSeattle WA, back in 1972 when I was a senior in college and I \nvolunteered at the veterans' hospital there during the Vietnam war, \nworking on the psychiatric ward with young men and women my age who \nwere returning from Vietnam and understanding what they were going \nthrough, and then going back onto the street and the public not aware \nof the sacrifice of these soldiers.\n  I am thinking of the young men and women I recently met in Iraq \nserving us today, who were asking us: Will my country be there for me?\n  I can assure you none of those soldiers were saying: Will the \nRepublicans be there for me? Will the Democrats be there for me? They \nwere asking: Will we, as Americans, be there for them? With Democrats \nand Republicans alike just about to vote for this amendment--that will \nmake the underlying amendment $1.5 billion with the amendment of the \nSenator from Pennsylvania--what we can say is that this Senate stands \nin full support of our soldiers, from previous conflicts as well as the \nones who are serving us today. I think that is a powerful message and \none of which I am very proud.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington \nagain, as I did earlier, for her work. I thank her also for the tone \nand for the way she presented her case. I think it would express the \nconcern and frustration on both sides of the aisle about the problems \nwe are confronting and have confronted for many years in providing \nadequate funding through administration after administration--at least \nthree I am aware of, three administrations I am aware of where the \nadministration has not properly funded veterans' health care in \nparticular. The Congress has always had to come and add more money. \nThis is nothing new. What is new in this case is that we have had to \ncome at a late time and add additional resources. I think it is \nunfortunate.\n  As I said earlier, I was very critical of this administration for not \nbeing more forthright and felt, as the Senator from Idaho suggested, \nthat when we cast our votes against the Murray amendment, we did so not \nwith the information we needed. The administration, justifiably, should \nbe criticized for that.\n  Unfortunately, the tone the Senator from Nevada took, the Democrat \nleader, was not one of frustration that all were sharing but simply an \nattempt to launch into a partisan attack which, given the nature and \ntenor of what we have been working on, was very unfortunate. One of the \nmost unfortunate comments, which I hope the Senator from Nevada will \nthink better of and come back and correct the record, was to suggest \nthat ``the only qualifications of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs is \nthat he was chairman of the Republican National Committee'' is an \ninsult to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and his service to this \ncountry.\n  This is a man who is a West Point graduate who served 8 years in \nactive military and served tours in Vietnam. He earned the Bronze Star. \nHe earned the Combat Infantryman Badge, the Meritorious Service Medal, \nand two Air Medals. This is not a man whose only qualification was he \nwas chairman of the RNC. He went on and served in the Reserves for 20 \nyears, earned additional degrees, ran and started a business, and was \nambassador to the Holy See. This man has a lot more qualifications as \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs than many prior Secretaries. I hope the \nSenator from Nevada would reconsider his shot at this Secretary.\n  Do I have concerns about the information provided? Absolutely. Does \nthe Secretary have to come and have an accounting for what he said and \nwhat he did in his short term now as Secretary? Absolutely. Has he been \ncalled on the carpet in both the House and Senate? Absolutely. Will he \nbe over the next few months? Absolutely. But to take a shot at him \npersonally in such a partisan fashion is beneath the leader of the \nDemocrat Party. I hope the leader of the Democrat Party would show some \nleadership in civility when it comes to addressing people who have \nserved this country honorably and continue to do their best.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time and ask the votes on the \nSantorum and Murray amendments be stacked sequentially at a time so \ndesignated by the leaders.\n  I ask that Senator Snowe be added as a cosponsor to the Santorum \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask that Senator Corzine be added as a cosponsor to \nthe Murray amendment, as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. We will shortly vote on the Santorum amendment, then the \nMurray amendment, as amended. I urge all of my colleagues to support \nboth amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Those votes will occur at a time to be \nascertained.\n\n[[Page S7583]]\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1059\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is the next order of \nbusiness would be my amendment numbered 1059, and there is 10 minutes \nper side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask to claim as much time as I may \nconsume from the 10 minutes. Perhaps we can move through this rather \nquickly.\n  This relates to an issue I have already spoken to the Senate about on \ntwo occasions. It relates to a soldier named Carlos Lazo. Carlos Lazo \nescaped Cuba on a raft. He tried to escape once and was caught and put \nin prison in Cuba. The second time he escaped on a raft, he got to this \ncountry. His wife and children were not able to get out of Cuba. After \nhe got to this country, he subsequently joined the National Guard, and \nwent to Iraq on behalf of this country to fight in Iraq. Sergeant Lazo \nreceived the Bronze Star for from his country for courage and bravery \nin fighting in Iraq. He is now back in the U.S. from his service in \nIraq.\n  He has a son who has been quite ill in Cuba, so he wanted to go see \nhis sick son in Cuba. His Government, the U.S. Government, the \nGovernment that he served by going to fight for freedom in Iraq, said: \nNo, you are not free to travel to Cuba to see your son. Why is that the \ncase? Because the President of the United States has created a new \nregulation, and the regulation says you can only travel to Cuba once \nevery 3 years.\n  So this soldier, the soldier that wins the Bronze Star fighting for \nthis country in Iraq, is told he can't go to see his sick son because \nhe does not have the freedom to do that. He visited me and asked me \nabout it. I called Condoleezza Rice. She didn't call back, Bob Zoellick \nher deputy did. I called the Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary Snow. \nHe did not call back. One of his underlings did. I called Karl Rove at \nthe White House. He called back, and later the Chief of Staff's office \ncalled me and said that relative to Karl Rove's call, Bob Zoellick in \nthe State Department would handle it. And I have not heard back from \nhim. We talked once. He said he would call back, and I have not had the \ncall.\n  The question is this, Is there a humanitarian relief exception to the \ntravel ban for someone with a sick kid in Cuba, for a soldier to go see \nhis sick kid? The answer, according to the head of the Office of \nForeign Assets Control at Treasury, which runs this is, no, there is no \nhumanitarian relief. He said: We get calls from people who say my \nmother is going to die in a few days, and we can't give them the \nopportunity to go to Cuba to see them if they have traveled once before \nin the 3-year period.\n  He said: I understand what you are saying, Mr. Senator, but we turn \nthem all down because we must.\n  I said: But you created the regulation. What on Earth are you \nthinking about?\n  This soldier's story--and I have told the story about the woman that \ndistributed free Bibles in Cuba, who gets fined by her Government, the \nU.S. Government, for doing it--this soldier's story begs out and \nscreams for attention by this Congress. So I have offered an amendment \nthat will provide for humanitarian circumstances under which Americans \ncan travel to Cuba to visit or care for a member of the person's family \nwho is seriously ill, injured, or dying; make funeral or burial \narrangements for a member of the individual's family.\n\n  I am just wondering who in this Chamber is going to stand up for this \nsoldier and this soldier's right. It is not just him, it is the others \nwho are applying who say their mother or father or child is dying and \nnow they are now being turned down by the Federal Government because \nthere is no humanitarian exception.\n  This is unforgivable. There ought to be a humanitarian exception. I \nhope my colleagues will stand up for this soldier's rights. He fought \nfor freedom in Iraq and now doesn't have the freedom to see his sick \nson? What can we be thinking about? Why do I need to go further?\n  I have spoken about this issue previously, but Sergeant Lazo \nobviously comes to us because he has a selfish interest. It is in \nseeing his sick son. That is a pretty good selfish interest as far as I \nam concerned. Others have come to me. Joan Slote, who is in her \nmidseventies, took a bicycle trip in Cuba and got fined by her \nGovernment. It is unbelievable what is going on.\n  I come to the Senate today only because I am persuaded from last \nweek's visit with Sergeant Lazo that this ought to stop. This Congress \nought to have the courage to stand up and do what is right. If we don't \nhave the courage to do this, we don't have the courage to object to \nanything the White House does. This came from the White House. This is \nall about politics. This rule that says Americans visit their family in \nCuba only once in three years is all about Florida politics. Everybody \nin this Chamber knows it.\n  This amendment does not overturn the travel rule with Cuba. I happen \nto think people ought to be able to travel to Cuba. I know Fidel Castro \npokes his finger in America's eye. The quicker we get rid of that \nGovernment, the better. But the fact is, we will do that, it seems to \nme, by allowing trade and allowing travel, just as we do with Communist \nChina and Communist Vietnam. But that is not the way this country deals \nwith Cuba because of Florida politics. We have decided that Sergeant \nLazo shall not be allowed to go see his sick child.\n  The question is, Will the Senate, will the men and women in the \nSenate, have the courage and the good sense to cast the right vote and \nsay to Sergeant Lazo and others, If you have a member of your family \nwho is seriously ill, injured, or dying, you have a right to go see \nthem? We will give you the license to do that.\n  We have had vote after vote on these issues. The question today is \nwill we have enough Senators to decide to use a little common sense? If \nyou care about families--a lot of people are talking about profamily \nthese days--if you care about family, if you are profamily, cast the \nright vote. Cast the right vote on this amendment.\n  My understanding is the Senator from Montana will have some time, as \nwell.\n  I reserve my remaining 3 minutes 50 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, the Senator from North Dakota brings up a \ngood point on humanitarian needs. I don't know what the specifics are \nin the case of the sergeant. I have a strong feeling toward the \nsergeant. If he has family, and with the service to his country, I am \nprone to find out why his permission to travel to that country under \nthese circumstances was denied. There must be something out there that \nwe do not know.\n  We have been reluctant in our dealings with Mr. Castro and Cuba. \nEmbargos and this type thing only hurt the people who are the average \ncitizens of a country. I have a feeling for this. However, there is an \nobjection to it. We will have a vote on it. I appreciate the Senator \nfrom North Dakota bringing up this circumstance. We should look into it \nand find out what the circumstance is behind it. There are some more \nmaybe pending that we do not know anything about. Nonetheless, we will \nvote on this amendment.\n\n  Mr. President, I have no more comments on this. I reserve the \nremainder of my time. There was a speaker to come to the floor, and he \nhas not arrived yet, so I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of \nmy time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, Mr. President, if we are going to use the other \ntime for someone who opposes the amendment, I would like to use my \nseveral minutes to close the debate on this amendment. So I ask \nunanimous consent to reserve my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S7584]]\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose Senator Dorgan's attempt \nto waive the rules of the Senate. All of us operate under the \nconstraints of the rules. The rules create a level playing field, \nprovide stability, and bind the Senate together. According to CRS, \nsimilar attempts to waive the rules to legislate on appropriations \nbills have been tried twice since 1989, and failed both times. There is \na good reason why the rules have not been successfully waived in recent \nCongresses. If waiving the rules becomes the practice of the Senate, \njust another tool for Senators, there will be chaos.\n  Many of my colleagues were Senators during times when authorizing on \nappropriations was routine. Do we want to potentially go down this path \nagain? I think not.\n  Is my colleague seeking to waive the rules for a national emergency, \nan emergency in his State, relief from a terrorist attack, or a wartime \nemergency? No. He is seeking to waive the rules of the Senate to \noverturn regulations on travel to Cuba.\n  The regulations targeted by Senator Dorgan's amendment do not \neliminate family travel. They simply limit the amount of times you can \ntravel to Cuba for family visits--once every 3 years; in case of \nnecessity--and limit it to visiting actual direct relatives. There used \nto be a tremendous abuse of people vacationing in Cuba claiming to \nvisit their third uncle on their grandmother's side.\n  According to the State Department, the new regulations, which went \ninto effect in July 2004, have cost the Castro dictatorship up to $375 \nmillion in lost revenue. I believe this is a good thing. Most of the \nmoney from travel, dollar stores, and hotels go directly to Cuba's \nmilitary.\n  Recently, great media attention has been given to the case of SGT \nCarlos Lazo of Spokane, WA, who has two sons in Cuba. It is for cases \nof this nature that U.S. law allows his sons to visit him in the United \nStates on a visitor's visa or to immigrate to the United States.\n  The proper statement for the Senate at this time is to go on record \nto demand that Castro let these boys go so they can see their father. \nI, for one, will do everything possible to see that his sons get here \nand have been assured that our State Department will work to facilitate \nthis. The proper statement for the Senate is not to waive the rules of \nthe Senate to create chaos in this Chamber and let more money go to \nsubsidize Castro's repressive regime.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and yield back the remainder of our \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it will be unbelievable to me if the \nSenate buys this line that somehow waiving the rules creates chaos in \nthe Senate. That must be confusing appealing the ruling of the Chair \nwith waiving the rules. Waiving the rules does not create any chaos. It \nsimply says in this circumstance, with this set of facts, this Senate \nsays that soldier, who fought in Iraq and won a Bronze Star, ought to \nhave the right to see his sick kid. If this Senate cannot find that \ncommon sense, then there is something wrong, something dreadfully \nwrong.\n  So we are told: Well, why don't you have the kids come to the United \nStates. Did you forget the word ``sick''? We have a sick kid here, \namong other things. But this is not about common sense; it is about \npolitics. It is about Florida politics. That is why a new regulation \nwent into effect that replaced the old one. And, by the way, the old \nregulation did have a humanitarian exception. It did have a \ncircumstance where this soldier would have been able to go to Cuba to \nsee his sick son.\n  But when the President made it a new rule, a new regulation--only one \nvisit every 3 years--they eliminated all exemptions. It does not \nmatter. Your mother is dying on Saturday? Tough luck. A real \n``profamily'' stand, as far as I am concerned. It seems to me there \nought to be a humanitarian exception.\n  Look, if I were doing what I wanted here, I would lift the travel \nlimitations completely. I am not doing that. I am providing a \nhumanitarian exemption to say that if a member of your immediate family \nis seriously ill, injured, or dying, you ought to be able to get a \nlicense to go see them 90 miles off the coast of Florida.\n  So if you want to come to the floor and decide we should not do this, \nthen, please, if you don't mind, call Sergeant Lazo tonight--I will \ngive you his telephone number--and tell him why you don't think he has \nthe freedom to see his sick kid. A guy who put on the uniform and \ntraveled halfway around the world to fight for this country does not \nhave the freedom to go see his sick child. There is something \nfundamentally bankrupt with that thought process.\n  If this Senate does not have the backbone to stand up to the White \nHouse on this--and, yes, it is the White House; that is who formed the \nrule, a rule with no exemption at all, no humanitarian exemption--if we \ndo not have the backbone to stand up on this, I probably will not come \nwith another story like this, because if you cannot do it for this \nsoldier, you cannot do it for anybody. But it ought not just be this \nsoldier, it ought to be anybody who has a sick or a dying relative who \nought to have the right to go see them 90 miles off the coast of \nFlorida.\n  This is not rocket science. For all the times that people stand up \nand talk about being compassionate, caring about the individual, \ntalking about freedom, for all of those occasions they talk about being \nprofamily, let's see it. Let's see it manifested on this vote, at this \ntime. Do not vote against this and say: Oh, it had something to do with \nsuspension, it had something to do with this, that, or the other thing.\n  This is simple. You cannot misunderstand this vote: Do you believe \nthis guy ought to have the right to see his sick kid or not? Do you \nbelieve the American people ought to have the right to travel in \ncircumstances where one of their relatives is sick, injured, or dying? \nIf you do not, then vote against my amendment. But if you believe in \nsome common sense here, then, please, support this amendment. Send the \nright message.\n  This does not eliminate the travel ban. It does provide the \nhumanitarian exemption that used to always exist and should exist \nagain.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, we have another speaker coming on our side \nwho is on his way.\n  In the meantime, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I yield \ntime to Senator Kyl for the purpose of withdrawing his amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will support that request, but I want to \nmention to my colleague from Montana that prior to going to the final \nvote, I believe Senator Reid wishes time to speak. So I want to make \nsure that is preserved prior to final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1050 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. President, I first ask unanimous consent to withdraw amendment \nNo. 1050.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me explain briefly what the amendment is, \nand why I filed it, and why we need to deal with that subject matter in \nthe future.\n  I have spoken with Senator Burns about this and have his agreement \nthat he will try to work with us to find a way around the problem that \nthe amendment was designed to resolve. I appreciate his cooperation in \nthat regard.\n  Actually, for several years I have discussed this on the floor. We \nhave had agreements in the past that the authorizing committees would \nwork with us to change the formula for the Clean Water Act. We have not \nbeen able to get that done yet. So I am, once again, noting the fact \nthat under the EPA-funded study to determine the needs of the States--a \nsimilar study which is used under the Clean Water Act--Arizona ranks \n10th in terms of needs in the country, 10th out of all of the States.\n  In terms of the funding provided by the formula under this act, \nArizona\n\n[[Page S7585]]\n\nranks 51st among the 50 States. Now, you may say: 51st? There are only \n50 States. That is right. Actually, Arizona ranks behind Guam and \nPuerto Rico. So here we have one of the fastest growing States, with \nsome of the greatest needs--according to the EPA, 10th in the country \nin needs--and the formula puts Arizona worse than any other State in \nthe Union. That has to be fixed.\n  I believe my colleagues will understand if I say that in Arizona we \ncannot allow this situation to continue any longer. So if my colleagues \ndo not like the formula we have put forward that would resolve this \nissue, then I invite them to come forward with some other kind of \nformula that would resolve the issue. But we are not going to very long \nabide by a situation which has been going on now for years that \ncontinues to put Arizona at the very bottom when our needs rank very \nclose to the top.\n  Again, I appreciate the commitments that have been made by the \ndistinguished chairman, the Senator from Montana, to try to work with \nus to find a way around this. I do appreciate that this is primarily an \nauthorizing problem, so we will be talking to the authorizing chairmen \nas well. My colleagues will hear more about this in the future. In the \nmeantime I have withdrawn the amendment that would fix this. But I hope \nmy colleagues will work with us in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona. There is \na larger problem on the Arizona River. We are all aware of it. It is \ngoing to take a lot of us working together to deal with that river \nbecause of population growth, especially in the wintertime, from Lake \nMead and going south. Arizona is only a little piece of that. But, \nnonetheless, the Senator is very much interested in what happens all \nthe way down, for the simple reason that with Nevada, Arizona, and \nCalifornia, it will take a lot of people working together to deal with \nthat problem. I appreciate the Senator's interest in that, and I do \npledge to work with the Senator on authorization.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1059\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I rise to speak against amendment No. \n1059 which would attempt to change foreign policy toward Cuba in an \nappropriations bill, which I think procedurally, as well as \nsubstantively, is the wrong thing to do. I urge my fellow Senators to \nvote ``no'' on this amendment.\n  The amendment would seek to unconditionally grant a concession to the \nrepressive Castro regime. This is a government and a country that \ncurrently suppresses the human rights of its people. It has been on the \nlist of states that assist terrorism, consistently right there with \nNorth Korea and other countries that are not particularly helpful to \nour global war on terror.\n  Aside from that, this policy of travel consists as one leg or one \npart of a more comprehensive travel policy toward Cuba that the United \nStates put in place under the leadership of our President about a year \nand a half ago. It created some restrictions on travel. It limited \ntravel even among Cuban families.\n  I know this community well. I know it is a policy that is largely \nsupported by that community. I also would tell you that there is, in my \nown life, the knowledge that the denial of family reunification is \nsomething that for over 40 years the Cuban system has utilized as part \nof their endeavor in order to control people.\n  I had lived in this country for 4 years, and during those 4 years of \nseparation from my mother and father--between the ages of 15 and 19--my \nfamily was not able to travel here to visit me. They were not allowed \nby the Cuban Government to at any point leave Cuba to visit.\n  The case of this brave soldier, whom I greatly respect and honor, Mr. \nLazo, who has served his country bravely in Iraq, has been brought up. \nLet me say, specifically, on that case, this young man, who has sons in \nCuba, wishes to go to Cuba to visit his sons. It is understandable. He \nhas been there in the past 3 years. He wants to go again. His sons are \n16 and 19.\n  We have asked Mr. Lazo if he would allow us to bring his children \nhere so they could visit here. One of them has had some illness. \nCurrently, he is not under medical care, but he has been recently. He \ncould certainly seek medical care here when he came, under his father's \nauspices.\n  In addition to that, I believe it would be a nice thing for these \nchildren to have an opportunity to visit in a free society and a free \ncountry. That request, that offer, has been refused. For family reasons \nor other reasons, he doesn't care to pursue that. He wants to go there. \nI understand that. But I don't believe we can change the foreign policy \nof the United States to suit one individual situation.\n\n  I am sympathetic to family travel. I am sympathetic to humanitarian \nproblems that may arise from time to time in people's families. I have \nlived those in my own family and my own life. However, I believe the \npolicy of the United States, the law of the United States, ought to be \nfollowed and that it would be wrong for us in this instance at this \ntime to change what is established foreign policy of our country, \nestablished in terms of our relationship with Cuba, simply to take care \nof this individual situation. I would like to think of how we might \nwork on a humanitarian travel policy that might even include Cuba \nmaking concessions but that it would not be a unilateral concession to \nthis tyrannical government.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, all time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BURNS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1046\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, we have accepted amendment No. 1046 on both \nsides. I ask unanimous consent that amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1046) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Tennessee, Mr. Alexander, the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Carper, \nand the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Santorum, be added as cosponsors \nto amendment No. 1046.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to the \nmanagers of the legislation for accepting this amendment. The amendment \nprovides for a study of the feasibility of designating the Captain John \nSmith Chesapeake National Historic Watertrail as a national historic \ntrail. I was joined in this by my able colleague, Senator Mikulski, and \nby the two Virginia Senators, Mr. Warner and Mr. Allen.\n  The year 2007--less than 2 years from now--marks the 400th \nAnniversary of the Founding of Jamestown, the first permanent English \nsettlement in America.\n  The critical role that Captain John Smith played in the founding of \nJamestown and in exploring the Chesapeake Bay region during the years \n1607 to 1609 was a defining period in the history of our Nation. His \ncontemporaries and historians alike, credit Smith's strong leadership \nwith ensuring the survival of the fledgling colony and laying the \nfoundation for the future establishment of our Nation.\n  With a dozen men in a 30-foot open boat, Smith's expeditions in \nsearch of food for the new colony and the fabled Northwest Passage took \nhim nearly 3,000 miles around the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries \nfrom the Virginia capes to the mouth of the Susquehanna. On his voyages \nand as President of the Jamestown Colony, Captain Smith became the \nfirst point of contact for scores of Native American leaders from \naround the Bay region. His relationship with Pocahontas is now an \nimportant part of American\n\n[[Page S7586]]\n\nfolklore. Smith's notes describing the indigenous people he met and the \nChesapeake Bay ecosystem are still widely studied by historians, \nenvironmental scientists, and anthropologists.\n  The remarkably accurate maps and charts that Smith made of his \nvoyages into the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries served as the \ndefinitive map of the region for nearly a century. His voyages, as \nchronicled in his journals, ignited the imagination of the Old World, \nand helped launch an era of adventure and discovery in the New World. \nHundreds, and then thousands of people aspired to settle in what Smith \ndescribed as one of ``. . . the most pleasant places known, for large \nand pleasant navigable rivers, heaven and earth never agreed better to \nframe a place for man's habitation.'' Even today, his vivid \ndescriptions of the Bay's abundance still serve as a benchmark for the \nhealth and productivity of the Bay.\n  With the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown quickly \napproaching, the designation of this route as a national historic trail \nwould be a tremendous way to celebrate an important part of our \nNation's story and serve as a reminder of John Smith's role in \nestablishing the colony and opening the way for later settlements in \nthe New World. It would also give recognition to the Native American \nsettlements, culture and natural history of the 17th-century \nChesapeake. Similar in historic importance to the Lewis and Clark \nNational Trail, this new historic watertrail will inspire generations \nof Americans and visitors to follow Smith's journeys, to learn about \nthe roots of our nation and to better understand the contributions of \nthe Native Americans who lived within the Bay region.\n  Equally important, the Captain John Smith Chesapeake National \nWatertrail can serve as a national outdoor resource by providing rich \nopportunities for education, recreation, and heritage tourism not only \nfor more than 16 millions Americans living in the Bay's watershed, but \nfor visitors to this area. The water trail would be the first National \nWatertrail established in the United States and would allow voyagers in \nsmall boats, cruising boats, kayaks and canoes to travel from the \ndistant headwaters to the open Bay--an accomplishment that would \ninspire today's explorers and would generate national and international \nattention and participation. The Trail would complement the Chesapeake \nBay Gateways and Watertrails Initiative and help highlight the Bay's \nremarkable maritime history, its unique watermen and their culture, the \ndiversity of its peoples, its historical settlements and our current \nefforts to restore and sustain the world's most productive estuary.\n\n  This proposed trail enjoys bipartisan support in the Congress and in \nthe States through which the trail passes. The proposed trail has been \nendorsed by the Governors of Virginia, Pennsylvania, Delaware and \nMaryland. The measure is also strongly supported by The Conservation \nFund, Izaak Walton League, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and the \nChesapeake Bay Commission.\n  But designating a new National Historic Trail is essentially a two-\nstep process. First, Congress must authorize the Department of Interior \nto undertake a study of the national historic significance of the \nproposed trail and the feasibility of designating such a trail. \nNational Historic Trails must meet 3 criteria: they must be nationally \nsignificant; have a documented route through maps or journals; and \nprovide for recreational opportunities. Once the study is complete--\nusually a 3-year process that involves public hearings and input--a \nrecommendation is submitted to the Secretary of Interior to designate \nthe trail and Congress must enact legislation to authorize the trail.\n  We hope to make up some of the time by the work that is already \nunderway by public and private sector organizations to document the \nhistory of Jamestown and John Smith's travels.\n  However, unless we can get this provision enacted shortly, the Park \nService will be unable to complete the study and make recommendations \non the proposed trail in conjunction with that anniversary.\n  Mr. President, we hope to get this study done before the Jamestown \ncelebrations. In 2007, they are scheduled for celebrations at \nJamestown. It will be a big national event. The Captain John Smith \nWatertrail is obviously very much connected to the Jamestown \nsettlement. It involves, of course, the Chesapeake Bay. We are very \nhopeful this study will prove the feasibility of designating this water \ntrail. I am pleased to join with my colleagues in putting this idea \nforward. Again, I thank the managers of the legislation for accepting \nthe amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may I commend my distinguished colleague \nfrom Maryland and Senator Mikulski and others. The two Virginians and \nthe two Marylanders have joined together, and it is a very important \nstep to be taken in connection with a national commitment to the \nrecognition of the Jamestown period.\n  I wish we could in some way reduce this for the record, but we simply \ncan't do it. There is an excellent review in the National Geographic of \nJune of this year, on the whole area. It is something that I think an \ninordinate number of Americans will be interested in reading about \nbecause it goes to the very roots of the foundation of this great \nNation.\n  I thank the distinguished managers of the bill.\n  Come 2007, we will celebrate the 400th Anniversary of the founding of \nJamestown, the first permanent English settlement in the New World, as \nwell as the heroics of its first leader, Captain John Smith.\n  Lasting from 1607-1609, John Smith's historic 3,000-mile exploration \nof the Chesapeake's main stem and tributaries made him the first \nambassador to the native peoples of the Chesapeake, allowing for the \nexchange of cultural customs and material goods.\n  Along his journey, Smith noted the incredible bounty of the Bay, \nwriting that ``oysters lay thick as stones'' and fish were so prevalent \nyou could catch them ``with frying pans.''\n  What would this trail accomplish? It would allow Americans to retrace \nthe paddle strokes and footsteps of Captain Smith, to gain a better \nunderstanding of the perils he and his fellow settlers faced during the \nvoyages they took to better understand the New World.\n  Ultimately, this proposed trail seeks to celebrate Captain Smith's \nforesight, the founding steps of America, and the bounty of the \nChesapeake Bay. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nfeasibility study for the Captain John Smith Chesapeake National \nHistoric Watertrail.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, we are ready to move. I would call for the \nregular order under the previous order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Parliamentary inquiry: Was the amendment agreed to?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to a series of stacked votes in relation to the amendments in \nthe order they were offered, to be followed by third reading and a vote \non passage of the bill as provided under the previous order. I also ask \nunanimous consent that there be 2 minutes between each vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the Murray amendment.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are about to vote on the Murray \namendment, as amended. I remind all of our colleagues, this has been a \nlong road in coming to get to the point today where we stand as a \nunited body to make sure we provide the funds for our veterans that are \nneeded in this coming fiscal year.\n  As I said when we ended this debate, this is not a Republican issue; \nthis is not a Democratic issue; this is an American issue. It is the \nright thing to do as we head into the Fourth of July recess to know \nthat we are providing the funds in an emergency supplemental to make \nsure none of our members in the service from prior conflicts or the \nwars today who are coming home will be denied the services they have \nbeen promised.\n  This is a proud moment for the Senate. I want to work with my \ncolleagues now to make sure the House and the White House work with us \nto expeditiously get these funds in place for our veterans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, this is, in a sense, the identical vote \nwe just cast. This is the Murray amendment, as amended by the Santorum-\nHutchison-Craig amendment. I encourage my colleagues to vote for this \namendment.\n  I again thank the Senator from Washington. As we said during the \ndebate, she was right and we got bad information. The Senator from \nIdaho, the Senator from Texas, as well as cooperation on the other side \nof the aisle, have gotten to the bottom of this. We have a lot more \nwork to do.

There is now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the motion of the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, to \nsuspend paragraph 4 of rule XVI to consider his amendment No. 1059.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am not going to belabor the discussion. \nI think all Members understand what this is. This vote will be on \nwhether we decide to provide a humanitarian relief piece in the \nlegislation that otherwise does not allow a soldier--who went to Iraq \nto fight for America's freedom in Iraq, won the Bronze Star, and comes \nback here to have the freedom--to go see a sick child in Cuba. Why? \nBecause there is no humanitarian relief in the regulation that was \npassed by the President.\n  I am not going to go on at great length. I have spoken about this \nthree times. It is not just about this soldier but about others. When I \ncalled down to the Treasury Department, they said: No, there is no \nopportunity for this soldier to go see a sick child. In fact, we have \npeople calling here saying, My mother is going to die on Sunday \naccording to the doctor, and we say, Sorry you can't go. That is the \nregulation. The new regulation says you get one visit in 3 years. If \nyou had that visit, no matter what is happening to your family in Cuba, \nyou can't go. Period. So this young man goes to Iraq, fights for his \ncountry, wins the Bronze Star, and doesn't have the freedom to go see \nhis sick child in Cuba. That is wrong, and everybody in this Chamber \nought to know it.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise to oppose suspending the \nrules to take up the Dorgan amendment to revise rules on family travel \nto Cuba.\n  I have always supported a strong economic embargo against Cuba, as \nwell as a ban on tourist travel to the island. I believe it is in our \nnational interest to keep the pressure on the Cuban dictatorship, and \nnot give Fidel Castro access to resources that make it easier for him \nto oppress the Cuban people.\n  At the same time, how we treat Cuban-Americans during their moments \nof family tragedy reflects on our character as a Nation. We should \nensure that our policy demonstrates compassion for these fellow \ncitizens in their moments of grief. I have many constituents who have \nfaced such wrenching circumstances in their lives.\n  Unfortunately, my colleague from North Dakota is proposing a fairly \nsignificant change in U.S. foreign policy as part of an unrelated \nappropriations bill. In order for us to take up the amendment, the \nSenate would have to vote to suspend its own rules that ban legislating \non an appropriations bill.\n  I am not opposed to a debate about whether our current policies on \nCuban-Americans' ability to travel to see their relatives may be too \nrestrictive and whether they are in need of adjustments. But if we are \nto have such a debate, my colleagues in the Senate deserve enough time \nto consider fully such a major change in U.S. foreign policy. I would \nbe willing to work with my colleagues to try to fashion a proposal that \ncould gain broad support\n\n[[Page S7588]]\n\nand would go through the proper legislative process. But for now, for \nthe reasons I have stated, I must vote not to suspend the rules.\n  Mr. BURNS. Nobody can sum this argument better than the Senator from \nFlorida and the Senator from Nevada. I would say this: This is a change \nin policy and regulation, and we should consider that.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, this about winds up our work.\n  Mr. President, I raise a point of order on the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained. The amendment \nfalls.\n\n\n                           grants management\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, amendment number 1051 concerns the manner \nin which the Environmental Protection Agency awards direct assistance \ngrants. Over the past 10 years, regardless of Presidential \nadministration, the U.S. Government Accountability Office and EPA \nInspector General have been extremely critical of the way EPA awards \nand administers grants programs. As chairman of the Senate Environment \nand Public Works Committee, I have made oversight of EPA grants \nmanagement a Committee priority. Each year, the EPA awards half its \nbudget in grants amounting to over $4 billion. This amount is comprised \nof non-discretionary grants awarded pursuant to regulatory or statutory \nformula for expenditures such as capitalization funding for State and \nlocal programs and comprised of discretionary grants awarded to a \nvariety of recipients. In a hearing before the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee early last year, the Government Accountability Office \nand EPA inspector general offered testimony critical of the lack of \ncompetition in awarding discretionary funds, the lack of measurable \nenvironmental results, and an overall lack of accountability of EPA \npersonnel and grant recipients. More specifically, the GAO testified \nthat due to a lack of competition in grants, EPA can't ensure the most \nqualified applicants receive grant awards. The EPA inspector general \neven testified that due to a lack of competition, there is an \nappearance of preferential treatment in grant awards. On March 31, \n2005, the inspector general released an audit concluding that EPA needs \nto compete more grants and recommended that EPA eliminate \nnoncompetitive justifications for national organizations that represent \nthe interests of State, tribal, and local governments. My amendment \nreflects the inspector general's recommendation and would simply \nrequire open competition to ensure the value of those awards. However, \nthe EPA inspector general's recommendation may be too broad of an \napproach. Perhaps the most important question that can be raised \nconcerning EPA grants is the question, ``What is the benefit to the \nenvironment?'' The EPA has an obligation to ensure taxpayers that it is \naccomplishing its mission of protecting human health and the \nenvironment with the funds it awards each year. My interest is ensuring \nthat EPA direct assistance grants demonstrate environmental value and \nEPA enacts necessary measures to reach that aim. Can I get the \ncommitment from the chairman of the Interior Appropriations \nsubcommittee to work with me to sufficiently address this issue?\n  Mr. BURNS. I appreciate the concerns raised by the chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee and commit to working with him \nto address this issue of importance to him and the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Montana and chairman of the \nInterior Appropriations subcommittee for his commitment to work with me \non this matter of great importance to me, and I congratulate him on a \njob well done with respect to this appropriations bill. With his \ncommitment I will withdraw my amendment 1051 to H.R. 2361.\n\n\n                        TRIBAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, in the Senate Report for the FY 2006 \nInterior and Related Agencies Appropriations bill, S. Rpt. 109-80, \nunder State and Tribal Assistance Grants programs within the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency accounts, one of the line items gives a \ngrant to a town in Oregon called Winchester. It is my understanding \nthat the intended town which is seeking the grant of Federal assistance \nfor water improvements is actually Winchester Bay, OR.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I concur with my colleague and ask through the chair that \nthe managers of this bill fix this small but important typographical \nerror in conference on this bill with the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. BURNS. Yes, we will certainly do that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I concur with my colleague that we will indeed try to fix \nthis conference.\n\n\n               REPLACEMENT OF THE FILENE CENTER MAIN GATE\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I would like to engage the chairman in a colloquy on the \nfacility needs at Wolf Trap National\n\n[[Page S7589]]\n\nPark for the Performing Arts. The President's budget request includes \n$4,285,000 to replace the main gate facility at the Filene Center. This \nproject also includes the replacement of three temporary trailers. The \npurpose of this project is to vastly improve visitor services and \nsecurity at the main gate entrance. These facility improvements are \nseriously needed to replace outdated and inadequate space for park \nemployees, volunteers, park police and visitors. The current \nfacilities, which have been considered ``temporary'' for over 20 years \nare functionally obsolete leaving visitors to wait in long lines for \nrestrooms, and ticketing services.\n  I recognize that the Park Service's construction budget is under \nsignificant financial constraints, but I must emphasize the financial \ncontributions made by the Wolf Trap Foundation to begin the conception \ndesign work of this long-awaited project. I respectfully request that \nthe chairman keep these facts in mind, and ask if he could share with \nthe Senate his views on this important project.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, for his \nsupport for this unique Park Service asset. As the Senator from \nVirginia has indicated, the facilities at the Filene Center's main gate \nare in serious need of replacement to improve employee space and \nvisitor services. The Senator from Virginia has my commitment to ensure \nthat the needs of this facility are fully evaluated as we work with our \ncolleagues in the House of Representatives on the FY 2006 Interior and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations bill.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I engage the Senator from Montana, the \ndistinguished subcommittee Chairman, and the Senator from North Dakota, \nthe distinguished subcommittee ranking member, in a brief colloquy to \nclarify the location of the Forest Service land acquisition project \nlisted as the ``I-90 Corridor'' on page 87 of the committee report.\n  Mr. BURNS. The subcommittee would be happy to assist the Senator in \nthis matter.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The project called ``I-90 Corridor'' is listed in the \ncommittee report as being in the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. \nThe parcels that are designated for acquisition by the Forest Service \nin FY 2006 are actually located in the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National \nForest. I ask the Chairman and Senator Dorgan if that is their \nunderstanding as well?\n  Mr. BURNS. It is my understanding.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I concur and suggest we address this error through the \nconference report.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the chairman and ranking member, and appreciate \nthe suggestion that we clarify this in the conference report \naccompanying H.R. 2361, so that the report will read ``Mt Baker-\nSnoqualmie National Forest--I-90 Corridor'' in the State of Washington.\n  Mr. BURNS. We will see that the change is made.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank Chairman Burns and Senator Dorgan for their \nassistance in clarifying this matter.\n\n\n                 bia water technician training program\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I speak on the pending Interior and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations bill for FY 2006. I would to discuss \nthe Committee recommendation for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, BIA, \nWater Management and Planning program.\n  I thank the distinguished Chairman of the Interior Appropriations \nSubcommittee, Senator Burns, and the distinguished ranking member, \nSenator Dorgan, for restoring $2 million to the President's budget \nrequest for BIA Water Management and Planning. These funds are very \nimportant to the Indian Tribes and Pueblos in the State of New Mexico.\n  I am particularly interested in the Water Technician Training program \nthat is funded within this BIA program. The BIA Water Technician \nTraining program trains Native Americans to manage water resources on \ntheir reservation lands. The program trains tribal members in a broad \nrange of water-related fields, including hydrology, fish and wildlife \nbiology, irrigation, soil surveys, dam operation, surface and ground \nwater pollution, and forest management. Training is offered at \nuniversity campuses, including New Mexico State University.\n  The program curriculum is developed with Federal agency partners, \nincluding the Bureau of Reclamation, Army Corps of Engineers, \nDepartment of Interior agencies, the Environmental Protection Agency, \nand the Forest Service. With this technical training, tribal members \nwork to manage and preserve water and other natural resources for the \nbenefit of the tribe. The program provides educational and employment \nopportunities and economic benefits.\n  May I inquire of the distinguished Chairman if it is the intention of \nthe Subcommittee in restoring $2 million to the BIA Water Management \nand Planning Program to continue the Water Technician Training program, \nwhich is currently receiving $400,000?\n  Mr. BURNS. The Senator from New Mexico is correct. The committee \nrestored $2 million to the BIA budget request for Water Management and \nPlanning activities and continues funding for the BIA Water Technician \nTraining program, which the administration proposed to eliminate.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I agree with the distinguished Senator from Montana that \nthis is the intent of the committee bill, and the Senate expects the \nadministration to fund the BIA Water Technician Training program at the \ncurrent level of $400,000.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank my colleagues for this assurance. I appreciate \ntheir confirmation as to continuation of funding for the BIA Water \nTechnician Training program.\n\n\n               Grand Teton national park visitors center\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to ask the distinguished \nchairman for his assistance in solving a problem that I hope he, too, \nwould agree needs fixing.\n  In the fiscal year 04 and fiscal year 05 appropriations, Congress \nprovided a total of $8 million in the NPS construction account to build \na visitors center at Grand Teton National Park. Private partners will \ncontribute $10 million.\n  The Park Service has asked the private partners to deposit their \nshare in an escrowed Treasury account prior to the start of \nconstruction. To meet that requirement, the private partners will \nborrow the funds from a commercial bank and therefore begin accruing \ninterest expense immediately even though the majority of the funds may \nnot be needed for 12 to 18 months.\n  The private partners would prefer to meet their commitment by giving \nthe NPS an irrevocable letter of credit due and payable from a bank or \nfinancial institution organized and authorized to transact business in \nthe United State. It would save them upwards to $800,000 in interest \npayments over the construction period--funds that could be used for \nother park projects.\n  The National Park Service believes they don't have the authority to \naccept a letter or credit unless specifically authorized by Congress, \nAnti-Deficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. 1341(a)(1).\n  As chairman of the National Parks Subcommittee of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, it is my goal to encourage partnerships \nthat benefit our parks while at the same time insuring that the \nGovernment's interest is protected.\n  I ask that we work together between now and conference to evaluate \nways these two goals can be accomplished. Specifically, I would like to \ngrant the NPS the authority to accept an irrevocable letter of credit \nif we can be convinced the government's interest would be protected.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, the role of partnerships is rapidly \nchanging and our subcommittee has encouraged the Park Service to \ndevelop guidelines and standards for their partners. I am encouraged by \nthe progress. It also seems appropriate that we not hobble partners \nwith unnecessary and expensive requirements. I will be glad to look at \nways to do that.\n\n\n                    rahway valley sewerage authority\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the Senator's \nattention a very important project in my home State of New Jersey that \nI believe should be given strong consideration for funding. The Rahway \nValley Sewerage Authority is currently undertaking a project on a grand \nscale. In 1998, the Environmental Protection Agency directed the \nauthority to expand its wastewater treatment capacity in order to meet \nwet weather sanitary sewage overflow requirements by 2008. The \nestimated cost of this large project was $68 million at the time.\n\n[[Page S7590]]\n\nThat estimate proved to be optimistic. The present day cost estimate \nfor the project is $235 million.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Lautenberg, \nfor bringing this project to the attention of the ranking member of the \nInterior Appropriations Subcommittee. This project is quite costly for \nthe authority and the State of New Jersey and will lead to the tripling \nof sewer rates for residents in 12 communities in the area. I believe \nthat any funding assistance that the federal government can provide \nwould be put to very good use.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senators from the State of New \nJersey. This program sounds very important but how does the Rahway \nValley Sewerage Authority plan to tackle this large task?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The authority, as required by the consent order, has \ndeveloped a comprehensive strategic plan to comply with the order. A \ncritical component of the plan is the construction of a new gravity \nrelief sewer that will convey combined sanitary sewage overflows for \nenhanced treatment at the upgraded plant. The authority has focused its \nrequest for Federal funding exclusively on this gravity relief sewer \nfacility. The gravity relief sewer facility is estimated to cost $10.9 \nmillion in its entirety. Federal funding can play an important role in \nfinancing this cost and in facilitating the early construction of this \nmuch needed project.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank my colleagues from New Jersey and I thank them \nfor bringing this project to my attention. This does sound like a good \nproject and as this bill moves to conference we will try and do what we \ncan for it.\n  Mr. BURNS. I concur with the ranking member. I believe this project \ndoes have merit, and we will see what we can do for this project as \nthis bill moves to conference.\n\n\n                      competitive sourcing process\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it is no secret that there have long \nbeen concerns about the competitive sourcing process at the Forest \nService. I commend the chairman and ranking member for their attention \nto this issue in the underlying bill, which reflects those concerns by \nlimiting the amount of funding that the Forest Service may use during \nfiscal year 2006 for competitive sourcing studies and related \nactivities. The underlying bill also requires agencies funded by this \nbill to ``include the incremental costs directly attributable to \nconducting the competitive sourcing competitions'' in any reports to \nthe Appropriations Committee about such studies and stipulates that \nsuch costs should be reported ``in accordance with full cost accounting \nprinciples.'' The fiscal year 2006 Interior appropriations bill that \nthe other body passed last month contains similar language, and also \ndirects the Forest Service to provide quarterly reports on its related \nbusiness process reengineering efforts.\n  The American people deserve to know how their tax dollars are being \nspent and if the Forest Service's competitive sourcing process is \nresulting in true savings, which should include a full cost accounting \nof all of the related savings and losses associated with this process.\n  An amendment I proposed to the bill would have required the General \nAccountability Office to conduct an audit of existing Forest Service \ncompetitive sourcing procedures and to make recommendations on how \nthese procedures can be improved, including recommendations on what \naccounting practices should be adopted, by the Forest Service to \nimprove accountability.\n  It is my understanding that the chairman and the ranking member have \nagreed to work with me to request such an audit.\n  Mr. BURNS. The Senator is correct. I am willing to work with the \nSenator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, and the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee, Mr. Dorgan to request in writing this audit by the \nGovernment Accountability Office.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be happy to assist with such a request for a GAO \naudit of the Forest Service's competitive sourcing initiative.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their \nassistance on this important issue. I look forward to reviewing GAO's \nfindings.\n\n\n             northeast states forestry research cooperative\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an important \nmatter with the Chairman and ranking member of the Interior \nAppropriations Subcommittee regarding a provision in the Senate bill \nwhich provides funding for the Northeast States Forestry Research \nCooperative.\n  Congress authorized the creation of the Northeast States Forestry \nResearch Cooperative in the 1998 Agricultural Research Act. The \nauthorization directed the Secretary of Agriculture to provide funding \nto land grant colleges and universities and natural resources and \nforestry schools in the States of New York, Maine, New Hampshire, and \nVermont for research, technology transfer and other activities related \nto ecosystem health, forest management, development of forest products \nand alternative renewable energy.\n  While I certainly support funding for Maine, Vermont and New \nHampshire, I believe that New York, and our lead institution, the SUNY \nCollege of Environmental Science and Forestry, has been left out of the \nfunding pool and ought to be included in this year's Interior \nAppropriations bill.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Senator from New York for her comments about \nthe Northeast States Forestry Research Cooperative. We did provide \nadditional funding to allow Maine to become integrated into the \ncooperative and I appreciate the Senator's position with respect to her \nState of New York. I will consider additional funding as the bill moves \nto conference.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York. I know \nthe Senator has advocated for including New York in the account that \nfunds the Northeast States Forestry Research Cooperative. This is a \ngreat program that provides significant research, economic development, \nand technology transfers related to our Nation's forests. I applaud the \nSenator for her continued advocacy and I want to assure her that I will \nwork with the Chairman to consider additional funding as the Interior \nbill moves to conference with the House.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I thank the Chairman and ranking member of the Interior \nAppropriations Subcommittee. When one considers that New York's \nnorthern forests are more than three times the size of those in New \nHampshire and Vermont combined, I believe that adding New York for \nfunding is the right thing to do.\n  The forest products industry is a major contributor to the New York \nState and national economy. New York's forest products industry is the \nfifth largest manufacturing sector employing more than 60,000 people. \nIt is estimated that forest-based manufacturing and forest-related \ntourism and recreation contribute more than $9 billion to New York \nState's economy each year. Jobs in these areas must be sustained to \nensure our forest communities remain strong. These forests must be \nmanaged wisely through sustainable development that recognizes the \nneeds of these communities, but also values the benefits derived from \nAmerica's forests. This is particularly true when considering that \nthese forests cover 75 percent of the critical New York City watershed.\n  This investment will provide economic benefits that contribute to \n``smart energy'' demonstrations and commercialization of wood-based \nbio-refining technology which will advance biofuels, and other natural \nindustries in New York State.\n  I thank the chairman and ranking member for their willingness to \nconsider additional funding to include New York as part of the \nNortheast States Forestry Research Cooperative.\n\n\n            Lake Mead National Recreation Area Water Systems\n\n  Mr. REID. I am proud to represent a State with so many natural \ntreasures. Of particular importance to me is the Lake Mead Natural \nRecreation Area, which is managed by the National Park Service. Because \nof its amazing natural beauty and its proximity to the residents of \nboth southern Nevada and northern Arizona, Lake Mead receives nearly 10 \nmillion visitors a year. I rise today to bring attention to a water and \nwastewater maintenance project at Lake Mead that is need of serious \nattention. Is the distinguished ranking member familiar with the \nbeautiful Lake Mead National Recreation Area?\n\n[[Page S7591]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am indeed. The Senator should be proud to have such a \njewel in his State. Lake Mead is not only a great recreation site \nwithin Nevada's borders, but is known worldwide for its clean waters \nand the unforgettable Hoover Dam that was a vital public works project \nduring the Great Depression. I understand that the project that the \ndistinguished minority leader is concerned with was included in the \nPresident's budget as one of the Park Service's main priorities. Is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from North Dakota is correct. Because Lake \nMead's water and wastewater facilities were constructed in the 1950s, \nand some as long ago as the 1930s, the National Park Service and the \nPresident put these projects forward as priorities. Failure of the \nwater systems--including force mains, gravity mains and manholes--would \ncause significant risks to public health and the environment due to \ndischarges of raw sewage from these systems. Sewage is generated at the \nlowest point in these systems due to waste-generating activities \noccurring close to the lake, so the pristine water quality of Lake Mead \nand Lake Mohave could be jeopardized if there were a major spill caused \nby catastrophic failure of one of these mains. Failure of any force \nmain would also virtually shut down all commercial, residential, and \nrecreational use within the development and could expose visitors and \nemployees and their families to the risk of disease transmission via \ndirect physical contact with raw sewage, as well as undermining roads, \nbuildings, utility lines, or other structures due to high-pressure \nspray. In short, this is no little problem.\n  Mr. BURNS. It is my understanding, Mr. President, that the \nadministration's budget requested $9.4 million to deal with phase-1 \nimprovements to the water and wastewater systems at Lake Mead.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is exactly right.\n  Mr. BURNS. Well, let me assure the minority leader that we will look \nfor ways to help fund this long overdue maintenance of Lake Mead's \nwater and wastewater systems. One option we can consider is to find \nfunding for the failing wastewater system this year--I am told this is \nroughly $2.7 million--since it seems to pose the greatest threat to \nLake Mead and its visitors. And we will certainly give the rest of the \nproject the attention it deserves.\n  Mr. REID. The chairman and ranking member are very kind to share my \ninterest in this project. I greatly appreciate their assistance on this \nimportant issue.\n\n\n                   Indian Health Facilities in Nevada\n\n  Mr. REID. The Indian Health Service which is funded by this bill, is \nthe agency charged with providing health care services to Native \nAmerican people. We in this body must work to ensure that the Indian \nHealth Service is meeting the needs of all Native Americans. My State \nis home to 22 Indian tribes, all of which are served by the Phoenix \narea office of the IHS. That same office also provides health services \nto the Indians of Arizona and Utah, except for the Navajo Nation. Am I \ncorrect that this year's appropriations bill contains $8 million in \nfunding for the construction of one of the ambulatory care clinics in \nthe Phoenix area of the IHS?\n  Mr. BURNS. The Senator is correct. The Phoenix Indian Medical Center \nHospital System is at the top of the priority list for replacement of \nits inpatient facility. As part of this replacement, three ambulatory \nclinics will be constructed in the region to provide better health care \nservices to the tribes in the area, including those in Nevada. The \namount of $4 million in planning funds for design of two of the \ncenter's clinics was provided last year. This year, an additional $8 \nmillion for the construction of one of the clinics that is part of that \nproject is recommended in the Senate bill.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Senator. The tribes in my State are supportive \nof efforts to improve health care for tribes in Phoenix. They have told \nme that--of all the challenges that confront tribes today--health care \nis by far the most urgent, and perhaps the most daunting. I thank the \nSenator and the members of his subcommittee for realizing the \nimportance of Indian health care and providing resources for it.\n  However, the tribes in my State face another challenge in terms of \nthe replacement of this medical center system. The current plans call \nfor the replacement of three out-patient clinics in the Phoenix \nmetropolitan area, and will provide for the eventual renovation of the \nin-patient medical center. These are important projects. However, \ntribes in Nevada cannot realistically make use of these centers. Tribes \nin Northern Nevada, for instance, are more than a day's drive from \nPhoenix.\n  I am told that the Indian Health Services' plans to replace the \nPhoenix Indian Medical Center system were developed without adequately \naccounting for the health care needs of eligible beneficiaries in \noutlying areas, like Nevada, Utah or rural Arizona. I am also told that \nshould those plans move ahead, the resulting health care delivery \nsystem will disadvantage eligible beneficiaries that reside a distance \naway from the Medical Center.\n  In order to address these concerns, it is especially important to me \nthat the IHS meet and discuss with Nevada tribes ways to improve health \ncare services in Nevada, including facility needs and the Contract \nHealth Services Program. In addition, I expect that these meetings will \nresult in a report to the committe, with recommendations, to assist the \ncommittee in its ongoing efforts to improve the quality of health care \nfor Nevada's Native Americans.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Senator. My State has several Indian tribes \nas well, and I am aware of the challenges that they face. I assure the \nminority leader that the committee is aware of the Indian health needs \nin Nevada and expects that IHS will, No. 1, continue to meet and \ndiscuss with the 22 tribes in Nevada, as well as the Intertribal Health \nBoard of Nevada and the Intertribal Health Board of Nevada, in an \neffort to find ways to improve the delivery and quality of health \nservices to Native Americans in Nevada, and, No. 2, will report back to \nthe committee in writing, with recommendations, on how to improve \nsecondary and tertiary care in Nevada.\n  Mr. BURNS. My State of Montana is home to tens of thousands of Native \nAmericans, and I am familiar with the health care challenges that they \nand other Native Americans around the Nation face. I understand that \nthe minority leader expects IHS to meet with all Nevada tribes to \ndiscuss ways to improve their health care services.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I look forward to working with the Senators \nto ensure that Indian beneficiaries in Nevada receive the critical \nhealth care funding that they need. I thank the Senators for their work \non behalf of Native Americans throughout Nevada and the Nation, and I \nthank them for engaging in this colloquy.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1030\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, on May 24, 1999, the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs produced an agreement regarding the funding formula for the two \nBIA postsecondary schools Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute, \nknown as SIPI, and Haskell Indian Nations University. SIPI and Haskell \nagreed that while base funding for each institution would not be \nimpacted, all new funds would be proportionately distributed to each \nschool based on unmet student need. In accordance with the agreement, \nBIA developed a formula for unmet need.\n  In the conference report to Public Law 106-113, the Interior \nAppropriations bill, Congress then directed BIA to allocate funds for \nSIPI and Haskell for fiscal year 2000 as determined by such formula. \nSince then, however, BIA has not used the formula agreed upon by all \nparties, but should have, as Congress directed.\n  Mr. BURNS. The Senator from New Mexico is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I agree with the chair and the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask if the chair and ranking member would work with \nme, should funding become available, to find $178,730 in conference for \nSIPI, which is the amount of funds I believe is needed to correct this \nsituation for the period that the formula should have been used \naccording to Congressional direction, up to and including fiscal year \n2006.\n  Mr. BURNS. I will be happy to consider the Senator's request should \nfunding become available.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I, too, will do my best to help solve this problem.\n\n[[Page S7592]]\n\n                       highlands conservation act\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, on November 30, 2004, President Bush \nsigned the bipartisan Highlands Conservation Act into law to authorize \nup to $11 million per year over the next 10 years for land conservation \npartnership projects and open space purchases from willing sellers in \nthe four-state Highlands Region.\n  This law recognizes the national significance of land and water \nresources in the 3.5 million acre Highlands Region which stretches from \nnorthwestern Connecticut, across the lower Hudson River Valley in New \nYork, through New Jersey and into east-central Pennsylvania. It will \nsafeguard these critical resources to protect the pristine wilderness \nand wildlife of the Highlands.\n  The value of the natural, recreational and scenic resources of the \nHighlands cannot be overstated. In a study of the New York-New Jersey \nHighlands region alone, the Forest Service found that 170 million \ngallons are drawn from the Highlands aquifers daily, providing quality \ndrinking water for over 11 million people; 247 threatened or endangered \nspecies live in the New Jersey-New York Highlands region, including the \ntimber rattlesnake, wood turtle, red-shouldered hawk, barred owl, and \ngreat blue heron. According to the U.S. Forest Service, over 14 million \npeople visit the New York-New Jersey Highlands for outdoor recreation, \nmore than Yellowstone National Park and our most heavily visited \nnatural treasures.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. According to the Forest Service, more than 5,000 \nacres of forest and farm land in the New York and New Jersey sections \nof the Highlands have been lost annually to development between 1995 \nand 2000, and nearly 300,000 acres of land critical to future water \nsupplies remain unprotected. As the demand for new housing and other \ntypes of development continues to alter the vast areas of forest and \nopen space in our region, it is important that Congress acts now to \nprovide funding to preserve the high priority open space that remains. \nI appreciate the consideration by my colleagues from North Dakota and \nMontana of the importance of protecting the Highlands Region.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I was proud to work with my colleagues in the Senate, \nSenators Lautenberg, Clinton, Schumer, Specter, Santorum, Lieberman and \nDodd, and my colleague in the \nHouse of Representatives, Congressman Frelinghuysen to enact the \nHighlands Conservation Act into law. To secure appropriations to match \nthe authorization, we requested from the Interior Appropriations \nCommittee $11 million to support open space protection in the four \nHighlands States for fiscal year 2006. Unfortunately, that funding was \nnot included in the bill. This vital funding is needed to protect the \nWyanokie Highlands, Scotts Mountain and Musconetcong Ridge in New \nJersey, as well as to protect threatened areas in New York, Connecticut \nand Pennsylvania. It would also allow the USDA Forest Service to update \nits 1992 study of the Highlands Region to include the States of \nConnecticut and Pennsylvania. We would like to work with the chairman \nand ranking member to ensure they are protected. Will the Senators \nagree that should funding become available during the conference \nproceedings that they will work with us to secure funds to meet the \ngoals of the Highlands Conservation Act and protect the Highlands, \nespecially the New Jersey Region?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I agree with the Senators from New Jersey that the \nHighlands Region is a vital national resource. If there are funds \navailable in the conference report, I will work with the Senators to \nsee if we can secure the funding needed to protect this region.\n  Mr. BURNS. I understand the importance of the Highlands Region. \nShould funding become available during conference proceedings, I will \nwork with my colleagues to seek funds to support land conservation \npartnership projects and open space purchases from willing sellers in \nthe Highlands region.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1031\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, my amendment provides more opportunities \nfor Youth Conservation Corps to partner with the land management \nagencies funded through this bill. In addition, according to agency \ninformation, it would save the taxpayers money.\n  For decades, we have included a provision in this bill requiring the \nland management agencies to carry out some of their projects in \npartnership with the Youth Conservation Corps. In the mid-1970s, we \nfunded the YCC program at $60 million each year. Unfortunately, \nCongress has more or less forgotten the YCC for the last 5 years, which \nis how long it has been since we increased the modest setaside for the \nprograms to about $7 million.\n  YCC projects range from building trails and campsites, to restoring \nwatersheds and monuments, to eradicating exotic pests and weeds. The \nYouth Corps bring to the agencies enthusiastic young adults that are \nready to work hard to improve our public lands. The youth corps members \ncome away with a good job and invaluable experiences.\n  In New Mexico, for example, the Rocky Mountain Youth Corps has \npartnered with all of these agencies to carry our many projects over \nthe years. One project was to create a scenic lakeside trail with an \ninterpretive nature component in the Carson National Forest. Recently, \nthe site was listed as one of the top 15 camping sites in New Mexico, \nand the lakeside trail is an integral component of that camping \nexperience.\n  We held a hearing on the YCC program in the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources a few years ago, and the Park Service Director \ntestified that his agency received $1.70 in benefits for every $1.00 it \ninvested in YCC projects. The Fish and Wildlife Service estimated that \nit received $2.00 dollars for every $1.00 it invested. Supporting this \nprogram is good fiscal policy.\n  My amendment would provide a modest increase of almost $2 million in \nthe YCC setaside, to be spread among the four agencies. This does \nlittle more than prevent the program from shrinking from where it was 5 \nyears ago, but it would result in tangible benefits to our youth, our \npublic lands, and our budget.\n  This amendment is good education policy, good public lands policy, \ngood economic policy, good government policy, and good fiscal policy. I \nam gratified that this amendment was adopted.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1050\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to the withdrawal of my \namendment No. 1050 to H.R. 2361, the pending Interior Appropriations \nbill. Although the amendment was withdrawn, I remain committed to \naddressing the funding inequities in the EPA-administered Clean Water \nAct State Revolving Fund--CWA SRF--the primary Federal mechanism for \nfinancing clean water and wastewater infrastructure projects \nnationwide.\n  I applaud both Senator Burns and Senator Dorgan, the chairman and \nranking member respectively, for recognizing the importance of this \nprogram and funding it at the fiscal year 2005 level of $1.09 billion \nin this tight budget year.\n  Our States do depend on CWA SRF to provide much needed financial \nassistance in the form of low interest loans to towns and cities to \nhelp defray the costs of maintaining and upgrading their water \ntreatment systems. It is especially beneficial for small rural water \ncompanies that serve so much of the Western and Midwestern States.\n  However, providing level funding for the CWA SRF is not enough. We \nhave a more fundamental problem that needs to be addressed with regard \nto the CWA SRF. That is, the inequities built into the current CWA SRF \nformula which will determine how much of the $1.09 billion each State \ngets. Senator Burns recognizes that too, and has agreed to work with me \nto correct it.\n  Congress adopted the current allocation formula in the 1987 \namendments to the Clean Water Act. The formula was developed behind \nclosed doors during the conference.\n  Nowhere in the legislative history of Congress' final action on the \n1987 amendments is there a clear statement about how it came up with \nthe final allocation formula--it is even difficult to guess. The \nconference report on the final legislation merely states: ``The \nConference substitute adopts a new formula for distributing \nconstruction grant funds and the state revolving loan fund \ncapitalization grant funds and the state revolving loan fund \ncapitalization grants among the states for\n\n[[Page S7593]]\n\nfiscal years 1987 through 1990.'' The allocations are fixed, statutory \npercentages. That is to say, once the Act was signed into law, each \nwould receive the same share of available funds in perpetuity, unless \nthe Act itself is amended.\n  This is not the first time I have come to the floor to persuade my \ncolleagues to act to change this formula, and I doubt it will be the \nlast. Some of you may remember that we had a very good debate on August \n2, 2001, during the Senate's consideration of the VA-HUD appropriations \nbill on this very issue that resulted in the Senate expressing its \nsense about the need to report authorizing legislation that included an \nequitable, needs-based formula.\n  As my constituents remind me, we have yet to either amend or \nreauthorize the portion of the Clean Water Act pertaining to the CWA \nSRF or the faulty formula. Year after year promises are made but \nnothing happens. The authorizing committee has had years to change the \nformula and has not done so. There is a reason nothing happens-- \nbecause the States that benefit from the current formula do not want it \nto change. There is nothing wrong with that. I do not blame them, but \nthere comes a time when one's patience wears thin. I think we have an \nobligation to say enough is enough. We must change the formula.\n\n  After all, let's look at the current situation we face in the bill \nbefore us. We are appropriating dollars to an unauthorized program--it \nexpired in 1990--using a statutory formula set 19 years ago that bears \nno relationship to the actual needs reported by the states. That is \nsad, and it needs to change.\n  It is interesting to note that, when Congress enacted the 1996 Safe \nDrinking Water Act, we ensured that no such inequity would haunt the \nnewly created Drinking Water State Revolving Fund. From its inception, \nthe Drinking Water Fund was allocated on the basis of a quadrennial \ninfrastructure needs survey conducted by the various States under EPA \nsupervision and guidance. The survey involves the States in determining \ntheir own needs for drinking water infrastructure to ensure compliance \nwith EPA regulations. The EPA, in turn, validates the state submissions \nand compiles them in a report to Congress. The EPA then allocates \nDrinking Water Fund appropriations on the basis of each State's \nproportional share of the total need.\n  There is a fundamental fairness associated with allocating the funds \non the basis of the survey. The States themselves participate in the \nsurvey. The EPA has oversight, but in the end, valid needs are simply \ncompiled into the aggregate, and the resulting State share of the total \nnational need determine Drinking Water Fund allocations among the \nStates.\n  Unfortunately, as we all know, the same is not true for the much \nlarger CWA SRF. A Clean Water Needs Survey is performed by the States \nevery 4 years called the ``Clean Watershed Needs Survey'' and the EPA \nin fashion similar to the compilation of the Drinking Water Needs \nSurvey validates the State's submissions and compiles them in a report \nto Congress. The Clean Watershed Needs Survey, however, has no impact \non CWA SRF allocations.\n  I believe, as I am sure do most of my fair-minded colleagues, that we \nmust work together to right this wrong. There is no reason for the \nDrinking Water Fund to be allocated fairly on the basis of actual need, \nwhile the CWA SRF is allocated on an arcane set of fixed percentages \nthat were established before most of us were elected to Congress.\n  So what does my amendment do? What my amendment would do is update \nthe funding formula using the Drinking Water Fund formula as precedent. \nUnder my amendment, each State would receive funds based on its share \nof the total 20 year-clean watershed infrastructure needs, as \ndocumented in the most recent Clean Watershed Needs Survey, with no \nState receiving less than 1 percent of the total appropriated for the \nCWA SRF. There would be up to 1.5 percent set aside for Indian Tribes \nand 0.25 percent for all the U.S. territories.\n  What I am saying is, let's even out the playing field and make sure \nthat everybody gets at least a share closer to what the EPA says they \ndeserve to have. That is what we are trying to do, make it fair for \neverybody.\n  Let me cite some examples that demonstrate the fundamental unfairness \nof the current formula in contrast to my amendment. There are 12 States \nthat are receiving more funding than the minimum allocation and more \nthan they documented in needs in the survey. These States would lose \nthe windfall they are currently receiving under my amendment.\n  But there are some States, like New Jersey and Florida, that are \nreceiving significantly less than their share. My amendment would \ncorrect this inequity. New Jersey, for example, would receive about $45 \nmillion under the current formula. It would receive almost $61 million \nunder my amendment--about a $16 million increase. Florida would receive \nabout $37 million under the current formula but would receive almost \n$48 million under my amendment--about a $10 million increase. The \nincreases these States receive demonstrate the fact that they have been \nsignificantly shortchanged in the past. My home State falls into this \ncategory. Arizona ranks 10th in need according to the latest EPA Clean \nWatershed Needs Survey. However, Arizona ranks dead last, behind all \nthe States and Puerto Rico in the percentage of needs met under the \ncurrent formula. In terms of dollars, Arizona would receive about $7 \nmillion under the current formula, but would receive almost $31 million \nunder my amendment. I am sure now it is clear why I am standing here.\n  My amendment also helps small States. Those States would receive the \nminimum allotment, which is actually a greater percentage than they \nshould based on the needs they documented in the needs survey. There \nare five other States that will see a reduction in what they receive, \nbut these States have had a larger percentage of their total needs \nfunded under the current formula since it was enacted. The state of New \nYork is an example. New York is No. 1 in need and No. 1 in total \ndollars received out of the CWA SRF. I should point out that although \nNew York's total allocation would go down under my amendment it would \ncontinue to rank No. 1 in terms of dollars allocated. New York would \nreceive approximately $95 million.\n  The formula that I proposed in my amendment assures that each State \ncould meet the clean water needs of its citizens by bringing \nfundamental fairness to the allocation of the appropriated dollars. It \nensures that all States receive a fair share, and recognizes that needs \nchange over time. By changing the formula to comport with the needs \nsurvey, it will adjust to changing circumstances and, thus, will \nprotect all states.\n  If my colleagues have a better formula I urge them to come forward \nwith it. This issue is not going away. Senator Burns recognizes that. \nIn return for my withdrawal of this amendment, he has agreed to work \nwith me to persuade the authorizing committee to get this done. I thank \nhim for that.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I wish to register my opposition to the \nKyl amendment No. 1050 to H.R. 2361, the Senate Interior Appropriations \nbill.\n  The Clean Water State Revolving Fund Program is essential for \nprotecting public health, watersheds, and the natural environment by \nproviding critical federal seed money for the maintenance and \nimprovement of water infrastructure. Despite important progress in \nprotecting and enhancing water quality since the enactment of the Clean \nWater Act in 1972, serious water pollution problems persist throughout \nthe Nation.\n  The need for continued Federal investment in the Nation's water \ninfrastructure is undeniable. The Environmental Protection Agency's \nSeptember 30, 2002 Clean Water and Drinking Water Infrastructure Gap \nAnalysis found that there will be a $535 billion gap between current \nspending and projected needs for water and wastewater infrastructure \nover the next 20 years if additional investments are not made. In \nNovember 2002, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the \nannual investment in clean water infrastructure needs to be at least \n$13 billion for capital construction and $20.3 billion for operation \nand maintenance.\n  The Kyl amendment would restructure the current formula for \ndistributing federal funding to the states under the Clean Water State \nRevolving Fund, SRF, Program. As chairman of\n\n[[Page S7594]]\n\nthe Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife, and Water, with authorizing \njurisdiction over the Clean Water Act and the SRF Program, I thank \nSenator Kyl for his interest in the clean water formula.\n  However, I believe the Interior appropriations bill is the wrong \nforum for discussion of any statutory changes to the Clean Water SRF \nformula. Members of the subcommittee and the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee are working closely to craft water infrastructure \nlegislation that would authorize new funding for the Clean Water and \nDrinking Water SRFs, as well as address the antiquated Clean Water SRF \nformula.\n  Senator Kyl is correct, the Clean Water SRF formula is in need of \nrevision. Arizona is one of many States that have seen their needs grow \nsince the last time the formula was updated in 1987. The Environment \nand Public Works Committee is working on the necessary changes to the \nSRF, and hope to move water infrastructure legislation by the end of \nthe summer.\n  I encourage my fellow colleagues to oppose the Kyl amendment and \nsupport the ongoing process of updating the Clean Water formula by the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, to begin, let me assure my colleague that \nas chairman of the Environmental and Public Works Committee, I am fully \naware of how important this issue is to his State of Arizona. His \nState's current allocation under the Clean Water Act is well below the \nState's proportional need.\n  As my colleague knows, the EPW Committee has for the past two \nCongresses passed legislation to reauthorize the Clean Water and \nDrinking Water SRFs. In those bills, the committee also rewrote the \nclean water formula. My colleagues Senators Jeffords, Chafee and \nClinton and I are working on a new proposal and feel confident that \nunlike our previous efforts, this bill will be enacted into law.\n  My State of Oklahoma would get more money under the Kyl formula than \nunder the current allocation. I would like to support your amendment \nbecause it brings more dollars home to Oklahoma. However, all States \nneed more water infrastructure money as their systems age and struggle \nto meet the ever-growing list of Federal regulations. There is a \nsignificant nationwide shortage of funds that is affecting all States.\n  Given current Federal appropriations, there is simply no way to \nrewrite the formula so that all States win. If we change the formula, \nwithout reauthorizing the State Revolving Loan Funds, some States will \nhave to lose money. In order to assure that each State receives \nsufficient funds to run an effective program, we need to enact water \ninfrastructure legislation which raises the authorization level for \nthis important program while also addressing the formula. The \ncommittee's long-term goal is to keep everyone whole because all States \nneed more money not less. I hope all of my colleagues who care strongly \nabout the Kyl amendment will rally around the bill that we hope to pass \nout of committee next month.\n  The committee will do as the Senate promised Senator Kyl during the \n107th Congress and pass another formula. We will put forth a proposal \nthat minimizes the pain to those States that will see their clean water \nfunding cut while providing modest increases to other States. We will \ncontinue to work to increase the authorization to this important \nprogram so that the needs of all States can be met.\n  I appreciate my colleague's willingness to withdraw his amendment and \nallow the committee to do its work.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Kyl \namendment No. 1050.\n  This amendment seeks to change the distribution formula for the Clean \nWater State Revolving Fund which sends money to the states for water \ninfrastructure projects.\n  The Clean Water Act is within the jurisdiction of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, of which I am the ranking member. We are aware \nof the issues raised by Senator Kyl in this amendment--the distribution \nformula is outdated. It was adopted in 1987 and has not changed.\n  Arizona receives a very small percentage of the total through this \nformula. However, an appropriations bill is not the right place for \nthis change in authorizing legislation. A change of this magnitude \nneeds to be worked through the authorizing committee.\n  There are serious consequences to this type of action. For example, \nunder the Kyl formula, the State of Ohio loses 30 percent of its \ncurrent allocation. Tennessee would lose 32 percent. Michigan would \nlose 57 percent. Massachusetts would lose 38 percent of its current \nallocation.\n  In the last two Congresses, the EPW Committee has acted to update the \nformula and increase funding levels for the Clean Water State Revolving \nFund. This Congress, we are again planning to move this legislation \nthrough the committee in just a few weeks.\n  I cannot support an amendment making a change of this significance on \nan appropriations bill. There are also some problems with the language \nin the Kyl amendment.\n  It calls for States to receive at least 1 percent of the total if \ntheir need is less than 1 percent and it simultaneously calls for all \nother States to receive their need. This is simply impossible to do.\n  With a finite pot of money, in order to establish a 1 percent floor, \nit is necessary to take some funds away from nonfloor States. The Kyl \namendment fails to include this step in the process.\n  In addition, the Kyl amendment includes a provision dealing with \nunallocated balances. Again, there are no unallocated balances in a \nformula that distributes 100 percent of the available money.\n  The Senate should not act on an authorizing change of this magnitude \non an appropriations bill. The Environment and Public Works Committee \nis on the verge of marking up legislation dealing with this exact \nissue.\n  In addition, there are technical problems with the Kyl amendment that \nwould make it impossible to implement. Therefore, I urge my colleagues \nto vote ``no'' on the Kyl amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I was necessarily absent from the Senate \nyesterday and missed rollcall votes 158 through 160. There were two \nreasons for my absence. First, I attended a memorial service for Mrs. \nMarcia Lieberman, the mother of our colleague, Joseph Lieberman. \nSecond, I attended memorial services for Robert Killian Sr., the former \nLieutenant Governor of Connecticut, a close friend to me and my family. \nHad I been present for these votes, I would have voted as follows:\n  Rollcall vote No. 158: ``Yea''; rollcall vote No. 159: ``Nay''; \nrollcall vote No. 160: ``yea''.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to spend a moment talking \nabout the funding of critical programs under the jurisdiction of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, EPA. While I am pleased with the \nAppropriations Committee's efforts to fund the State Revolving Fund for \nWastewater Treatment and for Drinking Water at the highest possible \nlevels, I am gravely concerned about the overall cut in environmental \nspending contained in the bill before us today.\n  A clean and healthy environment may be our most important legacy for \nour children. It saddens me to think that under the guise of fiscal \nresponsibility, the bill before us today cuts spending at the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, EPA, to levels not seen since fiscal \nyear 2001. This bill funds the EPA at $7.88 billion. As recently as \nfiscal year 2004, the EPA received $8.365 billion. This is a cut of \nalmost $500 million in just 2 years.\n  Because of the administration's fiscal policies and priorities, which \nhave led to record deficits, we are now going to underfund many \nprograms that are important to the protection of public health and the \nenvironment. While I appreciate the dire straits that the Interior \nSubcommittee members found themselves in, particularly relative to \nother subcommittee's allocations, I am very concerned with some of the \nproposed cuts. In addition, I am very concerned that these levels will \ndrop further in conference with the House, which is significantly more \nhostile to such programs under its current leadership.\n  I want to highlight a few of the funding reductions in air protection \nprograms that I am concerned about and hope will be increased in \nconference.\n  The bill includes a reduction for the Clean Air Allowance Trading \nprogram.\n\n[[Page S7595]]\n\nThis reduction will impede the implementation of the administration's \nrecently and much-touted clean air interstate rule.\n  The bill recommends a large reduction in EPA's Federal Vehicle and \nFuels Standards and Certification Program. Such a cut from the budget \nrequest appears designed to harm the Agency's ability to proceed on a \nnumber of fronts that would otherwise produce cleaner vehicles and air \nsooner. Specifically, the cuts will make it harder for EPA to propose \nand finalize, as promised in regulation and, in some cases, directed by \nCongress, a rule on mobile source air toxics, on locomotive and marine \ndiesel engine emissions performance, and on small engine emissions \nstandards.\n  This bill would cut by 10 percent EPA's research on national air \nquality standards. Such a cut goes against continuing scientific \nrevelations about the significant harm that air pollution at all levels \ncauses to public health. In addition, this cut could further delay the \nalready late implementation rules for PM-2.5 and the second phase on \nthe ozone standard. At a time when EPA should be focusing heavily on \nrevisions to the PM-2.5 and ozone standards, and the necessary \nscientific research to support those reviews, as well as providing \ncritical advice to the States and local governments on the most \neffective methods of control and monitoring, these reductions cause me \ngreat concern.\n  The bill would reduce the budget request for Federal Support for Air \nQuality Management by $22.7 million. This will cut back on plans for \nthe national clean diesel initiative and substantially delay the EPA's \nefforts to improve the reliability and availability of Air Quality \nIndex forecasts around the Nation. As Senators may know, this is a \nparticularly important tool for the growing population of asthmatic \nchildren. Parents need to know ahead of time if the day will be code \nred, orange or otherwise dangerous to vulnerable populations. Related \ncuts in the Clean Schoolbus program request also need to be restored.\n  Finally, while I appreciate that this bill rejects the \nadministration's proposed cuts in the domestic stratospheric ozone \nprogram, we seem to be headed again toward underfunding our commitment \nto the Montreal Protocol. This international treaty has been a \nresounding success in helping to protect the ozone layer from CFCs. I \ndo not know of a good reason for the United States not to contribute \nits ratified share of the costs of phasing out ozone depleting \nsubstances and developing alternatives on a global basis.\n  This bill would cut spending at the EPA by $144 million from last \nyear's level, and this does not take into account inflation or the \nmandatory cost of pay increases. I will vote for this bill in the hopes \nthat it will become better in conference, and with the recognition that \nthe appropriators have done a good job with limited resources.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I speak about the plight of children \nafflicted by elevated levels of lead in their blood. Although it has \nbeen three decades since lead was a component of paint, the effects of \nlead paint continue to linger in homes across the country. As the lead \npaint flakes off, the dust is inhaled, and some kids eat the chips.\n  Lead is a highly toxic substance that can produce a range of health \nproblems in young children, including damage to the kidneys, the brain, \nand bone marrow. Even low levels of lead in pregnant women, infants, \nand children can affect cognitive abilities and fetal organ development \nand lead to behavioral problems.\n  Over 430,000 children in America have dangerously high blood lead \nlevels. This is a particularly serious problem for Illinois, which has \nthe highest number of lead-poisoned children in the nation. In Chicago \nalone, 6,000 children have elevated blood lead levels.\n  In 1992 Congress passed the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard \nReduction Act. The law required the Environmental Protection Agency, \nEPA, to promulgate regulations by October 1996 regarding contractors \nengaged in home renovation and remodeling activities that create lead-\nbased paint hazards. Renovation and repair of older residences is the \nprincipal source of lead-paint exposure to U.S. children. According to \nFederal studies, a large majority of the approximately 20 to 30 million \nrenovations done on older homes each year are done without lead-safe \ncleanup and contamination practices.\n  The EPA analysis has found that a lead paint regulation would protect \n1.4 million children and prevent 28,000 lead-related illnesses every \nyear. Such a regulation would also lead to a net economic benefit of \nbetween $2.7 billion and $4.2 billion each year.\n  Despite the clear health and economic benefits, these regulations are \nnow 9 years overdue, and there is no sign that EPA is moving any closer \nto issuing the required rules. Last month, I joined with Senator Boxer \nand Representatives Waxman, Lynch, and Towns to express our concern \nabout EPA's complete disregard of the statutory mandate to issue lead \npaint regulations.\n  To address the problem, I have introduced an amendment that would \nstop EPA from spending money on any actions that are contrary to \nCongress' 1992 mandate to issue lead paint regulations, including any \ndelaying of the regulations. I thank the managers of this bill, Senator \nBurns and Senator Dorgan, for their support of this amendment and for \nincluding it in the bill.\n  I hope EPA will read this amendment and understand that the time for \nthese common-sense lead regulations is long overdue.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering the \nInterior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill for \nFiscal Year 2006. This bill provides approximately $26.2 billion in \ndiscretionary spending--approximately $542 million over the President's \nrequest--for the Forest Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, \nthe Indian Health Service, most agencies of the Interior Department--\nexcept the Bureau of Reclamation, and the National Foundation on the \nArts and the Humanities. I commend the members of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, and in particular, the efforts of the \nInterior Appropriations Subcommittee, for completing this appropriation \nbill in a timely manner.\n  Unfortunately, as is the case with many of the appropriations bills \nthat come to the floor, this bill and its accompanying report contains \nearmarks and pork projects which have not been authorized or requested. \nThe bill provides funding for critical programs like forest health and \nrestoration, superfund cleanup, the Land and Water Conservation Fund, \nand PILT, but all too often, many of these accounts are eroded by \nunnecessary, unrequested earmarks.\n  This is especially frustrating given the $600 million annual \nmaintenance backlog that is crippling the National Park system. There \nis not a single member of this body who does not have a National Park \nor monument, or other Park Service unit in his or her State that is not \nin need of attention. And while curbing the use of earmarks might not \nsolve our Nation's enormous deficit or save our National Parks from \nlong-term dilapidation, doing so would be a good step in repairing our \nbroken appropriations process.\n  Let's take a look at some of the earmarks that are in this bill or \nits accompanying report: $875,000 for a new water storage tank in the \nTown of Westerly, RI; $1,000,000 for water treatment projects in the \nTown of Waitsfield, VT; $2,465,000 for sudden oak death research; \n$200,000 for a poultry science project at Stephen F. Austin State \nUniversity, Texas; $1,000,000 for statewide cesspool replacement in the \nCounty of Maui, HI; $1,800,000 for eider and sea otter recovery work at \nthe Alaska SeaLife Center; $1,114,000 for a research laboratory in \nSitka, AK; $500,000 for the University of Northern Iowa to develop new \nenvironmental technologies for small business outreach; $250,000 for \npaper industry byproduct waste reduction research in Wisconsin; \n$500,000 to continue research on pallid sturgeon spawning in the \nMissouri River; $400,000 to complete a bear DNA sampling study in \nMontana--the fourth consecutive year this earmark has been added to an \nappropriations vehicle; $450,000 for a well monitoring project in \nHawaii; $5,100,000 to complete the visitor center at the Little Rock \nCentral High School National Historic Site, Arkansas; $6,059,000 to \nrehab bathhouses at Hot Springs National Park, AR; $160,000 for soil \nsurvey mapping in Wyoming;\n\n[[Page S7596]]\n\n$400,000 for studies on the impact of lead mining in the Mark Twain \nNational Forest; $500,000 for restoration at the Mark Twain Boyhood \nHome National Historic Landmark in Missouri.\n  In what has become perhaps one of the greatest examples of pork \nbarrel politics, the Forest Service has lost more than $850 million \nsince 1982 on timber sales and the construction of access roads for \ncommercial logging in Alaska's Tongass National Forest. More than 4,000 \nmiles of these roads criss-cross the Tongass and have accrued at least \n$100 million in deferred maintenance while serving little public \npurpose. And every year, Congress continues to appropriate funds to \nbuild new roads without accounting for the encumbrance imposed by \nexisting roads. I support commercial logging, but not when it requires \nFederal subsidies that offer no return to the taxpayer. These federally \nfunded roads are meant to stabilize the price of timber logged from the \nTongass, but the program actually costs the Federal treasury tens of \nmillions of dollars each year--nearly $48 million in fiscal year 2004 \nalone--because the value of Tongass lumber is not competitive and so \nthe Forest Service takes a loss on almost every timber contract it \nmanages. To clarify, Mr. President, that is hundreds of millions in \nFederal subsidies just to lose hundreds of millions in unprofitable \nlogging.\n  Mark Twain, a cynic of politicians and government, once wrote: ``One \nof the first achievements of the legislature was to institute a ten-\nthousand-dollar agricultural fair to show off forty dollars worth of \npumpkins.'' I can only speculate what Mark Twain would say about the \negregious waste of taxpayer money allocated to continue the timber \nsubsidy program in the Tongass National Forest.\n  I am pleased to have joined with Senator Sununu and others in \noffering an amendment which would prohibit funding for road building in \nthe Tongas National Forest. I hope my colleagues' will support this \namendment.\n  Many of my colleagues may have forgotten, but it is a violation of \nSenate rules to legislate on an appropriation bill. Directing or \nauthorizing policy is a function reserved for the authorizing \ncommittees, not the appropriations committee. As is done far to \nfrequently, this appropriations bill includes a variety of policy \nchanges. Examples include: Language that authorizes the construction of \na replacement IHS facility in Nome, AK, on land owned by the Sound \nHealth Corporation; Language that allows the Secretary of the Interior \nto collect parking fees at the U.S.S. Arizona Memorial; Language that \nrestricts the use of Forest Service answering machines during business \nhours unless the answering machine includes an option that enables \ncallers to reach an individual. Why is this appearing in an \nappropriation bill? Perhaps the appropriators could exert jurisdiction \nover the waiting lines at the DMV?\n  Also, language that requires National Recreation Reservation Service \ncall centers to be located within the United States and language that \nextends Abandoned Mine Land program until June 30, 2006. This is the \nthird time the AML program has been extended via the appropriations \nprocess.\n  I may not have qualms with many of these particular expenditures and \npolicy items. Some of them may be truly needed and deserving of swift \npassage. However, it is the casual disregard for Senate procedure that \nconcerns me deeply. We need to be protecting the American taxpayer, not \nwaving rules and passing appropriation bills with wasteful spending. We \nneed to be thinking about the future generations who are going to be \npaying the tab for our continued spending, not delivering pork projects \nto special interests and their lobbyists. Surely, my colleagues are \naware of the fiscal challenges facing this Nation. The national debate \nis consumed by questions like: How will we pay for rising Medicare and \nMedicaid costs? Will we be protected from rising energy costs? Will \nSocial Security be there for our children? The answers to those \nquestions fall to the Congress my friends.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I want to thank a lot of folks for their \nwork on this bill we have considered today and over the last few days. \nThis has been a bill we have worked our way through. I wish we could \nhave sped it up. I thank the minority staff, Peter Kiefhaber and \nRachael Taylor and Brooke Thomas. Of course, I thank my good friend \nfrom North Dakota who has really been good to work with. Also, over on \nour side, I thank Bruce Evans, Rebecca Benn, Leif Fonnesbeck, Ginny \nJames, Ryan Thomas, Michele Gordon, and Ellis Fisher. I thank that \nstaff because they have done yeomen's work. They have worked very long \nhours in order to pass this bill.\n  I ask the Senator, do you have any closing remarks?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Burns, who I \nthink has done a wonderful job. I appreciate working with him and his \nstaff. I think this is a good bill, produced under difficult \ncircumstances. This bill is actually substantially below the current \nfiscal year's spending.\n  The professional staff on the majority side--Virginia James, Leif \nFonnesbeck, Ryan Thomas, Rebecca Benn, and Michele Gordon--have done a \ngreat job. Also, I thank Rachael Taylor on the minority side. And Bruce \nEvans and Peter Kiefhaber, the two clerks, both have done a lot of work \nto get us to this point. I want them to know how much we appreciate \ntheir work.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask for third reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on engrossment of the \namendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n\n\n      Senator Frank R. Lautenberg Casts His 7,000th Rollcall Vote\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the next vote that will be cast by my friend \nfrom New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, the junior Senator from New \nJersey, will be his 7,000th vote.\n  Senator Lautenberg was elected in 1982 to the Senate, and served \nthree terms before taking a ``sabbatical'' in 2000. I repeat, he was \nnot defeated, he took a ``sabbatical.'' He decided to take leave of the \nSenate for a while. He ran again in 2002, when Senator Torricelli \nretired, and the Democrats were desperate for someone who could win in \nNew Jersey. He stepped forward because he is always a sure winner. \nSenator Lautenberg has the rare distinction of having held both of New \nJersey's Senate seats.\n  Senator Lautenberg may be a ``freshman'' of sorts, but the only other \ntwo Senators from New Jersey who have cast more rollcall votes than the \njunior Senator from New Jersey, my friend Senator Lautenberg, are \nHarrison Williams, who cast 8,349 votes over the course of his career, \nand Clifford Case, who cast 7,684 votes. Senator Lautenberg is third, \nhaving cast more votes than Senator Bradley, for example.\n  Senator Lautenberg's parents were poor but hard-working immigrants \nwho came to America through Ellis Island. Senator Lautenberg joined the \nArmy when he was 18 and served in the European Theater during World War \nII. When he returned from the war, he went to Columbia University on \nthe GI bill. Then he and two friends started a payroll company. It was \nvery small. They started from scratch. But they did not just start a \ncompany, they started an entire industry: computer services.\n  Today, that company--that little startup company, ADP--has annual \nsales of almost $8 billion a year, and employs 42,000 people worldwide. \nIt issues the paycheck of one out of every six private sector workers \nin America, and it processes over 850 million investor transactions and \ncommunications every year.\n  After establishing and running one of the most successful businesses \nin America, Senator Lautenberg decided to ``give something back,'' so \nhe became a commissioner at the Port Authority of New York and New \nJersey. Then after serving as a commissioner at the Port Authority of \nNew York and\n\n[[Page S7597]]\n\nNew Jersey, Frank Lautenberg became Senator Frank Lautenberg. Senator \nLautenberg's motto is ``Only in America.''\n  He has done many great things legislatively. They are too many to \nlist here tonight. But one thing I will always look back at, as to what \nthis great Senator did, is what he did for my children. Years ago, when \nwe traveled back and forth across the country, my children were \nallergic to cigarette smoke, literally allergic. They did not like it, \nand the little ones cried. Children in America no longer have to worry \nabout that because of the Senator from New Jersey. He did a favor for \nme--because it made it so much easier on my children--and the rest of \nAmerica.\n  Senator Lautenberg is a great Senator. The people of New Jersey are \nso fortunate this good man, who was financially set, would take public \nservice as his life's work. I so admire him. I know the rest of my \ncolleagues join me in congratulating the ``junior'' Senator from New \nJersey on this significant milestone in an already accomplished career.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Democratic leader for \nthose kind comments. I had hoped he would go on a little longer.\n  (Laughter.)\n  But, in any event, I thank you and all of my colleagues.\n  There are 7,000 votes. If I were asked to recite which of those I \nliked the best or which of those I disliked the most, I would be hard \npressed to remember them. But the fact is, even though we have \ndisagreements on some issues and agreements on others, I speak \nsincerely when I say I am proud to serve with all of you.\n  I know each of us has a responsibility that carries way outside this \nChamber. We make the decisions here. But the desire to be of service \nand the obligation originates in places that we are all too familiar \nwith. So we have differences.\n  I am going to stick up for my views, and I know others will stick up \nfor theirs. The fact is, we are here to serve. I am proud to serve with \neach and every one of you. I am grateful for the commentary and thank \nyou all very much.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, being the junior Senator from New Jersey, \nI must say that of all of the people I have watched live the American \ndream and then believe that it is their obligation to give back--the \ndistinguished minority leader itemized the life of Frank Lautenberg--no \none cares more about that American dream and making sure it is \navailable for his children and all the children of America. I have to \nsay as a colleague but, more importantly, as a friend, I am honored to \nserve with you every day, and I appreciate very much what you have done \nfor the State of New Jersey. I know the people of the State of New \nJersey care very deeply about Frank Lautenberg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, a number of people have asked about the \nschedule. We will have two more votes tonight. We will have a vote on \nfinal passage and then on a motion to proceed to the CAFTA bill. We \nwill be addressing CAFTA tonight, and we will be on it--there are 20 \nhours--tonight and through tomorrow. We will be completing two \nappropriations bills before we leave this week, which means tonight \nwill be busy. We will have no rollcall votes after the two which will \nbe back to back shortly. We will be debating CAFTA through tomorrow, \nand then we will do two other appropriations bills sometime before we \nleave. It means that we may well be here Friday to vote, which we \ntalked about earlier this morning.\n  In addition, as we said this morning, both the Democratic leader and \nI, when we come back after our recess, it is going to be important for \npeople to recognize the huge amount that we have to do. We are \ncompeting with people going back to their States, people who are saying \nwe need to work Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, but not Fridays \nand Mondays because we have other things to do. We are going to have to \nhave people here voting on Mondays when we announce that and also on \nFridays. But with that, we have two votes tonight. They will be back to \nback, and no more rollcall votes after those two.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. I am wondering if we could have unanimous consent that \nthese next two votes be 10 minutes each. Everybody is here--10 minutes \non the first one, 10 minutes on the second one. Then we can move on to \nthe CAFTA bill at that time. I ask unanimous consent that be the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall the \nbill, as amended, pass?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Utah (Mr. Bennett), the Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. \nGregg), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Martinez), and the Senator from \nArizona (Mr. McCain).\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 5 hours to the ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee, Mr. Baucus, and 5 hours to Senator Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Who yields time on the bill?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Tonight the Senate begins its consideration of the Dominican \nRepublic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement \nImplementation Act, more commonly known as CAFTA. I will be speaking in \nsome detail on this trade agreement tomorrow, but for tonight I want to \nopen the debate with some observations about the process that brought \nus here.\n  CAFTA has proved itself to be the most controversial trade agreement \nto come before the Congress since the North American Free Trade \nAgreement a decade ago. It did not have to be this way. When the story \nof CAFTA is written, whether it passes or fails, the theme will be the \npolitics of the last minute because even as we bring this bill to the \nfloor parts of the CAFTA package are still being negotiated. In fact, \nthey are being negotiated as we speak. We need to do better.\n  The Founding Fathers, in their wisdom, assigned primary \nresponsibility for trade policy to the legislative branch. Article I, \nsection 8, clause 3 of the Constitution states:\n\n       The Congress shall have the power . . . to regulate \n     Commerce with foreign Nations.\n\n  It quickly became obvious, however, that Congress is a body ill-\nsuited by structure to negotiate trade agreements. So our predecessors \nquickly figured that the actual negotiating would have to be delegated \nto the executive branch. Still, the constitutional responsibility for \ntrade remains with the Congress. That is why under U.S. law no trade \nagreement is self-executing.\n  Trade agreements such as CAFTA have no force or effect on domestic \nlaw until Congress passes implementing legislation. A system where one \nbranch of the Government negotiates trade agreements and another must \napprove them and turn them into domestic law presents many challenges. \nTo work well, it requires the highest degree of coordination between \nexecutive and legislative priorities.\n  Over the years, this system of shared responsibilities has been \nformalized into Senate procedures commonly called fast trade, or more \nrecently, trade promotion authority. These procedures require the \nexecutive to negotiate agreements that meet a long list of \ncongressional priorities, and they require very close consultation \nbetween the executive and Congress at every stage of the process.\n  I am sure that Ambassador Portman, our current USTR, and his staff \ncan document that they followed these statutory procedures to the \nletter for CAFTA. I do not disagree. Their problem is that process for \nthe sake of process does not work if there is no true spirit of \ncooperation. A statute can require a meeting, but a meeting of the \nminds cannot be mandated by law. A true meeting of the minds is what we \nneed to make the consultive process work the way it is intended to \nwork.\n  Congress and the executive need to be working closely together at \nevery stage of a trade negotiation to make sure that everyone's \npriorities are being addressed, maybe not all agreed to but certainly \nall addressed. Unfortunately, that is not what happened with CAFTA.\n  Early on in the CAFTA negotiations, I could see that sugar was going \nto be a difficult issue so I asked former USTR Ambassador Zoellick to \nmeet with the Senate sugar caucus. That meeting was not required by \ntrade promotion authority, but it made sense to try to address a \ndifficult issue as soon as possible. The meeting took place and views \nwere exchanged, but there was no meeting of the minds and little \nattempt to continue the dialogue. Not surprisingly, CAFTA's sugar \nprovisions were unacceptable to many Members, but CAFTA sat unchanged \nfor more than a year.\n  Suddenly, last week, there began a series of around-the-clock sugar \nnegotiations. Those negotiations were ongoing this morning when the \nFinance Committee marked up CAFTA. They are still ongoing as we speak. \nSo those of us who have sugar producers in our States still do not know \nfor sure what CAFTA means for our constituents.\n  This would have been resolved and should have been resolved months \nago. We should not be on the floor debating an implementation package \nthat is not final. The story is similar for the labor provisions. From \nthe beginning, it was clear that labor rights were going to be a \ncontentious issue in CAFTA. So I, together with a number of colleagues, \nbegan a dialogue with Ambassador Zoellick. We sought assurances that \nCAFTA's labor provisions would be\n\n[[Page S7599]]\n\nstronger than those in other recent free-trade agreements, but little \nprogress was made. Suddenly, within the past few weeks, there began a \nseries of around-the-clock meetings between Ambassador Portman and \nseveral Democratic Senators and Members of the House.\n  Just this morning, as the Finance Committee came together to vote on \nCAFTA, brandnew labor and capacity-building provisions were revealed.\n  We should not be on the floor debating CAFTA when the ink is not yet \ndry on these provisions and nobody really knows what they mean. I know \nthat there is another way. I have seen it work.\n  In the fall of 2003, I put out a series of proposals for \nstrengthening CAFTA's environmental chapter. Ambassador Zoellick and I \nhad a productive yearlong dialogue on these issues. It was very \nconstructive, very rewarding. He was engaged; I was engaged. With \ncommitment on both sides, we agreed on key improvements that are \nincluded in the text of this agreement. This is the model I want to \nfollow in the future, not the last minute dealmaking but the long, \nthoughtful dialogue working to find accommodation, find agreement, \nwhich builds a greater consensus for trade, let alone the agreement in \nquestion.\n  Trade promotion authority expires in 2007. At that time, Congress \nwill consider whether there are ways to improve the process. The truth \nis, the process is only as good as the goodwill of the people using it.\n  I do not say this to lay blame. We are all responsible. Members of \nthe Senate are caught up in the press of business and do not always \nfocus on their priorities early enough in the trade negotiation \nprocess. The executive hears but does not always follow the advice or \npay attention to the advice it receives from Members of the Senate. The \nsame would be the case for House Members.\n  Still, in the end our trade policy is only successful when it \nreflects the priorities of both the Congress and the executive.\n  In the coming months and years, let us rededicate ourselves to the \npurpose behind the process. Let us work together and truly mean it. \nThat is the way we get things done. Again, under the Constitution, \nCongress has primacy in trade, but because we are not a parliamentary \nform of government but a constitutional form of government with \nseparate branches we, by necessity, have to delegate the negotiating of \ntrade agreements to the executive. But to make this work and to \ncontinue to have a consensus and to build a consensus on trade \nagreements, the administration must consider the wishes of Congress \nmuch more seriously in the future. Otherwise, it runs the real risk of \nlosing, perhaps, trade promotion authority for other similar \nagreements.\n  I say this also because we stand at a moment in history, at a time \nwhen the United States has to work much more aggressively, much more \ncooperatively among ourselves, different sectors of the country, to \nmeet the competitive challenges that we face overseas. Whether it is \nChina, Japan, Europe, the flattening of the Earth, or changes in \ntelecommunications technologies, we have to work a lot harder, invest \nmore in education, address the high health care costs that put our \nAmerican companies at competitive disadvantage, and be much more \naggressive in enforcing our trade laws. There are many more actions we \nmust take. When that happens, the more the President and the Congress \nin good faith can totally put politics aside because this is an \nAmerican issue. This is not a partisan issue. This is an issue for \nAmerica. If they were to do so, and we were to do so, we will fulfill \nthe responsibilities we have, and it will help our people at the same \ntime.\n  At the appropriate time, I will later yield time to the senior \nSenator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before I begin my remarks I want to \nthank the Senator from Montana, the ranking Democrat on the committee, \nand the former chairman of the committee for his cooperation and good-\nfaith effort to have the Senate and our committee work to get its job \ndone. Even though he has a different view on this legislation than I \ndo, he has been very cooperative in helping things happen, even though \nhe disagreed. I think it is that spirit that gets things done in the \nSenate. It is kind of the tradition of our committee, but I think it is \nparticularly true of his and my working relationship. So I thank him \nvery much.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I must respond to that gracious statement \nby my good friend from Iowa. No member of this body can be more blessed \nto have a partner to work with in such cooperation and good spirit than \nI. I am lucky--more importantly the Senate is lucky--to have the \nchairman of the Finance Committee. He is a wonderful person to work \nwith. We work very closely together. We are a real team and we think \nthat our States are better for it. We also think that the country is \nbetter served as well.\n  For whatever reason, whether it is true or not, I want to very much \ngive my utmost thanks and compliments to the senior Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator. Following on the spirit of the \nstatement that he made and probably not directly germane to this \ndiscussion, though, is also the fact that too often the public draws \nconclusions that all we do is have partisan fights, Republican and \nDemocrat, and that we are always at each other's throats. I think \npeople, including my constituents in Iowa, get that view because \nconflict makes news. They never hear of the cooperative efforts that we \nhave made.\n\n  In fact, the very week this bill was voted out of committee, we had \nsome differences that were not entirely partisan. There were some \nRepublicans who agreed with Senator Baucus and some Democrats who \nagreed with me on this bill. It was a very narrow margin in our \ncommittee. But that very same week we voted out a bipartisan Energy \nbill on a 20-to-0 vote, which shows one gets a lot of attention and the \nother one doesn't. But I think it shows you can have differences and \nstill make the system work.\n  As you would expect, I have talked about this legislation over a long \nperiod of time. I am glad we are to the point of the Senate \nconsideration of it, so it is no surprise to you or anybody else that I \nsupport what is referred to as the Dominican Republic-Central America-\nUnited States Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act. I am just going \nto shortly call that the Central American Free Trade Agreement or CAFTA \nfor short.\n  The bill before us, then, implements the trade agreement that was \nnegotiated between our executive branch and the leaders of these five \ncountries over the past several months. Our President gets the \nauthority to negotiate through what we call the trade promotion \nauthority legislation, where Congress has the constitutional control \nover international trade; it is our constitutional responsibility. But \nsince it is impossible for 535 Members of Congress to negotiate \nlegislation, we delegate, under strict procedures, the President making \nthose negotiations. These negotiations went on for several months, \nmaybe even over a period longer than a year, and was signed a year ago.\n  Congress then has the responsibility of considering it. In most \ncases, we end up agreeing to it, but we pass these free-trade \nagreements--whether they are bilateral, multilateral or regional--in \nthe form of legislation, so Congress has control over the final product \nand implements our constitutional responsibility through the agreements \nbeing passed by Congress in the form of legislation.\n  That is where we are now: The Senate's final consideration of \nadopting a law that includes the contents of the negotiated agreement \nbetween the United States and these five countries of Central America.\n  This agreement strengthens the ties of friendship, cooperation, and \neconomic growth between our Nation and the growing economies of Central \nAmerica and the Dominican Republic. It is also an agreement that is \nfundamentally in our national economic and security interests. If it \nwere not in our national economic and security interests, obviously we \nwould have no business having our President negotiate it. Or if it were \nnot in our interests and he did negotiate it, the Congress should not \nbe passing it as law.\n  Today, when it comes to the economic interests that we have with this\n\n[[Page S7600]]\n\nlegislation, most imports from the region enter our market duty free. \nThey come from those countries into our market duty free. In contrast, \nexports from the United States to those countries face a myriad of \ntariffs and nontariff barriers in the region. That is where we are now. \nThat is the status quo.\n  I have a chart here that obviously is not going to contain every \nproduct. I am not going to have on the chart every product that goes \nback and forth between our countries. But this chart illustrates, on \nthis side where you see various products--let's say just on grains. I \nwill just go to the first line. We pay now a 10.6-percent tariff to get \nour products into these countries. If those countries were shipping the \nsame product to us, they would be paying zero tariffs.\n\n  Now, with this agreement before the Senate that we are considering, \nwhen it is fully implemented--because some of these are phased in--you \nwill see that we will not have any tariffs that we now pay for getting \nour products into the countries. And of course it has not changed \nanything for them.\n  But this chart shows, if we do not do anything, what the status quo \nis. The status quo is on that side of the chart. It is kind of a one-\nway street. All the advantages are from products coming from Central \nAmerica into America. All of the impediments are against products going \nfrom the United States down to those countries. So on this side of the \nchart, after the legislation is passed, you see a two-way street. You \nsee the status quo has ended.\n  Let's be clear. A vote against this agreement is a vote for the \nstatus quo. It is a vote to maintain unilateral trade and to keep \ntariff barriers to our exports very high. I could say this another way \nby saying that the ``F'' in Central American Free Trade Agreement, the \n``F'' in CAFTA, once we pass it, is really going to make it a Central \nAmerican Fair Trade Agreement.\n  You can see what is unfair to American producers now. What is very \nunfair to American producers now, shipping to those countries down \nthere, becomes a level playing field. It becomes a fair agreement, a \nfair, level playing field.\n  A vote against this agreement is a vote that denies logic. Make no \nmistake, these tariff barriers to our exports are real. They affect \neveryday Americans, maybe not in a way that they know, but when you \nstudy it, you see how it impacts them.\n  Under the status quo, an off-road loader manufactured by Caterpillar \nin Peoria and exported to Costa Rica must pay a 14-percent tariff. This \nis equal to a $140,000 tax on our export. With CAFTA, the tariff goes \nto zero--not tomorrow, but immediately. This is good news then for \nthose UAW workers at Caterpillar, in Peoria, who make this vehicle \nwithin the United States.\n  On another example under the status quo is microchips produced in New \nMexico and/or Oregon face a 10-percent tariff today. With this Central \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement this tariff barrier is eliminated.\n  Under the status quo, manufactured auto parts cannot even sell in the \nCentral American market. You don't get them in. It isn't a question of \nhow high is the tariff; you can't get them into the market. Under \nCAFTA, we will be able to export these manufactured goods to the \nCentral American market. So this means new opportunities for companies \nsuch as CARDONE Industries and their workers in Philadelphia, PA.\n  Under the status quo--in other words, if we didn't pass this \nagreement--DVDs produced across the country would be subject to tariffs \nof up to 20 percent before they can be sold to consumers in Central \nAmerica. But with this agreement becoming law, those DVDs become tariff \nfree, leveling the playing field, being fair to workers in America.\n  The story is very similar for products that I am very much involved \nin, in my State of Iowa, products from U.S. farms. Today, over 99 \npercent of the food and agricultural products that we import from the \nregion of Central America come into the United States duty free, as \nevidenced by the zeroes there on the second column. Meanwhile, our food \nand agricultural exports to Central America are hit with an average 11-\npercent tariff, with some tariffs ranging as high as 150 percent.\n  CAFTA levels the playing field for U.S. farmers. It takes one-way \ntrade and makes that one-way trade into a two-way street. It tears down \nunfair barriers to our agricultural exports. It gives our farmers a \nchance to compete in a growing and vibrant market of 40 million \nconsumers.\n  If anybody thinks that globalization is bad, do you know what they \nare saying? They are saying that the United States ought to concentrate \non selling to Americans. We make up 5 percent of the world's \npopulation; 95 percent of the world's population is outside the United \nStates. That is a market that we need to be competing in. We are an \nexporting nation--agriculture, manufacturing, services. If we are an \nexporting Nation and our market is 95 percent of the people in the rest \nof the world, we have to be playing on that field. This gives us an \nopportunity to play on that field, not with all the other 95 percent of \nthe people in the world, but at least with 40 million of those \nconsumers who live in these five countries.\n  These barriers I have just referred to are real for our U.S. farmers. \nPork producers in my home State of Iowa face import tariffs from 15 \npercent to 40 percent. When we have full implementation of this \nagreement, Iowa producers will be able to export pork products duty and \nquota free.\n  Today, rice producers from across the South must overcome in-quota \ntariff rates of from 15 percent to 60 percent. These tariffs are phased \nout and eventually eliminated under this agreement.\n  Prohibitive tariffs of up to 40 percent lock our beef exports out of \nthe Central American market. This agreement provides immediate duty-\nfree, quota-free access for high-quality U.S. beef, with eventual \nelimination of all tariffs on U.S. beef. And value-added agricultural \nproducts, such as breakfast cereal, will see tariffs reduced from 32 \npercent to zero immediately, providing new opportunities for U.S. \nworkers.\n  The fact is, virtually every major agricultural producer in the \ncountry, in the United States, will benefit from the passage of this \nagreement, including dairy, Vermont; poultry, Arkansas; apples, Oregon \nand New York; barley, Montana; frozen french fries, Maine; nuts, New \nMexico; dried beans, Wyoming. All in all, the total given to us by \neconomists at the American Farm Bureau Federation is an estimated net \ngain to U.S. agriculture of nearly $1.5 billion each year upon full \nimplementation.\n\n  The agreement also opens the services market to U.S. service exports. \nKey sector opportunities include telecommunications, banking, insurance \ndistribution, audiovisual and entertainment, energy, transport and \nconstruction.\n  Our high-tech sector stands to benefit; the Dominican Republic, \nGuatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica, and El Salvador will join the \nagreement and eliminate tariffs on imports of high-technology products, \nthereby saving United States exporters more than $7 million annually on \nimport duties that would be paid today.\n  The agreement goes far beyond reducing important tariffs, putting \ninto place strong investment protections, anticorruption provisions, \nintellectual property protections, strong provisions on labor in the \nenvironment. This agreement is a solid win for the U.S. economy. It is \na solid win also for the neighbors of these Central American countries.\n  For a third time, I say, let's be very clear. The alternative to this \nagreement is nothing but the continuation of the status quo. It is \nunilateral access to our markets and nothing in return for American \nexports. I don't think the status quo is good enough for our farmers \nand our workers. I don't think Congress should vote to keep barriers to \nour exports to these countries high when they can be eliminated. This \nis what this vote on the Central American Fair Trade Agreement is all \nabout. It all boils down to a vote for unilateral trade and the status \nquo or a vote to reduce barriers for our farmers and workers. To me it \nis a very simple answer. Get this agreement passed as fast as we can \nand bring this level playing field for our farmers, our service \nindustries, our manufacturers.\n  Too often, we talk in economic terms about trade. There are other \ncompelling reasons to support this agreement.\n\n[[Page S7601]]\n\nOver 20 years ago, Congress first opened our markets to products from \nCentral America and the Caribbean. Why did we do that? That part of the \nworld was in turmoil. Central America was a region in great political \nand economic upheaval. Civil strife, civil war, and political violence \nwere part of daily life. As a result, too many innocent people lost \ntheir lives and many more lost their livelihood.\n  I have a chart of headlines accurately reflecting that gruesome and \nchaotic violence that was going on at that time. Whether it was \nNicaragua, Honduras, or El Salvador, it was constant conflict. The \nheadlines accurately reflect that violence.\n  So where are we 20 years later? We see a very different Central \nAmerica. Through sustained political and economic engagement with the \nregion, including the continuation of the unilateral trade preferences \nfor over 20 years, the United States of America has helped this part of \nthe world develop a very different story today. Today, that story is \nthat with progressive leadership of these democratic governments, the \npeople of Central America are enjoying the fruits of freedom, the \nfruits of democracy that we would describe as elected governments, \nparticipatory democracy, choice for the voters, and, as a result, \ngenerally stable civil societies.\n  Now we have this situation in Central America. These leaders, who \nmany of us have had an opportunity to meet with, have given us \nconfidence that this sort of leadership will continue in the future, \nbut these leaders want more for their country. They want to cement the \ngains of the last 20 years since the civil wars have ended. They want \nto build a better foundation for that future. Part of that better \nfoundation is the progressive ideas that are articulated in the CAFTA \nagreement. These ideas came not from the United States but from the \nleaders of Central America who first approached us with the idea of \nstrengthening our trade relations at the Quebec Summit of the Americas \nin April 2001.\n  The fact is that passage of CAFTA is good both for our geopolitical \nand economic interests. We have very little to lose. We have much to \ngain with its passage. In contrast, we have much to lose and we have \nlittle to gain if this agreement is defeated.\n  I have a letter displayed from President Carter. He makes the point I \njust made very well. In that letter he recently wrote, saying through \nCAFTA:\n\n       Our own national security and hemispheric influence will be \n     improved with enhanced, improved stability, democracy and \n     development in our poor fragile neighbors in Central America \n     and the Caribbean.\n\n  Continuing from President Carter:\n\n       There are now democratically elected governments in each of \n     the countries covered by CAFTA. In negotiating this \n     agreement, the Presidents of the six nations had to contend \n     with their own companies that fear competition with United \n     States firms. They have put their credibility on the line, \n     not only with this trade agreement but more broadly by \n     promoting market reforms that have been urged for decades by \n     United States presidents of both parties. If the U.S. \n     Congress were to turn its back on CAFTA, it would undercut \n     these fragile democracies, compel them to retreat to \n     protectionism, and make it harder for them to cooperate with \n     the United States.\n\n  The stakes are high. President Carter, being a President with a \nglobal view, saying the stakes are high, lends a great deal of \ncredibility in a bipartisan way--he is a Democrat, I am a Republican--\nto the reasons and rationale behind this. That going beyond the \neconomics of trade to the good that comes from trade.\n  I often say during debates on trade in this body we as political \nleaders, as Senators, our President of the United States, the Cabinet, \nour diplomatic corps, we always think we are negotiating all these \nthings, we are making decisions that are going to bring about world \npeace.\n  Obviously, we set a standard or at least create an environment for \neither a peaceful society or a less peaceful society to exist. Our \nefforts are a spit in the ocean compared to what business men and women \nin America and other countries do in millions of transactions and the \ndialog they have in the process, breaking down, misunderstanding, \ncreating friendship through what they do at their level, their citizen \nlevel of participating much more so than we can.\n  The things that are evidenced by our trade agreements over the last \n50 years--and this is a little part of this 50-year effort to promote \ninternational commerce--have set a stage where business and commerce is \ndoing more to bring about world peace than we as political leaders can \ndo.\n  The United States, I suppose, has about 300 million people now; 40 \nmillion people down there. It is a small part of the world.\n  How do you make progress in peace? You make progress in peace by \ninches, not by miles. This may be a couple inches of helping us down \nthe path to world peace, but we need to take every opportunity we can \nto encourage commerce. Yes, it creates jobs. It creates prosperity. It \nis also going to help bring about greater world understanding.\n  This is a very good agreement. I hope it receives very broad support \nin the Senate. I hope through my views I have helped colleagues \nunderstand the importance of it. I hope those colleagues will join me \nto ensure that we do not undermine the significant progress that has \nbeen made in this region of Central America over the last 20 years and \nto ensure our American exporters can enjoy the benefits of this \nagreement.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be able \nto use such time as I consume from the time under the control of \nSenator Baucus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first of all, I commend our colleague from \nIowa, the chairman of the Finance Committee, and Senator Baucus, the \nranking member from Montana, and the other members of the Finance \nCommittee for their efforts on behalf of the Central America-Dominican \nRepublic Free Trade Agreement, or CAFTA, as it is known by most who \nfollow this debate and discussion.\n  I voted for the motion to proceed. I would have preferred we had a \nlittle more time. I realize we are moving rather quickly on this \nlegislation. I hoped we would have a few more days to work on this \nlegislation, but obviously that is not the case. We are moving ahead \nwith the 20 hours of debate under the procedures as established by the \nCongress to have a fast-track procedure when dealing with trade \nagreements. So we are given the time we have to debate and discuss \nthese matters.\n  I am going to take advantage of this time and lay out for my \ncolleagues and others my interests and my concerns about this matter.\n  First of all, let me say, as someone who has spent almost a quarter \nof a century in this body, I have dedicated a great deal of my service \nto my interest in Latin America, my interest in Central America, and \nthe Caribbean. That interest arose almost 40 years ago when, as a \nrecent graduate from college, I joined John Kennedy's Peace Corps and \ntraveled to the Dominican Republic, where I spent the next 2 years as a \nyoung man in the mountains of what is called the Cordillera Central of \nthe Dominican Republic not far from the Haitian border as a Peace Corps \nvolunteer. I have a deep, deep affection for the people of the \nDominican Republic, the people of Haiti, and the people of the \nCaribbean and Central America.\n  My oldest brother Tom was a professor at Georgetown University for 27 \nyears and taught Latin American diplomatic history and also was our \nAmbassador to the nation of Uruguay and the nation of Costa Rica. Two \nothers of my brothers studied in Mexico. My sisters speak Spanish. My \nmother did as well. There has been a strong interest in my family in \nLatin America for many years.\n  My strong hope and desire, as I rise this evening to talk about this \nagreement, is to be able to be supportive when the vote occurs at the \nend of the 20 hours of debate. I think it is important we try to do \neverything we can to improve the quality of the lives of the\n\n[[Page S7602]]\n\npeople who live in these countries. They have been through an awful lot \njust during my tenure here in this body.\n  For those who were Members of this body back 25 years ago, 24 years \nago, we had some long and extensive debates about the political events \nin Central America. Civil wars raged. In Guatemala, the civil war raged \nfor decades, as a matter of fact, long before I arrived in the Senate. \nYou had civil wars raging in El Salvador, the civil war that went on in \nNicaragua. The economic difficulties in Honduras were tremendous.\n  There has been political turmoil in the Dominican Republic. In fact, \nthe year before I arrived in the Dominican Republic as a Peace Corps \nvolunteer, there had been a minirevolution there, which caused Lyndon \nJohnson to send the USS Boxer off to the coast of the Dominican \nRepublic. The Marines went down in 1965 and, in fact, were still there \nin 1966, when I arrived there as a Peace Corps volunteer, as a young \nman, to work in the mountains of that country.\n  Also, natural disasters have struck. I cannot recount the number of \ntimes they have hit the Dominican Republic and Haiti over the last \nnumber of years. Hardly a year goes by that some tragedy does not occur \nin these countries. Certainly, hurricanes have swept across the Island \nof Hispaniola, which is home to both Haiti and the Dominican Republic. \nI know my colleagues will recall the mud slides in Haiti, where \nliterally thousands have lost their lives.\n  And then there are the repeated hurricanes that have hit Central \nAmerica. I recall going down, in early 1993, after one of those \nhurricanes hit Nicaragua, to work with then-Vice President Gore's wife, \nTipper Gore, trying to clear mud out of schools and impoverished \ncommunities. Bridges were wiped out. Crops were lost. The country was \ndevastated.\n  To put it in brief, without going into long detail, these five \ncountries of Central America and the Dominican Republic--Haiti is not \nincluded in this agreement. I regret that. I wish we were doing \nsomething more about Haiti. This body, a year ago, unanimously adopted \na concessionary agreement with Haiti. Unfortunately, the other body \nrefused to take up the matter. It could have made a difference, in my \nview, to provide some real assistance to people who are so desperately \nin need of help, the island nation of Haiti. It is one of the great \ntragic cases in the world, let alone in this hemisphere, the conditions \nunder which people live there.\n\n  I had hoped we might bring up that concessionary agreement again, \neither as a part of or in conjunction with this CAFTA agreement. The \nirony, in a way, if this agreement is adopted, is that we will be \nproviding some meaningful assistance to the Dominican Republic, which \ninhabits two-thirds of the Island of Hispaniola, and doing virtually \nnothing for one-third of the island where the most desperate conditions \nprevail--in Haiti. But hope springs eternal, and I hope, before this \nCongress adjourns, we will be able to convince the other body that \nthere is a reason to try to do what we can for Haiti.\n  But back to the matter at hand, and that is this agreement affecting \nthe Central American nations and the Dominican Republic. The people of \nthese nations deserve our help, deserve something that will improve the \nquality of their lives. If that does not happen, quite candidly, what \nyou are going to see is what people have done historically. They will \nexpress their feelings with their feet. They will walk. They will move. \nThey will migrate. In many instances, I presume they will come to this \ncountry however they can make it here. We welcome, obviously, \nimmigration. But a flood of immigration, which can occur as a result of \neconomic conditions, in this country is something we ought to be \nmindful of as we consider the implications of this proposal.\n  So again, my hope is to be able to be supportive.\n  Let me outline, if I may, briefly, what my interests are. I had a \nvery good meeting today with Ambassador Portman. I did not know him \nterribly well before, but I was very impressed with him and the team. \nWe spent about an hour in my office discussing this matter. We had a \nvery good meeting at the White House not too many days ago. President \nBush, very graciously, invited a group of us down--I gather he has done \nthat on several occasions now--along with people who are not committed \nto this agreement, to listen to various ideas. I commend him for that. \nI think there is a true desire to try to build strong support for this \nagreement in this body and in the other, if we can.\n  So if I can, Mr. President, very briefly, I would like to lay out my \nconcerns, what I am doing, what I have done today, what I am doing this \nevening, and what I will do tomorrow morning in anticipation of a vote \noccurring either tomorrow or on Friday, with my strong, fervent hope \nthat I will be able to support this agreement. But let me lay out my \nconcerns. As you know, I have long been concerned, as I mentioned, and \ninvolved in all aspects of our policies with respect to the countries \nof Central America and the Dominican Republic. For those of us who were \nserving in this Chamber in the 1980s, we all remember the dark days and \nbitter debates about events in the region at that time and the U.S. \nresponse to them. Happily, those dark days are now behind us. Today, \nthe situation, if you will, in Central America is a far more positive \nand fruitful one. The debate is, of course, how to enhance our economic \nrelations with the region in a manner that benefits the United States \nand our neighbors.\n  I believe there are real possibilities for the CAFTA-Dominican \nRepublic agreement being a vehicle for enhancing those relations and \nstrengthening democratic institutions throughout the region. But I also \nbelieve that, even at this late date, there need to be certain \nunderstandings and clarifications if, in fact, we are going to achieve \nthe very goals the CAFTA-Dominican Republic agreement lays out. Those \nclarifications relate to certain aspects of the agreement, if it is \ntruly going to live up to the expectations the parties have set forth \nin it.\n  Those of us who want to advance respect and adherence to core \ninternationally recognized labor standards were somewhat disappointed \nthat the agreement is a weak instrument for doing so. In fact, it is \nweaker than current provisions under the Caribbean Basin Trade \nPartnership Act, which currently links unilateral trade benefits from \nthe United States to the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act-eligible \ncountries to international workers' rights.\n  I welcome the efforts of Senator Bingaman, our colleague from New \nMexico, to strengthen the capacity of these countries to effectively \nenforce and uphold internationally recognized labor rights. I believe \nthe provision agreed to by the administration, to provide an additional \n$3 million to fund the International Labor Organization programs in \nCAFTA-DR countries, is a step in the right direction.\n  Ambassador Rob Portman has committed, on behalf of the Bush \nadministration, to provide these moneys to the International Labor \nOrganization so the organization can monitor and verify progress in the \nCentral American and Dominican Republic Governments' efforts to improve \nlabor law enforcement and working conditions.\n  To strengthen the effectiveness of the ILO in carrying out its work \nin the region, I believe there needs to be a clear understanding, \nbefore we vote on the CAFTA-DR agreement, of exactly what would be \nentailed in those ILO programs if they are going to be effective. That \nis why I met today with Ambassador Portman and have contacted the \nCAFTA-DR Ambassadors from these countries to describe what I believe is \nneeded to make the ILO initiative meaningful.\n  Let me spell it out, if I can, very briefly. And it is not \nunreasonable and does not require renegotiation in any way.\n  I have requested answers in writing from the affected CAFTA-DR \nGovernments as to whether jointly or severally they would each welcome \nand support ILO efforts to improve labor enforcement and working \nconditions in their countries in relationship to the implementation of \nthe CAFTA-DR agreement. We would support and welcome an active role for \nthe ILO representatives and their countries, including acceptance of \nthe principle that ILO representatives would be granted unfettered \naccess to workplaces, be permitted to establish mechanisms for \nreceiving and investigating\n\n[[Page S7603]]\n\nmatters related to core ILO labor standards, make private \nrecommendations to worker and employer organizations and appropriate \nofficials within each Government, as well as issue periodic public \nreports of its findings on matters of concern related to the \nenforcement of core ILO international labor standards as specified in \nthe International Labor Organization's Declaration on Fundamental \nPrinciples and Rights at Work and its followup adopted by the \nInternational Labor Conference in 1998.\n  I am not breaking new ground here at all. In fact, what I have just \ndescribed is included in other labor and other trade agreements, most \nspecifically the trade agreement with Cambodia which was renewed by the \nBush administration only recently, adhering to the very principles that \nwere negotiated under the Clinton administration. So this is something \nthat has already been accepted.\n  Let me tell you why these provisions are important and why I think \nthey help what we are trying to achieve with this trade agreement. I am \nhopeful the administration and the agreement governments will find this \nclarification useful and acceptable. If so, I believe the CAFTA-DR \nagreement will have made an important contribution to strengthening \ndemocracy in the region and improving the daily lives of their \ncitizens. I await word from them in the coming hours.\n  As I said, I very much want to be able too support this agreement. \nBut I also want to have some confidence that I will be helping to raise \nthe living standards of American and CAFTA-Dominican Republic workers \nand not be an accomplice to a rush to the bottom in weakening working \nconditions in either the United States or elsewhere in the region. Let \nme be clear that we aren't somehow raising the bar on the issue of \nrespect for core labor rights. Existing trade preference programs for \nthe region provide that the President should at least take into account \nthe extent to which beneficiary countries provide internationally \nrecognized workers rights.\n  As currently written, the CAFTA-DR agreement would weaken standards \nthese countries have been living under through the Caribbean Basin \nInitiative and Generalized System of Preferences. Instead of asking \nthem to do more with the CAFTA-DR agreement, we are asking them to do \nless. Moreover, currently the trade benefits can be withdrawn in these \nother countries if a country lowers its labor laws below international \nstandards or simply fails to meet those standards. And they can be \nwithdrawn if a government directly violates internationally accepted \nworkers rights that might not be protected under their laws. But this \nwill not be the case under CAFTA and the Dominican Republic.\n  Let me reemphasize that. Under the Caribbean Basin Initiative \nagreements, we established very well for all involved that \nInternational Labor Organizations labor standards, which are not \nterribly high standards, ought to be enforced collectively. The irony \nwould be that we are now moving away from the very agreement that has \nbeen beneficial to the Caribbean Basin Initiative countries. In fact, \nsome of these countries are obviously under that agreement now, and \nthese standards would be lowered, not enhanced, at a time we have been \ntrying to improve conditions.\n  This is also important to us from an economic standpoint. It has \nalways been our goal with trade agreements with less developed \ncountries to try to create wealth, to be wealth producing in our trade \nagreements. Obviously, this is critically important in the long term \nbecause our higher value goods and our higher value services need to \nhave markets in these underdeveloped countries. If there is not wealth \ncreation in these nations, then how will they ever afford to buy the \nproducts and the services that are higher cost? We have always tried \nto, as part of our trade agreements, improve those standards with a \nlong-term vision that we would be a beneficiary as a result of wealth \ncreation. And also it helps to improve tremendously living standards in \nthe countries with whom we are trading.\n  Moreover, the lack of an objective standard is troubling because it \ncould create a race-to-the-bottom mentality where investors and \ncompanies play governments against each other seeking lower labor \nstandards in a quest for increased profits. That type of situation \nwould wreak havoc on civil society in these countries. At a time when \nwe are trying to promote more civil societies, to strengthen democratic \ninstitutions, it could have the opposite effect. It could cost also \nAmerican workers their jobs. By having one standard that applies to \nall, you avoid the race to the bottom which could occur.\n\n  Let me make the point. Under this agreement each country would set \nits own labor standard, whatever they decided. They are required to \nenforce that labor standard. But there is no requirement of what that \nlabor standard ought to be. For those who have followed events at all \nin these countries and have great affection for them, you don't need to \nhave a PhD to understand there is a lot of difficulty when it comes to \nlabor standards. That is why we have insisted on the ILO standards \nacross the board generally, to try to maintain a more decent level. \nWhen you leave it up to each one of these countries to set their own \nstandards and then only require that they meet them, you are obviously \ninviting the kind of race to the bottom I have just described.\n  For the most part, CAFTA and DR nations have laws on their books, but \nthey face a lack of resources and domestic political opposition from \ninfluential people which prevents them from enforcing these laws. This \nstatement was expressed by U.S. Trade Representative Rob Portman at a \nJune 9, 2005 speech, only a few days ago, that he gave before the \nHispanic Alliance for Free Trade. I commend him for his speech. Let me \nquote it, if I may. In that speech Ambassador Portman said:\n\n       The ILO study demonstrated that the laws on the books are \n     not the main issue. The major problem is that enforcement of \n     those laws clearly needs improvement.\n\n  Ambassador Portman went on to say:\n\n       You can read the State Department's annual human rights \n     report and quickly conclude that enforcement needs to be \n     improved. You can read a recent White Paper published by the \n     Labor Ministers of Central America, who themselves \n     acknowledge that enforcement needs to be improved.\n\n  These are good statements. They are strong statements, and I agree \nwith our ambassador when he makes them. That is all I am suggesting \nwith the language that I have submitted to Ambassador Portman and to \nthe Central American countries earlier this evening. In my opinion, \nenforcement problems are not a result of malice on the part of these \nleaders. I believe that these leaders and these countries want to do \nthe right thing. But I would remind my colleagues that our neighbors to \nthe South are democratic countries. As in all democracies, they have to \ndeal with powerful opposition interests.\n  The administration seems to hold the view that the support for \nexpanded trade and economic growth is incompatible with advocating core \nlabor standards in developing countries. I believe the opposite is the \ncase. In fact, when we have insisted upon better labor standards, we \nend up with a far better trading environment. In case after case after \ncase, when we have insisted on stronger ILO standards, we have had a \nbetter trading relationship. When we have not, it has gone in the \nopposite direction. In fact, experts for the well-respected Institute \nfor International Economics have concluded that ``core labor standards \nsupport sustainable and broadly shared political, social, and economic \ndevelopment.''\n  The operative word here is ``shared,'' shared among citizens, not \nsimply a handful of people who have the resources and the political \ninfluence to effect them.\n  So if this agreement is fixable--and I believe it is--it could be a \nwin-win proposition. I believe it can be, and I hope the administration \nand the CAFTA-DR governments will welcome this fleshing out of the ILO \nrole.\n  Again, I commend Senator Bingaman and Rob Portman and the \nadministration for being willing to sit down at a late hour and to \nwelcome ideas about how we might make this a stronger agreement. I \nthink the votes are probably here to pass an agreement even without \nthese suggestions, but I think it is a better trade agreement if we \nhave the kind of ILO standards I have talked about.\n  Again, I emphasize, I very much want to support this agreement. I \nthink it\n\n[[Page S7604]]\n\nwould make a difference in the long run, not only for our own country \nbut also for these struggling democracies in Central America and the \nDominican Republic. These are good friends. They have been through an \nawful lot. I mentioned earlier the political turmoil and strife, the \nloss of life through civil wars, the natural disasters that have \ncrippled them. They deserve better. They are not going to get it \nthrough foreign aid. I know that. But they could get it through an \nimproved trading relationship, by lowering barriers and working \ncooperatively. My hope is we will do it. There is only a small amount \nof trade between ourselves and these countries. It amounts to very \nlittle in terms of overall trade dollars. But I think we set a standard \nthat could be used throughout the region in the coming years.\n  My hope--even at this late hour, without in any way requiring that we \nreopen the process for negotiation--is that by just requiring that the \nILO would be allowed to actually visit sites in these countries, not \njust the labor ministries, which is what the agreement does right now--\nunder the agreement, the ILO would go to the labor ministry and say: \nAre you complying or not complying. Obviously, we know what the answer \nwill be. You are asking the very people to discipline themselves. \nObviously, they are not likely to conclude that they are not complying. \nBy doing what we did in the Cambodian Free Trade Agreement, in \npermitting the ILO inspectors to actually have site visits to determine \nwhether the laws are being enforced and then, of course, to be able to \nwork with employers as well as employees to try to fix the problem that \nexists there, we do a lot to strengthen this agreement.\n\n  Again, I don't think it is asking too much. It goes a long way to \nmaking this a better and stronger agreement. It will do many good \nthings for the people of these countries. I urge the administration and \nthese CAFTA countries with whom we have been communicating today to \nconsider this language offered. I have had a rather positive response \nso far from several of them, not all of them. My hope is that \nAmbassador Portman, on behalf of the administration, would be willing \nto accept this additional language to be included in correspondence \nalong the lines that was provided to Senator Bingaman.\n  I have drafted a letter to Ambassador Portman that outlines what I \nhave described here this evening. I am not going to include that letter \nin the Record. I would rather Ambassador Portman have a chance to see \nit before it becomes a public document for him to take a measure of it \nand to let me know whether something might be done along the lines we \ndescribed here. I look forward tomorrow to addressing this issue again \nduring further debate. My strong hope would be to be able to stand \nbefore this body and to offer my unconditional support for this \nagreement. I believe what we have offered here is a reasonable \nproposal, one that could be included in this agreement and one that \nwill allow us to have a strong vote.\n  My hope is it would convince some of our colleagues in the other \nChamber who have expressed strong reservations about this agreement to \ncome onboard. Most of the reservations have been focused on the labor \nstandard issue. Again, I think we can strengthen that and convince many \nof our colleagues to support this agreement. The people of these little \ncountries, desperately poor people, deserve better. If democracy is \ngoing to work here, if economic opportunity is to occur, then we ought \nto be doing more.\n  We have trade agreements with big powerful countries. Too often we \nallow too much to slip by and to allow these countries to take \nadvantage of us. These small countries deserve some help and support. \nWe spent $5 billion in the 1980s financing and underwriting a part of \nthe civil war that occurred there. Thousands lost their lives. A great \ndeal of our treasury was expended in Central America. It is time we \nexpended some effort to see these people have a chance for a better \nlife.\n  I think this agreement can do it. A few changes that we have \nsuggested could help us achieve that goal. I look forward to that \nopportunity occurring with a decision by the administration and the \nCAFTA countries.\n  Mr. President, I would like to address the Senate on another matter. \nI want to be careful to make sure no one else wants to be heard on this \nmatter.\n  Let me inquire of the Chair, would it be appropriate for this Member \nto ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That would be appropriate.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              A Free Press\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, two days ago the U.S. Supreme Court refused \nto consider overturning contempt citations against two journalists, \nJudith Miller and Matthew Cooper. This decision by the Court \neffectively paves the way for these two reporters to be sent, possibly, \nto jail. Yesterday the District of Columbia Circuit Court upheld the \nconvictions of four additional journalists for contempt. They may \nappeal to the Supreme Court, but they are justifiably concerned that \nthe Supreme Court will decline to consider their case, just as the \nCourt declined to consider the Miller and Cooper cases the other day.\n  What did those journalists do to deserve criminal contempt \nconvictions? Nothing more than their jobs, in my view. That is, they \ndid nothing more than refuse to reveal to law enforcement officials the \nidentity of sources to whom they had pledged confidentiality.\n  Thomas Jefferson once said that were he to have to choose between a \nfree country and a free press, he would select the latter.\n  He understood--as did the other Founding Fathers--that nothing was \nmore important to a free people than the free flow of information. An \ninformed citizenry is the first requirement of a free, self-governing \npeople.\n  Armed with knowledge, our people can govern themselves and hold \naccountable their elected leaders and other high public and private \nofficials.\n  Today, that principle of a well-informed electorate holding their \nleaders accountable is at risk.\n  Along with the 6 journalists I have just mentioned, there are 20 or \nmore others who have been convicted or face conviction for protecting \nthe confidentiality of their sources. This is an unusually high number \nby historical standards.\n  Senator Lugar and I have introduced legislation, S. 340, the Free \nFlow of Information Act. We are joined in the other body by \nRepresentatives Spence and Boucher. The purpose of this legislation is \nto protect the free flow of information that is so essential to \nmaintaining our free society.\n  This legislation is not about conferring special rights and \nprivileges on members of the Fourth Estate. It is, rather, intended to \nprotect the right of all citizens to inform and be informed--including \nby speaking with journalists in confidence.\n  The bill is hardly radical in concept. It is based on Justice \nDepartment guidelines and on statutes that currently exist in 31 States \nand the District of Columbia. While those State and DC statutes would \nnot be preempted, the bill would establish a uniform Federal standard \nfor Federal cases involving journalists and their sources. It would \nbalance the legitimate and often compelling interest in law enforcement \nwith the critical need in a free society to protect the free flow of \ninformation.\n  It would achieve this balance by protecting the confidentiality of \nsources--while at the same time allowing courts to compel journalists \nto produce information about wrongdoing if that information is \nessential to an investigation and cannot be obtained from other \nsources.\n  Imagine for a moment what would happen if citizens with knowledge of \nwrongdoing could not come forward and speak confidentially with members \nof the press. Serious journalism would virtually cease to exist. \nWrongdoing would not be uncovered. We would never have learned about \nthe crimes known as ``Watergate'' but for the willingness of sources to \nspeak in confidence with reporters.\n  My colleagues, when journalists are hauled into court by prosecutors, \nwhen they are threatened with fines and imprisonment if they do not \ndivulge the\n\n[[Page S7605]]\n\nsources of their information, then we are entering dangerous territory \nfor a democracy, because that is when citizens will fear persecution \nsimply for stepping out of the shadows to expose wrongdoing. When that \nhappens, the information our citizens need to govern will be degraded--\nmaking it more and more difficult to hold accountable those in power.\n  And when the public's right to know is threatened, then all of the \nother liberties that we hold dear are threatened.\n  We are under no illusions as to the difficulty of our task in \nadvancing this legislation.\n  We know that there are those who have a pavlovian response to words \nlike ``reporter'' and may react negatively to this legislation. We also \nunderstand that it is critically important that we balance our Nation's \ncompelling interest in preserving the free flow of information with its \nno less compelling interest in pursuing wrongdoing by criminals and \nothers that would jeopardize the freedoms that we cherish as Americans.\n  Mr. President, again, I am joined by Senator Lugar and my colleagues \nin the House, Congressmen Spence and Boucher. We would like to see some \nlegislation at least be debated on the floor of the Senate and possibly \npassed by both Houses, if we have a chance to debate this.\n  The fact that reporters are going to jail because of their refusal to \nidentify confidential sources ought to raise the concerns of everyone, \nregardless of their ideology or politics. We all understand there is a \ndanger in this if we lose what has been critical as part of our self-\ngovernance. This evening, with two reporters we know facing very \nserious jail sentences, with others who may face similar sentences, \nwith some 20 other people who have either been convicted or presently \nare in the process, we think it is very important that we act in this \nmatter. We know it is not necessarily popular. This is not about \nreporters, it is not about the press, it is about whether the citizenry \nis going to have access to information they deserve to get. It is not \nabout protecting journalists or sources if that is the only way we can \nget information we need to pursue criminal prosecutions. It ought not \nto be the first arrow drawn out of the prosecutor's quiver trying to \ndeal with these matters. Too often that happens. They need to work \nharder to get to the bottom of these cases, without dragging the \nreporters in front of these courts.\n  I hope our colleagues on both sides of the aisle--conservatives, \nliberals, independents, moderates, or whatever--would be able to come \ntogether around this idea that in a free society of the 21st century \nthe confidentiality of sources is something we ought to be willing to \nstand up and support. I urge my colleagues to consider this legislation \nand the leadership to put it on the calendar.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/29/senate-section/article/S7605-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7605]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak to a resolution I \nwill submit honoring a true champion. I rise today out of two \naffections in my life: one for the land of New Zealand, and another \ngrows out of my enjoyment of the game of golf.\n  Ten days ago, on June 19, Michael Campbell became the first New \nZealander to win one of the United States Golf Association's major \nchampionships in 43 years, besting a field of the world's most talented \ngolfers.\n  Mr. Campbell showed great perseverance and mettle throughout the \nOpen, mastering an immensely challenging course. He was also the first \nplayer to come from behind to win a U.S. Open in 7 years.\n  Mr. Campbell's win is yet another chapter in a proud tradition of \nexcellence in international sports for New Zealand.\n  The Kiwis have won two of the last three America's Cup yacht races \nand netted three gold and two silver medals at last summer's Olympic \nGames in Athens.\n  The competitive spirit and success of these athletes is reflective of \nthe bravery and skill of New Zealand's indigenous seagoing explorers, \nthe Maori, of whom Michael Campbell is a descendent.\n  Mr. Campbell's victory in the U.S. Open also provides us with the \nopportunity to reflect on our relationship with New Zealand and at the \nsame time to shape the future of our friendship.\n  Staunch allies in the two World Wars in the 20th century, New Zealand \nand its people have made tremendous sacrifices and heroic efforts to \nhelp protect freedom and democracy in the world.\n  Those efforts continue today, as New Zealand contributes regularly to \ninternational peacekeeping operations, remains steadfast in their \nalliance in the fight against terrorism, and has helped to reconstruct \na new, democratic Iraq.\n  Even though there have been some bumps in the road--the deterioration \nof the Australia-New Zealand-United States alliance comes to mind--New \nZealand has been a great friend and an enduring ally over the years.\n  It is my hope that we will continue to foster this friendship.\n  On that note, I commend Michael Campbell and the nation of New \nZealand for this momentous victory and express arohanui to the peoples \nof Aotearoa, our friends in the Land of the Long White Cloud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/29/senate-section/article/S7605-3", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7605-S7608]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ENERGY POLICY ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, yesterday I was necessarily absent from the \nSenate during final passage of H.R. 6, the Energy bill. I was attending \nthe funeral of Mrs. Marcia Lieberman, the mother of my good friend and \nour colleague, Senator Lieberman. Had I been here, I would have voted \nfor the bill, albeit with considerable reservations.\n  I commend the chairman and ranking member for their hard work in \ncrafting a bipartisan bill. But let me be clear, this bill is not \nperfect. All things being equal, it seeks to balance the economic needs \nof our country with the well-being of our environment and sets out a \npolicy to provide Americans with a reliable and affordable supply of \nenergy.\n  Overall, the Senate Energy bill is a more balanced approach to energy \ntax policy than the House bill. It provides just under 50 percent of \nthe tax incentives to renewable energy and energy-efficient buildings, \nhomes and appliances. Unfortunately, the bill also provides 50 percent \nof tax incentives to mature industries such as oil, gas, coal and \nnuclear.\n  The bill now includes a renewable portfolio standard, by which \nelectric utilities must generate 10 percent of their power from \nrenewables by 2020. In the past, I voted for a higher percentage \nbecause I believe our Nation can and should use even more renewable \nenergy. However, the bill begins a smart, economic, and environmentally \nfriendly path for this country to take and I am pleased that the Senate \nacted.\n  For the first time, the Senate is on record in acknowledging the \nexistence of global warming and recognizing the need to take mandatory, \nmarket-based steps to slow, stop or reverse the growth of greenhouse \ngas emissions. It is a start, a baby step, but again, it puts this \ncountry on the right path and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to determine the right proposals to combat these emissions. \nAir pollution must be reduced. Long-term exposure to toxic emissions \nand unhealthy air has been linked to increased risk of cancer, reduced \nlung function in children, and premature death of people with heart and \nlung disease. Asthma rates in Connecticut are over two and a half times \nthe national average; 7.9 percent of adults and 8.9 percent of children \nunder age 18 in Connecticut have asthma.\n  I am pleased the Senate included an amendment that I offered to study \nthe\n\n[[Page S7606]]\n\neffect of electrical contaminants on the reliability of energy \nproduction systems, including nuclear power facilities. In April, 2005, \nthe Millstone 3 nuclear power plant in Waterford, CT, automatically \nshut down and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, NRC, determined the \ncause to be a failure of a circuit card in a computerized reactor \nprotector system. It was revealed that ``tin whiskers'' were present on \nthe circuit card which led to the subsequent shutdown. Earlier this \nyear, the January 10, 2005, edition of Fortune magazine had a lengthy \narticle entitled, ``Tin Whiskers: the Next Y2K Problem?'' The article \nexplained the seriousness of this problem.\n  Finally, I am just as pleased with a few items that were not included \nin the Senate bill. Unlike the House, this bill does not grant \nretroactive liability to producers of MTBE, a gasoline additive that my \nhome State of Connecticut has already banned. I urge my colleagues to \nkeep this provision out of the conference report. There is no explicit \nopening of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, although there are \nattempts to open that pristine land through other pieces of \nlegislation. Finally, the Senate bill steers clear of removing \nenvironmental protections from the Safe Drinking Water Act and the \nClean Water Act. Nor does the bill reduce environmental review for \nenergy projects.\n  I am disappointed that H.R. 6 includes language to inventory the \nOuter Continental Shelf, OCS, including what is currently covered by a \n23-year moratorium. Since 1982, Congress and the executive branch have \nprohibited new offshore leases in the OCS. While an inventory sounds \nbenign, it is a costly endeavor that will cause irreparable harm to our \ncoastal waters and could well set us on a slippery slope to drilling \nand exploration in these environmentally sensitive areas.\n  I am also troubled by section 381 of the underlying Senate bill that \npreempts state authority and gives exclusive authority to the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission, FERC, with regard to the siting, \nconstruction or expansion of liquified natural gas terminals. I \nunderstand the need for increasing our supply of natural gas, but I \nhave grave concerns over the process for siting LNG facilities. This \nhits close to home because there is a proposal to place a 1,200 foot \nlong, 180 foot wide, 100 foot high LNG facility within Long Island \nSound. FERC authority is also augmented by authorizing it to site \ntransmission facilities in certain areas if a State fails to act within \none year. Again, every State's authority is undercut by this provision.\n  I am deeply concerned that the bill terminates FERC's proposed \nrulemaking for Standard Market Design, SMD, while doing nothing to \naddress FERC's actions with regard to Locational Installed Capacity, \nLICAP. My attempts to insert a simple sense of the Senate amendment to \nclarify that governors and utility regulators throughout New England \nare opposed to LICAP and FERC should take their concerns and \nalternative proposals into account before a final ruling in September, \nwere refused. The theoretical purpose of LICAP is to set prices that \nwill provide an economic incentive for construction of new generation \nwithin New England. However, as proposed by FERC, LICAP will cost \nratepayers more than $14 billion over 4 years without any guarantee \nthat new generation will be built, with no penalty for not building new \ngeneration, and with no provision for refunding payments if no \ngeneration is built. I will continue to work with my colleagues to \naddress this unfair situation.\n  Finally, on the day after the price of a barrel of crude oil topped \n$60 for the first time, we must recognize that this Energy bill does \nvirtually nothing to stem the tide of rising oil, gasoline, and heating \noil prices. The majority defeated efforts to even urge the \nadministration to divert oil from filling the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve, SPR, and to release oil from the SPR through a swap program.\n  I urge my colleagues participating in the conference to stand firm on \nthe will of the Senate and return an energy conference report that \nmoves our country on the path to energy security.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, last Thursday, June 23, the full Senate \nvoted to pass amendment No. 825, the small business and farm energy \nemergency relief amendment of 2005, to the Energy bill, H.R. 6. I thank \nmy colleagues for supporting my amendment. I want to also thank the \ncosponsors, Senators Reed, Snowe, Kohl, Levin, Baucus, Jeffords, \nHarkin, Pryor, Schumer, Lautenberg, Kennedy, and Lieberman.\n  Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is to help small \nbusinesses and small farms struggling to make ends meet with the record \nhigh cost of energy--natural gas, heating oil, gasoline, propane, \nkerosene. We can do this very easily by making those small businesses \neligible to apply for low-cost disaster loans through the Small \nBusiness Administration's Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program. To \nhelp small farms and agricultural businesses, Senator Kohl has included \na provision making them eligible for loans through a similar loan \nprogram at the Department of Agriculture. It also includes a provision \nby Senator Levin, passed unanimously last time this was considered in \nCommittee and the full Senate to promote the use of alternative energy \nsources.\n  The need for this type of safety net is clear. The volatile and \nsignificant rise in cost for these fuels over the past several years \nhas threatened the economic viability and survival of many small \nbusinesses. For example, last week the spot price for oil hit a record \nhigh of $58.90, a cost when adjusted for inflation that has not been \nseen in over 20 years. This is raising the price of gasoline, with the \naverage U.S. price now at $2.16 per gallon, an increase of 22 cents \ncompared to last year. The cost of home heating oil has jumped as much \nas 45 percent, and the natural gas market is likely to tighten over the \nnext few months as summer cooling demand picks up. Prices are projected \nto continue to increase as the winter heating season boosts natural gas \ndemand.\n  As we've heard in testimony after testimony, these prices hurt small \nmanufacturers that rely heavily on natural gas and cite energy costs as \none of the top three factors driving them out of business. These prices \nhurt farmers that rely on natural gas and propane and gasoline to run \ntheir farms and produce crops. And these prices hurt small heating fuel \ndealers in the northeast.\n  Most small companies typically have small cash flows and narrow \noperating margins and simply don't have the reserves to compensate for \nsignificant and unexpected spikes in operating costs. For those \nbusinesses financially harmed by the energy prices, they need access to \ncapital to mitigate or avoid serious losses or going out of business. \nCommercial lenders typically won't make loans to these small businesses \nbecause they often don't have the increased cash flow to demonstrate \nthe ability to repay the loan.\n  There has been a bipartisan push for this assistance in Congress \ntwice in the past few years. In the 107th Congress, in 2001, I \nintroduced virtually the same bill, S. 295, and was joined by 34 \ncosponsors to pass it in the full Senate. Of those who voted to pass \nthe bill, 77 are still in the Senate, including 37 Republicans. Most \nrecently, in November, during the consideration of the mega funding \nbill, the fiscal year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations conference report, \nSenator Reed, as head of the Senate Northeast-Midwest Coalition, worked \nto have a version of this amendment adopted as part of the the bill. \nSeventeen Senators signed a letter to chairmen Stevens and Gregg, and \nranking members Byrd and Hollings requesting its inclusion. It makes no \nsense, but out of 3,000 pages of legislation and almost $400 billion in \nspending, this assistance was not included because the administration \nobjected. The little guy was not helped.\n  As frustrating as that is, and while it would have been most helpful \nto these businesses--from small heating oil dealers to small \nmanufacturers--to enact the legislation in November when the prices \nwere at an all-time high, we can still be helpful now.\n  In that spirit, along with my colleagues mentioned earlier, I am very \npleased to have offered the Small Business and Farm Energy Emergency \nRelief Act of 2005, S. 269, as an amendment to that energy bill. I ask \nmy colleagues in the Senate and House to preserve the provision in the \nfinal bill--conference--as they work out differences between the two \nsides.\n\n[[Page S7607]]\n\n  Mr. President, we have built a very clear record over the years on \nhow this legislation would work and why it is needed. I am glad that my \ncolleagues have gotten behind this bill and have put us one step close \nto making this law in the near future. In the past, this assistance has \nreceived bipartisan support and I am glad that this year is not \ndifferent.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a bipartisan letter of support \nand a copy of the cosponsors from past bills be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Demonstrating Bipartisan Support Over Years\n\n       List of S. 295 cosponsors: Senators Bond, Lieberman, Snowe, \n     Bingaman, Landrieu, Johnson, Domenici, Levin, Wellstone, \n     Jeffords, Harkin, Schumer, Clinton, Kohl, Edwards, Leahy, \n     Baucus, Collins, Dodd, Chafee, Bayh, Kennedy, Inouye, \n     Daschle, Akaka, Corzine, Reed, Murray, Cantwell, Cleland, \n     Enzi, Torricelli, Smith, and Specter.\n       List of those who voted to pass S. 295 and are still in the \n     Senate: Senators Allard, Allen, Bennett, Biden, Boxer, \n     Breaux, Brownback, Bunning, Burns, Byrd, Campbell, Carnahan, \n     Carper, Cochran, Conrad, Craig, Crapo, Dayton, DeWine, \n     Dorgan, Durbin, Ensign, Feingold, Feinstein, Fitzgerald, \n     Frist, Graham, Gramm, Grassley, Gregg, Hagel, Hatch, Helms, \n     Hutchinson, Hutchison, Inhofe, Kyl, Lincoln, Lott, Lugar, \n     McCain, McConnell, Mikulski, Miller, Murkowski, Nelson, \n     Nelson, Nickles, Reid, Roberts, Rockefeller, Santorum, \n     Sarbanes, Sessions, Shelby, Smith, Smith, Stabenow, Stevens, \n     Thomas, Thompson, Thurmond, Voinovich, Warner, and Wyden.

Hollings,\n     Ranking Member, Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, \n         Justice, State and the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Stevens, Byrd, Gregg and Hollings: We are \n     writing to request you include a provision in the fiscal year \n     2005 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report to make heating \n     oil distributors and other small businesses harmed by \n     substantial increases in energy price eligible for Small \n     Business Administration (SBA) disaster loans. Many small \n     businesses are being adversely affected by the substantial \n     increases in the prices of heating oil, propane, kerosene and \n     natural gas. The recent volatile and substantial increases in \n     the cost of these fuels is placing a tremendous burden on the \n     financial resources of small businesses, which typically have \n     small cash flows and narrow operating margins.\n       Heating oil and propane distributors, in particular, are \n     being impacted. Heating oil and propane distributors purchase \n     oil through wholesalers. Typically, the distributor has 10 \n     days to pay for the oil. The money is pulled directly from a \n     line of credit either at a bank or with the wholesaler. Given \n     the high cost of heating oil, distributors' purchasing power \n     is much lower this year compared to previous years. In \n     addition, the distributors often do not receive payments from \n     customers until 30 days or more after delivery; therefore, \n     their financial resources for purchasing oil for customers \n     and running their business are limited. Heating oil and \n     propane dealers need to borrow money on a short-term basis to \n     maintain economic viability. Commercial lenders typically \n     will not make loans to these small businesses because they \n     usually do not have the increased cash flows to demonstrate \n     the ability to repay the loan. Without sufficient credit, \n     these small businesses will struggle to purchase the heating \n     fuels they need to supply residential customers, businesses \n     and public facilities, such as schools. These loans would \n     provide affected small businesses with the working capital \n     needed until normal operations resume or until they can \n     restructure to address the market changes.\n       SBA's disaster loans are an appropriate source of funding \n     to address this problem. The hurricanes that caused \n     significant damage to the Gulf Coast along with the current \n     instability in Iraq, Nigeria and Russia caused a surge in the \n     price for oil and important refined products, especially \n     heating fuels. The conditions restricting these small \n     businesses' access to capital are beyond their control and \n     SBA loans can fill this gap when the private sector does not \n     meet the credit needs of small businesses.\n       A similar provision passed the Small Business Committee and \n     Senate with broad bipartisan support during the 107th \n     Congress when these small businesses faced substantial \n     increase in energy prices. In addition, there is precedence \n     for this proposal as a similar provision was enacted in the \n     104th Congress to help commercial fisheries failures.\n       Thank you for your consideration. Please find enclosed \n     suggested draft language for the proposal. If your staff has \n     questions about the proposal or the impacts of the current \n     energy price increases on small businesses, please ask them \n     to contact Kris Sarri at 224-0606.\n           Sincerely,\n         Jack Reed, John F. Kerry, Arlen Specter, Christopher J. \n           Dodd, Edward M. Kennedy, James M. Jeffords, Evan Bayh, \n           Susan M. Collins, Jeff Bingaman, Patrick J. Leahy, \n           Lincoln D. Chafee, Frank Lautenberg, Joseph I. \n           Lieberman, Charles E. Schumer, Paul S. Sarbanes, \n           Hillary Rodham Clinton, Barbara A. Mikulski.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. President, I wish to explain my climate change votes. \nThis is an important debate, and I appreciate the efforts of my \ncolleagues to contribute substantively to our understanding of the \nissue and to offer solutions.\n  First, let me be clear that although I voted for Senator Hagel's \namendment relating to the promotion of climate change technology at \nhome and abroad, I do not think that amendment goes far enough to \naddress the issue of rising greenhouse gas emissions. At the very \nleast, I would like to see more aggressive timetables and proposals for \nFederal action than are contained in Senator Hagel's amendment.\n  At the same time, I am still not comfortable supporting the approach \nof Senator Lieberman and Senator McCain. I admire their hard work and \ndedication in advocating for immediate action to control U.S. emissions \nof greenhouse gases. They have helped to educate their colleagues, and \nhave kept the issue on the front-burner in the Senate and made it \nimpossible for us to ignore. And, as they have so often pointed out, \nthe evidence that manmade greenhouse gas emissions are impacting our \nclimate system is growing every year.\n  However, I am still not ready to support the mandatory cap and trade \ncalled for in their amendment that would freeze U.S. emissions of \ngreenhouse gases at 2000 levels in 2010. I still have questions about \nthe costs this proposal would impose on our economy, and in particular \non my state that has the largest coal reserves in the lower 48. \nProjections vary widely, which makes it difficult to weigh costs and \nbenefits. I also have concerns about whether we currently--or will in \nthe immediate future--have the technological capabilities to meet the \nchallenges of the McCain-Lieberman bill, without imposing significant \ncosts on our economy or creating greater volatility in natural gas \nmarkets than already exists. Perhaps not in the short term, but beyond \n2010, this concern only grows.\n  These are not trivial questions, particularly when some of our \nfriends in the developing world will soon eclipse the industrialized \nnations as the largest emitters of greenhouse gases. We cannot ignore \nthat fact, particularly as we contemplate placing a burden on our own \neconomy that could impact our international competitiveness, while at \nthe same time, will have little impact on overall global greenhouse gas \nconcentrations.\n  I also was unable to support Senator Bingaman's sense of the Senate, \ncalling on Congress to implement a mandatory program to reduce \nemissions of greenhouse gases soon. While I do agree that Congress \nshould take this issue seriously and act sooner rather than later, I \ncan't agree at this point that we are ready to enact a purely mandatory \nprogram in the short term.\n  Crafting truly bipartisan, comprehensive legislation to address \ngreenhouse gas emissions will take a great deal of work that this \nCongress to date has avoided, except for the concerted efforts of \nindividual Senators, like Senators McCain, Lieberman, Bingaman, Byrd \nand Hagel. Unfortunately, individual efforts generally are not enough \non legislation this complex and far-reaching without the structure and \nsupport of a committee-led process, and encouragement from the \nleadership and the administration.\n  This must happen, and I have been encouraged to hear many of my \ncolleagues express similar sentiments about pursuing a broader approach \nto developing climate change legislation,\n\n[[Page S7608]]\n\nrather than on an ad hoc basis on the Senate floor, particularly the \nChairman of the Senate Energy Committee, Senator Domenici. This is a \npositive development.\n  Congress must act, and act in a concerted, thoughtful way. That's how \nwe have addressed complicated environmental legislation in the past, \nincluding the Clean Air Act. But, we're talking about a potential \nregulatory scheme that could dwarf the scope and impact of even the \nClean Air Act and is directly related to our future economic growth. \nWe're also talking about controlling a gas--CO2--for which we currently \nhave no widely available, proven control technology. Implementing \nmandatory controls now looks to a certain extent like stepping off a \ncliff and hoping something breaks our fall. We need to take the time to \ndo it right. I pledge my assistance to make this happen.\n  I also continue to believe that this administration must re-engage \nwith the international community in a meaningful way. The best way to \nmove forward in this body is concurrently with an international effort \nthat encompasses all of the major greenhouse gas emitters--and those \nthat will soon become the major emitters. Not only will this accelerate \nthe technology development curve, but it will level the economic \nplaying field. The fact that Kyoto left out much of the developing \nworld, including China and India, was that treaty's fatal flaw. We \ndon't need to go down that path again, and I think the world is ready \nto step beyond Kyoto.\n  As the current number one emitter of greenhouse gases, it is \nincumbent on the U.S. to lead, not follow, in this effort. That's why I \nsupported Senator Kerry's sense of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/29/senate-section/article/S7608-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7608-S7609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   INDIAN HEALTH CARE IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to explain \nmy action today related to S. 1239, a bill to amend the Indian Health \nCare Improvement Act. Today, with great reluctance, I asked Leader \nFrist to inform me before entering any unanimous consent agreements \nrelated to consideration of this bill, which the Indian Affairs \nCommittee reported by voice vote this morning.\n  S. 1239 would pencil the Indian Health Service, IHS, an Indian tribe, \na tribal organization, or urban Indian organization to pay the monthly \npart D premium of eligible Medicare beneficiaries. The bill defines \neligible beneficiaries as individuals who are Indian and who are \neligible for the part D prescription drug benefit, but who do not \nreceive any additional financial assistance made available under the \nMedicare Modernization Act of 2003, MMA, to beneficiaries with limited \nincomes.\n  I am all for providing assistance in paying premiums for \nbeneficiaries in financial need. We devoted a lot of time to those \nprovisions in the MMA. I am troubled, however, that as currently \ndrafted, S. 1239 would permit the IHS, an Indian tribe, tribal \norganization, or urban Indian organization to pick and choose who will \nget premium assistance. Specifically, the bill would allow them to \nconsider an eligible beneficiary's ``expected drug utilization'' and \nany other factors to determine the cost-effectiveness of paying the \nbeneficiary's premium.\n  This provision might be an attempt to reflect that the IHS, tribes, \nand tribal organizations have limited resources. The bill language, \nhowever, raises a number of questions. First, how would the IHS and \ntribes determine expected drug utilization or cost-effectiveness? Would \nit be based on the number of drugs a person takes or the severity of \nillness? Second, how would they account for the fact that a \nbeneficiary's drug needs could change dramatically with just one \nillness? That is the point of having insurance.\n  When we crafted the MMA, we were keenly aware of the potential for \nadverse selection--meaning that beneficiaries might wait until they \nneed part D coverage to enroll in part D. This would have the effect of \ndriving up the cost of the part D premium for all beneficiaries. The \nadditional considerations currently included S. 1239 set a dangerous \nprecedent by seemingly promoting adverse selection in the part D \nprogram. This is exactly opposite to what we sought to achieve in the \nMMA.\n  Mr. President, I welcome the opportunity to work with the sponsors of \nS. 1239, Senators McCain, Dorgan, and Baucus, and with members of the \nIndian Affairs Committee on this matter. I had hoped to accomplish that \nbefore the bill was reported out of committee. Unfortunately, that did \nnot happen. I do not take actions such as these lightly. But I am \ndeeply troubled that as currently drafted, S. 1239 could end up having \nunintended consequences for the very people it is intended to assist \nand for all Medicare beneficiaries.\n\n\n                        COMBAT METH ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am proud to add my name today as a \ncosponsor of the Combat Meth Act of 2005, S. 103. I want to thank \nSenator Talent and Senator Feinstein for their leadership on this \nissue. I have had the opportunity to work with my colleagues on a new \nversion of the bill that I understand will be offered in the Judiciary \nCommittee as a substitute when the bill is marked up, and I am very \npleased to support this new version of the Combat Meth Act.\n  Meth is a highly addictive and particularly destructive drug that can \nbe manufactured from widely available household items. In the last 5 \nyears, the use of this terrible drug has skyrocketed, both nationally \nand in my home State of Wisconsin. When I talk to prosecutors and \npolice officers from Wisconsin, they consistently tell me that meth use \nis the most daunting problem they are facing. They tell me that meth is \nthe single most harmful drug--to addicts, families, children, \ncommunities, and the environment--that they have ever dealt with. This \nbill gives law enforcement officials a chance to stem the growing tide \nof meth use by restricting access to the cold medicines that are \ncommonly used to make meth and by providing funds for programs that \nhave been shown to combat the meth problem. The bill targets those who \npurchase over-the-counter drugs for the purpose of manufacturing meth, \nwhile still allowing law-abiding Americans to have adequate access to \nthe cold medicines they need.\n  Methamphetamine is derived from pseudoephedrine, a chemical that is \nfound in most common cold medicines. Meth ``chefs'' can manufacture the \ndrug by buying large quantities of cold medicine, mixing it with other \ncommon chemicals, and heating it. This process can occur nearly \nanywhere and requires only limited knowledge and experience. Even \nbeginners can easily manufacture this drug.\n  Given how easy it is it make, it is not surprising that meth use has \nbeen increasing rapidly. A recent report from the National Institute on \nDrug Abuse finds that meth use has swept across the country, starting \nin Southern California and moving steadily eastward. The situation has \nbecome particularly dire in the Midwest, where meth use accounts for \nmore than 90 percent of all drug prosecutions. Literally millions and \nmillions of individuals have reported using meth--and this trend shows \nno signs of slowing. Meth cases in my home State of Wisconsin have gone \nup 500 percent in just the last 4 years, from 101 prosecutions in 2000 \nto 545 in 2004. And Wisconsin is doing much better than many other \nMidwestern States thanks to proactive efforts by state officials in the \nlate 1990s, before meth had taken hold, to educate communities about \nthe dangers of meth and the need for prevention. These education and \nprevention efforts paid off, keeping the number of meth labs relatively \nlow in Wisconsin compared to neighboring States, but the problem \nremains a very serious one.\n  Both the manufacture and the use of meth have devastating \nconsequences for users and those around them. In the short-term, even \noccasional meth use leads to a whole host of physical and psychological \nproblems. It causes inflammation of the heart lining, increasing the \nrisk of heart attacks and strokes. It causes damage to the nervous \nsystem and creates abscesses on the skin. It also attacks the brain, \nleading to bouts of paranoia, anxiety, and insomnia.\n  Meth's long-term effects are even more destructive. It has highly \naddictive properties, quickly turning occasional users into desperate \naddicts. Meth addicts often go for days without eating or sleeping. \nThey suffer from a variety of heart ailments and can sustain permanent \nand often irreversible\n\n[[Page S7609]]\n\nbrain damage. The drug's effect on the brain also leaves addicts \nvulnerable to the entire spectrum of mental health problems, from \nparanoia and depression to aggression and psychosis. And the drug's \nchemical effects are particularly insidious, meaning that addicts often \nrequire extended detoxification periods before they can begin \ntreatment.\n  Sadly, meth's harmful effects are not confined to its users. The \nprocess of manufacturing meth creates unique environmental hazards that \ncan poison surrounding communities. Cooking the chemicals that create \nmeth can lead to explosions, fires, and the release of noxious gases. \nRemnants from the procedure are often washed down the drain or dumped \nin the ground, where they can contaminate local water sources.\n  Another related danger of significant meth use in a community is an \nincreased crime rate. Meth addicts often resort to violence to gain \naccess to the materials they need or to the money they must have to \nsustain their addiction. Additionally, people who are high on meth are \ndisposed to aggressive and violent behavior. The results are apparent. \nFor example, local news reports indicate that Eau Claire County in \nWisconsin, which has been hard hit by the meth problem, has seen a \nsignificant increase in meth-related crimes as meth use has become more \nprevalent. This drug does not just poison users; it can affect entire \ncommunities.\n  And in the unkindest cut of all, children who are exposed to meth \nmanufacturing or use can be scarred for life. Children of meth addicts \nare exposed to toxic fumes and volatile chemicals, resulting in \npotentially serious health problems, and they are often abused or \nneglected by those in the throes of addiction.\n  This problem calls for immediate Federal action. When Oklahoma was \nthe first State earlier this year to pass a law that successfully \nrestricted access to pseudoephedrine, the sale of products containing \npseudoephedrine grew noticeably in neighboring States. The Oklahoma \nexperience shows that States acting alone cannot address what has \nbecome a national meth problem. We need a law that creates national \nstandards for the sale of products containing pseudoephedrine and puts \nthe resources of the Federal Government behind the effort to stop meth \nuse.\n\n  The new version of the Combat Meth Act provides the national response \nthat we need. It attacks the meth problem at all stages of the process: \nIt gives State and local officials the tools they need to prevent the \nsale of products used to make meth, to investigate and prosecute meth \nmanufacturers, and to treat meth addicts and protect the children they \nharm.\n  This bill helps prevent meth use by restricting the sale of \ningredients needed to manufacture meth. Under the new bill, cold \nmedicines that contain pseudoephedrine will be placed behind pharmacy \ncounters and purchasers will only be able to buy 7.5 grams of the \nproduct per month--more than enough for people who really need the \nmedicine but not enough for those who are buying the medicine to make \nmeth. It requires people purchasing pseudoephedrine products to sign a \nwritten log, but I am pleased that the new version of the bill ensures \nthe privacy of this potentially sensitive medical information by \nallowing the information to be used only to find individuals who might \nbe purchasing these products to make meth. The bill also provides \nfunding to States to monitor the sale of products containing \npseudoephedrine.\n  The Combat Meth Act gives States the resources they need to bring \nmeth manufacturers to justice. It provides money for training programs \nfor State and local law enforcement and expands the scope of currently \neffective meth investigation and clean-up programs. Once meth producers \nand traffickers are found, this bill helps put them behind bars by \nhiring additional Federal prosecutors, training local prosecutors in \nFederal and State meth laws, and cross-designating local prosecutors as \nSpecial Assistant U.S. Attorneys, allowing them to bring legal action \nin Federal courts.\n  While this bill strengthens enforcement and prosecution measures, it \nalso recognizes that most meth addicts require treatment rather than \nharsh criminal sanction. To that end, the bill authorizes the creation \nof a meth treatment assistance center, which will help states learn how \nto effectively treat those who suffer from this awful addiction. And \nfor this drug's most innocent victims--the children who are exposed to \nmeth by the users around them--the bill provides a $5 million grant to \nallow Federal, State, and local entities to work together to help \nassist and educate children who have been harmed by a family member's \nmeth addiction.\n  The widespread use of meth, particularly in the Midwest, has become \nan unsupportable burden for many families and communities. The new \nversion of the Combat Meth Act is a common-sense response to a growing \nproblem one that requires immediate Federal attention. While the bill \ndoes not address the increasing problem of meth imports from overseas, \nit will help cut back on domestic meth manufacturing and the many harms \nthat accompany it.

Buxton holds an important place in North Dakota's \nhistory. It began in 1880 when Budd Reeve plotted the town known today \nas Buxton. Budd Reeve obtained the townsite from the Great Northern \nRailroad in exchange for the land used for the old Union Depot in \nMinneapolis, MN. On October 5, 1880, three cars of lumber were \ndelivered for the new town. At this time the only construction on the \ntown site was an old sod house homestead. By November 2, 1880, a store \nhad been built from this shipment of lumber and was being operated. \nDuring these same months a two-story station and a section house were \nbuilt by the railroad. It was Budd's wife, Harriett Reeve, who \nsuggested the new town be called ``Buxton,'' for T.J. Buxton, a wealthy \nMinneapolis businessman and family friend. The post office was \nestablished November 8, 1880. Chester Fritz, the famous businessman, \nfinancier, and UND benefactor was born in Buxton in 1892.\n  Even after 125 years, Buxton is still a strong agricultural \ncommunity. It is home to both the Central Valley Bean Cooperative and \nthe Farmers Union Elevator. Rural Buxton is also home to the Central \nValley Public School, which is a cooperative school district with \nReynolds, ND.\n  I ask the United States Senate to join me in congratulating Buxton, \nND, and its residents on their first 125 years and in wishing them well \nthrough the next century.

Streeter \nwas founded in the spring of 1905 when Mr. and Mrs. Alex Anderson's \nhomestead was plotted and sold. Mr. and Mrs. Anderson had two \ndaughters, Frances and Florence, whose names marked the first streets \nin the town. The town was named after the editor and newspaper writer \nof Emmons County, D.R. Streeter. The school opened in the fall of 1906, \nand the first council meeting was held on June 22, 1916. By special \nelection in 1950, Streeter became a city, and Oscar Seher was elected \nmayor.\n  The residents of Streeter are enthusiastic about their community and \nthe quality of life it offers. Today, Streeter has a bank, three \nchurches, a farmer's co-op elevator, fire department, and post office. \nA more recent addition is the Streeter Community Cafe, which not only \nserves home cooking, but offers space for community events.\n  Planning for the centennial has been underway for the last several \nyears.

On July 1-3, \nthe residents of Egeland, ND, will celebrate their community's history \nand founding.\n  Egeland is a small town in the northeastern part of North Dakota with \na population of just under 50. Despite its size, Egeland holds an \nimportant place in North Dakota's history. It began in 1905 when the \nSoo Line Railroad established a station and a settlement grew around \nit. Mr. Axel Egeland, a banker\n\n[[Page S7611]]\n\nfrom Bisbee, North Dakota, was employed by the Soo Line Railroad to \nselect the town-site and was, as a Soo agent, given the privilege of \nnaming the new town. Lots were sold August 9, 1905, and on August 23, \n1905, the country store and post office called ``Lakeview'' relocated \nin the town.\n  Today, most families in the Egeland area are involved in farming the \nland. Crops such as wheat, flax, and barley are typical, and farming \nprovides an excellent livelihood for the area's residents. Due to its \nsmall size, the youth of Egeland attend school and participate in \nathletics in the nearby town of Cando. However, the rural nature of the \ncommunity and the interconnectedness of its members make Egeland a \nwonderful location to raise a family.\n  I ask the United States Senate to join me in congratulating Egeland, \nND, and its residents on their first 100 years and in wishing them well \nthrough the next century.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to one of \nNew Mexico's finest public servants, Sheriff Juan Hernandez of Las \nCruces whom I am honored to consider a good friend as well.\n  There are few people in my State's history who have been honored with \na special day to recognize their legacy and accomplishments. On \nDecember 31, 2004, the Dona Ana County Commission honored retiring Dona \nAna County Sheriff Juan Hernandez for his 6 years of service by \nproclaiming Friday the 31st as Juan Hernandez Day.\n  Today, I seek to honor this man who has given greatly to his \ncommunity and to the people of Dona Ana County through his allegiance \nto public service. Juan has worked in law enforcement for 34 years with \nboth the Sheriff's Department and the Las Cruces Police Department. He \nserved as the Dona Ana County Sheriff from January of 1999 to January \nof 2005, and I believe it is for this post Juan will always be \nremembered.\n  In this elected position, Juan sought not to just serve his county \nbut to find ways to improve it. Though his official title was \n``Sheriff,'' he earned himself an added title as the ``Grant Writing \nMachine.'' Over the past 6 years, Juan Hernandez secured $4.8 million \nin Federal grants for a variety of programs whose missions ranged from \ncombating drug use and drunk driving to fighting crime and terrorism \nwithin the county.\n  Juan Hernandez's accolades are numerous and his hard work undeniable. \nWhile I could certainly continue at great length in listing his \naccomplishments, I believe his own words most eloquently describe the \nman behind the badge: ``When you really make an effort to make a \ndifference, the rewards are greater than you can ever imagine.''\n  I feel especially honored to have seen this man's work first-hand and \nto have joined his efforts over the past years to develop Dona Ana \nCounty. Juan, you have made a difference in many lives, and for that \nyou have my and the State of New Mexico's continued respect and \nadmiration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/29/senate-section/article/S7611-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    A CENTURY FOR A ``COMPANY TOWN''\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, a small town in Idaho celebrates its \n100th birthday this month. Potlatch, named after the lumber company \nthat made its home there in the early part of the 20th Century, was \nstarted by Frederick Weyerhaeuser after scouts reported that it would \nbe a fine place to establish a lumber company. When the mill opened, it \nwas the largest white pine sawmill in the world and, in a very \ninteresting way, a social experiment. Weyerhaeuser built a ``company \ntown'' including homes, churches, a post office, schools, commercial \nbuildings and even an opera house and ensured the new towns \nconnectivity to commerce by building a railroad. When you think about \nit, this is quite a phenomenal achievement even for a large company and \nshowed tremendous business foresight as well as a consideration of the \nneeds of its workers. Older residents even tell stories about the \nrather unique way that students were kept in line at school: if the \nstudents got into trouble, the parents were told that they would lose \ntheir job at the mill if the bad behavior continued. How times have \nchanged!\n  Although the population is only about half of what it was in its \nheyday, and no longer a ``company town,'' the notion of community that \nwas bred over decades lives on in Potlatch residents today. I \ncongratulate Potlatch on 100 years of community success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/29/senate-section/article/S7611-3", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/29/senate-section/article/S7611-4", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/29/senate-section/article/S7611-5", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7611-S7612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT TAKES ADDITIONAL STEPS WITH RESPECT TO THE \n NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 12938 OF NOVEMBER 14, \n1994, AMENDING EXECUTIVE ORDER 12938 AND EXECUTIVE ORDER 13094 OF JULY \n     28, 1998, BY BLOCKING PROPERTY OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION \n               PROLIFERATORS AND THEIR SUPPORTERS--PM 16\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 \nU.S.C. 1701 et seq. (IEEPA), I hereby report that I have issued an \nExecutive Order that takes additional steps with respect to the \nnational emergency declared in Executive Order 12938 of November 14, \n1994, regarding the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) \nand the means of delivering them, and the measures imposed by that \norder, as expanded by Executive Order 13094 of July 28, 1998.\n  This order is designed to combat WMD trafficking by blocking the \nproperty of persons that engage in proliferation activities and their \nsupport networks. It is intended to advance international cooperative \nefforts against WMD financing, including with our G-8 partners and \nthrough the Proliferation Security Initiative. This order also provides \na model for other nations to follow in adopting laws to stem the flow \nof financial and other support for proliferation activities, as decided \nin United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540. It further \nimplements a key recommendation of the Silberman-Robb WMD Commission.\n  Executive Order 12938, as amended, authorizes the Secretary of State \nto impose certain measures against foreign persons (individuals or \nentities) determined to have materially contributed to the \nproliferation efforts of any foreign country, project, or entity of \nproliferation concern. The measures that the Secretary of State may \nchoose to impose under Executive Order 12938, as amended, are a ban on \nU.S. Government procurement from the designated foreign person; a ban \non U.S. Government assistance to the designated foreign person; and a \nban on imports from the designated foreign person.\n  Recognizing the need for additional tools to defeat the proliferation \nof WMD, I have signed the new order, which authorizes the imposition of \na new measure--blocking--against WMD proliferators and their support \nnetworks. This action, sometimes referred to as freezing, will apply to \nproperty and interests in property of persons designated under the \norder and will\n\n[[Page S7612]]\n\ndeny such persons access to the U.S. financial and commercial systems. \nModeled after Executive Order 13224 of September 23, 2001, the new \norder provides broad new authorities to target not only persons engaged \nin proliferation activities, but also those providing support or \nservices to such proliferators.\n  In particular, the order blocks the property and interests in \nproperty in the United States, or in the possession or control of \nUnited States persons, of (1) the persons listed in the Annex to the \norder; (2) any foreign person determined by the Secretary of State, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, \nand other relevant agencies, to have engaged, or attempted to engage, \nin activities or transactions that have materially contributed to, or \npose a risk of materially contributing to, the proliferation of WMD or \ntheir means of delivery (including missiles capable of delivering such \nweapons) by any person or foreign country of proliferation concern; (3) \nany person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \nwith the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and other relevant \nagencies, to have provided, or attempted to provide, financial, \nmaterial, technological, or other support for, or goods or services in \nsupport of, proliferation-related activities or any person blocked \npursuant to the order; and (4) any person determined by the Secretary \nof the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the \nAttorney General, and other relevant agencies, to be owned or \ncontrolled by, or acting or purporting to act for or on behalf of, \ndirectly or indirectly, any blocked person.\n  In addition, the order amends section 4(a) of Executive Order 12938, \nas amended, by conforming the criteria for determining that a foreign \nperson has engaged in activity described in that order to the criteria \nfor designations by the Secretary of State set forth in section \n1(a)(ii) of the new order. Executive Order 12938, as amended, will \ncontinue to be an important tool to combat WMD proliferation.\n  Actions taken under the order become effective on June 29, 2005. The \nnew order recognizes the need for more robust tools to defeat the \nproliferation of WMD around the world.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe active business definition under section 355; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nproposing a change to the Internal Revenue Code that has been endorsed \nby both the Joint Committee on Taxation and the United States Treasury \nDepartment. It is a simplification measure that has been passed by this \nbody on three separate occasions, and I am pleased to be joined by the \ngentleman from Montana, Senator Baucus, the Ranking Democratic Member \non the Finance Committee, in introducing this common sense legislation \ntoday. It is now time for Congress to act again and include this \nmeritorious provision in the next appropriate tax bill reported from \nthe Finance Committee.\n  Corporations and affiliated groups of corporations, for any number of \ngood reasons, find it appropriate and many times necessary to shed some \nof their businesses. If the business is not being sold, the Internal \nRevenue Code makes it possible to reorganize without having to \nrecognize gain on the transaction. A typical transaction is a spin-off \ntransaction performed per the terms of section 355 of the Internal \nRevenue Code, where a parent corporation distributes the shares of its \nsubsidiary(s) to its shareholders who once had shares of just the \nparent corporation now have shares of both the parent and the shares of \njust the parent corporation now have shares of its subsidiary(s) to its \nshareholders who once had shares of just the parent corporation now \nhave shares of both the parent and the subsidiary. As a matter of long-\nstanding tax policy, there is typically no tax exacted with these kinds \nof divisions, nor should there be. Typically the business hasn't \nchanged what it is doing; it is simply being done under a separated \nownership structure and the shareholders have ownership in two \ncorporations instead of one, with no overall change in their holdings.\n  In order to be accorded tax-free treatment, section 355 requires the \ncorporation involved in the transaction to be engaged in an ``active \ntrade or business.'' Under the current regulations interpreting section \n355 of the Internal Revenue Code, a much more rigorous test of ``active \ntrade or business'' is imposed if a holding company seeks to spin-off a \nsubsidiary than would be the case if the subsidiary were simply owned \ndirectly by the parent corporation. It is a distinction without \nsubstance and requires corporations, holding companies, to go through \nmajor restructurings to satisfy the requirements of section 355. There \nis absolutely no substantive policy rationale for such a result. The \ndistinction is inappropriate and has been identified as such by both \nthe staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Treasury \nDepartment in 1999 and 2000. This legislation addresses that anomaly \nand treats both situations equally.\n  The cost of this provision is minimal, at about $8 million a year by \nthe last revenue estimate from the staff of the Joint Committee on \nTaxation. This provision is a small but significant step toward \nsimplification of the tax code, and I urge my colleagues on the Finance \nCommittee and in this body to act on this change one more time, and \nhopefully for the last time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, virtually everyone supports tax \nsimplification. But for some reason, it is awfully hard to accomplish. \nToday, I am pleased to join my friend and colleague from Mississippi, \nSenator Lott, in introducing tax legislation that is non-controversial \nand a clear tax simplification measure. Further, the bill we are filing \ntoday has been supported in the past by the Joint Tax Committee and the \nU.S. Treasury.\n  Normally, corporations are taxed on distributions of property to \nshareholders as if sold at fair market value. However, section 355 of \nthe tax code provides corporations with the flexibility to distribute \none or more of their businesses to their shareholders, such as in a \nspin-off, without triggering tax consequences if the transaction meets \nimportant requirements. Through this exception in section 355, \ncorporations may make strategic business decisions without imposing tax \nburdens on their shareholders, but only if both the distributing and \ndistributed businesses continue as an active trade or business. The \nregulatory structure that has evolved over the years under section 355 \nhas created very different ``active trade or business'' tests depending \non whether the distributing corporation operates as a holding company \nor whether it holds the business assets directly. There is no rationale \nto support that distinction.\n  Both the staff of the Joint Tax Committee and the Clinton Treasury \nDepartment recommended that the rules be conformed as a tax \nsimplification measure. The Senate has passed legislation similar to \nwhat we are proposing today on three occasions. And, on one of those \noccasions, it passed the House as well in legislation that was later \nvetoed for other reasons. I have heard of no opposition to this change, \nwhich would simply apply a ``look through'' rule for the ``active trade \nor business'' test on an affiliated group level, so that parent holding \ncompanies could count the active businesses of its subsidiaries. And it \nwould eliminate hours of wasted time and resources in tax planning \nactivities that serve no function other than to try and conform \ncorporate ownership structures to satisfy the literal language of \ncurrent tax requirements.\n  Again, I should emphasize that this proposal does not bring wholesale \nchange to section 355. Spin-off requirements dealing with the \ncontinuity of historical shareholder interest, continuity of business \nenterprises, business purpose, and absence of any device to distribute \nearnings and profits all remain. With a cost of less than $10 million a \nyear, this is an affordable step we can take now to simplify the \nInternal Revenue Code.\n  I am pleased to join with Senator Lott in working for passage of this \nimportant simplification bill, and I urge my colleagues on the Finance \nCommittee and in the Senate give our bill every consideration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself and Mr. Sarbanes):\n  S. 1328. A bill to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to ensure that \nthe District of Columbia and States are provided a safe, lead-free \nsupply of drinking water; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Lead-Free \nDrinking Water Act of 2005 with my colleague Senator Sarbanes. We are \njoined by our colleagues, Congresswoman Norton, Congressman Waxman, and \nothers, who will be introducing the House companion bill today. Today, \nwe introduce this bill for the second time.\n  Last year, we shared the shock felt by DC residents when it was first \nreported that lead levels in the DC public water system were \nsignificantly higher than Federal guidelines, and had been so for at \nleast 2 years.\n  We sought answers to the same questions everyone was asking \nthemselves--How much water did I drink? How much water did my children \ndrink? What are the effects of lead in our bloodstream?\n  We shared the outrage felt by many DC residents, asking ourselves--\nwhy were we not told about this sooner? How did this happen? What are \nwe going to do about it?\n  In the 108th Congress, we attempted to answer those questions. We \nheld a hearing in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and \nlistened to the concerns of DC parents worried about their children's \nhealth.\n  We listened to experts who identified weaknesses in the Safe Drinking \nWater Act and the lead and copper rule, governing how the public is \ninformed when lead is present in a drinking water system and what \ncorrective actions public water systems must take.\n  One of the most disturbing points is that many of the things that \nhappened in Washington, DC, were within the boundaries of the existing \nrules that purport to protect the public from lead in drinking water.\n  We responded by introducing the Lead-Free Drinking Water Act of 2004, \nwhich sought to correct the weaknesses in those rules.\n  Today, we are reintroducing the Lead-Free Drinking Water Act of 2005.\n\n[[Page S7617]]\n\nOur bill will overhaul the Safe Drinking Water Act to strengthen the \nFederal rules governing lead testing and regulations in our public \nwater systems to ensure that our most vulnerable citizens--infants, \nchildren, pregnant women, and new moms--are not harmed by lead in \ndrinking water.\n  Specifically, the bill requires the EPA to reevaluate the current \nregulatory structure to figure out if it really provides the level of \npublic health protection required.\n  The bill calls on the EPA to establish a maximum contaminant level \nfor lead at the tap, and if that is not practical given the presence of \nlead inside home plumbing systems, the bill requires EPA to reevaluate \nthe current action level for lead to ensure that vulnerable populations \nsuch as infants, children, pregnant women, and nursing mothers receive \nadequate protection.\n  I look forward to working with EPA on this evaluation to determine \nwhich approach is most feasible and which provides the greatest level \nof public health protection.\n  EPA has three choices: keep current standard, an ``action level'' at \n15 parts per billion; lower the current action level below 15 parts per \nbillion; establish a ``maximum contaminant load.''\n  For example, it is clear that a maximum contaminant level, which is \nmeasured at the water treatment plant, would do little to protect \npeople from lead-contaminated drinking water at their faucets. Our bill \nrequires that standards be measured at the tap.\n  A low lead action level measured at the tap could provide more \nprotection than a high MCL measured anywhere in the system if there \nwere extremely strong and effective public notification procedures in \nplace.\n  Public notice is the key to success of any lead regulation--parents \nsay to me, ``If only I had known, I could have protected my family.'' \nIt is our job to be sure the public notice system we have in place gets \npeople the information they need when they need it.\n  The bill will require information such as the number of homes tested, \nthe lead levels found, the areas of the community in which they were \nlocated, and the disproportionate adverse health effects of lead on \ninfants, be made public immediately upon detection of lead.\n  In addition, the bill requires that, as part of routine testing \nconducted, any residents whose homes test high for lead receive \nnotification and appropriate medical referrals within 14 days.\n  Finally, we don't want the day of an exceedance to be the first time \npeople have heard about lead in drinking water. The bill establishes a \nbasic public education program to ensure that people have a basic \nunderstanding that lead may be present in drinking water and what the \ncorrective actions might be even before their water system detects a \nproblem.\n  The bill requires increased water testing and lead remediation in \nschools and day-care centers nationwide. This provision exists in law \ntoday, but it was affected by previous litigation. This bill corrects \nthe problem by requiring the Administrator to execute this program if \nstates choose not to. It is wholly unacceptable to do anything less \nthan provide a learning environment for our next generation that does \nnot degrade their intellectual capacity. Our bill provides $150 million \nover 5 years for this program.\n  And we strengthen existing requirements to ensure that all lead \nservice lines will be replaced by a public water system at a rate of 10 \npercent per year until they are gone.\n  This is common sense--let us get rid of the lead in our systems and \nget rid of the lead in our water.\n  Our bill makes water systems responsible for replacing lead service \nlines, including the privately owned sections, once a system exceeds \nlead standards. Homeowners have the final say in whether their line is \nreplaced.\n  We provide $1 billion over 5 years for lead service line replacement.\n  The EPA estimates that our Nation needs $265 billion to maintain and \nimprove its drinking water infrastructure over the next 20 years.\n  If we do not address this, we will be facing more and more health and \nenvironmental issues as our Nation's water infrastructure degrades.\n  Lead service lines are only one part of the picture. Leaded solder \nwas banned in 1987. However, ``lead-free'' plumbing fixtures are \ncurrently allowed to have 8 percent lead.\n  Our bill makes ``lead-free'' mean lead-free. It defines the term as \ntrace amounts of lead -0.2 percent. It prohibits the use of pipes, or \npipe or plumbing fitting or fixtures that are ``high lead'' which our \nbill defines as 2.0 percent lead within 1 year. And within 5 years, it \nprohibits the use of any plumbing components with anymore than 0.2 \npercent lead. This is a huge step toward making our water systems truly \nlead-free.\n  Our bill strengthens existing requirements for leaching by requiring \nindependent third-party performance certification.\n  Finally, our bill requires that the existing requirements for \nleaching be revised to be as protective as the existing leaching \nstandards in California which have set the bar for plumbing fittings \nand fixtures.\n  We urge our colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Last year, Good Housekeeping independently ran a piece about the \nLead-Free Drinking Water Act and gave its readers information to \ncontact us with their support. We received over a thousand responses \nfrom individual readers in 48 States and the District of Columbia.\n  In the 18th century, almost 300 years ago, Ben Franklin concluded \nthat lead was poisonous. In a biography written by Edmund S. Morgan, \nthis story is recounted:\n  At the request of his friend and English publisher Benjamin Vaughan, \nhe wrote out a proof of what he had once casually mentioned in \nconversation: his conclusion that lead was poisonous. After detailing \nhis own and other printers' ailments from the continuous handling of \nlead type, he went on to describe his observations of the grass and \nplants that died from the fumes near furnaces where lead was smelted, \nof the effects of drinking rainwater that sluiced off lead roofs, and \nof his queries to sickened plumbers, painters, and glaziers in a Paris \nhospital. His observations of the toxic effects of lead, he noted, were \nnothing new; and he remarked wryly, ``how long a useful Truth may be \nknown, and exist, before it is generally receiv'd and practis'd on.''\n  We have known lead is a poison for centuries. What are we waiting \nfor? As we learned from the incidents in Washington, DC, and Boston, \nthere are large deficiencies in Federal safe drinking water \nregulations. It is time to plug the holes in these regulations and \nfully protect the public from this poison. It is time to get the lead \nout.\n  Safe drinking water is not a privilege; it is a right--whether you \nlive in Washington, DC, or Washington State or Washington County, VT.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in working to pass the Lead-Free \nDrinking Water Act of 2005 to get the lead out of our pipes, out of our \nwater, out of our families, and out of our lives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Mr. Smith, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Reed, \n        and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 1330. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nincentives for employer-provided employee housing assistance, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today during National Home \nOwnership Month to introduce the Housing America's Workforce Act.\n  Affordable and safe housing plays a vital role in creating and \nsustaining healthy communities and a vibrant workforce. The Housing \nAmerica's Workforce Act creates incentives to expand employer-assisted \nhousing initiatives across the Nation. I thank Senators Smith, \nMartinez, Reed, and Durbin for their co-sponsorship of this important \nlegislation. I would also like to thank Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez \nfor her leadership in introducing the companion bill in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  The sad truth is that across our Nation, working full-time no longer \nguarantees that a family will be able to afford a secure and \ncomfortable home. The shortage of workforce housing has become a \nnational crisis as housing costs have far outgrown the rate of \ninflation in many markets and as the gap between wages and housing \ncosts widens. The result is that affordable housing is out of reach for \na growing number of working families. As a result,\n\n[[Page S7618]]\n\npeople who provide the backbone services for our communities--teachers, \nfirefighters, police officers, and nurses--often cannot afford to live \nin the communities in which they serve. A recent workforce housing \nstudy released by the National Association of Home Builders found that \nfor the most part, workers who provide these vital community services \ncan only find housing they can afford in less than half of the nation's \ntop 25 metropolitan areas.\n  Across the Nation, the number of working families with critical \nhousing problems (defined as those paying more than half of their \nincome for housing and/or living in dilapidated conditions) has \nincreased by 67 percent between 1997 and 2003 to approximately 5 \nmillion families. Families that spend more than half of their income on \nhousing have little income left over for other essentials such as food, \nhealthcare, and transportation.\n  And despite overall improvements in home-ownership trends since 1978, \nworking families--employed households with children earning less than \n120 percent of Area Median Income--have actually experienced a decrease \nin homeownership rates. A 2004 Center for Housing Policy study shows \nthat the homeownership rate for working families with children was at \n62.5 percent in 1978, and only 56.6 percent through 2001.\n  Employer-assisted housing, EAH, is a local, innovative solution that \na growing number of employers are using to meet the housing needs of \ntheir employees while increasing the competitiveness of their \nbusinesses. There are several types of EAH products, including \nhomebuyer education, down payment assistance, rental assistance and \nloan guarantee programs. Employers often combine these products to meet \ntheir employees' specific needs in the most effective ways.\n  The benefits for employees and employers are impressive. The \nemployee, in addition to receiving financial support from an employer \nto buy or rent a home closer to work, also regains extra time--formerly \nspent in traffic--for family or community life. The employer likewise \nbenefits from a more stable workforce when employees live near work. \nThey enjoy the advantages from the improved employee morale, lower \nturnover rate and reduced recruitment costs result in bottom line \nsavings that the increased proximity brings. Furthermore, EAH programs \nbenefit not only the workers and employers, but also the entire \ncommunity. As former commuters buy homes near the jobsite, the \nsurrounding community which previously suffered from traffic \ncongestion, now enjoys new investment and property tax revenues.\n  The Housing America's Workforce Act is inspired in great part by \nlessons learned in States and local communities across the Nation, \nwhere EAH has proven to be an effective tool to promote housing \naffordability for working families and community revitalization. \nThrough EAH programs, the private sector becomes part of the solution, \ninvesting in housing assistance for employees while experiencing bottom \nline benefits. This is clearly a public-private partnership that is \nproven and makes sense.\n  The Housing America's Workforce Act provides incentives to increase \nprivate sector investment in housing in three important ways. First, it \noffers a tax credit of 50 cents for every dollar that an employer \nprovides to eligible employees up to $10,000 or six percent of the \nemployee's home purchase price, whichever is less, or up to $2,000 for \nrental assistance. Second, to ensure that employees receive the full \nvalue of employers' contributions, the Act defines housing assistance \nas a ``nontaxable benefit,'' similar to health, dental and life \ninsurance. Third, the act establishes a competitive grant program \navailable to nonprofit housing organizations that provide technical \nassistance, program administration, and outreach support to employers \nundertaking EAH initiatives.\n  In New York and in other parts of the country, EAH has caught on with \nthe local business community, elected and appointed officials, and the \nbroader housing arena. Its expansion indicates a growing understanding \namong the private sector that it pays to invest in workforce housing. I \nhave worked with employers across my State to launch county employer-\nassisted housing programs in places such as Long Island, Rochester and \nWestchester.\n  I have met many of the families that have already benefited from Long \nIsland's EAH program, which I helped launch in 2002. People like the \nIsaacs family, who were able to buy their first home in North \nAmityville in 2002 thanks to their employer's participation in the \nprogram. Pamela Isaac, like so many employees on Long Island, works as \na Dietician at Our Lady of Consolation, part of the Catholic Health \nServices Network. Catholic Health Services' participation in the \nemployer assisted housing program enabled Pamela and her husband \nBartholomew to stay on Long Island and raise their three children in \ntheir own home.\n  I also worked in collaboration with Mayor William A. Johnson of \nRochester to jumpstart the City of Rochester's EAH initiative. The City \nprovides $3,000 for its own employees and also encourages other \nemployers to provide a home purchase benefit by offering to match that \nbenefit dollar for dollar up to a maximum of $3,000. Therefore, if an \nemployer offered the maximum benefit of $3,000, he or she would produce \na $6,000 benefit for his or her employees with the city's matching \nfunds.\n\n  The Westchester County EAH, which was spEAHheaded by the Business \nCouncil and Fannie Mae, brings together the following Westchester \nCounty nonprofit organizations: Housing Action Council, Westchester \nResidential Opportunities, Westchester Housing Fund and Community \nHousing Innovations. Each of these nonprofits provides standardized, \ncomprehensive education and counseling support to participating \nemployers. The initiative also provides matching funds of up to $3,000 \nfrom Westchester County or from the cities of Yonkers, New Rochelle, \nWhite Plains or Mount Vernon. In addition, the nonprofit collaborative \noffers down payment and closing cost assistance programs that can match \nemployer contributions.\n  The creation of Federal incentives to expand employer-assisted \nhousing has been a consistent recommendation of experts in the broader \nhousing arena, including the Millennial Housing Commission. In \naddition, former HUD Secretaries Henry Cisneros and Jack Kemp, along \nwith Nic Retsinas and Kent Colton of the Harvard Joint Center for \nHousing Studies recently released a bipartisan platform for national \nhousing policy, which includes EAH as one of its recommendations.\n  According to the Society for Human Resources Management's 2004 \nBenefits Survey, 12 percent of employers offered home ownership \nassistance in 2004, up from 7 percent in 2002. Since 1991, Fannie Mae \nhas offered a nationwide EAH program through participating lending \ninstitutions and employers. Fannie Mae has helped about 750 employers \nof various sizes implement EAH programs and nearly 570 have been \nlaunched since 2000. Freddie Mac launched a similar national program in \n1999, which it expanded in 2004. Several states have enacted EAH tax \nincentive programs, including Illinois, Connecticut, Missouri, and New \nJersey.\n  Employer-assisted housing programs offer a fresh approach to \naddressing our Nation's housing challenge by allowing the private \nsector to play a direct role in promoting housing affordability. I hope \nevery Senator will recognize that the Housing America's Workforce Act \nwill create opportunities for us as a Nation to expand these public-\nprivate partnerships and will make a profound impact in the lives of \nour workforce, and I hope that you will support this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senators Clinton, \nMartinez, Reed, and Durbin to introduce the Housing America's Workforce \nAct.\n  Across the country, low- and moderate-income families face difficulty \nfinding affordable housing. Homebuilding has not kept pace with job \ngrowth, and the cost of housing has skyrocketed. In the last 5 years, \nthe number of working U.S. families paying more than half their income \nto put a roof over their heads has jumped to 4.2 million in 2003 from \n2.4 million in 1997, a 76-percent increase in 5 years.\n  Our bill tries to address the issue of affordable housing from a new \nperspective, one that allows the private sector to play a direct role \nin promoting housing affordability. Specifically, our bill would create \na Federal tax credit for\n\n[[Page S7619]]\n\nbusinesses that offer housing assistance programs to their low- to \nmoderate-income employees.\n  Employer assisted housing, EAH, programs have been used successfully \nfor more than 100 years and have proven effective in helping to \nrevitalize neighborhoods and to recruit and retain employees. In my \nhome State of Oregon, EAH programs have been used by employers such as \nLegacy Emanuel Hospital & Health Center, Housing Authority of Portland, \nMultnomah County, and Wacker Siltronic.\n  In 1990, Legacy Emanuel developed an EAH program to encourage \nemployees to purchase homes in the neighborhood near the hospital. The \nprogram shortened employee commute time, reduced traffic congestion, \nand helped spur a dramatic revitalization of the surrounding area. \nSimilar programs have succeeded around the country and have helped to \nease the spatial mismatch between where job growth is taking place and \nwhere people can afford to live.\n  Under our bill, housing assistance can be used for either \nhomeownership or rental assistance. Homeownership assistance could be \nused for down payments, closing costs, financing costs, or \ncontributions to an employee homeownership savings plan, such as an \nIndividual Development Accounts. Rental assistance could be used for \nsecurity deposits and rental payments.\n  Employer assisted housing programs are innovative ways to leverage \npublic and private funds to make housing affordable for working \nfamilies. As such, our proposal has been endorsed by National Housing \nConference, National Association of Home Builders, National Association \nof Realtors, National Association of Housing and Redevelopment \nOfficials, National League of Cities, National Association of Counties, \nMortgage Bankers Association, National NeighborWorks Association, \nAmeriDream, and the National Association of Local Housing Finance \nAgencies.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to address \nthe affordable housing shortfall.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON (for himself, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Dorgan, \n        Mr. Burns, Mr. Thune, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 1331. A bill to amend the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to \nchange the date of implementation of country of origin labeling to \nJanuary 30, 2006; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an issue of great \nimportance to producers and consumers in my home State of South Dakota \nand across the Nation. Mandatory country of origin labeling, COOL, \nremains an overwhelmingly popular provision not only as a consumer \nright-to-know issue, but also as a marketing tool for our Nation's \nfarmers and ranchers.\n  Mandatory country of origin labeling was signed into law under this \nmost recent Farm Bill and by this current President. As the primary \nauthor of the COOL language included in the 2002 Farm Bill, I am \nincreasingly frustrated at the amount of heel dragging this \nAdministration has shown for the program. I rise to introduce a bill to \nmove forward with the implementation of mandatory COOL in a timely and \nreasonable manner, instating a January 30, 2006 mandatory date of \nimplementation. COOL has experienced great bipartisan support in the \nSenate. I am pleased that Senator Craig Thomas joins me in this \nbipartisan effort, as does Senator Mike Enzi, Senator Byron Dorgan, and \nSenator Conrad Burns.\n  I worked with my Senate colleagues to ensure that no delay language \nwas included in the Senate version of the fiscal year 2006 Agriculture \nAppropriations Bill that was reported out of committee. As a member of \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee, and specifically, the Agriculture \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I worked with my Senate colleagues to \nensure we assembled a satisfactory bill that did not contain the same \ndelay language as found in the House agriculture spending measure. The \nHouse fiscal year 2006 Agriculture Appropriations Bill contained a 1-\nyear delay for meat and meat products, which is identical to the \nsituation that unfolded with the program in fiscal year 2004.\n  While the House version of the fiscal year 2004 spending bill \ncontained a 1-year delay for meat and meat products exclusively, the \nfinal omnibus contained a 2-year delay for all covered commodities \nexcept fish and shellfish. During closed door consideration of the \nmeasure, Senate leadership chose to bow to special interest groups \ndespite the significant support COOL experiences from the majority of \nconsumers and producers. While I was pleased to see the Senate version \nof the fiscal year 2006 bill that we reported out of committee \ncontained $3.111 million for an audit-based compliance program for COOL \nimplementation, the United States Department of Agriculture, USDA, \nAgricultural Marketing Service, AMS, will need substantive funding for \nthe implementation of the full program. While the money funds an audit-\nbased compliance program exclusively for fish and shellfish, additional \ndollars are needed for the inclusion of all covered commodities.\n  Mandatory COOL for fish and shellfish was implemented on April 4, \n2005. USDA instituted a six month phase-in period to ensure adequate \ntime for compliance, and the Department promulgated an interim final \nrule on September 30, 2004. Given this process, I see no reason why the \nDepartment should not proceed with the promulgation of the interim \nfinal rule for all covered commodities at the earliest possible time. \nIf the implementation date is moved to January 30, 2006, then producers \nand consumers will at least see benefits under the program by late \nsummer of 2006. Producers and consumers have waited long enough for \nprogram implementation, and it is high time USDA move forward with the \nimplementation of this crucial program.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am proud to join the chairman and the \nranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee in cosponsoring the \nPersonal Data Privacy and Security Act of 2005. This bill is a much-\nneeded solution to the daunting problem of ensuring the privacy and the \nsecurity of our personal data, which has become such a precious \ncommodity.\n  As we enter the 21st century, several forces are converging to make \nour personal information more valuable--and vulnerable--than ever. The \nworld is going digital, and so is our personal data. In this day and \nage, almost everything we do results in a third party creating a \ndigital record about us--digital records that we may not even realize \nexist. We seek the convenience of opening bank accounts and making \nmajor purchases over the Internet, often without ever speaking to \nanother person face to face or even over the telephone, making identity \ntheft easier and more lucrative. Businesses, nonprofits and even \npolitical parties are personalizing their messages, products and \nservices to a degree we've never seen before, and they are willing to \ninvest significant amounts of money in collecting personal information \nabout potential customers or donors. And we are living in an age where \nidentity-based screening and security programs can be vitally \nimportant, resulting in more information being collected about \nindividuals in an attempt to identify them accurately.\n  As a result, personal information has become a hot commodity that is \nbought, sold, and--as so often happens when something becomes \nvaluable--stolen.\n  We are at a crossroads. We all know about the security breaches that \nhave been on the front pages of newspapers all over the country for the \npast 6 months. They have placed the identities of hundreds of thousands \nof Americans at risk.\n  But this is about much more than just information security. Until \nCalifornia law required ChoicePoint to notify individuals that their \ninformation was compromised and they might be vulnerable to identity \ntheft, many Americans had never heard of this company. As news stories \nfocused on the data broker business, many Americans were surprised to \ndiscover that companies are creating digital dossiers about them that \ncontain massive amounts of information, and that these companies sell \nthat information to commercial and government entities. The revelations \nabout these security breaches highlighted the fact that Americans \nneed a better understanding of what happens to their information in a \ndigital world--and what kind of consequences they can face as a result.\n\n[[Page S7620]]\n\n  When I am back home in Wisconsin, I hear from people who do not \nunderstand why companies have the right to sell their sensitive \npersonal information. I hear from people who are shocked to discover \nthat personal information about them is available for free on the \nInternet.\n  There is no question that data aggregators facilitate societal \nbenefits, allowing consumers to obtain instant credit and personalized \nservices, and police officers to locate suspects. But these companies \nalso gather a great deal of potentially sensitive information about \nindividuals, and in many instances they go largely unregulated.\n  Too many of my constituents feel they have lost control over their \nown information. Congress must return some power to individual \nAmericans so that we can all better understand and manage what happens \nto our own personal data.\n  The Personal Data Privacy and Security Act takes a comprehensive \napproach to the privacy and security problems we face. It gives \nconsumers back some control over their own information. The bill \nrequires data brokers to allow consumers to access their own \ninformation, and to investigate when consumers tell them that \ncorrections are necessary. And it requires companies to give notice to \naffected consumers and to law enforcement if there is a serious \nsecurity breach, so that individuals know their identity may be at risk \nand can take steps to protect themselves.\n  In addition, the bill increases penalties for those who steal our \nidentities. It provides grants to State and local law enforcement to \nhelp them combat data fraud and related crimes. It requires companies \nthat buy and sell information to have appropriate data security systems \nin place. It provides protection to Social Security numbers by \nprohibiting the sale, purchase or display of Social Security numbers, \nwith certain exceptions, and preventing companies from requiring \ncustomers to provide their Social Security numbers in order to purchase \ngoods or services. These protections will help safeguard against future \nprivacy violations and security breaches in the commercial data \nindustry. But that is not all this bill accomplishes.\n  The bill also contains some critically important privacy and security \nprovisions to govern the Government's use of commercial data. This is \nan aspect of the data broker business that has not yet gotten as much \nattention in the wake of the recent security breaches. The information \ngathered by these companies is not just sold to individuals and \nbusinesses; Government agencies of all stripes also buy or subscribe to \ninformation from commercial sources. The most recent example was the \ndiscovery that the Pentagon has a contract with a marketing firm to \nanalyze commercial and other data about high school and college \nstudents.\n\n  While I believe the Government should be able to access commercial \ndatabases in appropriate circumstances, there are few existing rules or \nguidelines to ensure this information is used responsibly. Nor are \nthere restrictions on the use of commercial data for powerful, \nintrusive data mining programs, an issue I have been particularly \nconcerned about. The Privacy Act, which governs when Government \nagencies themselves are collecting data, does not apply because the \ninformation is held outside the Government and is not gathered solely \nat Government direction.\n  As a result, there is a great deal we do not know about Government \nuse of commercial data, even in clearly appropriate circumstances such \nas when the agency's goal is simply to locate an individual already \nsuspected of a crime.\n  We don't know under what circumstances Government employees can \nobtain access to these databases or for what purposes. We don't know \nhow Government agencies evaluate the accuracy of the databases to which \nthey subscribe, or how the accuracy level affects government use of the \ndata. We don't know how employees are monitored to ensure they do not \nabuse their access to these databases, or how those who misuse the \ninformation are punished. And we don't know how Government agencies, \nparticularly those engaged in sensitive national security \ninvestigations, ensure that the data brokers cannot keep records of who \nthe Government is investigating, records which themselves could create \na huge security risk in light of the vulnerabilities that have come to \nthe forefront in recent months.\n  That is why I am so pleased that this bill includes provisions to \naddress the Government's use of commercial data. A comprehensive \napproach to data privacy and security would be incomplete without \ntaking on this piece of the puzzle. The bill recognizes there are many \nlegitimate reasons for Government agencies to obtain commercially \navailable data, but that they need to be subject to privacy and \nsecurity protections. It takes a commonsense approach, pushing \nGovernment agencies to take basic steps to ensure that individuals' \npersonal information is secure and only used for legitimate purposes, \nand that the commercial information the Government is paying for and \nrelying on is accurate and complete.\n  Specifically, the bill would require that Federal agencies that \nsubscribe to commercial data adopt standards governing its use. These \nstandards would reflect long-standing basic privacy principles. The \nbill would ensure that Government agencies consider and determine which \npersonnel will be permitted to access the information and under what \ncircumstances; develop retention policies for this personal data and \nget rid of data they no longer need, minimizing the opportunity for \nabuse or theft; rely only on accurate and complete data, and penalize \nvendors who knowingly provide inaccurate information to the Federal \nGovernment; provide individuals who suffer adverse consequences as a \nresult of the agency's reliance on commercial data with a redress \nmechanism; and establish enforcement mechanisms for those privacy \npolicies.\n\n  The bill also extends to other screening programs the existing \nprotections that already are in place to govern the Transportation \nSecurity Administration's possible use of commercial data for its \nidentity-based airline passenger screening program, Secure Flight. If \nthe Federal Government is going to rely on commercial data to screen \nAmericans and decide whether to permit them to travel by air or engage \nin other common activities, it should do so only subject to explicit \ncongressional authorization, as this bill provides. In addition, \nagencies should have to provide a redress process for those wrongly \naffected, and should have to operate under rules that govern the \naccess, use, disclosure, accuracy and retention of that data.\n  The bill also directs the General Services Administration to review \nGovernment contracts for commercial data to make sure that vendors have \nappropriate security programs in place, and that they do not provide \ninformation to the Government that they know to be inaccurate. And it \nrequires agencies to audit the information security practices of their \nvendors.\n  These are basic good Government measures. They guarantee that the \nFederal Government is not wasting money on inaccurate data, and that \nvendors are undertaking the security programs that they have promised \nand for which the Government is paying.\n  We live in a new digital world. The law may never fully keep up with \ntechnology, but we must make every effort we can. I am proud to be \ninvolved in this comprehensive, reasoned approach to privacy and \nsecurity. I congratulate Chairman Specter and Ranking Member Leahy for \ntheir excellent work on this bill. This bill is important and it \ndeserves very serious consideration by the Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 1332. A bill to prevent and mitigate identity theft; to ensure \nprivacy; and to enhance criminal penalties, law enforcement assistance, \nand other protections against security breaches, fraudulent access, and \nmisuse of personally identifiable information; read the first time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce S. 1332, the \nPersonal Data Privacy and Security Act of 2005.\n  Not too long ago, our personal information--our Social Security \nnumbers, our date of birth, our mothers' maiden name, where we live-all \nremained relatively private. Where we live, and what we paid for our \nhouse, and whether we had a mortgage might have been publicly \navailable, but finding that information out would require a trip to\n\n[[Page S7621]]\n\nthe local recorders office. Our privacy was preserved by the sheer \ndifficulty of obtaining the information. This privacy--the ability to \nbe left alone--has been a cherished value throughout American history.\n  As our day-to-day transactions have become electronic, more and more \nof our personal data has been stored, transmitted and accessed \nelectronically. Almost all of us have benefited from this change. \nBecause our personal information is available electronically, we can \npurchase goods and services over the phone or on the internet. We can \nobtain a mortgage or rent an apartment in a matter of hours. We can \napply for a credit card while we wait at the store and purchase things \non-line. The availability of such information also helps law \nenforcement agencies conduct investigations and catch criminals. The \ninformation has also been used to do good. In one instance, Associated \nPress journalists matched Social Security numbers obtained from data \nbrokers to Mississippi prison data exposing eight school teachers who \nfailed to report that they had been convicted of sex offenses or drug \ncrimes.\n  However, as Justice Warren prophetically wrote in the 1963 case, \nLopez v. United States--a case balancing the privacy interests of an \nindividual with the law enforcement needs of the government--``The \nfantastic advances in the field of electronic communication constitute \na great danger to the privacy of the individual.'' In electronic form, \nour personal information is both more valuable and more vulnerable. As \nwe have all witnessed in recent months, electronic data is more \nvulnerable because it can be accessed from afar and can be stolen in a \nsplit second. The problem first became apparent when data brokers, \ncompanies that buy and sell our personal data, announced that they had \nexperienced large-scale breaches involving the personal data of \nhundreds of thousands of Americans. In February, ChoicePoint, one of \nthe Nation's largest collectors of consumer information, notified over \n145,000 Americans of a system security breach. In March, LexisNexis \nannounced that unauthorized persons posing as legitimate customers \nobtained personal the personal data of over 300,000 Americans.\n  It soon became apparent that the problem extended beyond data \nbrokers. In April, Carnegie Mellon University notified 19,000 students, \nalumni, faculty and staff that their personal data may have been \ncompromised. In May, a data storage company lost information on 600,000 \ncurrent and former employees of Time Warner. In recent days, MasterCard \nannounced 40 million credit card numbers belonging to U.S. consumers \nwere accessed by a computer hacker--the largest breach yet.\n  Even government agencies have not been immune. Personal data \nincluding Social Security numbers on nearly 6,000 current and former \nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation employees was stolen early last \nyear, some of which has been used for fraudulent purposes.\n  Electronic personal data is more valuable because identity thieves \ncan steal large volumes and use it before anyone knows. For the last 5 \nyears, Identity Theft has topped the FTC's list of consumer complaints. \nFrom 2002 to 2004, the number of complaints rose 52 percent, to \n246,570. Put another way, that's once every 2 minutes. But this is only \nthe tip of the iceberg. Not all consumers report identity theft to the \nFTC. Not all victims report identity theft to their local police. Sixty \npercent of those who did file a report with the FTC did not call their \nlocal police department. It stands to reason that many did not call the \nFTC.\n  A recent study by the Better Business Bureau concluded that 9.3 \nmillion Americans were victims of identity fraud in 2004, and that each \nvictim lost approximately $5,800. Ultimately, nearly 20 percent \nAmericans will become victims of identity theft. Worse, according to \nthe study, it took victims an average of 28 hours on the phone with \ncreditors and credit bureaus to clear their names. I use the term \n``clear'' loosely, because in many cases the damage caused by identity \ntheft is irreversible. Victims will have fraud alerts on their credit \nreports for years to come, making it more difficult to open new \naccounts or make major purchases. Some will be erroneously contacted by \ncollection agencies.\n  Individuals whose personal information is not stolen also suffer. \nBusinesses lose nearly $50 billion a year from identity thieves posing \nas customers. These losses translate into increased prices for every \nconsumer.\n  In some cases, the availability of electronic personal data can lead \nto tragedy. In 1999, a former high school classmate of Amy Lynn Boyer \nobtained her former work address and social security number from an on-\nline data broker. By calling her home and posing as the former \nemployer, he convinced Amy's mom to give him Amy's work address. He \nthen drove to Boyer's workplace and fatally shot her.\n  In an effort to protect the privacy and security of our electronic \npersonal information, and prevent future tragedies, small and large, my \ncolleague Senator Leahy and I are introducing the Personal Data Privacy \nand Security Act of 2005. First, this legislation goes after identity \nthieves by increasing penalties for crimes involving electronic \npersonal data. For example, it increases penalties for computer fraud \nwhen such fraud involves personal data. It also goes after those who \nintentionally expose Americans to identity theft by punishing those who \nintentionally conceal a security breach that involves personal data.\n  The bill also empowers Americans to look after the privacy of their \nown data. The bill will allow individuals to obtain access to any \npersonal information held by data brokers. For individuals who believe \ntheir information is wrong, data brokers must provide them with \nguidance on how to correct their information.\n  The legislation also puts the burden those that store, transmit and \naccess electronic personal data. It will require the companies, \ngovernment agencies, universities that keep significant amounts of \npersonal data to assess the vulnerability of their systems and to adopt \npolicies that will address those vulnerabilities. Some entities will \nchoose to encrypt the personal data that they store and transmit. \nOthers will pick a means more appropriate their size and the \nsensitivity of their data.\n  Of course, these provisions do not apply to data held by health care \nproviders and financial institutions that is already regulated by other \nfederal laws. This legislation fills in gaps left by other federal \nlaws. It has become clear that many entities other than health care \nproviders and financial institutions have large amounts of personal \ninformation. This legislation would require such entities to adequately \nprotect their electronic data.\n  Such measures will not always be enough. As I've already noted, the \nnature of electronic data makes it vulnerable even when those who hold \nit take reasonable steps to protect it. Currently, no federal law \nrequires those who maintain our sensitive personal data to notify \naffected individuals when such data is lost or exposed. This \nlegislation would require those who maintained such data to notify \naffected individuals as well as law enforcement. As everyone knows, \nknowledge is power. Once individuals learn that their personal \ninformation is exposed, they can take steps to protect themselves. And, \nthe company, school or agency that experienced the breach must help. \nThey must provide individuals whose data was lost with a monthly credit \nreport and they must provide information on the identity theft victim \nassistance available to them. For large breaches, the media must be \nnotified. Media reports over the past few months have made Americans \nfar more aware of the problem of security breaches. Hopefully, we can \ncontinue to raise awareness by requiring data holders to continue the \npractice of making public announcements regarding large breaches. \nNotice will also give law enforcement a head start in the effort to \nprevent harm to individuals as a result of a breach.\n  One of the most critical pieces of information that can be lost is \none's Social Security number. We can all think of instances when we've \nbeen asked for our Social Security number to verify our identities--\nutilities, doctors, schools--I could go on. In itself, this is not \nharmful. Problems arise however, when the Social Security number gets \npassed along to others without the person's knowledge or permission. \nThe legislation would prohibit companies from buying, selling or \ndisplaying a Social Security number without consent\n\n[[Page S7622]]\n\nfrom the individual whose number it is. The bill also would prevent \ncompanies from requiring individuals to give their Social Security \nnumber in order to obtain goods or services. Finally, it would bar \ngovernment agencies from posting public records that contain Social \nSecurity numbers on the internet. This legislation would not prevent \nthe use of Social Security numbers altogether. We recognize that would \nnot be practical. It would, however, protect the value of Social \nSecurity numbers by preventing their proliferation.\n  Finally, this legislation will protect the privacy of all Americans \nby providing a check on the government's use of databases maintained by \ndata brokers. As I've already noted, federal law enforcement uses \nelectronic personal data maintained by data brokers to track criminals \nand criminal activity. Correctly used, these databases can be very \nuseful tools in the fight against crime. However, there should be some \ncheck on their use. In addition, the legislation aims at making sure \nthe government's use of such data is secure. It will require audits to \nensure that data brokers are keeping law enforcement inquiries private.\n  This bill represents a comprehensive effort to protect the privacy \nand security of electronic personal data. Our lives have all been made \neasier because our personal information is readily available to those \nwho have a legitimate need for it. This legislation aims to keep such \ninformation out of the hands of those who have no legitimate need for \nit. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1332\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Reforms are urgently \nneeded to protect Americans' privacy and to secure their personal data. \nThere have been steady waves of security breaches over the past 6 \nmonths, with the latest involving a database containing 40 million \ncredit card numbers at a company that most Americans never knew \nexisted.\n  These security breaches are a window on a broader, more challenging \ntrend. Advanced technologies have improved our lives and can help make \nus safer. Private data about Americans has become a hot commodity. This \npersonal and financial information about each of us suddenly is a \ntreasure trove, valuable and vulnerable, but our privacy and security \nlaws have not kept pace. The reality is that in the digital era, a \nrobust market has developed for collecting and selling personal \ninformation. Today, all types of corporate and governmental entities \nroutinely traffic in billions of digitized personal records about \nAmericans.\n  The data broker market has exploded in size to meet this demand. \nInsecure databases are now low-hanging fruit for hackers looking to \nsteal identities and commit fraud. We are seeing a rise\n\n[[Page S7632]]\n\nin organized rings that target personal data to sell in online, virtual \nbazaars.\n  In this information-saturated age, the use of personal data has \nsignificant consequences for every American. People have lost jobs, \nmortgages and control over their credit and identities because personal \ninformation has been mishandled or listed incorrectly. This trend \nraises new threats to our personal security as well as to our privacy. \nIn one disturbing case, a stalker purchased the Social Security number \nof a woman with whom he was obsessed, used that information to track \nher down. He killed her, and then shot himself.\n  Americans everywhere are wondering, ``Why do all these companies have \nmy personal information? What are they doing with it? Why aren't they \nprotecting it better?'' And they are right to wonder. It is time for \nCongress to catch up with the data market and to show the American \npeople that we are aware of these threats and will protect the privacy \nand security of their personal information.\n  Chairman Specter and I have worked closely together over many months \nto craft comprehensive legislation to fix key vulnerabilities in our \ninformation economy. We thought through these issues carefully and took \nthe time needed to develop well-balanced, focused legislation that \nprovides strong protections where necessary. We also provide tough \npenalties and consequences for failing to protect Americans' most \npersonal information. Reforms like these are long overdue. This issue \nand our legislation deserve to become a key part of this year's \ndomestic agenda so that we can achieve some positive changes in areas \nthat affect the everyday lives of Americans.\n  First, our bill requires data brokers to let people know what \ninformation they have about them, and to allow people to correct \ninaccurate information. These principles have precedent from the credit \nreport context, and we have adapted them in a way that makes sense for \nthe data brokering industry. It's a simple matter of fairness.\n  Second, we would require companies that have databases with personal \ninformation on Americans to establish and implement data privacy and \nsecurity programs. Any company that wants to be trusted by the public \nin this day and age must vigilantly protect databases housing \nAmericans' private data. They also have a responsibility in the next \nlink in the security chain, to make sure that contractors hired to \nprocess data are on the up-and-up and secure. This is critical as \nAmericans' personal information is increasingly processed overseas.\n  Third, our bill requires notice when sensitive personal information \nhas been compromised. The American people have a right to know when \nthey are at risk because of corporate failures to protect their data, \nor when a criminal has infiltrated data systems. The notice rules in \nour bill were crafted carefully to ensure that the trigger for notice \nis tied to risk and to recognize important fraud prevention techniques \nthat already exist. But our priority was making sure that victims have \nthat critical information as a roadmap providing the assistance \nnecessary to protect themselves, their families and their financial \nwell-being.\n  Fourth, our bill provides tough new protections for Social Security \nnumbers, which are the keys to unlocking so much of our financial and \npersonal lives. The use of Social Security numbers has expanded well \nbeyond the intended purposes. Some uses provide important benefits, but \nothers have made Americans vulnerable. Social Security numbers are for \nsale online for small fees. Earlier this year, it was reported that a \npayroll and benefits company put the Social Security numbers of 1,000 \nworkers on postcards--on postcards--brazenly visible for anyone to see. \nWorse still, those postcards described in detail how those Social \nSecurity numbers could be used to access employee benefits online. This \nis unacceptable, and this bill would make that kind of disregard and \nsloppiness illegal.\n  Finally, our bill addresses the government's use of personal data. We \nare living in a world where the government is increasingly looking to \nthe private sector to get personal data that it could not legally \ncollect on its own without oversight and appropriate protections. So \ningrained has the data broker-government partnership become that a \nChoicePoint executive stated, ``We do act as an intelligence agency, \ngathering data, applying analytics.'' While these relationships can \nhelp protect us, there must be oversight and appropriate protections.\n  The recent decision to award ChoicePoint an IRS contract highlights \nthis tension. It is especially galling right now to be rewarding firms \nthat have been so careless with the public's confidential information. \nThe dust has not yet settled and the investigations are incomplete on \nChoicePoint's lax security practices. We should at least take a pause \nbefore rewarding such missteps with even more government contracts. \nThis bill would place privacy and security front and center in \nevaluating whether data brokers can be trusted with government \ncontracts that involve sensitive information about the American people. \nIt would require contract reviews that include these considerations, \naudits to ensure good practice, and contract penalties for failure to \nprotect data privacy and security.\n\n  The Specter-Leahy legislation meets other key goals. It provides \ntough monetary and criminal penalties for compromising personal data or \nfailing to provide necessary protections. This creates an incentive for \ncompanies to protect personal information, especially when there is no \ncommercial relationship between individuals and companies using their \ndata.\n  Our legislation also carefully balances the need for Federal \nuniformity and State leadership. States are often on the forefront of \nprotecting privacy and spurring change. The California security breach \nlaw has been an important lesson. My State of Vermont was among the \nfirst--if not the first--to require individual consent before sharing \nfinancial information with third parties, and to require a person or \nbusiness to obtain consent from individuals before reviewing their \ncredit reports. The role of States is important, and our bill \nidentifies areas that require uniformity while leaving the States free \nto act elsewhere as they see fit. We also would authorize an additional \n$100 million over 4 years to help state law enforcement fight misuse of \npersonal information.\n  This is a solid bill--a comprehensive bill--that not only deals with \nproviding Americans notice when they have already been hurt, but also \ndeals with the underlying problem of lax security and lack of \naccountability in dealing with their most personal and private \ninformation.\n  I commend Senator Specter for his leadership on this emerging \nproblem. A number of us have been working on these issues--Senator \nFeinstein, Senator Nelson, Senator Cantwell and Senator Schumer, among \nothers. I appreciate and recognize their hard work and look forward to \nmaking progress together. I am pleased to work closely with Senator \nSpecter on this and believe that we have a bill that significantly \nadvances the ball in protecting Americans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mrs. Lincoln, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. \n        Talent, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Roberts, \n        Mr. Brownback, Mr. Bond, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Allard, Mr. Alexander, \n        Mr. Martinez, and Mr. Pryor):\n  S. 1333. A bill to amend the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to \nestablish a voluntary program for country of origin labeling of meat, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Meat \nPromotion Act of 2005.\n  This legislation is long overdue. When implemented, it will help \nassist our producers of cattle, pork, and other livestock to market and \npromote their products as born and raised in the United States. This \nproposal provides an efficient and effective solution to the country-\nof-origin labeling dilemma.\n  The Meat Promotion Act of 2005 will benefit U.S. food producers by \npromoting American-grown foods. This bipartisan effort is widely \nsupported by producers, processors, and retailers as a means to finally \nmove country-of-origin labeling forward.\n  This legislation provides for USDA implementation of a labeling \nprogram\n\n[[Page S7633]]\n\nthat will be similar to the many voluntary labeling programs that \ncurrently exist. Hundreds of programs that label products by region, \nstate, and U.S. brand have already proven their value for producers and \nconsumers alike. The Meat Promotion Act will put the marketplace in \ncharge by allowing producers to meet consumer demand. Where that demand \nis demonstrated, more products labeled with country-of-origin will \nbecome available.\n  Country-of-origin labeling has been an issue in the Senate for quite \nawhile, and yet, after all this time, we're no closer to promoting U.S. \nproducts than we were a decade ago. In reviewing the storied history of \nthis issue, it's clear that there is not a shortage of viewpoints. One \nview overwhelmingly vocalized is that U.S. producers of beef and pork \nwant to market and promote their products as born and raised in the \nUnited States of America. They are proud of what they produce, and they \nshould be: the U.S. produces the safest, most abundant food supply at \nthe most affordable price, and our livestock producers want to capture \nthe value they add to the market.\n  But just like every other debate in Washington, the debate over \ncountry-of-origin labeling has been about the means to accomplish the \ngoal. It is not that we are fighting about whether or not promoting \nU.S. product is a good idea. We are fighting about how to do it. Some \nin the U.S. Senate and some around the country have said: ``If it isn't \nmandatory, it's not labeling,'' or that the current mandatory labeling \nlaw that passed in the 2002 Farm Bill is the only way labeling will \nwork. I strongly disagree.\n  The current mandatory law is an example of a good idea gone awry. The \nwarning signs of the negative impact of this law have long been on the \nhorizon. On a number of occasions the Government Accountability Office \npublished reports and studies, and testified before Congress about the \nburdens of mandatory country-of-origin labeling.\n  In 1999--3 years before the current mandatory labeling law was \npassed--GAO testified before Congress that ``There is going to be \nsignificant costs associated with compliance and enforcement'' of \nmandatory labeling. At that same hearing, a representative of the \nClinton administration testified that ``There are a variety of \nregulatory regimes for country-of-origin labeling that could be \nadopted.''\n  In 2000, the GAO released another study indicating that ``U.S. \nPackers, processors, and grocers would, to the extent possible, pass \ntheir compliance costs back to their suppliers--U.S. cattle and sheep \nranchers--in the form of lower prices or forward to consumers in the \nform of higher retail prices.''\n  As if that was not enough, again in 2000, the USDA under President \nClinton released another report which stated: ``[C]ountry-of-origin \nlabeling is certain to impose at least some costs on an industry which \nwill either be passed back to producers in the form of lower prices or \nforward to consumers via higher prices. There would also be compliance \nand enforcement cost to the government. The extent of these costs would \nvary depending on the nature of the regulatory scheme and the amount of \nenforcement and compliance action.''\n  Yet despite the warning signs, the current law passed as part of the \n2002 Farm Bill.\n  When USDA issued the proposed rule, it contained a cost-benefit \nanalysis that said implementation could cost up to $4 billion--with no \nquantifiable benefit. The rule was followed by a letter from the \nDirector of Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Dr. John \nGraham, which said ``this is one of the most burdensome rules to be \nreviewed by this administration.''\n  And so, I am not surprised by how upset many of my constituents are, \nand that they have come asked me to do something about the burdens this \nlaw imposes on them. They ask: ``How can something so popular, like \nmarketing and promoting U.S. products be so expensive?'' I am \nintroducing this bill to help relieve that burden.\n  There has to be a better way to market and promote U.S. products, and \nI believe the Meat Promotion Act of 2005 will provide a better \nsolution.\n  Some have said that voluntary labeling is like a voluntary speed \nlimit--that it won't work. On what basis do they make that claim? \nProducts like Certified Angus Beef, Angus Pride, Rancher's Reserve; \nthese are all labeled on a volunteer basis under existing USDA \nprograms. If producers want to have their products labeled, then they \nshould participate in a voluntary labeling program rather than impose a \ncostly burden on entire segments of our Nation's economy.\n  Others have argued that this is about food safety. Let's not kid \nourselves: country-of-origin labeling is a product-marketing program, \nperiod. The security of our Nation's food supply is assured by a \nscience-based, food-safety inspection system, not by labeling programs. \nIn fact, the mandatory labeling law exempts food service and poultry. \nIf this debate is about food safety, why are all poultry and the \nmajority of beef imports for foodservice allowed an exemption? These \nexemptions clearly demonstrate food safety is not at issue.\n  Some have also pointed to the mandatory labeling law now in effect on \nseafood and fish, saying that the sky has not fallen on those \nindustries. That is subject to interpretation. GAO analysis of the \nseafood provisions of the mandatory labeling law shows that the seafood \nindustry could face up to $89 million in start-up costs and up to $6.2 \nmillion in additional costs in year 10 of the program. Likewise, USDA \nestimated total recordkeeping at $44.6 million for the first year and \n$24.4 million in subsequent years. The Office of Management and Budget \nfound the rule to be an ``economically significant'' regulatory action \nand USDA believes the rule would adversely affect--in a substantial \nway--a key sector of the economy. GAO B-294914.\n  What do these numbers mean in a practical way? It means that these \nexpenses are paid for out of the pockets of hardworking Americans, to \nfund a program that could be more efficient, more effective, and less \ncostly.\n  I stand with the livestock producers that want to market and promote \nthe products they are proud to raise. I believe they should be able to \nmarket and promote their products as born, raised, and processed in the \nUnited States, and I believe the Meat Promotion Act of 2005 provides \nthe most effective and efficient opportunity for them to do so, while \nadding value to their bottom line and helping the economy of rural \nAmerica.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BUNNING (for himself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 1334. A bill entitled ``The Professional Sports Integrity and \nAccountability Act''; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation and the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the efforts of my \ncolleague Senator Bunning in holding professional sports leagues in the \nUnited States to a higher standard with respect to testing their \nathletes for performance-enhancing drugs. Senator Bunning's bill, ``The \nProfessional Sports Integrity and Accountability Act,'' is another step \ntoward holding professional sports leagues accountable as custodians of \nour Nation's pastimes. I have cosponsored a similar bill with Senator \nMcCain, and I look forward to working with both of them in the effort \nto rid professional sports of performance-enhancing drugs and setting a \npositive example for our youth who are using these substances at an \nalarming rate.\n  Over the past few years, the Commerce Committee has taken a series of \nactions to review the issue of performance-enhancing drug use at all \nlevels of athletic competition, professional and amateur. The results \nof that review have been alarming. The evidence is clear that an \nincreasing number of young amateur and U.S. Olympic athletes are using \nthese substances for a multitude of reasons, but primarily to enhance \nathletic performance. Some experts suggest that many of these young \nathletes seek to emulate their professional sports heroes and are drawn \nto whatever it takes to achieve similar athletic greatness. For those \nskeptics who question this link and doubt the powerful effect that \nathletes have on the lives of kids, I remind them of the five-fold \nincrease in the sales of the steroid-like substance androstenedione--\nbetter known as ``andro''--that occurred after Mark McGwire admitted to \nusing the substance in 1998 while chasing Major League Baseball's home \nrun record.\n\n[[Page S7634]]\n\nSince then, the problem of harmful supplement use among children and \nteenagers has reached epidemic proportions.\n  In 2004, more than 300,000 high school students used anabolic \nsteroids, which are scheduled as a controlled substances in the United \nStates. Evidence shows that teenagers are using these substances not \nonly for athletic performance enhancement, but also for vanity. Recent \nnews reports have indicated that when surveyed, an estimated 5 percent \nof high school girls and 7 percent of middle school girls admitted \nusing anabolic steroids at some point in their lives. Steroid use has \ndoubled among high school students since the early 1990s.\n  The adverse health consequences associated with such use are \nindisputable. Medical experts warn that the effects on children and \nteenagers include stunted growth, scarring acne, hormonal imbalances, \nliver and kidney damage, as well as an increased risk of heart disease \nand stroke later in life. Psychologically, steroids have been \nassociated with increased aggression, suicide, and a greater propensity \nto commit serious crimes.\n  Notwithstanding the dire health effects of anabolic steroids or \nsteroid-like substances, the use of any performance-enhancing substance \nfor the sole purpose of gaining a competitive edge over an opponent is \nunfair. Professional sports leagues must be held to the highest \nstandard and be held accountable to their players, American consumers \nwho pay to see a fair competition on the playing field, and the young \nathletes who are led by the example of professional athletes.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. \n        Bingaman):\n  S. 1335. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \npreserve access to appeals before administrative law judges under the \nmedicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Justice for \nMedicare Beneficiaries Act of 2005, legislation that will ensure that \nMedicare beneficiaries who are denied health-related benefits can \nappeal these denials in a meaningful way. Very simply, this initiative \nwill ensure that Medicare beneficiaries have access to timely, \nimpartial, and in-person hearings before Administrative Law Judges.\n  Sec. 931 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and \nModernization Act requires the transfer of the Medicare appeals process \nfrom the Social Security Administration (SSA) to the Department of \nHealth and Human Services (HHS). A proposed rule recently put forth \nindicates that current HHS plans to bring about this transfer will \nsignificantly and negatively affect Medicare beneficiaries' ability to \nseek redress from the denial of benefits such as access to prescription \nmedicines, home health services, and services provided at skilled \nnursing facilities.\n  Specifically, the Administration's proposed transfer plan, slated to \ngo into effect in only a handful of days on July 1, will reduce the \nnumber of sites where these appeal hearings can take place to four from \nthe more than 140 sites currently operating nationwide. Today, Medicare \nbeneficiaries that have filed coverage appeals are granted a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). Under the proposed transfer \nplan, Medicare beneficiaries will now have their hearings heard via \nvideo- or teleconference (VTC) and will only be allowed to appear in \nperson by request and if HHS determines that ``special or extraordinary \ncircumstances exist.'' Moreover, beneficiaries granted an in-person \nhearing would not be assured that their cases would be heard within the \n90-day window currently mandated by law. Lastly, the proposed transfer \nplan will endanger the independence and impartiality of Administrative \nLaw Judges by requiring them to defer to program guidance provided by \nthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) rather than on the \nMedicare statute and regulations, as they currently do.\n  Central to our system of justice is the right of aggrieved parties to \nappear before an impartial judge in person to have their cases heard. \nAppearing face-to-face before an impartial trier of fact is the best \nway to ensure that a full and fair hearing occurs. In person hearings \nallow parties to fully make their case. At the same time, they allow \njudges to best evaluate the demeanor and condition of the parties, and \nother aspects of a case. The Administration's proposed rule \ntransferring the Medicare appeals process from SSA to HHS greatly \nendangers this right by gutting the current practice of guaranteeing \nthe right of Medicare beneficiaries to appear in person before an ALJ \nwhen having their appeals heard and instead will now presume that these \nhearings will be heard via video- or teleconference.\n  Often when we talk about the denial of Medicare benefits, we are \ntalking about the denial of services that literally have the ability to \nsave lives. Medicare provides a critical safety net for millions of \nelderly and disabled beneficiaries and the proposed transfer plan's \nalmost wholesale reliance on novel VTC technology may endanger the \nability of many Medicare beneficiaries to accurately and personally \nportray the severity of their own health conditions.\n  The Justice for Medicare Beneficiaries Act of 2005 will ensure those \nMedicare beneficiaries that have filed coverage appeals have access to \ntimely, impartial, and in-person hearings before Administrative Law \nJudges. Specifically, this initiative will ensure that Medicare appeals \nwill be heard in person before an ALJ, as they presently are. While all \nMedicare beneficiaries will be entitled to appear in person for their \nhearing, any beneficiary may choose to have their hearing heard via \nvideo- or teleconference.\n  The legislation that I introduce today is in no way designed to \nprevent the adoption of the promising technology represented by VTC. \nRather, this initiative simply seeks to preserve the critically \nimportant ability of Medicare beneficiaries to appear before the very \njudges charged with hearing their coverage appeals. By preventing the \ngreat majority of Medicare beneficiaries from appearing in person \nbefore the judge hearing their Medicare appeals, the Administration's \nproposed plan will greatly harm their ability to accurately and \ncompletely present all of the facts relevant to their case. And while I \nunderstand that many Medicare beneficiaries will choose to have their \nappeals heard via either video- or teleconference, I believe that we \nmust preserve for Medicare beneficiaries the ability to appear in \nperson before a judge when their cases are heard.\n  The legislation will also require that all Medicare coverage appeal \nhearings, regardless of whether a Medicare beneficiary appears in \nperson or chooses to appear via video- or teleconference, will be heard \nwithin 90 days as mandated by the Benefits Improvement and Protection \nAct of 2000. All Medicare beneficiaries deserve to have their appeals \nheard in a timely manner regardless of whether their cases are heard in \nperson or via utilizing VTC technology.\n  The Justice for Medicare Beneficiaries Act will also address the \nAdministration's plans to reduce the number of sites where Medicare \nappeal hearings may be heard in person from the more than 140 sites \ncurrently available to four. This legislation will require at least one \nsite for the hearing of in-person Medicare appeals in each state, the \nDistrict of Columbia, and territory, with the nation's five largest \nstates featuring two hearing sites geographically distributed \nthroughout the state.\n  Lastly, this legislation will ensure the independence and \nimpartiality of Administrative Law Judges by relieving them of the \nproposed transfer plan's mandate to grant ``substantial deference'' to \nCMS program guidance. Medicare beneficiaries appealing coverage \ndecisions should be fully confident that the judges deciding their \nappeals are bound only by the merits of their case and not undue \npressure from agency of administration interference.\n  I want to thank Senators Kennedy, Kerry, and Bingaman for joining me \nin sponsoring this important initiative. The Justice for Medicare \nBeneficiaries Act is also supported by a number of national and local \norganizations dedicated to preserving the continued ability of Medicare \nbeneficiaries to access needed health care services. Endorsing the \nlegislation that I introduce today are the Center for Medicare Advocacy \nlocated in my own state of Connecticut, the National Health Law \nProgram, the National Senior Citizens Law Center, the Medicare Advocacy \nProject of Vermont Legal Aid, the Medicare Advocacy Project of Greater\n\n[[Page S7635]]\n\nBoston Legal Services, and the Senior Citizens' Law Office of \nAlbuquerque, NM.\n  In Congress we far too rarely have the opportunity to stave off \nproblems before they occur. Rather, too often we are forced to involve \nourselves in matters only after they have already wreaked havoc on the \nlives of our constituents. With passage of the Justice for Medicare \nBeneficiaries Act of 2005, we have the opportunity to avoid the adverse \nimpact that the Administration's proposed transfer plan will likely \nhave on Medicare beneficiaries. This legislation will preserve for our \nnation's 41 million Medicare beneficiaries the ability to timely appear \nin person before judges who will impartially determine which health \ncare services they're entitled to receive under Medicare. Medicare \nbeneficiaries deserve no less than the vital protections offered by \nthis act and I ask for the support of my colleagues for this critically \nimportant initiative.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI (for himself and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 1337. A bill to restore fairness and reliability to the medical \njustice system and promote patient safety by fostering alternatives to \ncurrent medical tort litigation, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleague Senator \nBaucus from Montana to introduce a bill that will help bring about a \nmore reliable system of medical justice for all Americans.\n  In the last Congress, we had three robust debates on a critical \nissue--medical liability reform. Though a majority of the Members of \nthis body wanted to begin working to pass legislation, we didn't have \nthe 60 Senators necessary to invoke cloture and begin the real work on \nthe bills. That was disappointing, because skyrocketing medical \nliability insurance premiums are forcing doctors to move their \npractices to States with better legal environments and lower premiums. \nThis is endangering the availability of critical healthcare services in \nmany areas of Wyoming and other states.\n  Throughout our debate, I heard many of my colleagues say that they \nwanted to work on this issue, but that they simply could not support \nthe bill as it stood. While I disagreed with their positions then, I \nrespected their opposition. I also trust that they sincerely wanted to \nhelp solve our Nation's medical liability and litigation crisis.\n  During those debates, I noticed something interesting. While we \nargued the ``pros and cons'' of the bills, no one stood up to defend \nour current system of medical litigation. In fact, even some of the \nlawyers in this body agreed that our medical litigation system needs \nreform.\n  Why didn't we hear anyone defend the merits of our current medical \nlitigation system? It's because our system doesn't work. It simply \ndoesn't work for patients or for healthcare providers.\n  Compensation to patients injured by healthcare errors is neither \nprompt nor fair. The randomness and delay associated with medical \nlitigation does not contribute to timely, reasonable compensation for \nmost injured patients. Some injured patients get huge jury awards, \nwhile many others get nothing at all.\n  Let's look at the facts. In 1991, a group of researchers published a \nstudy in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study, known as the \nHarvard Medical Practice Study, was the basis for the Institute of \nMedicine's estimate that nearly 100,000 people die every year from \nhealthcare errors.\n  As part of their study, the researchers reviewed the medical records \nof a random sample of more than 31,000 patients in New York State. They \nmatched those records with statewide data on medical malpractice \nclaims. The researchers found that nearly 30 percent of injuries caused \nby medical negligence resulted in temporary disability, permanent \ndisability or death. However, less than 2 percent of those who were \ninjured by medical negligence filed a claim. These figures suggest that \nmost people who suffer negligent injuries don't receive any \ncompensation.\n  When a patient does decide to litigate, only a few recover anything. \nOnly one of every ten medical malpractice cases actually goes to trial, \nand of those cases, plaintiffs win less than one of every five. In \naddition, patients who file suit and are ultimately successful must \nwait a long time for their compensation--the average length of a \nmedical malpractice action filed in state court is about 30 months.\n  While the vast majority of malpractice cases that go to trial are \nsettled before the court hands down a verdict, the settlements even \nthen don't guarantee that patients are compensated fairly, particularly \nafter legal fees are subtracted. Research shows that for every dollar \npaid in malpractice insurance premiums, about 40 cents in compensation \nis actually paid to the plaintiff--the rest goes for legal fees, court \ncosts, and other administrative expenditures.\n  To sum up: most patients injured by negligence don't file claims or \nreceive compensation. Few of those that do file claims and go to court \nrecover anything, and those who are successful wait a long time for \ntheir compensation. And those who settle out of court end up receiving \nonly 40 cents for every dollar that healthcare providers pay in \nliability insurance premiums.\n  It's hard to say that our medical litigation system does right by \npatients in light of those facts. Unfortunately, our system doesn't \nwork for healthcare providers either.\n  Earlier, I spoke about those Harvard researchers who found that fewer \nthan 2 percent of those who were injured by medical negligence even \nfiled a claim. As they reviewed the medical records for their study, \nthe researchers also found another interesting fact--most of the \nproviders against whom claims were eventually filed were not negligent \nat all.\n  That's right--most providers who were sued had not committed a \nnegligent act.\n  In matching the records they reviewed to data on malpractice claims, \nthe Harvard researchers found 47 actual malpractice claims. In only 8 \nof the 47 claims did they find evidence that medical malpractice had \ncaused an injury. Even more amazingly, the physician reviewers found no \nevidence of any medical injury, negligent or not, in 26 of the 47 \nclaims. However, 40 percent of these cases where they found no evidence \nof negligence nonetheless resulted in a payment by the provider. \nBasically, the researchers found no positive relationship between \nmedical negligence and compensation.\n  That study was based on 1984 data. The same group of researchers \nconducted another study in Colorado and Utah in 1992, and they found \nthe same thing. As in the 1984 study, they found that only 3 percent of \npatients who suffered an injury as a result of negligence actually \nsued. And again, physician reviewers could not find negligence in most \nof the cases in which lawsuits were filed.\n\n  Now, I assume that the patients who sued had either an adverse \nmedical outcome, or at least an outcome that was less satisfactory than \nthe patient expected. But our medical litigation system is not supposed \nto compensate patients for adverse outcomes or dissatisfaction--it's \nsupposed to compensate patients who are victims of negligent behavior. \nIt's supposed to be a deterrent to substandard medical care.\n  It's not fair to doctors and hospitals that they must pay to defend \nagainst meritless lawsuits. Nor is it fair that they must face a choice \nbetween settling for a small sum, even if they aren't at fault, so that \nthey avoid getting sucked into the whirlpool of our medical litigation \nsystem.\n  It's not hard to understand why physicians and hospitals and their \ninsurers want to stay out of court. When they lose, the decisions are \nincreasingly resulting in mega-awards based on subjective ``non-\neconomic'' damages. The number of awards exceeding $1 million grew by \n50 percent between the periods of 1994-1996 and 1999-2000. Today, more \nthan half of all jury awards exceed $1 million.\n  As a result, when a patient suffers a bad outcome and sues, providers \nhave an incentive to settle the case out of court, even if the provider \nisn't at fault. But is this how our medical litigation system is \nsupposed to work--as a tool for shaking down our healthcare providers?\n  Let's face it--our medical litigation system is broken. It doesn't \nwork for\n\n[[Page S7636]]\n\npatients or providers. Even worse, it replaces the trust in the \nprovider-patient relationship with distrust.\n  Then, when courts and juries render verdicts with huge awards that \nbear no relation to the conduct of the defendants, this destabilizes \nthe insurance markets and sends premiums skyrocketing. This forces many \nphysicians to curtail, move or drop their practices, leaving patients \nwithout access to necessary medical care. This is a particular problem \nin states like Wyoming, where we traditionally struggle with recruiting \ndoctors and other healthcare providers.\n  Perhaps we could live with this flawed system if litigation served to \nimprove quality or safety, but it doesn't. Litigation discourages the \nexchange of critical information that could be used to improve the \nquality and safety of patient care. The constant threat of litigation \nalso drives the inefficient, costly and even dangerous practice of \n``defensive medicine.''\n  Yes, indeed, defensive medicine is dangerous. A recent study found \nthat one of every 1200 children who receive a CAT scan may die later in \nlife from radiation-induced cancer. Knowing this puts a physician faced \nwith anxious parents in a difficult situation. Does the doctor use his \nor her professional judgment and tell the parents of a sick child not \nto worry, or does the doctor order the CAT scan and subject the child \nto radiation that is probably unnecessary, just to provide some \nprotection against a possible lawsuit?\n  We have a medical litigation system in which many patients who are \nhurt by negligent actions receive no compensation for their loss. Those \nwho do receive compensation end up with about 40 cents of every premium \ndollar after legal fees and other costs are subtracted. And the \nlikelihood and the outcomes of lawsuits and settlements bear little \nrelation to whether or not a healthcare provider was at fault.\n  We like to say that justice is blind. With respect to our medical \nlitigation system, I would say that justice is absent and nowhere to be \nfound.\n  During our debates in the last Congress, I said that the current \nmedical liability crisis and the shortcomings of our medical litigation \nsystem make it clear that it is time for a major change. I also said \nthat regardless of how we voted, we all should work toward replacing \nthe current medical tort liability scheme with a more reliable and \npredictable system of medical justice.\n  Today, Senator Baucus and I are introducing a bill that would help \nachieve that goal.\n  Most of us are familiar with the report on medical errors from the \nInstitute of Medicine, also known as the IOM. Many of us may be less \nfamiliar with another report that the IOM published in 2003. That \nreport is called ``Fostering Rapid Advances in Healthcare: Learning \nfrom System Demonstrations.''\n  Our Secretary of Health and Human Services at that time, Tommy \nThompson, challenged the IOM to identify bold ideas that would \nchallenge conventional thinking about some of the most vexing problems \nfacing our healthcare system. In response, an IOM committee developed \nthis report, which identified a set of demonstration projects that \ncommittee members felt would break new ground and yield a very high \nreturn-on-investment in terms of dollars and health.\n  Medical liability was one of the areas upon which the IOM committee \nfocused. The IOM suggested that the federal government should support \ndemonstration projects in the states. These demonstrations should be \nbased on ``replacing tort liability with a system of patient-centered \nand safety-focused non-judicial compensation.''\n  The bill we are introducing today is in the spirit of this IOM \nreport. This bill, the Fair and Reliable Medical Justice Act, would \nauthorize funding for States to create demonstration programs to test \nalternatives to current medical tort litigation.\n  The funding to States under this bill would cover planning grants for \ndeveloping proposals based on the models or other innovative ideas. \nFunding to States would also include the initial costs of getting the \nalternatives up and running.\n  The Fair and Reliable Medical Justice Act would require participating \nstates and the Federal Government to collaborate in continuous \nevaluations of the results of the alternatives as compared to \ntraditional tort litigation. This way, all States and the federal \ngovernment can learn from new approaches.\n  By funding demonstration projects, I believe Congress could enable \nStates to experiment with and learn from ideas that could provide long-\nterm solutions to the current medical liability and litigation crisis.\n  In introducing this bill, I wanted to provide some alternative ideas \nthat would contribute to the debate. As a result, the bill describes \nthree models to which states could look in designing their \nalternatives.\n  For instance, a State could provide healthcare providers and \norganizations with immunity from lawsuits if they disclose an error \nthat results in an injury and make a timely offer to compensate an \ninjured patient for his or her actual net economic loss, plus a payment \nfor pain and suffering if experts deem such a payment to be \nappropriate. This could give a healthcare provider who makes an honest \nmistake the chance to make amends financially with a patient, without \nthe provider fearing that their honesty would land them in a lawsuit.\n  Another idea would be for a state to set up classes of avoidable \ninjuries and a schedule of compensation for them, and then establish an \nadministrative board to resolve claims related to those injuries. A \nscientifically rigorous process of identifying preventable injuries and \nsetting appropriate compensation would be preferable to the randomness \nof the current system.\n  Still another option would be for a state to establish a special \nhealthcare court for adjudicating medical malpractice cases. For this \nidea to work, the State would need to ensure that the presiding judges \nhave expertise in and an understanding of healthcare, and allow them to \nmake binding rulings on issues like causation compensation, and \nstandards of care.\n  We already have specialized courts for complicated issues like taxes \nand highly charged issues like substance abuse and domestic violence. \nWith all the flaws in our current medical litigation system, perhaps we \nshould consider special courts for the complex and emotional issue of \nmedical malpractice.\n  I believe one thing in our medical liability debate is absolutely \nclear--people are demanding change. The States are debating liability \nreform, and a number of states have enacted new laws. States are \nheeding this call for change, and Congress should support those \nefforts.\n  My own State, Wyoming, had had a number of lively legislative debates \non medical liability reform over the past few years, but we have a \nconstitutional amendment that prohibits limits on the amounts that can \nbe recovered through lawsuits. The Wyoming Senate has considered bills \nrecently to amend our State's constitution to create a commission on \nhealthcare errors. That commission would have the power to review \nclaims, decide if healthcare negligence had occurred, and determine the \ncompensation for the death or injury according to a schedule or formula \nprovided by law.\n  According to the key sponsor of these bills, Senator Charlie Scott, \none of the biggest obstacles to passage is the uncertainty surrounding \nthis new idea. No one has any basis for knowing what a proper schedule \nor formula for compensation would be. No one knows how much the system \nmight cost, or how much injured patients would recover compared to what \nthey recover now.\n  Senator Scott wrote me to say that federal support for finding \nanswers to these questions might help the bill's sponsors sufficiently \nrespond to the legitimate concerns of their fellow Wyoming legislators. \nWe should be helping state legislators like Senator Scott develop \nthoughtful and innovative ideas such as the one he has proposed. That's \none of the reasons I am offering this bill.\n  Clearly, the American people and their elected representatives have \nidentified the need to reform our current medical litigation system. \nThere is a real medical liability crisis, and Congress needs to act \nsooner rather than later.\n  My cosponsor Senator Baucus and I voted differently on medical \nliability reform in the last Congress, but we\n\n[[Page S7637]]\n\nboth agree that we ought to lend a hand to States that are working to \nchange their current medical litigation systems and to develop creative \nalternatives that could work much better for patients and providers. \nThe States have been policy pioneers in many areas--workers' \ncompensation, welfare reform, and electricity deregulation, to name \nthree. Medical litigation should be the next item on the agenda of the \nlaboratories of democracy that are our 50 States.\n  No one questions the need to restore reliability to our medical \njustice system. But how do we begin the process? One way is to foster \ninnovation by encouraging States to develop more rational and \npredictable methods for resolving healthcare injury claims. And that is \nwhat the Fair and Reliable Medical Justice Act aims to do.\n  In the long run, we would all be better off with a more reliable \nsystem of medical justice than we have today. I know that my fellow \nSenators recognize this, so I hope my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle will work with me and Senator Baucus on this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1337\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator ENZI in \nintroducing the Fair and Reliable Medical Justice Act of 2005. We have \ndebated the medical liability issue in this chamber for years now. But \nthe Senate has failed to take action to make the situation better. We \nneed to deal with the issue of rising liability costs, and I think this \nbill is a good place to start.\n\n[[Page S7639]]\n\n  One of my top priorities in the Senate is ensuring appropriate access \nto affordable, quality health care. In a rural State such as Montana, \nwhere health care providers are often few and far between, that is a \ntall order. It is a job that is made all the harder by rising medical \nliability insurance premiums.\n  To ensure proper access to care, we need to make certain that our \nhealth care providers can afford their medical liability insurance. We \nalso need to make sure that patients who are harmed by medical mistakes \nhave access to timely, reasonable compensation for their injuries.\n  The Fair and Reliable Medical Justice Act promotes the testing of \nalternatives to current medical tort liability litigation. It aims to \nincrease the number of injured patients who receive compensation for \ntheir injuries, and make such compensation more accurate and more \ntimely, all at lower administrative costs than current systems. The \nbill also encourages patient safety by promoting disclosure of medical \nerrors, unlike the current system which does not encourage disclosure.\n  The Fair and Reliable Medical Justice Act would establish State-based \ndemonstration programs to help States test alternative systems of \nhealth care-related dispute resolution under three different models: \nearly disclosure and compensation; administrative determination of \ncompensation; and special health care courts. Under the bill, states \nmay develop other alternative plans for resolving health care related \ndisputes as well.\n  The first model involves a system of early disclosure, which \nencourages providers to disclose medical errors that harm patients and \noffer just compensation for injuries. This model would maintain \npatients' access to the traditional legal system if claims cannot be \nresolved by early disclosure, or in cases resulting from criminal or \nintentional harm or fraud.\n  The second model would establish a board made up of providers and \nhealth care organizations, advocates, and attorneys. The board would \nestablish classes of avoidable injuries and determine compensation \nrates for each, including economic and non-economic losses, and \nattorneys' fees.\n  The third model involves special health care courts, presided over by \njudges with special health care expertise, and assisted by independent \nexperts. The judges would be subject to the same criteria as other \nState judges and sit on the court voluntarily.\n  These models are based on innovative efforts currently underway in \nthe private sector and in some States, where success is already being \nachieved. I think it is time for us to try to encourage more innovation \nand expand the range of options being considered. State-based \ndemonstrations provide a great setting for experimentation and \nlearning. The Institute of Medicine suggested as much in its 2002 \nreport entitled ``Fostering Rapid Advances in Health Care: Learning \nfrom System Demonstrations.''\n  I thank Senator Enzi for his leadership on this issue. I am proud to \nhave worked with him to develop legislation that I believe will enhance \npatient safety. It is unacceptable that around 100,000 Americans die \nannually as a result of medical errors. And it is unacceptable that \nmany patients hurt by medical errors receive no compensation for their \ninjuries\n  This bill is a good opportunity for us to make progress on both \nfronts--to look at the medical liability issue from a new perspective, \nthrough a set of commonsense pilot projects centered on improving \npatient safety. I urge my colleagues to support this important effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 1338. A bill to require the Secretary of the Interior, acting \nthrough the Bureau of Reclamation and the United States Geological \nSurvey, to conduct a study on groundwater resources in the State of \nAlaska, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a measure of \nbenefit to my home State of Alaska, the Alaska Water Resources Act of \n2005. The importance of water resource data collection to a State that \nhas a resource-based economy cannot be overstated. Economic development \nis predicated on access to an adequate water supply, and in my State \nthere is inadequate hydrologic data upon which to secure both economic \ndevelopment and the health and welfare of Alaskan citizens.\n  Alaska is an amazing State from a hydrological viewpoint. It is home \nto more than 3 million lakes--only about 100 being larger than 10 \nsquare miles--more than 12,000 rivers and uncounted thousands of \nstreams, creeks and ponds. Together these water bodies hold about one-\nthird of all the fresh water found in the United States.\n  Alaska is home to a number of large rivers. The Yukon, which \noriginates in western Canada, runs 1,400 miles--discharging from 25,000 \ncubic feet of water per second in early spring to more than 600,000 \ncubic feet per second in May during the spring thaw. The Yukon drains \nroughly 330,000 square miles of Alaska and Canada, about one-third of \nthe State. Besides the Yukon, Alaska is home to nine other major rivers \nand creeks all running more than 300 miles in length: the Porcupine, \nKoyukuk, Kuskokwim, Tanana, Innoko, Colville, Noatak, Kobuk and Birch \nCreek.\n  Alaska residents from early spring to fall face substantial flood \nthreats, from spring flooding caused by breakup and ice damming to \nfall's heavy rains, but the State has fewer than 100 stream gaging \nstations operated by the U.S. Geological Survey--Alaska having less \nthan 10 percent of the stream flow information that is taken for \ngranted by all other States in the Nation. Alaska averages one working \ngage for each 10,000 square miles, while, as an example, Pacific \nNorthwest States average one gage for each 365 square miles. To \nemphasize the lack of data now available for Alaska, I would point out \nthat to equal the stream gage density of the Pacific Northwest States, \nmy State would need to have over 1,600 total gage sites.\n  Alaska also supports the Nation's least modern and undeveloped \npotable water distribution system. Water for Alaska towns outside of \nthe more densely populated ``Railbelt'' comes predominately from \nsurface water sources Surface water sources often result in supply/\nstorage problems since these surface sources freeze and are unavailable \nfor up to half the year. The chances for water-borne contaminants to \naffect potable water supplies, including fecal matter from Alaska's \nplentiful wildlife populations, human waste from inadequate or \nnonexistent sewage treatment facilities, and natural mineral deposits \n(natural arsenic levels in mineralized zone creeks frequently exceeding \nEPA standards) are present and increasing. In areas that predominately \ndepend on groundwater sources, such as the ``Railbelt,'' there is only \nvery limited knowledge of the nature and extent of the aquifers that \nsupport those critical groundwater supplies. Extensive permafrost \nfurther complicates the potential for adverse impacts to Alaska. In \nportions of Southcentral Alaska where there is a dependence on \ngroundwater as the source for an adequate healthy water supply, the \navailability of that supply is starting to be in jeopardy. Allocations \nof water need to be based on scientific data, and the data needed upon \nwhich the allocations are made is unavailable. Users of water are only \nbeginning to realize the potential conflicts that may arise, and the \nlimits on future economic development that may result from inadequate \nknowledge of the water resource, particularly in the Matanuska-Susitna \nBorough, on the Kenai Peninsula and to a lesser extent in portions of \nthe Municipality of Anchorage where groundwater provided by wells is a \ncrucial part of the State's water distribution system and where there \nis little known about the size, capacity, extent and recharge \ncapability of the aquifers that these wells tap.\n  Alaska, according to the Alaska Department of Environmental \nConservation, still has some 16,000 homes in 71 generally Native \nvillages not being served by piped water or enclosed water haul \nsystems. There are still 55 villages in Alaska where up to 29 percent \nof the residents are not served by sanitary water systems, with more \nthan 60 percent of residents not being served in 16 villages. Even \nthough since Statehood the State and Federal governments have spent \n$1.3 billion on rural water-sanitation system improvements in Alaska, \nthe state has an estimated need for nearly $650 million in\n\n[[Page S7640]]\n\nadditional funding to complete installation of a modern water-\nsanitation system.\n  Planning and engineering for those locations cannot be completed \nwithout better information as to the availability and extent of supply \nof water and better analysis of new technologies that could be used for \nwater system installations, including possible desalination for some \nisland and coastal communities.\n  For all these reasons, today I am introducing legislation authorizing \nthe Department of the Interior's Commissioner of Reclamation and the \nDirector of the U.S. Geological Survey to conduct a series of water \nresource studies in Alaska. The studies will include a survey of water \ntreatment needs and technologies including desalination treatment, \nwhich may be applicable to the water resources development in Alaska. \nThe study will review the need for enhancement of the National \nStreamflow Information Program administered by the U.S. Geological \nSurvey. The Streamflow review will determine whether more stream gaging \nstations are necessary for flood forecasting, aiding resource \nextraction, determining the risk to the state's transportation system \nand for wildfire management. Groundwater resources will also be further \nevaluated and documented to determine the availability of water, the \nquality of that groundwater, and the extent of the aquifers in urban \nareas.\n  This type of study, already conducted for most all other Sates in the \nNation, should help Alaska better plan and design water systems and \ntransportation infrastructure and also better prepare for floods and \nsummer wildfires.\n  There is literally ``water, water everywhere'' in Alaska, but too \noften, especially in communities such as Ketchikan that take water from \nsurface sources, or the rapidly growing Mat-Su Valley, there may be \nless water to drink during unusually dry summers, There is a real and \ngrowing problem of maintaining an adequate supply of sufficient, pure \nwater. This problem is only going to grow with a growing population and \neconomy. This bill is designed to provide more information to help \ncommunities plan for future water needs and to help State officials \nplan for flood and fire safety concerns and economic development.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Jeffords, Mrs. Boxer, \n        Mr. Kerry, Mr. Biden, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Carper, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Reid, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. \n        Clinton, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Harkin, \n        Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Obama, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Levin, \n        Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Reed, Mr. \n        Sarbanes, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Akaka, and Ms. Snowe):\n  S.J. Res. 20. A joint resolution disapproving a rule promulgated by \nthe Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to delist coal \nand oil-direct utility units from the source category list under the \nClean Air Act; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, along with Senator Collins and 28 of our \ncolleagues, today I am introducing this resolution to halt the Bush \nadministration's flawed and dangerous new rule on toxic mercury \nemissions. I am pleased that another leading cosponsor of this \nresolution is the ranking member of the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works, Senator Jeffords.\n  The Bush administration's new rule will continue to allow mercury, a \nsubstance so toxic that it causes birth defects and IQ loss, to \ncontinue to poison children and pregnant women. This disastrous rule \nshould not be allowed to stand as the law of the land.\n  The bipartisan work that produced the Clean Air Act and the 1990 \namendments established a process for us to begin cleaning up the toxic \nmercury spewing out of dirty power plants across the country. The 1990 \namendments require the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to control \neach power plant's emissions of mercury and other toxics by 2008 at the \nlatest. The act requires each plant to use the ``maximum achievable \ncontrol technology'' on every generating unit. That is the law of the \nland. Anything less means more pollution.\n  But instead of working to enforce and implement the Clean Air Act, as \ntwo previous administrations had, the Bush administration has turned \nthe Clean Air Act on its head. With this rule the administration \nrevokes a 2000 EPA finding that it is ``necessary and appropriate'' to \nrequire that each power plant apply technology to reduce mercury \nemissions.\n  Let me repeat those plain, startling facts: By revoking the earlier \nEPA finding and deciding instead to coddle the biggest mercury \npolluters, the administration is saying it is no longer necessary or \nappropriate to adequately control mercury emissions. Although I am \nsomewhat impressed that they can make this statement with straight \nfaces, I am appalled at their audacious disregard for the health of the \nAmerican people, and, like the scientific community, I am baffled by \ntheir gymnastic arguments.\n  The plain and simple truth is that this rule will allow more mercury \ninto our environment than does the current law. Hundreds of the oldest, \ndirtiest power plants will not even control mercury emissions for more \nthan a decade. That is what this rule gives us: More pollution, for \nlonger than the Clean Air Act allows.\n  This rule is all the more shameful because the evidence of public \nhealth and environmental damage from mercury and other toxics is clear \nenough for action right now. We do not need to wait 10 or 20 years to \nknow the facts about mercury's threats to human health. In fact EPA \nitself admits these threats. Look at EPA's own estimate of the number \nof newborns at risk of elevated mercury exposure, which has doubled to \n630,000. EPA also found that 1 in 6 pregnant women has mercury levels \nin her blood above EPA's safe threshold. The National Academy of \nSciences has confirmed scientific research showing that maternal \nconsumption of unsafe levels of mercury in fish can cause neuro-\ndevelopmental harm in children, resulting in learning disabilities, \npoor motor function, mental retardation, seizures and cerebral palsy.\n\n  Yet it seems the majority in Congress and this administration want to \navoid any public daylight on this flawed rule. The Environment and \nPublic Works Committee has refused to even hold a single hearing on \nthis rule. Their aim is to keep the public in the dark, and I would \nguess that most Americans in fact do not yet know what EPA and the big \npolluters have been up to with this rule.\n  One reason for the administration's lack of candor clearly is the \ndiscovery that this rule has polluting industries' fingerprints all \nover it. EPA's first proposal for these rules lifted exact texts from \nmemorandum provided by utility industry lobbyists. Another reason may \nbe because the American people would find a process where the lobbyists \nare shut in and the public is shut out, where the scientific and \neconomic analysis was manipulated, and where the public's health was \nignored.\n  But the administration's arrogance does not stop there. EPA's own \ninspector general and the Government Accountability Office criticized \nalmost every aspect of how EPA drafted this rule. Unfortunately, their \nrecommendations to improve it were also ignored. So were more than \n680,000 public comments--a record for any EPA rule. So were the \ncomments of many state environment departments, attorneys general, \ndoctors, educators, sportsmen groups and EPA's own advisory committees. \nAnd, although it should not come as a surprise after 4 years working \nwith this administration, the comments of 45 Senate and 184 House \nmembers were also ignored.\n  Many of us in the Senate have spent the past 2 years--working with 3 \ndifferent administrators--trying to make the administration follow the \nClean Air Act and produce a rule that puts the public's health over the \nprofits of special interests. A rule that heeds the science and \nencourages available technologies to solve this problem. They failed on \nall fronts, big time.\n  Instead they produced a rule that will do nothing for at least a \ndecade, despite years of analysis by EPA showing the need for quick \naction. According to EPA's own regulatory impact analysis, we will be \nlucky if 1 percent of power plant capacity will have mercury controls \nby 2015, and only 3 percent by 2020.\n\n[[Page S7641]]\n\n  As a Vermonter I know it is ``appropriate and necessary'' to limit \nthe pollution plumes from grandfathered power plants. You cannot even \nsee my state on EPA's maps showing mercury pollution because so much of \nit is being dumped on us from upwind power plants. Vermonters and New \nEnglanders have been waiting for decades for EPA to take action so that \nour lakes can be cleaned up.\n  For all their talk of family values, the administration has yet again \nput the value of corporate contributions--not families--first. It is \nnot a family value to tell a whole generation of women that their \nhealth is not important. It is not a family value to put another \ngeneration of young kids at risk of learning disabilities. These \nmercury rules do just that.\n  It is time to put people first, and to stop letting the big polluters \nand the special interests write the rules and run the show over at EPA.\n  This resolution will ensure that the health and safety of U.S. \ncitizens are fully considered, before EPA rescinds its commitment to \nprotect public health from the dangers of mercury pollution. To leave \nmercury pollution from power plants as the only source of toxic air \npollution that is allowed to avoid rigorous emissions standards under \nthe Clean Air Act is a risk to the public's health that we need not, \nand should not, accept.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/29/senate-section/article/S7641-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7641-S7642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESULTION 184--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING \n  MANIFESTATIONS OF ANTI-SEMITISM BY UNITED NATIONS MEMBER STATES AND \nURGING ACTION AGAINST ANTI-SEMITISM BY UNITED NATIONS OFFICIALS, UNITED \nNATIONS MEMBER STATES, AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES, AND FOR \n                             OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM (for himself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Smith, Ms. Collins, Mr. \nColeman, and Mr. Voinovich) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations\n\n                              S. Res. 184\n\n       Whereas the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human \n     Rights recognizes that ``the inherent dignity and equal and \n     inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the \n     foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world'';\n       Whereas United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379 \n     (1975) concluded that ``Zionism is a form of racism and \n     racial discrimination'' and the General Assembly, by a vote \n     of 111 to 25, only revoked Resolution 3379 in 1991 in \n     response to strong leadership by the United States and after \n     Israel made its participation in the Madrid Peace Conference \n     conditional upon repeal of the resolution;\n       Whereas during the 1991 session of the United Nations \n     Commission on Human Rights, the Syrian Ambassador to the \n     United Nations repeated the outrageous ``blood libel'' that \n     Jews allegedly have killed non-Jewish children to make \n     unleavened bread for Passover and, despite repeated \n     interventions by the Governments of Israel and the United \n     States, this outrageous lie was not corrected in the record \n     of the Commission for many months;\n       Whereas in March 1997, the Palestinian observer at the \n     United Nations Commission on Human Rights made the \n     contemptible charge that the Government of Israel had \n     injected 300 Palestinian children with HIV (the human \n     immunodeficiency virus, the pathogen that causes AIDS) \n     despite the fact that an Egyptian newspaper had printed a \n     full retraction to its earlier report of the same charges, \n     and the President of the Commission failed to challenge this \n     baseless and false accusation despite the request of the \n     Government of Israel that he do so;\n       Whereas Israel was denied membership in any regional \n     grouping of the United Nations until the year 2000, which \n     prevented it from being a candidate for any elected positions \n     within the United Nations system until that time, and Israel \n     continues to be denied the opportunity to hold a rotating \n     seat on the Security Council and it is the only member of the \n     United Nations never to have served on the Security Council \n     although it has been a member of the organization for 56 \n     years;\n       Whereas Israel continues to be denied the opportunity to \n     serve as a member of the United Nations Commission on Human \n     Rights because it has never been included in a slate of \n     candidates submitted by a regional grouping, and Israel is \n     currently the only member of the Western and Others Group in \n     a conditional status limiting its ability to caucus with its \n     fellow members of this regional grouping;\n       Whereas the United Nations has permitted itself to be used \n     as a battleground for political warfare against Israel led by \n     Arab states and others, and 6 of the 10 emergency sessions of \n     the United Nations General Assembly have been devoted to \n     criticisms of and attacks against Israel;\n       Whereas the goals of the 2001 United Nations World \n     Conference Against Racism were undermined by hateful anti-\n     Jewish rhetoric and anti-Israel political agendas, prompting \n     both Israel and the United States to withdraw their \n     delegations from the Conference;\n       Whereas in 2004, the United Nations Secretary General \n     acknowledged at the first United Nations-sponsored conference \n     on anti-Semitism, that: ``It is clear that we are witnessing \n     an alarming resurgence of this phenomenon in new forms and \n     manifestations. This time, the world must not--cannot--be \n     silent.'';\n       Whereas in 2004, the United Nations General Assembly's \n     Third Committee for the first time adopted a resolution on \n     religious tolerance that includes condemnation of anti-\n     Semitism and ``recognized with deep concern the overall rise \n     in instances of intolerance and violence directed against \n     members of many religious communities . . . including . . . \n     anti-Semitism . . . '';\n       Whereas in 2005, the United Nations held an unprecedented \n     session to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the liberation \n     of the Auschwitz concentration camp;\n       Whereas democratic Israel is annually the object of nearly \n     two dozen redundantly critical resolutions in the United \n     Nations General Assembly, which rarely adopts resolutions \n     relating to specific countries; and\n       Whereas the viciousness with which Israel is attacked and \n     discriminated against at the United Nations should not be \n     allowed to continue unchallenged: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate--\n       (A) welcomes recent attempts by the United Nations \n     Secretary General to address the issue of anti-Semitism;\n       (B) calls on the United Nations to officially and publicly \n     condemn anti-Semitic statements made at all United Nations \n     meetings and hold accountable United Nations member states \n     that make such statements; and\n       (C) strongly urges the United Nations Educational, \n     Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to develop and \n     implement education awareness programs about the Holocaust \n     throughout the world as part of an effort to combat the rise \n     in anti-Semitism and racial, religious, and ethnic \n     intolerance; and\n       (2) it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (A) the President should direct the United States Permanent \n     Representative to the United Nations to continue working \n     toward further reduction of anti-Semitic language and anti-\n     Israel resolutions;\n       (B) the President should direct the Secretary of State to \n     include in the Department of State's annual Country Reports \n     on Human Rights Practices and annual Report on International \n     Religious Freedom information on activities at the United \n     Nations and its constituent bodies relating to anti-Semitism \n     by each of the countries included in these reports; and\n       (C) the President should direct the Secretary of State to \n     use projects funded through the Middle East Partnership \n     Initiative and United States overseas broadcasts to educate \n     Arab and Muslim countries about anti-Semitism, religious \n     intolerance, and incitement to violence.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution to \nexpress the sense of the Senate regarding manifestations of anti-\nSemitism by United Nations member states and to urge action against \nanti-Semitism by United Nations officials, United Nations member \nstates, and the U.S. government. I am very pleased to be joined in this \neffort by Senators Feingold, Smith, Collins, Coleman, and Voinovich, \nwho are original cosponsors of this legislation.\n  The past several years have revealed an upsurge in anti-Semitic \nviolence around the world. We have seen incidences of it in Europe, the \nMiddle East, and, unfortunately, even at the United Nations. While the \nUnited Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognizes that \n``the inherent dignity and equal and inalienable rights of all members \nof the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in \nthe world,'' there are numerous examples of anti-Semitism and anti-\nIsrael actions at the U.N. and by member states.\n  Allow me to list some examples of anti-Semitic and anti-Israel bias \nthat have been included in the resolution. Clearly false accusations \nhave been made against the Jewish people and the government of Israel \nat the U.N. Commission on Human Rights. These lies were not corrected \nfor months or, in some cases, ever. Israel also continues to be denied \nthe opportunity to hold a rotating seat on the Security Council, \ndespite the fact that it has been a member of the organization for 56 \nyears. It is the only member of the U.N. to be denied this seat. It \ncontinues to be denied the opportunity to\n\n[[Page S7642]]\n\nserve as a member of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights. The goals of \nthe 2001 U.N. World Conference Against Racism were undermined by anti-\nJewish rhetoric and anti-Israel agendas, which led to both the U.S. and \nIsrael withdrawing their delegations from the conference.\n  The resolution being submitted today delineates these examples of \nanti-Semitism, but it also welcomes the steps the U.N. has recently \ntaken to address this problem and urges additional steps to be taken. \nIn 2004, the U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan acknowledged at the \nfirst U.N.-sponsored conference on anti-Semitism that, ``It is clear \nthat we are witnessing an alarming resurgence of this phenomenon in new \nforms and manifestations. This time the world must not--cannot--be \nsilent.'' In 2004, a committee of the U.N. also adopted a resolution \nthat condemned anti-Semitism and recognized the rise in incidences of \nintolerance and violence. Upon the 60th anniversary of the liberation \nof the Auschwitz concentration camps in 2005, the U.N. held an \nunprecedented session to commemorate the occasion.\n  However, the United Nations and its member states must go further in \ncombating this menace. The resolution makes it clear that the United \nStates Senate is committed to opposing anti-Semitism and calls on the \nU.N. to officially and publicly condemn anti-Semitic statements made at \nits meetings and to hold accountable member states that make such \nstatements. The resolution urges educational awareness programs about \nthe Holocaust to be implemented around the world to combat anti-\nSemitism, racism, and religious and ethnic intolerance. The U.S. \nAmbassador to the U.N. should also continue working to reduce anti-\nSemitic and anti-Israel language and resolutions.\n  Likewise, the resolution asks for action from the State Department. \nThe U.S. State Department should include information on anti-Semitic \nactivities at the U.N. and by member states in its annual human rights \nand religious freedom reports. These reports have been very useful in \nproviding important information on the status of human rights and \nreligious freedom around the world, and data on anti-Semitic activities \nfalls clearly within the purpose of these reports. Lastly, the State \nDepartment should use projects funded through the Middle East \nPartnership Initiative and U.S. overseas broadcasts to educate Arab and \nMuslim countries about anti-Semitism, religious intolerance, and \nincitement to violence.\n  A similar resolution to this, introduced by Representatives Ileana \nRos-Lehtinen and Tom Lantos, passed the House of Representatives \nearlier this month by a vote of 409 to 2. I am hopeful that the Senate \nwill similarly pass this resolution. It is time for the Senate to speak \nonce more against the scourge of anti-Israel and anti-Semitic language \nand activity. This resolution will send a message to the United Nations \nand its member countries that we will require it to fight anti-\nSemitism. For this reason, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting \nthese efforts by cosponsoring this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/29/senate-section/article/S7642-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1068.
