Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 119, submitted today.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the resolution by \ntitle.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 119) designating April 21, 2005, as \n     ``National Kindergarten Recognition Day.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the resolution \nthat nationally recognizes the critical role the kindergarten year \nplays in the lives of our Nation's children. This resolution designates \nApril 21, 2005 as National Kindergarten Recognition Day.\n  I have chosen this day because exactly 168 years ago the first \nkindergarten classroom was opened. In 1837, many believed that young \nchildren did not have the ability to focus or to develop cognitive and \nemotional skills. However, Fredrich Froebel, a German school teacher \nand private tutor, held a different opinion and opened the first \nkindergarten classroom with the goal of shaping young children in a \nnurturing, educational, and protected environment.\n  Since then, Mr. Froebel's idea has been confirmed time and again by \nresearch--early years are learning years and kindergarten has a long \nhistory of enhancing children's cognitive, physical, and social \ndevelopment.\n  In the United States, kindergarten was first introduced to American \ncommunities in 1856. Now, close to four million children participate in \nkindergarten programs throughout the country. With attention now \nfocused on increasing access to high-quality child care and pre-school \nprograms, kindergarten is frequently overlooked.\n  While I support both of these laudable goals, I believe we cannot \nignore the impact of the kindergarten year on the development of our \nNation's children. And as policy makers, we must ensure that the \nkindergarten programs are using developmentally, culturally, and \nlinguistically appropriate curricula and have teachers who have \nspecialized knowledge and skills to address their unique needs.\n  On a personal note, I fondly remember my kindergarten year with my \nteacher, Mrs. Espinoza, who encouraged my curiosity and creativity. As \na parent, I recall taking my daughters to their first day of \nkindergarten--they came home excited to tell my wife and me what they \nlearned and to showcase their art and science projects in our home. \nKindergarten prepared my girls for their later school success and \ncultivated their life-long love of learning. I will be just as proud to \nsee my daughter Melinda graduate from high school next month as I was \nthe day of her first school graduation, her kindergarten graduation.\n  It is a pleasure to introduce this resolution that honors \nkindergarten. It is my hope that we can use this day now, and in the \nfuture, to call attention to\n\n[[Page S4160]]\n\nkindergarten and to discuss ways in which we can improve kindergarten \nclassrooms throughout the Nation.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the resolution and \npreamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid on the \ntable, and any statements be printed in the Record, without intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 119) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 119\n\n       Whereas Friedrich Froebel, known as the ``Father of \n     Kindergarten'', opened the first kindergarten classroom on \n     April 21, 1837, with the goal of shaping young children in a \n     nurturing, educational, and protected environment;\n       Whereas kindergarten has a long history of enhancing \n     children's cognitive, physical, and social development in the \n     United States and throughout the world;\n       Whereas Margarethe Meyer Schurz opened the first German-\n     speaking kindergarten in the United States in 1856, Elizabeth \n     Peabody opened the first English-speaking kindergarten in \n     Boston, Massachusetts, in 1873, and the first public school \n     kindergarten classrooms were established under the leadership \n     of Susan Blow and William Torrey Harris in St. Louis, \n     Missouri, in the early 1870s;\n       Whereas kindergarten is a critical year in children's \n     formal education, as well as in their continued physical, \n     social, and emotional development, that prepares them for \n     later school success and lifelong learning;\n       Whereas quality kindergarten programs use developmentally, \n     culturally, and linguistically appropriate curricula, \n     teaching practices, and assessments to support each child's \n     learning and development progress to reach his or her maximum \n     potential;\n       Whereas teachers who teach kindergarten need to have \n     specialized knowledge and skills in working with young \n     children to respond to the unique interests, learning styles, \n     and developmental characteristics of children in their \n     kindergarten year;\n       Whereas kindergarten programs need to be ready for all \n     children who are eligible, including children with \n     disabilities and children who are not native English \n     speakers, and their families;\n       Whereas kindergarten programs should collaborate and \n     coordinate with preschools and with the other early \n     elementary grades in order to provide a continuum of \n     appropriate, effective early learning for all children as \n     they transition to and through the early grades of school;\n       Whereas in 2001, more than more 3,700,000 children between \n     the ages of 4 and 6 years old attended kindergarten, \n     including full-day, half-day, or alternate day programs;\n       Whereas the percentage of children attending full-day \n     kindergarten programs has grown from 28 percent in 1977 to 60 \n     percent in 2001; and\n       Whereas establishment of a ``National Kindergarten \n     Recognition Day'' will help draw attention to the critical \n     role kindergarten plays as the transitional year from early \n     education programs to the elementary and secondary education \n     system: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 21, 2005, as ``National Kindergarten \n     Recognition Day'' to raise public awareness about the impact \n     of the kindergarten year on the development of our nation's \n     children; and\n       (2) urges the people of the United States to recognize the \n     historic tradition of kindergarten in the United States and \n     its contribution to preparing children for their elementary \n     and secondary educational achievement and experiences.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/25/senate-section/article/S4160-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4160-S4162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS WEEK\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 120, which was submitted today.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the resolution by \ntitle.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 120) honoring small businesses during \n     the Small Business Administration's National Small Business \n     Week, the week beginning April 24, 2005.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a Senate \nresolution that honors our Nation's 25 million small businesses and the \ntremendous contributions they make to our economy, as we celebrate the \nSmall Business Administration's--SBA--National Small Business Week \nwhich runs April 24 through April 30, 2005.\n  Small businesses form a solid economic foundation for growth and job \ncreation. The success of our Nation's small businesses have helped \ncreate nearly three-quarters of all new jobs and produce 50 percent of \nour country's gross domestic product.\n  Since becoming Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I have made it one of my top priorities to be a \nmegaphone for small businesses and help raise the needs and concerns of \nour countries' job creators in the Senate. Each year, there are 3 to 4 \nmillion new business startups--and one in 25 adult Americans take the \nsteps to start a business. With one quarter of existing small business \nowners intending to form another business, this is clearly a sector \nthat deserves our accolades and recognition.\n  And of course, one of our most valuable assets for ensuring the \nsuccess of small businesses is the Small Business Administration. This \nagency is pivotal in overseeing the delivery of financial and business \ndevelopment tools for millions of aspiring entrepreneurs and existing \nsmall businesses across the United States. And since 1999, the SBA's \nprograms have helped created and retain over 4.5 million jobs.\n  Particularly, the SBA's financing programs have been a crucial source \nto accessing capital for small businesses, and have never been more in \ndemand with both the 7(a) program and 504 program delivering measurable \nresults. The numbers from fiscal year 2004 represent these programs \nindisputable success, with the 7(a) program providing over $13.5 \nbillion in loans to help small businesses create 132,603 new jobs. The \n504 program lent $4 billion to support the creation of 86,847 jobs.\n  Furthermore, the SBA's entrepreneurial development programs assisted \nalmost 1.5 million startup and existing small businesses. In fact, the \nSmall Business Development Center--SBDC--program served over 725,000 \nclients and helped create or retain over 168,000 jobs in fiscal year \n2003, while the SBA's Women's Business Center's training and counseling \nhelped to create or retain over 6,500 jobs in fiscal year 2003.\n  We have also provided small businesses with tax relief to help grow \ntheir business. For example, I championed an increase in the amount a \nsmall business can deduct when they invest in equipment and other \nbusiness assets capital that fuels expansion and job creation.\n  So as we celebrate our Nation's small businesses, we must be mindful \nof Congress's responsibility to ensure that each business has the \nopportunity to flourish. With the BA's budget drastically declining by \n36 percent over the last 5 years, I will not hesitate to take action \nand ensure that this vital sector continues to have the valuable \nresources they deserve.\n  The SBA has been a critical partner to millions of small enterprises \nas well as aspiring entrepreneurs as they embark on the path to \nprosperity and job creation. The least we can do is strengthen, not \nerode, the SBA's core loan and technical assistance programs that have \nproven time and again to be the keystone in aiding the efforts and \ndreams of America's entrepreneurs.\n  Today we celebrate our Nation's entrepreneurs and honor America's \nsmall businesses. I urge my colleagues to show their support for the \nsmall businesses in their States and support this resolution. We must \nremember that the investment and support that we provide to our small \nbusiness today is integral to our Nation's economic and job security \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor America's single \ngreatest economic resource: our small businesses. Small businesses \ndrive our economy, making up 99 percent of all firms, and today marks \nthe first day of the annual National Small Business Week celebration. \nThis week, we honor the firms that are working year round to provide \ngoods and services to us all. Every day, small businesses and \nentrepreneurs are making innovations, creating new jobs, and pushing \nour economy forward. In fact, more than 50 percent of our Nation's GDP \nand more than two-thirds of all new jobs in our economy are \nattributable to small businesses. From the high-tech startup and the \nsmall manufacturer to the family-owned bookstore and the lemonade stand \nrun by the little girl down the street, small businesses and \nentrepreneurs are an exciting part of our communities. And the \nopportunities they create represent the American Dream.\n\n[[Page S4161]]\n\n  Given the importance of small businesses to our economy, it is only \nlogical that there would be a Federal agency dedicated to promoting and \nprotecting their interests. The Small Business Administration, which I \nam sure my colleagues are well aware of, serves as an indispensable \nsmall business advocate and resource within the Federal Government. \nWith offices and strategic resource partners across the country, the \nSBA is able to serve entrepreneurs at the local level by providing \ntraining, mentorship, and valuable resources and at the national level \nby encouraging agencies to extend contracts to small businesses and to \ndevelop small-business friendly regulations.\n  The SBA offers a number of programs designed to help small businesses \novercome obstacles to success. I am proud to support these programs, \nwhich tackle issues ranging from entrepreneurial development and access \nto capital to Federal contracting and trade assistance.\n  Without these SBA resources, thousands of small businesses would not \nhave grown, survived tough times, or even been created. Once small \nbusinesses such as Staples, Intel, Nike, America Online, Black \nEnterprise Magazine, Eskimo Joe's, Callaway Golf, FedEx, Hewlett-\nPackard, Jenny Craig, Gymboree, Ben & Jerry's, Winnebago, Sun \nMicrosystems, and Outback Steakhouse all received assistance through at \nleast one of the SBA's programs. These businesses started out small but \nare now household names. They prove that their owners had excellent \nbusiness ideas even though traditional lenders or venture capitalists \nwould not take a chance on them. The SBA gave these once small \nbusinesses an opportunity to grow, helping them to get their foot in \nthe door and eventually bring new products to markets across the \ncountry and the world. The long-term gains that our economy experiences \nfrom helping these companies are too numerous to list entirely, but \nthey include thousands of jobs, a stronger economy, increased \nopportunities and millions in additional tax revenue, which has paid \nfor the SBA's budget many times over.\n  While helping them grow is a part of SBA's mission, many small \nbusinesses are not looking to become large corporations, and these too \nneed SBA's assistance and support. Every small business is important. \nOur neighborhoods could not function and would not be the same without \nthe local dry cleaner, the corner market, the day care provider, the \nhardware store, the car mechanic, the restaurant, and countless other \nsmall businesses. Whether family-owned or a franchise, an S Corp or a \nsole-proprietor, fast-growing or home-based, all small businesses \ncontribute greatly to our economy. And for decades, the SBA has been \nthere to help.\n  According to SBA Administrator Hector Barreto's recent testimony \nbefore the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, the \nSBA backed a record $21.3 billion in loans and related financing to \nsmall businesses last year. Of that money, nearly one-third of it went \nto businesses owned by women or minorities. The SBA's major technical \nassistance programs reached a record number of clients last year, and \nthe procurement assistance programs aided more than 37,000 small \nbusinesses. These impressive figures demonstrate that the \nentrepreneurial sector of our economy is alive and flourishing, in part \nbecause of the SBA. It is up to us, in the Federal Government, to \nensure that this entrepreneurial spirit continues to thrive.\n  This week, in honor of National Small Business Week, the SBA is \nhosting SBA Expo '05, which serves to highlight the year's greatest \nachievers and small business advocates. I am proud to join Senator \nSnowe and several other members of Congress as an honorary cochair of \nthis event, where the SBA will also honor the National Small Business \nPerson of the Year and State winners, including Massachusetts' own Fred \nCurtis, Jr. of Curtis Tractor Cab. Mr. Curtis has worked tirelessly to \nexpand his company, growing from 21 employees in 1988 to 221 employees \nlast year. Demonstrating the value that a small investment can give, \nCurtis Tractor Cab has grown more than 700 percent since receiving an \nSBA 504 loan from the Worcester Business Development Corp. I thank Mr. \nCurtis for his important contributions to the Worcester area. I know I \nspeak for the small business community in Massachusetts when I say we \nare very proud to have an entrepreneur like Mr. Curtis representing our \nState with this award.\n  I also commend all of the SBA award winners this week. Their \ncontributions to their States, communities, and our national economy \nare immense. In addition, I specifically congratulate Steven Stultz, \nthe National 2005 Financial Services Champion of the Year. Much of what \nthe SBA does involves access to capital, and Mr. Stultz has been a \nubiquitous leader for the greater lending community. He is an active \nmember of the National Association of Development Companies--NADCO--\nsits on the Board of Directors for CDC Small Business Finance, and is \nin his second year of a 3-year term as chairman of the National \nAssociation of Government Guaranteed Lenders--NAGGL. Mr. Stultz's \ndedication and leadership have propelled the 7(a) and 504 loan programs \ninto powerful economic development tools. He has worked closely with \nCongress, particularly with the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, to make necessary and thoughtful changes to the SBA's \nseveral loan program. I am thankful and supportive of his tireless \nadvocacy and work to make access to capital easier for small businesses \nnationwide.\n  As a tribute to the SBA and the 25 million small businesses in the \nNation, Senator Olympia J. Snowe and I support S. Res 120, to honor \ntheir impact on our Nation and our economy. As the resolution \nindicates, the SBA has assisted more than 20 million entrepreneurs \nthroughout its history. However, despite the agency's noble mission, \nits assistance to small businesses is being threatened by this \nadministration, which has cut funding to the SBA by 36 percent since \n2001--more than any other Federal agency. One can only imagine how much \nmore the SBA could have done for small businesses this year with just \nthe same funding it received in 2001. We may never know the true cost \nthese cuts have had on the future growth of our economy. How many \nIntels were passed up for funding, how many rural businesses weren't \nable to get management assistance, and how many jobs weren't created?\n  Small businesses give entrepreneurs the opportunity to pursue their \npassion, they give parents the opportunity to stay at home with kids \nwhile supplementing the household income, they give people the \nopportunity to be their own bosses, they empower women and minorities, \nand they spark innovation. Small businesses are vital to the success of \nour country and our economy, and we must do everything in our power to \nensure our small businesses and entrepreneurs have the greatest \nresources in the world.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid on the \ntable.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 120) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 120\n\n       Whereas America's 25,000,000 small businesses have fueled \n     the Nation's economy, creating more than \\3/4\\ of all new \n     jobs and accounting for more than 50 percent of the Nation's \n     gross domestic product;\n       Whereas small businesses are the Nation's innovators, \n     advancing technology and fueling the economic growth and \n     productivity;\n       Whereas the Small Business Administration has been a \n     critical partner in the success of the Nation's small \n     businesses and these businesses' continued economic growth;\n       Whereas the mission of the Small Business Administration is \n     to maintain and strengthen the Nation's economy by aiding, \n     counseling, assisting, and protecting the interests of small \n     businesses and by helping families and small businesses \n     recover from natural disasters;\n       Whereas the Small Business Administration has helped small \n     businesses access critical lending opportunities, protected \n     small businesses from excessive Federal regulatory \n     enforcement, played a key role in ensuring full and open \n     competition for government contracts, and improved the \n     economic environment in which small businesses compete;\n       Whereas the Small Business Administration, which was \n     established in 1953, has also provided valuable service to \n     small businesses through financial assistance, technical \n     assistance, procurement assistance, small business advocacy, \n     and disaster recovery assistance;\n\n[[Page S4162]]\n\n       Whereas for over 50 years the Small Business Administration \n     has helped approximately 22,000,000 Americans start, grow, \n     and expand their businesses and has placed almost \n     $250,000,000,000 in loans and venture capital financing into \n     the hands of entrepreneurs;\n       Whereas the Small Business Administration has helped \n     millions of entrepreneurs achieve the American dream of \n     owning a small business; and\n       Whereas the Small Business Administration will mark \n     National Small Business Week, the week beginning April 24, \n     2005: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors small businesses during the Small Business \n     Administration's National Small Business Week, the week \n     beginning April 24, 2005;\n       (2) supports the purpose and goals of National Small \n     Business Week; and\n       (3) commends the Small Business Administration and the \n     Small Business Administration's resource partners--\n       (A) for their work, which has been critical in helping the \n     Nation's small businesses grow and develop; and\n       (B) for being key players in the Nation's economic \n     vitality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/25/senate-section/article/S4162-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CORRECTING THE ANABOLIC STEROID CONTROL ACT\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed on H.R. 3, which the \nclerk will report:\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to the consideration of a bill (H.R. 3) \n     to authorize funds for Federal-aid highways, highway safety \n     programs, and transit programs, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, on Friday, the leader filed a cloture \nmotion on the motion to proceed to H.R. 3, the highway bill. I believe \nthe cloture vote has been scheduled for tomorrow at 11:45 am. I \nstrongly urge all of my colleagues to vote yes.\n  The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, TEA-21, expired \non September 30, 2003, nearly 19 months ago. Yet we are still \nattempting to get a bill done. The Federal-aid program has been \noperating under a number of short-term extensions--a total of six to \ndate.\n  We need to get this done. The vote on Tuesday on cloture is critical. \nIf we cannot proceed to this bill, we will miss yet another deadline \nand our States will continue to pay the price. The current May 31 \nexpiration date for the highway, transit and safety programs is fast \napproaching. The House bill, H.R. 3, has some very significant \ndifferences from S. 732 the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient \nTransportation Equity Act of 2005, SAFETEA, the bill reported out by \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee on March 16. We will need as \nmuch time as possible to work out a compromise. Although we may not all \nbe in perfect agreement here on the Senate floor on each and every \nprovision of S. 732, one thing I believe we are all in agreement on is \nthat we need to get this done. In addition to conversations with \ncolleagues, I have visited with community leaders and outside interest \ngroups and the message is clear . . . get the bill done.\n  My committee colleagues and I are asking the Senate to consider \nessentially the same language that 76 Senators voted for in 108th \nCongress. The Environment and Public Works Committee used as its mark \nthe Senate-passed S. 1072 with the exception that we adjusted the \nnumbers to reflect the President's proposed spending level of $284 \nbillion over 6 years. During our markup we accepted several non-\ncontroversial amendments from committee members. None of these \namendments substantially changed the policy goals of the bill as passed \nlast year.\n  Therefore, I strongly urge my colleagues to support the pending \ncloture motion and allow us to move to H.R. 3. We really need to keep \nthis moving. The longer we delay enactment of a long-term bill, we are \nnegatively effecting economic growth. According to DOT estimates, every \n$1 billion of Federal funds invested in highway improvements creates \n47,000 jobs. The same $1 billion investment yields $500 million in new \norders for the manufacturing sector and $500 million spread throughout \nother sectors of the economy.\n  State contract awards for the 2005 spring and summer construction \nseason are going out to bid. If we fail to send a bill to the President \nby May 31st, States will not know what to expect in Federal funding and \nthe uncertainty will potentially force States to delay putting these \nprojects out for bid. According to the American Association of State \nHighway Transportation Officials--AASHTO, an estimated 90,000 jobs are \nat stake. This problem is exacerbated for northern States, such as \nAlaska, that have shorter construction seasons. Many State \ntransportation departments have advanced State dollars to construct \nprojects eligible for Federal-funding in anticipation of our action to \nreauthorize the program. Without a new bill, States are essentially \nleft ``holding the bag.''\n  Over the past 6 years under TEA-21, we have made great progress in \npreserving and improving the overall physical condition and operation \nof our transportation system. However, more needs to be done. A safe, \neffective transportation system is the foundation of our economy. We \nare past due to fulfill an obligation to this country and the American \npeople.\n  I am pleased that the President's budget assumed more funding for \nreauthorization over his previous level of $256 billion. I and along \nwith many of you believe we need more. Certainly that is an issue that \nwill be thoroughly debated on the floor of the Senate, but we can't \neven have that debate unless we get to the floor.\n  Again, if we are able to proceed, the language that the Senate will \nbe considering is essentially the same bill that was passed on the \nSenate floor last year--a bipartisan product of many months of hard \nwork and compromise. This bill remains a very good piece of legislation \nwhich I hope will require few, if any, changes here on the floor. \nHowever, I am anxious to discuss with Senators their amendments so that \nwe can debate them and hopefully get this bill in conference with the \nHouse prior to the recess, but we need to get to the bill first.\n  S. 1072 passed the Senate last year guaranteed all donor States a \nrate of return of 95 percent. I can remember that was 75 percent when I \nfirst came here. At a lower funding level we were able only to achieve \na 92 percent rate of return but kept the 10 percent floor over TEA-21. \nThe scope, or split of percent funding above and below the line, remain \nthe same at 92.5 percent.\n  In order to get this bill off the floor, we have to balance the needs \nof donor and donee States. I will be the first to acknowledge that this \nbalance--as with any compromise--is not perfect. My colleagues \nrepresenting donee and donor States that receive lower rates of return \nor growth rates than they feel fair have made this fact very clear to \nme over the past year.\n  I am very sympathetic to the concerns of both donors and donees in \nthis\n\n[[Page S4163]]\n\nsituation. Both have significant transportation needs that cannot be \nignored. Addressing their concerns has become more difficult in the \nlast year due to the fact that we have less money. Providing either \ngroup with more money would add significantly to the cost of the bill \nor take away from other programs. But holding up even consideration of \nthis bill will not solve the problem. We need to proceed to H.R. 3 so \nthat donor and donee States will have the opportunity to offer their \namendments on how to improve their State's treatment.\n  I am certain my colleagues share my strong desire to get a \ntransportation reauthorization bill passed. We must act to get a bill \nto and through conference prior to the May 31 expiration of the current \nextension. This will be a very difficult challenge, but if we act \nquickly we can do it.\n  Now let's look at the alternative. What will happen if we do not pass \na highway bill? There will not be another extension. If we don't pass \nthe bill there will be no chance of improvement on donor State rate of \nreturn and no new safety core program to help Spates respond to \nthousands of deaths each year on our roadways.\n  Our bill up has many safety provisions, as the ranking Democrat, \nSenator Jeffords knows. We didn't agree on all these, but we finally \nagreed on a final product. Without a bill, there will be no real \nstreamlining of environmental reviews, so critical products would be \nstill subject to avoidable delays. There will be no increased ability \nto use innovative financing, thereby giving States more tools to \nadvance projects.\n  Out in California, they have done some things that are working very \nwell. We have studied these and put some very innovative provisions in \nthis bill to allow us to get more for the dollar than we can get today. \nBut without a bill, we cannot do that.\n  Without a bill, we would not have any Safe Routes to School. This is \na program many of the Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate \nhave embraced. But without a bill, we will not have that.\n  Without a bill, the States will continue to have uncertainty in \nplanning, thereby delaying projects and negatively impacting jobs.\n  It is easy to sit up here in Washington and be indecisive about these \nthings, but the States have to make plans in advance. For each delay, \nthat is less they are going to get.\n  Without a bill, we have no new border program, which is critical to \nborder States dealing with NAFTA.\n  Without a bill, we have delay in the establishment of the national \ncommission to explore how to fund transportation in the future. It is \nsomething we have been doing essentially the same way year in and year \nout, but we are studying new methods now as motor vehicles are more \nfuel efficient and a tax collection system based solely on fuel \nconsumption becomes less practical.\n  Without a bill, we won't have any increased opportunity to address \nchoke points at intermodal connectors.\n  The firewall protection of the highway trust fund would not be \ncontinued, thereby making the trust fund vulnerable to raids in order \nto pay for other programs.\n  It is very important that we move forward. We studied this for a year \nand a half before coming to the Senate a year ago right now. Certainly \nthe ranking Democrat on the committee, Senator Jeffords, can remember \nthe months and months we worked on it. We came to the Senate with a \ngood bill, passed it, went to conference, and were unable to get a vote \non the conference report. Because of that, all these 10 things I \nmentioned did not happen this year. For all these things to happen, to \nmove forward, we have to have a bill. We cannot have a bill until we \nvote on the motion to proceed so that we will be able to move to the \nbill. That is what this is all about.\n  I recognize the ranking Democrat on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, Senator Jeffords.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Frist for the \nopportunity to debate this important legislation.\n  I also thank Senator Reid for his leadership in getting us to where \nwe are today on this bill.\n  In addition, I thank Chairman Inhofe, Senators Bond, and Baucus, as \nwell as other chairmen and ranking members for all of their hard work \nand cooperation on this legislation.\n  A little over a year ago, I stood before my colleagues, in the same \nplace I am standing now, asking for their support of our Nation's \nsurface transportation system.\n  I am hopeful now, as I was then, that we will be able to work in a \nbipartisan fashion to pass this legislation quickly so our states can \nproceed with their critical work.\n  Today we are in a similar situation as we were a year ago.\n  Our bill maintains the important principles that were developed over \nthe years of work in our committees.\n  We continue to grow and support the core programs that are the \nbuilding block of a strong transportation system.\n  We maintain flexibility for States, because they know best how to \nmeet their needs.\n  We also try to increase the funds going out to the States.\n  This bill will enhance safety on our Nation's highways through \neducation, better infrastructure, and enforcement.\n  The increased intermodal flexibility set forth in the bill will allow \nStates, if they wish to improve freight handling and movement.\n  The growth in congestion mitigation and air quality funding will help \nStates improve air quality, reduce pollution and address congestion.\n  The bill makes it easier for States to mitigate project effects on \nhabitat and wetlands, and retains and expands popular programs such as \nenhancements recreational trails and scenic byways.\n  This bill also reduces congestion on our Nation's roadways by \nenhancing public transportation and promoting intermodal solutions to \nregional transportation problems.\n  These are all critical components to a successful bill and I am glad \nthat, through much hard work, we were able to develop strong national \npolicy.\n  It may not be exactly what any one Member would have crafted on his \nor her own, but this is a strong and unified step in the right \ndirection.\n  There are, however, some key differences.\n  A year ago, we presented you with a well-funded bill that struck a \ndelicate balance between the core programs and flexibility on program \nand modal spending at the State and local level.\n  This time our job was made more difficult by fiscal constraints \ninsisted upon by the administration.\n  The White House has suggested an overall funding level for surface \ntransportation of $284 billion over 6 years.\n  This despite the President's own Transportation Department saying we \nneed at least $300 billion to simply maintain the status quo, and \nsomething well above that level to make progress on conditions and \nperformance.\n  Last year the Senate passed a highway bill at $318 billion with 76 \nvotes.\n  It is unfortunate that the President fails to see the value of a \nrobust transportation program.\n  It is unfortunate the President fails to see the jobs that will be \nlost, and the roads and bridges that will go unrepaired and unbuilt.\n  It is unfortunate the President doesn't see the lives that could be \nsaved with better roads and the time that will be wasted sitting in \ntraffic.\n  All of this is the result of inadequate funding.\n  While my colleagues and I have continued to impress upon him the \nvalue of increased funding, we continue to work within the box that the \nadministration has put us in.\n  We tried to meet everyone's needs while not neglecting our \nresponsibilities to the highway trust fund.\n  This is a very difficult task given the restrictions this \nadministration has imposed on us.\n  But we did what was asked of us.\n  All of the committees have acted and passed a bill at $284 billion.\n  Make no mistake--we have made sacrifices that none of us wanted.\n  I am hopeful we will increase the funding in this bill as we move it \nthrough the Senate in the coming days.\n  That said, I stand here before you with the structure of a bill that \nhas the potential to move our transportation system forward--not the \ngiant leap we had hoped to make but meager steps that I hope will be \nthe first of many in helping us get where we need to go.\n\n[[Page S4164]]\n\n  Mr. President, I need not remind you that the authorization for this \nprogram expired 19 months ago.\n  In that time, there have been nearly 70,000 traffic fatalities with \nan economic cost of over $370 billion.\n  Americans continue to sit in traffic for close to 50 hours a year, 10 \nminutes more per hour traveled than when the last reauthorization bill \nwas passed.\n  Mr. President, 18 percent of our roads are in poor or mediocre \ncondition; 29 percent of bridges are deficient or functionally \nobsolete; over a quarter of our transit facilities are in below average \ncondition; more than 3 million jobs are waiting to be created.\n  While we neglect to act, transportation in this country continues to \ndegrade.\n  Things are getting worse, not better.\n  We have lost one construction season and are on our way to missing \nanother.\n  In northern States such as Vermont, this is not a little problem. It \nis a big one.\n  We must act on this legislation now.\n  We must pass a nationwide surface transportation reauthorization bill \nthis year.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to debate H.R. 3 on the \nSenate floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I say to my good friend, Senator Jeffords, \nwe are not political equals in philosophy; yet I, as a conservative, \nagree with everything the Senator has said in terms of the need for \nroads and the need for infrastructure.\n  Senator Jeffords talked about some of the deficiencies we have, but I \nhave to say in my State of Oklahoma the FAWA goes out and they rate \nroads and bridges. Oklahoma is dead last in bridges. This is a life-\nand-death situation. We lose lives every year.\n  A lot of my friends say: Well, you did not want to have a robust, \nexpensive highway bill. I say to them: That is what we are supposed to \nbe doing here.\n  I am a conservative. There is no one more conservative, according to \nthe ACLU, than I am in this Senate. Yet I can say we need to spend \nmoney on infrastructure in the United States.\n  I will say a little bit about the formula of which I have been very \nproud. Both my good friend from Vermont and I used to serve in the \nother body before we came to the Senate. At that time, I was on the \nTransportation Committee in the House. I watched the way we did things \nthere and how we do things here. I don't want to be critical of the way \nthe other body operates, but we do it in a more fair and equitable way.\n  It would be easy--if we needed 60 Senators, we could give them \nprojects until everyone signed on, and then forget about the other 40, \nhave a vote, and go home. That could happen, but we did not do that. We \nhave a complicated formula.\n  This creates different anxieties in different States where there is \nopposition because in one particular area they do not do as well as \nanother State. Let me give an example of how complicated the formula \nis.\n  In a formula, you take into consideration an abundance of items, such \nas interstate lane miles. This is something in the formulas we take \ninto consideration. Obviously, there is a reason. Or vehicle miles \ntraveled, which is referred to as VMT. Over the next few days we will \nhear that quite often. The vehicle miles traveled on interstate has to \nbe something to consider in terms of authorizing a 6-year program.\n  The contributions to the highway trust fund are very significant. We \nhear from some of the large States that they give more to the highway \ntrust fund. I suggest it is not just people in that State who are \nmaking those contributions; people driving through the State also have \nto buy fuel in those States.\n  The lane miles on principal arteries, excluding the intersection, is \nweighted in the formula to a percentage. The VMT on principal arteries \nis considered. Diesel fuel used on highways is a consideration. Total \nlane miles on principal arteries divided by population is considered \nwhen we look at a formula that would affect all 50 States. So total \nlane miles on Federal aid highways, total vehicle miles traveled on \nFederal aid highways, the contributions to the highway trust fund, or \nthe highway account, attributable to highway users, the cost to repair \nor replace deficient highways and bridges have to be considered. In the \nState of Alaska, for example, the Presiding Officer's State, it is more \nexpensive. They have severe winters in Alaska. We do not have severe \nwinters in some of the Southern States. This has to be part of the \nconsideration.\n  The weighted nonattainment and maintenance area, population, the \nequal shares to each eligible State on highways, recreational trails \nprogram, the border planning, borders and corridors--this is \nsignificant to States such as California and Arizona, Texas, Florida, \nand, of course, the northern tier of States. The border States' share \nof cargo weight, what their share is of cargo value, the number of \ncommercial vehicles entering the border State, the number of passenger \nvehicles entering the border State--all these are part of the formula.\n  We have low-income States. My State of Oklahoma is a low-income \nState. The State of Arizona is a high-income State. That is a \nconsideration. One of the chief workers on the bill has been Senator \nBaucus from Montana. He is the ranking member on the committee; Kit \nBond chairs that subcommittee on transportation within our committee. \nHe has a low-population State. Obviously, if you have a low-population \nState, that has to be a consideration. There still have to be roads so \nthey can travel and other people can travel through their States. But \nif they base it all on getting 100 percent back, and they do not have \nextra consideration--that has to be part of the formula.\n  Low-population-density States is a factor. The high fatality rates \nare a factor. The fatality rate in my State of Oklahoma is higher than \naverage. The guaranteed minimum growth of each State--there is a limit \napplied to that--and the guaranteed minimum rate of return for donor \nStates is a consideration. I remember when that guaranteed minimum rate \nof return for donor States was 75 percent, and it only crept up to 80, \n85 and 90; now we operate on 90.5 percent. If we passed the bill \noffered last year, the way it passed in Senate, we would be at 95 \npercent. Every State would be guaranteed 95 percent return of donations \nof that State.\n  If we did not do it this way, we could do it the politically easy \nway--handing out projects until it is done. But that is where pork \ncomes in. That is where most of the criticism comes from. I have heard \na lot of the commentators talk about the highway bill the Senate has is \nfull of projects and pork. My response is they have not read it yet. \nThere are only two projects in the entire bill. Only two. On the other \nside, there are several hundred. It is a totally different approach.\n  So we have these things that are of major consideration. We have to \nget this bill done. The best way to get it done, of course, is to vote \nfavorably tomorrow on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to \nproceed, and then to move on to the bill.\n  Now, we have several people who may wish to speak. I mentioned \nSenator Bond, who is the chairman of the Transportation Subcommittee. \nSenator Baucus, who has been very helpful in working with us, is the \nranking member of the subcommittee. There is Senator Jeffords and \nmyself. Of course, we have 18 members of our committee. We would like \nto invite them to come down right now. I will defer to anyone who wants \nto come down and talk about this legislation. In the event that nobody \nshows up, I have more to say. I think, probably, the Senator from \nVermont might have more to say, too.\n  So at the present time I will go ahead and suggest the absence of a \nquorum and encourage members of our committee and others who want to be \nheard on the highway bill to come down and speak.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized to speak for up to 30 minutes as\n\n[[Page S4165]]\n\nin morning business. However, I want to say if anyone comes down to \nspeak on the motion to proceed to the highway bill, I will stop at that \npoint so they can be recognized. I will yield to them. However, I want \nmy entire speech to be printed in the Record as if given intact.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Third Pillar of Climate Alarmism\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I will continue my series of the \nfour pillars of climate alarmism. This is the third pillar speech. In \nmy first speech, I outlined how the media and some of the environmental \nextremists distorted, exaggerated, and mischaracterized a major climate \nchange report from the National Academy of Sciences.\n  I showed how the left and the media exaggerated a document that \ncontained numerous caveats about the uncertainties of current knowledge \nand the caution that its conclusions were tentative, proclaiming the \nreport showed conclusively that global warming due to man is occurring.\n  In my second speech, I described some of the more serious and, \nindeed, fatal flaws in the 2001 Third Assessment Report from the U.N.'s \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, known also as the IPCC, \nwhich I will refer to from time to time. In that speech, I exposed how \nMichael Mann's now infamous ``hockey stick,'' the flagship of the \nIPCC's claims that global warming is real, has been thoroughly \ndiscredited in scientific circles, and that the IPCC's projections of \nfuture carbon emissions, which drive temperature model conclusions, \nhave been proven to be based on political decisions that, by the end of \nthe century, countries such as Libya will be as wealthy or wealthier \nthan the United States.\n  Now, I would like to examine the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment \nReport, which received considerable attention on its release late last \nyear. Last November, the Arctic Council, described as a ``high-level \ninformation forum'' that includes the United States, Canada, Denmark, \nFinland, Iceland, Norway, the Russian Federation, and Sweden, released \nits 140-page arctic synthesis report, entitled, ``Impacts of a Warming \nArctic.'' It details the major findings from the Arctic Council's \n1,200-page scientific report, which will be released in the coming \nweeks.\n  The essence of the synthesis report is this: The Arctic is \nexperiencing unprecedented climate change, caused, in large part, if \nnot entirely, by manmade greenhouse gas emissions, while projections \nshow dramatic Arctic warming accompanied by even more pronounced \nchanges that will have serious repercussions for the entire planet.\n  At first blush, the report appears to be quite impressive. It \ncontains glossy photos, charts, and graphs, and was produced by some \n300 scientists from several nations. But it lacks virtually any \nscientific documentation, which casts doubt on the report's page after \npage of unqualified, matter-of-fact claims about Arctic warming. That \ndocumentation, we are told, is forthcoming in the more lengthy \nscientific report. So it is unclear if the 140-page document accurately \nreflects the contents of the scientific report.\n\n  If it does, then the scientific report simply ignores or dismisses \nreams of peer-reviewed scientific work contradicting the Arctic \nCouncil's conclusions. If it does not, then the synthesis report would \nappear to be an exercise in global warming propaganda.\n  The release of the report created a media sensation with nearly every \nmajor news outlet declaring, once again, that the scientific consensus \non global warming had been reaffirmed.\n  Here is the Chicago Tribune's report from November 24, 2004:\n\n       The council's 140-page report, four years in the making, \n     warns of immense ice melts, a dramatic rise in ocean levels, \n     the depletion of the Gulf Stream and other sea currents, wild \n     fluctuations in weather patterns, increased ultraviolet \n     radiation and wrenching dislocations in the food chain and \n     habitat.\n\n  In equally dramatic fashion, the Associated Press described the \nreport this way. It said:\n\n       This most comprehensive study of Arctic warming to date \n     adds yet more impetus to the projections by many of the \n     world's climate scientists that there will be a steady rise \n     in global temperature as the result of greenhouse gases \n     released into the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels \n     and other sources.\n\n  Such descriptions of the report are really not far off the mark, and \nfor good reason. In this case, the media and extremist groups got \nexactly what they wished for--140 pages detailing a daunting list of \nprojected environmental catastrophes: permafrost melting, \ninfrastructure collapsing, glaciers vanishing, sea levels rising, \ncoastal communities flooding, polar bears facing extinction.\n  Worse, the authors left the impression that these scenarios were all \nbut assured, despite the fact that the assumptions on which they are \nbased are highly uncertain--a point I will examine later in this \nspeech. Thus, no spin, distortion, or exaggeration on the media's part \nwas necessary.\n  The synthesis report constructs a deceptive picture of climate \nchanges that have occurred in the Arctic over the last 30 years, \nparticularly with respect to temperature change. A major piece of \nevidence supporting the Arctic Council's alarmist conclusions is the \nArctic's ``unprecedented'' temperature increase over the last several \ndecades. The report's authors make the following statement on page 23. \nI am quoting now. It says:\n\n       Examining the record of past climatic conditions indicates \n     that the amount, speed, and pattern of warming experienced in \n     recent decades are indeed unusual and are characteristic of \n     the human-caused increase in greenhouse gases.\n\n  Specifically, according to the Council, annual average temperature in \nthe Arctic has increased at almost twice the rate of the rest of the \nworld, while winter temperatures in Alaska and western Canada have \nincreased about 3 to 4 degrees Celsius over the past half century, with \nlarger increases projected in the next 100 years.\n  Surely, this is proof of unprecedented, human-induced warming, and of \nworrisome warming trends for the future? Not quite. Let's take a closer \nlook at the peer-reviewed literature on the temperature history of the \nArctic, which the Arctic Council's synthesis report totally ignored.\n  First, in the November 2002 issue of the Journal Holocene, \nresearchers examined proxy temperature data in northern Russia spanning \nover 2,000 years. They found that ``the warmest periods over the last \ntwo millennia in this region were clearly in the third, tenth to \ntwelfth, and during the twentieth centuries.'' The earlier periods, \nthey claim, were warmer than those of the 20th century, while 20th \ncentury temperatures appeared to peak at around 1940.\n  For a much broader perspective on Arctic temperatures, one can read \nthe 2003 paper by researcher Igor Polyakov in the journal EOS, a \npublication of the American Geophysical Union. In the paper titled \n``Trends and Variations in Arctic Climate Systems,'' Polyakov studied \nland and ocean data from northward of latitude 62.5 degrees north, \ndating back to 1870.\n  As is obvious from this chart, one can see that current temperature \nover the entire region is similar to that measured 70 years ago. \nAccording to Polyakov:\n\n       Two distinct warming periods from 1920 to 1945, and from \n     1975 to the present, are clearly evident.\n\n  He goes on to note that ``compared with the global and hemispheric \ntemperature rise, the high-latitude temperature increase was stronger \nin the late 1930s to the early 1940s than in recent decades.''\n  Strangely there is no mention of this in the Arctic report, but \nalarmists don't seem to care. They would probably respond that: 300 \nscientists from all over the world believe such warming is occurring. \nYou, sir, have merely identified two whose research presents a contrary \nview.\n  To answer that charge I will submit for the Record an impressive list \nof scientists from several countries, including the United States, \nwhose peer-reviewed work shows current Arctic temperatures are no \nhigher than temperatures recorded in the 1930s and the 1940s.\n  Let me quote from a few salient examples. In a 2003 issue of the \nJournal of Climate, seven researchers concluded the following:\n\n       In contrast to the global and hemispheric temperature, the \n     maritime Arctic temperature was higher in the late 1930s \n     through the early 1940s than in the 1990s.\n\n\n[[Page S4166]]\n\n\n  Here is another excerpt from the 2000 International Journal of \nClimatology, Dr. Rajmund Przybylak of Nicholas Copernicus University in \nTorun, Poland. It reads:\n\n       The highest temperatures since the beginning of \n     instrumental observation occurred clearly in the 1930s and \n     can be attributed to changes in atmospheric circulation.\n\n  Finally, in 2001, researchers examined a 10,000-year span of sea core \nsediment in the Chukchi Sea and concluded that ``in the recent past, \nthe western Arctic Ocean was much warmer than it is today.'' They also \nfound that ``during the middle Holocene [approximately 6,000 years ago] \nthe August sea surface temperature fluctuated by 5 degrees Celsius and \nwas 3-7 degrees Celsius warmer than it is today.'' Obviously, the \nmiddle Holocene period was not known for SUVs and coal-fired \npowerplants.\n  To get a fuller sense of the report's bias, consider the Arctic \nCouncil's geographical definition of ``the Arctic.'' This is important \nbecause the temperature record differs depending on one's definition. \nThe Arctic report's temperature record includes data from northward of \nlatitude 60 degrees North. Why the Arctic Council chose this point is \nnot explained. In fact, the report's authors responsible for defining \nthe Arctic admitted last November that their choice was arbitrary.\n  The Arctic Council's starting point is problematic for two reasons. \nFirst, Dr. George Taylor, Oregon's State climatologist and a past \npresident of the American Association of State Climatologists, recently \nexamined Arctic temperature trends using different starting points. As \nDr. Taylor found, ``[u]sing 60 degrees North introduced a lot of . . . \nquestionable Siberian stations.'' In other words, measurements at that \npoint are based in part on bad data.\n  Second, other researchers see the Arctic differently, and probably \nmore accurately when describing long-term temperature trends. Polyakov, \nfor example, defined Arctic as northward of 62.5 degrees North. This \n2.5-degree difference is not trivial. Temperatures can change \nsignificantly between 62.5 degrees North and 60 degrees North. In fact, \npushing the geographical boundaries southward, as the Arctic Council \ndid, contributes to a substantial upward bias in temperature \nmeasurements.\n  Not only was the Arctic region arbitrarily defined, it appears that \nmarine and coastal-based data were arbitrarily excluded from the \nreport's temperature record. This is strange, considering two-thirds of \nthe Arctic is covered by the Arctic Ocean. So it seems unreasonable to \nuse only land-based stations, as the Arctic Council did, and not to \ninclude coastal stations, Russian drifting stations in the Arctic \nOcean, and drifting buoys from the International Buoy Programme, as \nPolyakov and his colleagues did.\n  Using such data reveals a less dramatic temperature picture than the \nArctic Council's. In 1993, University of Wisconsin climatologist \nJonathan Kahal examined declassified data collected over the Arctic \nOcean during the Cold War. In a paper in the journal Nature, Kahl found \nan ``absence of evidence for greenhouse warming over the Arctic Ocean \nin the past 40 years'' and a net decline in Arctic temperature. \nAdmittedly, Kahl's temperature history stretches only from 1958 to \n1986. But more importantly, it relies on marine and coastal-based data.\n  Dr. Taylor was among many mystified by these omissions. For him, \nthere is only one possible explanation: ``The [Arctic Climate Impact \nAssessment] appears to be guilty of selective use of data.'' He further \nexplained, ``Many of the trends described in the document begin in the \n1960s or 1970s--cool decades in much of the world--and end in the \nwarmer 1990s and early 2000s. So, for example, temperatures have warmed \nin the last 40 years, and the implication, `if present trends \ncontinue,' is that massive warming will occur in the next century. Yet \ndata are readily available for the 1930s and early 1940s, when \ntemperatures were comparable to (and probably higher than) those \nobserved today. Why not start the trend there? Because there is no net \nwarming over the last 65 years?\n  This is kind of interesting because I can remember also giving a \nspeech where I showed the cover of ``Newsweek'' magazine and the cover \nof ``U.S. News and World Report.'' This was back in the 1970s. And the \nheadlines were: Cooling period is coming; a new ice age is coming. We \nare all going to die. It is the same thing people are saying about a \nwarming climate. If your starting point is at the end of that cold \nperiod, it gives a distortion, if there has been no net warming over \nthe last 65 years.\n  In the pop culture version of global warming, there is no greater \nattraction than melting glaciers and sea ice. Press accounts appear \ndaily of new studies purporting to show a widespread glacial retreat \nstemming from man-made greenhouse gas emissions. Warnings abound that \nthis melting will cause a calamitous rise in sea levels. True to form, \nthe Arctic Council follows the same story line, asserting that, \n``glaciers throughout the Arctic are melting.'' ``This process is \nalready under way,'' the report states, ``with the widespread retreat \nof glaciers, snow cover, and sea ice. This is one reason why climate \nchange is more rapid in the Arctic than elsewhere.'' but is this really \nthe case?\n  Interestingly, the IPCC Third Assessment Report references peer-\nreviewed studies that contradict the Arctic Council's assessments. The \nIPCC, an organization convinced of the validity of the global warming \nconsensus, noted that, ``Glaciers and ice caps in the Arctic also have \nshown retreat in low-lying areas since about 1920,'' but also stated, \n`'However, no increasing melting trend has been observed during the \npast 40 years.''\n  Sonar data on sea ice collected in the 1990s also tell a different \nstory. As the BBC wrote in 2001. ``The latest and most comprehensive \nanalysis yet of the sonar data collected in the 1990s shows little if \nany thinning--at least towards the end of that decade. Indeed, at the \nNorth Pole, there are indications in the data that the ice even got a \nlittle thicker.''\n  What they are saying is, there are some areas that you can visibly go \nto and say yes, glaciers are melting, but in other areas it is getting \nthicker.\n  Among other omissions, the Arctic Council gave little weight to the \nobserved variability of Arctic sea ice thickness. The term ``observed \nvariability'' of sea ice thickness has specific meaning in the Arctic: \nScientists estimate that sea ice mass there can vary by as much as 16 \npercent in a single year. As Dr. Seymour Laxon, a lecturer in the \nDepartment of Space and Climate Physics at the University College \nLondon, explained, ``The observed variability of Arctic sea ice \nthickness contrasts with the concept of a slowly dwindling ice pack, \nproduced by global warming.''\n  So what causes these variations in sea ice mass? In 2002, Dr. Greg \nHolloway, of the Institute for Ocean Sciences in Sidney, Canada, and \nhis colleagues Dr. Tessa Sou, showed that decadal wind pattern changes \ncaused a shifting of Arctic sea ice, creating thinner ice in some \nregions and thicker ice in others. As Dr. Holloway explained, ``It's a \ncircumstance where the ice tends to leave the central Arctic and then \nmostly pile up against the Canadian side, before moving back into the \ncentral Arctic again.'' Based on this research, Dr. Holloway believes \nthat ``we have been a little bit overly stampeded into the idea that \nhere is a terribly alarming melting taking place.''\n  Holloway is not alone in his assessment. In 2003, German researchers \nCornelia Koeberle and Ruediger Gerdes found evidence of natural ``wind \nstress'' strongly affecting variability in Arctic sea ice. ``The \nresults make connecting `global warming' to Arctic ice thinning very \ndifficult for two reasons,'' the researchers wrote. ``First, the large \ndecadal and longer-term variability masks any trend . . . Second, the \nwind stress strongly affects the long-term development of ice volume. A \nlong-term change in wind stress over the Arctic, possibly by an \nincrease in the number of atmospheric circulation states that favor ice \nexport, would affect the ice volume in a similar manner as a \ntemperature increase.''\n  In addition to questionable claims about Arctic sea ice, the Arctic \nreport includes dubious projections about the Greenland Ice Sheet. \nClimate models, the Arctic Council reports, ``project that local \nwarming in Greenland will exceed 3 degrees Celsius during this \ncentury.'' The result? ``Ice sheet models project that a warming of \nthat magnitude would initiate the long-term\n\n[[Page S4167]]\n\nmelting of Greenland Ice Sheet.'' And furthermore, ``Even if climactic \nconditions then stabilized, an increase of this magnitude is projected \nto lead eventually (over centuries) to a virtually complete melting of \nthe Greenland Ice Sheet, resulting in a global sea level rise of about \nseven meters.''\n  This sounds ominous, but again, peer-reviewed literature on the \nsubject, excluded from the Arctic report, tells a countervailing story. \nFor example, a team of experts at Los Alamos National Laboratory \nrecently examined Greenland's instrumental surface temperatures. Here's \nwhat they found: ``Since 1940, however, the Greenland coastal stations \ndata have undergone predominately a cooling trend. At the summit of the \nGreenland ice sheet, the summer average temperature has decreased at \nthe rate of 2.2 [degrees Celsius] per decade since the beginning of the \nmeasures in 1987.'' We are talking about a reduction in temperature, of \nan increase.\n  Finally, the report's projections for the Greenland ice sheet, \nglaciers, and sea ice were based on data obtained from global climate \nmodels. Those projections assume anthropogenic warming, and proceed to \nshow a gradual but persistent melting of glaciers and ice, leading to a \ndangerous rise in sea levels. However, as climate scientists have \nrepeatedly pointed out, climate models are highly imperfect. In fact, \nthey are notoriously inaccurate in how they simulate the complexities \nof the climate system.\n  This is especially true of Arctic climate. According to a letter \nsigned by 11 climate scientists, sent to the Senate Commerce Committee \nlast fall, ``Arctic climate varies dramatically from one region to \nanother, and over time in ways that cannot be accurately reproduced by \nclimate models. The quantitative impacts of natural and anthropogenic \nfactors remain highly uncertain, especially for a region as complex as \nthe Arctic.''\n  Researchers associated with the University of Alaska-Fairbanks \nwholeheartedly endorsed this view. They recently wrote, \n``Unfortunately, most global climate models are not capable of \nsufficiently reproducing the climatological state of the Arctic Ocean, \nsea ice and atmosphere . . . as [an] example, the simulated sea ice \nthickness is overestimated, and its overall pattern is in error, with \nthe thickest ice located in the Siberian instead of the Canadian sector \nof the Arctic Ocean.''\n  Based on these well-documented technological constraints, how can one \ntake seriously the Arctic Council's claim that ``While the models \ndiffer in their projections of some of the features of climate change, \nthey are all in agreement that the world will warm significantly as a \nresult of human activities and that the Arctic is likely to experience \nnoticeable warming particularly early and intensely''?\n  The alarmist nature of the Arctic report is to be expected. How else \ncan they justify its enormous costs of regulating carbon dioxide? We \nknow the costs of this would be enormous. Wharton Econometrics \nForecasting Associates--this is from the Wharton School of Economics, \nnot from Senator Jim Inhofe--estimates that implementing Kyoto would \ncost the average American family of four $2,715 a year. Acknowledging \nthe holes in the science underlying claims of catastrophic global \nwarming would undermine their agenda. What is the agenda? Two \ninternational leaders have said it best.\n  Margot Walstrom, the EU's environmental commissioner, said that Kyoto \nis ``about leveling the playing field for big business worldwide.'' \nFrench President Jacques Chirac said during a speech at The Hague in \nNovember 2000 that Kyoto represents ``the first component of an \nauthentic global governance.'' That is what they want to do, level the \nplaying field for big business worldwide, bring the United States down \nto Third World status eventually, and have an authentic global \ngovernance.\n  Based on these and other major deficiencies, the Arctic Climate \nImpact Assessment hardly serves as compelling proof that greenhouse gas \nemissions are causing unprecedented changes in Arctic climate, or that \ntrends point to a future marred by widespread damage to Arctic \necosystems. To be sure, the report fails to provide a thorough, \nbalanced, comprehensive overview of the most compelling research on \nArctic climate.\n  Instead, the so-called ``synthesis report'' is a biased, selective \nexamination of climate trends in the Arctic. It completely ignores \nwell-known, established facts. For instance, it is firmly established \nthat Arctic temperatures in the late 1930s and early 1940s were higher \nthan in the 1990s and that Greenland's temperatures in recent decades \nhave undergone a cooling trend, not a warming trend. It is also well \nknown that sea ice mass can vary by as much as 16 percent in a single \nyear. Moreover, this report fails the test of transparency and openness \nand lacks virtually any documentation. It reads more like an \nideological tome. Extremist groups are using it as a legal brief to sue \nenergy producers on behalf of Arctic peoples. Hardly surprising.\n  Dr. George Taylor, Oregon's State climatologist, succinctly described \nthe report when he said: ``Nice graphics, but bad science.''\n  This is what we have been hearing. The extremists have to make us \nbelieve that something catastrophic will happen. The same people who \nare talking about global warming today were the ones who, in the 1970s, \nwere talking about global cooling, saying another ice age is coming. It \nis interesting.\n  I recommend reading a book by Michael Creighton called, ``The State \nof Fear.'' Michael Creighton is one of the best-known authors in \nAmerica. He writes fiction; these are novels, but he is a scientist and \nalso a medical doctor. He was going to write a novel on global warming \nand the terrible things that could happen. Instead of that, after he \ndid research, he wrote another novel. While it is fiction, its \nfootnotes are all scientific. I recommend that book. As any thoughtful \nperson who has a scientific background will tell you, the idea of \nglobal warming very well may be the greatest single hoax ever \nperpetrated on the American people.\n  With that, I made the comment before speaking that I am anxious for \nMembers to come down and talk about our bill. We are now under debate \non the motion to proceed to the consideration of the highway bill, H.R. \n3. We will have a vote on that motion to proceed tomorrow morning. The \nvote is set for sometime around 11 o'clock tomorrow morning. I have \nbeen told there are some Members who wish to speak in morning business. \nI would like to inquire, if there are any real long speeches, if at \nsome point someone comes down to speak on the highway bill, or on the \nmotion to proceed to that bill--I would not want a commitment, but I \nwould request they defer to them when they should arrive on the floor.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Challenges in the Senate\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first of all, I am really pleased we \nfinally have the highway bill on the floor. I appreciate the leadership \nof the chairman and the ranking member. This is an authorization that \nis, I think, 2\\1/2\\ years old or so. Many of us have been frustrated. I \nknow the chairman and Senator Jeffords have been frustrated that we \nhave not been able to finish this work. I hope we can finish this bill \nand move it through the Senate.\n  I wanted to comment about another couple of issues. I am worried \nabout the way things develop here in the Senate. We treat serious \nthings too lightly; we treat light things too seriously. We have, it \nseems to me, the framework for a huge brawl in the Senate over \nprocedure, and there are so many challenges facing our country that \nthis President and this Congress are not looking in the eye with the \nthought of responding directly to them. I will mention a few of them \ntoday.\n  Politics, regrettably, in recent times has become a sport in which \none side trashes the other side, and it is either our way, or no way, \nor the highway. Now, we have a circumstance where we are facing serious \nchallenges: we face fiscal policies that are off the rail, the largest \nbudget deficits in history; we face the largest trade deficit in \nhistory, with massive numbers of American jobs being shipped overseas; \nwe face energy problems that are causing severe pain and dislocation, \nand everybody\n\n[[Page S4168]]\n\nknows what the price of gasoline is these days; we struggle with health \ncare costs that are skyrocketing; and all of these issues are hard for \nfamilies to deal with. And yet, despite these issues, we are confronted \nby the prospect of a majority that doesn't like the current rules with \nrespect to judgeships, so they will try to break the rules of the \nSenate, for the first time in history, in order to change the rules \nbecause we have approved only 205 out of 215 judges sent to us by the \nPresident--again, we have approved 97 percent of all of the judges sent \nto us by the President for lifetime appointments on the bench. But \nbecause there are 10 that have not been approved, the President and the \nmajority party believe they want to break the rules of the Senate in \norder to change the rules of the Senate.\n  There are so many other important things we ought to deal with. It is \njust Byzantine that this issue is what we are fighting about. There is \na constitutional role for the Congress--particularly the Senate--with \nrespect to judgeships. The President proposes, and we advise and \nconsent. There is nothing in the Constitution that says we cannot use \nthe rules of the Senate for those few judges we believe are \ninappropriate, those few we think represent the extreme and should not \nbe on the bench for a lifetime.\n  Yet, because, again, 3 percent of the judges have not been approved, \nwhile 97 percent have, we have the prospect of what is commonly called \nthe ``nuclear'' option of trying to change the Senate rules by breaking \nthe Senate rules.\n  I will tell you what I think we should be working on. First, health \ncare costs. The fact is, when most families sit around their supper \ntable and talk about their lives, they are talking about things that \nrelate to their everyday existence: Do I have a good job? Does it pay \nwell? Do I have job security? Do grandpa and grandma have access to \ngood health care? Are we sending our kids to good schools? Do we live \nin a safe neighborhood?\n  These issues affect the daily lives of the American people. Health \ncare is not an option. When you are sick, you need health care. We have \n45 million people without health insurance. We have the cost of health \ncare skyrocketing. It is rising at a much more rapid pace than \ninflation. The cost of prescription drugs is going out of sight. Yet, \nis this Congress tackling health care issues? No, we are not. Will we \nallow legislation on the floor of the Senate that would provide for the \nsafe reimportation of prescription drugs to put downward pressure on \nprescription drugs? No. Will we allow the Federal Government to \nnegotiate lower prices with the pharmaceutical companies like the VA? \nWill we allow that negotiation for the Medicare Program? No. In fact, \nthis Congress explicitly says you may not do that. It is unbelievable. \nWe have these huge health care challenges, but we will not look that \nissue in the eye.\n  Our budget deficits are the largest in the history of our country. We \njust passed an $80 billion emergency bill last week. We knew for 2 \nyears that is what it would cost--$5 billion, $6 billion a month in \nIraq and Afghanistan--and there was zero in the President's budget \nrequest for it. So they proposed spending it on an emergency basis. \nNobody talks about raising money for it; just spend it. In fact, I have \nraised questions about how it is being spent--and I offered an \namendment saying we are being stolen blind with respect to contractors \nin Iraq--to wit, Halliburton. Halliburton is charging us for 42,000 \nmeals a day served to U.S. soldiers, when it turns out they are serving \nonly 14,000 meals a day. In my hometown, they have a word for that sort \nof thing.\n  I asked for an investigation into this kind of waste, fraud, and \nabuse in contracting. It is massive. But you cannot get a committee to \ninvestigate that. The Congress doesn't want to have a select committee \nto investigate that. So it is just throwing the money out the door in \nhopes that some of it will stick. In fact, there is massive waste, \nfraud, and abuse and everybody knows it. But nobody wants to confront \nit.\n  Education. We have a serious problem with education in this country. \nThere are 400,000 qualified high-school kids that will not go to \ncollege this year because of financial burdens, and another 220,000 \nkids won't go to college because they simply cannot afford it. You have \nwell over a half-million qualified kids who will not be going to \ncollege who should be in college. We know college tuition has risen 28 \npercent, after inflation, in the last 4 years. We have not considered \nthe reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. We extended it, but \nthat should have been reauthorized several years ago. It is set to \nexpire. The President's budget would eliminate the Perkins student loan \nprogram, Upward Bound, and a series of other programs that I think are \nvery important. Pell grants have largely been stagnant in terms of \ntheir level, while tuition has gone way out of sight.\n  We don't look energy right in the eye, although I must say there is \nhope here. I met with Senators Domenici and Bingaman. I am a senior \nmember on the Energy Committee, and I hope we can bring a bill to the \nfloor of the Senate. That is a bipartisan bill.\n  Go to the gas pump these days, and then read in the paper after you \npaid for that gas, that Exxon reported the highest profit ever reported \nfor one quarter by any corporation. Think of that. We have a revenue-\nsharing system by which the American taxpayer, the American consumer \nshares their money with the Saudis, the Kuwaitis, the Iraqis, the \nVenezuelans, and others who have the oil, and then the oil companies \nthat are the conduit for that oil are making record profits as well.\n  If anything demands an investigation, it is that, in my judgment. We \nneed an energy policy that does not hold this country hostage to oil, \n60 percent of which comes from off our shores.\n  These are a few of the issues we ought to stare straight in the eye, \nand those of us who are not part of the political extreme--and there \nare too many these days who are perverting the political process in \nthis country, I think a shameful perversion of the political process in \nmany ways--but I hope those of us who are part of the strong political \ncenter in America will finally convince this administration and this \nCongress to take a hard look at the real challenges our country faces \nand then begin the long, challenging work to try to address them.\n  This is a great place. We are lucky to be here, lucky to be alive \nnow. There is no place like it on Earth. It is our job as caretakers of \nthis wonderful democracy to fix problems as we see them, to address \nproblems, not to go off on these political searches to figure out who \nis the worst. The question is not who is the worst in the political \nsystem of ours, the question is whose ideas are the best that can move \nthis country forward and give our country and our children the prospect \nfor a better and brighter future.\n  I have much more to say, but because of time constraints today, I \nwill leave it at that and say I hope as these weeks unfold we will \nbegin to address the substance of the real challenges facing our \ncountry--Federal budget deficits, trade deficits, health care, \neducation, energy, and other issues--all of which have a significant \nimpact on the way we live in the country and all of which will have a \nsignificant impact on America's future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I want to make a couple comments in \nresponse to my good friend from North Dakota.\n  First, I encourage Members to come down to the Chamber. The current \norder of business is the motion to proceed to the highway bill. It is \nvery important. It is critical. There is nothing we are dealing with \nright now that is more important. There is so much at stake, as I \nalready outlined. We need to have more Members come down. Certainly, if \nI am talking, I will defer to them if they do come to the floor.\n\n\n                   Partnership for Fish and Wildlife\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I wish to share with you an experience \nfrom last Friday. We had a field hearing in Oklahoma on the Partnership \nfor Fish and Wildlife. This is a program not many people know about. It \nis one that has\n\n[[Page S4169]]\n\nnot ever been authorized, but it is one that has gone year to year with \nan appropriation, whereby a landowner who is trying to do something for \nthe environment, trying to do something for conservation, trying to do \nsomething for habitat will put up $3 for every $1 the Fish and Wildlife \nService puts up to join a partnership with them. They have come up with \nsome incredible results, and it shows that those areas of Government \nwhere you work with Government and not have Government dictating \nmandates to individuals or to communities works so much better. This is \na model for other programs. Consequently, I thought Earth Day was a \ngood day for me, as chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, to introduce the bill, which I have introduced, to authorize \nthis Partnership for Fish and Wildlife Program.\n  Also, there is a vacancy that has occurred with the Director of the \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. We have a Southwest regional director \nby the name of H. Dale Hall. He came up for our hearing on Friday in \nOklahoma. He is one of the incredible, dedicated Federal workers. It \nseems to me he would be an excellent Director for the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service. I would like to nominate this man for that purpose.\n  He is a wildlife biologist. Mr. Hall meets the qualifications for the \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director as established by 16 United \nStates Code 742B, being knowledgeable in the principles of fisheries \nand wildlife management by reason of education and experience. Mr. Hall \nreceived a bachelor of science degree in biology and chemistry from \nCumberland College in Williamsburg, KY, and a master's degree in \nfisheries science from Louisiana State University.\n  He had military experience prior to joining the Service in 1978. Mr. \nHall served 4 years in the U.S. Air Force beginning in 1968 with \noverseas assignments in Italy and the Philippines.\n  He has private sector experience. After returning to civilian life in \n1972, Mr. Hall managed catfish farms in the Mississippi Delta region \nfor Eden Fisheries and Farm, Inc.\n  He has experienced all kinds of awards. He joined the Service in 1978 \nand has worked in the Mississippi Valley, Houston field office, the \nWashington, DC, office, the Pacific regional office, the Southwest \nregional office, and now serves as regional director for the Southwest \nregion. That is Oklahoma, Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico.\n  He was honored as one of the Service's 10 most outstanding merit pay \nemployees for 1986. In February of 1996, he was presented with the \nDepartment of Interior's Meritorious Service Award by then-Secretary \nBruce Babbitt.\n  I nominate this man for this position. I think he would make an \nexcellent Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n  I again reiterate that the order of business now is on a motion to \nproceed to the highway bill. Cloture has already been filed. We will be \nvoting on cloture tomorrow morning. I cannot think of one thing we are \ndoing now that is more important than getting a highway bill. We have \nbeen operating on extensions for a long period of time. When we do \nextensions, we do not get any of the benefits of streamlining, we do \nnot get any of the safety benefits, we do not get any of the school-to-\nwork programs, or any of the other programs. These are things that need \nto be done.\n  All an extension does is extend what is currently out there. \nTherefore, the States and communities do not know what to expect. They \ndo not know how to anticipate how much money is going to be there or \nwhether any of these programs to protect the environment are going to \nbe there, or any streamlining programs.\n  I cannot tell you how important it is we not operate on extensions \nbut instead that we do pass this highway bill. We should have done it \nlast year. Last year, we had the bill that came up. The President of \nthe United States felt it should be a smaller number. We felt if the \nbill is paid for--and at that time the Finance Committee, under the \nchairmanship of Chuck Grassley and the ranking member, Max Baucus, came \nup with money that could be raised for that purpose so it would not add \nto the deficit. Consequently, we passed a bill out of the Senate that \nwas $318 billion for a 6-year reauthorization. That would have been \nfine. It went to conference and got hung up in conference. One or two \npeople stopped us from having this bill. Now all of America is \nsuffering for it.\n  This is our second run at it. We are almost out of time. The current \nextension expires on May 31. If we do not have a bill by May 31, then \nwe are going to have to operate on an extension. This is something that \nwould certainly be to the detriment of all States.\n  Obviously, we are all prejudiced for our own States. My State is \nOklahoma. Oklahoma has very severe problems with bridges. We need to \ncorrect those problems. Border States have problems with NAFTA traffic \ncoming up, south to north, and back down. That adds a lot.\n  We are trying to do something with the Borders and Corridors Program. \nIf we do not have a bill, we will not have that program. We have a lot \nof things that are very significant and need to be addressed.\n  I encourage my fellow Members to come to the floor and talk about the \nmotion to proceed to the highway bill, talk about the highway \nconditions in their States, and help us to get this bill passed.\n  I will say this, the bill we had last year, even though it was $318 \nbillion over a 6-year period, we enjoyed a 76-to-21 majority in this \nbody. I know the distinguished Presiding Officer was not here at the \ntime, but I had an opportunity to talk to all the Members who were not \nhere to vote last time about how they would vote, and virtually all of \nthem are supporting this highway bill.\n  It is essentially the same bill. We have been working on it, my \nfriend from Vermont, the ranking Democrat of the committee I chair, we \nhave been working on this now for 2\\1/2\\, almost 3 years. We can never \nmake up what happened. We understand that. When you get into a \ncomplicated formula and consider all the things I outlined a few \nminutes ago, there are going to be some people who do not want to have \na bill. There are procedural steps that can be taken to stop us from \nhaving a bill. All we want is to have a vote.\n  Speaking of a vote, I do not have a better friend than the Senator \nfrom North Dakota. We disagree on issues politically. He made some \ncomments to which I would like to respond. First on judges.\n  I do not think my State of Oklahoma is that different from other \nStates. I do not think it is different from North Carolina. I do not \nthink it is different from North Dakota or most States. When I walk \naround and visit people in my State of Oklahoma--for 19 years I have \ngone back on a weekly basis, so I am there talking to normal people, \nbecause there are not that many here in Washington--I find out what \nconcerns them. They are concerned about a lot of the issues with which \nwe deal.\n  Certainly, they are concerned about the war in Iraq. They are \nconcerned about the fact that we are finally winning the war against \nterrorism. We are doing a good job over there. I was there a few days \nago and made a point, since I am on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, to spend some time in the Sunni Triangle where they are \nsupposed to dislike us the most. I have never seen anything like it. In \nFallujah, there is a guy who was the brigade commander for Saddam \nHussein who hated Americans before. Then he got the title of brigade \ncommander for the Iraqi security forces, and he started working with \nour Marines over there. He started loving them so much, he said when \nthey rotated out--and this includes embedded training where his troops \nwere training with our Marines; our Marines were helping to train these \nindividuals--when our Marines rotated and left, he said they actually \ncried. He has renamed the Fallujah Iraqi security forces. They are now \ncalled the Fallujah Marines, named after our marines. That is what is \nhappening in the Sunni Triangle.\n\n  I went to Tikrit, the hometown of Saddam Hussein. During the training \nprocess in Tikrit, outside one of the stations they were training in \nwas a car bomb that killed 10 Iraqis and severely injured 30 more. In \nTikrit, the 40 families who either lost through death or severe \ninjuries people who are being trained to fight for the Iraqi security \nforces substituted other members of their families. It is incredible \nbecause they have this great love.\n\n[[Page S4170]]\n\n  We got in a Blackhawk helicopter and flew all over the Sunni Triangle \nat less than 100 feet. It is the safest way to fly. There are \nterrorists out there who can hit the helicopter.\n  As we went across, we saw little kids come up on villages waving \nAmerican flags. There are many people, I am sure, right now who send \ncare packages to our troops over there. What these troops are doing \nwith the care packages is taking the candy and cookies and repackaging \nthem. Then we go 100 feet over the Sunni Triangle, when the kids are \nwaving, and they throw the candy out to the kids. There is a love that \nis indescribable. We never hear that from the media back here. The \nmedia is very biased. The networks are biased, and we do not hear the \nsuccess stories. Good things are happening.\n  I was there a few weeks before that after the January 30 election. \nEveryone was saying the election was not going to go off. People risked \ntheir life to vote, and they told me they could not see the ballot \nbecause of the tears in their eyes. Another one told me it occurred to \nher when she voted that it was not only ending a 35-year bloody regime \nof Saddam Hussein, but it was the first time in 7,000 years she and the \nIraqi people were having a right, an opportunity for self-\ndetermination. It is a huge thing happening over there.\n  We all know about the weapons of mass destruction and trying to \ndiscredit the President. We knew there were terrorist training camps. \nWe have gotten rid of them. We are seeing a new democracy emerge and \ntotally change the Middle East. It has been successful.\n  I only say that because there are a lot of important things going on, \nand one is, of course, dealing with the current deficit. We are going \nto have deficits. My good friend from North Dakota was critical of the \ndeficit that is taking place right now. I think it has been pretty well \nestablished--in fact, even the Democrats have agreed--that this \nrecession actually started in March of 2000, which was under the \nClinton administration. When you go into recession, for every 1-percent \ndecrease in economic activity, that translates to $46 billion in \nrevenues.\n  We had the revenue going down at the same time we had 9/11. We are in \na war and we cannot come out of a deficit while we are in a war. We had \na reduction in the military. I do not criticize the Clinton \nadministration for what happened to the military after the first gulf \nwar, but when the military is downsized, some of our modernization \nprograms are stopped and it is expensive.\n  Right now I do not know how many American people realize that we are \nactually sending our kids out to battle with equipment that is not as \ngood as our potential adversaries. Our best artillery piece, for \nexample, is the Paladin. The Paladin is World War II technology. After \neach shot, you have to get out and swab the breach, like you used to \nhave to do during World War II. Yet there are five countries right now, \nincluding South Africa, that are making a better non-line-of-sight \ncannon than our Paladin. Our kids do not have as good equipment, and \nthat is because our modernization program came to somewhat of a \nscreeching halt.\n  I was very proud of GEN John Jumper back in I think it was 1998 when \nout of his frustration he was trying to say we have to do something \nabout our modernization programs; that our best strike vehicle is \ncurrently the F-15 and the F-16 and the Russians are making the SU-30s \nand 31s, as they were at the time, and selling them to potential \nadversaries, and they are better than our F-15s and F-16s. When we have \nour F-22s online, and our Joint Strike Fighter, we will change that, \nbut we have to progressively do this, and it is expensive. That is why \nwe will continue to have deficits for a while until we get this thing \ndone.\n  In all fairness, we have to realize that, No. 1, the administration \ninherited a deficit; No. 2, we are at war; and, No. 3, we are \nrebuilding a military operation.\n  Getting back to the judges, as I said, I do not think Oklahoma is a \nlot different from other States. When I go down the street and I talk \nto people, they are much more concerned about what is happening with \nthe judicial decisions and liberal judges trying to make law from the \nbenches. They are concerned about school prayer, gay marriage, and the \nPledge of Allegiance with ``one Nation under God'' coming out. These \nthings bother people back in Oklahoma. Maybe they do not bother people \nin other States but they do in Oklahoma. All we want are circuit judges \nto be nominated and then given a simple majority vote on the floor, so \nthat we can determine whether that nomination by the President can be \nconfirmed.\n  I do appreciate what the Senator from North Dakota was saying. \nHowever, I have to say to my knowledge never in the history--sometimes \npeople say, well, how about Judge Bork back several years ago? That was \na different situation altogether. Never in history has there been a \nfilibuster of circuit judge nominees. It should not be 60 people to \nconfirm a judge; it should be 51 people. All we want is a vote. We do \nnot care how it comes out. That is going to be the will of the Senate, \nbut the Constitution specifically says ``Advice and Consent of the \nSenate.'' That is a majority, and that is all we really want.\n  I know there are liberals who have a liberal agenda who do not want \nto have conservatives or constructionists confirmed on the various \ncircuit courts and Federal benches, and ultimately the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. But I can assure my colleagues that the vast majority of people \nin Oklahoma do.\n  Lastly, I do agree with the Senator from North Dakota when he talked \nabout the need for an energy policy. I became aware of this and \nconcerned with this way back in the early 1980s when Ronald Reagan was \nPresident of the United States. I believed that he should have had an \nenergy policy for America. Quite frankly, even though he was my \nfavorite guy in contemporary history, he did not do it. There were so \nmany other things facing his two terms that he was not able to come up \nwith an energy policy.\n  I can remember when Secretary Hodel and I would go around the \ncountry, we would make speeches about how our dependence on foreign \ncountries for our ability to fight a war for our energy supply was not \nan energy issue, it was a national security issue. We tried to convince \npeople of that, and we were not successful.\n  Then, of course, along came other administrations and they did not do \nit, either. I thought certainly the first Bush administration, since he \nhad an oil background, would be more concerned about it. But this \nPresident does. He says we should have a comprehensive energy policy \nfor America, and one of the cornerstones should be a limit as to how \nmuch we should be dependent upon foreign countries for our energy \nsupply--or I will put it a different way, for our ability to fight a \nwar.\n  So here we have a situation where back when I started making speeches \nabout our dependency on foreign countries for our oil was when we were \ndependent for about 34 percent. Now it is up to 65 percent. We are \ndependent upon foreign countries for our ability to fight a war twice \nas much as we were back in the 1980s. So it is going in the wrong \ndirection.\n  What we need is an energy bill. I was very glad to see the vote on \nANWR. It is kind of interesting, the Arctic National Wildlife, that \ntiny little part of the wildlife reservation that people are concerned \nabout, all of the Natives in Alaska want it, all the Alaskans want it, \nthe House wants it up in Alaska, the Senate wants it, everybody else \nwants it, but we refused to give it to them to allow them to explore \nand produce on ANWR. Now they can do that.\n  A comprehensive energy bill should have an oil and a gas component to \nit. It should have fossil fuels, coal, nuclear energy, and renewable \nenergy. If we can have that, we can have an energy bill. I think we are \ngoing to have one. I am particularly concerned about it because I chair \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee and about one-third of the \nEnergy bill is in the jurisdiction of my committee. We are going to do \nwhat we can to work with the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, Mr. \nDomenici, to try to make that happen.\n  I encourage Members to come to the floor, and in the event they do I \nwould certainly relinquish the floor to anyone who wants to talk about \nthe highway bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S4171]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. What is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to proceed to the highway bill.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to \nspeak as in morning business for a period not to exceed 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Dependency on Foreign Oil\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this morning, Americans braced themselves \nfor another week of devastating news about the gas pump. This morning, \nAmericans learned again of the record increases in the price of oil in \nAmerica. When they turn on the news tonight, they are not going to \nlearn of anything that has been done by this Congress or the \nadministration in the past months or even past years. They are not \ngoing to see Washington taking the necessary steps to end our \ndependency on foreign oil. Instead, people will see President Bush \nmeeting with Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah, a stark reminder of our \ndangerous dependence on foreign oil and how much that dependence \nthreatens our economy as well as our national security.\n  The President offers strong words against nations that sponsor \nterror, but for those in control of 65 percent of the world's oil \nsupply, those words are compromised from the get-go. That is wrong, but \nit is fundamentally what happens when the administration is committed \nto an energy future that is dependent on oil, oil, and more oil, at all \ncosts, even if that cost is our national security.\n  The fact is, we are more dependent on foreign oil today than ever \nbefore. Despite the sharp rhetoric of the 1970s and the initial effort \nto try to be less dependent on oil, it has consistently increased. This \ndependence slows our economy, harms our environment, dilutes our \nnational security, and it burdens Americans with the high gas prices \nthey face today. Sadly, the President's energy bill, which we are going \nto soon debate in the Senate, fundamentally ignores these problems, and \nit does nothing to lower gas prices.\n  In the last days, the administration has conceded ``changes to \nproduction, consumption, imports and prices are negligible under the \nplan submitted to the Congress.'' Frankly, Washington has danced around \nthis statement for a year now. But last week, President Bush himself \nacknowledged the truth. He said:\n\n       [The] energy bill wouldn't change the price at the pump \n     today. I know that and you know that.\n\n  So if we all know that, why pass this Energy bill along in its \ncurrent form when real solutions are staring us in the face? Americans \nare paying an average of $2.28 a gallon at the pump. That is up 6 cents \nin the last week, over 50 percent in the last year, and up a staggering \n56 percent since 2001. The President's so-called energy plan does \nnothing to reduce our dependency on foreign oil. The President's own \neconomists found oil imports will actually increase 85 percent by 2025 \nunder a proposal such as the one we see in the Congress. Less than 5 \npercent of the incentives in this bill are devoted to developing \nalternative sources of energy. That is 5 percent for the future, 95 \npercent for the status quo.\n  In 2002, when the Senate passed an energy bill with a bipartisan vote \nof 88 to 11, the bill provided for a balanced tax package: 50 percent \nof the benefits to oil and gas and 50 percent to renewables. By \nabandoning that balanced, forward-looking approach, this bill sells out \nour Nation's dream of an energy independent future.\n  Why are we taking the time in the Senate and the House to discuss an \nenergy bill that does not take the steps available to begin to free us \nfrom our dependency? The failure to aggressively address the dependency \nwill condemn a generation of Americans to higher gas prices, and the \nproblem will only get worse. The era when the United States, Japan, and \nEurope comprised the bulk of the world's demand for oil is long over. \nOil consumption from developing Asian nations is going to more than \ndouble in the next 25 years, from 15 million to 32 million barrels a \nday. Chinese consumption will grow from 5 million to nearly 13 million \nper day. India's consumption will rise from 2 to more than 5 million \nbarrels per day.\n  The escalating demand for foreign oil is simply unsustainable. Every \nAmerican who has taken an economics class, who owns a small business, \nor who balances the family checkbook understands that when demand for \nthe product goes up and supply of that product is limited, prices are \ngoing to go through the roof. If you do not own your own product, that \nis great, but if you do, you are in trouble. Obviously, we do not. The \nfact is that the United States only has 3 percent of the world's oil \nreserves. So no matter what happens, we are going to remain dependent \nif fossil fuel and oil are going to remain the staple of our \ntransportation, heating, and other product sources in the United \nStates.\n  In reality, international demand for oil is going up, and prices are \ngoing up as that demand goes up. There is little we can do to stop it \nunless we change the fundamentals on which we are currently producing \nand providing for the various oil needs of our Nation. We cannot drill \nour way out of this problem under any scenario whatever. Whether we \ndrill in Alaska or even the oil in the deep water of the gulf, we \ncannot drill our way out of it.\n  America needs to move forward in the technology race. We need to \ninvent our way out of it. The spectacle of an American President \nliterally reduced to asking--some would describe it as begging--another \ncountry to open the spigots and try to provide some momentary relief is \nreally its own statement about where we find ourselves today. The fact \nis, what we ought to be doing is accelerating research and development \nin our country.\n  Today's meeting with the Saudis really underscores what is wrong with \nthe energy policy of our country. The danger of maintaining our \ndependence on foreign oil is so obvious that Americans cannot help but \nquestion the actions of this administration. The actions do not meet \ntheir words. The President has said the right things. Last week, he \nsaid:\n\n       With oil at more than $50 a barrel . . . energy companies \n     do not need taxpayer funded incentives.\n\n  So he said the right thing. But the facts tell a different story. The \nEnergy bill provides 95 percent of the tax benefits to oil and gas \ncompanies, with over $8 billion directly going to the oil and gas \ncompanies of the country. Only 5 percent--less than even in the bill we \npassed 2 years ago in the Senate, or 3 years ago--is going to go to \nthose things that would actually provide Americans with relief. At a \ntime when oil and gas prices are at historic highs, our energy policy \nought to be aimed at investing in new and renewable sources of energy, \nnot lining the pockets of the special interests.\n  On energy, the administration has not been leveling with the American \npeople. I think the President and Congress continue to miss an \nextraordinary opportunity. Most public policy forces us to make \ndifficult tradeoffs: foreign versus domestic, urban versus rural, \nconsumer versus business. But energy policy does not require us to do \nthat. Other than the big oil companies, everyone benefits from reducing \nour dependence on foreign oil. Energy policy provides us with a unique \nopportunity to address a huge group of challenges all at the same time.\n  If we lead the world in investing in new energy technologies, we \ncreate thousands of high-paying jobs right here in America. If we learn \nto tap clean energy sources, we preserve a clean environment for our \nfamilies and future generations. We reduce mercury and acid rain. If we \nremove the burden of high gas prices, American consumers will have more \ncash in their pockets to spend on consumption products or on savings or \non college or other things. That will all give our economy the boost it \nneeds. Most importantly, if we end our dependence on foreign oil, we \nstrengthen our national security.\n  The Energy bill before the Congress accomplishes none of these goals. \nIn fact, it weakens all of them. Let me focus on one of those things \nthat it weakens, our national security. Increased American energy \ndependence further entangles our Nation in unstable regions of the \nworld and forces us\n\n[[Page S4172]]\n\neven to compromise our values. In exchange for oil, we transfer wealth \nto people who have done us harm and would do us harm in the future.\n  This is, obviously, as bad for our troops and for those serving \nabroad as it is for people who experience the high gas prices here. We \nrisk being drawn into dangerous conflicts because of our dependency in \na particular region. We also see an already overburdened military that \nhas to bear the consequence of that.\n  In recent years, U.S. forces have had to help protect the Cano Limon \npipeline in Colombia. Our military had to train indigenous forces to \nprotect the pipeline in Georgia. We plan to spend $100 million on a \nspecial network of police officers and special forces units to guard \noil facilities around the Caspian Sea and to continue to search for \nbases in Africa so we can protect all of the facilities there. Our Navy \npatrolled tanker routes in the Indian Ocean, South China Sea, and the \nWestern Pacific.\n  The reality is, we have to protect oil because that is what protects \nour way of life today. This is a serious issue, with real consequences, \nbecause of the unstable nature of conflict-ridden, oil-producing areas \nwhich challenge our security.\n  In the spring of 2004, insurgents attacked an Iraqi oil platform. \nThere was violence against oil workers in Nigeria. The result was to \npress global oil output and record-high gasoline prices. We were \nhelpless to stop it. I do not think any American wants to be helpless \nwhere national security is concerned.\n  Our dependence on foreign oil creates just the sort of alliances that \nGeorge Washington warned against in 1796. These alliances with foreign \nsuppliers leave us more vulnerable, and they can crumble the \nfoundations of our economic and national security.\n  The most dangerous aspect of this is that we are not alone in this \ndependency. I mentioned it earlier: International demand for oil is \nrising at an alarming rate. Another word for ``demand'' is \n``competition.'' Another word for ``competition'' is ``race.'' At this \nrate, the great powers of the world may resume the race to secure the \nremaining energy reserves. That is an alarming scenario, but it is \nexactly the course we find ourselves on. With strong leadership, we can \navoid it. But we cannot do it without a balanced energy plan that ends \nour dependence on foreign oil.\n\n  If anyone needs an example of how energy dependence can shortchange \nnational security, look no further than the war on terror itself. If we \nassume oil miraculously drops back to $30 a barrel--no one assumes \nthat, but if you did--over the next 25 years, the United States will \nsend over 3 trillion American dollars out of the country, much of it to \nregimes that do not share our values, and even, in many cases, our \ngoals.\n  It is bad enough to think that those $3 trillion are not going to go \ndirectly into the American economy, that they are going to go to other \ncountries. It is worse to consider the impact on our volatile \nrelationship with regimes such as the House of Saud, fragile as it \nfinds itself increasingly today.\n  Our dependence on Saudi oil is a bad bargain for the war on terror. \nIn the past, Hamas received almost half of its funding from Saudi \nArabia. We know al-Qaida has relied on prominent Saudi Arabians for \nfinancing, and Saudi Arabia sponsors clerics who still, after all the \nrhetoric, promote the ideology of terror.\n  We all know what is going to happen today. The President is going to \nask Prince Abdullah to raise production. But we have to be honest with \nthe American people and acknowledge it is a short-term fix at best, and \nit is one that carries its risks.\n  In the year 2000, Governor Bush said he would ``jawbone OPEC'' to \n``open the spigots.'' But 5 years later, either he has not jawboned \nenough or it is not important. It is time the administration learned \nthe only long-term solution to America's energy crisis and to our \nsecurity itself is to end our dependence on foreign oil.\n  National security is the most inexcusable casualty of our energy \npolicy. But again, it is not the only one. Federal Reserve Chairman \nAlan Greenspan has said:\n\n       Markets for oil and natural gas have been subject to a \n     degree of strain over the past year not experienced for a \n     generation.\n\n  I might say, respectfully, it may not have been experienced for a \ngeneration, but it was entirely predictable that this would come around \nagain, particularly when you look at the development rates of China, \nIndia, and other Asian and South Asian countries.\n  As the chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers said:\n\n       High energy prices are now a drag on our economy.\n\n  That is the Republican administration speaking for itself.\n  This administration's energy policy works for Saudi Arabia, it works \nfor the countries that get those trillions of dollars, it works for big \noil and gas companies--all of which have record profits. I think one of \nthe top companies had a 213-percent increase in profits, others 146 \npercent, others in the double digits. Show me the American family whose \nincome went up commensurately. Show me most American businesses that \nare struggling with health care costs and now have increased costs of \ntransportation. The American trucking industry has billions of dollars, \nperhaps $20 billion paid out because of the rise in the cost of fuel.\n  So everyone is losing: consumers, small businesses, the environment, \nour troops, our security--everyone but the oil and gas companies.\n  We need an energy policy that works for America and works for the \n21st century. We have successfully moved from different sources of fuel \nin our history. We went from wood to coal. We went from coal to oil.\n  We went from oil to a mix of oil and gas and coal and nuclear and \nhydroelectric, and now we are talking about wind power and other \nsources. We have the capacity to have various kinds of additives and \neven biodiesel and other forms, but we are not moving rapidly to secure \nthe marketplace for those alternatives.\n  It is time now for America to make its next transition in fuel, to \nmove to a mix of solar and wind and biomass and fuel cells and clean \ncoal and other wonders of American ingenuity. We have huge reserves of \ncoal. But despite all the rhetoric, the administration hasn't even \nadequately funded the clean coal technology program. We need to tap \nAmerica's strength. The new president of MIT wrote a couple of articles \nthe other day pointing out how America is slipping backwards in \ntechnology. All you have to do is pick up any of the analyses on \ncompetitiveness in technology in America today. America is producing \nfewer engineers, fewer scientists. Fewer kids in college are going into \nscience and the physical sciences. Less money is being put into the R \nto move us into that competitive edge.\n  That competitive edge is what built the economy of the 1990s. It is \nwhat helped us to be able to create the high value-added jobs so we \nmoved to an unemployment rate that was the lowest in the modern history \nof our Nation, and we paid down debt. We invested in the long-term \nfuture of our country. We have seen a complete reversal of that in the \nlast 4\\1/2\\ years.\n  I hope this Congress will do what it ought to do, not start pitting \npeople against each other according to definitions of faith, but come \nhere with faith in America and American ingenuity and understand that \nwe need to tap America's strength. We need to tap our markets, our \ncapacity for invention, innovation, and our values. That is the way we \nwill control our own destiny. We need to embrace and foster a \nrevolution toward an energy world that benefits our environment, our \neconomy and, most importantly, our security.\n  The President's energy plan will bring us more of the same--the \nstatus quo, a more dangerous future of energy dependence and high \nprices. It is time we came together with a real energy policy that \nworks for the American people and puts Americans back in charge of \ntheir future and liberates our children from the stranglehold of fossil \nfuel.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the regular order is the cloture motion on \nthe motion to proceed to the highway bill. This is one we are very much \nconcerned about. I have said several times I am hoping Members will \ncome to the floor and speak on the highway bill. I know the \ndistinguished Senator from\n\n[[Page S4173]]\n\nIllinois wants to be heard right now. Let me only make one comment.\n  Earlier on I talked a little bit about the Energy bill. The \ndistinguished junior Senator from Massachusetts started off with a \nquote by the President that was not quite complete. What the President \nsaid was the Energy bill would have no immediate impact on gas prices \nbut long-term gas prices will be affected by an energy bill. I made \nthat very clear a few minutes ago when I talked about the fact we have \nbeen trying to get an energy bill since the 1980s.\n  I don't say this in a partisan way because we tried to get an energy \nbill during the Reagan administration and the Carter administration \nbefore that, the first Bush administration, and the Clinton \nadministration. We were unable to do it. It was not until this \nPresident came along and offered an energy bill or an energy policy for \nAmerica. It is long in waiting. Obviously, supply and demand tells us \nthat portion of energy that is generated by oil and gas is going to be \ncheaper if we are able to do it locally and do it in this country \nwithout depending upon foreign sources of oil.\n  We know what happened in OPEC days back in the 1970s. We know we can \nbe held hostage again. It is a very serious problem. But an energy bill \nshould include all forms of energy. I agree with the Senator from \nMassachusetts, we should be concentrating also on technology, on \nrenewables. Certainly I disagree with the Senator from Massachusetts \nwhen he says he wants clean coal technology and he wants to be able to \nutilize coal. It was the Democrats in the committee I chair who killed \nthe Clear Skies--didn't kill it, but delayed it--Initiative of the \nPresident which would have the most dramatic reduction on pollutants, \non NOx, SOx, and mercury pollution than any \nPresident has ever advocated in the history of America, a 70-percent \nreduction. To do this we had to continue to have clean coal technology. \nThat is part of the bill, as are oil and gas and nuclear and \nrenewables.\n  We made an effort to do that and were unable to do it on a partisan \nline. If the Senator from Massachusetts is interested in having a \nbipartisan approach to the use of clean coal technology and to expand \nthe use of coal, we need to look at all of the above, all of the forms \nof energy. I will join him in that program.\n  The Senator from Illinois wants to be recognized as in morning \nbusiness. Since I do want to get back to the highway bill, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senator from Illinois be recognized for 30 \nminutes as in morning business and then immediately following his 30 \nminutes, I be recognized for 30 minutes as in morning business, and \nthen we would go back to the regular order. I encourage Members who are \ninterested in the motion to proceed to the highway bill to come to the \nfloor, to be heard, and so we can recognize them for that purpose.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I overheard the request, the Senator from Oklahoma \nsuggested 30 minutes in morning business.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes, for the Senator from Illinois, unless he desires \nmore.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That should be adequate. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                           Judicial Nominees\n\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor with some feelings of \ndisappointment. I had hoped that on reflection, Majority Leader Frist \nwould change his mind about taking part in a rally yesterday in \nKentucky with groups that claim anyone who opposes President Bush's \njudicial nominees is opposed to ``people of faith.'' The organizers of \nthat rally, the Family Research Council, called their rally ``Justice \nSunday.'' I agree with Bob Edgar, general secretary of the National \nCouncil of Churches. A better name would have been ``Just Us Sunday.''\n  This Republican religious group is trying to redefine faith to fit \nits own narrow definition. What is their test? Does their definition of \nfaith turn to the Bible? You know the biblical test, how do you treat \nthe least of your brethren. No, the litmus test of faith for this group \nis as follows: Do you agree that a President--namely President Bush--\nought to be able to ignore the Constitution, the rules of the Senate, \nand 200 years of Senate tradition to appoint people to the Federal \nbench for lifetime appointments even if those nominees hold extreme \npolitical views outside the mainstream of America?\n  That is their test of faith. If you say yes, then you are a person of \nfaith. If you say no, they would brand you as anti-God and antifamily.\n  The depth we have reached in this political debate that the majority \nleader of the Senate would add his name and his words to a rally which \nis so divisive, which tries to make a constitutional issue a religious \nissue. I had hoped Senator Frist would decide not to take part in it. I \nhoped he would have used his leadership position to discourage those \nwho are using this religious McCarthyism that seems to be gripping our \npolitical system now that the Republicans are in control of the House \nand the Senate. Unfortunately, he did not.\n  He sent a taped message which contained within it, I will concede, \nsome conciliatory words warning those involved not to go too far, as \nSenator Lindsey Graham did yesterday on a television show which I \nshared. But unfortunately, I am sure those who were involved with the \nFamily Research Council were heartened by the appearance of Senator \nFrist.\n  Now we are learning that placing your own candidates in lifetime \nFederal judgeships is not enough for this group.\n  They are also plotting to rid the bench of Federal judges they don't \nlike. The Los Angeles Times ran a story last Friday about a private \nconference of evangelical leaders in Washington, attended by Senator \nFrist and House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, whose name appears \nconstantly in this national debate. They had an audiotape of the \nconference. The story quotes two of the organizers of yesterday's rally \nin Kentucky, talking about working with congressional Republicans on \nplans to get rid of the Federal courts they don't like. This is a quote \nfrom Tony Perkins, one of the lead spokesmen yesterday for the Family \nResearch Council. He said this at this Washington, DC, conference with \nTom DeLay and Bill Frist:\n\n       There's more than one way to skin a cat, and there's more \n     than one way to take a black robe off the bench.\n\n  According to the Times article:\n\n       Mr. Perkins said he had attended a meeting with \n     congressional leaders a week earlier where the strategy of \n     stripping funding from certain courts was ``prominently'' \n     discussed. ``What they're thinking of is not only the fact of \n     just making these courts go away and recreating them the next \n     day, but also defunding them,'' Mr. Perkins said.\n\n  The story reports Mr. Dobson, a reverend also involved with this \neffort, as saying:\n\n       Very few people know this, that the Congress can simply \n     disenfranchise a court. They don't have to fire anybody or \n     impeach them or go through that battle. All they have to say \n     is the Ninth Circuit doesn't exist anymore, and it is gone.\n\n  Mr. Perkins said these plans to remake America's courts are ``on the \nradar screen, especially of conservatives here in Congress.''\n  We have valued, since the creation of this great Nation, our \nindependent and balanced judiciary. I am certain that members of the \njudiciary are angered at times with positions taken and things said by \nthose in the executive and legislative branches. It works both ways. \nYet we understand the nature of our checks and balances, the nature of \nthree separate branches of government is unique to America and has \ngiven us the strength to survive in this democracy for over 200 years.\n  The strategy of Tom DeLay, Senator Frist, and groups like the Family \nResearch Council challenge this premise of our constitutional \ndemocracy. I would like to address the questions raised about what \nmight happen if the Republicans go forward with the so-called nuclear \noption. First, let me tell you that the phrase ``nuclear option'' was \nnot conceived by a group of Democrats in a back room. As I understand \nit, Senator Trent Lott, a leading Republican, called this approach a \nnuclear option, understanding, as he did, that it is an assault on some \nof the most fundamental principles of the Constitution and the Senate. \nIt was, in fact, nuclear war and the use of a nuclear weapon from a \nprocedural point of view. It assaulted one of the most basic principles \nof America, the principle of checks and balances.\n  Look at the political landscape in America today. Republicans control\n\n[[Page S4174]]\n\nthe White House, the House, the Senate, and the Supreme Court. Not in \n60 years has so much power been vested in one party. But from the point \nof view of many of their special interest groups, it is not enough; \nthey want more. They don't just want to govern in America; they want to \nrule. That means they need and want powers beyond those given to a \npolitical party under our Constitution.\n  Think about why we have a Senate. It was part of the Great \nCompromise. Thirteen colonies came together, deciding whether they \ncould work together as one government, and the smaller colonies said we \ndon't have a chance. If you count numbers, the more populous colonies \nwill always win the debate. So the Great Compromise said the House of \nRepresentatives will have more people, with more representatives in the \nmore populous States, so they will have more votes. But the Senate is \ndifferent. Every State gets two Senators. The rules of the Senate were \nwritten so, even within the Senate, when one Senator objected to a \nmajor change in law, the Senate rules respected that minority Senator. \nIn fact, it wasn't until right after World War I that there was a way \nto even stop what was known as a filibuster. If you saw ``Mr. Smith \nGoes to Washington,'' you saw Jimmy Stewart, that new idealistic \nSenator, take to the floor arguing for something he believed in until \nhe ran out of breath and collapsed. Well, that is the filibuster. The \nway you can stop it is with a certain number of votes. Beginning in the \n20th century, that number of votes is 60. It recognizes that this \nunique Chamber in America's Government will always recognize the rights \nof the minority.\n  We have built on that principle, and that is why the filibuster was \ncreated. Sadly, the Republican majority today wants to break the rules \nof the Senate and change the filibuster rule. They want to end the \nchecks and balances that have been part of this institution since the \nConstitution was written. For what? So President Bush can have every \njudicial nominee he proposes to Congress, without debate, without \ndissention, and it would not be subject to a filibuster.\n\n  I think the filibuster is one of the most basic tenets of our checks-\nand-balances system. It prevents a tyranny of the majority and \nencourages compromise and moderation. Think about it; if it takes 60 \nvotes, you need to compromise. If it takes 60 votes, neither side has \nthat, so you need bipartisanship. It works every single day on \nlegislation and on nominees.\n  What about the President's track record when it comes to judges? \nConsider this: Since President Bush came to office, he sent 215 names \nof judicial nominees to the floor of the Senate; 205 have been \napproved. Only 10 have not been approved. More than 95 percent of the \nPresident's nominees have been approved by the Senate but, sadly, the \npoint of view of the White House is that it is not enough. They want \nthem all. They are willing to assault the Constitution and change the \nSenate rules. With an approval rate of 95 percent, this is not a \ncrisis; it is a manufactured political crisis.\n  Republicans claim it is unconstitutional to filibuster. They are \nwrong. The Constitution makes it clear that the rules of the Senate are \nthe decision of the Senate. Here is what article I, section 5 of the \nConstitution specifically states:\n\n       Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings. . . \n     .\n\n  That means the House and the Senate may determine the rules of its \nproceedings. From the beginning, the Senate has allowed filibusters. In \n1789, the first Senate filibustered a bill about moving the capitol \nfrom New York City to Washington. But these Republicans, under \nPresident Bush and Vice President Cheney, want to change that time-\nhonored rule. They claim the use of the filibuster to block judicial \nnominees has never happened, that it is unprecedented. That is what you \nhear from them. They are wrong.\n  Before George W. Bush became President, 11 judicial nominations \nneeded 60 or more votes--cloture--to end a filibuster.\n  On two other judicial nominations--one in 1986 and one in 1994--\ncloture was filed in order to end filibusters, but it was later \nwithdrawn. Of those 11 nominations on which cloture was needed to end a \nfilibuster, 4 occurred during the Clinton administration.\n  Let me just point to one. March 8, 2000, the nomination of Richard \nPaez to be a judge of the Ninth Circuit. Fourteen Republican Senators \nvoted on the Senate floor to filibuster Judge Paez's nomination. Look \nat the list of the 14 Senators, and do you know what name you will \nfind? Senator Bill Frist. He is now the majority leader, and he claims \nthis never happened in the history of the Senate. He, in fact, voted on \nthe floor of the Senate for a filibuster against Richard Paez, a \nClinton nominee to the Ninth Circuit. For the record, it was vote No. \n37, 106th Congress, second session, March 8, 2000.\n  In addition to the 4 Clinton judicial nominees who were filibustered, \n60 additional Clinton nominees never received a hearing. It was a \npocket filibuster. What is unprecedented is what Republicans are \nthreatening now, to fundamentally change the rules and traditions of \nthe Senate and the constitutional principle of checks and balances. To \nargue that no judicial nominee will ever need more than 51 votes--7 \ntimes since 1949, the Senate has faced this question: Can a simple \nmajority change the cloture rule? Every single time, the answer has \nbeen no, whether it was Democrats in the majority or Republicans in the \nmajority.\n  In 1953, Minority Leader Lyndon Johnson, the ``master of the \nSenate,'' as he was dubbed, a man who knew something about finding and \nusing power wherever he could legitimately find it, worked with \nMajority Leader Taft to protect the Senate from the nuclear option of \nhis day, when a single Democratic Senator threatened to use it.\n  Time and again, there have been threats to change this filibuster, \nand it has never happened. There has been ample opportunity to do that.\n  One Senator who was involved in that was Senator Fritz Mondale of \nMinnesota. He led a 1975 effort to change the cloture rule. Twenty-\nseven years later, in September 2002, an older and wiser Fritz Mondale \ncame back to the Senate to talk about his years as part of the Leader's \nLecture Series.\n  He admitted he made a mistake to try to push through a nuclear \noption. I want to read part of what he said. This is what Fritz Mondale \nsaid on reflection:\n\n       When I came to the Senate, I thought a simple majority \n     should be enough to end debate. I had seen the cloture rule \n     abused in the past, especially on civil rights. The old rules \n     permitted virtually endless talk. In recent years, many \n     Senators had developed a postcloture strategy where, even \n     after a successful cloture vote, they could still carry on \n     forever, reading and amending the Journal, reading and \n     amending the Chaplain's prayer--as we did for several days--\n     filing hundreds of amendments with no end in sight.\n\n  Listen to what Fritz Mondale said:\n\n       It had to be changed, and it was, to what is now called the \n     Byrd rule. But to end a filibuster still requires 60 votes, \n     and I believe that is about right.\n       It is a balancing act. You need to be able to close off \n     debate, but you also need to give an individual Senator the \n     power to stop everything in the country and to rip open an \n     issue in a way that no other institution in America can. It \n     can't happen in the House. Their rules of debate are very \n     different. It can't happen in news conferences. It can't \n     happen on talk shows. That is entertainment, not debate. Only \n     the Senate can stop the Nation in its tracks, and it is the \n     only body in the world that allows it.\n\n  To claim, as nuclear option supporters do, that the 1975 effort \nproves the constitutionality of their plan is simply wrong. It is a \nmisrepresentation of the facts. They argue we are simply talking about \njudicial nominees. Yet we know from a Congressional Research Service \nanalysis of this issue that if they went forward with the nuclear \noption on judicial nominees, nominees who are being appointed to the \nbench for a lifetime, more could follow from that.\n  I still hope we can avoid this constitutional confrontation, this \ncrisis. I hope the destruction that will be brought to the Senate can \nbe avoided. I hope we can have a positive view toward the Senate's \nfuture. But let me say this: If the Republican majority in the Senate \nexercises the nuclear option, breaks the rules of the Senate for the \nfirst time to change the rules, to eliminate the filibuster on judicial \nnominees, to attack the principle of checks and balances, the \nconstitutional principle of our Government, then I think the response \nfrom the Democratic side can easily be described as\n\n[[Page S4175]]\n\nthis: If the Republicans are going to break the rules, the Democrats \nare going to play by the rules. Let me tell you what I mean.\n  We believe we must defend the Senate and the Constitution. We will \nnot allow one party to eliminate an essential part of checks and \nbalances. The Senate operates according to customs. The minority party \ndefers to the majority party regarding what bills come to the floor, \nand other questions. It is a system that requires trust and cooperation \nevery day.\n  If Republicans choose to use the nuclear option, they are choosing to \nassault that trust and cooperation. We can no longer routinely give our \nunanimous consent to whatever procedural request the majority leader \nmakes. Instead, we will use the existing rules and precedents to have \nthe Senate focus on the real crises facing America's families and \nbusinesses. Instead of granting deference to the Republican majority to \nset the agenda on the Senate floor, Democrats will use the existing \nrules and the precedents of the Senate to focus on issues such as \nhealth care, energy, education, minimum wage, making certain we take \ncare of our veterans and soldiers.\n  We have already placed a number of important bills on the Senate \ncalendar, any of which can be brought up at once if the Republicans \ntrigger the nuclear option. These bills address real priorities and \nchallenges we face: funding our schools, bringing down the price of \ngasoline at the pump, finding a way to provide health insurance and \nhealth care for Americans, veterans benefits, and imposing fiscal \ndiscipline with Government spending.\n  Let me make it clear. We are not going to set out to close down the \nSenate or to close down the Government. Senator Reid, our Democratic \nleader, and all the Members of the Senate feel as I do, that shutting \ndown the Government was the hapless tactic of the Gingrich revolution. \nIt was a terrible idea. Rush Limbaugh was the only American applauding \nit every day, but the American people knew better. They want our \nGovernment to continue. They want Government services that are \nessential not to be in danger. So we are prepared to use the Senate \nrules to make certain that the defense of our Nation and the defense of \nour Armed Forces will be paramount, that passing key appropriations \nbills will occur, the Government will go about its business.\n  But when it comes to the rest of the debate in the Senate, when it \ncomes to the agenda of legislative issues, we believe we can and will \nuse the rules, if the nuclear option is exercised, to make certain that \nthis debate is broadened--broadened beyond the special interest \ndebates of K Street, the lobbyists who sit around the corridors out \nhere begging for their bills to be called. We will expand this to \ninclude a debate over issues American families are begging us to \nconsider, such as the cost of health insurance, help in putting \nchildren through college, finding a way for us to deal with the energy \ncrisis in a responsible way that will conserve energy and bring about \nmore fuel efficiency, in addition to environmentally responsible \nexploration for new energy sources.\n\n  Let's talk about gasoline for a minute. Americans are paying nearly \n50 cents a gallon more for gas today than they were a year ago. Gas \nprices have surged an average of 19 cents per gallon in the last 3 \nweeks. What is the Republican solution? Many times it is more of the \nsame. Keep increasing America's dependence on increasingly expensive \noil from increasingly volatile parts of the world.\n  If Republicans are insisting on changing the rules of the Senate, \nDemocrats will use the opportunity to press for an end to price gouging \nat the pumps today. We will also push for real long-term solutions, \nincluding conservation and new sources of alternative energy that will \nmake America more secure in the future.\n  Think of it, 45 million Americans in our country, 1 in 7 have no \nhealth insurance. Tens of thousands more are underinsured. Rising \nhealth costs are eating up every penny of the profits at many \ncompanies. Did you read the report in the paper in the business section \nlast week? General Motors lost $1 billion in the last quarter. When \nthey were asked why they were losing money if they were still selling \ncars, they said: With every car we sell is $1,500 in health insurance \ncosts and $500 in pension costs. So before we can compete with the \nforeign manufacturers, we have to pay for the health insurance and the \npension costs.\n  What we are saying is this ought to be part of a national debate. \nThere has not been a single suggestion on the floor of the Senate from \nthe Republican leadership that they are ready to even discuss health \ncare, nor from the White House.\n  If we move beyond the nuclear option, we on the Democratic side feel \nthis debate has to take place, and we will move proactively to put this \non the calendar for debate during this session of the Senate.\n  In recent months, we found the new prescription drug benefit under \nMedicare will cost hundreds of billions of dollars more than first \nestimated. Now this week a new report warns the drug benefit will not \nprovide adequate coverage for seniors with cancer and other chronic \nillnesses, and leave them with huge personal prescription drug bills. \nIf the Republicans in the Senate use the nuclear option to try to \nchange the rules of the Senate, Democrats will use whatever rules we \ncan, whatever leverage we can find to fix the Medicare prescription \ndrug bill.\n  Millions of young people across America are going to graduate from \nhigh school next month. Many are off applying to colleges, fingers \ncrossed they will get into that great school. But there is a fear in \nevery family--at least in most families--that some of the sons and \ndaughters who are accepted at the best schools will not be able to go \nbecause the families cannot afford it. If the Republicans insist on \nusing the nuclear option, the Democrats will push to bring to the floor \nSenate measures to make college more affordable for families across \nAmerica.\n  We will look for ways to bring to the floor a bill to fund properly \nVA health facilities and end the deficits that are forcing Americans \nall across America to wait months to see a doctor.\n  We do not have to manufacture crises. There are real, urgent problems \nwith which this Senate ought to be dealing. If the Republicans are \ninterested in governing, they will join the Democrats in addressing \nthese issues. If they are more concerned about political gains, they \nwill object. Democrats will not break the rules and we will not stand \nby idly if others try to destroy the rules of the Senate for temporary \npolitical advantage. We will use the rules, we will live by the rules, \nwe will follow the rules at every opportunity to protect the \nConstitution and do the people's business.\n  Senators can expect if the nuclear option is called and passes we \nwill spend more time at our desks, more time in session, more time on \nthe floor, more time in Washington. The old complaint about 1,000-page \nbills coming to the Senate never having been read, they will be read. \nThe complaint that amendments come to the floor Senators have not had a \nchance to read, they will be read. The complaint about speaking to an \nempty Chamber with few Senators around, that may change. There will be \nSenators on the floor, part of a debate over amendments that are \nimportant to this country.\n  I sincerely hope the Republican majority will think twice. Senator \nMcCain said, and I think rightly, you never know what the next election \nmight bring. You might find yourself in a minority status, and it is \nimportant for us to understand that as Senators have come and gone, \nalmost 1,900 now in the history of the United States, as issues have \ncome and gone, as Congresses have come and gone, the traditions and \nrules of the Senate have endured. The Constitution which guides this \nChamber, which brings us to the floor today and every day, the \nConstitution we have all sworn to uphold and defend is worth fighting \nfor.\n  When a White House with any President of either party tries to extend \ntheir power at the expense of the Constitution, historically the Senate \nhas said no.\n  This time, unfortunately, this President is demanding more power than \nany President in the history of the United States when it comes to \njudicial nominees. This President is demanding powers that have never \nbeen exercised under this Constitution. Sadly, his party, the proud \nRepublican Party, is not willing to say no. They should. In the past, \nFranklin Roosevelt's Democratic Party said no to him when he\n\n[[Page S4176]]\n\noverextended. Thomas Jefferson's party said no to him when he tried to \nextend his Presidential power. They understood that the Constitution is \nmore important than the power of any President.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, right now, the regular order is the motion \nto proceed to the highway bill. It is one of the most significant bills \nwe will be addressing this year. It is one that we are very hopeful \nwill pass. Last year, the highway bill passed with a vote of 76 to 21. \nHaving received that very strong majority, we believe that this bill is \nso much like it that we should be able to do the same thing.\n  I understand that tomorrow morning at 11:45 there will be a vote. \nAgain, as I have said since 2 this afternoon, I encourage Members to \ncome to the floor to be heard on the motion to proceed to the highway \nbill, and I am hoping that will happen. I will only make a couple of \ncomments.\n  I do not want to sound redundant, but I will respond to the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois. A couple of hours ago I commented \nthat the people from Oklahoma maybe are different from the rest of the \ncountry. When I go down the street, people are concerned about the \ndecisions of the U.S. Supreme Court. They are concerned about liberal \njudges legislating from the bench, and this President has been \nconcerned about that. I am talking about things like school prayer, gay \nmarriages, and ``one nation under God'' in the Pledge of Allegiance. \nThese things are very important. These things are probably important to \npeople all over the country.\n  It can be talked about hour after hour. Threats can be made about \nwhat one would do, but it is not a nuclear option, it is a \nconstitutional option. This has been true for 214 years now, where \nthere has not been a filibustering of circuit court judges. This is \nsomething that should not require a supermajority of 60 votes. If there \nis one thing my people in Oklahoma want changed, it is to be able to \nselect judges who will interpret the Constitution and not use the bench \nfor legislation purposes.\n  As far as the Energy bill is concerned, I do agree with the Senator \nfrom Illinois that we need to do something about our dependence on \nforeign oils for our energy supply. It is going to be absolutely \nnecessary to have this Energy bill, and I believe we will have it. We \nneed to address drilling. We need to do something about fossil fuels. \nWe need to do something about nuclear and renewables. Just one example: \nIn the House bill that was passed, there is a tax provision that will \nencourage people to go after marginal production. My State of Oklahoma \nhappens to be a very large marginal producer. For those who are not \nfamiliar with this, a marginal well produces 15 barrels or fewer a day. \nWe have the largest number of marginal wells in our State of Oklahoma. \nIf we had every marginal well producing today that has been shut down \nor plugged up in the last 10 years, it would be more than we are \ncurrently importing from Saudi Arabia. These are little things that can \nbe in an energy bill.\n  The President was misquoted on the Senate floor a few minutes ago, \nbut certainly everyone realizes it is just a supply and demand issue. \nIf we are able to produce more here, it is going to be cheaper. That is \nwhat we need to do. Those individuals who are somehow living in this \nmythical world that we can run the greatest machine in the history of \nthe world on windmills are wrong. By the way, speaking of windmills, I \nfind even some of the environmentalist extremists now do not want \nwindmills because they are killing the birds. We have to realize we \nhave the most powerful, largest machine ever in the history of the \nworld, and we need to have an energy bill to run that machine.\n\n\n                  china's threat to national security\n\n  Mr. President, over the past 3 weeks I have given three speeches \ncalling our attention to the rising threat that China is becoming to \nour national security. Today I will highlight the areas that most \ndirectly affect our national security: weapons proliferation and \nmilitary modernization. These two aspects are interrelated and add an \nalarming dynamic to our complex relationship with China.\n  It is a difficult situation, one in which information is our best \nresource. Five years ago, Congress created the bipartisan U.S.-China \nCommission to study the significance of recent events and the impact \nthese events have on our national security. The Commission has held \nhearings and enlisted the services of experts across the world to gain \nclarity about what is happening with China. The conclusions are \ncompiled in the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission's \n2004 report to Congress, a document that reveals an alarming picture of \nwhere we are heading.\n  China has made commitments to stop proliferating illegal technology \nover and over since 1992. However, its actual practice has been \nmarkedly different. Just this past January, the Bush administration \nsanctioned eight Chinese companies for aiding Iran's missile \ndevelopment. Two of these companies, China Great Wall Industry \nCorporation and China North Industry Corporation, have been repeatedly \nsanctioned for over a decade. Another penalized company, China Aero-\nTechnology Import and Export Corporation, is suspected of transferring \ntechnology from McDonnell-Douglas to China's military. The fact is that \nChina has been unable to control its own companies. According to State \nDepartment testimony, China has a ``serial proliferation problem,'' and \nwhile the official line is to crack down on the weapons trade, \n``reality has been quite different.''\n  Over recent years, these transfers have become even more problematic, \nas the Commission details in its report:\n\n     . . . Chinese transfers have evolved from sales of complete \n     missile systems, to exports of largely dual-use nuclear, \n     chemical, and missile components and technologies . . . \n     Recent activities ``have aggravated trends that result in \n     ambiguous technical aid, more indigenous capabilities, longer \n     range missiles, and secondary proliferation.'' Continuing \n     intelligence reports indicate that Chinese cooperation with \n     Pakistan and Iran remains an integral element of China's \n     foreign policy . . . Beijing's failure to control such \n     transfers gives the appearance that these are allowed in \n     accordance with an unstated national policy. China has \n     generally tried to avoid making fundamental changes in its \n     transfer policies by offering the United States carefully \n     worded commitments or exploiting differences between \n     agreements.\n\n  In mid-2003, the CIA reported to Congress that ``firms in China \nprovided dual-use missile-related items, raw materials, and/or \nassistance to . . . countries of proliferation concern such as Iran, \nLibya, and North Korea.'' With these recently sanctioned companies, we \nsee that China is fully willing to proliferate regardless of the \nconsequences. Why? Well, perhaps we need to consider that something \nelse is going on here besides profits.\n  China seems to proliferate with countries that have been terrorist \nsponsors, countries such as Iran, Iraq and Libya. These countries in \nturn offer China something they desperately need: oil. In my last \nspeech I discussed China's search for oil sources and the implications \nthis has on economic and national security. But the connection here is \nbeyond energy. The Commission report describes what it looks like:\n\n       This need for energy security may help explain Beijing's \n     history of assistance to terrorist-sponsoring states, with \n     various forms of WMD-related items and technical assistance, \n     even in the face of U.S. sanctions . . . But, this pursuit of \n     oil diplomacy may support objectives beyond just energy \n     supply. Beijing's bilateral arrangements with oil-rich Middle \n     Eastern states also helped create diplomatic and strategic \n     alliances with countries that were hostile to the United \n     States. For example, with U.S. interests precluded from \n     entering Iran, China may hope to achieve a long-term \n     competitive advantage relative to the United States. Over \n     time, Beijing's relationship-building may counter U.S. power \n     and enhance Beijing's ability to influence political and \n     military outcomes. One of Beijing's stated goals is to reduce \n     what it considers U.S. superpower dominance in favor of a \n     multipolar global power structure in which China attains \n     superpower status on par with the United States.\n\n  I cannot say it stronger than that. China is exploiting our timidity. \nThe Commission recommends that we pressure the administration to \ndevelop and\n\n[[Page S4177]]\n\npublish a coordinated, comprehensive strategy. I think that is very \nsound advice and I will be introducing a resolution shortly to that \neffect.\n  Another major area of concern is China's military modernization. The \nweapons China is investing in include cruise missiles, amphibious \nassault ships, submarines, long-range target acquisition systems, and \nadvanced SU-30 and SU-31 fighter aircraft it has been purchasing from \nRussia.\n\n  I have always been very proud of GEN John Jumper, who had the courage \nback in 1998 to stand up publicly to say right now we have other \ncountries that are producing better equipment than we have, such as our \nstrike vehicles. The very best we have is the F-15 and F-16. The SU-\n30s, according to General Jumper, are in many ways superior to ones we \nmake in this country. We have to correct that situation and we are \ngoing to with the advent of the FA-22 and joint strike fighters that \nwill be coming on line, but in the meantime China is buying these \nvehicles. We have always known they have a nuclear capability, but what \nis more concerning now is they have developed a conventional capability \nthat is equal to or greater than ours in many respects.\n  The commission believes that this force is being shaped to fit a \nTaiwan conflict scenario:\n\n       [China's] military advancements have resulted in a dramatic \n     shift in the cross-Strait balance toward China, with serious \n     implications for Taiwan, for the United States, and for \n     cross-Strait relations.\n\n  The commission states that there are two ways we can prevent a \nmilitary escalation over Taiwan. The first is to pressure the EU to \nmaintain its arms embargo on China. This is a group of bipartisan \nexperts saying this. Second, we should have harsher punishments for \ncontractors who sell sensitive technology to China. We need a \ncomprehensive annual report on who is selling what to China because, \nquite frankly, right now we simply don't know exactly how deep this \nproblem goes.\n  Opting to ignore the situation with China is not a choice that we as \nrepresentatives of the American people can afford to make. I urge this \nbody to listen closely to the commission's conclusion:\n\n       We need to use our substantial leverage to develop an \n     architecture that will help avoid conflict, attempt to build \n     cooperative practices and institutions, and advance both \n     countries' long-term interests. The United States has the \n     leverage now and perhaps for the next decade, but this may \n     not always be the case . . . If we falter in the use of our \n     economic and political influence now to effect positive \n     change in China, we will have squandered an historic \n     opportunity . . . China will likely not initiate the decisive \n     measures toward more meaningful economic and political reform \n     without substantial, sustained, and increased pressure from \n     the United States.\n\n  In the resolution I introduce, I will be asking you to stand behind \nthe US-China Commission's recommendations. These recommendations are \nlisted in the Commission's 2004 Report to Congress. I have highlighted \na few of these in my recent speeches, but there are many more. We need \nto send a message of urgency to the administration to adopt what our \nown commission recommends. This is not a partisan move. This is a real \nand legitimate need to respond to the facts before us. We have a clear \npicture of where the trends are heading--economically, militarily and \nin ideology--and the security of the United States demands our \nresponse.\n  In my last speech that will accompany the resolution I will be \nintroducing, I will summarize all the recommendations from the \ncommission. I hope it will be the first--but not final--step in the \ndevelopment of a more proactive and comprehensive policy toward China. \nIt needs to be a policy that adequately addresses our national \nsecurity, especially the proliferation of military technology. It also \nneeds to address free trade, human rights and, of course, Taiwan. I \nfear the track we are on does not adequately address any of these.\n  This is very distressing. In some of the previous talks we quoted \nsome of the Chinese colonels when they said we can do this to America, \nwe can compete not only militarily but economically. This is something \nwe have to be concerned about. I cannot think of anything that would be \nmore important to address from a national security objective than that.\n  However, there is something that is most important to address right \nnow and that is the subject we are on, which is the reauthorization of \nthe highway bill.\n  I will make a couple of comments about that. I know there are some \nother people who want to come down. I will yield to them at that time. \nBut when you look at the way the Senate has historically approached the \nreauthorization of the highway bill, it is different than has been done \non the other side. It is the more difficult way because there are so \nmany things that are in a formula. Formulas address problems in low-\nincome States, in low-population States, in low-population density \nStates, in States with high fatality rates, with guaranteed minimum \ngrowth and guaranteed minimum rate of return from donor States. We have \ndonee States. All of these things are part of a very complex formula.\n  We will tomorrow be talking about this for an hour, from 10:45 to \n11:45. There will be 1 hour equally divided between both sides. I will \nbe controlling the time on this side. I hope at that time we have \nMembers come down who are concerned about this bill, who have problems \nwith this bill, so we can respond to those problems but, most \nimportantly, so we can have cloture on a motion to proceed and have a \nvote. That vote will take place at 11:45 tomorrow morning. I look \nforward to coming down and debating the merits of the highway bill.\n  The bill passed last year--and this is substantially the same as last \nyear's bill--passed this body by a margin of 76 to 21. I anticipate the \nsame thing will happen, but it will not happen until we get to the \nbill. We will not get on the bill until the cloture on the motion to \nproceed is voted on, which will be at 11:45 tomorrow morning.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about two \nArmy Reserve soldiers from Illinois I had the pleasure of meeting \nrecently: SPC Jeremy Church and LT Matthew Brown.\n  Both of these soldiers fought last year in a battle that remains the \nlargest enemy ambush of American troops in the war in Iraq. The battle \noccurred on Good Friday last year, April 9, 2004.\n  The 724th Transportation Company of Bartonville, IL, was taking part \nin a convoy escort operation delivering fuel to Baghdad International \nAirport when it was ambushed by insurgents. More than 150 enemy \nfighters poured heavy weapons fire onto the convoy.\n  Lieutenant Brown was the convoy commander. Specialist Church was his \ndriver. In the first minutes of the attack, Lieutenant Brown was \nwounded, losing his eye. Specialist Church remained calm, \nsimultaneously treating his wounded lieutenant, driving his damaged \nvehicle, and firing his rifle, one-handed, at the enemy.\n  Specialist Church drove to safety, dropped off the wounded Lieutenant \nBrown, rallied some assistance, and then drove back into danger, the \nkill zone, to help rescue, extract, his buddies who were still trapped \nunder fire. He loaded casualties onto a truck until it was full, then \nsent the wounded soldiers to safety while he remained behind to \ncontinue the fight, taking cover behind destroyed vehicles.\n  For his actions that day, Specialist Church was awarded the Silver \nStar, the third-highest honor the United States can offer for valor in \ncombat. He is the first and only U.S. Army Reserve soldier to win this \nmedal in this conflict. Lieutenant Brown was awarded the Bronze Star.\n\n[[Page S4178]]\n\n  In that same battle, PFC Gregory Goodrich was killed. SPC Keith \nMaupin was captured and remains missing in action.\n  Members of the National Guard and Reserve train on weekends and \nduring 2-week annual training periods to prepare for that day when \ntheir country might call upon them to step away from families and \ncivilian careers in order to fight America's wars.\n  These citizen-soldiers were ready to do that. The call came. They \nanswered it. Now they have borne the terrible burden of battle. Gregory \nGoodrich gave his life. Keith Maupin remains missing. Matthew Brown has \nlost an eye and, because of that, he will probably lose his job as a \nPeoria, IL, law enforcement officer. Jeremy Church risked life and limb \nto save others and to vigorously fight back the attackers. All of these \nmen exemplify the finest traditions of America's citizen-soldiers. We \nhonor their service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/25/senate-section/article/S4178-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4178-S4179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      APPROVAL OF COMMITTEE RULES\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, yesterday marked the 90th anniversary of \nthe beginning of the Armenian Genocide. A date of great significance \nfor many Rhode Islanders, and growing in significance for all \nAmericans, this day not only commemorates the atrocities of the past, \nbut also reminds us that it must not happen again. Remembering the \nvictims is our duty to the past and to the future.\n  The term ``genocide'' did not even exist when these atrocities \noccurred from 1915 to 1923, yet the numbers are staggering. Over 1.5 \nmillion people perished. Over 500,000 people were forcibly removed from \ntheir homes and their homeland. Armenian religious, political, and \nintellectual leaders were killed. Men were removed from their families \nand women and children were left vulnerable to deportation, kidnapping, \nand starvation, and 132,000 Armenian orphans became foster children in \nAmerican families.\n  It is vital for the distinct identity of every culture to be honored \nand celebrated. Over one and a half million Americans are of Armenian \nheritage, and on this day we are grateful for their many contributions \nto our country. Rhode Island and this entire Nation continue to benefit \nfrom a strong and vibrant Armenian community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/25/senate-section/article/S4179-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                           Medic Steven Sirko\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from Portage. \nSteven Sirko, 20 years old, died on April 17 while stationed in \nMaqdadiyah, Iraq. With his entire life before him, Steven risked \neverything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, \nin a land halfway around the world.\n  Recently married to another army medic, Steven turned down a chance \nto stay stateside with the Army's Special Forces in order to be in Iraq \nnear his wife. A football player in high school, Steven was remembered \nby friends and family as a tough, outgoing student. His father told a \nlocal newspaper, that his son was ``very strong, very outgoing, very \nrespectful. After 9/11, like so many young men, he wanted to fight \nterrorism.'' His stepbrother, who also served in the Army, called \nSteven, ``the light of any crowd.''\n  Steven was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. He served in the first battalion, 30th infantry regiment, \nthird brigade, and third infantry division. This brave young soldier \nleaves behind his wife, Virginia; his father, Rick Sirko; his mother, \nLinda Lipford; his stepmother, Rose Sirko; three sisters; one brother; \nand two stepbrothers;.\n  Today, I join Steven's family and friends in mourning his death. \nWhile we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take \npride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Steven, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Steven was known for his dedication to his family and his love of \ncountry. Today and always, Steven will be remembered by family members, \nfriends, and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero and we honor the \nsacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Steven's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of Steven's actions will live on far longer than any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Steven Sirko in the \nCongressional Record of the Senate for his service to this country and \nfor his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I \nthink about this just cause in which we are engaged, and the \nunfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that \nfamilies like Steven's can find comfort in the words of the prophet \nIsaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord \nGod will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Steven.\n\n\n                         Specialist Grant Croft\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to publicly recognize SPC \nGrant Croft of Sioux Falls, SD, for receiving the Army Commendation \nMedal.\n  Specialist Croft is serving in Mosul, Iraq, as a medic for the 2nd \nPlatoon, 194th Military Police Company based at Fort Campbell, KY. He \nis a talented and dedicated serviceman, who, according to his \nsuperiors, ``On a daily basis, sets the standard for what a soldier \nmedic should be. Specialists Croft's strength, stamina and moral \ncharacter are a constant source of strength for our platoon.''\n  On January 21, 2005, while training at the Udari Range in Iraq, prior \nto the platoon's arrival in Mosul, Specialist Croft earned the Army \nCommendation Medal for his performance following an Apache helicopter \ncrash. The Army's description of the event states: ``Without regard for \nhis own safety, Specialist Croft quickly moved to the crashed aircraft \nand immediately began the necessary medical treatment for [the pilots'] \nlife threatening injuries. He placed himself in harms way through the \nentire process. His selfless act and professional actions were those of \na highly skilled and dedicated medic.''\n  It is with great honor that I share Specialist Croft's tremendous \naccomplishments with my colleagues. He is a true patriot, and America \nis deeply grateful for his service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/25/senate-section/article/S4179-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4179-S4180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JOE BEYRLE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on Friday, April 22, a true American hero \nwas laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery. Joe Beyrle of \nMuskegon, MI, was a paratrooper in the 101st Division on D-Day in World \nWar II. His capture by the Germans and his heroic escape to fight with \nthe Russian Army on the Eastern Front, making him the only American \nsoldier to fight with both the United States and Russian armies against \nNazi Germany, have been chronicled in a wonderful book by retired Army \nColonel Thomas Taylor called The Simple Sounds of Freedom.\n  It was my privilege to speak at the burial ceremony for Joe Beyrle. I \nask unanimous consent that my remarks be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S4180]]\n\n                         Eulogy for Joe Beyrle\n\n       Arlington National Cemetery, April 22, 2005\n       We cannot be reminded often enough about the extraordinary \n     things that seemingly ordinary Americans have done to protect \n     our country and our freedoms.\n       A short year after Joe Beyrle graduated from Muskegon's \n     Saint Joseph High School in June of 1942, he found himself on \n     the way to England as an elite paratrooper in the storied \n     Screaming Eagles of the 101st Airborne Division. And that is \n     when Joe Beyrle, like other members of the Greatest \n     Generation, came face to face with unimaginable challenges, \n     and went from being seemingly ordinary to extraordinary.\n       I knew Joe and JoAnne, and I knew of Joe's wartime \n     exploits, long before Tom Taylor's wonderful book about Joe \n     was published. What makes that book so special for me is that \n     now everyone can be inspired by the amazing story of Joe's \n     service during World War II: the rigorous training that made \n     ``Jumpin' Joe'' such an expert paratrooper that he was \n     selected for clandestine drops in occupied France before D-\n     Day to supply the French resistance with gold; his dogged \n     determination after his capture on D-Day by the Germans to \n     escape and rejoin his unit; his courageous decision to fight \n     with the Russian Army after he finally escaped the German POW \n     camp--even helping to liberate the very POW camp from which \n     he had escaped--making him the only American soldier to fight \n     for both the United States and the Russians against Nazi \n     Germany; and the remarkable story of his travel after he was \n     wounded to the American Embassy in Moscow, where American \n     officials at first thought he was a spy because his dog tags \n     had been found on a dead soldier thought to be him two years \n     earlier.\n       And of course who can forget the story of Joe marrying \n     JoAnne in September, 1946--in a ceremony conducted by the \n     same priest who had conducted a funeral mass for the presumed \n     killed-in-action Joe Beyrle a few years before.\n       And what a memorable moment it was in 1994 when President \n     Clinton and President Yeltsin honored Joe simultaneously in \n     the White House Rose Garden as part of the celebration of the \n     50th anniversary of D-Day.\n       Joe's indomitable spirit, love of country and will to \n     survive come through every page of his remarkable story, a \n     story that reads more like fiction than history. One of my \n     favorite examples of the legendary Beyrle tenacity--Joe would \n     probably call it bull-headedness--took place at the end of \n     the story when Joe was being held in custody in Moscow until \n     the American Embassy officials could establish his true \n     identity.\n       In a feverish and woozy state from his wounds, Joe decided \n     to overpower the Marine guarding his room and escape again--\n     to rejoin the Russian Army and get home by way of Berlin! \n     Even Joe admitted: ``Of all my escape plans, this was the \n     wildest and dumbest of all!''\n       It is said that courage isn't the absence of fear but the \n     presence of faith. Joe was a man of courage because he had \n     such a vast reservoir of faith--faith in himself; faith in \n     the cause that his country asked him to fight for; and faith \n     in his Creator.\n       Shortly after Tom Taylor's book about Joe was published, I \n     hosted a reception for Joe and his family and Tom Taylor in \n     the hearing room of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The \n     Secretary of the Army, the Army Vice Chief of Staff, and the \n     Russian Ambassador attended out of respect for Joe. Joe was \n     in his element that day, passing out Screaming Eagle lapel \n     pins and replicas of the paratrooper's crickets used by the \n     Screaming Eagles on D-Day to identify one another behind \n     enemy lines. I still have the one he gave me. Listen.\n       When I referred to Joe Beyrle at the reception as a hero, \n     Joe said that ``the real heroes are buried in Europe.'' There \n     are indeed a lot of American heroes buried in Europe. But \n     surely some of America's greatest heroes are here at \n     Arlington, visited each day by a hushed and awestruck \n     multitude of their grateful fellow citizens whose freedom was \n     defended by their sacrifices.\n       There is no more hallowed ground than where we stand today. \n     And there is no hero more deserving of resting here than Joe \n     Beyrle. Let us all honor Joe by resolving in this sacred \n     place to live by his example of selfless service. The highest \n     tribute we can pay to this extraordinary American is to make \n     sure that the Simple Sounds of Freedom always resonate in \n     this great country that he loved so much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/25/senate-section/article/S4180-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                HONORING THE INDIANA SPORTS CORPORATION\n\n Mr. LUGAR.

Mr. President, I honor Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, \nwho is a key leader in the civil rights movement and continues to be a \nguiding light in his community. I am honored that Reverend \nShuttlesworth is visiting Missouri on April 29, and I want to \ncommemorate his visit by briefly sharing some of his accomplishments.\n  Reverend Shuttlesworth grew up in Birmingham, AL, and graduated from \nAlabama State University in 1951. After graduating, he continued to do \ngraduate work at Alabama State and then received seminary training at \nCedar Grove Academy and Selma University. His involvement in civil \nrights has been grounded in his belief that ``a man should not be \njudged by the color of his skin any more than he is judged by the color \nof his eyes.''\n  In 1953, at the age of 30, Reverend Shuttlesworth became pastor of \nthe Bethel Baptist Church in Birmingham, during the period of time when \nthe city earned the nickname ``Bombingham'' for the black homes that \nwere bombed by white supremacists. In May 1956, Reverend Shuttlesworth \nhelped lead a group of ministers to establish the Alabama Christian \nMovement for Human Rights, in response to the NAACP being outlawed in \nAlabama.\n  Reverend Shuttlesworth, on many occasions, nearly became a martyr of \nthe Civil Rights Movement. On Christmas Day 1956, as Reverend \nShuttlesworth prepared to lead protests against the segregation of \nBirmingham's buses, someone threw a bomb under his bed in the parsonage \nof his church, where he was talking to a visiting deacon. Miraculously, \nhe was unharmed.\n  Undeterred, in 1957 Reverend Shuttlesworth joined with Dr. Martin \nLuther King, Reverend Ralph David Abernathy and Bayard Rustin to form \nthe Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which was firmly \ncommitted to using nonviolence to advocate for Civil Rights despite the \nviolence that was being committed against its members. He would later \nhelp to organize sit-ins against segregated lunch counters and was a \nkey leader of the mass protests and demonstrations in Birmingham during \nthe spring of 1963. During those tumultuous times, Reverend \nShuttlesworth was also assaulted by police dogs, knocked unconscious by \na fire hose, and jailed more than 35 times.\n  Reverend Shuttlesworth moved to Cincinnati, where he founded the \nGreater New Light Baptist Church in 1966, and today he continues to \nserve as Pastor. In 1988, Reverend Shuttlesworth established the \nShuttlesworth Housing Foundation to help needy families access capital \nfor down payments for the purchase of homes. His efforts have helped \nhundreds of low-income families in the Cincinnati area to become \nhomeowners.\n  These are just a portion of the good works that this outstanding \nservant of God has done to help make our Nation more just. I commend \nReverend Shuttlesworth for his outstanding contributions to the cause \nof civil rights for all Americans. I am honored to share his story with \nmy colleagues, and I wish him and his family all the best for the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/25/senate-section/article/S4181-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               STATE REPRESENTATIVE CHARLES W.

Mr. President, I today honor a great American, a \ngreat Coloradan, and a great Puebloan.\n  Alcario Vigil was born and raised in the San Luis Valley in Colorado \nand on April 1st turned 100 years old. His life has been rich with \naccomplishments and extraordinary devotion to his family, his friends, \nand his community.\n  Known as ``Cowboy,'' Alcario Vigil grew up in Lobatos, CO, just down \nthe road from the Salazar family ranch in the San Luis Valley. Like \nmost of his neighbors, he was brought up in a poor family and \neventually took over responsibility for his parents' ranch with his \nwife Sophia. Together, the Vigil family survived the hardships of the \nGreat Depression and raised eight children on the Lobatos family ranch, \nwhere they prospered and strengthened Colorado and this country.\n  Throughout his life, Alcario has been respected as an outstanding \ncommunity servant, a devoted husband, and a loving father. He has a \nremarkable record serving as a Penitente for more than 70 years. He has \npassed those values to his descendents, some of whom are now seventh-\ngeneration Coloradans.\n  Although ``Cowboy'' lost his devoted wife Sofia in 1994, and his son \nJose just 2 years ago, Alcario remains strong and healthy in his Pueblo \nhome. Even at 100 years, he works the ranch's irrigation ditches in the \nsummer months and enjoys visits from his family and friends.\n  The Pueblo County Commission recently declared April 1, 2005, to be \n``Alcario (Cowboy) Vigil Day.''

Its 35-year record of advocacy and \nleadership in fully meeting the goals of the Clean Water Act has helped \nguarantee the chemical, biological and physical health of our Nation's \nrivers, lakes, streams, bays, and coasts.\n  NACWA's members serve the majority of the sewered population in the \ncountry and treat and reclaim over 18 billion gallons of wastewater a \nday. Simply stated, NACWA and its members deserve to be celebrated for \ntheir ongoing role in the remarkable revitalization of America's \nwaterways.\n  Despite the improvements made so far to the Nation's waters, the \nSenate Environment and Public Works Committee and NACWA understand that \nsignificant work remains to be done to achieve the lofty goals of the \nClean Water Act. From the committee's close working relationship with \nthe association, we know NACWA is well-positioned to continue to build \non this Nation's water quality gains.\n  The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee has looked to AMSA \nand will continue to look to NACWA as a valued informational resource. \nThe association has always been willing to share its expertise and to \nprovide leadership in challenging times. For example, in the wake of \nthe attacks on September 11, 2001, the association responded \nimmediately with creative ideas and vital leadership in developing \ntools and resources to help further secure the Nation's critical water \ninfrastructure. In fact, the association has been a vital resource on a \nhost of clean water issues from wet weather control and the critical \nneed for a Federal-State-local partnership to meet the Nation's clean \nwater challenges.\n  As chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I have \nworked closely with the association and know that NACWA will build on \nits tradition as a trusted resource for Congress and the U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. I am also confident that NACWA will \nmeet its strategic objectives and the goals of AMSA's original \nfounders. Most importantly, NACWA's success is a direct result of its \nunparalleled membership. NACWA, then AMSA, was established in 1970 by \nrepresentatives of 22 municipal wastewater treatment agencies. Since \nthen, AMSA has grown into an organization of nearly 300 municipal \nagency members, including Oklahoma City, Stillwater and Tulsa, and a \ntotal membership of nearly 400 organizations poised to ensure that the \n21st century will enjoy continued water quality progress.\n  The association's public agency members not only represent what is \nbest about public service, they exemplify what it means to be \nenvironmental practitioners. Their daily work enables us to enjoy our \nNation's rivers, lakes, streams and bays--somethng we as a National \nmust never take for granted.\n  Once again, I congratulate NACWA on this important milestone as an \norganization and applaud its members for their outstanding \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/25/senate-section/article/S4182-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/25/senate-section/article/S4182-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/25/senate-section/article/S4182-4", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ENROLLED BILL PRESENTED\n\n  The Secretary of the Senate reported that on April 22, 2005, she had \npresented to the President of the United States the following enrolled \nbill:\n\n       S. 167.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to establish a \nrural water supply program in the Reclamation States to provide a \nclear, safe affordable, and reliable water supply to rural residents; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in the 1746 Poor Richard's Almanac, \nBenjamin Franklin wrote, ``When the well is dry, we learn the worth of \nwater.'' Nowhere is the bottom of the well approaching more quickly \nthan in western United States. Nearly depleted aquifers and \ndeteriorated infrastructure on which our small and rural communities \nrely coupled with their inability to raise large amounts of capital to \nafford water infrastructure has resulted in substantial want. When the \nwater dries up, so will many of our communities. As such, the scarcity \nof water in rural western communities is a dire situation.\n  An article appearing on April 15, 2005 in the Wall Street Journal \nelucidates the breadth of our Nation's water infrastructure need. The \narticle states that most water infrastructure and water treatment \nplants in the U.S. are more than 50 years old and, in many cases, are \nmore than 100 years old. The huge capital outlays needed to \nrehabilitate this aging and, in many cases, deteriorated infrastructure \nfar exceeds the ability of many rural communities to pay. Neither can \nthese communities accommodate the costs in their rate structures nor \nare the necessary capital outlays within their bonding capacity. \nExacerbating this problem is that, in many western states such as\n\n[[Page S4186]]\n\nmy home state of New Mexico, ground water supplies for which many \ncommunities have relied on for water are nearly depleted. In many \ncases, the only practicable alternative for providing water to these \ncommunities is to build public works projects to transport water from \nother sources. This, too, requires large sums of money which rural and \nsmall communities can ill-afford.\n  Today, I rise to introduce the Rural Water Supply Act of 2005. This \nbill would begin the process of providing for the essential water needs \nof rural communities in the western United States. It establishes a \nfederal loan guarantee program within the Bureau of Reclamation that \nwould allow rural communities to obtain loans at interest rates far \nlower than had the loans not been guaranteed by the Federal Government. \nThis allows rural communities access to the large sums of money \nrequired to construct water infrastructure while recognizing the \nsignificant demand on the Bureau's budget. The bill also expedites the \nappraisal and feasibility studies which allow these communities to \nassess how best to address their water supply needs and act \naccordingly. At present, rural communities have to wait for Congress to \ndirect the Bureau of Reclamation to proceed with appraisal and \nfeasibility studies. This bill expedites the appraisal and feasibility \nlevel process by requiring that, upon request of the community, the \nBureau perform a study, provide funds to a rural water community to \nperform them, or accept and review studies undertaken independently by \na community. This bill will provide much needed assistance to \nstruggling communities.\n  I would like to thank Senator Bingaman, the ranking member of the \nCommittee of Energy and Natural Resources who I have had the great \npleasure of serving with for over two decades for being an original co-\nsponsor of this bill. In addition, I very much appreciate the \nwillingness of the Bureau of Reclamation to work with my staff on this \nimportant matter.\n  Preserving our rural communities in the west requires that we address \nthis instantly and vigorously. The U.S. Congress cannot sit idly by as \nwater shortages cause death to our rural communities. I assure you that \nthis bill will receive prompt consideration in the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee and it is my sincere hope that the Senate will give \nthis legislation its every consideration.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 895\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to modify the optional method of computing net \nearnings from self-employment; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \naddress an injustice in the Tax Code that is threatening family farmers \nand other self-employed individuals. Some of my constituents, primarily \nWisconsin farmers, have requested Congress's assistance to correct the \nTax Code so they can protect their families. The legislation I \nintroduce today, the Farmer Tax Fairness Act of 2005, is similar to \nlegislation I introduced last Congress and will solve the problem for \ntoday and into the future.\n  Farming is vital to Wisconsin. Wisconsin's agricultural industry \nplays a large and important role in the growth and prosperity of the \nentire State. Wisconsin's status as ``America's Dairyland,'' is central \nto our State's agriculture industry. Wisconsin's dairy farmers produce \napproximately 23 billion pounds of milk and 25 percent of the country's \nbutter a year. But Wisconsin's farmers produce much more than milk; \nthey also are national leaders in the production of cheese, potatoes, \nginseng, cranberries, various processing vegetables, and many organic \nfoods. So when the hard-working farmers of Wisconsin need help, I will \ndo all I can to assist.\n  One concern that I have heard from Wisconsin farmers is that the Tax \nCode can limit their eligibility for social safety net programs, \nincluding old age, survivors, and disability insurance, OASDI, under \nSocial Security and the hospital insurance HI part of Medicare. These \nprograms are paid for through payroll taxes on workers and through the \nself-employment tax on the income of self-employed individuals. To be \neligible for OSADI and HI benefits an individual must be fully insured \nand must have earned a minimum amount of income in the years \nimmediately preceding the need for coverage. Every year, the Social \nSecurity Administration, SSA, sets the amount of earned\n\n[[Page S4190]]\n\nincome that individuals must pay taxes on to earn quarters of coverage, \nQCs, and maintain their benefits. An individual's eligibility \nrequirements depend upon the age at which death or disability occurs, \nbut for workers over 31 years of age, they must have earned at least 20 \nQCs within the past 10 years.\n  Self-employed individuals can have highly variable income, and, \nparticularly for farmers who are at the whim of Mother Nature, not \nevery year is a good year. During lean years, individuals may not earn \nenough income to maintain adequate coverage under OASDI and HI. \nTherefore, the Tax Code provides options to allow self-employed \nindividuals to maintain eligibility for benefits. These options allow \nindividuals to choose to pay taxes based on $1,600 of earned income, \nthus allowing self-employed entrepreneurs to maintain the same Federal \nprotections even when their income varies.\n  Unfortunately, both the options for farmers and nonfarmers--Social \nSecurity Act 211(a) and I.R.C. Sec. 1402(a)--have not kept pace with \ninflation, and they no longer provide security to families across the \ncountry. Decades ago, self-employment income of $1,600 earned an \nindividual four QCs under SSA's calculations. In 2001, the amount \nneeded to earn a QC rose to $830 of earned income, so individuals \nelecting the optional methods were only able to earn one QC per year, \nmaking it much harder for them to remain eligible for benefits because \nthey must average 2 QCs per year to be eligible.\n\n  Congress's failure to address this problem threatens the ability of \nself-employed individuals to maintain eligibility for OASDI and HI. I \nhave heard from several of my constituent who want these options to be \nfixed so they can make sure their families will be taken care of in the \nevent that something unforeseen occurs.\n  Therefore, I am introducing the Farmer Tax Fairness Act of 2005 in \norder to provide farmers and self-employed individuals with a fair \nchoice. Under this bill, they will continue to be able to elect the \noptional method if they so choose. When individuals do elect the \noption, this legislation provides an update to the Tax Code so farmers \nand self-employed individuals can retain full eligibility for OASDI and \nHI benefits. It indexes the optional income levels to SSA's QC \ncalculations, allowing these farmers and self-employed individuals to \nclaim enough earned income to qualify for four OCs annually. In \naddition, by linking the earned income level to SSA's requirements for \nQCs, the bill will ensure that the amount of income deemed to be earned \nunder the optional methods will not need to be adjusted by Congress \nagain.\n  Along with providing security to self-employed individuals and \nfarmers across the country, this solution is fiscally responsible. It \nactually provides a short run increase in U.S. Treasury revenues while \nhaving negligible impact upon the Social Security trust fund in the \nlong run.\n  Let me take a moment to acknowledge the efforts of the Senator from \nIowa, Mr. Grassley, to address this problem in the 107th Congress. As \nchairman of the Senate Finance Committee, he included similar \nlegislative language in the chairman's mark for the Small Business and \nFarm Economic Recovery Act of 2002. The Senate Finance Committee held a \nmarkup on the legislation on September 19, 2002, but the changes to the \noptional methods did not become law.\n  When incomes fall, the Tax Code provides optional methods for \ncalculating net earnings to ensure that farmers and self-employed \nindividuals maintain eligibility for social safety net programs. When \nthese provisions were developed, Congress intended self-employed \nindividuals to have the ability to pay enough to earn a full 4 QCs. \nUnfortunately the Tax Code has not kept up with the times and due to \ninflation many farmers are losing eligibility for some of Social \nSecurity's programs. Congress needs to provide security to farm \nfamilies and other self-employed individuals. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Farmer Tax Fairness Act of 2005.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 896\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \nthe calculation of the reserve allowance for medical benefits of plans \nsponsored by bona fide associations; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to clarify \nthe tax treatment of a narrow range of health plans sponsored by \nassociations. I am joined in this effort by my good friends and \ncolleagues, the Chairman and the Ranking Democratic Member of the \nFinance Committee respectively, Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus.\n  For many years, trade associations of small businesses have sponsored \nplans for their member companies to provide health care coverage to \ntheir employees. These plans have helped thousands of small businesses \nacross the country control rising health care costs and keep \nadministrative costs to a minimum.\n  Unfortunately, final regulations issued by the Internal Revenue \nService in 2003 concerning ``10-or-more'' employer health benefit plans \nthat use the experience-rating method threaten to shut down the health \nplans of many associations. Essentially, these regulations state that \nhealth plans that utilize experience rating are not allowed to \naccumulate reserves, forcing them into the untenable position of either\n\n[[Page S4191]]\n\noperating on a break-even basis or losing money.\n  These regulations were not aimed directly at association health \nplans, but at certain other employer-provided benefits, such as life \nand disability insurance, where the IRS has found a pattern of abuse \namong some companies. However, the proposed implementation of the \nregulations make it impossible for an association to continue operating \na health plan for the group's small business members, even where no \nabuse of the rules has occurred.\n  For example, in my home State of Utah, at least one association of \nsmall businesses has already been negatively affected by these \nregulations. This association has dozens of small business members that \nare dependent upon the health plan the association has had in place for \ndecades. Compliance with the regulations will very likely lead to \nincreased costs for health coverage for the 1,300 employees and their \n2,200 dependents of these small businesses. If the trust is not able to \nproperly reserve funds for the future, some of these businesses could \nbe forced to drop out as premiums rise higher and higher and the plan \nis unable to offset those increases with the reserves.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would correct this problem \nby providing that medical benefit plans of bona fide associations may \nhave a reserve of up to 35 percent. This amount is designed to give \nassociation health plans the flexibility they need without raising the \npotential for abuse.\n  In the face of rising health care costs, employers that offer health \ncoverage to their employees are struggling to maintain these benefits, \nand those who do not offer coverage find the cost of providing this \nimportant advantage increasingly out of reach. With the recent 59 \npercent spike in health care costs over the past five years, employers \nhave had to resort to various cost-cutting moves in order to keep \nproviding health care benefits. The IRS regulations affecting 10-or-\nmore employer health benefit plans could strike a devastating blow to \nmany small businesses, forcing them to stop providing health care \nbenefits altogether, or at least making the coverage more expensive \nand/or less available to employees.\n  This legislation was developed with bipartisan support. It is \nnoncontroversial. It corrects a problem created by a well-meaning \nregulation that inadvertently overreached its target. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to help us correct this error and not allow medical benefit \nhealth plans offered by small business associations to be forced to \nshut down, leaving thousands of employees facing higher costs for \nmedical coverage, or worse, no coverage at all.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 897\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ALLOWANCE OF RESERVE FOR MEDICAL BENEFITS OF PLANS \n                   SPONSORED BY BONA FIDE ASSOCIATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 419A(c) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 (relating to account limit) is amended by adding \n     at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(6) Additional reserve for medical benefits of bona fide \n     association plans.--\n       ``(A) In general.--An applicable account limit for any \n     taxable year may include a reserve in an amount not to exceed \n     35 percent of the sum of--\n       ``(i) the qualified direct costs, and\n       ``(ii) the change in claims incurred, but unpaid, for such \n     taxable year with respect to medical benefits (other than \n     post-retirement medical benefits).\n       ``(B) Applicable account limit.--For purposes of this \n     subsection, the term `applicable account limit' means an \n     account limit for a qualified asset account with respect to \n     medical benefits provided through a plan maintained by a bona \n     fide association (as defined in section 2791(d)(3) of the \n     Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg-91(d)(3))''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years ending after December 31, 2004.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, \nSenators Hatch and Grassley, in introducing legislation that will allow \nassociations to make health insurance available to employers without \neither wondering if the full premium is deductible, or holding minimal \nreserves.\n  Across this country, many associations sponsor health insurance plans \nfor member employers--plans that provide health coverage for thousands \nof working Americans. These arrangements allow smaller employers to get \na better deal on insurance than they could on their own. As we struggle \nto improve the number of Americans who have health insurance coverage, \nwe surely want to encourage an arrangement that provides cost-effective \nhealth benefits.\n  In order to smooth the cost of these medical benefits, these plans \noften hold reserves that are more than is necessary to cover unpaid \nclaims that have been incurred at the end of the year. We should \nencourage that practice. But current law discourages these plans from \nholding more than the bare minimum in reserve.\n  The problem is that these plans use welfare trusts as a vehicle to \nfund the benefits. Under current law, if a state trade association \nsponsors a health welfare trust, and that trust does not charge every \nparticipant the same premium, then that plan may have to go back to \nemployers after the end of the year and say ``Sorry. You can't deduct \nall of that premium we asked you to pay last year.'' Either that, or \nthe association has to keep premiums low enough to avoid non-deductible \ncontributions, and risk under-funding the benefits. That is not a good \noutcome.\n  So we have a simple solution here. This bill allows these association \nhealth plans to maintain reserves of thirty-five percent of annual \ncosts without jeopardizing the deductibility of employer contributions \nto the trust. With current technology, claims are usually processed in \na matter of days, not months, so thirty-five percent of annual costs is \nmore than is normally needed to cover unpaid claims at the end of the \nyear. That will leave a cushion to cover adverse experience, and help \nsmooth future premium fluctuations.\n  This simple change will allow bona fide associations all over this \ncountry to not only continue providing health benefits, but to secure \nthose benefits with adequate reserves. Plans like the State Bankers \nAssociation Group Benefits Trust that has been operating out of my home \ntown of Helena, Montana, since 1978. This Trust provides health \ninsurance to employees of banks in Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho. Forty-\nnine Montana banks provide coverage for nearly 3,000 Montanans through \nthis program.\n  This bill is important to the employers and employees who get health \ninsurance coverage through the State Bankers' trust, and the many other \nassociation health trusts in Montana and around the country. We \nencourage our colleagues to join us in helping associations continue to \nprovide health benefits to tens of thousands of American workers and \ntheir families.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \n        Kennedy, and Mr. Cochran):\n  S. 898.

Mr. President, this bill conveys 3.4 acres on the \nBeaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest to Jefferson County, MT and 10 \nacres on the Kootenai National Forest to Sanders County, MT for \ncontinued use as cemeteries.\n  The Elkhorn Cemetery in Jefferson County has been used as a cemetery \nsince the 1860's. Due to surveying errors and limited information when \nthe National Forest boundaries were surveyed in the early 1900's, the \ncemetery was included as National Forest lands. The cemetery is still \nin use by local families who homesteaded and worked the mines in the \narea. However, Forest Service manual direction strongly discourages \nburials on National Forest lands, placing both the families and Forest \nService in an awkward position.\n  The Noxon Cemetery is part of a Kootenai National Forest \nadministrative site that is currently for sale. The cemetery has been \nused since at least 1910 and contains over 300 graves. Sanders County \nwants to protect the cemetery from potential damage, and the Forest \nService wants to remove the encumbrance of the cemetery from the \nadministrative site sale or future Federal ownership.\n  In both locations, it is clear the cemeteries should not have been \nincluded as part of the National Forest. The County Commissioners and \nthe local public strongly support the conveyance.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 899\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

In addition, every \nday 33 babies are born in the United States with permanent hearing \nloss, making it one of the most frequently occurring birth defects. The \nimpact of delayed detection and intervention can last a lifetime.\n  When hearing loss is found early, intervention and treatment can \nproduce dramatic improvements in child speech and language development \nby school age.\n  This Resolution will raise public awareness of the 28 million \nAmericans who suffer from hearing loss and the importance of early \ndetection and treatment.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this Resolution \nas research shows that children identified with hearing loss early and \nthose who receive appropriate early qualified intervention by the age \nof six months have significantly improved speech skills than children \nwhose hearing loss is identified later.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/25/senate-section/article/S4194-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 122--RECOGNIZING THE HISTORIC EFFORTS OF THE REPUBLIC \n   OF KAZAKHSTAN TO REDUCE THE THREAT OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION \n  THROUGH COOPERATION IN THE NUNN-LUGAR/COOPERATIVE THREAT REDUCTION \n  PROGRAM, AND CELEBRATING THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE REMOVAL OF ALL \n            NUCLEAR WEAPONS FROM THE TERRITORY OF KAZAKHSTAN\n\n  Mr. LUGAR submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, today I submit a Senate resolution to \ncelebrate the decision made by Kazakhstan to join the Nuclear \nNonproliferation Treaty (NPT) as a non-nuclear weapon state. Ten years \nago this month Kazakhstan sent the last Soviet nuclear warhead on its \nterritory to Russia.\n  With the Review Conference on the NPT in New York starting next week, \nit is an especially important time to note the progress made toward the \nNPT's goals, with U.S. assistance, in Kazakhstan.\n  More than a decade ago, when the Soviet Union collapsed, Kazakhstan \nbecame the fourth largest nuclear power in the world. But instead of \nenlarging the nuclear club, Kazakhstan joined Ukraine and Belarus in \nturning away from weapons of mass destruction. Courageous leaders chose \ninstead to embrace the NPT in removing all nuclear arms from \nKazakhstan.\n  The world cheered when Kazakhstan formally acceded to the NPT. I am \nproud of the role the United States played in Kazakhstan's decision and \nof our role in facilitating the removal of thousands of nuclear \nwarheads and the elimination of hundreds of SS-18 intercontinental \nballistic missiles, silos, and command centers. The addition of three \nmore nuclear-armed states would have been a devastating setback for the \nNPT.\n  It is particularly important that the Senate draw attention to \nKazakhstan's wise and brave choice, as it stands in stark contrast to \nevents in India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Iran. In 1998, the world \nwas shocked by the testing of nuclear weapons in India and Pakistan. In \nJanuary 2003, the durability of the NPT was shaken by North Korea's \npurported withdrawal. We have watched for the past two years as the \nIAEA deliberated over Iran's numerous safeguards violations amid \nTehran's threats of withdrawal from the NPT should the body seek to \nenforce the treaty's provisions.\n  With these events in mind, we should remember Kazakhstan. Instead of \nviolating international norms and retaining nuclear weapons, Kazakh \nleaders made the right choice. When searching for success stories, the \ninternational community can turn to Kazakhstan.\n  The Nunn-Lugar Program also assisted Kazakhstan in eliminating the \nformer Soviet nuclear weapons testing complex at the Degelen Mountain \nTest Tunnel Complex and at Balapan. In close cooperation with Kazakh \npartners, the Nunn-Lugar program systematically dismantled the complex \nand sealed nearly 200 nuclear test tunnels and shafts. These facilities \nwill never again contribute to the weapons systems that threatened the \nworld during the Cold War.\n  The United States, Kazakhstan, and the international community still \nhave much work to do and these efforts will require compromise and \nsacrifice. The last ten years have shown that nothing is impossible. \nBoth sides have set aside past differences to accomplish this \ncooperation. Let us continue to approach these challenges with \ncreativity, a willingness to cooperate, and a commitment to the NPT.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/25/senate-section/article/S4194-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOTICES OF HEARINGS/MEETINGS\n\n\n                 committee on rules and administration\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

In this \neulogy where I simply read the names and tell you how this happened, we \nhave talked about people from the age of 19 to 51 years old. In this \nwar, we have people of all ages because it is the regular military and \nalso Reserves and National Guard. We have a lot of people who are \nmarried with children. The loss is huge, regardless of age. Often, \nthere are even more people who are effected when we have someone who is \nmarried with a family--not only the moms and dads but the spouses and \nthe children and the broader community.\n  So I pray for these young Americans, may they rest in peace; and I \npray for their families, may they heal. It is the ultimate act of \nbravery to answer the call of the Commander in Chief. It is the \nultimate act of bravery. I was in Iraq last month, and the security \nchallenges we face there are enormous. I don't have the time tonight to \ngo into detail. It was a bipartisan trip of Senators, and each Senator \nhad two guards at all times with machine guns, plus additional security \nall around us. We could not go on the main road from Baghdad Airport \nbecause of the lack of safety. We flew in Blackhawk helicopters with \nthe greatest pilots in the world, with two machine guns looking out at \nall times. Every time we were anywhere on the ground, you could smell \nthe danger. We were so well protected. Even in the General Assembly \nbuilding, where you would think it would be very safe, they said it was \nthe site of kidnappings.\n  Even in the Embassy compound, we heard that one of the military \npeople killed there, LCDR Keith Taylor, died January 29 in a rocket \nattack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. That is a highly protected and \ndefended place. We sat there, and I noted the looks on the faces of the \ncivilians sitting around--the fear, the anguish, the anxiety. I made a \npoint of thanking them for their service. I know they want to build a \ndemocracy there. I noted how fearful and anxious they looked. I truly \nexpected at least one of them to say: No, you are misreading it; that \nis not so. But they did not contradict it.\n  It is a very dangerous place. I think we all learned that through \nloss of that beautiful young woman, Marla Ruzicka, who is a true hero \nof her generation, if not the country. She was working in Iraq with a \nnonprofit organization she set up that actually was funded by this \nSenate, I am proud to say, to find the innocent victims of war, what we \ncall collateral damage of war. Marla put a face on these little \nchildren and these grieving mothers and fathers.\n  She would go out into the homes of the Iraqi people--it is so \ndangerous to do that--with her blond hair flying. She would take the \ntestimony, and then she would bring it back to the military who grew to \ntrust Marla. Then, if it all checked out, these people would get some \nrecompense to try and rebuild their lives.\n  It was a very moving funeral I went to with my family in Lakeport, \nCA. People came from all over the country and all over the world to \nhonor Marla. I know Senator Leahy, on our side, has taken the lead on \nthis incredible program. I hope to work with him and Members of both \nsides of the aisle to make sure that program continues.\n  Of course, we need to have a plan for success in Iraq, and my view is \nwe do not have that right now. When we ask the people who brought us \nthe war, namely the President, how long we are going to be there, he \nsays: As long as it takes. I think we can do better. I think there are \nfive or six things we can do. But, again, I do not have time to go into \nit tonight, and I have spoken about this at length before.\n  Clearly, training the Iraqis is key, and General Petraeus told us \nwhen we met with him that he is very high on the Iraqi troops. He \nthinks they are terrific. He thinks they can step in. There are 120,000 \nof them. This is good news. We ought to be able to begin to bring our \ntroops home and replace them with the Iraqis.\n  I also met with the new leaders of the country, and I believe if we \ndo not set some dates, they will forever rely on us. I do not think \nthat is the way it should be. I really do not. They need to get on \ntheir own two feet, and we ought to help them--train these soldiers, \ntrain these police forces and bring our troops back.\n  It is not working out well for us over there. It is counterproductive \nright now. The CIA told us that when we visited. Indeed, the head of \nthe CIA told us in hearings that it is fueling the insurgency. General \nNewbolt, who planned the original military victory in Iraq, told us the \nsame. We need to have a goal of when we are going to leave because \notherwise it is fueling discontent. The insurgency is so deep now. \nDifferent groups are coming every day taking ``credit'' for these \nhorrible civilian deaths.\n  The status quo is not good there. I hope we can move forward with a \nplan for success. A lot of our people have given their lives and their \nlimbs, thousands of them coming home without limbs, over 11,000 at this \npoint. We need to stand with them and with their families and make sure \nwe are there for them because they are suffering mightily.\n  They are brave, they are courageous, they will do whatever they are \nasked to do. They are extraordinary. We need to stand with them, \nregardless of whether we think this war was the best thing we ever did \nor the worst thing we ever did. That is secondary. We have to stand \nwith them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/25/senate-section/article/S4217-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4217-S4219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            WELDON AMENDMENT\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, Senator Frist was true to his word. He \ntold me I could have a vote to repeal what I consider to be a very \ndangerous amendment that came into an appropriations bill without any \nhearings, without any discussions, without any votes, and I think could \nvery well lead to a very dangerous situation for the women of our \ncountry.\n  I decided not to push the vote. It was too close to call. Some people \nsaid\n\n[[Page S4218]]\n\nthere were 56 votes against us. That was not my count, but I knew that \nin order to win this vote I needed to talk with people individually at \ngreat length.\n  Why is that? Because this is one of the most confusing amendments \nthat we have ever faced in the Senate. Just ask the people at HHS, who \nare trying to implement it. Just ask the people who filed suit. They \nsay it is so vague and so broad that it could literally mean people \ncoming into an emergency room, not getting served, and dying in an \nemergency room. This is what could happen.\n  I thank Senator Frist for being true to his word, for giving me the \nopportunity, and I want to briefly explain what I plan to do about this \nWeldon amendment, with the help of my friends and colleagues.\n  Senator Harkin and I plan to work across the aisle to modify this \namendment so that it really is what it claims to be, a conscience \nclause. No one objects to conscience clauses. I support them. Conscious \nclauses are in the law. I am happy to clarify them, make sure anyone \nwho has a moral objection to performing an abortion absolutely has \nevery right not to have to do that.\n  I have talked at length with Senator Harkin, and we are going to work \nwith our colleagues. That means with Senator Specter and the other \nmembers of the Appropriations Committee so they understand the \nramifications of this Weldon amendment, which I will go into in a \nminute.\n  Second, as I mentioned, there have been lawsuits filed challenging \nthe constitutionality of the Weldon amendment. I believe the arguments \nare compelling. As I have said before--and we were proven right when \nother anti-choice amendments that were thrown out of court--I believe \nthis one also will be thrown out. Because it cannot possibly be that \nany judge anywhere, regardless of whether he or she is liberal, \nconservative, moderate, Republican, Democrat, or anything else, would \nput women's lives in danger like this could do. So I feel very \nconfident it will come out all right.\n\n  I am going to give a brief discussion on what I think the Weldon \namendment means as it is now written.\n  Although the proponents of the Weldon amendment call it a conscience \nclause, nowhere in the amendment do we see the words ``religion,'' \n``morals,'' ``beliefs,'' or ``values.'' It is masquerading as a \nconscience clause, but it really is not. I call it a denial clause \nbecause it will deny women emergency care when their lives are in \ndanger, deny low-income rape victims reproductive health care, deny \ndoctors the right to give their patients vital information, and deny \nStates the ability to enforce critical laws ensuring the health of \nwomen.\n  The fact is, our hospitals and doctors already have a Federal \nconscience clause, it's called the 1973 Church Amendment. What Weldon \ndoes is different. It's a big loophole that allows anyone, including \nHMOs, to decide, for any reason, that they do not want any of their \ndoctors not only not performing abortions but also telling a woman that \nit is a legal right for her, referring her, talking to her honestly \nabout what her options are.\n  This amendment is giving a denial clause to an HMO which, by the way, \nI do not think they have a conscience, given the way many of them treat \npeople. So we are giving the HMO, a corporation, a big denial clause--\nnot the doctor, not the nurse but the corporation. So that means they \ncan now gag doctors who work for them by telling them: You better not \ninform a woman about her rights because if you do, it is against the \nguidelines of this HMO.\n  Now, in this Weldon amendment, there is no exception for rape or \nincest. Imagine, there is no exception for rape and incest. So even if \na woman comes in who has been brutally raped or the victim of incest, \nunder this Weldon amendment, the hospital or the HMO could violate \ncurrent law and say: So sorry about that, you are on your own. Now, \nthis is America in 2005. Where is our conscience? Where are our moral \nvalues? Where are our family values if we pass an amendment like this, \nthat would throw a woman out in the most dire of circumstances? It is \njust horrific.\n  And this goes against our Medicaid law. The Hyde amendment makes an \nexception for rape and incest if a woman is on Medicaid and if she is \npoor. Henry Hyde and I talked about that quite a bit, and he supported \nthat very much. First the exception was if one's life is at stake, they \ncan get Medicaid help to end the pregnancy. Then it was rape and \nincest. There is no such exception in Weldon, and guess what happens. \nIf the Medicaid law is enforced, states can now lose all of their \nFederal funds for education, labor, and health. This is just crazy. It \nmakes no sense at all.\n  We believe that Weldon would allow a woman to die in an emergency \nroom. There are very unbelievably tragic stories. Let us say a woman is \nin a car accident while she is in the early stages of her pregnancy. \nShe is rushed into the emergency room, and she is losing blood. The \nonly way to save her life is to terminate the pregnancy. Under Weldon, \nif the hospital says, I am sorry, we do not do that, she could just \nsimply die waiting for help. This is what Weldon does. This is why I \ncannot believe a judge is going to allow it to continue.\n  So the Weldon amendment is drawn in such a way that all the laws we \nhave--including the emergency room law ensuring a hospital takes \nmeasures to stabilize patients if their lives are endanger and the \nMedicaid law that allows a woman to get an abortion if she is raped or \nthe victim of incest--are overridden by Weldon. Any State law that \nsteps in to help guarantee reproductive services and referrals to woman \nis overridden by Weldon. And if States enforces their own law to help a \nwoman in a crisis, they can lose all of their Federal funds, not just \ntheir family planning funds but every dollar of their education money, \ntheir labor money, and their health money. We are talking about \nbillions of dollars across the board.\n  We all know it is totally unconstitutional to gag a doctor. Every \nyear the anti-choice people pass a Mexico City gag rule, which I am \nproud to say the Senate does not support, but the President does, and \nit always manages to survive. The gag rule is in effect abroad, but \nthey cannot do it here. Why? Because in this country we have freedom of \nspeech, and a gag cannot be put around a doctor's mouth and tell them \nthey cannot let their patients know all of their options; that is \nunconstitutional. But here, under Weldon, an HMO can gag any doctor \nthat works for it. So it is really completely outrageous.\n  In essence, we are going to have a whole series of laws overturned by \nthe Weldon amendment. The odd thing is, if the backers of the Weldon \namendment would come to the table and tell us all the things they want \nto do, we could have an honest debate. The trouble we have is that the \npeople who support Weldon will say: All we have is a conscience clause. \nBut that isn't the case.\n  We have letters from doctors, patients, States, and we have lawsuits \nthat really unmask the true ramifications of Weldon. What we have is a \nprovision that masquerades as a conscience clause when it is really a \ndenial clause that would punish States. These are the people who I \nthought liked States rights.\n  Let us take the issue of hospital mergers. In the past, under current \nlaw, every State in the Union that I know of has the ability, when a \nhospital merges, to set conditions for those mergers. The attorneys \ngeneral of those States have the right to put conditions on those \nmergers. Under Weldon, that's no longer possible if such conditions \ninclude making sure that in this merger a woman has still reproductive \nhealth care. So it is taking away the rights of States, and that is \nagain why I believe we can fix this, because it is so dangerous in its \ncurrent form.\n  We have this amendment masquerading as a conscience clause. But it is \nnot a conscience clause, it is a denial clause because it will deny \nwomen the health care they need to live, to be helped and saved in an \nemergency. It will gag doctors. It will stop attorneys general in all \nof our States from carrying out their duties. A couple of States have \nsued on behalf of this. Many who must implement it have thrown their \nhands up. They do not know how to enforce it. It never had a hearing in \nthe Senate. We never looked at it, and it passed as part of the \nappropriations bill.\n\n[[Page S4219]]\n\n  Again, I thank Senator Frist for living up to his commitment he made \nto me. I appreciate it. What we are going to do is continue to work to \nlet everyone know how outrageous this law is, how far reaching this law \nis, how dangerous this law is to women, how it walks away from family \nvalues, from States rights, from anything decent when one says to a \nwoman who has been raped or is the victim of incest that she is on her \nown. That is not what this country is about.\n  At some point, we are going to make sure that this Weldon amendment \nis either modified so it becomes what it says it is, which is a \nconscience clause that no one has an objection to, or is repealed.\n  How much more time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 23 minutes \nremaining.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/25/senate-section/article/S4219-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         JOHN BOLTON NOMINATION\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to close on a couple of topics. The \nfirst one, because I sit on the Foreign Relations Committee, is the \nnomination of John Bolton to be our Ambassador to the United Nations. I \ndo call on the President to rethink this nomination. Out of the \nthousands of strong, conservative Republicans who care about the world, \nthere has to be somebody better than someone who has a pattern of not \nonly abusing his staff, called a serial abuser by one witness, but \nalso, and this is really threatening, trying to get them fired if they \ndo not give him the information he wants.\n  I am talking about false information and reaching down from the very \nhigh level at which he has been to the bottom of another agency that he \ndid not even have direct line control over and trying to force not one \nbut two and maybe three intelligence analysts to paint a picture that \nhe wanted to use so that he could present a country as an imminent \nthreat to this Nation, which could have led to some serious \nramifications. Of all the people to pick now, it should not be someone \nwho would try to politicize intelligence gathering.\n  I received another letter on Friday, which I sent to both sides of \nthe committee. I hope this will be looked at. It concerns a case where \nyears ago John Bolton was trying to overturn a U.N. resolution--or have \nit modified--that dealt with infant formula in the developing nations. \nSome of my colleagues may remember that issue, where babies were dying \nthroughout the developing world because they were mixing the baby \nformula with contaminated water, and the U.N. voted very strongly to \nstop distributing and selling that baby formula. According to this \nwoman, who has a lot of credentials--an attorney who worked with John \nBolton--she said that Bolton ordered her to contact these developing \nnations and tell them to back off and modify this resolution so that \nNestle Company and others could sell their product in the developing \nworld. And this is interesting--conscience clause--she said: My \nconscience does not allow me to do this because if one baby died as a \nresult of what I did, I could not live with myself. There is a \nconscience clause in the agency that says if somebody has a conscience \nproblem when given an assignment, they do not have to do it. Well, \nBolton said, if you do not do this, you are fired, and he fired her on \nthe spot, according to her. She is going to go under oath and testify \nto this. Then he found out he could not fire her because she was \nprotected by Civil Service. She comes back to work, and what do they \nfind? Her entire office had been moved. Where is it moved? To the \nbasement of the building. No telephone. A desk and a chair. She loved \nher job, and she eventually got a telephone down there and worked \naround John Bolton and stayed there doing her work.\n\n  This is yet another story. So we have a pattern of abusive behavior. \nSome of my friends on the other side of the aisle say, this is just the \nperson we need for the U.N.--somebody tough. If you want someone in the \nU.N. who has a history of trying to change intelligence information--\nand now the world knows it.\n  As my ranking member Joe Biden has stated, this is the guy who may \nhave to make the intelligence case against Iran. This is the guy who \nmay have to make the intelligence case against North Korea with this \nbackground of using political pressure to get the kind of intelligence \nhe wanted to build a case. This is not the right person. We do not want \nsomeone there who will politicize intelligence gathering. I don't think \nwe want someone there who is such a hothead that it will turn a lot of \npeople off.\n  We have testimony from multiple sources. At first, my friends on the \nother side of the committee said it is an isolated incident; you are \ntalking about one incident. We have incident after incident.\n  Oh, he is just the person we need. We want someone tough. Tough is \none thing. Tough and principled and committed is one thing. Abusing \npeople is something else. A man is called a serial abuser by someone \nwho has the credentials to know--e-mails back this up--trying to get \npeople fired because they want to do their job.\n  It was so bad that Colin Powell, the Secretary of State, had to \nactually go and talk to all these ``independent'' analysts; his message \nwas, don't you worry about it. You continue to do your work. I thank \nhim for that. The testimony is clear. He went there and told those \nanalysts, don't you be bullied. I am using those words. But the message \nhe had was, don't you worry about it. Do your work. Do your job. It is \nvery clear.\n  How refreshing it was to see Senator Voinovich, at the committee, \nlisten to what Senator Biden, in particular, was saying. They had the \ninformation, chapter and verse, proof of why this is not a good \nappointment.\n  I know the pressures that have come to bear on Senator Voinovich. It \nis not pleasant to be alone. I have been there. I know how it feels. \nBut he is answering to his conscience. I think he did the Senate proud \nby doing that.\n  Now we hear other colleagues on the committee saying maybe they need \nmore time and more information.\n  Again, this can all be avoided. There are so many other people who \ncan do this job. I said before that John Bolton is very loyal to this \nconservative doctrine. There could be many positions for him in the \nadministration. We need someone in the spirit of John Danforth--\nRepublican, conservative, wonderful former Senator who went to the \nUnited Nations, who immediately had the support and the credibility and \nthe respect.\n  In closing, I will talk about an issue I know the Presiding Officer \nhas been very involved with, and that is the filibuster issue. As \nsomeone who once wanted to end a filibuster myself at an early stage, I \nnow understand how foolish I was at that point. Why did I want it to \nend when I first came here as freshman? We had the majority and the \nRepublicans were thwarting us. It was very frustrating. We wanted to \nfix everything. I voted to say this filibuster has to go.\n  Little did I realize that is the way the Senate is supposed to \noperate in a deliberative fashion. As one of the Founders said, the \nHouse is the cup. It gets hot. It is steaming. And when the issues get \nto the Senate, it is the saucer. They cool down. One of the ways to \nensure that is to have extended debate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/25/senate-section/article/S4219-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4219-S4223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               FILIBUSTER\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, there has been so much misinformation on \nthe filibuster I want to make sure I put my thoughts into the record. \nWe hear Republican Senators actually get up and say they never \nfilibustered any judges. I was stunned, so we went back into history \nand we have a chart for that.\n  The first filibuster in modern times was started by the Republicans \nin 1968 against Abe Fortas for the Supreme Court. We know there have \nbeen 11 in recent times, 11 filibusters. Here is one in 1971, probably \nstarted by the Democrats, William Rehnquist to be a Supreme Court \njustice. Here is one in 1980, probably started by the Republicans, \nStephen Breyer, to be a judge on the First Circuit Court of Appeals. \nThen in 1984 Harvie Wilkinson, Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. In \n1986, Sydney Fitzwater, to be a judge for the Northern District of \nTexas. 1992, Edward Earle Carnes to be judge on the Eleventh Circuit. \n1994, Lee Sarokin to be a judge on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. \nIn 1999, Brian Theodore Stewart, to be a judge for the District\n\n[[Page S4220]]\n\nof Utah. In the year 2000--and this is my State--there was a major \nfilibuster; we fought hard and we beat the filibuster. We got the votes \nneeded, Richard Paez to be a judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals and Marsha Berzon to be a judge on the Ninth Circuit.\n  When we hear Republicans say they never launched a filibuster, you \ncan ask, what? Here is Bob Smith who led the filibuster, Republican, \nfrom New Hampshire. Here is what he said:\n\n       . . . It is no secret that I have been the person who has \n     filibustered these two nominations, Judge Berzon and Judge \n     Paez.\n\n  Here he is again:\n\n       So don't tell me we haven't filibustered judges and that we \n     don't have the right to filibuster judges on the floor of the \n     Senate. Of course we do. That is our constitutional role.\n\n  Here is a Republican Senator who started a filibuster against two \njudge nominees for the Ninth Circuit. He called this a ``constitutional \nrole.'' Now we have other Republicans saying the constitutional option \nis no filibuster. Wrong. You are contradicting your own people here.\n  Now, Orrin Hatch himself admitted there were filibusters on the \nfloor:\n\n       Indeed, I must confess to being somewhat baffled that, \n     after a filibuster is cut off by cloture, the Senate could \n     still delay a final vote on nomination.\n\n  That is Orrin Hatch. This is the major point I want to make, Who is \nthe real leader out there pushing to end the filibuster on judges? \nPushing, pushing, pushing?\n  And, by the way, it is unbelievable we have confirmed 205 of George \nW. Bush's nominees to the courts. We have stopped 10. Let me say it \nagain: 205 have gotten through and we have stopped 10.\n  Now, do the math, and I will say to you: In your life, if you get 95 \npercent of what you want, wouldn't you go around with a smile on your \nface? I would. If I got 95 percent of what I wanted from the Senate, I \nwould be so happy. If I got 95 percent of what I wanted from my \nfamily--if they sought my way 95 percent of the time--I would be happy; \nespecially when they were teenagers, I would be really happy.\n  But do you know what. If I were arrogant, and I wanted everything, \nand I thought I knew best all the time, and I wanted to grab all the \npower, I would be sunk. So these folks over here, who got 95 percent of \nwhat they wanted--205 judges, and then 10 whom we thought were out of \nthe mainstream--and, by the way, wow, are they out of the mainstream--\nthey are unhappy. And now they are going to change the rules in the \nmiddle of the game.\n  For 200 years of our Constitution we have been able to speak and \nexpress ourselves. I have to tell you, this is dangerous to our \ndemocracy. When one party wants its all, when one party wants to stop \nminority rights, that is dangerous. And that is where we are.\n  But here is the best of all--and I hope people will know this--when \nwe had this filibuster on Marsha Berzon, and when we had this \nfilibuster of Richard Paez, guess who voted to keep the filibuster \ngoing on Richard Paez. I will give you a clue. He appeared on a big \nscreen over the weekend. I will give you another clue. He was elected \nby the Republicans to be the majority leader of the Senate, Bill Frist. \nHe says filibusters are terrible, filibusters are wrong. Yet he voted \nto continue the filibuster on Richard Paez.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Executive vote No. 37 of \nMarch 8, 2000, on Richard Paez to cut off the filibuster be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the vote was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                YEAS--85\n\n     Abraham (R-MI)\n     Akaka (D-HI)\n     Ashcroft (R-MO)\n     Baucus (D-MT)\n     Bayh (D-IN)\n     Bennett (R-UT)\n     Biden (D-DE)\n     Bingaman (D-NM)\n     Bond (R-MO)\n     Boxer (D-CA)\n     Breaux (D-LA)\n     Bryan (D-NV)\n     Burns (R-MT)\n     Byrd (D-WV)\n     Campbell (R-CO)\n     Chafee, L.

So let's hold people accountable for what they do and \nsay. I admit I was foolish on the filibuster when I was a freshman and \nI came in here. I also wanted everything to go my way. I was wrong. And \nit is hard for a Senator to say they are wrong. We do not like to admit \nit. But I was wrong. But how can Bill Frist lead the charge, say that \nfilibusters are wrong, it is terrible, it is awful, it is against the \nConstitution, and everything else he says--which I do not agree with \nany of what he said--and then not address the fact that he voted to \nsustain a filibuster. It does not make sense.\n  We have soldiers dying in Iraq, in Afghanistan. Lord knows where they \nare going to go in this very dangerous world. And the mission: to make \nsure democracy thrives. Do you know that when I was in Iraq, we were \ntold one of the reasons the minority groups there, the Kurds, felt \ncomfortable was they knew they were going to copy the model of this \ndemocracy, including the filibuster?\n  They said: Oh, we know we are going to have our rights heard because \nwe are going to have the right to filibuster. They even told that to a \nRepublican Senator who went over there.\n  By the way, when I was in the Palestinian territories--this is \nanother interesting part of my trip--the first thing the Palestinians \nsaid they want to do is make sure their people get a monthly social \nsecurity benefit that is guaranteed. I truly wanted to ask the Minister \nthere--I think he was the Minister of the Interior--to please contact \nPresident Bush and tell him that a guaranteed social security benefit \nwas their first priority, as the President tries to undo the guaranteed \nbenefit for Social Security. That trip I went on was fascinating in so \nmany different ways. But mostly, what I realized was, we need to be the \nmodel of freedom and democracy. If we start taking away minority \nrights, if we start saying we cannot stand to hear each other--by the \nway, I understand it. I know it is painful to hear me speak for some of \nmy colleagues who do not agree with me. They say: Oh, I can't listen to \none more word. And I feel the same way when they start talking about \nthings with which I fundamentally disagree.\n  But that is what it is about here because all of America has to be \nrepresented here, from the most liberal, to the most conservative, to \neverything in between. All of us have to feel represented. But if we \nstop the ability of the other to debate and discuss, especially on \njudges, where it is a lifetime appointment, at a very high salary--they \nnever have to face the electorate. This is the only moment.\n  So what if we say they have to meet a higher bar? That is a good \nthing on behalf of the people. Because--guess what--do you know what \nthey rule on? They rule on everything to do with your life. They rule \non whether there should be child labor. They rule on whether you should \nbe harassed and exploited in the workplace. They rule on whether you \nhave the right to clean air and safe drinking water. They rule on \neverybody's rights: voting rights, civil rights, human rights. They \nrule on whether your child can get a good education. They rule on \nwhether corporate America must provide a safe workplace for you. They \nrule on whether the Federal Government can say that people who pollute \nhave to clean up that pollution.\n  Why do you think there are so many people who want to get every \nsingle judge? Because they want judges of a certain philosophy. That is \nwrong. We should work for mainstream, fair judges--that is what we need \non the bench--who can see all sides. But when one side wants \neverything, when 95 percent is not enough, when 205 to 10 is not good \nenough, beware of what is coming down. Do not change the rules\n\n[[Page S4221]]\n\nin the middle of the game. That is not fair. That is not right. It is \nthrowing a fit over something, when you have gotten 95 percent of what \nyou want.\n  You do not change the rules in the middle of the game, like they did \nin the House on the Ethics Committee. Do not do that. That is not \nright, it is not fair, and it is wrong. It is wrong for the American \npeople.\n\n  Everyone in the world looks to America--everyone in the world. When \nwe start weakening our rules around here, and weakening the rights of \nthe people to exercise the rights they have been given as Senators, we \nare in a lot of trouble.\n  So, Mr. President, I have gone through a number of issues, starting \noff with the most solemn, which was reading the names of those in the \nmilitary who have died, who were either from California or were based \nin California. I promised my constituents I would always come to the \nfloor periodically to remember them. The saddest thing: 26 percent of \nthe dead soldiers happened to be either from California or based in \nCalifornia. That is a huge number. So it is with a very heavy heart \nthat I did that.\n  But we have a lot to do, a lot on our agenda. I hope we will stay \nfocused on the things that matter to the people--on the things that \nmatter to the people. Let's not spend time changing the rules of the \nSenate that we have had for so many years. Let's not do that. Let's do \nthe work. Let's get a success strategy for Iraq. Let's get health care \nfor our people. Let's get education for our children. Let's make sure \nthe air is clean and the water is safe, that we protect our beautiful \nplaces. Let's make sure we attack this issue of gas prices, which in my \nState we are seeing $3 a gallon. I wrote to the FTC, and I said: Please \ninvestigate what is going on with the refiners. Please look at these \nmergers that are coming at us now that will make it even worse.\n  We have work to do. But, no, we have to have our leader go on a \nSunday, or whatever, and--big publicity--address a group about changing \nthe rules of the filibuster. This does not meet the test, it seems to \nme, of doing the job.\n  We know there will be fallout. That is the nuclear option, and \nnuclear explosions have fallout. It doesn't mean shutting down the \nSenate, but I can assure you, it is going to mean working harder in the \nSenate, working really hard, working on some things that maybe we \nhaven't worked on in a while, forcing that. But I have to tell you, 205 \nto 10, you should be smiling, not frowning, not addressing people and \nsaying how terrible you are doing. You should be happy. It is a heck of \na lot better than a lot of Democratic Presidents have done. You should \nbe happy.\n  You should bring us judges that are mainstream, and there wouldn't be \nany filibusters. I have supported so many. You succeeded 205 times. You \nfailed 10 times because you tried to put people on there who really \nwere so far out of the mainstream it would be dangerous.\n  Can't we compromise this thing and come together? Let's get back to \nwork.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my prepared text on the Weldon amendment \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                            Weldon Amendment\n\n       Mr. President, I rise this evening to talk about the Weldon \n     amendment, a sweeping provision endangering women's health \n     that was slipped into the 2005 appropriations bill at the \n     last minute without any hearings, discussions, or votes.\n       In November, Senator Frist promised me an up or down vote \n     on repealing the Weldon amendment by the end of April. Last \n     week, I decided to hold off on that vote for the time being.\n       First, the Weldon amendment will expire in less than 6 \n     months. I believe that the best way to defeat this provision \n     right now is to work with Senator Harkin and Members on both \n     sides of the aisle to remove or modify it in the next \n     spending bill.\n       I have talked at length with Senator Harkin about this. He \n     has promised that he will work closely with Senator Specter \n     and me to underscore our commitment to a real conscience \n     clause for doctors and hospitals without undermining our \n     commitment to the health of women across our country.\n       Second, two lawsuits have already been filed challenging \n     the constitutionality of Weldon. Their arguments are \n     compelling and I believe that the plaintiffs one of which is \n     the California attorney general--will prevail.\n       There has been a lot of misinformation about Weldon. So I \n     thought it would help to show this provision in black and \n     white:\n       Here is what Weldon says:\n       (d)(1) None of the funds made available in this Act may be \n     made available to a Federal agency or program, or to a State \n     or local government, if such agency, program or government \n     subjects any institutional or individual health care entity \n     to discrimination on the basis that the health care entity \n     does not provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for \n     abortions.\n       (2) In this subsection, the term ``health care entity'' \n     includes an individual physician or other health care \n     professional, a hospital, a provider-sponsored organization, \n     a health maintenance organization, a health insurance plan, \n     or any other kind of health care facility, organization or \n     plan.\n       I have read this language over and over again. And nowhere \n     do I find the words ``religion, morals, beliefs, or values.''\n       That is because Weldon is not a conscience clause. It is a \n     denial clause because it could deny women emergency care when \n     their lives are in danger, deny low-income rape victims \n     reproductive health care, deny doctors the right to give \n     their patients vital information, and deny states the ability \n     to enforce critical laws ensuring the health of women.\n       Some are saying that Weldon is needed to protect the \n     religious beliefs of doctors and hospitals that don't want to \n     perform abortions. But that is not true.\n       No Federal law forces any doctor to perform an abortion. \n     And no Federal law forces any hospital to perform an \n     abortion, unless the woman will die without an emergency \n     procedure.\n       In fact, we already have many Federal and State laws \n     protecting the conscience of our health care providers, \n     including the 1973 Church amendment.\n       That conscience clause says that public authorities may not \n     require any individual or health care entity that receives \n     financial assistance under our federal health programs to \n     perform or assist in the performance of any sterilization \n     procedure or abortion if his performance or assistance in the \n     performance of such procedure or abortion would be contrary \n     to his religious beliefs or moral convictions make its \n     facilities available for the performance of any sterilization \n     procedure or abortion if the performance of such procedure or \n     abortion in such facilities is prohibited by the entity on \n     the basis of religious beliefs or moral convictions, or \n     provide any personnel for the performance or assistance in \n     the performance of any sterilization procedure or abortion if \n     the performance or assistance in the performance of such \n     procedures or abortion by such personnel would be contrary to \n     the religious beliefs or moral convictions of such personnel. \n     Or discriminate in the employment, promotion, or termination \n     of employment of any physician or other health care \n     personnel, or discriminate in the extension of staff or other \n     privileges to any physician or other health care personnel, \n     because he performed or assisted in the performance of a \n     lawful sterilization procedure or abortion, because he \n     refused to perform or assist in the performance of such a \n     procedure or abortion on the grounds that his performance or \n     assistance in the performance of the procedure or abortion \n     would be contrary to his religious beliefs or moral \n     convictions, or because of his religious beliefs or moral \n     convictions respecting sterilization procedures or abortions.\n       It is not just the Federal law that offers protections. As \n     you can see on this chart, some 46 States--almost every one \n     of them--have enacted their own conscience clauses for \n     doctors and providers who don't want to provide abortions.\n       Some are claiming that Weldon is simply a clarification of \n     current law. I find that amazing, given that it takes hours \n     for even the most seasoned attorneys and lawmakers to make \n     any sense of this provision. There is nothing clarifying \n     about it.\n       Weldon is a giant loophole that effectively bars federal, \n     state, and local governments from enforcing laws protecting \n     the reproductive health of women.\n       Most Americans, including most people of faith, believe \n     that we need to strike the right balance between honoring \n     personal beliefs and protecting the public at large.\n       In one survey, 89 percent of people said they oppose \n     allowing insurance companies to refuse to pay for medical \n     services on religious grounds.\n       Weldon takes it a step further, allowing any insurance \n     company, HMO, or other entity to refuse to provide services \n     or referrals on any grounds, and in any circumstances, even \n     if a woman's life is in danger.\n       Late last week, Rev. Carlton Veazey, the president of the \n     Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice, brought me 2,000 \n     petitions from people of faith in all 50 States.\n       These petitions said that, ``Weldon is not just bad law, it \n     is immoral law, dangerous law, and women will be hurt by it, \n     some perhaps even killed by it.''\n       What do our consciences say about that?\n       What do our consciences say about helping the thousands of \n     women who become pregnant as a result of rape each year? The \n     Weldon amendment makes no exceptions for them, or for women \n     whose lives are in serious danger.\n       Weldon tells our State and local governments that they can \n     not ensure that any woman, including victims of rape and \n     incest, receive abortion referrals and services without \n     losing all their Federal health, education, and labor \n     funding.\n       Weldon tells our State and local governments that their \n     title X clinics no longer\n\n[[Page S4222]]\n\n     have to refer a poor woman who asks about an abortion, even \n     if she has been raped or her life is in danger.\n       Weldon tells our State and local governments that they \n     should no longer honor the Hyde amendment, which provides \n     Medicaid coverage for low-income women who are victims of \n     rape or incest, or whose lives are in danger.\n       Here is what the Hyde amendment says:\n\n       None of the funds appropriated under this Act, and none of \n     the funds in any trust fund to which funds are appropriated \n     under this Act, shall be expended for any abortion. . . .\n       The limitations established in the preceding section shall \n     not apply to an abortion (1) if the pregnancy is the result \n     of an act of rape or incest; or (2) in the case where a woman \n     suffers from a physical disorder, physical injury, or \n     physical illness, including a life-endangering physical \n     condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself, \n     that would, as certified by a physician, place the woman in \n     danger of death unless an abortion is performed. . . .\n\n       What if a poor woman is raped by her uncle? Say she does \n     not have a job. She relies on Medicaid for her health care. \n     She is not told about the option of emergency contraception \n     and becomes pregnant.\n       What if she cannot emotionally bear to give birth to her \n     relative's child--her rapist's child?\n       Under the Hyde amendment we say Medicaid must pay for her \n     abortion if she is the victim of rape or incest. But, under \n     Weldon, that is no longer the case.\n       What if she goes to her regular Medicaid managed care \n     organization, but is never told that these services are \n     covered, and never referred anywhere else? The States can no \n     longer enforce the Hyde amendment, or even their own laws \n     helping rape and incest victims.\n       What do our consciences say about helping women who will \n     die without emergency abortions?\n       Weldon has no exceptions for women whose lives are in \n     danger.\n       It tells States that they cannot enforce laws ensuring that \n     poor women who face life-threatening situations will receive \n     abortion referrals or services.\n       It undermines the 1986 Federal Emergency Medical Treatment \n     and Active Labor Act, EMTALA, which says that if a pregnant \n     woman comes to a hospital with a life-threatening situation, \n     she will receive the treatment needed to be stabilized, even \n     if that includes an abortion.\n       This law states:\n\n       If any individual comes to a hospital and the hospital \n     determines that the individual has an emergency medical \n     condition, the hospital must provide . . .\n       . . .within the staff and facilities available at the \n     hospital, for such further medical examination and such \n     treatment as may be required to stabilize the medical \n     condition, . . .\n\n       A San Francisco doctor called my office to tell some of \n     these tragic stories. One of her patient's blood was not \n     clotting. She was bleeding for over an hour.\n       If she had been sent home or encouraged to continue her \n     pregnancy, she would have likely died. Thankfully, she got \n     care.\n       Another woman, a married mother, came to the hospital with \n     an ectopic pregnancy, which means the pregnancy was \n     developing in her cervix. If a woman grows a pregnancy in her \n     cervix, she can die.\n       Again, this doctor was able to save her life.\n       But, what if these woman had walked into a hospital that \n     refused to provide emergency abortions?\n       The Congress passed the Emergency Treatment and Active \n     Labor Act to ensure that no one is ever turned away if their \n     lives are in danger.\n       Now, Weldon tells a hospital or HMO to ignore this law. It \n     says they can let a woman die if they don't want to perform \n     an abortion.\n       And there is nothing States can do about it without losing \n     all their Federal labor, health, and education funding.\n       Weldon allows all health care companies to gag doctors, and \n     deny women vital information about their reproductive health \n     options.\n       Weldon tells State and local governments they can no longer \n     protect the doctor-patient relationship through Federal or \n     State laws without losing all their Federal health, \n     education, and labor funding.\n       Weldon conflicts with current title X Federal regulations, \n     which require family planning clinics to:\n\n       Offer pregnant women the opportunity to be provided \n     information and counseling regarding each of the following \n     options:\n       (A) Prenatal care and delivery;\n       (B) Infant care, foster care, or adoption; and\n       (C) Pregnancy termination.\n       (ii) If requested to provide such information and \n     counseling, provide neutral, factual information and \n     nondirective counseling on each of the options, and referral \n     upon request, except with respect to any option(s) about \n     which the pregnant woman indicates she does not wish to \n     receive such information and counseling.\n       Under Weldon, a title X clinic can take our funding, but \n     refuse to give women information. Think about what this could \n     mean for the poor women who rely on these clinics.\n       Last year, a married Latina woman in her early 30s came to \n     one of our title X family planning clinics in Los Angeles. \n     She had two children under six.\n       She had been to the clinic before because her husband is \n     unfaithful. He had infected her with severe STDs.\n       When she became pregnant again, she was very scared about \n     having the baby. Her home life was extremely unstable, and \n     she was worried about the impact of STDs on the fetus.\n       She made the extremely difficult decision to have an \n     abortion. She asked the clinic to refer her. It did. That was \n     the law.\n       But now Weldon is in direct conflict with this Federal \n     regulation saying that title X family planning clinics that \n     serve poor women must give them a referral if asked.\n       Now clinics can ignore this law. Women can be left without \n     information. And States have no power to act.\n       The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \n     says:\n       The Federal refusal clause would jeopardize a physician's \n     ability to inform a patient of all her legal medical options \n     at federally funded Title X family planning clinics, and \n     would categorize the Title X referral requirement as \n     discriminatory--effectively gagging physicians across the \n     country.\n       According to ACOG ethical guidelines, ``Under all \n     conditions of practice . . . consultation and referral should \n     be carried out in the patients' best interest.''\n       Weldon is not in the patient's best interest. It allows \n     title X clinics, HMOs, and anyone else to deny our health \n     care professionals their right to free speech and their \n     patients the right to full information about their options.\n       If States try to enforce their own laws, they could lose \n     billions of dollars in Federal labor, health, and education \n     funding. For example:\n       All 50 States have the power to ensure that hospital \n     mergers don't undermine the public interest. In some cases, \n     an attorney general might determine that, for a merger to go \n     forward, the two parties must find some way to protect the \n     reproductive health care of women.\n       The Indiana supreme court has held that limits on State \n     medical assistance for abortion in cases of life \n     endangerment, rape or incest are unconstitutional under the \n     State constitution because they do not include exceptions for \n     women's health.\n       The New Mexico supreme court held that a regulation \n     limiting medical assistance for abortion in cases of life \n     endangerment, rape or incest is unconstitutional under the \n     New Mexico constitution.\n       A court in Illinois has held that under a law limiting \n     State medical assistance for abortion to cases of life \n     endangerment is unconstitutional, under the constitution of \n     Illinois.\n       Under Weldon, States face a Hobson's choice between denying \n     reproductive health services and information to women or \n     losing billions of dollars in Federal labor, health, and \n     education funding.\n       They are told they have to ignore their constitutions, to \n     ignore Federal law and State law. They are told they no \n     longer can find creative ways to ensure women's health.\n       In New Jersey, a court approved an arrangement that set \n     aside some of the assets of a secular hospital prior to its \n     acquisition by a Catholic hospital.\n       The assets were meant to support the continuation of the \n     secular hospital's mission of providing reproductive health \n     services, which it would not be able to fulfill after the \n     merger.\n       Now, New Jersey can no longer enforce this arrangement \n     without risking more than $7 billion in Federal funding.\n       Now, some say that States are free to enforce laws \n     protecting reproductive health. They say States can do \n     whatever they want if they just give up Federal funds. Sure.\n       Let's look at what States would lose. And, keep in mind: \n     these numbers are very conservative.\n       This chart has California losing at least $37 billion in \n     Federal funding, but our Attorney General has put the number \n     at $49 billion.\n       No State can afford to give up substantial resources that \n     help educate and care for its children, provide for and train \n     its workers, and bring health care to all its citizens.\n       This is not about choice, it is about coercion.\n       That is one of the many reasons why the California attorney \n     general has sued in Federal court, a lawsuit that I believe \n     will prevail.\n       The suit says the Weldon amendment is unconstitutional \n     because it restricts a woman's right to abortion when \n     necessary to preserve her life or health.\n       It says that Weldon exceeds Congress's spending power \n     because it is so vague.\n       In South Dakota v. Dole, 1987, the court said that when \n     ``Congress desires to condition the States' receipt of \n     federal funds, `it must do so unambiguously , enable[ing] the \n     States to exercise their choice knowingly, cognizant of the \n     consequences of their participation.'''\n       Another lawsuit filed in the District of Columbia on behalf \n     of health care clinics makes the same claim. It says: ``The \n     amendment `leaves Title X grantees to guess how to meet \n     Weldon's mandate while meeting the mandates of [Title X \n     regulations], and, indeed, whether this is even possible.'''\n       If States aren't sure how to comply with Weldon, they \n     cannot make a knowing choice. And, with the amount of funding \n     at stake, they are bound to err on the side of extreme \n     caution, thereby creating a chilling effect.\n       The California lawsuit says that Federal funding conditions \n     must be rationally related to the Federal interest in the \n     program receiving them.\n\n[[Page S4223]]\n\n       What does unemployment insurance or No Child Left Behind \n     funds have to do with reproductive health?\n       Nothing. But the penalties under Weldon are so \n     unconstitutionally extreme and coercive that States have no \n     choice but to comply.\n       This amendment is unconstitutional and dangerous.\n       It is not a conscience clause. We already have that.\n       It is a denial clause that will cause unnecessary hardship \n     for victims of rape, women whose lives are in danger, poor \n     women who rely on their doctors for information, and States \n     that will be forced to choose between protecting women and \n     losing billions of dollars in funds.\n       If the Senate wants a new conscience clause, we can draft a \n     real conscience clause.\n       I will work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \n     to do just that.\n       But I will not back down until we alter or repeal the \n     Weldon language as written and do right by the women, \n     doctors, and States across America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/25/senate-section/article/S4223-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:45 A.M.
