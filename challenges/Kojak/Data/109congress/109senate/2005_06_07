Mr. President, on Wednesday, I will have the honor of \nmeeting with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan here in the \nCapitol. We will be meeting to discuss the importance of the United \nStates-Turkish relationship and the ways in which we can strengthen \nthat bond to achieve our common goals. I have had the opportunity to \nmeet with the Prime Minister twice before over the past 12 months.\n  During a trip to the Middle East this spring, I sat down with Prime \nMinister Erdogan in Jerusalem. Prior to that, we met in Istanbul in the \nsummer of 2004.\n  I look forward to continuing our dialog on the importance of the \nTurkish-American relationship. Turkey is a critical NATO ally and an \nindispensable partner in the global war on terror.\n  Despite our two countries' strong ties and close cooperation, there \nhave been strains in the recent past that began with the liberation of \nIraq in the spring of 2003. Some in the press speculate that Istanbul \nand Washington are going their separate ways. This is simply not the \ncase.\n  It is true that March of 2003, the Turkish parliament rejected our \nrequest to permit the deployment of U.S. troops to Turkey in order to \nopen a northern front against Saddam's forces. Clearly, we were not \npleased. However, Turkey's subsequent offer to send troops to Iraq and \nPresident Bush's visit to Turkey last June moved our partnership beyond \nthat matter.\n  Turkey has granted coalition forces overflight rights through Turkish \nairspace throughout the war in Iraq and has permitted the use of its \nports, airbases, and roads for resupplying coalition troops an \nsupporting reconstruction efforts in Iraq. Because of its proximity, \nTurkey's Incirlik airbase has also served as a vital transit location \nfor coalition troops rotating in and out of Iraq. In fact, from January \nto April 2004, half of all U.S. troops rotating in and out of Iraq went \nthrough Incirlik, and Turkey recently agreed to allow coalition forces \nto use the base as a logistics hub. Turkey's assistance and support has \nbeen invaluable.\n  Turkey has also been a leader in Iraq's reconstruction efforts. At \nthe\n\n[[Page S6116]]\n\n2003 Madrid donors' conference, Turkey generously pledged to donate $50 \nmillion in aid over 5 years. In addition, Turkish businesses are \nfunctioning in Iraq and helping to provide fuel, electricity, and water \nto the Iraqi people. And many brave Turkish men and women have given \nthe ultimate sacrifice to help build Iraq's nascent democracy. We honor \nthem for their courage.\n  Turkey's contribution to the reconstruction project in Afghanistan \nmust also not be overlooked. Turkey has taken the lead for the \nInternational Security Assistance Force twice in the last 3 years, most \nrecently in February of this year.\n  And we must not forget that Turkey had been challenged by terrorism \nat home by the PKK for years before 9/11. Turkey is threatened today as \nwell. Some PKK terrorists are seeking safe haven in northern Iraq, and \nso I urge the administration and the Iraqi government to take more \naggressive action against the terrorists, and deny them any safe haven \nfrom which to launch attacks.\n  Since 9/11, Turkey has also been the target of al-Qaida. In November \n2003, 62 people were killed and more than 700 injured in multiple \nbombings in Istanbul. It was a tragic event that saddened and angered \nthe world, and fortified our resolve to win the war on terror.\n  Turkey has been a dedicated and reliable ally. Our intelligence \ncommunities are in close contact in this war, and Turkey has been \ninstrumental in capturing terrorists, disrupting their logistics and \nplanning, and dismantling their vast financial networks.\n  I am confident that Turkey will remain determined and resolute in the \nwar on terror, and that enhanced cooperation between our two countries \nwill prove to be fruitful. Turkey's role as a vital and strategic ally \ncan only be enhanced by its membership in the European Union. The \nUnited States strongly supports this.\n  On December 17 last year, EU member states accepted the \nrecommendation of the European commission for the commencement of \naccession negotiations with Turkey. These talks are scheduled to begin \nin October. In order to reach this stage, the Turkish government has \nundertaken sweeping reforms to fulfill the political and economic \ncriteria for membership in the EU.\n  Since October of 2001, the Turkish parliament has passed nine reform \npackages to bring Turkish laws into line with EU benchmarks--five under \nthe leadership of Prime Minister Endrogan. Reforms include the \nlegalization of Kurdish broadcasting and education, the enhancement of \nfreedoms of speech and association, greater civilian control over the \nmilitary, and more thorough and transparent investigations into \nallegations of human rights abuses. It is crucial that Turkey continue \nto take steps to meet all of the EU's criteria. This will allow the \nUnited States to remain a steady and effective supporter of Turkey's \nambitions to join the EU.\n  Turkey's accession to the EU will have a profound impact on Muslim \npopulations within Europe, in the broader Middle East and beyond. It \nwill further demonstrate that democratic governance and respect for the \nrule of law are not unique to one religion or one culture, but are the \nbirthright of all peoples everywhere. Just as the people of Iraq, \nLebanon, and Afghanistan are setting a remarkable example for the \nentire Middle East, Turkey's membership in the EU will inspire hope \nthroughout the entire Muslim world.\n  And, finally, as a secular democracy with a predominantly Muslim \npopulation, Turkey's membership in the EU--as in NATO--will demonstrate \nthe United States' and Europe's commitment to diversity and tolerance.\n  We may not always agree on the same course of action--and sometimes \nwe may not agree on the same ends--but Turkey has, for decades, been a \nfriend. And it has consistently expressed its dedication to the values, \nideals, and interests that the United States holds dear.\n  Like the United States, Turkey is committed to a democratic Iraq that \nrespects the rights of its own people and is at peace with its \nneighbors. It is committed to a just resolution to the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict in which two democratic states, Israel and \nPalestine, live side-by-side in peace and security. It stands against \nIran's nuclear ambitions, and squarely for victory in the war against \nterror.\n  The United States and Turkey share the same objectives: peace, \nsecurity, and the spread of freedom and opportunity.\n  The partnership between the United States and Turkey has survived \ndisagreements in the past and has been consistently vital in the \npursuit of our shared interests. The key has always been strong \nleadership at the highest levels that articulates our partnership and \ndefends the bilateral ties that help us advance our common goals.\n  Today, we face a golden opportunity to move beyond recent tensions \nand strengthen our partnership. The first step is for Prime Minister \nErdogan to speak clearly in defense of our partnership, and to dispel a \nwave of anti-Americanism that runs counter to the last 5 decades of \ncooperation.\n  I'm confident that the prime minister will do so during his visit \nthis week, and when he returns home to Turkey. And I'm confident that \nthe United States-Turkish partnership will endure as we confront the \nchallenges of the 21st century together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I seek recognition under the terms of that order.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois, the \nassistant Democratic leader, is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am sorry that this day has come. Janice \nRogers Brown is one of President Bush's most ideological and extreme \njudicial nominees. This is not just my opinion. I invite anyone, \nplease, read her speeches, read her opinions. They reflect the views of \na judicial activist and a person who is, in fact, an ideological \nwarrior. They reflect the views of someone who is outside of the \nmainstream of American thought. They reflect the views of someone who \nshould not be given a lifetime appointment to the second highest court \nin America--a court second only to the United States Supreme Court.\n  I am a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I served as the \nranking Democrat at Justice Brown's hearing in October of 2003. I asked \nher a lot of questions. Her answers offered little assurance that she \nwill be anything but a judicial activist with a far-right agenda.\n\n[[Page S6117]]\n\n  She is a very engaging person. She has a great life story. You cannot \nhelp but like her when you first meet her. But then, as you read what \nshe has said and ask her questions about it, you cannot help but be \ntroubled, if you are looking for someone who is moderate and centrist \nand who will be fair in the way they view the most important cases \ncoming before the court.\n  Do not take my word for that. Listen to the words of George Will, one \nof the most well-known, conservative voices in America. Two weeks ago \nin the Washington Post, George Will wrote the following:\n\n       Janice Rogers Brown is out of that mainstream. That should \n     not be an automatic disqualification, but it is a fact: She \n     has expressed admiration for the Supreme Court's pre-1937 \n     hyper-activism in declaring unconstitutional many laws and \n     regulations of the sort that now define the new post-New Deal \n     regulatory state.\n\n  I agree with George Will. So do hundreds of other individuals and \norganizations. Newspaper editorial boards across America are deeply \ntroubled about her nomination by President Bush.\n  Justice Brown's ideological rants about the role of government in our \nsociety are found most often in her speeches. She called the year of \n1937 ``the triumph of our own socialist revolution.'' Socialism in \nAmerica, in the eyes of Justice Brown. Why? Because the Supreme Court \ndecisions that year upheld the constitutionality of Social Security and \nother major parts of the New Deal. So in the eyes of Justice Brown, the \nNew Deal and Social Security are socialist ideas? That shows how far \nremoved she is from the reality of thinking in America.\n  She stated:\n\n       Where Government moves in, community retreats, civil \n     society disintegrates, and our ability to control our own \n     destiny atrophies.\n\n  That is a wonderful line to throw in a novel but to announce that as \nyour philosophy as you take off to preside over a bench making \ndecisions involving the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans is \njust too extreme.\n  Justice Brown has praised an infamous case, Lochner v. New York. It \nis a 100-year-old case. The Supreme Court struck down maximum-hour laws \nfor bakers and ruled that Government regulations interfered with the \nconstitutional right to ``freedom of contract.'' The Lochner case has \nbeen repudiated by both liberals and conservatives. They said it went \ntoo far. They believed it was extreme, but not Justice Brown. She not \nonly accepts the Lochner decision, she embraces it.\n  In another speech, Justice Brown said our Federal Government is like \nslavery. She said:\n\n       We no longer find slavery abhorrent. We embrace it. We \n     demand more. Big government is not just the opiate of the \n     masses. It is the opiate.\n\n  Think about these words. Interesting things to read. You might want \nto read them from time to time and say, let's see what the far right \nthinks about things, except these are the words of a woman who is \nseeking to bring her views to a lifetime appointment on the Federal \nbench.\n  She has blasted Government programs that help seniors, and here is \nwhat she said:\n\n       Today's senior citizens blithely cannibalize their \n     grandchildren because they have a right to get as much \n     ``free'' stuff as the political system will permit them to \n     extract.\n\n  Think about that. Think of the cynicism in that remark and think \nabout whether she is the judge you would want to face with a critical \ndecision involving your life, your family, your community, or our \ncountry--Janice Rogers Brown.\n  She rebuked elected officials for ``handing out new rights like \nlollipops in the dentist's office.'' She has complained that ``in the \nlast 100 years, and particularly in the last 30, the Constitution has \nbeen demoted to the status of a bad chain novel.''\n  Think about that. Is Roe v. Wade chapter 1 of Justice Brown's bad \nchain novel? How about Brown v. Board of Education, Justice Brown? Is \nthat another bad chapter in America's novel? How about Miranda, a \ndecision which has now been accepted across America, another bad \nchapter in America's novel?\n  Justice Brown just does not get it. America has changed, thank God, \nin recognizing the right of privacy, in recognizing that we are putting \nbehind us segregation, separate but equal schools, in recognizing that \nwhen it comes to the power of the State, there are limitations and \nthere are rights of individuals. For Justice Brown, these are part of a \nbad chain novel. What a choice of words.\n  Justice Brown's rhetoric suggests she is guided more by ``The \nFountainhead,'' ``Atlas Shrugged,'' and ``The Road to Serfdom'' than by \nour Constitution and Bill of Rights. And she wants a lifetime \nappointment on the bench?\n  The Washington Post asked a question in an editorial this morning of \nRepublicans in the Senate: If you truly want moderate people who are \nnot activist, who do not come to the bench with an agenda, how can you \nsupport Justice Brown? When you take a look at what she has done and \nsaid, how can you honestly believe she is going to be moderate in her \napproach on the bench?\n  The question is whether Republican Senators will march in lockstep \nbecause President Bush says take it or leave it. It is Justice Janice \nRogers Brown, you have to have her. If they take it, they are basically \nturning their backs on the fact they have argued against activism on \nthe bench. Hers is activism from the right, not from the left. But if \nyou are opposed to judicial activism, how could you support her based \non what she said?\n  In her confirmation hearing, Justice Brown dismissed her speeches. \nShe said they were just an attempt to stir the pot. They did more than \nstir the pot. They set the kitchen on fire. Her speeches show she has \nthe temperament and ideology of a rightwing radio talk show host, not \nof a person we want to serve on the second highest court of the land \nfor a lifetime--a lifetime.\n  Justice Brown's nomination to the DC Circuit of all courts is \nparticularly troubling. The DC Circuit is a unique court. It is the \ncourt that most closely oversees the operations of Government, such as \ndealing with worker safety and unfair labor practices. It is the only \nappellate court with exclusive jurisdiction over many aspects of \nenvironmental and energy laws. How ironic and unfortunate to have \nsomeone considered for that position who is so openly hostile to the \nrole of the Government when it comes to the environment, when it comes \nto protecting individual rights.\n\n  As a member of the California Supreme Court, Justice Brown has put \nher theories into practice. In case after case, Justice Brown has sided \nwith anti-Government positions, and she has sided consistently against \nvictims seeking rights and remedies. She is a tough judge. Sometimes \nyou want a tough judge, but you also want a balanced judge, one who is \ngoing to be fair in what they do on the bench.\n  Oftentimes she is the loan dissenter--remarkable--because the \nCalifornia Supreme Court has six Republicans and only one Democrat. \nSenator Barbara Boxer of California has counted at least 31 cases where \nJustice Brown was the sole dissenter. Let me give a few examples.\n  She was the only member of the California Supreme Court to find the \nCalifornia Fair Employment and Housing Commission did not have the \nauthority to award damages to housing discrimination victims.\n  She was the only member of the court to conclude that age \ndiscrimination victims should not have the right to sue under common \nlaw, an interpretation directly contrary to the will of the California \nLegislature.\n  She was the only member of the California Supreme Court who voted to \nstrike down a San Francisco law that provided housing assistance to \ndisplaced low-income, elderly, and disabled people.\n  In a case last year, Justice Brown was the sole member of her court \nwho voted to strike down a law that required health insurance plans \nthat cover prescription drugs to include prescription contraceptives in \nthat coverage. Her open hostility to access to contraception is \nparticularly worth noting today, June 7, 2005. Today is the 40th \nanniversary of the landmark Supreme Court case Griswold v. Connecticut, \nwhich established a constitutional right to marital privacy. That case \nreally was a watershed decision.\n  In the State of Connecticut and several other States, a religious \ngroup had been successful in convincing the State\n\n[[Page S6118]]\n\nlegislature to dramatically limit the availability of birth control and \ncontraception. Forty years ago, some of us did not know it was \nhappening, but it was happening. In some States, you could not buy \nbirth control because the legislature said no. That is a decision the \nState had decided that you could not make as an individual.\n  The Griswold case overthrew that law and said that your personal \nright to privacy trumped State rights when it came to access to \ncontraception.\n  It turns out that Justice Brown's hostility to access to \ncontraception runs counter to 40 years of thinking in America about our \nrights as individuals to privacy and to make those decisions involving \npersonal responsibility. Justice Janice Rogers Brown might take that \nright away.\n  To reward her for this extreme and fringe view, President Bush wants \nto give her a lifetime appointment to the second highest court of the \nland. There she will sit day after day, week after week, and month \nafter month making decisions that affect the lives of individuals. It \nis her point of view that will prevail. She has shown no inclination \ntoward moderation. She will push that agenda on that court, and people \nwill come into that courtroom and wonder what country they are living \nin, where this court might be meeting because it is so inconsistent \nwith what America has stood for.\n  In another case, Justice Brown was the only member of the California \nSupreme Court who voted to make it easier to sell cigarettes to minors. \nIsn't that perfect? She wants the Government to invade your privacy \nwhen it comes to the decisions about birth control and your family, but \nshe does not want the Government to stop the gas station down the \nstreet from selling cigarettes to a 12-year-old.\n  She was the only member of her court who dissented in two rulings \nthat permitted counties to ban guns or gun sales on fairgrounds or \nother public property.\n  She was the only member of her court who voted to overturn the rape \nconviction of a 17-year-old girl because she believed the victim gave \nmixed messages to the rapist. She was the only member to dissent. She \nread the facts and concluded that she sided with the rapist and not the \nvictim--the only member to dissent.\n\n  She was the only member of her court who concluded there was nothing \nimproper about requiring a criminal defendant to wear a 50,000-bolt \nstun belt at his trial--the only member of the court, a court of six \nRepublicans and one Democrat. In many of these cases, there were clear \nprecedents, decisions by the court which Justice Brown chose to ignore. \nHer personal philosophy was more important to her than the law. That is \nknown as judicial activism. That is what Republicans have condemned, \nand that is what they will endorse if they vote for her nomination.\n  Why does she ignore the law so often? It gets in the way of her \npersonal beliefs. Those are the most important things from her point of \nview.\n  This is not a new revelation about Justice Brown. Back in 1996, the \nCalifornia State Bar Commission rated Justice Brown as ``not \nqualified''--not qualified--for the California Supreme Court. Here is \nwhat they said about her: She had a tendency ``to interject her \npolitical and philosophical views into her opinions.'' No surprise. \nRead what she has done on that court. Read what she said about the law. \nAnd do not be a bit surprised when she comes to this DC Circuit Court, \nif she is approved by the Senate for a lifetime appointment, and does \nexactly the same thing. It is not as if we can say 2 years from now: \nWell, we guessed wrong; she is not independent, she is not moderate, \nshe is an activist, we will remove her. No way. This is a lifetime \nappointment to this court by the Bush administration, just the kind of \nideologue they want to put on that bench to influence decision after \ndecision as long as she lives.\n  Nine years later, the American Bar Association, in evaluating Justice \nBrown for the position we are voting on today, gave her the lowest \npassing grade. Several members of the ABA screening committee rated \nJustice Brown ``not qualified'' again.\n  In the editorial I mentioned earlier, entitled ``Reject Justice \nBrown,'' the Washington Post today asserted:\n\n       No Senator who votes for her will have standing any longer \n     to complain about legislating from the bench.\n\n  And the Washington Post is right. Do not complain about judicial \nactivism if you vote for Janice Rogers Brown. She is a judicial \nactivist. She has an agenda, and she has been loyal to it on the \nCalifornia Supreme Court. There is no reason to expect anything \ndifferent on the DC Circuit Court.\n  A Los Angeles Times editorial entitled ``A Bad Fit for a Key Court'' \nstated:\n\n       In opinions and speeches, Brown has articulated disdainful \n     views of the Constitution and Government that are so strong \n     and so far from the mainstream as to raise questions about \n     whether they would control her decisions.\n\n  That is from a Los Angeles Times editorial which, incidentally, is \nher home State newspaper. They know her best.\n  The New York Times stated that Justice Brown ``is an outspoken \nsupporter of a radical movement to take constitutional law back to \nbefore 1937, when the Federal Government had little power to prevent \ndiscrimination, protect workers from unsafe conditions or prohibit \nchild labor.''\n  The Detroit Free Press put it this way:\n\n       Since her appointment to the State court in 1996, Brown has \n     all but hung a banner above her head declaring herself a foe \n     to privacy rights, civil rights, legal precedent and even \n     colleagues who don't share her extremist leanings.\n\n  Over 100 organizations oppose Justice Brown. It takes something in \nthis town to get 100 groups to oppose someone. She pulled it off, \nincluding almost every major African-American organization in America, \ndespite the fact that Janice Rogers Brown is an African American.\n  Dr. Dorothy Height, the great civil rights leader, recipient of the \nCongressional Gold Medal, attended a press conference before the \nJudiciary Committee vote on Justice Brown in November of 2003 and said \nthis:\n\n       I cannot stand by and be silent when a jurist with the \n     record of performance of California Supreme Court Justice \n     Janice Rogers Brown is nominated to a Federal court, even \n     though she is an African-American woman. In her speeches and \n     decisions, Justice Janice Rogers Brown has articulated \n     positions that weaken the civil rights legislation and \n     progress that I and others have fought so long and hard to \n     achieve.\n\n  How hard it must have been for Dorothy Height, this great civil \nrights leader, to come out and publicly say that this African-American \nwoman, Janice Rogers Brown, was not the right choice for the DC Circuit \nCourt, the same city that Dorothy Height calls home.\n  The Senate rejected the nomination of Janice Rogers Brown in 2003. \nHer renomination this year is less about confirmation than it is about \nconfrontation. It is evident the White House wants to pick a fight over \nthis nomination. Well, they will get their wish today.\n  This White House strategy of confrontation does a great disservice to \nthe American people, who have every right to expect their elected \nrepresentatives to work together to address the real problems facing \nour Nation, rather than fighting the same battles over and over.\n  I know my colleagues across the aisle have steadfastly supported \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees, but I urge them to at least stand \nup to the President on this one.\n  I ask them to consider the story of Stephen Barnett, a distinguished \nconstitutional law professor at the University of California at \nBerkeley. Professor Barnett enthusiastically endorsed Janice Rogers \nBrown before her October 2003 hearing, and Senator Hatch specifically \nmentioned Professor Barnett and his endorsement in his opening \nstatement at Justice Brown's hearing.\n  But Professor Barnett changed his mind after he learned more about \nher record. After the Brown confirmation hearing, Professor Barnett \nsent a letter to Senator Hatch withdrawing his support. Here is what he \nsaid:\n\n       Having read the speeches of Justice Brown that have now \n     been disclosed, and having watched her testimony before the \n     Committee on October 22, I no longer support the nomination. \n     Those speeches, with their government-bashing and their \n     extreme and outdated ideological positions, put Justice Brown \n     outside the mainstream of today's constitutional law.\n\n  I urge my colleagues across the aisle, who were initially inclined to \nsupport\n\n[[Page S6119]]\n\nthe Brown nomination, like Professor Barnett, to reconsider. Federal \njudges serve for life. The views of Janice Rogers Brown are too extreme \nand too radical for a lifetime of service on the second highest court \nin America.\n  It is well known that the last time the nomination of Janice Rogers \nBrown came before the Senate, it was filibustered. I voted to continue \nthat filibuster because I do not believe she is the right person for \nthe job. There was a big controversy over the use of the filibuster, \nand a decision was reached that Janice Rogers Brown would not be \nsubject to a filibuster when she came up this week. That is an effort \nto move the Senate forward, to put the nuclear option and that \nconstitutional confrontation behind us.\n  I urge my colleagues who believe in good faith we need to be \nbipartisan to show that bipartisanship today. Take an honest look at \nher record. Understand she is not a good person for a lifetime \nappointment. Join us in defeating the nomination of Janice Rogers \nBrown.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the same subject as my \ngood colleague from Illinois. I hope everyone heard his outstanding \ncomments on Janice Rogers Brown. If there were ever a nominee who is \nout of the mainstream of every nominee of all the 219 who have come \nbefore us, there is no one more extreme than Janice Rogers Brown.\n  I have a special plea today. It is to my moderate colleagues across \nthe aisle. They have stood with their party and their President on \nwanting an up-or-down vote, but that does not mean they have to vote \nyes. If there was ever a nominee whose views are different from theirs, \nit is Janice Rogers Brown. She is so far out of the mainstream that \nconservative commentators such as George Will who have defended the \nother nominees have said that she is out of the mainstream.\n  She is so far out of the mainstream that she makes Justice Scalia \nlook like a liberal. She is so far out of the mainstream that she \nwishes to roll back not 20, not 40, not 60, not 80, but 100 years of \nlaw and jurisprudence. She is typical of the kind of nominee we should \nnot have on the bench, whether they be far right or far left, someone \nwho thinks their own views ought to take precedence over the views of \nthe law, over the views of the people, over the views of the \nlegislature and the President.\n  There is no doubt that Janice Rogers Brown is smart and accomplished. \nThere is no doubt that she rose from humble beginnings, and that is \ntruly impressive, but none of that can offset her radical and \nregressive approach to the law. None of that can mitigate her hostility \nto a host of litigants who have appeared before her. The biography, as \nwonderful as it is, is no justification to put on the courts someone \nwho clearly does not belong there. Particularly to place such a nominee \non the DC Court of Appeals, the second highest court in the land, would \nbe one of the worst wrongs we would have done in the short span of the \n21st century for which this Congress has met.\n  To my mind, Janice Rogers Brown is the least deserving of all of \nPresident Bush's appeal court nominees. Before I review the reasons I \nwill vote against her, I wish to ask a question that continues to nag \nat me. I asked it yesterday, but let me ask it again in a different way \nbecause I do not have a good answer, and I do not think there is a good \nanswer. Why are even moderate Republican Senators boarding the Brown \nbandwagon when clearly her views are so far away from what any \nmoderate, Democrat or Republican, believes? A second question: Why are \nso many self-described conservatives voting for her when she stands \nagainst all the things this conservative movement has said they believe \nin?\n  Does this nominee embody the conservative ideal of an appellate \njudge? If the rhetoric from the President and the Republican leadership \nis to be believed, a conservative nominee must be at least three \nthings: He or she must be a strict constructionist, he or she must be \njudicially restrained, and he or she must be mainstream.\n  I ask my friends on the other side of the aisle to take this little \nmultiple-choice quiz before they vote for Janice Rogers Brown. Which of \nthese describes the nominee? Is she a strict constructionist if she \nsays the whole history of the New Deal should be washed away? Is she a \nstrict constructionist if she says zoning laws, which have been with us \nfor over 100 years, are unconstitutional? Is she judicially restrained \nwhen she says that the elderly are cannibalizing the young because they \nwant benefits? Is she mainstream when she asks question after question \nand then takes views that 99.9 percent of the American people would \noppose?\n\n  I would argue, and I do not think there is very little dispute, that \nJanice Rogers Brown is not a strict constructionist, is not judicially \nrestrained, and is not mainstream.\n  Let us see if she is a proud and principled strict constructionist, \nand let us use President Bush's definition of what a strict \nconstructionist is. It is a judge who will not legislate from the \nbench. Well, Janice Rogers Brown is no more of a strict constructionist \nthan I am a starting center for the New York Knicks.\n  Listen to what a conservative commentator, Ramesh Ponnuru of the \nNational Review, wrote about her:\n\n       Republicans, and their conservative allies, have been \n     willing to make . . . lame arguments to rescue even nominees \n     whose jurisprudence is questionable. Janice Rogers Brown . . \n     . has argued that there is properly an extra constitutional \n     dimension to constitutional law. . . .\n\n  Well, I say to my conservative strict constructionist colleagues, if \nthey are opening the door to this extra constitutional dimension, they \nare going to reap what they have sown. They are going to find someone \nsooner or later put on the court who is way to the left and says there \nis an extra constitutional dimension. My guess is that some of their \nallies on the hard right already think that has happened in, say, \nJustice Kennedy's decision in Lawrence. But what is good for the goose \nis good for the gander.\n  Ponnuru goes on to write:\n\n     . . . She has said that judges should be willing to invoke a \n     ``higher law'' than the Constitution.\n\n  Let me repeat that. Janice Rogers Brown has said that judges should \nbe willing to invoke a higher law than the Constitution. Does she want \na theocracy? Does she want a dictatorship? The Constitution is our \nhighest law. We may have many other beliefs, and the Constitution \nprotects our right to practice those beliefs, but for a judge to say \nthey will invoke a higher law than the Constitution--how can any \nconservative stand here with a straight face and tell us that they are \nfor Janice Rogers Brown?\n  Let us look at her own words. Here is what she said about California \nproposition 209. She decided she should ``look to the analytical and \nphilosophical evolution of the interpretation and application of Title \nVII to develop the historical context behind proposition 209.\n  Not what the people voted for, not strict constructionism, but her \nown view.\n  Let us go to the next choice. Is she otherwise a dependable warrior \nagainst the scourge of conservatives everywhere--judicial activism? \nWell, here are her own words:\n\n       We cannot simply cloak ourselves in the doctrine of stare \n     decisis.\n       [I am] disinclined to perpetuate dubious law for no better \n     reason than it exists.\n\n  Please. This is not someone who is a strict constructionist. It is \nsomebody who is saying, with, I might say, intellectual arrogance, that \nher views supersede the views of the law. For those who did not go to \nlaw school or school where they learned Latin, ``stare decisis'' means \ndecisions that have been already made by the courts, and they imply a \ngrand tradition often going back to England and Anglo-Saxon law to the \n1200s.\n  We cannot cloak ourselves in the doctrine of stare decisis? Again, \nwhat does Janice Rogers Brown want to be nominated for--dictator or \ngrand exalted ruler? Please. How can a conservative who believes we are \nto follow the rule of law, who believes that there should be strict \nconstructionism and is against activist judges, support someone who \nsays, ``I am disinclined to perpetuate dubious law for no better reason \nthan it exists''?\n  What arrogance. What gall. And most importantly, why would we even \nthink--why did President Bush think and why do my colleagues think--of\n\n[[Page S6120]]\n\nputting someone on the bench who says that? Whether you are the most \nconservative Republican or the most moderate Republican, whether you \nare the most liberal Democrat or the most moderate Democrat, we don't \nbelieve this. None of us believe this. This is against our entire \nAmerican tradition, from the Magna Carta, through common law, through \nour Constitution, through the next wonderful 200 years.\n  The California State Bar Judicial Nominees Commission, which gave her \na ``nonqualified'' rating when she was first nominated to the court in \n1996, said that the rating was in part because of complaints that she \nwas ``insensitive to legal precedent.''\n  Here is what Andrew Sullivan says, another conservative writer. This \nis not Chuck Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, NY. This is Andrew \nSullivan, conservative writer. He said there is a very good case to be \nmade for the:\n\n      . . . constitutional extremism of one of the president's \n     favorite nominees, Janice Rogers Brown. Whatever else she is, \n     she does not fit the description of a judge who simply \n     applies the law. If she isn't a ``judicial activist,'' I \n     don't know who would be.\n\n  My colleagues, whether you are here in the Senate or out in the \nconservative movement, you spent a 20-year battle fighting judicial \nactivism, but all of a sudden you are saying: Never mind. If we like \nthe views of the nominee, strict construction goes out the window, and \nwe will put in our own variety of judicial activist.\n  That is not going to bode well for consistency in your arguments, but \nmore importantly for the Republic, and for the keystone of article 3, \nthe article 3 branch of Government, the judiciary, which is that judges \ninterpret the law and follow the precedent of law and do not make law.\n  Mr. Ponnuru, the National Review writer, said:\n\n       She has said that judicial activism is not troubling per \n     se. . . .\n\n  Here is the point of Mr. Sullivan, who was the author of this other \nquote. He said:\n\n       I might add, I am not unsympathetic to her . . . views. But \n     she should run for office, not the courts.\n\n  I couldn't say it better myself. This is somebody who has such \npassionate views that she has to take those views, which are so \nradically different--our Constitution says our way of governing is you \ndo not do that from the bench. You do it by running for office.\n  My guess is if she actually ran for office--of course she ran for \njudge, but she was unopposed. I am sure if right now you asked the \npeople of California, Who is Janice Rogers Brown, maybe 3 or 4 percent \nwould know and they might not know her views.\n  You run for office.\n  What about her substantive views, are they mainstream? To call \nJustice Brown mainstream is a distortion of her record. No one is \nfurther from the mainstream. I cannot think of a single Clinton nominee \nwho is as far to the left as Janice Rogers Brown is to the right. I \ncannot think of a single George Bush nominee, George Bush 41; I cannot \nthink of a single Ronald Reagan nominee; I cannot think of a single \nnominee, in at least my lifetime, who is more out of the mainstream \nthan Janice Rogers Brown.\n  But don't take my word for it. How about George Will--hardly a \nleftwing liberal--on the approach of this nominee? Here is what he \nsaid:\n\n       Janice Rogers Brown is out of the mainstream of \n     conservative jurisprudence.\n       It is a fact: She has expressed admiration for the Supreme \n     Court's pre-1937 hyper-activism in declaring unconstitutional \n     many laws and regulations of the sort that now define the \n     post-New Deal regulatory state.\n\n  There may be some people who feel we should go back before the New \nDeal, where the rich and powerful got their way almost all the time. \nBut, again, as was said by Andrew Sullivan, if she believes that, let \nher run for office. But here is the dirty little secret of those on the \nhard right who believe, as Janice Rogers Brown does, that the New Deal \nwas wrong, the Commerce Clause should be dismantled and wages and hours \nlaws are unconstitutional. The dirty little secret is they know they \ncannot win in the court of public opinion, and their plan is to impose \ntheir views on the rest of us by capturing the judiciary. Nobody--\nnobody personifies those views more than Janice Rogers Brown.\n  Let me go over a few other of her views before I conclude. She has \ndescribed the New Deal as the ``triumph'' of America's ``socialist \nrevolution.'' Does that place her in the mainstream?\n  She has said the Lochner case--which said basically that wage-and-\nhours laws passed by the States are unconstitutional--was correct. Does \nthat place her in the mainstream, taking a case from 1906 that has been \nrepudiated from the 1930s onward and saying that it was correctly \ndecided?\n  On another occasion she said that:\n\n       Today's senior citizens blithely cannibalize their \n     grandchildren because they have a right to get as much free \n     stuff as the political system will permit.\n\n  I would like the senior citizens of America, whether they be liberal \nDemocrats or conservative Republicans, to answer the question: Is she \nout of the mainstream? By getting Social Security, is she asking are \nthey cannibalizing the young? Or Medicare? Because I don't know what \nother benefits senior citizens get.\n  Janice Rogers Brown, by this quote, seems to believe we should not \nhave Social Security. It is probably part of the New Deal Socialist \nrevolution. We should not have Medicare. That is part of Lyndon \nJohnson's furtherance of the Socialist revolution. How mainstream is \nthat?\n  Again, I want to ask my moderate colleagues--not only the 7 who \nsigned the document but the 10 or 12 others--how can you vote for her? \nI mean, I understand marching in lockstep. I understand we are going to \nhave different views on a whole lot of judges. But how about once--once \nshowing a little independence. Because I know that Janice Rogers \nBrown's views are not your views. She is not nominated for a district \ncourt. She is nominated for the second highest court in the land, where \nthose views will be heard over and over and over again.\n  I am left with the same question. It is clear that her record shows \nshe is not strict in her constructionism; she is not mainstream in her \nconservatism; and she is not quiet about her activism. Again, let me \nask the question: Why is Janice Rogers Brown touted as the model of a \nconservative judge when she is anything but conservative in her \njudicial approach?\n  I believe there are many Senators across the aisle who would vote \nagainst such a candidate because her judicial philosophy could not be \nmore out of sync with theirs. But we know there is tremendous political \npressure, party pressure on the moderate Senators.\n  We have a new chart because we have had a few new votes. Of all the \nvotes we have had on judicial nominees, cloture and up-or-down votes, \nhere is how the Republican side of the aisle has stacked up: 2,811 to \n2. Only twice in all the votes, 2,813, has any Member of the other side \nvoted against; once, when Trent Lott voted against Judge Gregory, and \njust last week on Justice Owen, Senator Chafee voted against her.\n  If we want up-or-down votes, doesn't that imply some independence of \nthought? Doesn't that imply we not march in lockstep? Doesn't that \nimply, when somebody is so far out of the mainstream, such as Janice \nRogers Brown, that there will be some opposition to her from the other \nside of the aisle?\n  Senator Frist, last week, or a few weeks ago, spoke about leader-led \nfilibusters of judges--whatever that means. Is the vote for Janice \nRogers Brown not a leader-led rubberstamping of nominees, nominees who \nhave not even convinced conservatives that they belong on the bench?\n  I continue to believe Judge Brown was the least worthy pick this \nPresident has made in the appellate courts, and that is based on her \nrecord--not her background, not her story, not her race, not her \ngender. We should vote for judges based on their record, and I, once \nagain, ask my colleagues across the aisle to look at that record.\n  If my colleagues across the aisle ask three simple questions--Is the \nnominee a strict constructionist? Is the nominee a judicial activist? \nAnd is the nominee a mainstream conservative?--I don't believe many \ncould bring themselves to vote for Janice Rogers Brown.\n  I could not support Judge Brown's nomination the first time. I cannot \nsupport it now. I urge my colleagues, particularly my moderate friends \nfrom the other side of the aisle, to vote against her this afternoon.\n\n[[Page S6121]]\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum and I ask the \ntime of the quorum be charged equally to each side as the quorum moves \nforward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to share a few thoughts \nabout the nomination of Janice Rogers Brown, one of the best \nnominations the President has made. She is a woman of integrity and \nability, with proven skill as an appellate jurist. She has won the \nsupport and admiration of her colleagues on the California appellate \ncourts with whom she served and has won the support of the people of \nCalifornia, as evidenced by her being reelected to the California \nSupreme Court with 76 percent of the vote.\n  What do we hear from my colleague, the great advocate that he is, and \nmy friend, Senator Schumer? It is sad. He uses words of radicalism to \ndeclare that she is outside the mainstream. He says she is far over and \nout of the mainstream; her radical and regressive approach to the law \nis so off the charts; she expresses hostility to a host of litigants; \nthe most out of the mainstream; a radical. Everything she believes in \nis what they believe--he is talking about President Bush, I suppose, \nand Republicans. He says she is no more a strict constructionist than \nhe is a second baseman for the New York Yankees. This morning he said \nthat she is no more a strict constructionist than he is a center for \nthe New York Jets.\n  Saying it does not make it so. There has been a systematic effort--\nand I have watched with amazement--to declare this fine justice on the \nCalifornia Supreme Court an extremist. Get past the allegations of \nextremism, the charges, and the mud throwing--extremist, radical, out \nof the mainstream. This morning, Senator Schumer used words that were \ninteresting: Did she want to be a dictator? What in her record \nindicates she wants to be a dictator?\n  Then he said this: Did she want to be a grand exalted ruler? Was that \nsome reference to the Ku Klux Klan? This African American from my home \nState of Alabama left as a teenager. I am sure one reason she went to \nCalifornia was for discrimination and segregation that existed in rural \nAlabama where she grew up at that time. She is the daughter of \nsharecroppers. To have it suggested that somehow her ideas are \nconsistent with the Ku Klux Klan is offensive. It ought to be offensive \nto Americans.\n  Where is the meat? What is it that shows Justice Brown is not fair, \nthat she is incapable? I don't see it. As a matter of fact, they have \nexamined her record in great detail, every speech she has given, \neverything she has done in her life, remarks she has made, opinions she \nhas written. She is a restrained jurist, respected by her colleagues \nand the people before whom she practices. She is one of the most \ndeserving nominees. I am proud of her. I am proud she came from \nAlabama. I am sorry she left the State of Alabama. I am proud of what \nshe has accomplished in the State of California.\n  She currently serves as an associate justice on the California \nSupreme Court and has held that job since 1996. Prior to that, she \nserved for 2 years as an associate on the Third District Court of \nAppeals.\n  Let me add, if she is such a radical dictator, grand exalted ruler, \nif that is her mentality and way of doing business, would every member \nof the Third District Court of Appeals with whom she served and four of \nher six fellow justices on the California Supreme Court write a letter \nto Senator Hatch, then Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nsaying to confirm this wonderful woman, asking that she be confirmed, \nand saying glowing things about her? One of the justices on the \nCalifornia Supreme Court who supports her is Justice Stanley Mosk, one \nof the most liberal justices in America, recognized in that vein \nthroughout the country. Why would Justice Mosk and the others support \nJanice Rogers Brown if she is such an out-of-the-mainstream radical \njustice? The truth is, she is not. This has been conjured up by certain \ngroups, left-wing attack groups who have been smearing and besmirching \nand sullying the reputation of excellent nominees for many years. It is \nnot right what is being done to this lady. She is a person of sterling \ncharacter. She writes beautifully. She is respected by her colleagues. \nShe is very much appreciated by the people of California. Four judges \nwere on the ballot when she ran for reelection, and she got the highest \nnumber of votes of any.\n  We have Senators from California telling us she is out of the \nmainstream. Maybe she believes in carrying out the duly elected death \npenalty statutes of California. Maybe she believes the constitutional \namendment they passed, Proposition 209, ought to be enforced. Maybe she \nbelieves the Pledge of Allegiance shouldn't be struck down as \nunconstitutional. Maybe that is what they want. Maybe that is what they \nthink is a mainstream judge. I don't think she is there. She is the \nkind of judge President Bush promised to appoint. It was an important \nissue in this past election. The people of America debated and \ndiscussed it and spoke clearly in the reelection of President Bush that \nthey want judges who enforce the law and follow the law--not make the \nlaw.\n\n  They say she is out of the mainstream, but in 2002 on the California \nSupreme Court--surely everyone recognizes California is not a right-\nwing State. It is a State in which a higher percentage voted for John \nKerry. But in 2002, her colleagues on the California Supreme Court \nasked her to write the majority opinion for the court more times than \nany other justice on the court. Why would they do that if she is out of \nthe mainstream? Why would they have written letters on her behalf?\n  The way it works on the court, the justices meet and they discuss a \ncase, then the justices indicate how they are going to decide the case, \nwhat their decision is, a majority gets together, and someone is asked \nto write the opinion for the majority. The rest of the justices sign \nonto the majority opinion, if they agree to it. Sometimes they will \nfile a separate occurrence if they do not agree with everything in the \nopinion. In 2002, she was asked by her colleagues to write more \nmajority opinions than any other justice on the court. That speaks well \nfor the respect they have for her.\n  There has been much distortion of her record in an attempt to justify \nthese mud-slinging charges that have been made against her. Senator \nSchumer and others have cited the High-Voltage Wire Works case, saying \nshe dissented in this case. They claim that she dissented from it and \nthat shows her to be a radical judge, because it dealt with affirmative \naction and quotas and the California constitutional amendment that was \npassed by the people of California to eliminate quotas in California.\n  Let me state the truth: She did not dissent. She anchored and wrote \nand authored the unanimous decision of the California Supreme Court. \nThey asked her to write this affirmative action / California \nconstitutional amendment / Proposition 209 opinion. Her colleagues \nasked her to write it. She wrote it. They all joined in. It was a \nunanimous opinion. It was based on California Proposition 209 that \nsaid:\n\n       The State shall not discriminate against, or grant \n     preferential treatment to any individual or group on the \n     basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in \n     the operation of public employment, public education, or \n     public contracting.\n\n  The case involved the city of San Jose. They had a minority \ncontracting program that required minority contractors bidding on the \ncity projects to either utilize a specified percentage of minority and \nwomen contractors or document efforts to include women and \nsubcontractors in their bids.\n  Every judge who reviewed the case, including the trial judge, the \nintermediate appellate court judges where she previously sat, and the \nCalifornia Supreme Court Justices, agreed that the San Jose program \nconstituted ``preferential treatment'' within the meaning of \nProposition 209. They struck down the program.\n  And they suggest somehow she is against all affirmative action \nprograms in America and that she does not believe in those things. She \nhas explicitly stated otherwise. For example, in the High-Voltage Wire \nWorks opinion she explicitly stated this: ``equal protection does not \npreclude race-conscious\n\n[[Page S6122]]\n\nprograms.'' In other words, she is saying that there can be race-\nconscious programs in legislation under the equal protection clause, \nbut they cannot be too broadly used. It is a dangerous trend. You have \nto watch it and be careful. This is what the Supreme Court has said \nabout it. She also said there are many lawful ways for businesses to \nreach out to minorities and women. She favors that. That is mainstream \nlaw in America. I don't know what they are talking about when \nthey suggest her opinion, joined by all the justices of the California \nSupreme Court, was out of the mainstream. That is beyond the pale.\n\n  It is suggested she does not believe in stare decisis, the doctrine \nthat courts should tend to follow the previous opinions of courts. But \nall of us know, and I know Senator Schumer and anyone who believes in \ncivil liberties knows, a court opinion is not the same thing as the \nConstitution of the United States. Some prior court opinions have been \nrendered and made the law of the land which were not consistent with \nthe Constitution of the United States.\n  What about Plessy v. Ferguson? Justice Harlan dissented from that \nopinion, which said separate but equal was constitutional. Justice \nHarlan believed that separate but equal was unconstitutional. Were the \njudges who later reversed Plessy v. Ferguson activists? I don't think \nso. I think they were acting consistent with a clearer understanding of \nthe equal protection clause and the due process clause of the \nConstitution of the United States than the Court in Plessy. Why attack \nher on that basis? It is not legitimate.\n  The twelve judges on the California Third District Court of Appeals \nwrote on her behalf. They said:\n\n       Justice Brown has served California well. She has written \n     many important decisions establishing and reaffirming \n     important points of law. Her opinions reflect her belief in \n     the doctrine of stare decisis.\n\n  So the 12 judges who wrote on her behalf say she is a believer in \nstare decisis. Yet we have one or two Senators standing up and saying \nshe does not believe in that. Not so. In fact, she has a proven record \nof following and showing respect for precedent.\n  For example, in Kasler v. Lockyer, Justice Brown, in a California \nopinion, wrote the majority opinion for the court upholding an assault \nweapons ban. She followed a prior decision by the California Supreme \nCourt even though she believed that prior decision was wrongly decided \nand had dissented in it. But when it came back up, and the case had \nbeen decided, she deferred to the California Supreme Court's decision \neven though that wasn't her personal view. Doesn't that show she is \nproperly respectful of precedent?\n  Sometimes it is important that cases be challenged and judges \noverrule a prior decision. Sometimes, even if you think it is wrong, it \nis better to let it stand just to provide stability in the law. Judges \nhave to make that call frequently.\n  Senator Schumer says Justice Brown is an extremist and ``President \nClinton would never have nominated someone like this.'' But he has \nprobably forgotten Judge Paez, who was nominated to the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals by President Clinton. This is what a real activist is. \nThis speaks to what an activist judge is. This is what Judge Paez, who \nwe confirmed, says about his judicial philosophy: It includes ``an \nappreciation of the courts to act when they must, when the issue has \nbeen generated as a result of the failure of the political process to \nresolve a certain political question'' because in such instances, Judge \nPaez says, ``there's no choice but for the courts to resolve the \nquestion that perhaps ideally and preferably should be resolved through \nthe legislative process.''\n\n  I see the Presiding Officer, Senator Vitter, listened to that phrase. \nThat is what activism is. It is a belief that a judge can act even \nthough the legislature does not. It is a belief that if the legislature \ndoes not act, the judge has a right to act. That is a stated judicial \nphilosophy of activism. Janice Rogers Brown never said anything like \nthat, nothing close to that.\n  So I repeat again, this is a nominee with a sterling record. She has \nserved on the Third District Court of Appeals in California. She served \nin the attorney general's office of the State of California where she \nwrote appellate briefs to the appellate courts and argued cases \ninvolving criminal justice to defend convictions in the State. She now \nserves on the Supreme Court of California. She was reelected by an \noverwhelming vote, the highest vote of any judge on the ballot. We have \nreceived a letter on her behalf from all of the court of appeals \njustices who have served with her on the court of appeals, and four of \nthe six justices on the California Supreme Court, including the liberal \nicon, Justice Stanley Mosk.\n  I think this is a nominee who is worthy of confirmation. I am \ndisappointed and hurt by some of the mischaracterizations of her record \nand her philosophy. I believe if Senators review this nominee's record, \nthey will see she will make an outstanding justice. I am pleased she is \na native of my State, and I wish her every success.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for \nallowing me to go out of turn. I will be fairly short.\n  Mr. President, we have been debating the circuit court nominations of \nJustice Janice Rogers Brown and too many other nominees for way too \nlong. Justice Brown was first nominated to the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals in July of 2003.\n  Over the years, I have grown accustomed to the talking points of \nBrown's liberal opposition. I think I have them committed to memory \nnow. Some liberal elitists charge she is extreme. Some liberal elitists \ncharge she is out of the mainstream. Some liberal elitists charge she \nis a radical conservative.\n  This same broken record has been spun now for too many years, and \nwith too many nominees. Here is what is left out of this tired song and \ndance.\n  Justice Janice Rogers Brown is a proven jurist. Her credentials and \nher character are beyond reproach. She is a lifetime public servant \ncommitted to the extension of civil rights and equal justice under law, \nand there can be no doubt that these deep commitments grew in part out \nof a childhood that witnessed the true evil of Jim Crow segregation.\n  She came up the hard way. She served for 2 years as an associate \njustice on California's Third District Court of Appeals prior to being \nappointed to the California Supreme Court.\n  What has her record been there? To listen to the interest groups, you \nwould think she has led a one-woman crusade to destroy the civil rights \nof all Californians. Given Justice Brown's background, I have to say \nthis is an astonishing charge.\n\n  In order to once again dispel the false charge that Justice Janice \nRogers Brown is extreme, consider the following facts.\n  In 2002, Justice Brown's colleagues on the California Supreme Court \nturned to her more than any other justice to write the majority opinion \nfor the court. Is this out of the mainstream?\n  When Justice Brown was retained with 76 percent of the vote in her \nlast election, were the people of California installing a radical \nrevolutionary on the bench? Were there any mainstream Californians who \nvoted for her? That is a pretty impressive majority. After all, the \njunior Senator from California, who has spoken vociferously against \nJustice Brown, and many of the other of the President's circuit court \nnominees, one of Justice Brown's most vocal critics, once, I might say, \nwon reelection with only 53 percent of the vote.\n  Truth be told, there is nothing radical about Janice Rogers Brown. \nShe refuses to supplant her moral views for the law she is charged with \ninterpreting as a judge. Maybe the refusal to engage in activist \ndecisionmaking is radical at some predominantly liberal law schools, \nbut it is fully within the mainstream of American jurisprudence.\n  We have heard a lot about the background of Janice Rogers Brown in \nthis debate. I have been at the forefront of discussing her rise from \nthe Jim Crow South to her appointment as the first African-American \nwoman to serve on the California Supreme Court. We talk about her \nbackground because her story demonstrates that while America is not \nperfect, its commitment to the preservation and extension of civil \nrights is without parallel in the history of the world.\n\n[[Page S6123]]\n\n  Let me also add that no party has a monopoly on the promotion of \ndiversity. Yet, unfortunately, some of those who frequently speak about \nthe need for diversity on the bench have a rather limited definition of \ndiversity. As we saw with several other recent nominees, apparently \nsome believe only liberal minorities are sufficiently diverse for high \nFederal office, especially the Federal courts.\n  In the end, it is hard to avoid the conclusions of Justice Brown's \ncolleagues. I have here a letter written to me in my former capacity as \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee from a bipartisan group of Justice \nBrown's colleagues, including all of her former colleagues on the \nCalifornia Court of Appeals and Third Appellate District, as well as \nfour current members of the California Supreme Court.\n  Let me take a second or two and read you their assessment of Justice \nBrown.\n\n       Dear Mr. Chairman:\n       We are members of and present and former colleagues of \n     Justice Janice Rogers Brown on the California Supreme Court \n     and California Court of Appeals for the Third Appellate \n     District. Although we span the spectrum of ideologies, we \n     endorse her for appointment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for \n     the D.C. Circuit.\n       Much has been written about Justice Brown's humble \n     beginnings, and the story of her rise to the California \n     Supreme Court is truly compelling. But that alone would not \n     be enough to gain our endorsement for a seat on the federal \n     bench. We believe that Justice Brown is qualified because she \n     is a superb judge. We who have worked with her on a daily \n     basis know her to be extremely intelligent, keenly \n     analytical, and very hard working. We know that she is a \n     jurist who applies the law without favor, without bias, and \n     with an even hand. Because of these qualities, she has \n     quickly become one of the most prolific authors of majority \n     opinions on the California Supreme Court.\n       Although losing Justice Brown would remove an important \n     voice from the Supreme Court of California, she would be a \n     tremendous addition to the D.C. Circuit. Justice Brown would \n     bring to the court a rare blend of collegiality, modesty, and \n     intellectual stimulation. Her judicial opinions are \n     consistently thoughtful and eloquent. She interacts \n     collegially with her colleagues and maintains appropriate \n     judicial temperament in dealing with colleagues, court \n     personnel and counsel.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      McDonough Holland & Allen PC\n\n\n                                             Attorneys at Law,\n\n                                                 October 16, 2003.\n     Re Nomination of Justice Janice Rogers Brown to the U.S. \n         Court of Appeals for the D.C.

Let me put in the Record a couple comments by Ellis \nHorvitz and Regis Lane. Ellis Horvitz, a Democrat, one of the deans of \nthe Appellate Bar in California, has written in support of Justice \nBrown, noting:\n\n       In my opinion, Justice Brown possesses those qualities an \n     appellate justice should have. She is extremely intelligent, \n     very conscientious and hard working, refreshingly articulate, \n     and possessing great common sense and integrity. She is \n     courteous and gracious to the litigants and counsel who \n     appear before her.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                           Horvitz & Levy LLP,\n\n                                   Encino, CA, September 29, 2003.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary U.S. Senate, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Re Justice Janice Rodgers Brown nomination.\n\n       Dear Chairman Hatch: This letter is sent in support of \n     President Bush's nomination of Justice Janice Rodgers Brown \n     to the District of Columbia Court of Appeal.\n       Let me first introduce myself. I have been practicing law \n     in California for more than fifty years, almost all of that \n     time as a civil appellate specialist. Our firm of more than \n     thirty lawyers specializes in civil appeals. We appear \n     regularly in the California Court of Appeal and in the \n     California Supreme Court.\n       I have followed Justice Brown's career since she was \n     appointed to the California Supreme Court. Our firm has \n     appeared before her on many occasions. I have appeared before \n     her on several occasions. We have also studied her opinions, \n     majority, (concurring and dissenting), in many civil cases.\n       In my opinion, Justice Brown posses those qualities an \n     appellate justice should have. She is extremely intelligent, \n     very conscientious and hard working, refreshingly articulate, \n     and possessing great common sense and integrity. She is \n     courteous and gracious to the litigants and counsel who \n     appear before her.\n       I hope your Committee will approve her nomination \n     expeditiously. The President has made an excellent choice.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                 Ellis J. Horvitz.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Regis Lane, the executive director of Minorities in Law \nEnforcement, a coalition of minority law enforcement officers in \nCalifornia, wrote:\n\n       We recommend the confirmation of Justice Brown based on her \n     broad range of experience, personal integrity, good standing \n     in the community and dedication to public service. . . .\n       In many conversations with Justice Brown, I have discovered \n     that she is very passionate about the plight of racial \n     minorities in America, based on her upbringing in the South. \n     Justice Brown's views that all individuals who desire the \n     American dream, regardless of their race or creed, can and \n     should succeed in this country are consistent with MILE's \n     mission to ensure brighter futures for disadvantaged youth of \n     color.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Minorities In Law Enforcement,\n\n                                                   Sacramento, CA.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the Executive Board and \n     members of the Minorities In Law Enforcement organization \n     (MILE), we recommend that you confirm President George W. \n     Bush's nomination of California Supreme Court Associate \n     Justice Janice Rogers Brown to the United States Circuit \n     Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. MILE is a \n     coalition of ethnic minority law enforcement officers in \n     California dedicated to ensuring brighter futures for \n     disadvantaged youth and ensuring that no child is left \n     behind.\n\n[[Page S6124]]\n\n       We recommend the confirmation of Justice Brown based on her \n     broad range of experience, personal integrity, good standing \n     in the community and dedication to public service. Justice \n     Brown's powerful and exhilarating display of jurisprudence \n     exhibited in the written legal opinions she has issued as a \n     California Supreme Court justice, is respected by all, \n     regardless of race, political affiliation, or religious \n     background. Justice Brown is a fair and just person with \n     impeccable honesty, which is the standard by which justice is \n     carried out.\n       In many conversations with Justice Brown, I have discovered \n     that she is very passionate about the plight of racial \n     minorities in America, based on her upbringing in the south. \n     Justice Brown's views that all individuals who desire the \n     American dream, regardless of their race or creed, can and \n     should succeed in this country are consistent with MILE's \n     mission to ensure brighter futures for disadvantaged youth of \n     color.\n       It is with great honor and pleasure that MILE and our \n     members urge you to confirm President Bush's nomination of \n     California Supreme Court Associate Justice Janice Rogers \n     Brown to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the \n     District of Columbia.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n                                                       Regis Lane,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, she is not, as represented, a radical revolutionary \nbent on undoing the American dream. Who are you going to believe? I say \nyou should believe those who served with her on the bench in \nCalifornia, and that is over a period of years.\n  Because of the astonishing failure to give Justice Brown an up-or-\ndown vote, I have had ample time to review her record, and it is clear \nto me, without any doubt, that those who worked with her every day on \nthese courts have it right. She is a model jurist. You cannot have \nanybody who has been in court as long as she has that somebody cannot \npluck cases out of the air and distort them or find some fault with \nthem. I am sure I can find fault with some of her cases. But the point \nis, this is a woman who does what is right.\n  Justice Brown would be a welcome addition to the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals. I look forward to finally closing the debate on this \nnomination, bringing her nomination to a vote, and seeing her on the \nFederal bench.\n  Now, let me close by saying that voting for cloture is the right \nthing to do on the nomination of Justice Janice Rogers Brown and the \nrest of the President's judicial nominees. Allowing an up-or-down vote \non these nominees will return us to the Senate's 214-year tradition. So \nI ask my colleagues to vote yea on cloture, and hopefully we can have \nan up-or-down vote in a short time after that.\n  Mr. President, again, I thank my colleague and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand it, there is 7 minutes \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself all 7 minutes, and I ask \nif the Chair will be kind enough to let me know when there is 1 minute \nleft.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so notify.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think it is important for those \nwatching the debate to understand this decision is not a decision about \nthe life history of Janice Rogers Brown. What we are voting on in this \nparticular decision is, on the DC Circuit Court, whether the nominee is \ngoing to speak for the struggling middle class of Americans, whether \nthey are going to speak for minorities who have been trying to be a \npart of the American dream, whether they are going to speak for the \nrights and liberties of working families, particularly those who are \ncovered by the Occupational Safety and Health Act who work hard every \nday and have had their lives threatened with inadequate kinds of \nprotection, whether that voice is going to be standing up for children \nwhose lives are going to be affected by the Clean Air Act, or whether \nthey are going to stand up for the children whose lives will be \naffected by the Clean Water Act.\n  So many of the important decisions that we have addressed in the \nSenate over the last 30 years, in order to make this a fairer country, \na more just Nation, to advance the cause of economic progress and \nsocial justice, ultimately come to the DC Circuit. In many instances, \nthe DC Circuit is the final arbiter of these issues. That is why this \nis so important. Any judge is important, but I think, for most of us, \nwe raise the level when we consider who is going to serve on the \nSupreme Court, since that will be a defining aspect of the laws of this \ncountry, and a defining voice in terms of the rights and liberties of \nthis Nation as defined in the Constitution of the United States.\n  It seems to me it is fair enough to ask someone who wants a job on \nthe DC Circuit whether they have a core commitment to these fundamental \nacts of fairness and justice and basic liberty, and if there are \nindications during their service on the court that this jurist has \ndemonstrated a hostility toward these basic principles.\n  That is really the basic issue. I am going to have more time this \nafternoon to get into the particulars, but it is enormously important \nthat the American people understand that this is not just another \ncircuit court, as important as that is. This is the very specialized DC \nCircuit Court that has special responsibilities in interpreting the \nlaws, many cases of which never go to the Supreme Court, and, \ntherefore, we should take a careful view of this nominee. When we take \na careful view of the nominee, we find that this nominee fails the \nstandard by which we ought to judge advancement to the second most \nimportant and powerful court in the land, and that is the DC Circuit \nCourt.\n  That is true on the issue of civil rights. No one can seriously \ncontend that the overwhelming opposition to her nomination from the \nAfrican-American community is motivated by bias against Blacks. She is \nopposed by respected civil rights leaders, including Julian Bond, \nChairman of the NAACP; by Dorothy Height, President Emeritus of the \nNational Council of Negro Women, a leader in the battle for equality \nfor women and African Americans over her lifetime, an outstanding and \ndistinguished American who happens to be Black but has struggled to \nmake this a fairer and more just country--for Black women in \nparticular--for all Americans. She is universally admired and respected \nby Republicans and Democrats. She believes that we would make a major \nmistake by promoting this nominee to the DC circuit.\n  She is opposed by the Reverend Joseph Lowery, President Emeritus of \nthe Southern Christian Leadership Conference, who was there with Dr. \nMartin Luther King, Jr., during the most difficult and trying times in \nthe late 1950s and the early 1960s. I believe, unless I am wrong, he \nwas there at the time of Dr. King's death. He is one of the giants in \nawakening America to be America by knocking down walls of \ndiscrimination. Joseph Lowery believes we should not promote this \nindividual. He has been a leader in the civil rights movement and has \nworked tirelessly for many years to make civil rights a reality for all \nAmericans.\n  She is opposed by the Congressional Black Caucus, the Leadership \nConference on Civil Rights, and many others concerned with the rights \nof minorities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will have the opportunity to go into \nthe reasons these individuals and organizations take exception to this \nnominee. It isn't just those I have mentioned but other important \nleaders who have a keen awareness and understanding of the record and \nhistory of the decisions of this jurist. I do not believe she has \ndemonstrated the kind of core commitment to constitutional values which \nare so essential on such a major and important court. She fails that \ntest. She should not be promoted. There are other distinguished jurists \nacross the country of all different races, religions, and ethnic \nbackgrounds who have demonstrated a core commitment to these values \nover a long time and are in the mainstream of judicial thinking. We \nought to have such a nominee. This nominee does not meet that criteria \nand, therefore, should not be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the minority has expired. Who \nyields time?\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, it is often said that politicians are out \nof touch with the average citizen. In fact, media outlets have been \nreporting that\n\n[[Page S6125]]\n\nCongress's approval ratings are at record lows. I am not one to put \nmuch stock in one poll or another, but I do believe Americans are \nfrustrated with politics here in our Nation's Capital. Americans are \ndealing with record gas prices, yet Congress can't find the time to \ndebate and pass an energy bill that was proposed years ago. Americans \nsee weekly reports about scandals and backroom deals at the United \nNations, yet we can't find the time to vote yes or no on the \nPresident's nominee to the United Nations. And a strong majority of \nAmericans who just elected President Bush to a second term now cannot \nunderstand why his judicial nominees can't get a timely up-or-down \nvote.\n  A perfect example of the frustration the American people have with \nCongress can be found in the nomination of Justice Janice Rogers Brown. \nJustice Brown is the daughter of a sharecropper who grew up in rural \nAlabama and attended segregated schools. She went on to become the \nfirst African-American woman to serve on the California Supreme Court \nafter being overwhelmingly elected by more than three-quarters of \nCalifornia voters. Despite this extraordinary success story, Democrats \nhave used filibusters for more than a year and a half to deny Justice \nBrown a simple and fair vote.\n  I am pleased that a few of my colleagues on the other side choose to \nallow a vote on Justice Brown. Now I hope we can give her actual record \na fair assessment instead of relying on the heated rhetoric of the past \nyear and a half.\n  Justice Brown recently stated:\n\n       It may sound odd to describe a judge as both passionate and \n     restrained, but it is precisely this apparent paradox--\n     passionate devotion to the rule of law and humility in the \n     judicial role--that allows freedom to prevail in a democratic \n     Republic.\n\n  This paradox is a good description of our Nation's leading jurists, \nincluding, in my opinion, Justice Brown. I believe men and women of \nintellectual and judicial passion are necessary to the continued \nstrength of our legal system. Those jurists whose names still ring \nthrough history--Marshall, Holmes, Cardozo--suffered no shortage of \npassion. Yet, as Justice Brown reminds us, such passion would corrupt \nthe very system it sustains were it not tempered by restraint and \nhumility.\n  The tension between passion and restraint has been a feature of our \nlegal system since its beginning. In fact, it was enshrined in the \nConstitution itself. The Founders created the framework for a Federal \njudiciary that would be unaffected by the political storms raging at \nany given time. Thanks to their lifetime appointment, Federal jurists \nare free to interpret and apply the laws of this land without fear of \npolitical repercussions. At first glance, such an arrangement places a \ngreat deal of power in the hands of a select few who attain the Federal \nbench. The Founders, however, were mindful of such concerns. They \nplaced two popularly elected institutions at the gates of the Federal \nbench so that admission would be denied to those who would use their \njudicial power to override Congress's exclusive power to create the \nlaw. They invested the President with the power to nominate individuals \nworthy of the Federal bench. They endowed Congress's deliberative body, \nthis very Senate, with the responsibility to review the President's \nnominees and consent to the confirmation of only those with properly \nrestrained judicial passions.\n  When in the past a President has nominated an individual of unchecked \npassion, it has fallen to the Senate to deny his or her confirmation. \nThis is how our constitutional system has functioned for over 200 \nyears. Unfortunately, the nomination and appointment of Federal jurists \nhas recently become a game of political dodge ball, with Democrats \nthrowing heated rhetoric at nominees, hoping to take them out of the \ngame.\n  As the deliberation over judicial nominees has boiled over, the term \n``judicial activist'' has surfaced as the preferred slur used by \ncritics harboring political animosity toward a particular nominee, \nregardless of whether that nominee is objectively qualified for the \njob. In my mind, the term ``judicial activist'' signifies one who has \nor would use the bench as a platform for promoting their own agenda and \npersonal opinions. Such a person is in need of the restraint identified \nby Justice Brown and is, therefore, unsuited for the Federal bench. The \nnomination of a judicial activist is a nomination that deserves the \nopposition of every Member of this body, regardless of the political \nconnection between the nominee and any particular Member. According to \nthe Constitution, we as Senators stand here to guard the Federal bench \nfrom the confirmation of any judicial activist who would seek to \ninfringe upon our constitutional role.\n  I believe Justice Brown has proven she is not an activist judge. Her \ncritics have labeled her such simply because she has deeply held \npersonal beliefs that are not shared by many Democrats. This is \nprecisely the type of partisan game that is causing Americans to become \ndisinterested and disillusioned with politics in Washington. Americans \nfairly elected President Bush, and his nominations deserve a fair \ndebate and a fair vote.\n\n  People sitting at home watching the nomination process on TV see that \nit has gotten out of control. If we allow the President's judicial \nnominees to continue to be blocked and delayed because they have deeply \nheld beliefs, many good judges will be disqualified, and many more will \nrefuse to be considered. A person with strong beliefs and personal \nconvictions should not be barred from being a judge. In fact, I would \nrather have an honest liberal serve as a judge than one who has been \nneutered by fear of public opinion. We need judges who have \ndemonstrated integrity in how they live their lives as well as \nconsistency in how they interpret the law.\n  Justice Brown has demonstrated this kind of integrity. I believe she \nshould be confirmed immediately. Some Democrats may enjoy calling \nJustice Brown an activist for the media sound bite it creates, but \ncalling the Earth flat does not make it so. There is overwhelming \nevidence that during her time on the California Supreme Court, Justice \nBrown has exercised her judicial authority with restraint and humility. \nWhile she would likely describe herself as a person who believes in \nsmall government and limited regulations, she regularly votes against \nher personal beliefs when justice and legal precedent require her to do \nso.\n  For example, Justice Brown has voted consistently to uphold economic, \nenvironmental, consumer, and labor regulations. She joined in an \nopinion upholding the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of \n1986 and interpreted the act to allow the plaintiffs to proceed with \ntheir case. She upheld the right of a plaintiff to sue for exposure to \ntoxic chemicals using the Government's environmental regulations. She \njoined in an opinion validating State regulations regarding overtime \npay. She upheld California's very stringent standards for identifying \nand labeling milk and milk products, thereby ensuring that the \ngovernment has a role in protecting the safety of children.\n  It is fundamental to the judicial structure to have judges who \nrespect the Constitution and judicial precedent. Justice Brown believes \nthat the role of courts and the rule of law are deeply rooted in the \nConstitution.\n  In a recent column, law professor Jonathan Turley, a self-described \npro-choice social liberal, points out that ``Brown's legal opinions \nshow a willingness to vote against conservative views . . . when \njustice demands it.''\n  In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, 12 bipartisan judges \nwho served on the bench with Justice Brown said the following:\n\n       We who have worked with her on a daily basis know her to be \n     extremely intelligent, keenly analytical, and very hard \n     working. We know that she is a jurist who applies the law \n     without favor, without bias, and with an even hand. Because \n     of these qualities, she has quickly become one of the most \n     prolific authors of the majority opinions on the California \n     Supreme Court.\n\n  Arguments that Justice Brown is a judicial activist amount to nothing \nmore than empty rhetoric. She is a jurist of great intelligence and \nachievement, with views about interpreting the law that are sensible \nand reliable.\n  After many hours of debate, the main criticisms I have heard of \nJustice Brown have nothing to do with her judicial decisions but with \nher personal beliefs that have been expressed in speeches and comments \noutside the courtroom. This Senate should not confirm or reject judges \nbased on their personal beliefs. We should confirm\n\n[[Page S6126]]\n\nJustice Brown based on the fact that her judicial performance has been \ndocumented by colleagues and critics alike and because she understands \nthat her job is to interpret the law, not to invent the law.\n  Americans are tired and frustrated with Congress spending its time on \npartisan games. They want the Senate to give the President's judicial \nnominees a timely up-or-down vote.\n  Justice Brown's nomination has been pending for more than a year and \na half without any evidence that she lacks integrity, intellect, or \nexperience. There has been plenty of time for debate, and now it is \ntime to vote.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Janice Rogers \nBrown to the DC Appellate Court. I also rise today as a proud North \nCarolinian of those who served in this Chamber before me. In the heat \nof debate, Senator Schumer from New York suggested that Senator Helms, \nour former Member from North Carolina, was a racist; that, in fact, he \nobjected to the nomination of Roger Gregory to the appellate court, the \nFourth Circuit Court in Richmond, because he was a minority.\n  It is unfair to characterize that of Senator Helms. I am personally \noffended by the comments of Senator Schumer, and so are North \nCarolinians.\n  At the time of Roger Gregory's nomination to the Fourth Circuit Court \nin Richmond, the Fourth Circuit Court had the largest makeup of \nminorities of any appellate court in the country. The seat for which \nRoger Gregory was nominated was intended to be filled by a North \nCarolinian. There is only one problem--Roger Gregory was from Virginia, \nand he was so thought of that he was even introduced by Senator George \nAllen in his first speech on the Senate floor.\n  Roger Gregory was not from North Carolina, he was from Virginia. \nSenator Helms argued that North Carolina was underrepresented on the \nFourth Circuit Court and that if any nominee was necessary for the \nFourth Circuit Court, he or she should come from North Carolina. \nSenator Helms opposed Roger Gregory because Senator Helms had nominated \nTerrance Boyle, and that nomination had been blocked for several years \nat that time by Democrats. Terrance Boyle was originally nominated by \nGeorge H. W. Bush, 41, long before Roger Gregory was nominated.\n  I might add, Terrance Boyle still is a judicial nominee judge for the \nFourth Circuit Court. He has never made it through this process.\n  Former Judiciary Chairman Hatch, who spoke earlier, maintained at the \ntime that judicial nominees favored by each party should have to move \nforward together and that political games should not be played with \njudicial nominees. Senator Helms agreed there should be no movement on \nother judges until Judge Boyle received the attention of this body, the \nSenate.\n  How did it end up? President Clinton, bypassing Congress, made a \nrecess appointment of Roger Gregory, and it was seen as a swipe to \nSenator Helms.\n  I am not here today to suggest Roger Gregory was not a good pick. I \nam here to tell you we have an obligation on this floor to speak \nfactually. History does not prove that Senator Helms' objection was \nover anything other than to receive the attention of his nominee to the \nFourth Circuit Court, to allow North Carolina, which was \nunderrepresented, to be represented fully on the Fourth Circuit Court.\n  Today I am proud to suggest that we should all support Janice Rogers \nBrown. We should have her confirmed, not because she is minority, but \nbecause she is qualified, because she meets the threshold of what \nAmerica expects out of the judges who sit on the bench.\n  I am confident this body will do the right thing on cloture, and I am \nconfident she will serve on the DC Circuit Court.\n  I thank the President, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, recently 14 of our colleagues brought to us \na bipartisan plan to avoid what I thought was the majority leader's \nshortsighted bid for one-party rule. As part of the plan to avert the \nnuclear option, which would have changed more than 200 years of Senate \ntradition and precedent, rules protecting minority rights and checks \nand balances, those Senators have agreed to vote for cloture on this \ncontroversial and divisive renomination. I have no doubt they will \nfollow through on their commitment, but in all likelihood, it is going \nto result in the appointment for life of a judge for Court of Appeals \nfor the DC Circuit whose disturbing view of the Constitution would set \nback life for American workers and consumers more than 100 years and \nremove protections for people and their communities we now take for \ngranted. The preservation of our system of checks and balances in \nconnection with the appointment of lifetimers to the Federal judiciary \nrequires that all Senators, both Republicans and Democrats, take \nseriously the Senate's constitutionally mandated role as a partner in \nmaking these determinations.\n  So again I urge all Senators of both parties to take these matters \nseriously and vote their conscience. Senators need to evaluate with \nclear eyes the fitness of Justice Janice Rogers Brown for the lifetime \nappointment. My opposition to her, as it has always been, has been \nbased on her long and troubling record. I will be speaking about this \nmore in the future, but apparently she will be treated far more fairly \nthan President Clinton's nominees to the court.\n  The Senate has already considered one of the three controversial \nnominees mentioned in part IA of the Memorandum of Understanding our \ncolleagues brought us. We are now beginning consideration of the \nsecond, and I expect the third will follow shortly. What I do not \nexpect is any repeat by Democrats of the extraordinary obstruction by \nRepublicans of President Clinton's judicial nominees. For example, I do \nnot expect any of the tactics used by Republicans during the extensive \ndelay in Senate consideration of the Richard Paez nomination. Judge \nPaez waited more than 4 years before we were able to get a vote on his \nconfirmation, and even then Republicans mounted an extraordinary motion \nafter the filibuster of his nomination was broken to indefinitely \npostpone the vote--a last-ditch, unprecedented effort that was \nultimately unsuccessful.\n  More than 60 of President Clinton's moderate and qualified judicial \nnominations were subjected to a Republican pocket filibuster, including \nnominees to the DC Circuit. First we were told by the Republicans that \nwe do not need more judges added, but that changed dramatically once \nthey had a Republican President in power. But they also blocked by \ncommittee filibusters highly qualified people for that circuit. Allen \nSnyder, for example, who was nominated by President Clinton, was a \nformer clerk to Chief Justice Rehnquist--no wide-eyed liberal, he--and \nhe was a widely respected and highly regarded partner at the law firm \nof Hogan & Hartson. He was filibustered by pocket filibuster by the \nRepublicans and not allowed to come to a vote. Elena Kagan was pocket \nfilibustered by the Republicans, not allowed to have a vote for the DC \nCircuit. Her qualifications: She is now a dean of the most prestigious \nlaw school in this country, Harvard Law School. They were each \nnominated to vacancies on the DC Circuit. They were not allowed to have \neither a committee vote or Senate consideration.\n  The bipartisan coalition of Senators who joined together last month \nto avert an unnecessary showdown in the Senate over the White House-\ninspired effort to invoke the nuclear option was right to include in \nthe agreement the following provision:\n\n       We believe that under Article II, Section 2, of the United \n     States Constitution, the word\n\n[[Page S6127]]\n\n     ``Advice'' speaks to consultation between the Senate and the \n     President with regard to the use of the President's power to \n     make nominations. We encourage the Executive branch of \n     government to consult with members of the Senate, both \n     Democratic and Republican, prior to submitting a judicial \n     nomination to the Senate for consideration.\n       Such a return to the early practices of our government may \n     well serve to reduce the rancor that unfortunately \n     accompanies the advice and consent process in the Senate.\n       We firmly believe this agreement is consistent with the \n     traditions of the United States Senate that we as Senators \n     seek to uphold.\n\n  I agree with their fundamental point. I have served here with six \nPresidents. Five of them did consult on major judicial nominations. \nThey consulted with members of both parties. That included President \nFord, President Carter, President Reagan, former President Bush, and \nPresident Clinton. In this case, there was no meaningful consultation \nwith the nomination of Janice Rogers Brown. Maybe that is one reason \nneither of her home State Senators support her. In the past, \nRepublicans always said if home State Senators do not support a \nnominee, we cannot go forward. All of these rules changed with a \ndifferent President. There was no consultation with these Senators in \nthis case.\n\n  But I am hoping things may be better. I was pleased to see President \nBush respond to a question in a news conference last week. He has \nagreed to consult with the Senate about his nomination should a vacancy \narise in the Supreme Court. I see that as a positive development, and I \nam hoping that now that he has been reelected, he may take the \nopportunity to be a uniter and not a divider on these issues. Certainly \nI, as one on this side of the aisle, will be happy to work with him in \nthat regard. If he does, as the other five Presidents I have served \nwith have done, I believe it would be a good sign for the country but \nespecially for our Federal judiciary.\n  In advance of any vacancy on the Supreme Court, I would urge the \nPresident to follow through on his commitment to consult with the \nSenate. In the next few weeks, the U.S. Supreme Court will complete its \ncurrent term. Speculation will soon accelerate, again, about the \npotential for a Supreme Court vacancy this summer. In advance of any \nsuch vacancy, I urge the President to follow through on his commitment \nto consult with the Senate. As I said, previous Presidents of both \nparties have set constructive and successful examples by engaging in \nmeaningful consultation with the Senate, including both Republicans and \nDemocrats, no matter who was in the majority or the minority, before \ndeciding on nominees. It would be shortsighted to ignore such an \nestablished and successful precedent.\n  It would be wise for the President to follow the precedent set by \ndistinguished Presidents of both parties, and I stand ready to work \nwith him in that regard. I stand ready to work with the President to \nhelp select a nominee to the Supreme Court who can unite Americans. I \nknow that the Democratic leader is likewise ready to be helpful. After \nall, Senator Reid and I joined in an April 11 letter to the President \noffering our help in facilitating his identification, selection, and \nnomination of lower court judges to the 28 vacancies without a nominee \nthat then existed throughout the Federal judiciary. Regrettably, the \nPresident did not respond to our previous offer, and the vacancies \nwithout a nominee have since grown to 30.\n  Some Presidents, including most recently President Clinton, found \nconsultation with the Senate in advance of a nomination most beneficial \nin helping pave the way for a smooth and successful process. President \nReagan, on the other hand, disregarded the advice offered by Senate \nDemocratic leaders and chose a controversial, divisive nominee who was \nultimately rejected by the full Senate.\n  In his book ``Square Peg,'' Senator Hatch tells how, in 1993, as the \nranking minority member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he advised \nPresident Clinton about possible Supreme Court nominees. In his book, \nSenator Hatch recounts that he warned President Clinton away from a \nnominee whose confirmation he believed ``would not be easy.'' Senator \nHatch goes on to describe how he suggested the names of Stephen Breyer \nand Ruth Bader Ginsburg, both of whom were eventually nominated and \nconfirmed ``with relative ease.'' Indeed, 96 Senators voted in favor of \nJustice Ginsburg's confirmation, and only 3 Senators voted against; \nJustice Breyer received 87 affirmative votes, and only 9 Senators voted \nagainst.\n  In its report on the Supreme Court appointment process, the \nCongressional Research Service of the Library of Congress has long \nnoted:\n\n       It is common practice for Presidents, as a matter of \n     courtesy, to consult with Senate party leaders as well as \n     with members of the Senate Judiciary Committee before \n     choosing a nominee.\n\n  What I am suggesting has been standard and accepted practice. \nThorough bipartisan consultation would not only make the choice a \nbetter one, it would also reassure the Senate and the American people \nthat the process of selecting a Supreme Court Justice has not become \npoliticized. The Supreme Court often serves as a final arbiter and \nprotector of our individual rights and freedoms. Decisions regarding \nnominees are too important to all Americans to be unnecessarily \nembroiled in partisan politics.\n  Though the landscape ahead is sown with the potential for controversy \nand contention over vacancies that may arise on the Supreme Court, \nconfrontation is unnecessary and consensus should be our goal. I would \nhope that the President's objective will not be to send the Senate \nnominees so polarizing that their confirmations are eked out in narrow \nmargins. This would come at a steep and gratuitous price that the \nentire Nation would have to pay in needless division. It would serve \nthe country better to choose a qualified consensus candidate who can be \nbroadly supported by the public and by the Senate.\n  The process begins with the President. He is the only participant in \nthe process who can nominate candidates to fill Supreme Court \nvacancies. If there is a vacancy, the decisions made in the White House \nwill determine whether the nominee chosen will unite the Nation or will \ndivide the Nation. The power to avoid political warfare with regard to \nthe Supreme Court is in the hands of the President. No one in the \nSenate is spoiling for a fight. Only one person will decide whether \nthis will be a divisive or unifying process and nomination. If \nconsensus is a goal, bipartisan consultation will help achieve it. I \nbelieve that is what the American people want and what they deserve.\n  Over the last several years I have stressed the need for consultation \nand moderation as two guiding principles for selecting judicial \nnominees. I have been largely disappointed up to this point, but if \nthere is a vacancy on the Supreme Court of the United States, I hope \nthat the President will live up to his pledge to consult with Senators \nof both parties to identify consensus nominees who will unite us \ninstead of divide us. There is no need to pit Republicans against \nDemocrats or to divide the American people.\n  This is a difficult time for our country and we face many challenges. \nProviding adequate health care for all Americans, improving the \neconomic prospects of Americans, defending against threats, the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons, the continuing upheaval and American \nmilitary presence in Iraq, are all fundamental matters on which we need \nto improve. It is my hope that we can work together on many issues \nimportant to the American people, including our maintaining a fair and \nindependent judiciary. I am confident that a smooth nomination and \nconfirmation process can be developed on a bipartisan basis if we work \ntogether. The American people we represent and serve are entitled to no \nless.\n  The decisions of the Supreme Court have a lasting effect on the \nmeaning of the Constitution and statutes intended by Congress to \nprotect the rights of all Americans, such as the right to equal \nprotection of the laws and the right to privacy, as well as the best \nopportunity to have clean air and clean water ourselves and in future \ngenerations. This is the forum where Federal regulations protecting \nworkers' rights will be upheld or overturned, where reproductive rights \nwill be retained or lost and where intrusive Government action will be \nallowed or curtailed. This is the Court to which thousands of \nindividuals will appeal in matters affecting their health, their lives, \ntheir liberty, and their financial well-being.\n\n[[Page S6128]]\n\n  If the President chooses a Supreme Court nominee because of that \nnominee's ideology or record of activism in the hopes that he or she \nwill deliver predetermined political victories, the President will have \ndone so with full knowledge that he is starting a confirmation \nconfrontation. The Supreme Court should not be an arm of the Republican \nParty, nor should it be a wing of the Democratic Party. If the right-\nwing activists who were disappointed that the nuclear option was \naverted convince the President to choose a divisive nominee in order to \ntilt the ideological balance on the Supreme Court, they will not \nprevail without a difficult Senate battle. And if they do, what will \nthey have wrought? While they would celebrate the ideological takeover \nof the Supreme Court, the American people will be the losers: The \nlegitimacy of the judiciary will have suffered a damaging blow from \nwhich it may not soon recover. Such a contest would itself confirm that \nthe Supreme Court is just another setting for partisan contests and \npartisan outcomes. People will perceive the Federal courts as places in \nwhich ``the fix is in.''\n  Our Constitution establishes an independent Federal judiciary to be a \nbulwark of individual liberty against incursions or expansions of power \nby the political branches. The independence of our Federal courts has \nbeen called by Chief Justice Rehnquist the crown jewel of our justice \nsystem, but that independence is at grave risk when a President seeks \nto pack the courts with activists from either side of the political \nspectrum. One of the most serious mistakes a President can make is the \npartisan engineering to take over the Supreme Court. Even if \nsuccessful, such an effort would lead to decision-making based on \npolitics and forever diminish public confidence in our justice system.\n  I urge, respectfully but emphatically, that the President in advance \nof any nomination consult with Senators from both parties and seek \nconsensus. The American people will cheer if the President chooses \nsomeone who unifies the Nation. This is not the time and a vacancy on \nthis Supreme Court is not the setting in which to accentuate the \npolitical and ideological division within our country. In our \nlifetimes, there has never been a greater need for a unifying pick for \nthe Supreme Court. The independence of the Federal judiciary is \ncritical to our American concept of justice for all. We should expect \nand accept nothing less. We all want Justices who exhibit the kind of \nfidelity to the law that we all respect. We want them to have a strong \ncommitment to our shared constitutional values of individual liberties \nand equal protection. We expect them to have had a demonstrated record \nof commitment to equal rights. There are many conservatives who can \nmeet these critieria and who are not rigid ideologues.\n  Two years ago, I was invited to address the National Press Club on \nthis topic and noted that the Supreme Court confirmation process does \nnot have to be a political Armageddon. I continue to believe that and I \nurge the President to take the course that would better serve the \nAmerican people and the Supreme Court. I was encouraged by the \nPresident's recent statement indicating he will consult with leaders in \nthe Senate on both sides of the aisle in advance of a nomination. That \nshould allow him to bring forward a consensus nominee able to unite all \nAmericans and who could be confirmed by the Senate with 95 to 100 \nvotes. At a time when too many partisans seem fixated on devising \nstrategies to force the Senate to confirm the most extreme candidate \nwith the least number of votes possible, I have been urging cooperation \nand consultation to bring the country together. There is no more \nimportant opportunity than this to lead the Nation in a direction of \ncooperation and unity. I hope this President heeds the lesson of \nhistory set by his predecessors who chose the good of the country over \nthe good of a political party.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in a few moments, we will vote to conclude \ndebate on the nomination of Janice Rogers Brown to serve on the Court \nof Appeals for the DC Circuit. I do want to thank the chairman and \nranking member for getting us to this point. It has taken awhile for us \nto reach this point, and I am pleased that in an orderly process and \nregular order, we are on the way to getting an up-or-down vote for \nJanice Rogers Brown.\n  It has been nearly 2 years since President Bush first nominated \nJustice Brown as a Federal judge. During those 2 years, she has been \nthoroughly debated, exhaustively investigated in committee and on the \nSenate floor. She has endured more than 5 hours of committee hearings, \nanswered more than 180 questions, submitted 33 pages of responses to an \nadditional 120 written questions, has set aside weeks at a time to \npersonally meet with individual Senators, has waited patiently while \nthe Judiciary Committee debated and voted on her nomination. On the \nSenate floor, we have debated her nomination for over 50 hours. That is \nmore time than the Senate debated any one of the current Supreme Court \nJustices, but still as of yet she has not received an up-or-down vote \non her nomination on the floor, not one. Why? Because of an \norchestrated campaign of obstruction that has denied her that up-or-\ndown vote until now. So she has been waiting for far too long for a \nsimple up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. As a matter of principle, \nas a matter of fairness, as a matter of our constitutional duties as \nSenators to give up-or-down votes, it is time to bring the debate to a \nclose and to vote.\n  Fairness is not just about the process of a vote. It is about \ntreating a good, decent, hard-working American with the respect and the \ndignity she deserves.\n  Justice Brown is an inspiration. All of us have heard her story, how \nshe was born the daughter of an Alabama sharecropper and educated in \nsegregated schools; how she worked her way through college and law \nschool; how she has dedicated her life to public service and to others, \nhaving spent all but 2 years of her 26-year legal career as a public \nservant; how she is the first African-American woman to serve as an \nassociate justice on the California Supreme Court, the State's highest \ncourt. We have heard about her exemplary qualifications and \ncredentials, including her 8 years of experience on the California \nappellate bench. We have heard about her impressive record and her \ncommitment to judicial restraint and the rule of law. We have heard the \nbipartisan praises of Justice Brown from those who know her best: her \ncurrent and former colleagues on the California Supreme Court and \nCalifornia Court of Appeals. They agree that Janice Rogers Brown is a \nsuperb judge and have said she is a jurist who applies the law without \nfavor, without bias, and with an even hand.\n  We have heard the people of California speaking with their votes. As \na justice on the California Supreme Court, she was retained by 76 \npercent of the electorate, the highest vote percentage of all justices \non the ballot. If 76 percent of the people of California voted for \nJanice Rogers Brown, how can she be considered out of the mainstream, \nas some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \nsuggested? Are 76 percent of the California voters out of the \nmainstream? Janice Rogers Brown is in the mainstream.\n  The overwhelming support of the people of California and the support \nof her colleagues proves her nomination transcends partisan labels and \nideology. Janice Rogers Brown is a distinguished mainstream jurist. She \ndeserves to be treated fairly. She has been investigated and debated \nthoroughly. Now she deserves the courtesy of a vote. Vote yes or no. \nVote to confirm or reject, but let us vote.\n  I remain optimistic the Senate is moving in a new direction on \njudicial nominees, rejecting the partisan obstructionism of the past \nand embracing the principle that all judicial nominees deserve a fair \nup-or-down vote. I urge my colleagues to join me in bringing debate on \nthis nomination to a close and ensuring that Judge Brown will get an \nup-or-down vote.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. Under the previous \norder, the hour of 12 noon having arrived, pursuant to rule XXII, the \nChair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of Senate, do \n     hereby move to\n\n[[Page S6129]]\n\n     bring to a close debate on Executive Calendar No. 72, the \n     nomination of Janice R.

The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n\n                     National Hunger Awareness Day\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, for the past two years I have come to the \nSenate floor on National Hunger Awareness Day to talk about the battle \nagainst hunger, both here in America and around the world. In fact, I \nreserved my maiden speech for this topic--one of my top priorities as a \nU.S. Senator. I have stated over and over again that the battle against \nhunger is one that can't be won in a matter of months or even a few \nyears but it is a victory that we can claim if we continue to make the \nissue a priority.\n  As Washington Post columnist David Broder said about hunger, \n``America has some problems that seem to defy solution. This one does \nnot. It just needs caring people and a caring government, working \ntogether.'' I could not agree more.\n  Last year on Hunger Awareness Day, Senators Smith, Durbin, Lincoln, \nand I launched the Senate Hunger Caucus, with the express purpose of \nproviding a bi-partisan forum for Senators and staff to engage each \nother on national and international hunger and food insecurity issues. \nBy hosting briefings and disseminating information, the caucus has been \nstriving to bring awareness to these issues, while at the same time \nfinding ways to collaborate on legislation. I want to thank 34 of my \ncolleagues for joining the Senate Hunger Caucus and their staffs for \ntheir diligent work. In addition, I am excited to see our friends in \nthe House of Representatives start their own Hunger Caucus and I look \nforward to working with them as both houses of Congress continue to \nfind solutions to eliminating hunger.\n  It is truly astounding how so many of our fellow citizens go hungry \nor are living on the edge of hunger each and every day. Thirteen \nmillion of these hungry Americans are deemed to be children.\n  As we know, when children are hungry they do not learn. This is a \ntravesty that can and should be prevented. Currently over 90,000 \nschools and 28 million children participate each school day in the \nSchool Lunch Program. The children of families whose income levels are \nbelow 130 percent of poverty are eligible for free school meals and \nthose families whose income levels are between 130 percent of poverty \nand 185 percent of poverty are eligible for reduced price meals.\n  Unfortunately, many State and local school boards have informed me \nthat parents are finding it difficult to pay the reduced fee, and for \nsome families the fee is an insurmountable barrier to participation. \nThat is why I am a strong supporter of legislation to eliminate the \nreduced price fee and harmonize the free income guideline with the WIC \nincome guideline. I am proud to say that a pilot program to eliminate \nthe reduced price fee in up to five states was included in last year's \nreauthorization of Child Nutrition and WIC. I have encouraged the \nAppropriations Committee to include funding for this pilot program, and \nI look forward to working with them on this very important issue which \ntouches so many families going through difficult times.\n\n  In my home State of North Carolina, more than 900,000 of our 8.2 \nmillion residents are dealing with hunger, according to the most recent \nnumbers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Our State has faced \nsignificant economic hardship over the last few years as once thriving \ntowns have been hit hard by the closing of textile mills and furniture \nfactories. And this story is not unlike so many others across the \ncountry.\n  Many Americans who have lost their manufacturing jobs have been \nfortunate enough to find new employment in the changing climate of \ntoday's workforce. Simply being able to hold down job doesn't \nnecessarily guarantee your family three square meals a day. But there \nare organizations who are addressing this need as a mission field.\n  Groups like the Society of St. Andrew, the only comprehensive program \nin North Carolina that gleans available produce from farms, and then \nsorts, packages, processes, transports and delivers excess food to feed \nthe hungry. In 2004, the Society gleaned more than 4.2 million pounds \nof food--or 12.8 million servings. Incredibly--it only costs one penny \na serving to glean and deliver this food to those in need. And all of \nthis work is done by the hands of the 9,200 volunteers and a tiny \nstaff.\n  Gleaning is a practice we should utilize much more extensively today. \nIt's astounding that the most recent figures available indicate that \napproximately 96 billion pounds of good, nutritious food--including \nthat at the farm and retail level--is left over or thrown\n\n[[Page S6130]]\n\naway. A tomato farmer in western North Carolina sends 20,000 pounds of \ntomatoes to landfills each day during harvest season.\n  This can't be good for the environment. In fact, food is the single \nlargest component of our solid waste stream--more than yard trimmings \nor even newspaper. Some of it does decompose, but it often takes \nseveral years. Other food just sits in landfills, literally mummified. \nPutting this food to good use through gleaning will reduce the amount \nof waste going to our already overburdened landfills. And I am so \nappreciative of my friends at Environmental Defense for working closely \nwith us on this issue.\n  Like any humanitarian endeavor, the gleaning system works because of \ncooperative efforts. Clearly private organizations and individuals are \ndoing a great job, but they are doing so with limited resources. It is \nup to us to make some changes on the public side and help leverage \nscarce dollars to feed the hungry.\n  I continue to hear that transportation is the single biggest concern \nfor gleaners. I am proud to say that with the help of organizations \nsuch as the American Trucking Association, the Society of Saint Andrew \nand America's Second Harvest, we are taking steps to ease that \ntransportation concern. In February of this year, I reintroduced a bill \nthat will change the tax code to give transportation companies tax \nincentives for volunteering trucks to transfer gleaned food. I am proud \nto have the support of my colleagues, Senators Dodd, Burr, Lugar, \nAlexander, Santorum, Durbin, Lautenberg, and Lincoln, original \ncosponsors, and I look forward to working with them on passage of this \nimportant bill.\n\n  I am also privileged to work with Senators Lincoln and Lautenberg on \na soon-to-be-introduced bill to provide up to $200,000 per fiscal year \nto eligible entities willing to carry out food rescue and job training. \nEntities like the Community Culinary School of Charlotte, a private, \nnon-profit organization in my home State that provides training and job \nplacement in the food service industry for people who are employed or \nunderemployed.\n  Here is how it works. The Community Culinary School recruits students \nfrom social service agencies, homeless shelters, halfway houses and \nwork release programs. They then work in collaboration with food rescue \nagencies in the area to provide meals to homebound individuals and to \nlocal homeless shelters. The food they rescue is donated and picked up \nfrom restaurants, grocers and wholesalers. The students then prepare \nnutritious meals using the donated food while at the same time \ndeveloping both culinary and life skills.\n  Take a young lady from this program named Sibyl. After years of \ndrugs, prisons and unplanned pregnancies, Sibyl entered the Community \nCulinary School of Charlotte. Her willingness and determination made \nher the top student of her class and she is today working full time as \na chef.\n  Or take Bobby, who also graduated from the program. Bobby went from \nunemployment and homelessness to becoming a top graduate, now working \ntwo jobs and living independently. Our bill is intended to complement \nthese kinds of private efforts that support food rescue and job skills \nthat can make the greatest impact on individual lives.\n  In Deuteronomy 15:7, the Bible tells us, ``If there is among you a \npoor man, one of your brethren, in any of your towns within your land \nwhich the Lord your God gives you, you shall not harden your heart or \nshut your hand against your poor brother.'' So, as our fellow citizens \nin the private sector continue to be a giving people, let us find ways \nas public servants to once again harness the great public-private \neffort, and fight as one to end hunger in America. I again thank my \ncolleagues who have worked so hard to build these partnerships. And I \nimplore our friends on both sides of the aisle--as well as the good \npeople throughout this great country--to join in this heartfelt \nmission--this grassroots network of compassion that transcends \npolitical ideology and will provide hope and security not only for \nthose in need today--but for future generations as well. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, due to his graciousness, I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Kennedy be allowed to speak directly after I \ncomplete my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I want to pay a tremendous compliment \nwith a huge sense of gratitude to my colleague from North Carolina for \nher tirelessness with regard to this issue. She has been such an \nincredible fighter against the issue of hunger among Americans and \nreally among her fellow man globally. I compliment her and thank her so \nmuch for the opportunity to work with her on something in which she has \nbeen a true leader. I am looking forward to many more things that we \ncan do together, but she has made a huge effort in eliminating hunger.\n  We are here today to refocus ourselves and rededicate ourselves to \nbringing about a tremendous awareness to hunger as it exists in our \nNation and certainly as it exists among our fellow man across the \nglobe. I thank the Senator from North Carolina for all of her hard \nwork.\n  I do come to the floor to join my colleague from North Carolina on an \nissue that I take very seriously. Thirty-six million Americans, \nincluding 13 million children, live on the verge of hunger. It is \nabsolutely phenomenal to me, growing up as a farmer's daughter in the \nMississippi Delta where there was such plenty in the fields, as I drive \npast them, to think that there are Americans, particularly American \nchildren, who go hungry every day not because we don't have the means \nbut because we don't organize ourselves and set the priority of making \nsure these future generations, the future leaders of this great Nation, \ncan at least have their tummies full enough that they can pay attention \nin school, grow healthy to become the kind of leaders that we want and \nneed for our great Nation.\n  Today is National Hunger Awareness Day. It is a time when Americans \nare called to remember the hungry children and adults living across our \nNation. We have all just come from our weekly caucus lunches. We have \nhad plenty at this time. We are thinking about the opportunities that \nlie ahead of us, particularly the fun things that children do in the \nsummertime. Yet we forget that there are many who have not had a good \nlunch today, or perhaps we forget that as school is letting out, those \nchildren who normally get a nutritious meal at school will not be \ngetting those nutritious meals during the summertime while school is \nout.\n  Most importantly, it is a day when we are called to put our words \ninto action, to help end hunger in our communities and across this \ngreat land.\n  At this time last year, Senators Smith, Durbin, Dole, and myself \nformed the Senate Hunger Caucus to forge a bipartisan effort to end \nhunger in our Nation and around the world. I am so proud to be working \nwith these three other Senators in moving this caucus forward. Our \nstaffs have worked tirelessly in bringing us together, along with the \nother Members of the Senate, in order to make a difference. We are \nworking with local, State, and national antihunger organizations to \nraise awareness about hunger, build partnerships, and build solutions \nto end hunger.\n\n  We have many challenges that face our Nation, and so many challenges \nthat face this body itself. Yet this is one problem we know has an \nanswer. And we know how to end hunger.\n  Recently I introduced, with Senators Durbin, Smith, and Lugar, the \nHunger-Free Communities Act of 2005. This bill calls for a renewed \nnational commitment to ending hunger in the United States by 2015, \nreaffirms our congressional commitment to protecting the funding and \nintegrity of Federal food and nutrition programs, and it creates a \nnational grant program to support community-based antihunger efforts. I \nurge all of our colleagues to support this worthy and commonsense \nlegislation. It sets a goal for a monumental concern and problem that \nwe have in this Nation. It presents the answer, and it sets the time in \nwhich we want to reach that goal.\n  Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to talk about the 36 \nmillion Americans, including 13 million children, who live on the verge \nof hunger.\n\n[[Page S6131]]\n\n  Some people may ask--what can I do to help end hunger in America? I \nwant to talk about some of the ways Americans can help join the hunger-\nrelief effort. Acting on this call to feed the hungry requires the \neffort of every American and every sector of the economy.\n  The backbone of this effort is the willingness of Congress and the \nAmerican people to support the Federal food and nutrition programs. \nThese programs provide an essential safety net to working Americans, \npreventing the most vulnerable among us from suffering, and even dying, \nfrom malnutrition. Our continued investment in these programs is vital \nto the health of this nation.\n  The most significant of these programs, the Food Stamp Program, \nprovides nutritious food to over 23 million Americans a year. More \nAmericans find themselves in need of this program every year. Despite \nthis growing need, the Administration proposes to cut the Food Stamp \nProgram by $500 million over the next 5 years by cutting more than \n300,000 low-income people off the program in an average month.\n  I understand our current budget constraints. However, even in these \ntight fiscal times, I believe that we must maintain our commitment to \nfeed the hungry.\n  Therefore, we must first protect programs like the Food Stamp \nProgram, the National School Breakfast and Lunch Program, Summer \nFeeding Program, WIC, and the Child and Adult Care Food Program. I urge \nAmericans to contact their congressional representatives to voice their \nsupport for these programs. I urge my colleagues to support these \nprograms and protect them from cuts and structural changes that will \nundermine their ability to serve our Nation's most vulnerable citizens.\n  In addition to the Federal food programs, eliminating hunger in \nAmerica requires the help of community organizations. Government \nprograms provide a basis of support, but they cannot do the work alone. \nCommunity and faith-based organizations are essential to locating and \nrooting out hunger wherever it persists. We rely on the work of local \nfood banks, food pantries, soup kitchens, and community action centers \nacross America to go where government cannot. I will do all I can to \nprovide the resources these community organizations need to continue \nwith the difficult but necessary work they perform.\n  Private corporations and small businesses also have a role to play in \neliminating hunger in America. Our corporations and small businesses \ngenerate most of our Nation's wealth and have throughout history \nsupported many of our greatest endeavors. Many corporations and \nbusinesses already contribute to efforts to eliminate hunger, and I \nhope others will begin to participate as opportunities to do so present \nthemselves in the future.\n  A great example of how businesses and non-profits can partner to feed \nhungry people occurred this past Friday in Little Rock. Arkansas-based \nTyson Foods and Riceland Foods, along with Jonesboro's Kraft Foods Post \nDivision and Nestle's Prepared Foods Facility, donated truck loads of \nfood as a special donation in honor of National Hunger Awareness Day. \nThis food will go to the Arkansas Rice Depot, Potluck, Inc. and the \nArkansas Hunger Relief Alliance, which represents six food banks \nlocated across Arkansas. These organizations will in turn use the food \nto help feed hungry Arkansans. I am grateful to these companies and \nnon-profit organizations for their leadership in this effort to feed \nthe over 450,000 Arkansans who have limited access to food.\n  Ending hunger in America requires the commitment of individual \nAmericans. Our greatest national strength is the power that comes from \nindividual initiatives and the collective will of the American people. \nI believe we are called by a higher power to care for our fellow men \nand women, and as a part of my Christian faith I know we are called to \nserve the poor and the hungry. I know it is a common denominator among \nalmost all of our faiths that it is those, the poor and the hungry, the \norphaned and the widowed, whom we are here, as our fellow man, to take \ncare of, to help to lift them up.\n  If we believe in this call, we must live it every day--in our schools \nand in our homes, in our workplaces, our places of worship, in our \nvolunteering, and, yes, in our prayers. This personal responsibility is \na great one, but it holds tremendous power. It is a common denominator \nthat can bring us together, the one problem that we all agree on and to \nwhich we know there is a solution. For as we have seen throughout \nAmerican history, when individuals in this Nation bind together to \nserve a common cause, they can achieve the greatest of accomplishments. \nBy sharing the many blessings and resources our Nation provides, I am \nconfident that we can alleviate hunger at home and abroad.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today is National Hunger Awareness Day, \nand it is an opportunity for all of us in Congress to pledge a greater \neffort to deal effectively with this festering problem that shames our \nNation and has grown even more serious in recent years. It is a chance \nto live out our moral commitment to care for our neighbors and fellow \ncitizens who have fallen on hard times.\n  The number of Americans living in hunger, or on the brink of hunger, \nnow totals 36 million, 3 million more since President Bush took office. \nThat total includes 13 million children, 400,000 more since 2001.\n  Day in and day out, the needs of millions of Americans living in \nhunger are widely ignored, and too often their voices have been \nsilenced. Their battle is a constant ongoing struggle. It undermines \ntheir productivity, their earning power, and their health. It keeps \ntheir children from concentrating and learning in school. We all need \nto do more to combat it--government, corporations, communities, and \ncitizens must work together to develop better policies and faster \nresponses.\n  In Massachusetts, organizations such as the Greater Boston Food Bank, \nProject Bread, the Worcester County Food Bank, and many others serve on \nthe frontlines every day, and they deserve our full support, but they \nshould not have to wage the battle alone.\n  In 1996, the Clinton administration pledged to begin an effort to cut \nhunger in half in the United States by 2010, and the strong economy \nenabled us to make significant progress toward that goal. Hunger \ndecreased steadily through 2000. We now have 5 years left to fulfill \nthat commitment.\n  The fastest, most direct way to reduce hunger in the Nation is to \nimprove and expand current Federal nutrition programs. Sadly, the \ncurrent Administration and the Republican Congress propose to reduce, \nnot increase, funds for important programs such as Food Stamps, and the \nCommunity Nutrition Program.\n  The Food Stamp Program is designed to be available to all eligible \nindividuals and households in the United States. It provides a basic \nand essential safety net to millions of people. In 2003, on average, \nover 21 million Americans received food stamp benefits. Over half of \nall food stamp recipients are children.\n  Now, the administration plans to reduce, or even cut off, food stamps \nfor recipients who rely on Medicare to afford the prescription drugs \nthey need.\n  That is why I have introduced legislation to ensure that individuals \nwho receive Medicare prescription drug benefits do not lose their food \nstamps. This legislation ensures that seniors do not have to choose \nbetween food and medicine. I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation.\n  It is time to do more for the most vulnerable in our society. \nNational Hunger Awareness Day is our chance to pledge to eradicate \nhunger in America and to mean it when we say it.\n  Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Senator Dole and Senator \nLincoln for giving focus and attention to National Hunger Awareness Day \nand for all they do on this particular issue. I had the opportunity \nyesterday to visit The Greater Boston Food Bank in Massachusetts--a \nsuccessful food bank. We have 517,000 people who are hungry in eastern \nMassachusetts alone, over 173,000 of those individuals are children, \nand over 50,000 are elderly.\n  One thing we know how to do in this country is grow food. We can do \nthat better than any other place in the world. Secondly, we know how to \ndeliver packages of food with Federal Express, other kinds of delivery \nservices, virtually overnight. The fact that we\n\n[[Page S6132]]\n\nhave hunger in this Nation, we have children who are hungry, frail \nelderly who are hungry, working families who are hungry, or other \nhomeless people who are hungry, we as a nation are failing our \nhumanity. We know what can be done. It needs the combination of a \ngovernmental framework, private framework, and a very important \ninvolvement from the nonprofit framework and other groups at the local \nlevel, religious groups that have done such important work.\n  So I commend my friends and colleagues for bringing focus and \nattention to this issue. It has enormous implications. We find out in \nterms of education provided to the children, the needy children at \nbreakfast for them early in the morning, the results in terms of their \nwillingness, ability, and interest in cooperating with their teacher \nand learning go up immensely. We have information that documents all of \nthat. Try to teach a hungry child to learn, and any teacher will tell \nyou the complexities and difficulties and the frustrations in doing \nthat.\n  I thank my two friends and others who are part of this movement. I \nlook forward to working with them on a matter of enormous importance \nand consequence.\n  Mr DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to note National Hunger \nAwareness Day.\n  I am meeting today with 35 people here from Illinois who came to \nWashington to remind us that hunger is not a Democratic or Republican \nissue.\n  Basic sustenance ought to be a guarantee in a civilized society, not \na gamble.\n  If children--or adults--are hungry in America, that's a problem for \nall of us. And it is a problem we can do something about.\n  For instance, we know that Federal nutrition programs work. WIC, food \nstamps, school lnch and breakfast programs, and other Federal nutrition \nprograms are reaching record numbers of Americans today, and making \nlives better.\n  The problem is we are not reaching enough people. There are still too \nmany parents in this country who skip meals because there is not enough \nmoney in the family food budget for them and their children to eat \nevery night.\n  There are still too many babies and toddlers in America who are not \ngetting the nutrition their minds and bodies need to develop to their \nfullest potential. There are still too many seniors and children who go \nto bed hungry.\n  There are 36 million Americans who are hungry or at risk of hunger. \nIn the richest Nation in the history of the world, that is \nunacceptable.\n  Last week, I joined with several of my Senate colleagues to introduce \nthe Hunger-Free Communities Act.\n  The bill is designed to promote local collaboration in the fight \nagainst hunger. But it also reminds us that we as a country are \ncommitted to ending hunger. We know how. We need to muster the \npolitical will.\n  We started this week by challenging our own offices to participate in \na Senate food drive. I commend Senators Lincoln, Smith, and Dole for \ntheir help in collecting food that will be donated to the Capitol Area \nCommunity Food Bank.\n  I look forward to working with people in the anti-hunger community \nand with my colleagues to eliminate domestic hunger in our lifetime.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise to commend the efforts of our \nNation's civic, business and faith leaders to call attention to the \nincreasing number of Americans who are unable to put food on their \ntables. Today, on National Hunger Awareness Day, I am proud to join \nwith communities in every region of my State that are taking on the \ncharge to end hunger in the United States.\n  Growing up in Colorado's San Luis Valley, one of the poorest regions \nin the country, my family did not have electricity or running water in \nour home. But our family farm ensured that my brothers and sisters and \nI never went to bed hungry or arrived at school on an empty stomach. My \nclassmates were not always as fortunate. Sadly, not much has changed \nsince my youth.\n  Currently, in Conejos County, where my family's farm is located, one \nin four residents are living in poverty. That is twice the national \naverage, and three times our State poverty rate. And increasingly, the \nstories behind these numbers are of working poor households who \nstruggle to pay their mortgages, escalating electricity bills and fuel \ncosts. In Colorado Springs, the Care and Share Food Bank estimated that \nclose to 50 percent of the households receiving their emergency food \nassistance last year had at least one working parent. More and more, \nthese families need to turn to their local food bank or church pantry \nin the very same communities where food is harvested; serving as a sad \nreminder that there is much more work to be done.\n  When speaking with hunger relief organizations throughout Colorado, \nthey express concern when forced to turn families away, and the number \nof people they cannot help continues to grow. For example, the Marian \nHouse, which is operated by Catholic Charities of Colorado Springs, \nserves approximately 600 meals. Over the past several years, they have \nseen the daily number of people coming into food banks nearly double.\n  Unfortunately, their stories of growing demands reflect the problems \nfacing much of the rural West. In fact, according to the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, 16 percent of households in this region did \nnot know where their next meal would come from--that is the highest \nrate of so-called ``food insecurity'' in any region of the country.\n  In the face of these staggering statistics, Coloradans are doing \ntheir part to eliminate hunger. Whether it is organizing a food drive \nin their school or office, volunteering at a soup kitchen, or donating \nto their local food bank, they are answering the call to reduce the \nnumber of hungry Americans. In Denver, where poverty is also on the \nrise, groups like the Food Bank of the Rockies have stepped up their \nfood distribution. In 2004, hard-working, committed workers and \nvolunteers distributed over 16 million pounds of food and essential \nhousehold items, more than ever before.\n  However, today is a special day, where national, regional and local \norganizations collectively are raising awareness of hunger in America. \nI am particularly proud that National Hunger Awareness Day events have \nbeen organized in communities throughout Colorado, including Colorado \nSprings, Denver, Fort Collins, Grand Junction, Greeley, and Hot Sulphur \nSprings. I applaud Coloradans involved in these activities, and all \nthose participating in the day's related events. I look forward to \nworking with the Senate Hunger Caucus and the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee in the movement to end hunger.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a problem \nimpacting communities across the United States and throughout the \nworld. As many of my colleagues know, today is National Hunger \nAwareness Day. It is a day meant to focus our attention on those for \nwhom putting food on the table continues to be a daily struggle.\n  For the last several years, my home State of Oregon has been at or \nnear the top of repeated nationwide studies of hunger and food \ninsecurity in the United States. While we have made some progress in \nfighting hunger in Oregon, there is still a long way to go to ensuring \nthat children and families in my State and around the country do not go \nto bed hungry. According the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic \nResearch Service, in 2003, approximately 36.3 million Americans lived \nin households that at some point during the year did not have access to \nenough food to meet their basic needs. Of those 36.3 million, 3.9 \nmillion were considered hungry.\n  In 2003, Oregon State University published a study on food insecurity \nand hunger in Oregon. The study found that pressures related to the \nhigh-cost of housing, health care, and the high-level of unemployment \nall contribute to food insecurity and hunger in our State. One of the \nmore striking findings in the report is that underemployment is also a \nmajor factor leading to hunger and food insecurity; working families \nthroughout Oregon are having a difficult time accessing food.\n  On the horizon, Oregon's economy appears to be brightening. While \nthere are no quick fixes, I believe that solving hunger is within our \ngrasp. Federal nutrition programs certainly serve an important safety \nnet role in combating hunger; however, they are only one\n\n[[Page S6133]]\n\npiece of the puzzle. Community organizations, churches, business \ngroups, and private citizens all have a part to play. Ultimately, \nwinning the fight against hunger in Oregon and around the country \nrequires that families are able to provide for themselves--that means \nhaving access to living wage jobs.\n  Many of my colleagues will remember that last year I asked them to \njoin me in forming a Senate caucus devoted to raising awareness of the \nroot causes of hunger and food insecurity. I appreciate very much the \nwork of my Senate Hunger Caucus cochairs Senator Lincoln, Senator Dole, \nand Senator Durbin--in helping to get the caucus off the ground. I am \nproud to say that today, the Senate Hunger Caucus counts 34 members, \nwith both Republicans and Democrats.\n  This is clearly not a battle that will be won overnight, but it is \nsomething about which our conscience calls us to act. If we are to end \nhunger, we must work to address its root causes. Being successful in \nthis mission will require that we are innovative and find new ways of \ndoing things. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues \nin Congress and groups in Oregon to win this fight.\n\n\n                            Upward Mobility\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, before speaking on what I want to address \nto the Senate, and that is the pending business on the nominee, I want \nto bring to the attention of my colleagues an excellent editorial in \nthe New York Times today: ``Crushing Upward Mobility.'' It is basically \nan analysis of a regulation that was put forward by the Department of \nEducation that will save the Department of Education some resources, \nbut at the cost of those middle-class families, working families, who \nare eligible for student loan programs. That is not the direction in \nwhich we should be going.\n  At the current time, we have a number of these young students who are \npaying 9.5 percent on guaranteed student loans. Can you imagine having \na deal like that? You put out money and the Federal Government \nguarantees that you have nothing to lose, and it still costs these \nstudents 9.5 percent. We ought to be doing something about that, like \ntaking the profits and making a difference in terms of lowering the \nburden on working families and middle-income families who are trying to \nhelp their children go on to college, rather than put more burden on \nthem.\n  This is an excellent article. I ask unanimous consent that the \neditorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [From the New York Times]\n\n                        Crushing Upward Mobility\n\n       The United States is rapidly abandoning a long-standing \n     policy aimed at keeping college affordable for all Americans \n     who qualify academically. Thanks to a steep decline in aid to \n     poor and working-class students and lagging state support for \n     the public college systems that grant more than two-thirds of \n     the nation's degrees, record numbers of Americans are being \n     priced out of higher education. This is an ominous trend, \n     given that the diploma has become the minimum price of \n     admission to the new economy.\n       Greg Winter of The Times reported yesterday that the \n     federal government has rejiggered the formula that determines \n     how much families have to pay out of pocket before they \n     become eligible for the student aid package, which consists \n     of grants and low-interest loans. The new formula, which will \n     save the government about $300 million in federal aid under \n     the Pell program, will cause some lower-income students to \n     lose federal grants entirely. The families of others will \n     have to put up more money before they can qualify for \n     financial aid. Perversely, single-parent household will have \n     to pay more than two-parent households before they become \n     eligible.\n       The federal Pell Grant program, which is aimed at making \n     college possible for poor and working-class students, has \n     fallen to a small fraction of its former value. The states, \n     meanwhile, have trimmed aid to public colleges, partly as a \n     consequence of soaring Medicaid costs. The states have \n     deepened the problem by shifting need-based tuition to \n     middle-class and upper-class students under the guise of \n     handing out so-called merit scholarships.\n       The political clamor around the new formula is likely to \n     lead to changes, but they will be aimed at upper-income \n     families who are most able to pay. Tinkering with formulas in \n     Washington will not solve this problem. The nation as a whole \n     has been disinvesting in higher education at a time when \n     college has become crucial to work force participation and to \n     the nation's ability to meet the challenges of global \n     economic competition.\n       Until the country renews its commitment to making college \n     affordable for everyone, the American dream of upward \n     mobility through education will be in danger of dying out.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I intend to introduce later on in the \nafternoon the technical language and legislation that will block that \nparticular provision by the Department of Education from going into \neffect.\n  Mr. President, Janice Rogers Brown's nomination to the DC Circuit is \nopposed more strongly by civil rights organizations than almost any \nother nominee I can recall to the Federal courts of appeals.\n  She is opposed by respected civil rights leaders, including Julian \nBond, the chairman of the NAACP, and Reverend Joseph Lowery, president \nemeritus of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, who worked \nwith Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in the civil rights movement, and who \nhas fought tirelessly for many years to make civil rights a reality for \nall Americans.\n  Her nomination is also opposed by the Congressional Black Caucus, the \nNational Bar Association, the Coalition of Black Trade Unions, the \nCalifornia Association of Black Lawyers, and Delta Sigma Theta \nSorority, the second oldest sorority founded by African-American women.\n  Justice Brown's nomination is opposed by Dorothy Height, president \nemeritus of the National Council of Negro Women, and a leader in the \nbattle for equality for women and African Americans. Dr. Height has \ndedicated her life to fighting for equal opportunities for all \nAmericans. She is universally respected by Republicans and Democrats, \nand last year she received the Congressional Gold Medal, and President \nBush joined Members of Congress in honoring her service.\n  In opposing Justice Brown's nomination, Dr. Height says:\n\n       I have always championed and applauded the progress of \n     women, and especially African American women; but I cannot \n     stand by and be silent when a jurist with a record of \n     performance of California Supreme Court Justice Janice Rogers \n     Brown is nominated to a Federal court, even though she is an \n     African American woman. In her speeches and decisions, \n     Justice Janice Rogers Brown has articulated positions that \n     weaken the civil rights legislation and progress that I and \n     others have fought so long and hard to achieve.\n\n  Justice Brown's nomination is opposed equally strongly by over 100 \nother organizations, including 24 in California, representing seniors, \nworking families, and citizens concerned about corporate abuses and the \nenvironment.\n  Some of Justice Brown's supporters suggest that she should be \nconfirmed because she is an African-American woman with a compelling \npersonal story. While all of us respect her ability to rise above \ndifficult circumstances, we cannot confirm nominees to lifetime \npositions on the Federal courts because of their backgrounds. We have a \nconstitutional duty to confirm only those who would uphold the law and \nwould decide cases fairly and reject those who would issue decisions \nbased on personal ideology.\n\n  It is clear why this nomination is so vigorously opposed by those who \ncare about civil rights. Her record leaves no doubt that she would \nattempt to impose her own extreme views on people's everyday lives \ninstead of following the law. The courts are too important to allow \nsuch persons to become lifetime appointees as Federal judges.\n  Janice Rogers Brown's record makes clear that she is a judicial \nactivist and would roll back not only civil rights but laws that \nprotect public safety, workers' rights, and the environment, as well as \nlaws that limit corporate abuse, which are precisely the cases the DC \nCircuit hears most often.\n  Our decision on this nomination is profoundly important to America's \neveryday life. All Americans, wherever they live, should be concerned \nabout such a nomination to the DC Circuit, which interprets Federal \nlaws that protect our civil liberties, worker safety, our ability to \nbreathe clean air and drink clean water in our communities.\n  The DC Circuit is the crown jewel of Federal appellate courts and has \noften been the stepping stone to the Supreme Court. It has a unique \nrole among the Federal courts in interpreting Federal power. Although \nlocated here in the District of Columbia, its decisions have national \nreach because it has exclusive\n\n[[Page S6134]]\n\njurisdiction over many laws that protect consumers' rights, employees' \nrights, civil rights, and the environment. Only the DC Circuit can \nreview the national drinking water standards under the Safe Drinking \nWater Act to ensure clean water for our children. Only the DC Circuit \ncan review national air quality standards under the Clean Air Act to \ncombat pollution in our communities. This court also hears the lion's \nshare of cases involving the rights of workers under the Occupational \nSafety and Health Act which helps ensure that working Americans are not \nexposed to hazardous conditions on the job. It has a large number of \ncases under the National Labor Relations Act. As a practical matter, \nbecause the Supreme Court can review only a small number of lower court \ndecisions, the judges on the DC Circuit often have the last word on \nthese important rights.\n  Because of the court's importance to issues that affect so many \nlives, the Senate should take special care in appointing judges for \nlifetime positions on the DC Circuit. We must be completely confident \nthat appointees to this prestigious court have the highest \nqualifications and ethical standards and will fairly interpret the \nlaws, particularly laws that protect our basic rights.\n  The important work we do in Congress to improve health care, reform \npublic schools, protect working families, and enforce civil rights is \nundermined if we fail in our responsibility to provide the best \npossible advice and consent on judicial nominations. Needed \nenvironmental laws mean little to a community that cannot enforce them \nin Federal courts. Fair labor laws and civil rights laws mean little if \nwe confirm judges who ignore them.\n  In the 1960s and 1970s, the DC Circuit expanded public access to \nadministrative proceedings and protected the interests of the public \nagainst the egregious actions of many large businesses. It enabled more \nplaintiffs to challenge agency decisions. It held that a religious \ngroup, as a member of the listening public, could oppose the license \nrenewal of a television station accused of racial and religious \ndiscrimination. It held that an organization of welfare recipients was \nentitled to intervene in proceedings before a Federal agency. These \ndecisions empowered individuals and organizations to shine a brighter \nlight on governmental agencies. No longer would these agencies be able \nto ignore the interests of those they were created to protect.\n  But in recent years, the DC Circuit has begun to deny access to the \ncourts. It held that a labor union could not challenge the denial of \nbenefits to its members, a decision later overturned by the Supreme \nCourt. It held that environmental groups are not qualified to seek \nreview of Federal standards under the Clean Air Act. These decisions \nare characteristic of the DC Circuit's flip-flop.\n  After decades of landmark decisions allowing effective implementation \nof important laws and principles, the court now is creating precedence \non labor rights, civil rights, and the environment that will set back \nthese basic principles for years to come. It is, therefore, especially \nimportant to ensure that judges appointed to this important court will \nnot use their position to advance an extreme ideological agenda.\n  Janice Rogers Brown would be exactly that kind of ideological judge. \nHow can we confirm someone to the DC Circuit who is hostile to civil \nrights, to workers' rights, to consumer protections, to governmental \nactions that protect the environment and the public in so many other \nareas--the very issues that predominate in the DC Circuit? How can we \nconfirm someone who is so deeply opposed to the core protections that \nthe DC Circuit is required to enforce? It is hard to imagine a worse \nchoice for the DC Circuit.\n\n  Perhaps most disturbing is the contempt she has repeatedly expressed \nfor the very idea of democratic self-government. She has stated that \nwhere government moves in, community retreats, and civil society \ndisintegrates. She has said that government leads to families under \nsiege, war in the streets. In her view, when government advances, \nfreedom is imperiled, and civilization itself is jeopardized. These \nviews could hardly be further from legal mainstream. They are not the \nviews of someone who should be confirmed to the second most important \ncourt in the land and the court with the highest frequency of cases \ninvolving governmental action. Congress and the White House are the \nplaces you go to change the law, not the Federal courts.\n  She has criticized the New Deal which gave us Social Security, the \nminimum wage, and the fair labor laws. She questioned whether age \ndiscrimination laws benefit the public interest. She has even said that \ntoday's senior citizens blithely cannibalize their children because \nthey have the right to get as much free stuff as the political system \nwill permit them to extract. No one with these views should be \nconfirmed to any Federal court, and certainly not to the Federal court \nmost responsible for cases respecting governmental action. It is no \nwonder that an organization seeking to dismantle Social Security is \nrunning ads supporting her nomination to the second most powerful court \nin the country.\n  Of course, like every nominee who comes before the Senate, Justice \nBrown assures us that she will follow the law. But merely saying so is \nnot enough when there is clear and extensive evidence to the contrary. \nThe Senate is more than a rubberstamp in the judicial confirmation \nprocess. We must examine the record and vote our conscience.\n  Justice Brown and her supporters ask us to believe that her contempt \nfor the role of government and government regulation and her opinions \nagainst workers' rights and consumer protections are not an indication \nof how she would act as a Federal judge. It is hard to believe that \nanyone would repeatedly use such extreme rhetoric and not mean it. It \nis even harder to believe that her carelessness and intemperance \nsomehow qualify her to be a Federal judge.\n  Moreover, Justice Brown's decisions match her extreme rhetoric. She \nhas written opinions that would undermine these basic protections. I \nwas especially troubled by her opinion in a case in which ethnic slurs \nhave been proven to create hostile working conditions for Latino \nworkers. Justice Brown wrote that the first amendment prevents courts \nfrom stopping ethnic slurs in the workplace even when those slurs \ncreate a hostile work environment, in violation of job discrimination \nlaws.\n  Her opinion even went beyond the State law involved in the case and \nsuggested that title VII and other Federal antidiscrimination laws may \nnot prohibit this kind of harassment in the workplace. Her opinion \ncontradicts decades of precedent protecting workers from harassment \nbased on race, gender, ethnicity, and religion. Fortunately, a majority \nof California's Supreme Court disagreed with her views.\n  We cannot risk giving Justice Brown a lifetime appointment to a court \non which she will have a greater opportunity to apply her extreme views \non our Federal civil rights laws. This Nation has made too much \nprogress toward our shared goal of equal opportunity to risk appointing \na judge who will roll back civil rights.\n  Other opinions by Justice Brown would have prevented victims of age \nand race discrimination from obtaining relief in State court. She \ndissented from a holding that victims of discrimination may obtain \ndamages from administrative agencies for their emotional distress. Time \nand again, she has issued opinions that would cut back on laws that \nrein in corporate special interests. When there is a choice between \nprotecting the interests of working Americans and siding with big \nbusiness, Janice Rogers Brown sides with big business, and she does so \nin ways that go far beyond the mainstream conservative thinking.\n  She wrote an opinion striking down a State fee requiring paint \ncompanies to pay for screening and treating children exposed to lead \npaint. Most of us are familiar with the dangers of lead paint. It is a \ncontributing cause to mental retardation with regards to children. Many \nof the older communities all over this country have paint that has a \nlead content, and children have a habit of picking off the pieces. Even \nif it is in playgrounds, they have a way of ingesting these pieces. We \nfind that children develop severe illness and sickness and in too many \ninstances mental retardation. We tried here for years to eliminate the \nissues of lead in paint.\n\n[[Page S6135]]\n\nWe have made some important progress.\n  As I understand it, one of the proposals was a small State fee \nrequiring paint companies to pay for screening and treating children \nexposed to lead paint, and she struck down that State fee. Fortunately, \nshe was unanimously reversed by the California Supreme Court. But \nbecause the United States Supreme Court hears so few cases, there is no \nguarantee that her mistakes will be corrected if she receives a \nlifetime position on the DC court.\n  In another case, she wrote a dissent urging the California Supreme \nCourt to strike down a San Francisco law providing housing assistance \nto low-income elderly and disabled people.\n  Justice Brown has also clearly demonstrated her willingness to ignore \nestablished precedent. She wrote a dissent, arguing that the California \nSupreme Court ``cannot simply cloak ourselves in the doctrine of stare \ndecisis,'' which is the rule that judges should follow the settled law. \nThat is the basic concept of upholding the law, interpreting law, stare \ndecisis, following the law which currently exists.\n  She wrote a dissent urging the California Supreme Court, saying we \ncannot simply cloak ourselves in that doctrine.\n  She again showed her willingness to disregard legal precedent just \nthis year. In People v. Robert Young, Justice Brown tried to overturn a \nprecedent protecting the rights of racial minorities and women not to \nbe eliminated from juries for discriminatory reasons. In a concurring \nopinion not joined by any of her colleagues, she criticized the \nprecedent stating that for the purposes of deciding whether a \nprosecuting attorney had discriminated in selecting a jury, black women \ncould not be considered a separate group. The California Supreme Court \nhad held two decades ago that prosecutors may not exclude jurors solely \nbecause they are black women.\n  Justice Brown argued that this precedent should be overruled because \nshe saw no evidentiary basis that black women might be the victims of a \nunique type of group discrimination justifying their designation as a \ncognizable group.\n  It is not just Senate Democrats who are troubled about the record of \nJanice Rogers Brown. Conservatives have also expressed concern about \nthe judicial activism of Janice Rogers Brown. The conservative \npublication National Review had this to say:\n\n       Janice Rogers Brown . . . has said that judicial activism \n     is not troubling per se; what matters is the ``worldview'' of \n     the judicial activist. If a liberal nominee to the courts \n     said similar things, conservatives would make short work \n     of her.\n\n  Even conservative columnist George Will has said that Janice Rogers \nBrown is out of the mainstream.\n  In the past, some members of the press, and even some in Congress, \nhave accused us of bias when we raise questions about a nominee. That \nis nonsense. Justice Brown has received the same treatment as other \nnominees. We have asked about her record, looked at her statements, and \nreviewed her opinions. We have raised questions when her record cast \ndoubt on her commitment to the rule of law.\n  During the recent debate on judicial nominees, almost all of us, \nRepublicans and Democrats, have emphasized that we want an independent \njudiciary. If that is truly what we believe, we must vote no on the \nnomination of Janice Rogers Brown. She opposes many of our society's \nmost basic values shared by both Republicans and Democrats.\n  Throughout its history, America has embraced the ideals of fairness, \nopportunity, and justice. We all believe our laws are there to help \nensure everyone can share in the American dream and that everyone \nshould be free from discrimination. Janice Rogers Brown has expressed \nhostility to some of the protections most important to the American \npeople, including those that protect workers, civil rights, and the \nenvironment. We believe that judges should be impartial, not beholden \nto powerful corporate interests. If we believe in these basic \nprotections, it makes no sense to confirm a judge who would undermine \nthem and turn back the clock on many of our most basic rights.\n  The Senate's role in confirming judges to the Federal courts is one \nof our most important responsibilities under the Constitution. We count \non Federal judges to be openminded, fair, and respect the rule of law. \nDespite what Justice Brown thinks, laws passed by Congress to give \nGovernment a role in protecting the environment, immigrants, workers, \nconsumers, public health and safety, have helped to make America a \nstronger, better, and more fair country. A nominee so deeply hostile to \nso many basic laws does not deserve to be appointed to such an \nimportant Federal court.\n  Last month, we celebrated the 51st anniversary of the Supreme Court's \nlandmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education. Nothing can be a more \nimportant reminder of the role of our courts in upholding individual \nrights. In confirming Federal judges, we must ensure that they will \nuphold the progress our country has made in so many areas, especially \nin civil rights.\n  Justice Brown's record and her many intemperate statements give me no \nconfidence that she will do so, and I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst her nomination.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             Birth Control\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today is a very important day in American \nhistory. On June 7, 1965, 40 years ago today, the U.S. Supreme Court \nstruck down a Connecticut law making it a crime to use or prescribe any \nform of birth control or even to give advice about birth control. Forty \nyears ago it was a crime to prescribe any form of birth control in the \nState of Connecticut, or to use it, or to give advice about it: 40 \nyears ago.\n  It is hard to imagine, isn't it? Even married couples in Connecticut \ncould be convicted of a crime, fined, and sentenced to up to a year in \nprison for using forms of birth control. Doctors who prescribed \ncontraceptives, pharmacists who filled the prescriptions, even people \nwho simply provided advice about birth control, could be charged with \naiding and abetting a crime, fined, and sent to prison for up to a \nyear.\n  But 40 years ago today, just across the street, by a vote of 7 to 2, \nthe Supreme Court struck down the Connecticut law. The case was called \nGriswold v. Connecticut, a famous case. The Court's ruling held for the \nfirst time in our Nation's history that the Constitution guarantees all \nAmericans the right to privacy in family planning decisions. Such \ndecisions were so intensely personal, their consequences so profound, \nthe Court said the State, the Government, may not intrude, it may not \nimpose its will upon others.\n  You can search our Constitution, every single word of it, as short a \ndocument as it is, and never find the word ``privacy'' in this \ndocument. Yet the Supreme Court said they believed the concept of our \nprivacy was built into our rights, our individual rights and liberties.\n  I referred briefly to this landmark ruling earlier today in remarks \nopposing the nomination of Janice Rogers Brown to serve as a Federal \ncircuit court judge in the District of Columbia. That nomination is \nbefore the Senate at this moment. It is for a lifetime appointment. \nJanice Rogers Brown is a justice in the California Supreme Court who \nhas stated explicitly her own personal philosophy, her own judicial \nphilosophy, and it runs counter to many of the concepts and values I \nwill be discussing as part of this commemoration of the Griswold \ndecision.\n  I am glad there is a bipartisan resolution sponsored by my colleague \nfrom Illinois, Senator Barack Obama, and Senator Olympia Snowe of \nMaine, calling on the Senate to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the \nGriswold decision. In that resolution, my two colleagues, one Democrat, \none Republican, ask the Senate to renew its commitment to make sure \nthat all women, including poor women, have access to affordable, \nreliable, safe family planning.\n  Right at the heart of the Griswold decision, the right to make the \nmost intimate personal decisions about our lives in private, without \nGovernment\n\n[[Page S6136]]\n\ninterference, we find the foundation for future decisions that expanded \nreproductive rights. In 1972, in Eisenstadt v. Baird, the Supreme Court \ngranted unmarried people in America access to family planning and \ncontraception--1972--and, in 1973, the famous case, Roe v. Wade, a 7-\nto-2 decision by the Supreme Court said that women have a fundamental \nright to decide whether to continue a pregnancy, depending on the state \nof the pregnancy. Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun was nominated to \nserve on the Supreme Court by Richard Nixon--obviously a Republican \nPresident. Justice Blackmun had been on the Court less than a year and \na half when he was assigned to write the majority opinion in Roe v. \nWade.\n  There is a brilliant new biography called ``Becoming Justice \nBlackmun'' by Linda Greenhouse. I finished it and recommend it to my \ncolleagues. Justice Blackmun served on the Court at several different \nlevels and kept copious notes. From those notes, which were donated, \nthey have derived this biography, which I recommend to anyone, \nregardless of your political background, to understand what happens \nbehind those closed doors at the Supreme Court.\n  Justice Blackmun revealed in this book how he struggled with the \nassignment of writing the majority opinion on Roe v. Wade. You see, he \nhad been the general counsel for the Mayo Clinic, one of the most \noutstanding hospitals in America, which happens to be in the State of \nour Presiding Officer, Minnesota, in Rochester. So Justice Blackmun \nleft Washington and went back to the library of the Mayo Clinic as he \nwrote this decision. He worked for long periods of time, plowing \nthrough books and articles on the whole question of abortion. He \nlistened to a lot of people, including his own daughter, who dropped \nout of college in her sophomore year after becoming pregnant.\n  In his notes for the Roe decision, Justice Blackmun made two \npredictions. Here is what he said. The Court will be excoriated at \nfirst for its decision. Then, he went on to say, there will be an \nunsettled period for a while as States brought their laws into \ncompliance with the Roe v. Wade decision.\n  The first prediction proved accurate; the second, overly optimistic. \nThirty-two years after the Roe decision, 40 years after the Griswold \ndecision, America today remains unsettled, not only about reproductive \nrights, but about many other fundamental matters of conscience as well. \nWe are struggling today with a question that is as old as our democracy \nitself: What is the appropriate, what is the proper relationship \nbetween personal religious belief and public policy? How many battles, \nhow many debates do we struggle through that go to that single issue? \nWhen should one group in America be able to impose its own moral code \non the rest of society?\n\n  It is worth remembering that the Griswold decision overturned \nConnecticut's version of a Federal law called the Comstock Act. In 20 \nyears on Capitol Hill, I have never heard anyone refer to the Comstock \nAct. Listen to the history. This law was named after its author, \nAnthony Comstock, a morals crusader and a zealot anti-abortion \nadvocate.\n  In 1868, Anthony Comstock was the driving force behind a State anti-\nobscenity law in New York. In 1873, he brought his crusade to \nWashington. He lobbied Congress to pass a Federal law making it a crime \nto advertise or mail not only ``every lewd, lascivious, or filthy book, \npamphlet, picture, paper, letter, writing, print, or other publication \nof an indecent character'' but also any information ``for preventing \nconception or producing abortion.''\n  Congress passed the Comstock law unanimously, with little debate. It \nthen commissioned--this is something I find almost hard to believe--it \ncommissioned Anthony Comstock as a special agent of the U.S. Post \nOffice, gave him the power under the law to define what should be \nbanned in America, and also vested in Mr. Comstock the power of arrest \nand gave him a huge travel budget. Imagine that: Mr. Comstock spent the \nnext 30 years crisscrossing America, enforcing his law as he saw fit.\n  Two years before he died in 1915, Anthony Comstock bragged that he \nhad been personally responsible for the criminal conviction of enough \npeople to fill a 61-car passenger train. He prosecuted Margaret Sanger, \nthe family planning pioneer, on eight counts of obscenity because she \npublished articles on birth control. Druggists were punished and \ncriminalized for giving out information to Americans about family \nplanning and contraception. Publishers revised their texts and books so \nas to avoid the wrath of Mr. Comstock and his law, deleting banned \nwords such as ``pregnant,'' and Americans lived with his censorship of \nthe mail.\n  The Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw dismissed the Comstock Act \nas ``a standing joke at the expense of the United States.'' There was \nnothing funny about the Comstock Act, nothing funny to those who were \nforced by the law to conform with Anthony Comstock's rigid personal \nmoral code. The penalty for violating the Comstock Act was up to 5 \nyears in prison at hard labor and a fine of up to $2,000. For every \nvictim who was prosecuted, there were untold others whose lives, \nhealth, and family suffered as a result of being denied basic \ninformation about family planning.\n  Linn Duvall Harwell is one of those who suffered. Miss Harwell now \nlives in New Hampshire. She is 82 years old. In 1929, when she was 6 \nyears old, her mother, who was then 34 and pregnant for the eighth \ntime, lost her life. She tried to abort her own pregnancy using \nknitting needles and bled to death, leaving behind a husband and five \nsmall children. Linn Duvall Harwell has spent her life trying to spare \nother women her mother's fate by protecting women's right to safe and \nlegal contraception and abortion.\n  In 1958, Linn Harwell moved to Connecticut. A woman at her church \nasked her to volunteer for Planned Parenthood. She and other young \nmothers were trained in medical understanding of birth control by \nEstelle Griswold, the director of Planned Parenthood in Connecticut, \nand Charles Lee Buxton, the league's medical director. These were the \ntwo people who brought the lawsuit that later became the Griswold case \nbefore the Supreme Court. Years before the Court struck down \nConnecticut's Comstock law, Linn Duvall Harwell defied the law to teach \npoor women in housing projects about birth control and family planning.\n  Yesterday, the Chicago Sun-Times carried an article written by Miss \nHarwell about her life's work and the renewed threats today to the \nrights identified in Griswold and Roe. In her op-ed, Miss Harwell \nrecalled a woman she met in 1968 named Rosie. Rosie was 32 years old. \nShe and her husband, a short-order cook, were the parents of 11 \nchildren.\n\n  Miss Harwell wrote:\n\n       By the time I met Rosie and her family, I could not help \n     her, for she had so many children already. She and her family \n     were imprisoned in poverty because she was unable to access \n     the preventive medicine that I easily obtained.\n\n  She added:\n\n       The Comstock law denied health care to millions of Rosies \n     because of religious bigotry, legalized injustice and \n     ignorance.\n\n  Today, it is estimated that 95 percent of American women will use \nbirth control during their childbearing years. Reliable birth control \nis now a critical part of preventive health care for women. And Roe, \nalthough it has been weakened, is still the law of the land.\n  The widespread use of birth control has helped reduce maternal and \ninfant mortality by an astonishing two-thirds in the last 40 years. \nSince Griswold, we have reduced infant and maternal mortality in \nAmerica by two-thirds. In 1999, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention included family planning on the list of ``Ten Great \nPublic Health Achievements in the 20th Century.''\n  But Comstockery seems to be making a return. You can see it in \nefforts to impose gag rules on doctors and other measures designed to \nmake it harder for women to get information and services related to \nfamily planning and abortion. You can see it in the stories of women \nwho are harassed by pharmacists when they attempt to fill prescriptions \nfor contraceptives--in some cases, even after these women have been \nvictims of sexual assault.\n  A chill wind blows for reproductive rights and possibly other issues \nof conscience as well. You can hear that wind in the rhetoric of \nextremists who rail\n\n[[Page S6137]]\n\nabout the ``culture war'' in America and misrepresent legitimate \npolitical debate as attacks on people of faith.\n  We heard the chill wind of religious intolerance in some of the sad \ndebate over the tragedy of Terri Schiavo. We heard it in the dangerous, \nvitriolic condemnations of judges, like George Greer, the judge in the \nSchiavo case, who dared to enforce the law as he believed the \nConstitution required.\n  We can hear that chill wind of religious and social intolerance today \nin the debate over stem cell research. Once again, as with the Comstock \nlaws, a passionate group who sees itself as the moral guardians of \nAmerica would use the power of our Government to deny life-saving \nmedical care to those who need it. They believe that a cell blastocyst \ndeserves the same legal standing and protections as a full-grown child \nor adult suffering from Parkinson's or diabetes or terrible injury to \ntheir spinal cords. I respect their opinion. I respect their religious \nbeliefs. In most cases, I don't share them. Neither do most Americans. \nI don't believe this vocal minority, no matter how well intentioned \nthey may be, no matter how moral they believe themselves to be, should \nhave a veto power over medical research that offers apparently \nunlimited potential to heal broken bodies and minds and save lives.\n  Will our courts continue to recognize the constitutional right to \nprivacy on family planning and other profoundly personal issues? Or \nwill we fill the Federal bench with judicial activists who see \nthemselves as soldiers in a cultural war, who want to put their own \nagendas ahead of the Constitution? That is one of the questions that is \nat the heart of the debate on the Federal judges.\n  The filibuster debate is not about old Senate rules. It is about \nwhether self-described cultural warriors can use our Government to \nimpose their personal moral agenda on America.\n  In April, a group of organizations held a televised rally to condemn \nthe Senate filibuster rule as a weapon against people of faith. They \ncalled it ``Justice Sunday.'' That day, Janice Rogers Brown, the \nnominee now before the Senate, gave a speech in which she argued that \n``people of faith are embroiled in a war against secular humanists.'' \nAccording to newspaper accounts, she went on to say:\n\n       [T]here seems to have been no time since the Civil War that \n     this country was so bitterly divided. It's not a shooting \n     war, but it's a war.\n\n  Mr. President, Americans are not at war with one another. We are at \nwar in Afghanistan and Iraq, wars, sadly, fueled by religious extremism \nin many respects. Expressing honest, fundamental differences of opinion \non political and social questions here at home is not an act of war. It \nis an act of democracy. It is our democratic process and our \nConstitution at work.\n  I respect the right of every person to express his or her beliefs \nabout religion or anything else. That is part of the beauty of being a \ncitizen in this great Nation. But we cannot allow the beliefs of a \nmajority, or even a vocal minority, to determine moral choices for \nevery American. As the Supreme Court ruled so wisely 40 years ago, \nthere are decisions that are so intensely private that the Government \nhas no right to intrude.\n  Soon I hope we take up the issue which the House considered just \nseveral days ago on stem cell research. It strikes me as strange, maybe \nunfair, that some believe we should oppose in vitro fertilization in \nevery circumstance. I have friends of my family, friends for years, who \nhave spent small fortunes in the hopes that a mother and father who \ncannot conceive by natural means can use this process to have a child \nwhom they will rear and love all of their lives. One of my friends has \nspent $80,000 in two separate, thank goodness successful, efforts, and \nshe has two beautiful children to show for it.\n  I cannot imagine why that is an immoral act, when a husband and wife \nwill go to those extremes to bring a life into this world that they \nwill love and nurture. But we know, just as in normal conception, there \nwill be, during the process, some of the fertilized eggs that will not \nlodge in a mother's womb and lead to human life. That is the natural \nthing that occurs.\n  The same thing happens during in vitro fertilization. If they are \nsuccessful in creating this fertilized egg, and then implanting it in a \nwoman's womb so she can have a baby, it is a miracle, but as part of \nthat miracle there will be some of these fertilized eggs which cannot \nbe used.\n  So the question before us in stem cell research is very clear: Should \nstem cells from blastocysts be used to save others' lives, to prevent \ndisease, to give someone hope and a future? That is what it is about. \nThere are some who say no, some who would say we should not allow in \nvitro fertilization, and others who say, if you allow it, you should \nnever allow those discarded blastocysts to be used for medical \nresearch.\n  The position of the Bush administration is close to that. The \nPresident, in August of 2001, said he would approve certain stem cell \nlines being used for research but no others. Well, it turns out those \nstem cell lines were very limited in their number and quality, and \nscientists and medical researchers have told us that the President's \napproach is not going to give us the opportunity we need to develop \nthese stem cells into cures for diseases. So many of us believe we \nshould move forward.\n  We should have strict rules against cloning. I do not know of a \nsingle Member of Congress, of either political party, who supports \nhuman cloning. We are all opposed to that. It should be condemned, and \nwe should have strict ethical guidelines on the use of these stem cells \nso that they are used legitimately for research, not for profit or \ncommercialization, but legitimately used for research to try to find \nthe cures to these vexing diseases.\n  Many of us believe that this is as pro-life as it gets. If you can \ntake stem cells that would be otherwise discarded and never used for \nany purpose and use them for the purpose of giving a youngster who has \nto inject with insulin three times a day a chance to be rid of \ndiabetes, if you can use it for a person afflicted in their forties or \nfifties with Parkinson's disease, which is a progressively degenerative \ndisease in most instances, if you can use it to try to regenerate the \nspinal column and all the things that are necessary so someone can walk \nagain after a spinal cord injury--how in the world can that be wrong?\n  That strikes me as promoting life. Yet some will come to the floor, \neven threatening a filibuster, saying that we cannot do this because it \nviolates their personal moral and religious beliefs. Well, I understand \nthat. And that is how they should vote. But to stop the rest of the \nNation--because of their personal moral and religious beliefs--from \nthis type of medical research seems to me to be counterproductive, if \nyou are truly committed to life and the health of those who surround \nus.\n  Forty years ago, the decision was made across the street that there \nare certain elements of privacy, there are certain elements of personal \ndecisions made by individuals and families which the State, the \nGovernment cannot overrule because of anyone's personal religious, \nmoral belief. They said that privacy is critically important in \nAmerica. Those private decisions should be protected.\n  Every nominee for the Supreme Court I have heard in recent times has \nfaced a Judiciary Committee question from some member, Democrat or \nRepublican: Do you still agree with the Griswold v. Connecticut \ndecision? Do you still believe that, even though this Constitution does \nnot include the word ``privacy,'' that is part of what we have as \nAmericans as part of our individual rights and liberties? The only one \nwho tried to, I guess, split the difference and find some way to argue \naround it was Robert Bork. His nomination was ill-fated after he made \nsome of those statements.\n  I believe most Americans feel we should be personally responsible, \nthat we should be allowed to have our own personal religious beliefs, \nbut they also think we should stay away from the Government imposing \nreligious beliefs on one group or the other. That is what happened with \nthe Comstock laws. That is what led to the laws in Connecticut, which \nwere stricken in Griswold. Sadly, that is part of the debate today when \nit comes to stem cell research.\n\n  I am urging Senator Frist, a medical doctor, one I greatly respect, \nto bring this bill up and bring it up quickly. I know there is a \nfeeling by the White\n\n[[Page S6138]]\n\nHouse, and maybe even by some in Congress, that we should avoid this \nstem cell research debate. But when you think of the millions of \nAmericans and their families who are counting on us to move medical \nresearch forward, is there anything more important on our political \nagenda?\n  I sincerely hope President Bush, who made an exception for some stem \ncell lines for research, will understand that you cannot take an \nabsolute position on this issue. It is a tough issue. It is one where \nwe should draw good, ethical guidelines for the use of this research, \nbut not prohibit it, not close the door to this research and the cures \nthat could emanate from it. That, I think, would be a lesson well \nlearned, a lesson consistent with the decision made by the Supreme \nCourt 40 years ago today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to get us back on the \ntopic at hand. It is a topic that has been denied for some period of \ntime. It is the Honorable Janice Rogers Brown nomination to the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the DC Circuit. ``Justice delayed is justice \ndenied'' is an old saying under the law. This lady has been delayed a \nlong time. It is time to get this nomination through.\n  I am glad to see the cloture vote move us forward. She is going to be \nnow approved, I believe, by a majority vote and a majority opinion. And \nI think if the country had to vote on Janice Rogers Brown, it would be \na 90-plus percent vote for this lady, given her background, given her \njudicial expertise, given her demeanor, given her nature.\n  I think the country would look at this lady, whom I have a picture of \nhere, and say: That is the type of person I want on the bench. This is \na good, honorable person, with a great heart, a well-trained mind, who \nis thoughtful, with great experience. This is the type of person we \nought to have on the bench. Yet we have just heard litany after litany \nof excuses, the dissecting of cases that you try to then parse to say \nshe should not be on the bench for whatever reason.\n  I want to go through some of what has been stated previously. I want \nto go through, again, her background to get us back on topic. And then \nI want to go through some of the specifics.\n  She is currently serving as an associate justice on the California \nSupreme Court. She has held that position since 1996. She is the first \nAfrican-American woman to serve on the State's highest court. She was \nretained with 76 percent of the vote in the last election. Certainly, \nthat does not seem to be the sort of extreme case anyone can come up \nwith; that 76 percent of Californians think she should be retained on \nthe court. If she is so extreme, if she is so off the mark, if she is \nso out of the mainstream, why, in California, wasn't she voted off the \nbench?\n  Why didn't at least 24 percent of Californians or more than 24 \npercent vote her off the bench? Why didn't she have a much closer \nelection than that? Where is the beef, an old advertising phrase?\n  In 2002, Justice Brown's colleagues relied on her to write the \nmajority opinion for the court more times than any other justice. Prior \nto appointment and confirmation to the California Supreme Court, \nJustice Brown served from 1994 to 1996 as an associate justice on the \nThird District Court of Appeals, an intermediate State appellate court.\n  Justice Brown enjoys bipartisan support from those in California who \nknow her best. A bipartisan group of 15 California law professors has \nwritten to the Senate Judiciary Committee in support of Justice Brown. \nThe letter notes that:\n\n       We know Justice Brown to be a person of high integrity, \n     intelligence, unquestioned integrity, and evenhandedness. \n     Since we have differing political beliefs and perspectives, \n     Democratic, Republican and Independent, we wish especially to \n     emphasize what we believe is Justice Brown's strongest \n     credential for appointment on the D.C. Circuit Court: her \n     open-minded and thorough appraisal of legal argumentation--\n     even when her personal views may conflict with those \n     arguments.\n\n  This is a bipartisan group that says she is open-minded and thorough \nin her appraisal of legal arguments.\n  A bipartisan group of Justice Brown's current and former judicial \ncolleagues has also written a letter in support of her nomination. \nTwelve current and former colleagues noted in a letter to the committee \nthat:\n\n       Much has been written about Justice Brown's humble \n     beginnings, and the story of her rise to the California \n     Supreme Court is truly compelling. But that alone would not \n     be enough to gain our endorsement for a seat on the Federal \n     bench. We believe that Justice Brown is qualified because she \n     is a superb judge. We who have worked with her on a daily \n     basis know her to be extremely intelligent, keenly \n     analytical, and very hard working. We know that she is a \n     jurist who applies the law without favor, without bias and \n     with an even hand.\n\n  This doesn't sound like the same lady who is being discussed on this \nfloor by some of my colleagues on the other side.\n  Ellis Horvitz, a Democrat and one of the deans of the appellate bar \nin California, has written in support of Justice Brown noting that:\n\n        . . . in my opinion, Justice Brown [possesses] those \n     qualities an appellate jurist should have. She is extremely \n     intelligent, very conscientious and hard working, \n     refreshingly articulate, and possessing great common sense \n     and integrity. She is courteous and gracious to the litigants \n     and counsel who appear before her.\n\n  Regis Lane, director of Minorities in Law Enforcement, a coalition of \nethnic minority law enforcement officers in California, wrote:\n\n       We recommend the confirmation of Justice Brown based on her \n     broad range of experience, personal integrity, good standing \n     in the community, and dedication to public service . . . In \n     many conversations with Justice Brown, I have discovered that \n     she is very passionate about the plight of racial minorities \n     in America, based on her upbringing in the south. Justice \n     Brown's views that all individuals who desire the American \n     dream regardless of their race or creed can and should \n     succeed in this country, are consistent with [that group's] \n     mission to ensure brighter futures for disadvantaged youth of \n     color.\n\n  These are some of the people who know her the best. These are the \nstatements they make about her. This is why she should be on the DC \nappellate court.\n  Justice Brown is an outstanding and highly qualified candidate as \nevidenced by her background, credentials, and training. This has been \ncovered and covered. But she is a sharecropper's daughter, born in \nGreenville, AL, in 1949. During her childhood she attended segregated \nschools, came of age in the midst of Jim Crow policies in the South. \nShe grew up listening to her grandmother's stories about NAACP lawyer \nFred Gray, who defended Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Rosa Parks. \nHer experience as a child of the South motivated her desire to be a \nlawyer. Her family moved to Sacramento, CA, when Justice Brown was in \nher teens. She later received a B.A. in economics from California State \nin Sacramento in 1974, and her J.D. from UCLA School of Law in 1977. \nShe also received honorary law degrees from Pepperdine University Law \nSchool, Catholic University, and Southwestern University School of Law.\n  She has dedicated all but 2 years of her 26-year legal career to \npublic service. For only 2 years has she not been in public service, 24 \nyears of public service. Where is the person who is out of the \nmainstream? Where is the person who is irrational? Where is the person \nwho doesn't hold or have the judicial temperament or doesn't have the \nintellect or the open-mindedness to be a judge in all of this? She has \ndedicated most of her life, 24 years, to public service.\n  Prior to more than 8 years as a judge in State courts, Justice Brown \nserved from 1991 to 1994 as legal affairs secretary to California \nGovernor Pete Wilson where she provided legal advice on litigation, \nlegislation, and policy matters. From 1987 to 1990, she served as \ndeputy secretary and general counsel to the California Business, \nTransportation, and Housing Agency where she supervised the State \nbanking, real estate, corporations, thrift, and insurance departments.\n  From 1972 to 1987, she was deputy attorney general of the Office of \nthe California Attorney General where she prepared briefs and \nparticipated in oral arguments on behalf of the State in criminal \nappeals, prosecuted criminal cases, and litigated a variety of civil \nissues. She began her legal career in 1977, when she served 2 years as \ndeputy legislative counsel in the California Legislative Counsel \nBureau. She has a broad base of experience from which to\n\n[[Page S6139]]\n\ndraw to be an excellent person to sit on the Federal appellate court \nbench.\n  She has participated in a variety of statewide and community \norganizations dedicated to improving the quality of life for all \ncitizens of California. Justice Brown has served as a member of the \nCalifornia Commission on the Status of African-American Males--the \ncommission was chaired by now-U.S. Representative Barbara Lee--and made \nrecommendations on how to address inequalities in the treatment of \nAfrican-American males in employment, business development, the \ncriminal justice, and health care systems.\n  She is a member of the Governor's Child Support Task Force, which \nreviewed and made recommendations on how to improve California's child \nsupport enforcement laws. She serves as a member of the Community \nLearning Advisory Board of the Rio Americano High School and developed \nthe Academia Civitas Program to provide government service internships \nto high school students in Sacramento. She has also assisted in the \ndevelopment of a curriculum to teach civics and reinforce the values of \npublic service.\n  She has volunteered time with the Center for Law-Related Education, a \nprogram that uses moot courts and mock trials to teach high school \nstudents how to solve everyday problems. She has taught Sunday school \nclass at Cordova Church of Christ for more than 10 years. That is \nJustice Janice Rogers Brown. Those are the facts. That is who she \nactually is.\n  So why has it taken that long a period of time for us to be able to \nget her to the floor? Why is there such consternation about her \nbecoming a DC appellate court judge? Why have we spent years to get her \nto the point where we will vote on--I would love to see it today, but \nat least this week--her approval to the DC appellate court bench? I \nthink it goes to the fact that she is a lady, nominated by President \nBush, who will strictly construe the Constitution, stay within the \nbounds of the document, not try to write new opinion as to a new \nconstitutional right or a new issue that is not within the Constitution \nor not within the law. She is what lawyers would call a strict \nconstructionist. She says if the law says this--and it was passed to \nsay that--that is what we enforce, if that is what the Constitution \nsays.\n  It is not the living, breathing document of let's try to create \nanother right or privilege here and take three or four of the \namendments to the Constitution, provisions of the Constitution, frame \nthem together, and then let's find a new right in the Constitution \nbecause we think this is good for the country. If it is a change to the \nConstitution that needs to happen, then it should happen. And it should \ngo through this body with a two-thirds vote. It should go through the \nHouse with a two-thirds vote. It should go to the State legislatures \nfor a three-fourths vote. It should not be a majority opinion of a \nbench somewhere.\n  She says she will stay within the confines of the law. That is what \nthe President is trying to nominate, judges who will stay strict \nconstructionists within the confines of the law and be what judges \nshould be, interpreters of the law, enforcers of the Constitution as it \nis written, not as they wish it were written. That is what this \nnomination is about.\n  Others want to see a court that will expand and look and read \ndifferent things in, even if it doesn't pass through this body or \ndoesn't pass through the legislature or isn't signed into law by the \nPresident. We really are at a point of what it is that the judiciary is \nto be about in America. You are seeing the face of somebody who is a \nstrict constructionist, saying that this is what it is about.\n  The judiciary has a role. It has a constitutional role. It is an \nextraordinarily important role. But it is defined and it is set. She \nbelieves it should stay within. That is why we have had so much trouble \nwith so many of these judicial nominations.\n  During the first 4 years of the Presidency of George W. Bush, the \nSenate accumulated the worst circuit court confirmation record in \nmodern times, thanks to partisan obstruction. Only 35 of President \nBush's 52 circuit court nominees were confirmed, a confirmation rate of \n67 percent. To give you a comparison on that:\n  People have said that is not so low; we approved a number of these \nlower court judges. But let's take President Johnson's term in office. \nThere was a Democrat Senate and a Democrat President. What was his \ncircuit court nomination rate? It was 95 percent.\n  President Bush: Republican Senate, Republican Presidency, 67 percent.\n  What about President Carter? Democratic President, Democratic Senate, \nand 93 percent of his circuit court nominees were approved.\n  President Bush: 67 percent.\n  What has taken place is a filibuster of good people, such as Janice \nRogers Brown, who has served honorably most of her professional career \nin public service but does believe there are confines within which they \nrule. It is in the Constitution or it is not; it is in the law or it is \nnot; it is constitutional or it is not. It is not what I wish it were, \nit is what is actually there. It is what the precedents have said that \nmatters.\n  The average American may not be familiar with Senate rules on cloture \nor on the unprecedented low confirmation rate of President Bush's \ncircuit court nominees, but the average American can tell you one \nthing: that the Constitution and common sense require the Government to \nbe accountable to the people for its actions. This is especially the \ncase of what we do in the House and the Senate as we move forward in \nthis country.\n  I want to address some of the items that have been coming up in some \nof these debates. Various Members have raised specific points, and I \nwant to address a few of those points.\n  Certain liberal special interest groups have tried to distort Janice \nRogers Brown's decision when she served on the State court of appeals \nin the case of Sinclair Paint Company v. Board of Equalization. They \nclaimed she was insensitive to the legislature's desire to protect \nchildren from lead poisoning.\n  What was really at issue in the case was the respect for the will of \nthe California voters who wanted to make it more difficult for the \nCalifornia Legislature to raise taxes.\n  California proposition 13--people remember that--enacted in June of \n1978, requires a two-thirds vote of the legislature to increase State \ntaxes. That is what proposition 13 did. In 1991, the California \nLegislature voted by a simple majority to assess fees on manufacturers \nengaged in commerce involving products containing lead in order to fund \na program to provide education, screening, and medical services for \nchildren at risk for lead poisoning. Justice Brown simply held for a \nunanimous court of appeals--a unanimous court of appeals--in affirming \nthe judgment of the trial court that the assessment constituted a tax \nwithin the meaning of proposition 13 and thus had to be passed by a \ntwo-thirds vote.\n  That seems to be pretty basic and pretty common sense and not about \nher insensitivity to cases involving lead poisoning but simply what her \nrole is under the law and her role as a jurist.\n  Under applicable California case law where payment is exacted solely \nfor revenue purposes and its payment gives the right to carry on the \nbusiness without any further conditions, the payment constitutes a tax. \nThe Childhood Lead Poisoning Protection Act did not require the \nplaintiff to comply with any other conditions. It was merely required \nto pay its share of the program cost. Justice Brown reasonably \nconcluded the assessment was a tax.\n  There are several other cases that have been brought up that I want \nto address.\n  Several liberal interest groups have attacked Justice Brown's dissent \nin Aguilar v. Avis Rent-a-Car Systems in which she argued racial \ndiscrimination in the workplace, even when it rises to the level of \nillegal race discrimination, cannot be prohibited by an injunction \nunder the first amendment. I want to talk about this.\n  Justice Brown, as I have cited, is the daughter of a sharecropper \nfrom rural Alabama. She grew up under the shadow of Jim Crow laws. I \nthink she understands the lingering effects of racial classification. \nIn light of her personal history, the allegation she is insensitive to \ndiscrimination is absurd.\n  Notwithstanding her personal experiences with racism, Judge Brown's \nrole as a judge has been to apply the law which she has done faithfully \nand rigorously. As I discussed earlier, it is the\n\n[[Page S6140]]\n\nrole of the judge to apply the law and apply the Constitution, not \nrewrite the law the way they wish it were, not to rewrite the \nConstitution the way they think it ought to be, but to apply it in a \nparticular case. And this is a case she could have looked at from her \nbackground and said: I understand this situation. I have been in this \nsituation. Yet what does the law itself say?\n  Judge Brown's opinions demonstrate her firm commitment to the bedrock \nprinciple of civil rights. Discrimination on the basis of race is \nillegal, it is immoral, unconstitutional, inherently wrong, and \ndestructive of a democratic society. Those are her statements.\n\n  In the Aguilar case, Justice Brown described the defendants' comments \nas disgusting, offensive, and abhorrent, and she voted to permit a \nlarge damage award under California's fair employment law to stand. Her \ndissent only pertained to an injunction that placed an absolute \nprohibition on speech. This is commonly called a prior restraint which \nmost free speech advocates strenuously oppose.\n  Justice Brown's opinions demonstrate her firm commitment to the first \namendment. She cited a long line of Supreme Court cases for the \nproposition that speech cannot be banned simply because it is \noffensive.\n  Justice Brown's opinions also demonstrate her commitment to equality \nin the workplace. Justice Mosk and Justice Kennard, considered one of \nthe most liberal members of the California Supreme Court, also \ndissented on first amendment grounds.\n  Here we see the core of the person, the commitment to the law and to \nthe rule of law. Here was something she had experienced, she \nunderstood, and yet had to say: OK, what does the law actually say, and \nwhat are the first amendment rights? Then she applied them in the case. \nThat is the type of justice who looks at what is their role and what is \nit that they are required to do under the Constitution.\n  Judge Brown's opinion was so powerful that it prompted one member of \nthe U.S. Supreme Court to take the unusual step of publishing an \nopinion dissenting from the denial of certiorari.\n  I find it amazing that the very same liberal outside groups who never \nhesitate to level accusations of censorship, perhaps, against the \nadministration or even Congress are attacking Justice Brown for \nstanding up for what she interpreted and looked at clearly as a first \namendment issue which she had to stand by even though she found the \ncomments herself so offensive and wrong.\n  Justice Brown has been attacked as being insensitive on women's \nissues because she has voted to strike down a State antidiscrimination \nlaw that provided a contraceptive drug benefit to women. Some have \nclaimed her to be hostile to these women's issues.\n  What one has to do is look at the actual case, the actual facts, the \nactual law in front of her because her role as a justice is to take the \nlaw and the facts applied in this particular case, not what she wished \nit was, not what she hoped it would be, not what she thinks it should \nbe in a perfect world, but what is it.\n  The law involved in the case actually required health and disability \ninsurance policies to cover contraceptives. Justice Brown did not vote \nto strike down the law, she simply argued that the law should not be \napplied to force a religious institution--here Catholic Charities of \nSacramento--to do something that violated its religious beliefs. This \ncase was about religious freedom under the first amendment, not about \ngender discrimination or revisiting the right to contraceptives. It is \nabout discrimination based on religion, and Justice Brown stood against \nthis discrimination. Telling us about this case without saying a word \nabout religious freedom on the issue misinforms people totally about \nthis particular case and this person.\n  Justice Brown has been attacked for rendering opinions that have been \nconsidered outside the mainstream. These allegations are spurious. As I \nhave stated, she has been affirmed by the population, the public voting \nin California, with a 76-percent approval rating. If her opinions are \nso out of the mainstream and so wrong, why weren't more Californians \nthan roughly 25 percent concerned about this?\n  The flip side of this is that I have never won an election by a 75-\npercent margin. I would love to win an election by that margin. This is \na confirmation election. It is different than what we face in the \nSenate.\n  Still, as somebody who has run for elections, when you get up to that \nthree-fourths mark, that is really good, standing in front of the \npublic and asking them to endorse your status, endorse your position, \nparticularly if this allegation were true. If it were true that she is \nway out of the mainstream of public opinion in California and she is \nway out, on a consistent basis, so that her opinions are in the paper \nall the time and they are way out there, contrary to California public \nopinion, would you not think more than 25 percent of Californians would \nsay, I am going to vote against confirming this lady?\n  I think probably a lot of people would look down the ballot box on \njudges and say, Which ones can I vote against because I am used to \nvoting for all of them, particularly if somebody was so out of the \nmainstream on such a consistent basis that she is in the papers all the \ntime about being in this dissent or being overruled in this case, that \nthere would be some recognition of her and more people would be \nconcerned. Yet that is not the case. I submit it is because it is just \nnot true. She is not outside the mainstream.\n  I believe the criticism is utterly baseless. Among the eight justices \nwho served on the California Supreme Court between 1996 and 2003, \nJustice Brown tied with another judge as the author of the second most \nmajority opinions for the court. Only the chief justice wrote more \nmajority opinions. Now, those are her colleagues on the bench saying: \nWe think you are the right person to write this opinion. You are \nexpressing the opinion for most of us. You are a hard worker. You are \nintelligent. You are an excellent wordsmith. These are all traits we \nwould want in a justice.\n  Justice Brown also ranked fourth among the eight justices for the \nnumber of times she dissented alone. This puts her squarely in the \nmiddle, certainly not on either fringe in that category. It is wrong \nfor Justice Brown's opponents to throw out numbers without offering any \nbasis for comparison on her court.\n  I wish to talk about a particular case, the case of People v. McKay. \nJustice Brown stood alone among her colleagues in arguing for the \nexclusion of evidence of drug possession that was discovered after the \ndefendant, Conrad McKay, was arrested for riding his bicycle the wrong \nway on a residential street. Her dissent is remarkable for its pointed \nsuggestion of the possibility that the defendant was a victim of racial \nprofiling.\n  Justice Brown commented:\n\n       Questions have been raised about the disparate impact of \n     stop-and-search procedures of the California Highway Patrol. \n     The practice is so prevalent, it has a name: ``Driving While \n     Black.''\n\n  This is somebody who is insensitive? I do not think that is the case \nwith Justice Brown.\n  I will go on and read from the conclusion of her dissent. She added \nthe following stirring comments:\n\n       In the spring of 1963, civil rights protests in Birmingham \n     united this country in a new way.\n\n  This is a native of Alabama.\n\n       Seeing peaceful protesters jabbed with cattle prods, held \n     at bay by snarling police dogs, and flattened by powerful \n     streams of water from fire hoses galvanized the nation. \n     Without being constitutional scholars, we understood \n     violence, coercion, and oppression.\n\n  These are the words of Justice Janice Rogers Brown. And I continue:\n\n       We understood what constitutional limits are designed to \n     restrain. We reclaimed our constitutional aspirations. What \n     is happening now is more subtle, more diffuse, and less \n     visible, but it is only a difference in degree. If harm is \n     still being done to people because they are black, or brown, \n     or poor, the oppression is not lessened by the absence of \n     television cameras.\n       I do not know Mr. McKay's ethnic background. One thing I \n     would bet on: he was not riding his bike a few doors down \n     from his home in Bel Air, or Brentwood, or Rancho Palos \n     Verdes--places where no resident would be arrested for riding \n     the ``wrong way'' on a bicycle whether he had his driver's \n     license or not. Well . . . it would not get anyone arrested \n     unless he looked like he did not belong in the neighborhood. \n     That is the problem.\n\n  That was her dissenting opinion, a stirring opinion, quoting things \nthat in her growing up and in her childhood\n\n[[Page S6141]]\n\nshe had witnessed. She is very sensitive on racial issues.\n  Last month, Ginger Rutland, who is on the editorial board of the \nSacramento Bee, wrote this in her newspaper about Justice Brown's \njudicial courage:\n\n       I know Janice Rogers Brown, and she knows me, but we're not \n     friends. The associate justice on the California Supreme \n     Court has never been to my house, and I've never been to \n     hers. Ours is a wary relationship, one that befits a \n     journalist of generally liberal leanings and a public \n     official with a hard-right reputation fiercely targeted by \n     the left. . . . I find myself rooting for Brown. I hope \n     she survives the storm and eventually becomes the first \n     black woman on the nation's highest court.\n\n  In describing Justice Brown's position in the McKay case that I \nquoted Justice Brown earlier, Rutland, the editorialist from the \nSacramento Bee, says the following:\n\n       Brown was the lone dissenter. What she wrote should give \n     pause to all my friends who dismiss her as an arch \n     conservative bent on rolling back constitutional rights. In \n     the circumstances surrounding McKay's arrest, the only black \n     judge on the State's highest court saw an obvious and grave \n     injustice that her fellow jurists did not. . . . In her \n     dissent, Brown even lashed out at the U.S. Supreme Court \n     and--pay close attention, my liberal friends--criticized an \n     opinion written by its most conservative member, Justice \n     Antonin Scalia, for allowing police to use traffic stops to \n     obliterate the expectation of privacy the Fourth Amendment \n     bestows.\n\n  This is an admitted liberal editorial writer talking about Brown's \ncourage.\n  This is a lady who is going to do an outstanding job on the DC \nCircuit Court of Appeals. The only tragedy is that she has not been \nthere years earlier. The tragedy is that she has been held up because \nshe looks at doing her job for what it is, which is staying within the \nConstitution and enforcing it, looking at the law and enforcing it; or \nif it goes against what is in the Constitution, ruling it \nunconstitutional, but not looking at the Constitution as she hoped it \nwould be or mixing together a series of ideas in the Constitution and \nfinding a new right; or looking at the law and thinking it should be \nthis way or that and expanding it that way. This is a person who looks \nat her job as being a judge, in an honorable role, but it is a role \nthat has a set to it and a way, and she is upholding that.\n  I believe that is really what is at the cornerstone of this debate. \nUnfortunately, we get it mired so often in personalities and \naccusations and hyperbole, comments of a personal nature toward an \nindividual that are simply not true, when really what we are talking \nabout is the role of courts.\n  Courts, like every institution, are people. People are on the courts. \nWe have judges who are appointed to the courts, and they have their \nviews and they have a way of looking at the Constitution or they have a \nway of looking at various documents or laws. She looks at it as more of \na strict constructionist. That is an honorable way to look at it. I \nbelieve it is the right way to look at it. Yet she gets painted with \nall the other sorts of accusations that are simply not based on fact \nbut are a disguise for what the real debate is about, which is the role \nof the judiciary in America today.\n  We are having a rolling debate about that issue. We are having a lot \nof discussion about that. We are having discussions in various States \nand in the Nation about what is the appropriate role of the judiciary. \nI believe this is a lady who would stand by that role.\n  Those are a series of issues. I may visit some others later on, but \nthis is a lady who is eminently qualified, will do a wonderful job. I \nsupport her nomination, and I hope we can get to a strong vote fairly \nsoon on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is a debate that is worth having. \nThere has been a great deal of discussion about this nominee for the \nlifetime appointment to the Federal bench.\n  There is no entitlement, of course, to a lifetime appointment to the \nFederal bench. The Constitution provides how this is done. First, the \nPresident shall nominate a candidate for a lifetime service on the \nFederal courts, and, second, the Congress shall provide its advice and \nconsent, and determine whether to confirm the nominee. So the President \nnominates, sends a name, and the Congress does what is called in the \nConstitution advise and consent, says yes or no.\n  In most cases, the Congress says yes. This President, President \nGeorge W. Bush, has sent us 218 names of people he wanted to send to \nthe Federal courts for a lifetime. This Congress has said ``yes'' to \n209 of the 218. That is pretty remarkable, when you think about it--209 \nout of 218 we have said ``yes.'' There are a few we have delayed and \nheld up and have been subject to cloture votes. Some have said they \nhaven't gotten a vote. Yes, they have gotten a vote. The procedure on \nthe floor, of course, is there is a cloture vote, and they didn't get \nthe 60 votes, but 60 votes is what requires consensus in the Senate. It \nhas been that way for decades and decades.\n\n  I have voted for the vast, vast majority of the 209 Federal judges \nthat the President has nominated, including, incidentally, both of the \nFederal judgeships in North Dakota which were open. Both of which are \nnow filled with Republicans. I was pleased to support them. I think \nthey are first-rate Federal judges. I am a Democrat. The names that \ncame down from the President to fill the two judgeships in North Dakota \nwere names of Republicans. I am proud of their service. I testified in \nfront of the Judiciary Committee for both of them and introduced both \nof them.\n  So the fact is this is not about partisanship. It is about nominating \ngood people, nominating people in the mainstream of political thought \nhere in this country.\n  I take no joy in opposing a nominee, but I do think that if Members \nof the Senate will think carefully about the views of this nominee, \nthey will decide that she really ought not be put on the second most \nimportant court in this country for a lifetime of service. Let me go \nthrough a few things that this nominee, Janice Rogers Brown, has said.\n  Let me say to my colleague who was speaking when I came in, this is \nnot innuendo, not argumentative; these are quotes from the nominee. \nFacts are stubborn things. We are all entitled to our own opinions, but \nwe are not all entitled to our own set of facts. Let me read the facts, \nand let me read the quotes that come from this nominee.\n  This nominee, Janice Rogers Brown, says that the year 1937 was ``the \ntriumph of our own socialist revolution.'' Why? In 1937, that is when \nthe courts, including the Supreme Court, upheld the constitutionality \nof Social Security and the other major tenets of the New Deal. The \ntriumph of socialism? I don't think so. What planet does that sort of \nthinking come from, a ``triumph of socialism''?\n  This nominee says that zoning laws are a ``theft'' of property, a \ntaking, under the Constitution; therefore, a theft of property. Well, \nwe have zoning laws in this country for a reason. Communities decide to \nestablish zoning laws so you don't build an auto salvage yard next to a \nchurch, and then have somebody move in with a porn shop next to a \nschool and a massage parlor next to a funeral home. But this nominee \nthinks zoning is a theft of property. It is just unbelievable, it is so \nfar outside the mainstream thought.\n  Here is what she says about senior citizens in America.\n\n       Today's senior citizens blithely cannibalize their \n     grandchildren because they have a right to get as much free \n     stuff as the political system will permit them to extract.\n\n  I guess she is talking about maybe Social Security and Medicare. I \ndon't know for sure. All I know is that a good many decades ago, before \nthere was Social Security and Medicare, fully one-half of all elderly \nin this country lived in poverty.\n  Think of that. What a wonderful country this is. This big old planet \nspins around the Sun, we have 6 billion neighbors inhabiting this \nplanet called Earth, and we reside in the United States of America. \nWhat a gift and blessing it is to be here. But think, in 1935, one-half \nof America's elderly, if they were lucky enough to grow old, to age to \nthe point where they were called elderly, one-half of them lived in \npoverty. One-half of them lived in poverty. So this country did \nsomething important, very important. We put together a Social Security \nProgram and a Medicare Program. What did this nominee say about that? \nShe said:\n\n       Today's senior citizens blithely cannibalize their \n     grandchildren because they have a\n\n[[Page S6142]]\n\n     right to get as much free stuff as the political system will \n     permit them to extract.\n\n  Really? I wish perhaps she could have been with me one evening at the \nend of a meeting in a small town of about 300 people. A woman came up \nto me after the meeting and she grabbed a hold of my elbow. She was \nprobably 80 years old. She said: Mr. Senator, can you help me?\n  I said I would try.\n  Then her chin began to quiver and her eyes welled up with tears and \nshe said: I live alone. And she said: My doctor says I have to take \nmedicine for my heart disease and diabetes, and I can't afford it. I \ndon't have the money. Then she began to get tears in her eyes.\n  I wish perhaps Janice Rogers Brown understood something about that. \nShe thinks this old lady, this elderly woman, struggling to find a way \nto pay for medicine to keep her alive, is cannibalizing somebody? I \ndon't think so. I think it is incredible that someone would say this.\n  Now the President wants to put this nominee on the second highest \ncourt in the land for a lifetime of service.\n  She says again:\n\n       We are handing out new rights like lollipops in the \n     dentist's office.\n\n  I guess I never thought the basic rights that we have in this country \nought to be antithetical to what we believe is most important in \nAmerica. I have traveled over most of this world and been in countries \nwhere there aren't rights. I have been in a country where, if people \nhave the wrong piece of paper in their pocket and they are picked up, \nthey are sent to prison for 12 years. I have seen the tyranny of \ndictatorships and the tyranny of communism. I happen to think basic \nrights that exist in this country for the American people are \ncritically important; that ``We the people,'' the first three words of \nthat document that represents the constitutional framework for this \ncountry's governance, is not something that ought to be taken lightly.\n\n  Let me read a couple of other things that this nominee has said. She \nwas the only member of the California Supreme Court to conclude that \nage discrimination victims should not have the right to sue under \ncommon law. Age discrimination victims should not have the right to \nsue?\n  She was the only member of the California Supreme Court who voted to \nstrike down a San Francisco law that provided housing assistance to \ndisplaced and low-income and disabled people.\n  I don't understand the President sending us this nominee. Is it the \ncase that this administration really wants to put on the Federal bench \nfor a lifetime someone who is opposed to the basic tenets of the New \nDeal that have lifted so many people out of poverty in this country, \nthat represents, in many cases, some of the best in this country--\ntelling old folks that when you reach that retirement age you don't \nhave to lay awake at night worrying about whether you are going to be \nable to go to the doctor when you get sick because there will be \nMedicare; or telling people that Social Security will be there when you \nneed it--you work, you invest in it, when you retire, you can collect \nit. Do we really want to put someone on this circuit court who believes \nthat is a triumph of socialism? I don't think so.\n  There is a kind of arrogance here these days that is regrettable. I \nwas here in the 1990s, and I watched 60 Americans who were nominated \nfor judgeships never even have the courtesy of a day of hearings, let \nalone get to the floor of the Senate for a cloture vote or a vote up or \ndown--60 of them. We are not even given the courtesy of a day of \nhearings. The President sends the name down in the 1990s. The majority \nparty said, tough luck, we don't intend to do anything about it; you \nwill not have a hearing; you will not have a vote. This name will not \nadvance.\n\n  We did not do that. This caucus has not done that; in fact, just the \nopposite. Of the 218 names that have been sent to this Congress from \nthis President, the Senate has approved 209 of them. Those who did not \nget confirmed had a cloture vote in the Senate. They had a day of \nhearings. They had an opportunity to testify before the Judiciary \nCommittee. Their name was brought to the floor. We had cloture votes.\n  Now we have Members coming to the Senate on the other side saying, \nlook, our policy is, everyone needs an up-or-down vote; not a cloture \nvote, an up-or-down vote. These Members did not hold that view at all \nin the 1990s. In fact, they did exactly the opposite. There are terms \nfor that which I shall not use here.\n  The fact is, we are proceeding on the Janice Rogers Brown nomination \nbecause of an agreement made 2 weeks ago. I hope, however, having read \nwhat I have read about her views on a wide range of issues, that we \nwill have sufficient colleagues in the Senate to say to this President, \nthis is so far outside the mainstream, we will not approve this \nnominee.\n  It is not unusual for a political party to tell its President that \nyou cannot pack the court. The members of Thomas Jefferson's own \npolitical party told Thomas Jefferson that. Members of the political \nparty of Franklin Delano Roosevelt did the same thing, in his attempt \nto pack the Court.\n  My hope with respect to this nominee is that we will have sufficient \nnumbers on the majority side--moderates and others--who will take a \nlook at this record and say this is not the kind of record that we \nbelieve should commend someone for a lifetime of service on the DC \nCircuit. This is not what we should be doing.\n  I conclude as I started. I take no joy in coming to the Senate and \nopposing someone. I would rather be here speaking for a proposition, \nspeaking for someone. It was Mark Twain who once was asked if he would \nengage in debate. He said, sure, as long as I can take the negative \ntime. He was told, we didn't tell you the subject. He said, the \nnegative side will take no preparation.\n  I am mindful that it is very easy to oppose. Let me say this: On this \nissue, on this nominee, this is not a close call. This is not a close \ncall. I wish I could be here to support this nomination. I will not \nsupport the nomination of someone who believes the elements of that \nwhich has made this country such a wonderful place in which to work and \nlive represents a triumph of socialism. It is not the triumph of \nsocialism. It is a reflection of the interests of this country, we the \npeople of this country who said we will lift the senior citizens of \nthis country out of poverty. And we have done that. We went from 50 \npercent in poverty to less than 10 percent in poverty. Why? Because we \ndid something important in this country, Social Security and Medicare.\n  With respect to environmental issues, with respect to workers' \nrights, with respect to a whole series of issues, this nominee is \nprofoundly wrong. She has a record, a long record, an aggressive record \nof activism in support of what are, in my judgment, outdated and \ndiscredited concepts.\n  My hope is that in the remaining hours in this debate--I think we \nwill vote on this tomorrow--my hope is there will be sufficient \nmoderates on the other side who will understand this record does not \njustify confirmation to the Federal bench for a lifetime. I hope the \nnext time I come to the Senate to speak on a judicial nomination, I \nwill be able to speak in favor of a nomination that is a strong \ncandidate.\n  This President has nominated some good people. I mentioned two from \nmy State. I will say it again: both Republicans, both terrific people, \nboth people I was proud to introduce to the Judiciary Committee and \nproud to support. While we might disagree on some issues, these are \nextraordinary jurists. I am proud they are Federal judges in my State. \nI felt the same way about some of the other nominees.\n  But this President has sent us a handful of nominees who do not \ndeserve the backing and support of this Congress. It is long past the \ntime for this Congress to stand up and speak with an independent voice. \nThis Congress is not some sort of subsidiary of the White House. It is \nnot an adjunct to the Presidency. This Congress is a separate branch of \nGovernment under this Constitution. The President nominates but we \nadvise and consent. It is up to the Senate to determine whether \njudicial nominees are confirmed or not. My hope is we will make the \nright decision with this nomination.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S6143]]\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak for 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Role of the Federal Government\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I know it has been a busy day and we are \nvery much involved, of course, in moving forward with the judge \narrangement, as we should be.\n  I spent a week in my home State. I guess we always come back with \ndifferent ideas. I spent the whole time talking with people and having \ntown meetings and those kinds of things, and in certainly a little \ndifferent atmosphere.\n  People see a great deal in the news media about what is happening \nhere, but, of course, what they get is what the media is intending for \nthem to get, and somehow it is a little bit different. So frankly, \npeople are a little impatient that we are not moving forward as much as \nwe might. Certainly, we are working hard here, but the fact is, we have \nnot moved to many different issues. I believe many of us want to do so.\n  I think we have spent an awful lot of time on internal kinds of \nissues that do not mean a lot to people out in the country. I \nunderstand that. I realize the way things are done here is important to \nus, such as changing procedures and all those things. But folks are \ntalking about energy, folks are interested in a highway bill, people \nare interested in health and the cost of health care, such as what you \ndo in rural areas with health care. There are a lot of these things \nthat are so very important to people on the ground, and here we are \ncontinuing to talk about how we are going to vote on judges. So they \nget a little impatient. I understand that. So I hope we are in the \nprocess of doing something about that.\n  There is also a great deal of concern, of course, in Government \nspending and the deficit. I certainly share that concern. I have been \nmore and more concerned about it as time has gone by. We have Social \nSecurity before us, about which we need to continue to do something.\n  Interestingly enough, the issue that came up most often when I was \nhome in Wyoming is the idea of illegal aliens and illegal immigration \nand the great concern about that. I share that concern. Most people \nhere do. Of course, we are seeking to do something. But perhaps we need \nto focus on some of those issues a little more.\n  I particularly will talk a little bit about spending and about the \ndeficit. I think that is one of our most important issues. In relation \nto that, it seems to me we need to get some sort of an idea of what we \nthink the role of the Federal Government is. We have kind of gotten in \nthe position that for anything that is wanted by anyone, why, let's get \nthe Federal Government to do it. Then we have somebody here on the Hill \nwho will introduce a bill to do that, and perhaps it has very little \nrelationship to what we normally think is the role of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I think most people would agree with the notion we want to limit the \nsize of the Federal Government, that we, in fact, want Government to be \nas close to the people as can be, and that the things that can be done \nat the State level and the county level, the city level, should be done \nthere, the things that can be done in the private sector should be done \nthere. I would hope we could come up with some kind of general idea, an \nevaluation, of what we think the role of the Federal Government \nspecifically should be.\n  The other thing I will comment on a little bit is having some kind of \na system for evaluating programs. We have programs we put into place \nwhen there is a need. Hopefully, there is a need for them. I think it \nis also apparent that over a period of time that need may change. But \nyet, once a program is in place and people are involved, they build a \nconstituency around it. It stays in place without a good look at it to \nsee whether it still belongs there.\n  These are some of the issues of concern. I think the first step \ntoward reducing the $400 billion deficit is eliminating waste. Of \ncourse, what is waste to one person may not be waste to another. But \nthere has to be, again, some definition as to how important things are \nrelative to our goals and to assess programs that stay in place because \nthey are there or that are not managed as well as they might be. I \nthink we have some responsibility to try to ensure that we take a look \nat that issue.\n  There are serious problems facing our Nation today, of course. The \nPresident's budget that he put out proposes eliminating 150 inefficient \nand ineffective Government programs. You can imagine what that is going \nto mean to people who are involved. ``Something in my town? Something \nin my State? We are not going to mess around with that.''\n  There needs to be some kind of a relatively nonpolitical idea as to \nhow you do that and what the purposes are. Of course, I see some of \nthat right now in the military changes that obviously need to be made. \nThey are difficult to make. So I hope the administration will pursue \nthis idea of setting up some kind of a program--and I am here to \nsupport it--that evaluates those programs that are in place to see if, \nindeed, they are still as important as they were in the beginning.\n  We have to even go further than that, of course, to curb runaway \nspending. I think we can consolidate a number of the duplicative \nprograms that are out there and save money and make it more efficient \nin their services. There are organizations that could manage a number \nof programs, each of which now has its own bureaucracy, and to put them \ntogether to make it efficient. I know you will always have people who \nsay: Well, you are taking away jobs. That is not the purpose of \nprograms. The purpose of programs is to deliver a service, and to do it \nin a way that is as efficient as it can be.\n  Of course, there are programs that should be eliminated. They have \naccomplished what they were there for. We need to have a system. I hope \nand I am interested in helping to put together a program that would do \nthat. There is probably some merit in having a termination to a program \nso that after 5 or 10 years, it has to be reevaluated to be extended. \nThat is one way of doing it. I don't know if it is the only way. That \nis something we are going to do, and I would like to do some of that.\n  The role of the Federal Government, again, if you talk in \ngeneralities, if you talk to people in terms of philosophy, most would \nsay, we want to keep the Federal Government small. How many times do \nyou hear people saying: Keep the Federal Government out of my life? Yet \nat the same time we have created this kind of culture where whenever \nanything is needed or wanted, mostly money, then let's get the Federal \nGovernment to do it.\n  If we step back and take a look at it and say: Wait a minute, is this \nthe kind of thing the Federal Government should be involved in or is \nthis something that could be done more efficiently by a government \ncloser to the people, I believe we ought to do that.\n  Some lawmakers here believe the Government is the solution to all of \nsociety's ills. I don't agree with that. I don't believe that. Our role \nin the Federal Government is a limited role. Our role is to provide \nopportunities, not to provide programs for everything.\n  Ronald Reagan said: Government is not the solution to our problem. \nGovernment often is the problem. That is true. That doesn't mean there \nisn't a role. There is a role, an important role. But we need to help \ndefine that somehow. That vision of limited government has, to a large \nextent, been lost. We need to debate. We need to have some discussion, \nsome idea as to what that role is.\n  Unfortunately, sometimes the politics of government are are you going \nto do everything for everybody because it is good politics. Politics is \nnot our only goal here. Our goal is to limit government, to provide \nservices, to provide them efficiently, and to evaluate them as time \ngoes by.\n  Unfortunately, when a program gets put into place, it becomes \ninstitutionalized. It is there often without sufficient change. It is a \nreal challenge. Something we need to do is to develop a plan, a \nconsistent and organized plan to evaluate programs, to determine \nwhether they are outdated, to determine whether they are still \nnecessary, to determine if they could be done in a\n\n[[Page S6144]]\n\nlittle different way to be more efficient and more effective.\n  Clearly the Federal Government does have a role. It has a role in \nmany matters. So our challenge is to determine what the roles are and \nthen to set it up so that we are as efficient as can be. I know I am \ntalking in generalities, but I believe these are some things that are \nbasic to some of the ideas we ought to be talking about and evaluating. \nI sense that doesn't happen very much. We sort of are challenged to see \nhow many programs we can get going. We seem to be challenged to see how \nmuch money we can spend.\n  I appreciate what the administration is seeking to do to try and \nreduce some of the spending. That is very difficult. You can see what \nkind of reaction you get cutting back on programs or changing them. Our \nbudget group is working on doing some of that. We need to be more \ninvolved in that.\n  As I mentioned, evaluating programs is something we should do. We \nhave a constitutional obligation to appropriate hard-earned tax dollars \nin the most efficient manner we possibly can. New government programs \nget institutionalized. They go on forever. So I think there are some \nthings we could do that would be important, and that we should.\n  There will be some proposals coming from OMB. I intend to seek to \nhelp put them into place if we can and have a system that deals with \nefficiency, a system that deals with identifying what the proper role \nof the various levels of government is. We will hear the States saying: \nWe need more money. That is probably true. But nevertheless, we ought \nto have some other definitions besides where the money will go.\n  I hope we have one where we can review some things. I know these are \ngeneral ideas. I have not gotten into the specifics. But from time to \ntime, I think we have to look at ourselves and say: How do we deal with \nsome of these issues? Clearly, everyone would agree we have to do \nsomething about spending. We have to do something about the deficit. We \nhave to look at the future as to how we are going to make this thing \nwork.\n  You can take a look at Social Security. In about 10 years, we will \nhave to take trillions of dollars out of the general fund to put them \nback where they belong in the Social Security fund. That is going to be \nvery difficult. It is a tremendous amount of money. But that is what we \nhave done, of course, and it is reasonable because that money has to be \ndrawing interest and it is drawing interest. But those things are going \nto be more and more difficult.\n  We are seeking to try and review and renew the Tax Code so it can be \nsimpler and more efficient and hopefully provide better opportunities \nfor the economy to grow and have incentives for growing by being able \nto put that money into developing jobs as opposed to coming into the \nFederal Government.\n  These are real challenges, but they are worthwhile: the challenge of \nevaluating government programs to see if they are still important, to \nsee if they are still being done the way they were designed to meet the \nneeds they were designed to meet when they were first there, to do \nsomething about the idea of controlling spending and the size of the \nFederal Government so that doesn't continue to expand into every area \nthat is open. We ought to take a look at all the programs that are in \nplace, that we are talking about putting in place, all the bills that \nare brought in here, and see what a wide breadth of subjects we talk \nabout. Some you could make a pretty good case are not within the area \nof normal recognition of Federal Government activity.\n  I hope the role of the Federal Government is something we could talk \nabout. We ought to talk about it with the State leadership and get a \nlittle clearer idea of how we define these things and get some kind of \na measurement against these roles.\n  There are lots of challenges. I will be happy when we can move on \nthrough this judicial debate. It is very important, but we should not \nbe spending all this much time on it in terms of how we do these things \nand get on with the things that have an impact on what we are doing out \nin the country.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to take up the discussion of \nJustice Janice Rogers Brown and her qualifications for serving on the \nDC Circuit Court of Appeals and some of the accusations and charges \nthat have been brought against her. There have been a number that have \nbeen put forth. I had a lengthy discussion earlier about what I think \nthis is really about, that it is about her being a strict \nconstructionist, wanting to stay within the confines of the \nConstitution and the law and her interpretation rather than an \nexpansive reading of it. I think that is really what is at the root of \nthis, but people bring forth all sorts of allegations and charges, and \nI want to address some of them.\n  One of them is on a particular case, the Lochner case. As it might be \ndescribed, this is getting into the weeds and details of some items, \nbut I think it is meritorious to raise. She has been charged by some of \nour colleagues that in the Santa Monica Beach v. Superior Court case \nthat Justice Brown called the demise of the Lochner decision, which was \noverruled in 1937, the revolution of 1937, and ``she wants to undo'' \nthis overruling. A couple of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle said that Justice Brown believes in Lochner and wants the New \nDeal undone. That is the charge against Janice Rogers Brown. I want to \ntalk about that particular charge because the opposite is what is \nactually true. This is the opposite of what Justice Brown said, and I \nwant to go through her words of what she said to refute that particular \ncase.\n  They are accusing her of wanting to undo the New Deal and the \nlegislation that has been in place surrounding and regarding the New \nDeal.\n  In the Santa Monica case, which is the case that is cited for her \nopinion that she wants to undo the New Deal legislation of Roosevelt--\nFDR--she clearly criticized Lochner as wrongly decided:\n\n       [T]he Lochner court was justly criticized for using the due \n     process clause as though it provided a blank check to alter \n     the meaning of the Constitution as written.\n\n  It was in the very next sentence that Justice Brown mentioned \n``revolution of 1937.'' In context, it is clear that Brown felt the end \nof Lochner was a good thing, that the end of Lochner was a good thing, \nand she says that. Moreover, the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee flatly asked Justice Brown at the hearing--we are at her \nconfirmation hearing--this issue has been put forward. This charge has \nbeen made that you want to undo the New Deal legislation, that you want \nto overturn FDR, and the legacy of FDR. That is what you want to do. \nThe ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee flatly asked \nJustice Brown at her confirmation hearing:\n\n       Do you agree with the holding in Lochner?\n\n  She answered just as directly, ``No.'' This evidence is out there for \nall to see.\n  Why pretend it is not there is what I would say. She says no, she \ndoes not want to undo the New Deal legislation. She said it in sworn \ntestimony at the Senate Judiciary Committee. She says that in her \nopinion in the Santa Monica Beach case. She does not want to overrule \nthe case.\n  Others have attacked Justice Brown's speech to the Federalist Society \nwhen she lamented the demise of the Lochner era, in which the Supreme \nCourt violated property or other economic rights. That is the \nallegation.\n  Justice Brown's speeches illustrate her personal views. To suggest \nthat her critique of the Holmes dissent in Lochner is evidence of how \nshe would rule in a certain case belies the facts. Indeed, Justice \nBrown has taken issue with the Lochner decision, criticizing the \nSupreme Court's ``usurpation of power,'' stating the Lochner court was \njustly criticized for using the due process clause:\n\n      . . . as though it were a blank check to alter the meaning \n     of the Constitution as written.\n\n  That is what she actually said.\n  Discussing the history of the judiciary, which Hamilton stated was to \nbe\n\n[[Page S6145]]\n\nthe branch ``least dangerous to the political rights of the \nConstitution,'' Justice Brown has stated her personal views that judges \ntoo often have strayed from this framework and engaged in judicial \nactivism.\n  That is something we have talked about a lot, about judicial \nactivism. She believes that too often judges have strayed from this \nframework and engaged in judicial activism. It was in this context that \nJustice Brown stated the standards of scrutiny employed by the \njudiciary, which are not enumerated in the Constitution, often are used \nby judicial activists to reach the results they want.\n  Justice Brown's record shows she is committed to following precedent, \neven when she might personally disagree with it. Partisan attack \ngroups, lacking evidence that Brown is unable to follow precedent, have \nindicated their opposition stems from Justice Brown's supposed \nincorporating her personal views into judicial decisionmaking. They \nassert she injected her personal views on property rights into judicial \nopinions, but nothing could be further from the truth.\n  The two cases cited by the attack groups in this context deal with \nthe Takings clause. The groups fail to point out the Supreme Court \nitself expressed the view that Justice Brown herself is now accused of \nadvocating, that property rights were intended to carry the same import \nas other rights in the Constitution.\n  In Dolan v. City of Tigard, the Supreme Court majority wrote:\n\n       We see no reason why the Takings Clause of the Fifth \n     Amendment, as much a part of the Bill of Rights as the First \n     Amendment or Fourth Amendment, should be relegated to the \n     status of a poor relation in these comparable circumstances.\n\n  That is a 1994 case.\n  The reason I point these out is I want people to know the factual \nsetting here, that she does not support an opinion to overrule New Deal \nlegislation.\n  She has been attacked on her judicial qualifications, which I covered \nin an earlier presentation, but I want to also state here clearly and \nfor the record, the ABA recently found Justice Brown qualified and \nconcluded--this is from the ABA, the American Bar Association--that \nJustice Brown:\n\n      . . . meets the Committee's very high standards with respect \n     to integrity, professional competence and judicial \n     temperament and that the Committee believes that the nominee \n     will be able to perform satisfactorily all of the duties and \n     responsibilities required by the high office of a federal \n     judge.\n\n  If we are going to consider outside evaluations of judges, I would \nthink the ABA's assessment that she is fit to serve on the DC Circuit \nis far more relevant than any others that might come forward.\n  I mentioned these to address some of the attacks on her that I think \nare based on her more limited strict constructionist view than on what \nothers are basing their attacks, by trying to piece things together. \nJustice Brown is enormously qualified by her set of personal \nexperiences, public service, good legal mind, good legal temperament, \nsound training and abilities to serve on the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals. She will make an outstanding judge on that court of appeals.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, while I commend my colleagues for the \ncompromise that momentarily spared this body from the so-called nuclear \noption, their agreement did nothing to change the fact that several of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees fall well outside the mainstream and \nthe parameters of what is an acceptable jurist. This nominee in \nparticular, Janice Rogers Brown, has shown a disdain for the rule of \nlaw and precedent and is undeserving of lifetime tenure on the Federal \nbench.\n  The administration's agenda has become evident throughout the course \nof the debate over judicial nominees. The President, the Republican \nleaders, and their supporters have turned our Federal judiciary into \ntheir own personal political battleground. To satisfy the demands of \ntheir most ardent right wing supporters, the Republicans have not \nchosen to appoint capable Federal jurists but rather the political \nactivists willing to contort the law, precedent, and the Constitution \nin order to promote their own conservative political agenda.\n  Our Federal courts have drifted well to the right in the past two or \nthree decades. Today's so-called moderates would have been called \nconservatives in the 1970s. And while I personally think that this \ndrift is not in the best interest of our country, I understand and \naccept that the President is certainly entitled to nominate \nconservatives to the bench. In fact, I have voted for the vast majority \nof this President's judicial nominees despite the fact that they \nmaintain a conservative philosophy and support positions on issues that \nI do not necessarily agree with. I have done so because these nominees \nhave demonstrated a respect for justice and the rule of law.\n  But even accounting for this drift, some of his nominees, such as \nJanice Rogers Brown, are far outside of even today's conservative \nmainstream.\n  Justice Brown is an agenda driven judge who, usually as a lone \ndissenter, shows little respect for the considered policy judgments of \nlegislatures, repeatedly misconstrues precedent and brazenly criticizes \nU.S. Supreme Court rulings. She has a record of routinely voting to \nstrike down property regulations, invalidate worker and consumer \nprotections and restrict civil rights laws.\n  What makes Justice Brown particularly ill suited for a lifetime \nappointment to District of Columbia Court of Appeals is her disdain for \nGovernment. Among other things, she has long advocated for the demise \nof the New Deal. She equates democratic Government with ``slavery,'' \nclaims that the New Deal ``inoculated the federal Constitution with a \nkind of collectivist mentality,'' calls Supreme Court decisions \nupholding the New Deal ``the triumph of our own socialist revolution,'' \naccuses social security recipients of ``blithely cannibaliz[ing] their \ngrandchildren because they have a right to get as much `free' stuff as \nthe political system permits them to extract,'' and advocates returning \nto the widely discredited, early 20th century Lochner era, where the \nSupreme Court regularly invalidated economic regulations, like \nworkplace protections.\n  ``Where government moves in,'' Justice Brown has stated, ``community \nretreats, civil society disintegrates, and our ability to control our \nown destiny atrophies. The result is: families under siege; war in the \nstreets; unapologetic expropriation of property; the precipitous \ndecline of the rule of law; the rapid rise of corruption; the loss of \ncivility and the triumph of deceit. The result is a debased, debauched \nculture which finds moral depravity entertaining and virtue \ncontemptible.'' Justice Brown's contempt for government runs so deep \nthat she urges ``conservative'' judges to invalidate legislation that \nexpands the role of government, saying that it ``inevitably \ntransform[s] . . . democracy . . . into a kleptocracy.''\n  Furthermore, Justice Brown takes issue with one of the basic tenets \nof our entire judicial system--precedent. When she does not like the \nresult established case law dictates, Justice Brown tries single-\nhandedly to change it. In one dissent, she proclaimed, ``(w)e cannot \nsimply cloak ourselves in the doctrine of stare decisis.''\n  These and other comments have prompted her colleagues on the \nCalifornia Supreme Court to criticize her for ``imposing . . . [a] \npersonal theory of political economy on the people of a democratic \nstate.'' Her fellow justices have taken her to task for asserting ``an \nactivist role for the courts.'' They have noted that she ``quarrel[s] . \n. . not with our holding in this case, but with this court's previous \ndecision . . . and, even more fundamentally, with the Legislature \nitself.'' And finally, they contend that Justice Brown's brand of \njudicial activism, if allowed, would ``permit a court . . . to reweigh \nthe policy choices that underlay a legislative or quasi-legislative \nclassification or to reevaluate the efficacy of the legislative \nmeasure.''\n  Justice Brown's nomination makes clear that we have entered an era in \nwhich conservative politicians are seeking to nominate and confirm \njudges who read the Constitution and the law to coincide with the \nRepublican Party's platform. The expectation is that these judicial \nappointees will toe the party line. This politicization of the \njudiciary carries disastrous consequences. Because when our judges are \nviewed as politicians, it diminishes the influence and the respect \nafforded our courts, which is the lifeblood of their efficacy. Our \nindependent judiciary is the most respected\n\n[[Page S6146]]\n\nin the world, and our courts' ability to reach unpopular but just \ndecisions is made possible only because of the deep wells of legitimacy \nthey have dug.\n  I urge my colleagues to take the longer view for the good of the \nAmerican people. Think carefully about what the result to our judiciary \nwill be if we continue to pack our courts with extremists who ignore \njustice and the law. I implore my colleagues to take seriously their \nconstitutional charge of advice and consent and to reject the \nnomination of Janice Rogers Brown.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to President \nBush's nomination of Janice Rogers Brown to be United States Circuit \nCourt Judge to the Court of Appeals for the DC. Circuit.\n  This morning, the Washington Post editorialized against the \nnomination of Justice Brown, writing that she ``is that rare nominee \nfor whom one can draw a direct line between intellectual advocacy of \naggressive judicial behavior and actual conduct as a judge,'' I agree \nwith this respected newspaper's assessment and ask unanimous consent \nthat this editorial be printed in the Record at the end of my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I have several concerns about Justice Brown's ability to \nserve on this important court. On the California Supreme Court, Justice \nBrown has proven to be an activist judge when it suits her political \nagenda. Consistently, and despite precedent to the contrary, Justice \nBrown has ruled on the side of corporations. For example, in a \ncigarette sales case, she ignored relevant law and protected \ncorporations in lieu of protecting minors. In other cases she has \nplaced corporate interests above law that intended to shield consumers \nand women.\n  Justice Brown has also attempted to remove protections for teachers, \nand has been hostile to such New Deal era programs as Social Security. \nShe has called government assistance programs ``[t]he drug of choice \nfor . . . Midwestern farmers, and militant senior citizens.'' These \nviews are out of touch with most Americans and South Dakotans.\n  During today's debate, colleagues argued that because Justice Brown \nhas been reelected by California voters by a 76 percent margin, she \nshould not be considered ``out of the mainstream.'' This argument is \nmisplaced. First, many other judges get reelected at a higher rate. It \nshould also be noted that her retention reelection took place only 1\\1/\n2\\ years into her tenure on the California Supreme Court, at a time \nbefore her extreme views and activist agenda could have been known by \nvoters.\n  Both the American Bar Association and the California Judicial \nCommission have questioned Justice Brown qualifications to serve on the \nbench. The California Judicial Commission specifically noted questions \nabout her deviation from precedent and her ``tendency to interject her \npolitical and philosophical views into her opinions.'' We should note \ntheir concerns and seriously consider them.\n  Justice Brown's views and history of judicial activism is especially \ndangerous in the DC Circuit. She is a nominee who is far outside of the \nmainstream. For these reasons, I stand in opposition of the \nconfirmation and lifelong appointment of Janice Rogers Brown.\n\n                          Reject Justice Brown\n\n                [From the Washington Post, June 7, 2005]\n\n       The Senate filibuster agreement guaranteeing up-or-down \n     votes for most judicial nominees creates a test for \n     conservatives who rail against judicial activism. For \n     decades, conservative politicians have objected to the use of \n     the courts to bring about liberal policy results, arguing \n     that judges should take a restrained view of their role. Now, \n     with Republicans in control of the presidency and the Senate, \n     President Bush has nominated a judge to the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the D.C. Circuit who has been more open about her \n     enthusiasm for judicial adventurism than any nominee of \n     either party in a long time. But Janice Rogers Brown's \n     activism comes from the right, not the left; the rights she \n     would write into the Constitution are economic, not social. \n     Suddenly, all but a few conservatives seem to have lost their \n     qualms about judicial activism. Justice Brown, who serves on \n     the California Supreme Court, will get her vote as early as \n     tomorrow. No senator who votes for her will have standing any \n     longer to complain about legislating from the bench.\n       Justice Brown, in speeches, has openly embraced the \n     ``Lochner'' era of Supreme Court jurisprudence. During this \n     period a century ago, the court struck down worker protection \n     laws that, the justices held, violated a right to free \n     contract they found in the Constitution's due process \n     protections. There exist few areas of greater agreement in \n     the study of constitutional law than the disrepute of the \n     ``Lochner'' era, whose very name--taken from the 1905 case of \n     Lochner v. New York--has become a code word for judicial \n     overreaching. Justice Brown, however, has dismissed the famed \n     dissent in Lochner by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, saying \n     it ``annoyed her'' and was ``simply wrong.'' And she has \n     celebrated the possibility of a revival of ``what might be \n     called Lochnerism-lite'' using a different provision of the \n     Constitution--the prohibition against governmental \n     ``takings'' of private property without just compensation.\n       In the context of her nomination, Justice Brown has \n     trivialized such statements as merely attempts to be \n     provocative. But she has not just given provocative speeches; \n     ``Lochnerism-lite'' is a fairly good shorthand for her work \n     on the bench, where she has sought to use the takings \n     doctrine aggressively. She began one dissent, in a case \n     challenging regulation of a hotel, by noting that ``private \n     property, already an endangered species in California, is now \n     entirely extinct in San Francisco.'' Her colleagues on the \n     California Supreme Court certainly got what she was up to. In \n     response, they quoted Justice Holmes's Lochner dissent and \n     noted that ``nothing in the law of takings would justify an \n     appointed judiciary in imposing [any] personal theory of \n     political economy on the people of a democratic state.''\n       Justice Brown is that rare nominee for whom one can draw a \n     direct line between intellectual advocacy of aggressive \n     judicial behavior and actual conduct as a judge. Time was \n     when conservatives were wary of judges who openly yearned for \n     courts, as Justice Brown puts it, ``audacious enough to \n     invoke higher law''--instead of, say, the laws the people's \n     elected representatives see fit to pass. That Justice Brown \n     will now get a vote means that each senator must take a stand \n     on whether some forms of judicial activism are more \n     acceptable than others.\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander).

Mr. President, throughout this Congress, I have argued that \nthe Senate ought to spend less time debating radical judges and more \ntime focusing on issues that can improve the lives of working \nAmericans. One such issue is the gradual erosion of retirement \nsecurity. Instead of working to replace Social Security's guaranteed \nbenefit with a risky privatization scheme, we should work to strengthen \nretirement by shoring up our pension system. In no industry is this \nlooming pension crisis more acute than the airline industry. The \nFinance Committee held a hearing on pension problems facing the airline \nindustry this morning, and I hope that the committee will move soon on \nlegislation to fix those problems.\n  Last month we learned just how worrisome this issue is, as the \nPension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and United Airlines agreed to \nterminate the four pension plans maintained by the airline as that \ncompany struggles to emerge from bankruptcy. At the same time, \nNorthwest, Delta and American Airlines face similar pension liabilities \nand are requesting Congress' help so that they can avoid bankruptcy. To \ntheir credit they are fighting to preserve their workers' pensions but \nneed some time to allow them to recover from the effects of the post-9/\n11 travel downturn.\n  While the pension funding problems facing the airline industry are \nsubstantial, the industry is not alone in inadequately funding their \nemployee pension plans. Congress needs to carefully review the rules \nthat apply to the broad spectrum of employers that offer pension plans \nto their employees. Congress needs to make sure that those rules are \nstrengthened to require greater funding for the pension promises\n\n[[Page S6147]]\n\nbeing made. Let me be very clear about one thing; the pension promises \nmade by companies to their employees carry with them an obligation to \nmake sure those promises are kept. An employer's obligation is to have \nsufficient funds set aside to meet the pension promises it has made, \nnot merely to have met the minimum funding requirements of the tax code \nor ERISA.\n  As Congress strengthens the pension funding rules, we also need to be \ncognizant of the potential negative consequences of these changes. \nPension plans, like all employee benefits, are voluntarily offered by \nemployers. Congress created tax and other incentives that encourage \ncompanies to offer pension plans because it believes these are \nimportant benefits for employees.

Mr. President, I understand that the senior Senator from \nOregon, Mr. Wyden, spoke yesterday regarding the reauthorization of the \nUSA PATRIOT Act. I look forward to the Senate acting later this year on \nPATRIOT Act reauthorization, but today I just want to address one \naspect of the Senator's speech, his opposition to administrative \nsubpoena power.\n  In his speech, the Senator argued that any reauthorization should not \nextend those subpoena powers to FBI terrorism investigators. He \ncorrectly noted that Intelligence Committee Chairman Roberts has held \nhearings about extending this authority, which is common within the \nGovernment, to FBI agents investigating terrorism. I was happy to see \nChairman Roberts do this because last year I cosponsored S. 2555, the \nJudicially Enforceable Terrorism Subpoenas Act. On June 22, 2004, I \nchaired a hearing in the Judiciary Subcommittee on Terrorism, \nTechnology, and Homeland Security that examined this subpoena power and \nheard testimony regarding how the subpoenas work and how the government \nprotects civil liberties when using them.\n  One of the things that struck me as I learned about administrative \nsubpoena power was how widespread it is in our Government and how \nunremarkable a law enforcement tool it really is. It was for that \nreason that I asked the Senate Republican Policy Committee, which I \nchair, to examine this issue in greater detail, to study the \nconstitutional and civil liberties questions that critics have raised, \nand to identify the other contexts where the Federal Government has \nthis power. The resulting report was consistent with my previous \nresearch and the testimony that I had heard during my subcommittee \nhearings. We give this subpoena power to postal investigators and Small \nBusiness Administration bank loan auditors and IRS agents, and we do \nnot have a problem with Government abuse or deprivation of civil \nliberties. Shouldn't we also give it to those who are charged with \nrooting out terrorism before it strikes our neighborhoods?\n  I look forward to the upcoming debate on PATRIOT Act reauthorization, \nand I certainly intend to support it. At the same time, I commend \nChairman Roberts for his efforts and hope that we will have the \nopportunity to ensure that our FBI terrorism investigators are not \nhamstrung as they continue to work to protect our Nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this policy paper, dated September 9, \n2004, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Should Postal Inspectors Have More Power Than Federal Terrorism \n                             Investigators?\n\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       Congress is undermining federal terrorism investigations by \n     failing to provide terrorism investigators the tools that are \n     commonly available to others who enforce the law. In \n     particular, in the three years after September 11th, Congress \n     has not updated the law to provide terrorism investigators \n     with administrative subpoena authority. Such authority is a \n     perfectly constitutional and efficient means to gather \n     information about terrorist suspects and their activities \n     from third parties without necessarily alerting the suspects \n     to the investigation. Congress has granted this authority to \n     government investigators in hundreds of other contexts, few \n     of which are as compelling or life-threatening as the war on \n     terror. These include investigations relating to everything \n     from tax or Medicare fraud to labor-law violations to Small \n     Business Administration inquiries into financial crimes. \n     Indeed, Congress has even granted administrative subpoena \n     authority to postal inspectors, but not to terrorism \n     investigators.\n       This deficiency in the law must be corrected immediately. \n     Postal inspectors and bank loan auditors should not have \n     stronger tools to investigate the criminal acts in their \n     jurisdictions than do those who investigate terrorist acts. \n     The Senate can remedy this deficiency by passing legislation \n     like the Judicially Enforceable Terrorism Subpoenas (JETS) \n     Act, S. 2555. The JETS Act would update the law so that the \n     FBI has the authority to issue administrative subpoenas to \n     investigate possible terrorist cells before they attack the \n     innocent. The Act would ensure more efficient and speedy \n     investigations, while also guaranteeing that criminal \n     suspects will have the same civil liberties protections that \n     they do under current law.\n\n\n       Terrorism Investigators' Subpoena Authority is Too Limited\n\n       Federal investigators routinely need third-party \n     information when attempting to unravel a criminal enterprise. \n     In the context of a terrorism investigation, that information \n     could include: financial transaction records that show the \n     flow of terrorist financing; telephone records that could \n     identify other terrorist conspirators; or retail sales \n     receipts or credit card statements that could help \n     investigators uncover the plot at hand and capture the \n     suspects. When third parties holding that information decline \n     to cooperate, some form of subpoena demanding the information \n     be conveyed must be issued. The Supreme Court unanimously has \n     approved the use of subpoenas to gather information, \n     recognizing that they are necessary and wholly constitutional \n     tools in law enforcement investigations that do not offend \n     any protected civil liberties. [See unanimous decision \n     written by Justice Thurgood Marshall in SEC v. Jerry T. \n     O'Brien, Inc., 467 U.S. 735 (1984).]\n       There are different kinds of subpoenas, however, and under \n     current law, the only way that a terrorism investigator \n     (typically, the FBI) can obtain that third-party information \n     is through a ``grand jury subpoena.'' If a grand jury has \n     been convened, investigators can usually obtain a grand jury \n     subpoena and get the information they need, but that process \n     takes time and is dependent on a number of factors. First, \n     investigators themselves cannot issue grand jury subpoenas; \n     instead, they must involve an assistant U.S. Attorney so that \n     he or she can issue the subpoena. This process can be \n     cumbersome, however, because assistant U.S. Attorneys are \n     burdened with their prosecutorial caseloads and are not \n     always immediately available when the investigators need the \n     subpoena. Second, a grand jury subpoena is limited by the \n     schedule of a grand jury itself, because the grand jury must \n     be ``sitting'' on the day that the subpoena demands that the \n     items or documents be returned. Grand juries do not sit at \n     all times; indeed, in smaller jurisdictions, the only \n     impaneled grand jury may meet as little as ``one to five \n     consecutive days per month.'' [See United States Dept of \n     Justice, Federal Grand Jury Practice, at Sec. 1.6 (2000 ed.). \n     For example, in Madison, Wisc., the federal grand jury only \n     meets a few days every three weeks. See Clerk of the Court \n     for the Western District of Wisconsin, ``Grand Jury \n     Service,'' revised April 15, 2004.]\n       The following hypothetical illustrates the deficiency of \n     current law. Take the fact that Timothy McVeigh built the \n     bomb that destroyed the Oklahoma City Federal Building while \n     he was in Kansas; and take the fact that under current \n     practices, grand juries often are not sitting for 10-day \n     stretches in that state. If FBI agents had been tracking \n     McVeigh at that time and wanted information from non-\n     cooperative third parties--perhaps the supplier of materials \n     used in the bomb--those agents would have been unable to move \n     quickly if forced to rely on grand jury subpoenas. McVeigh \n     could have continued his bomb-building activities, and the \n     FBI would have been powerless to gather that third-party \n     information until the grand jury returned--as many as 10 days \n     later. [Information on Kansas federal grand jury schedules \n     provided to Senate Republican Policy Committee by Department \n     of Justice. In addition, Department of Justice officials have \n     testified to another scenario: even where grand juries meet \n     more often (such as in New York City), an investigator \n     realizing she urgently needs third-party information on \n     Friday afternoon still could not get that information until \n     Monday, because the grand jury would have gone home for the \n     weekend. See Testimony of Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney \n     General Rachel Brand before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee \n     on Terrorism, Technology and Homeland Security on June 22, \n     2004.]\n       The current dependence on the availability of an assistant \n     U.S. Attorney and the schedule of a grand jury means that if \n     time is of the essence--as is often the case in terrorism\n\n[[Page S6148]]\n\n     investigations--federal investigators, lacking the necessary \n     authority, could see a trail turn cold.\n\n\n       The Better Alternative: Administrative Subpoena Authority\n\n       The deficiency of grand jury subpoenas described above can \n     be remedied if Congress provides ``administrative subpoena'' \n     authority for specific terrorism-related contexts. Congress \n     has authorized administrative subpoenas in no fewer than 335 \n     different areas of federal law, as discussed below. [See U.S. \n     Department of Justice, Office of Legal Policy, Report to \n     Congress on the Use of Administrative Subpoena Authorities by \n     Executive Branch Agencies and Entities, May 13, 2002, at \n     p. 5 (hereinafter ``DOJ Report'').] Where administrative \n     subpoena authority already exists, government officials \n     can make an independent determination that the records are \n     needed to aid a pending investigation and then issue and \n     serve the third party with the subpoena. This authority \n     allows the federal investigator to obtain information \n     quickly without being forced to conform to the timing of \n     grand jury sittings and without requiring the help of an \n     assistant U.S. Attorney. And, as simply another type of \n     subpoena, the Supreme Court has made clear that it is \n     wholly constitutional. [See Jerry T. O'Brien, 467 U.S. at \n     747-50.]\n       The advantages of updating this authority are substantial. \n     The most important advantage is speed: terrorism \n     investigations can be fast-moving, and terrorist suspects are \n     trained to move quickly when the FBI is on their trail. The \n     FBI needs the ability to request third-party information and \n     obtain it immediately, not when a grand jury convenes. \n     Moreover, this subpoena power will help with third-party \n     compliance. As Assistant Attorney General Christopher Wray \n     stated in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, \n     ``Granting [the] FBI the use of [administrative subpoena \n     authority] would speed those terrorism investigations in \n     which subpoena recipients are not inclined to contest the \n     subpoena in court and are willing to comply. Avoiding delays \n     in these situations would allow agents to track and disrupt \n     terrorist activity more effectively.'' [Assistant Attorney \n     General Christopher Wray, in testimony before the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee, October 21, 2003.] Thus, Congress will \n     provide protection for a legitimate business owner who is \n     more than willing to comply with law enforcement, but who \n     would prefer to do so pursuant to a subpoena rather than \n     through an informal FBI request.\n\n\n                       Constitutional Protections\n\n       It is important to note that nothing in the administrative \n     subpoena process offends constitutionally protected civil \n     liberties, as has been repeatedly recognized by the federal \n     courts.\n       First, the government cannot seek an administrative \n     subpoena unless the authorized federal investigator has found \n     the information relevant to an ongoing investigation. [See S. \n     2555, Sec. 2(a) (proposed 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2332g(a)(1)). The \n     Attorney General has the authority to delegate this power to \n     subordinates within the Department of Justice. See 28 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 510.] The executive branch--whether Republican or \n     Democrat--carefully monitors its agents to ensure that civil \n     liberties are being protected and that authorities are not \n     being abused. [See, for example, Executive Order Establishing \n     the President's Board on Safeguarding Americans' Civil \n     Liberties (August 27, 2004), detailing extensive interagency \n     oversight of civil liberties protections for Americans.]\n       Second, the administrative subpoena is not self-enforcing. \n     There is no fine or penalty to the recipient if he refuses to \n     comply. Thus, if the recipient of an administrative subpoena \n     believes that the documents or items should not be turned \n     over, he can file a petition in federal court to quash the \n     subpoena, or he can simply refuse to comply with the subpoena \n     and force the government to seek a court order enforcing the \n     subpoena. And, as one federal court has emphasized, the \n     district court's ``role is not that of a mere rubber stamp.'' \n     [Wearly v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 616 F.2d 662, 665 (3rd Cir. \n     1980).] Just as a grand jury subpoena cannot be unreasonable \n     or oppressive in scope [Federal Grand Jury Practice, at \n     Sec. 5.40], an administrative subpoena must not overreach by \n     asking for irrelevant or otherwise-protected information.\n       The Supreme Court has addressed the standards for enforcing \n     administrative subpoenas.\n       In United States v. Powell, the Supreme Court held that an \n     administrative subpoena will be enforced where (1) the \n     investigation is ``conducted pursuant to a legitimate \n     purpose,'' (2) the subpoenaed information ``may be relevant \n     to that purpose,'' (3) the information sought is not already \n     in the government's possession, and (4) the requesting \n     agency's internal procedures have been followed. [379 U.S. \n     48, 57-58 (1964); see also EEOC v. Shell Oil, 466 U.S. 54, 73 \n     n.26 (1984) (citing Powell in EEOC context and adding that \n     the request for information cannot be ``too indefinite'' or \n     made for an ``illegitimate purpose''); Jerry T. O'Brien, 467 \n     U.S. at 747-48 (reaffirming Powell in context of SEC \n     administrative subpoena).] In addition, the Supreme Court has \n     stated that the recipient may challenge the subpoena on ``any \n     appropriate ground'' [Reisman v. Caplin, 375 U.S. 440, 449 \n     (1964)]. which could include a privilege against self-\n     incrimination, religious freedom, freedom of association, \n     attorney-client privilege, or other grounds for resisting \n     subpoenas in the grand jury context. [See cases collected in \n     Graham Hughes, Administrative Subpoenas and the Grand Jury: \n     Converging Streams of Civil and Compulsory Process, 47 Vand. \n     L. Rev. 573, 589 (1994), cited in DOJ Report, at p. 9 n.19.] \n     This ``bifurcation of power, on the one hand of the agency to \n     issue subpoenas and on the other hand of the courts to \n     enforce them, is an inherent protection against abuse of \n     subpoena power.'' [United States v. Security Bank and Trust, \n     473 F.2d 638, 641 (5th Cir. 1973).]\n       Third, where the authorized agent has not specifically \n     ordered the administrative subpoena recipient not to disclose \n     the existence of the subpoena to a third party, the recipient \n     can notify the relevant individual and that individual may \n     have the right to block enforcement of the subpoena himself. \n     [In Jerry T. O'Brien, the Supreme Court noted that a ``target \n     may seek permissive intervention in an enforcement action \n     brought by the [Securities & Exchange] Commission against the \n     subpoena recipient'' or may seek to restrain enforcement of \n     the administrative subpoena. 467 U.S. at 748.] In many cases \n     the ``target'' (as opposed to the recipient) will have full \n     knowledge of the subpoena.\n       However, this is not always the case; sometimes the \n     administrative subpoena authority includes a provision \n     prohibiting the recipient from discussing the subpoena with \n     anyone other than his or her attorney. Some critics have \n     argued that federal investigators should not be able to \n     gather information related to an individual without notifying \n     that individual, and that every person has an inherent right \n     to know about those investigations. [See generally Jerry T. \n     O'Brien, 467 U.S. at 749-50 (rejecting demand that SEC must \n     notify any potential defendant of existence of pending \n     administrative subpoena).] But, as the Supreme Court has \n     held, there is no constitutional requirement that the subject \n     of an investigation receive notice that the administrative \n     subpoena has been served on a third party. Justice Thurgood \n     Marshall wrote for a unanimous Court that a blanket rule \n     requiring notification to all individuals would set an unwise \n     standard. [Id. at 749-51. The issue in that case was the \n     nondisclosure provisions of the administrative subpoena \n     authority used by the SEC when investigating securities \n     fraud.] He explained that investigators use administrative \n     subpoenas to investigate suspicious activities without any \n     prior government knowledge of who the wrongdoers are, so \n     requiring notice often would be impossible. [Id. at 749.] \n     Moreover, granting notice to individuals being investigated \n     would ``have the effect of laying bare the state of the \n     [government's] knowledge and intentions midway through \n     investigations'' and would ``significantly hamper'' law \n     enforcement. [Id. at 750 n.23.] Providing notice to the \n     potential target would ``enable an unscrupulous target to \n     destroy or alter documents, intimidate witnesses,'' or \n     otherwise obstruct the investigation. [Id. at 750.] The Court \n     further emphasized that where ``speed in locating and \n     halting violations of the law is so important,'' it would \n     be foolhardy to provide notice of the government's \n     administrative subpoenas. [Id. at 751.]\n\n\n    most government agencies have administrative subpoena authority\n\n       Given these extensive constitutional protections, it is \n     unsurprising that Congress has extended administrative \n     subpoena authority so widely. Current provisions of federal \n     law grant this authority to most government departments and \n     agencies. [DOJ Report, at p. 5. See appendices A-C to DOJ \n     Report that describe and provide the legal authorization for \n     each of these administrative subpoena powers.] These \n     authorities are not restricted to high-profile agencies \n     conducting life-or-death investigations. To the contrary, \n     Congress has granted administrative subpoena authority in far \n     less important contexts. For example, 18 US.C. Sec. 3061 \n     authorizes postal inspectors to issue administrative \n     subpoenas when investigating any ``criminal matters related \n     to the Postal Service and the mails.'' One can hardly contend \n     that federal investigators should be able to issue \n     administrative subpoenas to investigate Mohammed Atta if they \n     suspect he broke into a mailbox but should not have the same \n     authority if they suspect he is plotting to fly airplanes \n     into buildings.\n       It is not just postal inspectors who have more powerful \n     investigative tools than terrorism investigators. Congress \n     has granted administrative subpoena authorities for a wide \n     variety of other criminal investigations. A partial list \n     follows:\n       Small Business Administration investigations of criminal \n     activities under the Small Business Investment Act, such as \n     embezzlement and fraud. [Congress granted administrative \n     subpoena authority to the Small Business Administration \n     through section 310 of the Small Business Investment Act of \n     1958. Delegation to investigators and other officials is \n     authorized by 15 U.S.C. Sec. 634(b). Relevant criminal \n     provisions also include the offer of loan or gratuity to bank \n     examiner (18 U.S.C. Sec. 212), acceptance of a loan or \n     gratuity by bank examiner (18 U.S.C. Sec. 213), and receipt \n     of commissions or gifts for procuring loans (18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 215).]\n       Internal Revenue Service investigations of such crimes as \n     tax evasion.

Sec. 634(b). Relevant criminal provisions also \n     include the offer of loan or gratuity to bank examiner (18 \n     U.S.C.

Sec. 215).]\n       The Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement \n     investigations of violations of immigration law. [See 8 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1225(d)(4) (granting administrative subpoena \n     power to ``any immigration officer'' seeking to enforce the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Act).]\n       Federal Communications Commission investigations of \n     criminal activities, including obscene, harassing, and \n     wrongful use of telecommunications facilities.

[See 50 App. U.S.C. Sec. 2411 (granting \n     administrative subpoena authority for criminal \n     investigations).]\n       Corporation of Foreign Security Holders investigations of \n     criminal activities relating to securities laws. [See 15 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 77t(b) (granting administrative subpoena \n     authority in pursuit of criminal investigations).]\n       Department of Justice investigations into health care fraud \n     [See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3486(a)(1)(A)(i)(I) (granting \n     administrative subpoena authority).] and any offense \n     involving the sexual exploitation or abuse of children. [See \n     18 U.S.C. Sec. 3486(a) (granting administrative subpoena \n     authority).]\n       Moreover, Congress has authorized the use of administrative \n     subpoenas in a great number of purely civil and regulatory \n     contexts--where the stakes to the public are even lower than \n     in the criminal contexts above. Those include enforcement in \n     major regulatory areas such as securities and antitrust, but \n     also enforcement for laws such as the Farm Credit Act, the \n     Shore Protection Act, the Land Remote Sensing Policy Act, and \n     the Federal Credit Union Act. [DOJ Report, App. A1 & A2.]\n       Nor are these authorities dormant. The Department of \n     Justice reports, for example, that federal investigators in \n     2001 issued more than 2,100 administrative subpoenas in \n     connection with investigations to combat health care fraud, \n     arid more than 1,800 administrative subpoenas in child \n     exploitation investigations. [DOJ Report, at p. 41.] These \n     authorities are common and pervasive in government--just not \n     where it arguably counts most, in terrorism investigations.\n\n\n       s. 2555 would update the administrative subpoena authority\n\n       S. 2555, the Judicially Enforceable Terrorism Subpoenas Act \n     of 2004 (the ``JETS Act''), would enable terrorism \n     investigators to subpoena documents and records in any \n     investigation concerning a federal crime of terrorism--\n     whether before or after an incident. As is customary with \n     administrative subpoena authorities, the recipient of a \n     JET subpoena could petition a federal district court to \n     modify or quash the subpoena. Conversely, if the JET \n     subpoena recipient simply refused to comply, the \n     Department of Justice would have to petition a federal \n     district court to enforce the subpoena. In each case, \n     civil liberties would be respected, just as they are in \n     the typical administrative subpoena process discussed \n     above.\n       The JETS Act also would allow the Department of Justice to \n     temporarily bar the recipient of an administrative subpoena \n     from disclosing to anyone other than his lawyer that he has \n     received it, therefore protecting the integrity of the \n     investigation. However, the bill imposes certain safeguards \n     on this non-disclosure provision: disclosure would be \n     prohibited only if the Attorney General certifies that \n     ``there may result a danger to the national security of the \n     United States'' if any other person were told of the \n     subpoena's existence. [S. 2555, Sec. 2(a) (proposed 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2332g(c)).] Moreover, the JET subpoena recipient would \n     have the right to go to court to challenge the nondisclosure \n     order, and the Act would protect the recipient from any civil \n     liability that might otherwise result from his good-faith \n     compliance with such a subpoena.\n       Given the protections for civil liberties built into the \n     authority and its widespread availability in other contexts, \n     there is little excuse for failing to extend it to the FBI \n     agents who are tracking down terrorists among us.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       Congress is hamstringing law enforcement in the war on \n     terror in failing to provide a proven tool--administrative \n     subpoena authority--for immediate use for the common good. \n     Federal investigators should have the same tools available to \n     fight terrorism as do investigators of mail theft, Small \n     Business Administration loan fraud, income-tax evasion, and \n     employee-pension violations. S. 2555 provides a means to \n     update the law and accomplish that worthy goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/07/senate-section/article/S6149-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              40TH ANNIVERSARY OF GRISWOLD V. CONNECTICUT\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 40th \nanniversary of the Supreme Court's crucial decision in Griswold v. \nConnecticut.\n  Forty years ago, Estelle Griswold and Dr. Lee Buxton were arrested \nand convicted for counseling married couples on birth control methods, \nand prescribing married couples contraceptives. They challenged their \nconvictions, and the Supreme Court overturned them, ruling that the \nConnecticut law under which they were charged was unconstitutional. The \nCourt found that the Government had no place in interfering in the \nintimately private marital bedroom. Justice William O. Douglas, in \nwriting the Court's opinion, scoffed at the notion of police searching \nprivate bedrooms for evidence of contraceptive use. This landmark \ndecision, cited in countless numbers of decisions since then on the \nconstitutional right to privacy, guarantees the right of married \ncouples to use birth control.\n  Yet the relevance of this decision goes far beyond contraceptive use. \nIn rendering its decision, the Court recognized a ``zone of privacy'' \narising from several constitutional guarantees. The Court acknowledged \nthat while the right of privacy is not enumerated specifically in \nanyone place, it is inherent in several areas within the Bill of Rights \nand throughout the Constitution. This very American notion of privacy \nserved as a cornerstone of precedent, paving the way for other \ndecisions and further solidifying as established law the constitutional \nright to privacy. Roe v. Wade, guaranteeing a woman's right to choose, \nwas a logical application of Griswold.\n  Today, Americans' privacy rights are threatened on many fronts. The \nGovernment is asserting greater and greater investigative powers. Some \npharmacists are refusing to fill prescriptions for legal \ncontraceptives. The anniversary of Griswold gives us all an opportunity \nto reflect on the importance of preserving our privacy rights. The \nCourt recognized that we are born with privacy rights as Americans, and \nwe have a particular responsibility as Senators to protect these rights \nfor our constituents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/07/senate-section/article/S6149-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6149-S6152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MORT CAPLIN ON THE NATION'S TAX SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, earlier this year, Mort Caplin, a \nfounding partner of the law firm Caplin & Drysdale in Washington, DC, \nand the outstanding IRS Commissioner under President Kennedy, delivered \nthe Erwin Griswold Lecture at the annual meeting of the American \nCollege of Tax Counsel, which was held in San Diego.\n  In his eloquent and very readable address, Mr. Caplin summarizes the \nevolution of our modern tax system, the current challenges it faces, \nthe recent efforts by Congress to achieve reform, the alarming drop in \ncompliance and revenue collection, and the ethical responsibilities of \nthe tax bar.\n  Mr. Caplin's remarks are especially timely today as Congress \nstruggles to deal with its own responsibility for the effectiveness, \nintegrity and fairness of our tax laws. All of us in the Senate and \nHouse can benefit from his wise words, and I ask unanimous consent that \nhis lecture be printed at this point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Virginia Tax Review, Spring 2005]\n\n     The Tax Lawyer's Role in the Way the American Tax System Works\n\n                        (By Mortimer M. Caplin)\n\n       It is a high privilege to be asked to deliver this Erwin N. \n     Griswold Lecture and a treat too to see so many old friends \n     and meet so many new ones. In honor of our namesake, I would \n     like to touch on four matters of relevance: (1) Dean \n     Griswold's impact on the tax law, (2) the role of the U.S. \n     Tax Court, (3) the role of the IRS, and (4) the tax lawyer's \n     role in the way the American tax system works.\n\n[[Page S6150]]\n\n       My first contact with the Dean was in my early days as a \n     young law professor at the University of Virginia School of \n     Law--struggling in the classroom using Griswold, Cases and \n     Materials on Federal Taxation. Not that the casebook was \n     entirely new to me; for, with the good help of the G.I. bill, \n     I'd become well-acquainted with it at N.Y.U. in my post-World \n     War II doctoral efforts. It's hard to believe, but the \n     Griswold casebook was the first ever devoted entirely to \n     federal income taxation; and it proved a godsend to me as I \n     segued from New York law practice to teaching at UVA in the \n     fall of 1950.\n       Erwin Griswold and I met at law professor gatherings and \n     bar meetings, especially in the early 1950's at American Law \n     Institute sessions in Washington as members of ALI's Tax \n     Advisory Group. We both were hard at work on its \n     comprehensive tax report, which later became part of the 1954 \n     Code. Never did I tell him though that, in using his \n     casebook, my custom was to try a personal touch by \n     distributing mimeograph materials that totally rearranged the \n     order of presentation and reading assignments. Nor did I ever \n     hint that, after a year or two, I switched entirely to his \n     major competitor, the more comprehensive Surrey and Warren. \n     He probably learned about it faster than I thought skimming \n     through his royalty reports--reports which he undoubtedly \n     scrutinized with great care.\n       He had graduated from Harvard Law School in 1929, and his \n     first real contact with the tax law was during his five-year \n     stint as a fledgling attorney in the Office of the Solicitor \n     General of the United States. Federal tax rates and tax \n     receipts were at a low point then and handling tax cases was \n     not the most sought after assignment. By default, he soon \n     became the office's tax expert, arguing the bulk of its tax \n     cases both in the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Courts of \n     Appeals. I should mention that, just before leaving the \n     S.G.'s office, he was instrumental in the rule change that \n     allowed appeals in tax cases to be made under the general \n     title ``Commissioner of Internal Revenue,'' without the need \n     to specify the name of the incumbent. That's why you see \n     older tax cases bearing the names of particular \n     Commissioners--David Burnet or Guy T. Helvering, for \n     example--and, later, hardly any with names like Latham, \n     Caplin, Cohen, Thrower and the like. Let me mournfully add: \n     ``Sic transit gloria mundi''--so passes away the glory of \n     this world!\n       Erwin Griswold left the S.G.'s office in 1934 to become a \n     Harvard Law School professor for 12 years, and then dean for \n     the next 21. He had a major influence on tens of thousands of \n     law students as well as lawyers throughout the world. As \n     years went by, he reminisced that he found ``less \n     exhilaration'' in teaching the federal tax course as ``the \n     tax law had become far more technical and complicated . . . \n     In the early days, the statute was less than one hundred \n     pages long and the income tax regulations . . . were in a \n     single, rather slight, volume.'' Oh, for the good old days!\n       In the fall of 1967, he returned to the S.G.'s office, but \n     this time as the Solicitor General of the United States--a \n     position he held for six years. He'd been appointed by \n     President Lyndon B. Johnson during the last years of his \n     administration, and in 1969 was reappointed by President \n     Richard M. Nixon. President Nixon for his second term, \n     however, preferred as his S.G. a Yale law professor, Robert \n     H. Bork, someone more closely in tune with his philosophy. \n     Erwin Griswold's duties ended in June 1973, at the close of \n     the Supreme Court's term, well in time to avoid the heavy \n     lifting of Watergate and the ``Saturday Night Massacre.'' \n     Although, he later said that he would not have followed \n     Solicitor General Bork in carrying out the President's order \n     to fire Special Watergate Prosecutor Archibald Cox.\n       Shortly after leaving office, he joined Jones, Day, Reavis \n     & Pogue as a partner and engaged in law practice and bar \n     activities for some 20 years, until his death in 1994 at the \n     age of 90. Erwin Griswold was honored many times over, not \n     only for his innumerable contributions to the law, but for \n     ``his moral courage and intellectual energy . . . meeting the \n     social responsibilities of the profession.''\n       I always suspected that any special feeling the Dean may \n     have had for me had roots in my strong backing of his plea \n     for a single federal court of tax appeals--to resolve \n     conflicts and provide ``speedier final resolution of tax \n     issues.'' He observed, ``The Supreme Court hates tax cases, \n     and there is often no practical way to resolve such \n     conflicts''; and he anguished over the practicing bar's \n     opposition to his proposal, convinced that ``the real reason \n     is that tax lawyers find it advantageous to have uncertainty \n     and delay''--a preference for forum-shopping, if you will. \n     But in the end, in his 1992 biography, Ould Fields, New \n     Corne, he sounded a bit more hopeful: ``Eventually, something \n     along the lines proposed will have to come as it makes no \n     sense to have tax cases decided by thirteen different courts \n     of appeals, with no effective guidance on most questions from \n     the Supreme Court.''\n       One Supreme Court Justice, who'd had hands-on experience in \n     tax administration, and well understood weaknesses in our \n     appellate review system, was former Justice Robert H. \n     Jackson. The Court's most informed member on taxation, he had \n     previously served successively as ``General Counsel'' of the \n     Bureau of Internal Revenue (succeeding E. Barrett Prettyman), \n     Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Tax Division, \n     Solicitor General, and then Attorney General of the United \n     States. In 1943, in his famous Dobson opinion, Justice \n     Jackson made a determined effort to strengthen the Tax \n     Court's status in the decision-making process so as to \n     minimize conflicts and attain a greater degree of uniformity. \n     To these ends, he laid down a stringent standard in appellate \n     review of Tax Court decisions:''\n       [W]hen the [appellate] court cannot separate the elements \n     of a decision so as to identify a clear-cut mistake of law, \n     the decision of the Tax Court must stand . . . While its \n     decisions may not be binding precedents for courts dealing \n     with similar problems, uniform administration would be \n     promoted by conforming to them where possible.''\n       The message was straightforward and seemingly clear; but it \n     didn't cover District Court decisions or those of the Court \n     of Federal Claims. Also, other problems were encountered by \n     judges and members of the bar, and dissatisfaction was high. \n     Ultimately this led to the 1948 statutory reversal of \n     Dobson by enactment of the review standard now in the \n     Internal Revenue Code, which requires U.S. Courts of \n     Appeals to review Tax Court decisions ``in the same manner \n     and to the same extent as decisions of the district courts \n     in civil actions tried without a jury.'' And that's where \n     the situation lies today--save for those still aspiring, \n     as Erwin Griswold did for the rest of his life, for \n     greater uniformity and earlier resolution of conflicts.\n       Justice Jackson never did change his view about the \n     critical importance of the Tax Court. In his 1952 dissent in \n     Arrowsmith v. Commissioner, he underscored this in strikingly \n     poignant fashion, saying: ``In spite of the gelding of Dobson \n     v. Commissioner . . . by the recent revision of the Judicial \n     Code . . . I still think the Tax Court is a more competent \n     and steady influence toward a systematic body of tax law than \n     our sporadic omnipotence in a field beset with invisible \n     boomerangs.''\n       Members of the tax bar readily endorse this strong vote of \n     confidence in the role of the Tax Court. As our nationwide \n     tax tribunal for over 80 years, it has served effectively and \n     with distinction as our most important court of original \n     jurisdiction in tax cases.\n       Today's tax system has its genesis in World War II when \n     income taxes rapidly expanded from a tax touching the better \n     off only, to a mass tax reaching out to the workers of \n     America. Revenue collection was turned upside down with \n     Beardsley Ruml's ``pay-as-you-go,'' collection-at-the-source, \n     withholding and estimated quarterly payments, and floods of \n     paper filings. Commissioner Guy Helvering said it couldn't be \n     done. And, in fact, the old Bureau of Internal Revenue, with \n     its politically-appointed Collectors of Internal Revenue, was \n     not fully up to the task. Subcommittee hearings chaired by \n     Congressman Cecil R. King, D-California, revealed \n     incompetence, political influence and corruption; and \n     directly led to a total overhaul under President Harry \n     Truman's 1952 Presidential Reorganization Plan. New district \n     offices and intermediate regional offices, replaced the old \n     Collectors' offices; and, except for the Commissioner and \n     Chief Counsel, who still require presidential nomination and \n     Senate confirmation, the entire staff was put under civil \n     service. The last step a year later was the official name \n     change to ``Internal Revenue Service.''\n       The new IRS made remarkable headway turning itself \n     completely around by the end of the 1950's; and it was not \n     long before it was recognized as one of government's leading \n     agencies. In the early 1960's, new heights were reached \n     through a fortunate confluence of events, strong White House \n     endorsement and unflagging budgetary support. President John \n     F. Kennedy had a special interest in tax law and tax \n     administration and almost immediately called on Congress for \n     anti-abuse tax legislation and strengthening of tax law \n     enforcement, including Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy's \n     drive against organized crime. Of key importance was the \n     final congressional go-ahead for installing a nationwide \n     automatic data processing system (ADP), backed by approval of \n     individual account numbers and a master file of taxpayers \n     housed in a central national computer center. IRS had entered \n     the modern age. But it is this same ADP design, now badly \n     out-of-date, which is still in use, albeit patched with \n     additions and alterations. And it is the dire need to \n     modernize this 44-year old system which is IRS' chief \n     challenge today.\n       Starting in the 1970's, IRS began to encounter its present \n     serious difficulties. A series of complex legislative \n     changes, tightened budgets, an exploding workload, and \n     expensive failures to complete its ``tax systems \n     modernization'' (TSM) project-- all contributed to weakened \n     performance and heightened congressional oversight. In 1995 \n     and 1996, Congress created the National Commission \n     on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service ``to review \n     the present practices of the IRS, and recommend how to \n     modernize and improve the efficiency and productivity of \n     the IRS while improving taxpayer services.'' A year later, \n     the Commission issued its report, ``A Vision for a New \n     IRS,'' which led to the enactment of the Internal Revenue \n     Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 (RRA 98).\n       The report centered chiefly on governance and managerial \n     type changes, including IRS modernization, a publicly-\n     controlled Oversight Board, a business-type Commissioner of \n     Internal Revenue, electronic filing and a paperless tax \n     system, taxpayer rights, and finally--and of primary \n     importance--changing\n\n[[Page S6151]]\n\n     IRS' culture and mission so as to place emphasis on enhanced \n     ``customer service'' and functioning like ``a first rate \n     financial institution.'' Congress was asked to do its part \n     too: simplified tax legislation; complexity analyses reports; \n     multiyear budgeting; joint hearings and coordinated reports \n     of the different oversight committees. To the more \n     sophisticated, the suggestions to Congress appeared more \n     aspirational than realistic.\n       The House largely followed the Commission's recommendations \n     (H.R. 2676). But the legislation found itself pending at a \n     tumultuous time, when the air was filled with words of U.S. \n     Senators--if you can believe it--like: ``end the IRS as we \n     know it,'' ``tear the IRS out by the roots,'' ``drive a stake \n     in the heart of the corrupt culture at the IRS,'' and ``stop \n     a war on taxpayers.'' At this point, Senator William V. Roth, \n     Jr., R-Delaware, Senate Finance Committee Chairman, took over \n     and ran a series of dramatic, highly televised hearings, \n     carefully prepared by his staff, and featuring a handful of \n     allegedly abused taxpayers and IRS employees who gave \n     testimony that shocked the nation. Never at the time did the \n     IRS have the opportunity to tell its side of the story; nor \n     was the testimony tested for accuracy or placed in proper \n     context. Later, however, after enactment of RRA 98, court \n     proceedings and various government reports by the GAO and \n     Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) \n     clearly established that much of the testimony was not only \n     misleading but false; IRS may have made mistakes, but they \n     were not malicious or systemic. Numerous corrective news \n     stories began to appear with sharp headlines like the \n     following: ``IRS Abuse Charges Discredited''; ``Highly \n     Publicized Horror Story That Led to Curbs on IRS Quietly \n     Unravels''; ``IRS Watchdog Finds Complaints Unfounded''; \n     ``Court is Asked to Block False Complaints against IRS''; \n     ``Secret GAO Report is Latest to Discredit Roth's IRS \n     Hearings.'' But publication came too late; the damage was \n     already done.\n       Congress, the public and ultimately the Clinton \n     administration had all been outraged by the Senate testimony \n     and, almost overnight, sweeping support was given to Senator \n     Roth's proposed highly stringent treatment of the IRS. His \n     Senate version added some 100 new provisions to the House \n     bill. Some are praiseworthy and reasonably protective of \n     taxpayer rights, but others step over the line, unduly \n     micromanaging IRS daily operations and laying the groundwork \n     for serious delaying tactics by taxpayers and damage to the \n     administrative process. In the end, the legislation was \n     adopted by an overwhelming vote. One of the most criticized \n     provisions is the ``10 Deadly Sins'' sanction in section 1203 \n     of RRA 98. This peremptory discharge procedure, which directs \n     the Commissioner to terminate an employee for any one of \n     certain specified violations, is deeply disturbing to IRS \n     personnel. Some hesitate to enforce the tax law because of \n     possible unfair exposure to complaints by disgruntled \n     taxpayers. Both Commissioner Mark W. Everson and former \n     Commissioner Charles O. Rossotti have noted this erratic \n     impact and have requested modification. In my mind, there is \n     little doubt that section 1203 should be totally repealed.\n       Commissioner Rossotti very ably captained the transition to \n     the new culture. But with Congress' continuing emphasis on \n     the ``customer service'' aspect of tax administration, it was \n     not until his last years that the word ``enforcement'' began \n     to trickle out, along with warnings of the ``continuing \n     deterioration'' and ``dangerous downtrend in the tax \n     system.'' This shift in emphasis was quickly hastened by new \n     Commissioner Mark Everson, who early announced: ``At the \n     IRS our working equation is service plus enforcement \n     equals compliance.'' (This to me is the basic ``S-E-C of \n     taxation.'') He underscores repeatedly the significant \n     ``diminution of resources''; the continuing fall in \n     audits, collection, notices to non-filers; the 36 percent \n     drop in enforcement personnel since 1996; and, since 1998, \n     the audit rate drop of 57 percent!\n       Perhaps of even greater importance is the negative impact \n     this weakened enforcement has had on compliance and self-\n     assessment. Commissioner Everson often quotes President \n     Kennedy's admonition: ``Large continued avoidance of tax on \n     the part of some has a steadily demoralizing effect on the \n     compliance of others.'' Indeed, the annual tax gap continues \n     to grow: Last reported as a $311 billion tax loss each year--\n     from underreporting, nonpayment and non-filing--new findings \n     of a major increase are anticipated in the IRS study now \n     underway\n       With repeated annual deficits and a burgeoning national \n     debt, the Commissioner recently confessed: ``The IRS, frankly \n     speaking, needs to bring in more money to the Treasury.'' The \n     White House had confirmed this by supporting a 2005 budget \n     increase and allocating to enforcement alone an increase of \n     11 percent. But this was not to be. For in the cut-back in \n     the increase, House majority leader Tom DeLay, R-Texas, \n     commented rather imprudently: ``I don't shed any tears for \n     the IRS. Our priority as far as the IRS is concerned is to \n     put them out of business.'' So much for the looming crisis in \n     meeting the revenue needs of our democracy!\n       IRS' final 2005 appropriation reflected hardly a one \n     percent increase--an overall grant of $10.3 billion, almost \n     $400 million below the President's request. This tight \n     squeeze tells clearly why IRS went along with outsourcing to \n     private debt-collection agencies the collection of certain \n     delinquent tax accounts. The statutory authorization to pay \n     outsiders up to 25 percent of tax debts collected is \n     technically ``off-book''; and through this backdoor \n     financing, IRS' appropriations takes no direct hit.\n       This then is the very serious state of affairs confronting \n     those directly concerned with the fair and balanced \n     administration of our tax law.\n       The proper functioning of our tax system is largely \n     dependent upon the quality and responsible involvement of \n     well-trained tax practitioners, primarily tax lawyers and tax \n     accountants. Well over half the public seeks their help for \n     tax advice and return preparation--inquiring, time and again, \n     about the ``rules of the road,'' what's right and what's \n     wrong, what's lawful and what's not. The integrity and \n     standards of these tax professionals serve as the nation's \n     guideposts, with direct impact on taxpayer compliance and the \n     self-assessment concept itself. The significance of their \n     good faith practices cannot be overstated.\n       Recent congressional and IRS investigations, however, have \n     identified an alarming spread of extremely questionable \n     practices, some approaching outright fraud, by a number of \n     previously well-regarded tax practitioners. The Senate \n     Finance Committee has zeroed in directly on practitioners as \n     a whole, emphasizing the ``important role tax advisors play \n     in our tax system.'' Chairman Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, \n     caustically observed: ``At the heart of every abusive tax \n     shelter is a tax lawyer or accountant.'' In full agreement, \n     Senator Max Baucus, D-Montana, the committee's ranking \n     minority member, added: ``Let's stop these unsavory practices \n     in their tracks by restoring integrity and professionalism in \n     the practitioner community.'' In their follow-up letter to \n     the Treasury Secretary John N. Snow, they called for \n     reinvigoration of IRS' Office of Professional Responsibility \n     (OPR), for its proper funding, and for extension of the \n     authority of its new head, Cono Namorato. Much has \n     happened since, legislatively and administratively.\n       Taking the lead, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 \n     greatly enhances OPR's effectiveness through a series of new \n     provisions that expand Circular 230's reach: (1) confirming \n     authority to impose standards on tax-shelter opinion writers, \n     (2) clarifying authority to ``censure'' practitioners, as \n     well as to suspend or disbar them, (3) granting authority, \n     for the first time, to impose monetary penalties on \n     individual practitioners, as well as on employers or entities \n     for which they act, and (4) granting injunction authority, \n     for the first time, to prevent recurrence of Circular 230 \n     violations.\n       In turn, publication of Treasury's long-awaited Circular \n     230 amendments on tax-shelter opinion writing puts OPR's \n     momentum in high gear. The official release advises that \n     these ``final regulations provide best practices for all tax \n     advisors, mandatory requirements for written advice that \n     presents a greater potential for concern, and minimum \n     standards for other advice.'' No doubt is left, however, that \n     the amendments' underlying intent is to ``Promote Ethical \n     Practice,'' ``improve ethical standards,'' and ``restore and \n     maintain public confidence in tax professionals.'' \n     Highlighted too is the caution that ``one of the IRS' top \n     four enforcement goals'' is ``[e]nsuring that attorneys, \n     accountants and other tax practitioners adhere to \n     professional standards and follow the law.''\n       This is a harsh estimate of tax practitioners in general. \n     As members of the profession of tax lawyers, it is difficult \n     to ignore our collective responsibility to respond. What do \n     we do about it? Certainly the tax bar has not been asleep. \n     Both the ABA Tax Section and the AICPA separately have been \n     working on standards of practice for over 40 years; and each \n     has published a series of guiding principles which continue \n     as works in progress. The issue remains, however, whether the \n     tax bar has probed deeply enough.\n       Have we been willing to grapple with more subtle, more \n     difficult issues? Have we articulated what we regard as \n     ``best practices'' for tax lawyers, keeping in mind that \n     Circular 230 applies to a broad range of ``practitioners''? \n     Tax lawyers are clearly quite distinguishable from other \n     ``practitioners'' and, indeed, from lawyers in general. And \n     it seems fair to ask: Which practices are acceptable to the \n     tax bar, and which are not? At what point does the tax bar \n     regard tax advice or tax practice as crossing the line? As \n     ``too aggressive''? As ``things that are not done''?\n       These questions, of course, transcend the current concern \n     with tax shelters only. It may not be long, in my view, \n     before we will be asked to revisit a broader question: \n     ``Whether, in a system that requires each taxpayer to self-\n     assess the taxes that are legally due, a tax lawyer can \n     properly advise a client that he or she may take an \n     undisclosed tax return position absent the lawyer's good \n     faith belief that the position is `more likely than not' \n     correct?'' In considering the issue some 20 years ago, ABA \n     Formal Opinion 85-352 crafted as a more flexible answer the \n     ``realistic possibility of success'' test, which later became \n     a touchstone used by Congress and the Treasury in assessing \n     certain penalties. In light of unacceptable developments \n     since then, it would seem timely for the entire subject \n     matter to undergo a thorough review.\n       In his speech on The Public Influence of the Bar, Supreme \n     Court Chief Justice Harlan F. Stone addressed the same theme \n     of lawyers' ethics in relation to the great Wall\n\n[[Page S6152]]\n\n     Street stock market crash. Critical of ``clever legal \n     devices,'' and critical of lawyers having done ``relatively \n     so little to remedy the evils of the investment market,'' he \n     observed that ``whatever standards of conduct in the \n     performance of its function the Bar consciously adopts must \n     at once be reflected in the character of the world of \n     business and finance.'' In his view, ``the possibilities of \n     its influence are almost beyond calculation''; and he went on \n     to advise, ``It is needful that we look beyond the club of \n     the policeman as a civilizing agency to the sanctions of \n     professional standards which condemn the doing of what the \n     law has not yet forbidden.''\n       The point is: Though we are a long-recognized profession, \n     allowed the privilege of autonomy and essentially self-\n     regulation, no insurmountable barriers exist to prevent \n     encroachment on this privilege, or even its end, if our \n     practices or standards are regarded as inadequate or \n     unrealistic. Today, we already see a gradual erosion flowing \n     from a series of new governmental rules--by Congress, for \n     example through the Internal Revenue Code or legislation like \n     Sarbanes-Oxley, or by the SEC or Public Company Accounting \n     Oversight Board (``Peekaboo''), or by Treasury through \n     Circular 230 or other regulations.\n       Our profession of tax lawyers must take the initiative and \n     become more intently involved--more proactive and not simply \n     defensive. Problems need be identified and solutions \n     developed by ourselves, and where necessary recommended for \n     implementation by the bar in general or by appropriate \n     governmental bodies. We cannot wait for others to compel \n     answers. Nor can we move at the pace of the ALI project that \n     required 13 years to complete a two-volume Restatement of the \n     Law Governing Lawyers. Ours would naturally be more immediate \n     in time and focus, and might well look to the leadership of \n     the ABA Section on Taxation, this organization, the American \n     College of Tax Counsel, or some other concerned and qualified \n     group.\n       As tax lawyers, we face many different responsibilities \n     daily--to our clients, to the profession, to the public, to \n     ourselves. How we maintain our own self-respect as lawyers; \n     how we desire to be viewed by others; and how we use our \n     special skills to improve the nation's revenue raising \n     system--are all questions crossing our minds every day, some \n     at times in conflict and in need of balancing as we confront \n     different tasks. In this regard, Dean Griswold counseled us \n     to preserve our ``independence of view''--separating our \n     representation of clients from our role as public citizens \n     seeking to improve the functioning of government.\n       The one exemplar he acclaimed is Randolph E. Paul, \n     Treasury's General Counsel and tax policy leader during World \n     War II, whom the Dean refers to as ``one of the early giants \n     in the tax field.'' Randolph, with whom I practiced during my \n     beginning days as a lawyer, asserted this individual \n     independence throughout his entire career, while he developed \n     a remarkable tax practice. In the closing lines of his \n     classic Taxation in the United States, he makes these seminal \n     observations on ``the responsibilities of tax experts'':\n       ``The most I can say is that I do not think surrender needs \n     to be unconditional . . . I know tax advisers who accomplish \n     the double job of ably representing their clients and \n     faithfully working for the tax system taxpayers deserve . . . \n     At another level I venture the opinion that they lead a more \n     comfortable life than do many of their colleagues. Of one \n     thing I am very sure--that both taxpayers and the government \n     need many more of these independent advisers.''\n       Tonight this room is filled with many of these independent, \n     responsible advisers--some surely to become the giants we \n     will salute in the future. I am certain that together we will \n     overcome our present challenge ``to restore and maintain \n     public confidence in tax professionals.'' At the same time, I \n     have no doubt too that we will not fail in our ongoing \n     commitment to better the way in which our nation's needs for \n     revenue are fulfilled, fairly and honorably.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/07/senate-section/article/S6152-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n         RETIREMENT OF 10 UTICA COMMUNITY SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize \n10 individuals in Michigan for their dedication and service to public \neducation. The Utica Community School District can be proud of these \nmen and women for their devotion to improving the lives of countless \nyoung people.\n  The Utica Community School District encompasses Utica, most of \nSterling Heights, Shelby Township and parts of Ray, Washington, and \nMacomb Townships. It is the second largest school district in Michigan, \nwith a current enrollment of over 29,000 students. Utica takes pride in \nits educational standards, dedication, and service to its students. \nThese goals would not have been possible without the efforts of the \nfollowing 10 school administrators who have a combined 300-plus years \nof service and have collectively touched the lives of more than 500,000 \nchildren over the course of their careers. The accomplishments and the \nimpacts on public education these individuals have had over the years \nare numerous and impressive.\n  Each of these individuals has played a vital role in building strong \nrelationships with students, parents, teachers, and the community at \nlarge in this diverse and vibrant region of southeast Michigan. They \nexemplify the necessary dedication, determination, and professionalism \nto foster individualized attention to each student. I am pleased to \nhonor each of them:\n  David A. Berube, Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources; Vivian \nV. Constand, Director of Elementary Education; Joseph F. Jeannette, \nAssistant Director of Elementary Education; Susan E. Meyer, Director of \nSecondary Education; Glenn A. Patterson, Director of Human Resources; \nDiane M. Robinson, Supervisor of Employee Benefits; Nancy M. Searing, \nAssistant Director of Secondary Education; Linda M. Theut, \nAdministrative Assistant to the Superintendent, Judith M. Wagner, \nSupervisor of Special Education; and John S. Zoellner, Director of \nFiscal Services.\n  On July 1, 2005, these individuals will retire from their respective \ncareers in education, and their leadership and talents will surely be \nmissed. I know my Senate colleagues join me in congratulating these 10 \ndistinguished individuals for their many efforts throughout the years, \nand to recognize their record of service to the Utica community schools \nand to the surrounding community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/07/senate-section/article/S6152-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       TRIBUTE TO GEORGE DEMENT, MAYOR OF BOSSIER CITY, LOUISIANA\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize George \nDement, mayor of Bossier City, LA. Mayor Dement will retire from office \non June 30, 2005, after 16 years of service to northwest Louisiana. \nMayor Dement is retiring from public service on the same date he was \ninaugurated 16 years earlier. Today, I take a moment to offer warm \nthanks for his years of service to Bossier City and best wishes for his \ncoming commendation ceremonies.\n  A native of Princeton, LA, Mayor Dement served in the U.S. Submarine \nService in both the Atlantic and Pacific Theaters during WorId War II \nand was present when the Japanese surrendered at Tokyo Bay. After 5 \nyears of military service, he attended Centenary College and Louisiana \nState University Shreveport. Upon completing his studies, Mayor Dement \nbegan a 22-year tenure with Holiday Inn and was named Innkeeper of the \nYear in 1976. In 1989, he was elected mayor of Bossier City where he \nhas been reelected three times--all with large margins of victory.\n  As mayor, Mr. Dement will be remembered for his leadership and \naccessibility. During his tenure, Mayor Dement led the way on four \ndifferent phases of the Arthur Ray Teague Parkway and also poured large \namounts of energy into revitalizing key areas of Bossier City.\n  Fondly referred to as ``the people's mayor,'' Mr. Dement is known for \nhis honesty and commonsense approach to governing. I come to the Senate \nfloor today to join the residents of Bossier City in personally \ncommending, honoring, and thanking him for his 16 years of service to \nnorthwest Louisiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/07/senate-section/article/S6152-3", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6152-S6153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESCUE AND RESTORE PROGRAM\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to mark the occasion of \nthe 500th nonprofit and faith-based group joining Rescue & Restore \nVictims of Human Trafficking, an initiative by the U.S. Department of \nHealth and Human Services. Rescue & Restore is a project to help \nprotect the victims of trafficking in human beings.\n  After years of working on a bipartisan level with colleagues to pass \nthe Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, it is my distinct \npleasure to commemorate this landmark achievement. Rescue & Restore is \na multicity, decentralized national coalition to find, identify and \nrescue victims of human trafficking in the United States and restore \nthem to a condition of human dignity. The program does this through the \nengagement of thousands of individuals and hundreds of government and \ncommunity organizations. TVPA\n\n[[Page S6153]]\n\nwas designed to protect the victims of involuntary servitude, sexual \nexploitation, forced labor and other forms of a contemporary slave \ntrade.\n  Since the launch of the first Rescue & Restore city coalition in \n2004, the rate of trafficking victims rescued has more than doubled \nover the previous reporting period--from 107 victims receiving \ncertification letters, to 224. More victims are being identified every \nday. There are now more than 10,000 ``boots on the ground'' in 14 \ncities and trained advocates actively seeking out trafficking victims.\n  Today, June 7, a statewide Rescue & Restore coalition is set to be \nlaunched in Illinois in cooperation with the administration of Governor \nRod Blagojevich. The Chicago rollout is a true watershed in the mission \nto locate, identify, rescue, and restore trafficking victims to a \ncondition of human dignity. This is a statewide endeavor, the first of \nits kind, involving the full panoply of Illinois state and local \ngovernment law enforcement and health and human welfare agencies \nworking in a coalition with more than 60 nongovernmental and social \nwelfare organizations, child advocates, and health care professionals \nmobilized to combat trafficking. Other coalition launches are planned \nfor Long Island NY, Houston, and Los Angeles later this year for a \ntotal of 17 geographical regions to be served.\n  Human trafficking is the fastest growing criminal industry in the \nworld today, affecting as many as 900,000 victims worldwide. The CIA \nestimates that as many as 17,500 men, women and children are brought \ninto the U.S. annually by force, fraud or coercion as victims of human \ntrafficking. Others are victimized right here in America, trafficked \ninto prostitution or forced labor. Many of the victims are women or \nchildren who are forced into prostitution; others are pressed into \nlabor slavery such as sweatshops, peonage, or domestic servitude.\n  Rescue & Restore coalition partners are using their existing channels \nof communication and growing public awareness to help Americans \nrecognize the existence of human trafficking. They are educating their \nassociates and constituents on how to identify and assist trafficking \nvictims. We now have taken vital steps toward wiping the scourge of \nhuman trafficking from our shores.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/07/senate-section/article/S6153-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-2452.

A bill to amend the National Labor Relations Act to ensure \nthe right of employees to a secret-ballot election conducted by the \nNational Labor Relations Board; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, today I introduce the Secret Ballot \nProtection Act, a measure that would amend the National Labor Relations \nAct, NLRA, to ensure the right of employees to a secret ballot election \nconducted by the National Labor Relations Board, NLRB, when deciding \nwhether to be represented by a labor organization.\n  The legislation would prohibit a union from being recognized based on \na ``card check'' campaign. Under a card check system, a union gathers \nauthorization cards purportedly signed by workers expressing their \ndesire for the union to represent them. By their very nature, card \nchecks strip employees of the right to choose freely, safely, and \nanonymously, whether to unionize and leave them open to harassment, \nintimidation, and union pressure.\n  The bill also addresses the increasing pressure faced by employers \nfrom union bosses to recognize unions based on a card check campaign \nand forego the customary secret ballot election supervised by the \nNational Labor Relations Board, NLRB, which gives workers the ability \nto vote their conscience without fear of reprisal.\n  Under current law, employers may voluntarily recognize unions based \non these card checks, but are not required to do so. However, threats, \nboycotts, and other forms of public pressure are increasingly being \nused to force employers to recognize unions based on a card-check \nrather than the customary secret ballot election. The need for \nlegislation to protect workers' rights could not be more clear.\n  It is no secret that hostile campaigns against American businesses to \ndiscredit employers have become a key organizing tactic used by union \nbosses across the country. These and other pressure tactics are often \ndesigned to hurt employers, their workers, and the economy, unless the \ndemands of union leaders are met. It is wrong that union bosses are \nusing these types of tactics at the expense of secret ballot elections, \ndepriving rank-and-file workers of the ability to freely vote their \nconscience without fear of retaliation.\n  The Secret Ballot Protection Act will preserve the integrity of \nworkers' freedom of choice and the right to a secret ballot election; \nit will protect workers from fear, threats, misinformation, and \ncoercion by a union or coworkers to sign union authorization cards; and \nit will eliminate a union's ability to coercively terrorize an employer \ninto recognition under duress. These fundamental protections can be \nachieved by simply requiring unions to win a majority of worker support \nin an anonymous, secret ballot election which eliminates the shroud of \nunion intimidation tactics.\n  Supporting the right to a private vote and outlawing the corrupt card \ncheck practice of allowing union thugs to bully, harass, and scare \nworkers who object to union membership is absolutely critical to \ndemocracy and freedom of choice.\n  Secret ballots are an absolutely essential ingredient for any \nfunctioning democratic system. The lack of secret ballot elections is \nhow oppressive regimes manage to stay in power without majority \nsupport. Repelling such oppression hinges on the ability to walk into a \nvoting booth, pull the curtain, and vote for anyone or anything we \nplease with confidence the vote will be counted but never revealed to \nanyone who could use the knowledge to retaliate.\n  Evidence clearly demonstrates that secret ballot elections are more \naccurate indicators than card checks of whether employees actually wish \nto be recognized by a union. Numerous court decisions echo this fact. \nFor example, in the case NLRB v. S.S. Logan Packing Co., the court \nsaid:\n\n       It would be difficult to imagine a more unreliable method \n     of ascertaining the real wishes of employees than a card \n     check, unless it were an employer's request for an open show \n     of hands. The one is no more reliable than the other.\n\n  There is no question that card checks leave employees open to \nharassment, intimidation, and union pressure. Workers' democratic \nrights should be protected, and the Secret Ballot Protection Act will \nmake sure that happens by preserving the secret ballot election \nprocess. This important measure would guarantee workers the right to an \nanonymous, secret ballot election conducted by the NLRB and eliminate \nthe use of intimidation and threats by organizers to coerce workers \ninto joining a union.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S6157]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1173\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The right of employees under the National Labor \n     Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.) to choose whether to be \n     represented by a labor organization by way of secret ballot \n     election conducted by the National Labor Relations Board is \n     among the most important protections afforded under Federal \n     labor law.\n       (2) The right of employees to choose by secret ballot is \n     the only method that ensures a choice free of coercion, \n     intimidation, irregularity, or illegality.\n       (3) The recognition of a labor organization by using a \n     private agreement, rather than a secret ballot election \n     overseen by the National Labor Relations Board, threatens the \n     freedom of employees to choose whether to be represented by a \n     labor organization, and severely limits the ability of the \n     National Labor Relations Board to ensure the protection of \n     workers.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to improve the provision of health care and services \nto veterans in Hawaii, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Neighbor \nIslands Veterans Health Care Improvements Act.'' My State of Hawaii is \nhome to 115,000 veterans, nearly 18,000 of whom avail themselves of VA \nhealth care. Unfortunately, the level of care provided to those living \non Oahu and the Neighbor Islands--Kauai, Molokai, Lanai, Maui, and the \nBig Island--is not at the optimal level. My legislation would \nsignificantly improve the level of care the veterans residing in Hawaii \nhave so bravely earned.\n  Hawaii is undoubtedly an exceptional place to make one's home, and \nits population continues to grow each year. As such, the number of \nveterans seeking VA health care has grown. However, the level of \nservices provided to Hawaii's veterans has failed to keep pace. \nAdditionally, each day more veterans are returning home to Hawaii from \nthe Global War on Terror, including Operations Enduring and Iraqi \nFreedom. It is critical that these brave men and women receive adequate \ncare. It is equally critical that today's veterans receive needed long-\nterm care and mental health care.\n  My bill would ensure that care and facilities are optimized, that the \nburden of VA personnel is diminished, and that veterans throughout the \nstate receive specialized care. Specifically, my legislation calls for \nnew Community Based Outpatient Clinics and Vet Centers in areas that \ndesperately need additional health care facilities, as well as \nexpanding services at those already in existence. Satellite clinics \nproviding both medical care and mental health counseling would be \nopened on the islands of Molokai and Lanai, which currently lack VA \nfacilities. Staff levels at existing clinics and Vet Centers would be \nincreased to compensate for these new clinics and to provide needed \ncommunity-based long-term care, such as home care. My legislation also \nauthorizes the construction of a $10 million mental health center on \nthe grounds of Tripler Army Medical Center, which will include an \ninpatient Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder residential treatment program.\n  That our veterans receive the long-term care to which they are \nentitled is of major concern to me. In fact, the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, of which I am Ranking Member, held a hearing on the potential \ndemand for long-term care just this May. I would like to point out that \nthe VA Center for Aging in Honolulu--the only VA nursing home in the \nState--has a mere 60 beds. This is nowhere near sufficient to care for \nthe number of veterans who reside there. Furthermore, community nursing \nhome beds are limited. Given the dearth of nursing home beds, both VA \nand community, the Neighbor Islands Veterans Health Care Improvements \nAct authorizes a medical care foster program on the Island of Oahu. \nModeled on the successful Medical Care Foster Program at the Central \nArkansas Veterans Health Care System, such a system places veterans in \na permanent foster home, allowing them to remain in the community while \nreceiving the care they need.\n  Because I believe specialized care, such as orthopedics and \nopthamology, are limited on the neighbor islands, the bill directs that \nVA fully study the provision of such care. VA would then be required to \nmake a formal determination as to the adequacy of specialized care. I \nmay seek to direct improvements in this area at a later date.\n  This bill is vital to those veterans residing in Hawaii. Though they \nmay live far from the other veterans on the mainland, they are just as \nentitled to quality health care.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n  (The bill will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 1177. A bill to improve mental health services at all facilities \nof the Department of Veterans Affairs; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise proudly today to introduce \nlegislation that would enhance the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) \nability to provide mental health and other specialized services to its \npatients. At a time when our Nation is at war, it is imperative that we \nensure that all veterans have access to top quality mental health care, \nwhether they visit a VA hospital or clinic.\n  At the time of its creation, the VA health care system was tasked \nwith meeting the special needs of its veteran patients. Those veterans \nwho suffered from spinal cord injuries, amputations, blindness, Post-\nTraumatic Stress Disorder, substance abuse, and homelessness required \nunique forms of treatment and rehabilitation. During the past few \ndecades, VA has emerged as the industry leader in providing specialized \nservices to these types of patients. Much of VA's expertise in these \nareas remains unparalleled in the larger health care community--\nparticularly with regard to mental health care.\n  However, it is with great dismay that I rise today, as VA's \nspecialized programs are in jeopardy due to budget constraints. \nIncreased demand and flatline budget increases over the past\n\n[[Page S6158]]\n\nfew years have literally starved the system. Sadly, this problem is not \na new one. Back in 1996, Congress recognized the merits of these \nspecialized programs and that they could be vulnerable to cuts because \nof their smaller scale. As such, we enacted legislation that required \nVA to retain its capacity to provide specialized services at the levels \nin place at the time of the bill's passage in 1996, and to annually \nreport as to the status of its compliance with this requirement.\n  Despite this effort by Congress and the actions of my predecessors on \nthis Committee to subsequently strengthen the original legislation to \nprotect VA's specialized services, VA continues to underfund and cut \nback resources for these vital programs. Additionally, VA has employed \nmeasures such as counting dollars according to 1996 levels to appear as \nif they are in compliance. In the area of mental health care, this has \nbeen especially true. My proposed legislation amends the statute to \nensure that capacity funding levels are adjusted for inflation. We need \nto be talking about real dollars--not 1996 dollars--to get a true sense \nof VA's capacity to care for veterans with mental health needs.\n  This legislation would also mandate that VA carry out a number of \nmeasures designed to improve mental health and substance abuse \ntreatment capacity at Community-Based Outpatient Clinics and throughout \nthe VA system. Currently, many clinics do not even provide mental \nhealth services at all. My bill would ensure that at least 90 percent \nof all clinics can provide mental health services, either onsite or \nthrough referrals. Furthermore, it would establish more comprehensive \nperformance measures to provide incentives for clinics to maintain \nmental health capacity, for primary care doctors to screen patients for \nmental illness, and require that every primary health care facility be \nable to provide at least five days of inpatient detoxification \nservices.\n  Finally, the bill seeks to foster greater cooperation between VA and \nthe Department of Defense (DoD) in treating servicemembers and \nsubsequently veterans who suffer from some form of mental health or \nreadjustment disorder. It has been estimated that anywhere from 20 to \n30 percent of the men and women who are currently serving in Iraq and \nAfghanistan will require treatment for a mental health issue. The bill \nwould direct the two Departments to agree upon standardized separation \nscreening procedures for sexual trauma and mental health disorders, as \nwell as establish a joint VA-DoD Workgroup to examine potential ways of \ncombating stigma associated with mental illness, educate \nservicemembers' families, and make VA's expertise in the field of \nmental health more readily available to DoD providers.\n  We still have much work to do in the area of mental illness \nassociated with service in the armed forces. But this bill is a step in \nthe right direction. I ask my colleagues for their support of this \nbill, for it not only seeks to combat disorders that can be very \ndebilitating, but it also would protect specialized services that are \nat the heart of VA's mission.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1177\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Mental Health Care \n     Capacity Enhancement Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Mental health treatment capacity at community-based \n     outpatient clinics remains inadequate and inconsistent, \n     despite the requirement under section 1706(c) of title 38, \n     United States Code, that every primary care health care \n     facility of the Department of Veterans Affairs develop and \n     carry out a plan to meet the mental health care needs of \n     veterans who require such services.\n       (2) In 2001, the minority staff of the Committee on \n     Veterans' Affairs of the Senate conducted a survey of \n     community-based outpatient clinics and found that there was \n     no established systemwide baseline of acceptable mental \n     health service levels at such clinics.\n       (3) In 2004, the Department of Veterans Affairs workgroup \n     on mental health care, which developed and submitted a \n     Comprehensive Mental Health Strategic Plan to the Secretary \n     of Veterans Affairs, found service and funding gaps within \n     the Department of Veterans Affairs health care system, and \n     made numerous recommendations for improvements. As of May \n     2005, Congress had not received a final report on the \n     workgroup's findings.\n       (4) In February 2005, the Government Accountability Office \n     reported that the Department of Veterans Affairs had not \n     fully met any of the 24 clinical care and education \n     recommendations made in 2004 by the Special Committee on \n     Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder of the Under Secretary for \n     Health, Veterans Health Administration.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to reauthorize \nvarious programs servicing the needs of homeless veterans for fiscal \nyears 2007 through 2011, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, the Department of Veterans Affairs \nestimates that on any given day, as many as 200,000 veterans are \nhomeless. That is 200,000 men and women who have fought for this \ncountry who will go without the comfort of knowing that they will have \na roof over their head and a place to call home.\n  If 200,000 of our Nation's veterans will go homeless tonight, the VA \nestimates that about twice as many veterans will experience \nhomelessness this year. Again, that is 400,000 men and women who \ndefended this great Nation, who will be left out on the streets at some \npoint this year.\n  I hope my colleagues are as distressed as I am by these numbers, and \nI hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the bill I introduce \ntoday--the Shelter All Veterans Everywhere or ``SAVE'' Reauthorization \nAct of 2005.\n  This bill reauthorizes many of the soon-to-expire homeless veterans \nprograms currently serving this needy population, including the \nHomeless Providers Grant and Per Diem Program and the Homeless Veterans \nReintegration Program. These programs work to provide much-needed \nservices to homeless veterans so that they can find jobs and ultimately \nfind a stable home. These programs deserve to be continued. The SAVE \nReauthorization Act actually expands the reach of the Homeless Veterans \nReintegration Program, which provides job placement and training \nassistance, to include those veterans at risk of homelessness as well \nas those actually homeless, so that we can work to prevent homelessness \nbefore it happens.\n  At a time when so many of my colleagues are working to ensure that \nour Nation's veterans receive the benefits and services they have \nearned and deserve, we cannot forget the neediest of our veterans--the \nhomeless veterans. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting \nthese worthy programs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. \n        Alexander):\n  S. 1181. A bill to ensure an open and deliberate process in Congress \nby providing that any future legislation to establish a new exemption \nto section 552 of title 5, United States Code (commonly referred to as \nthe Freedom of Information Act) be stated explicitly within the text of \nthe bill; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, on February 16, shortly before the \nPresident's Day recess, the Senator from Vermont and I introduced the \nOPEN Government Act of 2005 (S. 394)--bipartisan legislation to promote \naccountability, accessibility, and openness in government, principally \nby strengthening and enhancing the Federal law commonly known as the \nFreedom of Information Act. s\n  When I served as Attorney General of Texas, it was my responsibility \nto enforce Texas's open government laws. I am pleased to report that \nTexas is known for having one of the strongest sets of open government \nlaws in our Nation. And since that experience, I have long believed \nthat our Federal Government could use ``a little Texas sunshine.'' I am \nthus especially enthusiastic about the OPEN Government Act, because \nthat legislation attempts to incorporate some of the most important \nprinciples and elements of Texas law into the Federal Freedom of \nInformation Act. And I am gratified that Senators Alexander, Feingold, \nIsakson, and Nelson of Nebraska are cosponsors of the bipartisan \nCornyn-Leahy bill.\n  This legislation enjoys broad support across the ideological \nspectrum. Indeed, since its introduction on February 16, the \nlegislation has attracted additional support. In particular, I am \npleased to report the endorsements of three conservative public \ninterest groups--one devoted to the defense of property rights, \nDefenders of Property Rights, led by Nancie G. Marzulla, one devoted to \nthe issue of racial preferences in affirmative action programs, One \nNation Indivisible, led by Linda Chavez, and one devoted to the \nprotection of religious liberty, Liberty Legal Institute, led by Kelly \nShackelford. I ask unanimous consent that their endorsement letters be \nprinted in the Record at the close of my remarks. The point of \nincluding these letters in the Record, of course, is not that these \ngroups are right or wrong in the pursuit of their respective causes, \nbut that the cause of open government is neither a Republican nor a \nDemocrat issue--neither a conservative nor a liberal issue--rather, it \nis an American issue.\n  I would like to take a few moments to emphasize one particular \nprovision of the Cornyn-Leahy bill--section 8. It is a common sense \nprovision. This provision should not be at all controversial, and \nindeed, I am not aware of any opposition whatsoever to it. The \nprovision would simply help to ensure an open and deliberate process in \nCongress, by providing that any future legislation to establish a new \nexemption to the Federal Freedom of Information Act must be stated \nexplicitly within the text of the bill. Specifically, any future \nattempt to create a new so-called ``(b)(3) exemption'' to the Federal \nFOIA law must specifically cite section (b)(3) of FOIA if it is to take \neffect. The justification for this provision is simple: Congress should \nnot establish new secrecy provisions through secret means. If Congress \nis to establish a new exemption to FOIA, it should do so in the open \nand in the light of day.\n  A recent news report published by the Cox News Service amply \ndemonstrates the importance of this issue, and specifically emphasizes \nthe need for section 8 of the Cornyn-Leahy bill. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a copy of this news report be printed at the close of my \nremarks.\n  Senator Leahy and I firmly believe that all of the provisions of the \nOPEN Government Act are important--and that, as the recent Cox News \nService report demonstrates, section 8 in particular is a worthy \nprovision that can and should be quickly enacted into law. We note that \nJuly 4 is the anniversary of the 1966 enactment of the original Federal \nFreedom of Information Act. Accordingly, we plan to devote our efforts \nthis month to getting section 8 approved by Congress and submitted to \nthe President for his signature by that anniversary date.\n  Toward that end, we rise today to introduce separate legislation to \nenact section 8 of the OPEN Government Act into law. We ask our \ncolleagues in this chamber to support this measure, first in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, and then on the floor of the United States Senate. \nAnd we look forward to working with our colleagues in the House--\nincluding Representative Lamar Smith, the lead sponsor of the OPEN \nGovernment Act in the House, H.R. 867, as well as Chairman Tom Davis, \nwho leads the House Committee on Government Reform, and Chairman Todd \nPlatts, who leads the House Government Reform subcommittee that \nrecently held a hearing to review the Federal FOIA law.\n  Section 8 of the Cornyn-Leahy bill is a common-sense, uncontroversial \nprovision that deserves the support of every member of Congress. It \nsimply provides that, when Congress enacts legislation--specifically, \nlegislation to exempt certain documents from disclosure under FOIA--it \ndo so in the open. After all, if documents are to be kept secret by an \nact of Congress, we should at least make sure that that very act of \nCongress itself not be undertaken in secret.\n\n[[Page S6160]]\n\n  A Senate Judiciary subcommittee held a hearing on the OPEN Government \nAct on March 15. I hope that at least section 8 of the legislation can \nbe enacted into law quickly, and that Congress will then move to \nconsider the other important provisions of the bill.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     May 25, 2005.\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: On behalf of the Defenders of Property \n     Rights, I would like to commend you on your introduction of \n     the Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National \n     Government Act of 2005 (OPEN Government Act). With this \n     legislation, Americans can have confidence that their \n     government is operating honestly and efficiently.\n       This proposed bill would be invaluable in aiding our quest \n     to protect the private property rights of all Americans. The \n     bill is beneficial for property rights plaintiffs--it puts \n     teeth into the requirement that the government timely respond \n     to requests while still protecting private property rights. \n     For instance, under the bill, if an agency does not respond \n     within the required 20 days, the agency may not assert any \n     exemption under subsection (b) of the bill unless disclosure \n     would endanger national security, ``disclose personal private \n     information protected by section 552a or proprietary \n     information,'' or would otherwise be prohibited by law. The \n     bill also provides for better review of agencies' responses \n     to FOIA requests and for disciplinary actions for arbitrary \n     and capricious rejections of requests. If passed, this bill \n     would surely help private property owners obtain faster \n     access to information regarding actions that have taken their \n     property--and provide better enforcement if they do not.\n       Your bill has our full and enthusiastic endorsement. We \n     thank you for your steadfast commitment to liberty, open \n     government, and constitutionally guaranteed property rights.\n           Yours truly,\n                                               Nancie G. Marzulla,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       One Nation Indivisible,\n\n                                                     May 19, 2005.\n     Senator John Cornyn,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: I am writing to tell you that One \n     Nation Indivisible supports the OPEN Government Act of 2005. \n     Good luck with its passage.\n       Sincerely,\n     Linda Chavez.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      Liberty Legal Institute,\n\n                                                     June 1, 2005.\nRe: ``OPEN Government Act'' bill\n\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: We are fully on board with your \n     efforts on Freedom of Information Act improvements. The \n     government should be open to its people. This is a core \n     requirement in any free society.\n       FOIA currently has little enforcement capability and was \n     also hurt by the wrongly decided Buckhannon decision. \n     Citizens deserve the protection of FOIA and the changes you \n     are proposing.\n       Please put us on your endorsement list for the ``OPEN \n     Government Act'' bill. In fact, we strongly believe the \n     Buckhannon error needs to be corrected for all Sec. 1983 \n     cases.\n       Last, even more abusive recently is the abuse of Rule 68 to \n     threaten and intimidate citizens already victimized once by \n     government officials. The idea that civil rights victims, who \n     win their suit (usually for just nominal damages), may have \n     to pay the government's costs is obscene and a complete \n     violation of Congressional intent. I hope we can fix this as \n     well.\n       Thank you for your service to all Texans.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Kelly Shackelford,\n                           Chief Counsel, Liberty Legal Institute.\n\n  There being no objection, the news report was ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Cox News Service, June 3, 2005]\n\n              Congress Cloaks More Information in Secrecy\n\n                           (By Rebecca Carr)\n\n       Washington.--Few would argue with the need for a national \n     livestock identification system to help the federal \n     government handle a disease outbreak such as mad cow.\n       But pending legislation calling for the nation's first \n     electronic livestock tracking system would prohibit the \n     public from finding out anything about animals in the system, \n     including the history of a cow sick with bovine spongiform \n     encephalopathy.\n       The only way the public can find out such details is if the \n     secretary of agriculture makes the information public.\n       That's because the legislation, sponsored by Rep. Collin C. \n     Peterson, D-Minn., includes a provision that exempts \n     information about the system from being released under the \n     Freedom of Information Act.\n       Formally called the ``third exemption,'' it is one of nine \n     exemptions the government can use to deny the release of \n     information requested under the FOI Act.\n       Open government advocates say it is the most troubling of \n     the nine exemptions because it allows Congress to cloak vital \n     information in secrecy through legislation, often without a \n     public hearing or debate. They say Congress frequently \n     invokes the exemption to appease private sector businesses, \n     which argue it is necessary to protect proprietary \n     information.\n       ``It is an easy way to slap a secrecy stamp on the \n     information,'' said Rick Blum, director of \n     openthegovernment.org, a coalition of more than 30 groups \n     concerned about government secrecy.\n       The legislative intent of Congress is far more difficult to \n     challenge than a federal agency's denial for the release of \n     information, said Kevin M. Goldberg, general counsel to the \n     American Society of Newspaper Editors.\n       ``This secrecy is often perpetuated in secret as most of \n     the (third exemption) provisions consist of one or two \n     paragraph tucked into a much larger bill with no notice that \n     the Freedom of Information Act will be affected at all,'' \n     Goldberg said.\n       There are at least 140 cases where congressional lawmakers \n     have inserted such exemptions, according to a 2003 Justice \n     Department report.\n       The report notes that Congress has been ``increasingly \n     active in enacting such statutory provisions.''\n       The exemptions have become so popular that finding them in \n     proposed legislation is ``like playing a game of Wackamole,'' \n     one staffer to Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., joked. ``As soon as \n     you handle one, another one pops up.''\n       Congress used the exemption in its massive Homeland \n     Security Act three years ago, granting businesses protection \n     from information disclosure if they agreed to share \n     information about the vulnerabilities of their facilities.\n       And in another twist on the exemption, Congress inserted a \n     provision into the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004 \n     that states that ``no funds appropriated under this or any \n     other act may be used to disclose'' records about firearms \n     tracking to the public.\n       Government agencies have also sought protection from \n     information disclosure.\n       For example, Congress passed an amendment to the National \n     Security Act in 1984 that exempted the CIA from having to \n     comply with the search and review requirements of the FOI Act \n     for its ``operational files.''\n       Most of the information in those files, which included \n     records about foreign and counterintelligence operations was \n     already protected from disclosure under the other exemptions \n     in the FOI Act.\n       But before Congress granted the exemption, the agency had \n     to search and review each document to justify withholding the \n     information, which cost time and money.\n       Open government advocates say many of the exemptions \n     inserted into legislation are not justified.\n       ``This is back door secrecy,'' said Thomas Blanton, \n     executive director of the National Security Archive at George \n     Washington University, a nonprofit research institute based \n     in Washington.\n       When an industry wants to keep information secret, it seeks \n     the so-called third exemption, he said.\n       ``It all takes place behind the sausage grinder,'' Blanton \n     said. ``You don't know what gristle is going through the \n     sport, you just have to eat it.''\n       But Daniel J. Metcalfe, co-director of the Justice \n     Department's Office of Information and Privacy, said the \n     exception is crucial to the FOI Act's structure.\n       In the case of the animal identification bill, the \n     exemption is critical to winning support from the cattle \n     industry and on Capitol Hill.\n       ``If we are going to develop an animal ID system that's \n     effective and meaningful, we have to respect participants' \n     private information,'' said Peterson, the Minnesota lawmaker \n     who proposed the identification system. ``The goal of a \n     national animal I.D. system is to protect livestock owners as \n     well as the public.''\n       As the livestock industry sees it, it is providing \n     information that will help protect the public health. In \n     exchange for proprietary information about their herds, they \n     believe they should receive confidence that their business \n     records will not be shared with the public.\n       ``The producers would be reluctant to support the bill \n     without the protection,'' said Bryan Dierlam, executive \n     director of government affairs at the National Cattleman's \n     Beef Association.\n       The animal identification on bill provides the government \n     with the information it needs to protect the public in the \n     event of an disease out break, Dierlam said. ``But it would \n     protect the producers from John Q. Public trying to willy-\n     nilly access their information.''\n       Food safety experts agree there is a clear need for an \n     animal identification system to protect the public, but they \n     are not certain that the exemption to the FOI Act is \n     necessary.\n       ``It's sad that Congress feels they have to give away \n     something to the cattle industry to achieve it,'' said \n     Caroline Smith DeWaal, director of the food safety program at \n     the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit \n     organization based in Washington.\n       Slipping the exemption into legislation without notice is \n     another problem cited by open government advocates!.\n       It has become such a problem that the Senate's strongest \n     FOI Act supporters, Sen.\n\n[[Page S6161]]\n\n     John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., proposed \n     that lawmakers be required to uniformly identify the \n     exemption in all future bills.\n       ``If Congress wants to create new exemptions, it must do so \n     in the light of day,'' Cornyn said. ``And it must do so in a \n     way that provides an opportunity to argue for or against the \n     new exemption--rather than have new exemptions creep into the \n     law unnoticed.''\n       Leahy agreed, saying that Congress must be diligent in \n     reviewing new exemptions to prevent possible abuses.\n       ``In Washington, loopholes tend to beget more loopholes, \n     and it's the same with FOI Act exemptions,'' Leahy said. \n     ``Focusing more sunshine on this process is an antidote to \n     exemption creep.''\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. For the third time this year, Senator Cornyn and I have \njoined to introduce common sense proposals to strengthen open \ngovernment and the Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA. The Senator \nfrom Texas has a long record of promoting open government, most \nsignificantly during his tenure as Attorney General of Texas. He and I \nhave forged a valuable partnership in this Congress to support and \nstrengthen FOIA. We introduced two bills earlier this year, and held a \nhearing on our bill, the Open Government Act, issues during Sunshine \nWeek in March.\n  The bill we introduce today is simple and straightforward. It simply \nrequires that when Congress sees fit to provide a statutory exemption \nto FOIA, it must state its intention to do so explicitly. The language \nof this bill was previously introduced as section eight of S. 394, the \nOpen Government Act.\n  No one argues with the notion that some government information is \nappropriately kept from public view. FOIA contains a number of \nexemptions for national security, law enforcement, confidential \nbusiness information, personal privacy, and other matters. One \nprovision of FOIA, commonly known as the (b)(3) exemption, states that \nrecords that are specifically exempted by statute may be withheld from \ndisclosure. Many bills that are introduced contain statutory \nexemptions, or contain language that is ambiguous and might be \ninterpreted as such by the courts. In recent years, we have seen more \nand more such exemptions offered in legislation. A 2003 Justice \nDepartment report stated that Congress has been ``increasingly active \nin enacting such statutory provisions.'' A June 3, 2005, article by the \nCox News Service titled, ``Congress Cloaks More Information in \nSecrecy,'' pointed to 140 instances ``where congressional lawmakers \nhave inserted such exemptions'' into proposed legislation. I commend \nthis article to my colleagues and understand that Senator Cornyn has \nplaced a copy in the Record.\n  Our shared principles of open government lead us to believe that \nindividual statutory exemptions should be vigorously debated before \nlawmakers vote in favor of them. Sometimes such proposed exemptions are \nclearly delineated in proposed legislation, but other times they amount \nto a few lines within a highly complex and lengthy bill. These are \ndifficult to locate and analyze in a timely manner, even for those of \nus who stand watch. As a result, such exemptions are often enacted with \nlittle scrutiny, and as soon as one is granted, others are requested.\n  The private sector has sought many exemptions in exchange for \nagreeing to share information with the government. One example of great \nconcern to me is the statutory exemption for critical infrastructure \ninformation that was enacted as part of the Homeland Security Act of \n2002, the law that created the Department of Homeland Security. In this \ncase, a reasonable compromise, approved by the White House, to balance \nthe protection of sensitive information with the public's right to know \nwas pulled out of the bill in conference. It was then replaced with \ntext providing an overly broad statutory exemption that undermines \nFederal and State sunshine laws. I have introduced legislation, called \nthe Restoration of Freedom of Information Act, to revert to that \nreasonable compromise language.\n  Not every statutory exemption is inappropriate, but every proposal \ndeserves scrutiny. Congress must be diligent in reviewing new \nexemptions to prevent possible abuses. Focusing more sunshine on this \nprocess is an antidote to exemption creep.\n  When we introduced the Open Government Act in February, we addressed \nthis matter with a provision that would require Congress to identify \nproposed statutory exemptions in newly introduced legislation in a \nuniform manner. Today, we introduce that single section as a new bill \nthat we hope can be enacted quickly.\n  I want to thank the Senator from Texas for his personal dedication to \nthese issues. I urge all members of the Senate to join us in supporting \nthis bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG:\n  S. 1182. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve \nhealth care for veterans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to introduce \nlegislation that will expand the services available to our Nation's \nveterans and their dependents, and improve the ability of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide health care services to \nthis same group of deserving Americans. I take a few moments now to \nexplain the provisions of this legislation.\n  First, the bill would, in section 2, exempt veterans enrolled for VA \ncare from all copayments for hospice care services provided by VA. Over \nthe past several years, VA has greatly expanded its efforts to provide \ncompassionate end-of-life care for our Nation's heroes. Last year, \nCongress made efforts to ensure that the surviving spouses and children \nwould not receive bills for such services following the deaths of such \nveterans who were in the hospice program. Unfortunately, last year's \nlegislation did not go far enough, and today some veterans' families \nare still paying for this care. This provision would end that practice \nin all hospice care settings.\n  Section 3 of the bill would exempt former Prisoners of War from \ncopayments that are applicable to care in a VA extended care facility. \nCongress has already exempted this deserving group of veterans from \nother VA medical copayments, and this provision would complete the \nrange of services available to these veterans free of charge. In \naddition, this section bill would remove the requirement that VA \nmaintain the exact number of nursing home care beds in VA facilities as \nit had during fiscal year 1998. Now before some suggest that I am \nadvocating the reduction in services available to veterans, I'd like to \nexplain how the current requirement came about and why I believe it \nshould be reconsidered.\n  The requirement that VA maintain a specified level of nursing home \nbeds was inserted into the law in 1999 when Congress enacted \nlegislation to expand options for non-institutional, long-term care \nservices available to veterans. At that time, some felt that by growing \nthe non-institutional care program, VA would seek simply to shut all of \nits institutional care capacity. So in a compromise, Congress decided \nthat fiscal year 1998 would be the year against which changes in the \ninstitutional care program would be measured. And then it required that \nVA maintain all of the beds it had in 1998.\n  Since 1998, VA has increased the number of veterans it treats by \nnearly 2 million. Yet, year after year, VA reports to Congress that it \ndoes not need to maintain the number of nursing home beds required by \nlaw. Does that mean VA is closing beds unnecessarily? No. It means VA \nhas followed the progress of medicine and is offering tens-of-thousands \nof veterans non-institutional care services while keeping them at home \nrather than in VA nursing home beds. I do not believe that Congress \nshould continue to mandate the maintenance of an arbitrarily-determined \nnumber of beds in a system that is trying to effectively use every \ndollar it can to provide real and needed services to our veterans. This \nprovision reflects that belief.\n  The fourth section of the legislation, if enacted, would ensure that \nveterans who seek emergency medical services at the nearby community \nmedical facilities are treated no differently financially than if the \ncare had been provided at a VA medical facility. This is an important \nissue in the provision of quality health care for our veterans. VA has \nsome evidence that veterans who need emergency services are bypassing \nlocal medical facilities, and are attempting to ``make it'' to a VA \nfacility even in the face of an emergency, because of concerns that \nVA's reimbursement policies for non-VA provided\n\n[[Page S6162]]\n\nemergency care will result in the veteran paying more out-of-pocket \ncosts. Clearly, that is not the kind of behavior Congress wants to \nencourage in our veterans. Nor is it good medicine. This provision \nwould clarify once and for all that veterans will be treated equally \nregardless of where emergency care treatment is sought.\n\n  Section 5 of the bill would authorize VA to provide or pay for up to \nthe first fourteen days of care for a newborn child of an enrolled \nfemale veteran who delivers her baby under VA provided, or VA financed, \ncare. As most of my colleagues know, VA provides what it calls a \n``comprehensive package of health benefits for eligible veterans.'' \nUnfortunately, for the increasing number of female veterans enrolling \nfor VA care, the word ``comprehensive'' does not include coverage for a \nnewborn's first few days of needed care. This type of arrangement is \ncommon in the private sector. In my judgment, this is an issue we must \naddress to assure our female service members that, as more and more of \nthem join the service and change the face of the American military, we \nwill make certain that the face of VA changes right along with it.\n  Section 6 would allow private health care providers to recoup costs \nfor care provided to children afflicted with spina bifida of Vietnam \nveterans--children who are, by law, entitled to VA-provided care--when \nthe costs are not fully covered by VA reimbursements. This so-called \n``balance billing'' authority would prohibit charging individual \npatients or veterans themselves. Only a beneficiary with private \ninsurance could have his or her insurance cover charges not covered by \nVA. This provision is important because it will provide a financial \nincentive to many providers who, unfortunately in some cases today, are \nnot willing to provide the very specialized services needed by these \nchildren because some costs are not reimbursed by VA at a sufficient \nrate.\n  Section 7 of this bill would increase the authorized level of funding \nfor the Homeless Grant and Per Diem Program at the Department of \nVeterans Affairs. I know all of my colleagues would agree that any man \nor woman who served this country in uniform should not be among the \nunfortunate Americans who find themselves on the street without \nshelter. VA has made tremendous strides in this area by providing grant \nprograms, health care services, mental health treatment, and other \nassistance to those veterans who do find themselves on the street. This \nprovision would ensure that good programs remain on track for the \nforeseeable future.\n  The eighth section of this bill would authorize VA medical centers to \nemploy Marriage and Family Therapists. I realize that to some of my \ncolleagues this may sound as though VA is beginning to become a family \nhealth care system and not a veterans' health care system. I want to \nassure any who harbor such concerns that this is not the intention or \nthe purpose of this proposed authority. Rather, this proposal seeks to \nrecognize that for some veterans, the trauma and experiences of war may \nlead to troubles at home. Often in these situations, treatment as a \nfamily is more effective for the betterment of the veteran. Of course, \npreservation of the family is an extremely important byproduct of this \ntreatment approach as well. I do not believe it is incompatible with \nthe mission of treating our veterans to focus on their family well-\nbeing when it is appropriate. The military is offering many of these \nservices already to those who are returning from overseas. These \nprograms are receiving good reviews from those in the mental health and \ncounseling professions. It seems only logical that we extend successful \nideas from the military experience to our veterans.\n  Section 9 would provide pay equity for the national Director of VA's \nNursing Service. Currently, this position is paid at a rate that is \nless than all of the other service chiefs at VA's Central Office. I \nbelieve correcting this inequity is not only a matter of fairness, but \na long overdue recognition that VA's nursing service is just as \nimportant to the provision of health services for our veterans as the \npharmacy service, the dental service, and other such services within \nVA.\n  Section 10 of this bill would allow VA to conduct cost-comparison \nstudies within its health care system. Mr. President, such studies are \ninvaluable tools for government to measure whether its current \nworkforce has identified the most efficient and effective means of \ndelivering services to our veterans, and value to the taxpayers. In my \nopinion, any organization that fails to measure its performance against \nothers in the same field will quickly cease to be an effective \norganization. VA is--and it must continue to be--an effective and \nefficient health care provider. This small change in the law will \nprovide one additional tool to ensure that is the case far into the \nfuture.\n  Section 11 of my legislation would focus on an area of great \nimportance to many members of the Senate: The treatment of mental \nhealth issues for those returning from service in Operations Iraqi \nFreedom and Enduring Freedom. I know many of us have read reports that \nestimate that as many as 20 percent of those serving overseas will need \nsome mental health care services to cope with the stress of serving in \na war zone. First, I want to say to my colleagues that the Department \nof Veterans Affairs already has in place numerous programs and services \nto respond to the needs of those veterans seeking care for mental \nhealth issues. Still, as Chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I \nbelieve it is important that we assure our brave servicemen and women, \nand the American people, that we are not satisfied with merely \nmaintaining VA's ability to provide mental health services. Rather, we \nmust assure that VA continues to improve and expand the treatment \noptions available.\n  This section of the bill would authorize $95 million in both fiscal \nyears 2006 and 2007 to improve and expand the mental health services \navailable to our Nation's veterans. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs \nwould be required to devote specific resources to certain \nimportant areas of treatment including, but not limited to $5 million \nto expand the number of clinical teams devoted to the treatment of \nPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder; $50 million to expand the services \navailable to diagnose and treat veterans with substance abuse problems; \n$10 million to expand tele-health capabilities in areas of the country \nwhere access to basic mental health services is nearly impossible; $1 \nmillion to improve educational programs available for primary care \nproviders to learn more about diagnosing and treating veterans with \nmental illness; $20 million to expand the number of community-based \noutpatient clinics with mental health services; and $5 million to \nexpand VA's Mental Health Intensive Case Management Teams.\n\n  I want to make it clear to my colleagues that I am taking this \napproach because I am concerned about the availability of these \nservices as much as anyone in the Senate. But, I am also concerned \nabout recent moves to ``micro-manage'' the VA health care system by \nrequiring, for example, that certain percentages of VA's budget be \nspent on one service or another, or that every VA facility have some \ncertain clinical service available. These approaches, while well-\nintentioned, run the risk of diverting important resources away from \nservices that are extremely important to our veterans. My approach is \nto put Congress on record as expecting improvements and expansion in \ncertain important programs, attaching a reasonable amount of money to \nthose efforts, and then monitoring the progress closely from the \nVeterans' Committee.\n  Section 12 addresses a point of legal contention that has restricted \nthe sharing of medical information between the Department of Defense \nand VA. As a result, record transfers for patients who would be VA \npatients are not arriving in VA hands as quickly and as seamlessly as \nthey should. This provision would make clear that DoD and VA may \nexchange health records information for the purpose of providing health \ncare to beneficiaries of one system who seek to quickly move to the \nother for services.\n  Section 13 of the bill would direct VA to expand the number VA \nemployees dedicated to serving the Veterans Readjustment Counseling \nService's Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) Outreach Program. The \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs held a hearing earlier this year at \nwhich two GWOT counselors testified on the numerous services their \nprogram provides to returning service\n\n[[Page S6163]]\n\nmembers, specifically Guardsmen and Reservists coming back from Iraq \nand Afghanistan. In many cases, these GWOT counselors are the first VA \nofficials to welcome home our troops at the airport, provide them with \ntheir first briefing on VA benefits and services, and steer those in \nneed to counseling services and health care centers. This is a \ncreative, vibrant program with only 50 employees that is just now \nbeginning to reach its peak effect on returning combat veterans. I \nbelieve VA should expand its efforts in this area to ensure we are \nreaching everyone we can.\n  Section 14 of this bill would require VA to expand the number of Vet \nCenters capable of providing tele-health services and counseling to \nveterans returning from combat. Currently there are 21 Vet Center \nfacilities that maintain this capability. And while that is a laudable \neffort, I believe we can do better. Tele-medicine offers a tremendous \nopportunity to bring many health services, particularly mental health \nservices, to veterans who reside in areas of the country where those \nservices would not otherwise be available. Practitioners are showing \ngreat results with tele-health services for mental health treatment, \nand our veterans are getting the services they need, closer to home, in \na more timely fashion. Expansion of such success only seems logical.\n  Finally, section 15 of this bill would require the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs to submit a report on all of the mental health data \nmaintained by VA, including the actual geographic locations of \ncollection and whether all of these points of data should continue to \nbe collected.\n  Over the next several weeks, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs will \nbe taking testimony on this bill and other legislation introduced by \nSenators to improve the range of services and benefits available to our \nNation's veterans. I look forward to working with my colleagues \nthroughout the rest of this session of Congress on these and other \nimportant efforts.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1182\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide additional assistance to recipients of \nFederal Pell Grants who are pursuing programs of study in engineering, \nmathematics, science, or foreign languages; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an important \nbill related to education and our national, homeland, and economic \nsecurity. I am pleased to be joined in this bipartisan effort with \nSenators Lieberman, Roberts, Stabenow, Allen, and Durbin. I am grateful \nto each of them for working closely with me in crafting this \nlegislation.\n  Our ability to remain ahead of the curve in scientific and \ntechnological advancements is a key component to ensuring America's \nnational, homeland and economic security in the post 9/11 world of \nglobal terrorism. Yet alarmingly, the bottom line is that America faces \na huge shortage of home-grown, highly trained scientific minds.\n  The situation America faces today is not unlike almost fifty years \nago. On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union successfully launched the \nfirst man-made satellite into space, Sputnik. The launch shocked \nAmerica, as many of us had just assumed that we were preeminent in the \nscientific fields. While prior to that unforgettable day America \nenjoyed an air of post World War II invincibility, afterwards our \nnation recognized that there was a cost to its complacency. We had \nfallen behind.\n  In the months and years to follow, we would respond with massive \ninvestments in science, technology and engineering. In 1958, Congress \npassed the National Defense Education Act to stimulate advancement in \nscience and math education. In addition, President Eisenhower signed \ninto law legislation that established the National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration (NASA). And a few years later, in 1961, President \nKennedy set the Nation's goal of landing a man on the moon within the \ndecade.\n  These investments paid off. In the years following the Sputnik \nlaunch, America not only closed the scientific and technological gap \nwith the Soviet Union, we surpassed them. Our renewed commitment to \nscience and technology not only enabled us to safely land a man on the \nmoon in 1969, it spurred research and development which helped ensure \nthat our modern military has always had the best equipment and \ntechnology in the world. These post-Sputnik investments also laid the \nfoundation for the creation of some of the most significant \ntechnologies of modern life, including personal computers and the \nInternet.\n  Why is any of this important to us today? Because as the old saying \ngoes--he or she who fails to remember history is bound to repeat it.\n  The truth of the matter is that today, America's education system is \ncoming up short in training the highly technical American minds that we \nnow need and will continue to need far into the future.\n  The 2003 Program for International Student Assessment found that the \nmath, problem solving, and science skills of fifteen year old students \nin the United States were below average when compared to their \ninternational counterparts in industrialized countries.\n  While slightly better news was presented by the recently released \n2003 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), it \nis still nothing we should cheer about. TIMSS showed that eighth grade \nstudents in the U.S. had lower average math scores than fifteen other \nparticipating countries. U.S. science scores weren't much better.\n  Our colleges and universities are not immune to the waning \nachievement in math and science education. The National Science \nFoundation reports the percentage of bachelor degrees in science and \nengineering have been declining in the U.S. for nearly two decades. In \nfact, the proportion of college-age students earning degrees in math, \nscience, and engineering was substantially higher in 16 countries in \nAsia and Europe than it was in the United States.\n  In the past, this country has been able to compensate for its \nshortfall in homegrown, highly trained, technical and scientific talent \nby importing the necessary brain power from foreign countries. However, \nwith increased global competition, this is becoming harder and harder. \nMore and more of our imported brain power is returning home to their \nnative countries. And regrettably, as they return home, many American \nhigh tech jobs are being outsourced with them.\n  The effects of these educational trends are already being felt in \nvarious important ways. For example: according to the National Science \nBoard, by 2010, if current trends continue, significantly less than 10 \npercent of all physical scientists and engineers in the world will be \nworking in America. The American Physical Society reports that the \nproportion of articles by American authors in the Physical Review, one \nof the most important research journals in the world, has hit an all \ntime low of 29 percent, down from 61 percent in 1983. And the U.S. \nproduction of patents, probably the most direct link between research \nand economic benefit, has declined steadily relative to the rest of the \nworld for decades, and now stands at only 52 percent of the total.\n  Fortunately, we already have an existing Federal program up and \nrunning that, if modified, can help. Under current law, the $14 billion \na year Pell Grant program awards recipients grants regardless of the \ncourse of study that the recipient chooses to pursue. So, under current \nlaw, two people from the same financial background are eligible for the \nsame grant even though one chooses to major in the liberal arts while \nthe other majors in engineering or science.\n  While I believe studying the liberal arts is an important component \nto having an enlightened citizenry, I also believe that given the \nunique challenges we are facing in this country, it is appropriate for \nus to add an incentive to the Pell Grant program to encourage \nindividuals to pursue courses of study where graduates are needed to \nmeet our national, homeland, and economic security needs.\n  That is why today I am introducing this legislation. The legislation \nis simple. It provides that at least every two\n\n[[Page S6166]]\n\nyears, our Secretary of Education, in consultation with the Secretary \nof Defense, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and others, should \nprovide a list of courses of study where America needs home-grown \ntalent to meet our national, homeland, and economic security needs. \nThose students who pursue courses of study in these programs will be \nrewarded with a doubling of their Pell Grant to help them with the \ncosts associated with obtaining their education.\n  We in the Congress have an obligation when expending taxpayer money, \nto do so in a manner that meets our nation's needs. Our Nation \ndesperately needs more highly trained domestic workers. That is an \nindisputable fact. And, in the Pell Grant program, we have \napproximately $14 billion that is readily available to help meet this \ndemand.\n  In closing, our world is vastly different today than it was when the \nPell Grant program was created in 1972. My legislation is a common-\nsense modification of the Pell Grant program that will help America \nmeet its new challenges. I hope my colleagues will join me in this \nendeavor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1183\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to waive the passport fees for a relative of a \ndeceased member of the Armed Forces proceeding abroad to visit the \ngrave of such member or to attend a funeral or memorial service for \nsuch member; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill to remedy a small \ngap in our passport laws. The change that I propose could be important \nto family members of servicemembers who lose their lives in service of \ntheir country.\n  Under current law, the State Department may not charge a fee to issue \na passport to relatives of a deceased member of the Armed Forces who \nare proceeding abroad to visit the grave of such a member. But the law \nas applied requires that the family be visiting an official gravesite \noverseas.\n  The law does not, however, allow the waiver of passport fees if the \nfamily is attending a funeral or memorial service for a servicemember \nkilled in action, but who is buried or memorialized overseas. The need \nfor such a waiver probably does not occur often, but it happens. Last \nyear, a servicemember from my home State of Delaware was killed in \naction in Iraq. The servicemember was stationed in Germany and his wife \nwas German. She wished for him to be buried in Germany. So all of his \nrelatives in the United States needed to travel quickly, and many of \nthem did not have passports. At a time of such grieving for a lost \nservicemember, the family of the fallen hero should not have to worry \nabout paying passport fees, which can add up quickly for a family, \nWaiving the fee in such cases is the least that we can do.\n  I hope we can approve such a minor change in the law quickly. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed at this \npoint in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1184\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthe same capital gains treatment for art and collectibles as for other \ninvestment property and to provide that a\n\n[[Page S6167]]\n\ndeduction equal to fair market value shall be allowed for charitable \ncontributions of literary, musical, artistic, or scholarly compositions \ncreated by the donor; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce again \nlegislation to eliminate one of the great inconsistencies in the \nInternal Revenue Code.\n  The bill I am introducing today with Senator Schumer is designed to \nrestore some internal consistency to the tax code as it applies to art \nand artists. No one has ever said that the tax code is fair even though \nit has always been a theoretical objective of the code to treat similar \ntaxpayers similarly.\n  The bill I am introducing today would address two areas where \nsimilarly situated taxpayers are not treated the same.\n  Internal inconsistency number one deals with the long-term capital \ngains tax treatment of investments in art and collectibles. If a person \ninvests in stocks or bonds and sells at a gain, the tax treatment is \nlong term capital gains. The top capital gains tax rate is 15 percent. \nHowever, if the same person invests in art or collectibles the top rate \nis hiked up to 28 percent. Art for art's sake should not incur a higher \ntax rate simply for revenue's sake. That is a big impact on the \npocketbook of the beholder.\n  Art and collectibles are alternatives to financial instruments as an \ninvestment choice. To create a tax disadvantage with respect to one \ninvestment compared to another creates an artificial market and may \nlead to poor investment allocations. It also adversely impacts those \nwho make their livelihood in the cultural sectors of the economy.\n  Santa Fe, NM, is the third largest art market in the country. We have \na diverse colony of artists, collectors and gallery owners. We have \nfabulous Native American rug weavers, potters and carvers. Creative \ngiants like Georgia O'Keeffe, Maria Martinez, E. L. Blumenshein, Allan \nHouser, R.C. Gorman, and Glenna Goodacre have all chosen New Mexico as \ntheir home and as their artistic subject. John Nieto, Wilson Hurley, \nClark Hulings, Veryl Goodnight, Bill Acheff, Susan Rothenberg, Bruce \nNauman, Agnes Martin, Doug Hyde, Margaret Nez, and Dan Ostermiller are \nadditional examples of living artists creating art in New Mexico.\n  Art, antiques, and collectibles are a $12 to $20 billion annual \nindustry nationwide. In New Mexico, it has been estimated that art and \ncollectible sales range between $500 million and one billion a year.\n  Economists have always been interested in the economics of the arts. \nAdam Smith is a well-known economist. He was also a serious, but \nlittle-known essayist on painting, dancing, and poetry. Similarly, \nKeynes was both a famous economist and a passionate devotee of \npainting. However, even artistically inclined economists have found it \ndifficult to define art within the context of economic theory.\n  When asked to define jazz, Louis Armstrong replied: ``If you gotta \nask, you ain't never going to know.'' A similar conundrum has \nchallenged Galbraith and other economists who have grappled with the \ndefinitional issues associated with bringing art within the economic \ncalculus. Original art objects are, as a commodity group, characterized \nby a set of attributes: every unit of output is differentiated from \nevery other unit of output; art works can be copied but not reproduced; \nand the cultural capital of the nation has significant elements of \npublic good.\n  Because art works can be resold, and their prices may rise over time, \nthey have the characteristics of financial assets, and as such may be \nsought as a hedge against inflation, as a store of wealth, or as a \nsource of speculative capital gain. A study by Keishiro Matsumoto, \nSamuel Andoh and James P. Hoban, Jr. assessed the risk-adjusted rates \nof return on art sold at Sotheby's during the 14-year period ending \nSeptember 30, 1989. They concluded that art was a good investment in \nterms of average real rates of return. Several studies found that rates \nof return from the price appreciation on paintings, comic books, \ncollectibles and modern prints usually made them very attractive long-\nterm investments. Also, when William Goetzmann was at the Columbia \nBusiness School, he constructed an art index and concluded that \npainting price movements and stock market fluctuations are correlated.\n  I conclude that with art, as well as stocks, past performance is no \nguarantee of future returns, but the gains should be taxed the same.\n  In 1990, the editor of Art and Auction asked the question: ``Is there \nan `efficient' art market?'' A well-known art dealer answered \n``Definitely not. That's one of the things that makes the market so \ninteresting.'' For everyone who has been watching world financial \nmarkets lately, the art market may be a welcome distraction.\n  Why do people invest in art and collectibles? Art and collectibles \nare something you can appreciate even if the investment doesn't \nappreciate. Art is less volatile. If buoyant and not so buoyant bond \nprices drive you berserk and spiraling stock prices scare you, art may \nbe the appropriate investment for you. Because art and collectibles are \ninvestments, the long-term capital gains tax treatment should be the \nsame as for stocks and bonds. This bill would accomplish that.\n  Artists will benefit. Gallery owners will benefit. Collectors will \nbenefit. And museums benefit from collectors. About 90 percent of what \nwinds up in museums like New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art comes \nfrom collectors.\n  Collecting isn't just for the hoity toity. It seems that everyone \ncollects something. Some collections are better investments than \nothers. Some collections are just bizarre. The Internet makes \ncollecting big business, and flea market fanatics are avid collectors. \nIn fact, people collect the darndest things. Books, duck decoys, chia \npets, snowglobes, thimbles, handcuffs, spectacles, baseball cards, and \nguns are a few such ``collectibles.''\n  For most of these collections, capital gains isn't really an issue, \nbut you never know. You may find that your collecting passion has \ncreated a tax predicament to phrase it politely. Art and collectibles \nare tangible assets. When you sell them, capital gains tax is due on \nany appreciation over your purchase price.\n  The bill provides capital gains tax parity because it lowers the top \ncapital gains rate from 28 percent to 15 percent.\n  Internal inconsistency number two deals with the charitable deduction \nfor artists donating their work to a museum or other charitable cause. \nWhen someone is asked to make a charitable contribution to a museum or \nto a fund raising auction, it shouldn't matter whether that person is \nan artist or not. Under current law, however, it makes a big \ndifference. As the law stands now, an artist/creator can only take a \ndeduction equal to the cost of the art supplies. The bill I am \nintroducing will allow a fair market deduction for the artist.\n  It's important to note that this bill includes certain safeguards to \nkeep the artist from ``painting himself a tax deduction.'' This bill \napplies to literary, musical, artistic, and scholarly compositions if \nthe work was created at least 18 months before the donation was made, \nhas been appraised, and is related to the purpose or function of the \ncharitable organization receiving the donation. As with other \ncharitable contributions, it is limited to 50 percent of adjusted gross \nincome (AGI). If it is also a capital gain, there is a 30 percent of \nAGI limit. I believe these safeguards bring fairness back into the code \nand protect the Treasury against any potential abuse.\n  I hope my colleagues will help me put this internal consistency into \nthe Internal Revenue Code.\n  I ask unanimous consent that and the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1186\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the Assistant Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity for the Transportation Security Administration to issue \nregulations requiring turbojet aircraft of air carriers to be equipped \nwith missile defense systems, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Commercial \nAirline Missile Defense Act. This legislation is designed to ensure \nthat our commercial aircraft are protected against the threat posed by \nshoulder-fired missiles.\n  I first introduced this legislation in February 2003 in response to \ntwo separate attacks attributed to al Qaeda terrorists. The first \nattack was the attempted shoot down of a U.S. military aircraft in \nSaudi Arabia. The second attack was against an Israeli passenger jet in \nKenya. Fortunately, there were no casualties in either case.\n  But make no mistake, the threat posed by these weapons--also known as \nman-portable air defense systems (MANPADS)--is very real. In May 2002, \nthe FBI said, ``. . . Given al Qaeda's demonstrated objective to target \nthe U.S. airline industry, its access to U.S. and Russian-made MANPAD \nsystems, and recent apparent targeting of U.S.-led military forces in \nSaudi Arabia, law enforcement agencies in the United States should \nremain alert to the potential use of MANPADS against U. S. aircraft.''\n  In February 2004, the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, \nAdmiral Lowell Jacoby, testified before the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee on current and projected national security threats. He stated \nthe following: ``A MANPAD attack against civilian aircraft would \nproduce large number of casualties, international publicity and a \nsignificant economic impact on aviation. These systems are highly \nportable, easy to conceal, inexpensive, available in the global weapons \nmarket and instruction manuals are on the internet. Commercial aircraft \nare not equipped with countermeasures and commercial pilots are not \ntrained in evasive measures. An attack could occur with little or no \nwarning. Terrorists may attempt to capitalize on these \nvulnerabilities.''\n  It is estimated that there are between 300,000 and one million \nshoulder-fired missiles in the world today--thousands are thought to be \nin the hands of terrorist and other non-state entities.\n  Since I first introduced my legislation in 2003, progress has been \nmade in adapting countermeasures now being used by the military for use \non commercial aircraft. A special program office has been created \nwithin the Department of Homeland Security that is working to \ndemonstrate and test two prototype countermeasure systems. Flight \ntesting is scheduled to begin in a matter of weeks.\n  This legislation, which I am again introducing with my primary \ncosponsor, Senator Schumer, states that the installation of \ncountermeasure systems on commercial aircraft will begin no later than \n6 months after the Secretary of Homeland Security certifies that the \ncountermeasure system has successfully completed a program of \noperational test and evaluation.\n  We need to continue to move forward to ensure that commercial \naircraft are protected from the threat posed by shoulder-fired \nmissiles. I appreciate the hard work of my colleague in the House, \nCongressman Steve Israel, who is a real leader on this issue.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/07/senate-section/article/S6168-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6168-S6170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 161--HONORING THE LIFE OF ROBERT M.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the extraordinary \nlife of Robert M. La Follette Sr. Next week, on June 14th, people \naround my home State of Wisconsin will mark the 150th anniversary of La \nFollette's birth. Throughout his life, La Follette was revered for his \ntireless service to the people of Wisconsin and to the people of the \nUnited States. His dogged, full-steam-ahead approach to his life's work \nearned him the nickname ``Fighting Bob.''\n  Robert Marion La Follette, Sr., was born on June 14, 1855, in \nPrimrose, a small town southwest of Madison in Dane County. He \ngraduated from the University of Wisconsin Law School in 1879 and, \nafter being admitted to the State bar, began his long career in public \nservice as Dane County district attorney.\n  La Follette was elected to the United States House of Representatives \nin 1884, and he served three terms as a member of that body, where he \nwas a member of the Ways and Means Committee.\n  After losing his campaign for reelection in 1890, La Follette \nreturned to Wisconsin and continued to serve the people of my State as \na judge. Upon his exit from Washington, DC, a reporter wrote, La \nFollette ``is popular at home, popular with his colleagues, and popular \nin the House. He is so good a fellow that even his enemies like him.''\n  He was elected the 20th Governor of Wisconsin in 1900. He served in \nthat office until 1906, when he stepped down in order to serve the \npeople of Wisconsin in the United States Senate, where he remained \nuntil his death in 1925.\n  As a founder of the national progressive movement, La Follette \nchampioned progressive causes as governor of Wisconsin and in the U.S. \nCongress. As governor, he advanced an agenda that included the \ncountry's first workers compensation system, direct election of United \nStates Senators, and railroad rate and tax reforms. Collectively, these \nreforms would become known as the ``Wisconsin Idea.'' As governor, La \nFollette also supported cooperation between the State and the \nUniversity of Wisconsin.\n  His terms in the House of Representatives and the Senate were spent \nfighting for women's rights, working to limit the power of monopolies, \nand opposing pork barrel legislation. La Follette also advocated \nelectoral reforms, and he brought his support of the direct election of \nUnited States Senators to this body. His efforts were brought to \nfruition with the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913. \nFighting Bob also worked tirelessly to hold the government accountable, \nand was a key figure in exposing the Teapot Dome Scandal.\n  La Follette earned the respect of such notable Americans as Frederick \nDouglass, Booker T. Washington and Harriet Tubman Upton for making \ncivil rights one of his trademark issues. At a speech before the 1886 \ngraduating class of Howard University, La Follette said, ``We are one \npeople, one by truth, one almost by blood. Our lives run side by side, \nour ashes rest in the same soil. [Seize] the waiting world of \nopportunity. Separatism is snobbish stupidity, it is supreme folly, to \ntalk of non-contact, or exclusion!''\n  La Follette ran for President three times, twice as a Republican and \nonce on the Progressive ticket. In 1924, as the Progressive candidate \nfor president, La Follette garnered more than 17 percent of the popular \nvote and carried the State of Wisconsin.\n  La Follette's years of public service were not without controversy. \nIn 1917, he filibustered a bill to allow the arming of United States \nmerchant ships in response to a series of German submarine attacks. His \nfilibuster was successful in blocking passage of this bill in the \nclosing hours of the 64th Congress. Soon after, La Follette was one of \nonly six Senators who voted against U.S. entry into World War I.\n  Fighting Bob was outspoken in his belief that the right to free \nspeech did not end when war began. In the fall of 1917, La Follette \ngave a speech about the war in Minnesota, and he was misquoted in press \nreports as saying that he supported the sinking of the Lusitania. The \nWisconsin State Legislature condemned his supposed statement as \ntreason, and some of La Follette's Senate colleagues introduced a \nresolution to expel him. In response to this action, he delivered his \nseminal floor address, ``Free Speech in Wartime,'' on October 16, 1917. \nIf you listen closely, you can almost hear his strong voice echoing \nthrough this chamber as he said: ``Mr. President, our government, above \nall others, is founded on the right of the people freely to discuss all \nmatters pertaining to their government, in war not less than in peace, \nfor in this government, the people are the rulers in war no less than \nin peace.''\n  Of the expulsion petition filed against him, La Follette said:\n\n       I am aware, Mr. President, that in pursuance of this \n     general campaign of vilification and attempted intimidation, \n     requests from various individuals and certain organizations \n     have been submitted to the Senate for my expulsion from this \n     body, and that such requests have been referred to and \n     considered by one of the Committees of the Senate.\n       If I alone had been made the victim of these attacks, I \n     should not take one moment of the Senate's time for their \n     consideration, and I believe that other Senators who have \n     been unjustly and unfairly assailed, as I have been, hold the \n     same attitude upon this that I do. Neither the clamor of the \n     mob nor the voice of power will ever turn me by the breadth \n     of a hair from the course I mark out for myself, guided \n     by such knowledge as I can obtain and controlled and \n     directed by a solemn conviction of right and duty.''\n\n  This powerful speech led to a Senate investigation of whether La \nFollette's conduct constituted treason. In 1919, following the end of \nWorld War I, the Senate dropped its investigation and reimbursed La \nFollette for the legal fees he incurred as a result of the expulsion \npetition and corresponding investigation. This incident is indicative \nof Fighting Bob's commitment to his ideals and of his tenacious spirit.\n  La Follette died on June 18, 1925, in Washington, DC, while serving \nWisconsin in this body. His daughter noted, ``His passing was \nmysteriously peaceful for one who had stood so long on the battle \nline.'' Mourners visited the Wisconsin Capitol to view his body, and \npaid respects in a crowd nearing 50,000 people. La Follette's son, \nRobert M. La Follette, Jr., was appointed to his father's seat, and \nwent on to be elected in his own right and to serve in this body for \nmore than 20 years, following the progressive path blazed by his \nfather.\n\n[[Page S6170]]\n\n  La Follette has been honored a number of times for his unwavering \ncommitment to his ideals and for his service to the people of Wisconsin \nand of the United States.\n  Recently, I was proud to support Senate passage of a bill introduced \nin the other body by Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin that will name the \npost office at 215 Martin Luther King, Jr., Boulevard in Madison in La \nFollette's honor. I commend Congresswomen Baldwin for her efforts to \npass this bill.\n  The Library of Congress recognized La Follette in 1985 by naming the \nCongressional Research Service reading room in the Madison Building in \nhonor of both Fighting Bob and his son, Robert M. La Follette, Jr., for \ntheir shared commitment to the development of a legislative research \nservice to support the United States Congress. In his autobiography, \nFighting Bob noted that, as governor of Wisconsin, he ``made it a . . . \npolicy to bring all the reserves of knowledge and inspiration of the \nuniversity more fully to the service of the people. . . . Many of the \nuniversity staff are now in state service, and a bureau of \ninvestigation and research established as a legislative reference \nlibrary . . . has proved of the greatest assistance to the legislature \nin furnishing the latest and best thought of the advanced students of \ngovernment in this and other countries.'' He went on to call this \nservice ``a model which the federal government and ultimately every \nstate in the union will follow.'' Thus, the legislative reference \nservice that La Follette created in Madison served as the basis for his \nwork to create the Congressional Research Service at the Library of \nCongress.\n  The La Follette Reading Room was dedicated on March 5, 1985, the \n100th anniversary of Fighting Bob being sworn in for his first term as \na Member of Congress.\n  Across this magnificent Capitol in National Statuary Hall, Fighting \nBob is forever immortalized in white marble, still proudly representing \nthe State of Wisconsin. His statue resides in the Old House Chamber, \nnow known as National Statuary Hall, among those of other notable \nfigures who have made their marks in American history. One of the few \nseated statues is that of Fighting Bob. Though he is sitting, he is \nshown with one foot forward, and one hand on the arm of his chair, as \nif he is about to leap to his feet and begin a robust speech.\n  When then-Senator John F. Kennedy's five-member Special Committee on \nthe Senate Reception Room chose La Follette as one of the ``Five \nOutstanding Senators'' whose portraits would hang outside of this \nchamber in the Senate reception room, he was described as being a \n``ceaseless battler for the underprivileged'' and a ``courageous \nindependent.'' Today, his painting still hangs just outside this \nchamber, where it bears witness to the proceedings of this body--and, \nperhaps, challenges his successors here to continue fighting for the \nsocial and government reforms he championed.\n  To honor Robert M. La Follette, Sr., on the sesquicentennial of his \nbirth, today I am introducing three pieces of legislation. I am pleased \nto be joined in this effort by the senior Senator from Wisconsin, \nSenator Kohl. The first is a resolution celebrating this event and \nrecognizing the importance of La Follette's important contributions to \nthe Progressive movement, the State of Wisconsin, and the United States \nof America.\n  I am also introducing a bill that would direct the Secretary of the \nTreasury to mint coins to commemorate Fighting Bob's life and legacy. \nThe third bill that I am introducing today would authorize the \nPresident to posthumously award a gold medal on behalf of Congress to \nRobert M. La Follette, Sr. The minting of a commemorative coin and the \nawarding of the Congressional Gold Medal would be fitting tributes to \nthe memory of Robert M. La Follette, Sr., and to his deeply held \nbeliefs and long record of service to his State and to his country. I \nhope that my colleagues will support all three of these proposals.\n  Let us never forget Robert M. La Follette, Sr.'s character, his \nintegrity, his deep commitment to Progressive causes, and his \nunwillingness to waver from doing what he thought was right. The Senate \nhas known no greater champion of the common man and woman, no greater \nenemy of corruption and cronyism, than ``Fighting Bob'' La Follette, \nand it is an honor to speak in the same chamber, and serve the same \ngreat State, as he did.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/07/senate-section/article/S6170-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6170-S6171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 162--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING \n                        GRISWOLD V.

Connecticut paved the \n     way for widespread use of birth control among American women;\n       Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     recognized family planning in its published list of the ``Ten \n     Great Public Health Achievements in the 20th Century'';\n       Whereas the typical woman in the United States wants only 2 \n     children and therefore spends roughly 30 years of her life \n     trying to prevent pregnancy;\n       Whereas birth control is a critical component of basic \n     preventive health care for women and has been the driving \n     force in reducing national rates of unintended pregnancy and \n     the need for abortion;\n       Whereas the ability of women to control their fertility and \n     avoid unintended pregnancy has led to dramatic declines in \n     maternal and infant mortality rates and has improved maternal \n     and infant health;\n       Whereas in 1965, there were 31.6 maternal deaths per \n     100,000 live births and in 2000 there were 9.8 maternal \n     deaths per 100,000 live births;\n       Whereas in 1965, 24.7 infants under 1 year of age died per \n     1,000 live births and in 2003 this figure had declined to 7 \n     infant deaths per 1,000 live births;\n       Whereas the ability of women to control their fertility has \n     enabled them to achieve personal educational and professional \n     goals critical to the economic success of the United States;\n       Whereas in 1965, 7 percent of women completed 4 or more \n     years of college compared to 26 percent in 2004;\n       Whereas in 1965, women age 16 and over constituted 39 \n     percent of the workforce compared to 59 percent in 2004;\n       Whereas publicly-funded family planning programs have \n     increased the ability of women, regardless of economic \n     status, to access birth control and experience the resulting \n     health and economic benefits;\n       Whereas public investment in this most basic preventive \n     health care is extremely cost effective--for every dollar \n     spent on publicly funded family planning, $3 is saved in \n     pregnancy-related and newborn care cost to the Medicaid \n     program alone;\n       Whereas Congress had repeatedly recognized the importance \n     of a women's ability to access contraceptives through support \n     for Medicaid, title X of the Public Health Service Act, and \n     the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program;\n       Whereas 40 years after the Griswold decision, many women \n     still face challenges in accessing birth control and using it \n     effectively;\n       Whereas the United States has one of the highest rates of \n     unintended pregnancy among Western nations and each year, \n     half of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended, \n     and nearly half of those end in abortion;\n       Whereas teen pregnancy rates have dramatically declined, \n     still, 78 percent of teen pregnancies are unintended and more \n     than one-third of teen girls will become pregnant before age \n     20; and\n       Whereas publicly funded family planning clinics are the \n     only source of healthcare for many uninsured and low-income \n     women:\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) forty years ago the United States Supreme Court in \n     Griswold v. Connecticut held that married people have a \n     constitutional right to use contraceptives, a right that the \n     Court would extend to unmarried individuals within less than \n     a decade;\n       (2) the ability of women to control their fertility through \n     birth control has vastly improved maternal and infant health, \n     has reduced national rates of unintended pregnancy, and has \n     allowed women the ability to achieve personal educational and \n     professional goals critical to the economic success of the \n     United States; and\n       (3) Congress should take further steps to ensure that all \n     women have universal access to affordable contraception.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today we mark forty years since a momentous \nSupreme Court decision. It is difficult for many young Americans to \nimagine that in the not too distant past, the provision of \ncontraceptives was illegal.\n\n[[Page S6171]]\n\nIn the 1965 landmark decision of Griswold v. Connecticut, the Supreme \nCourt recognized the right of married couples to obtain contraception \nand reproductive counseling. This was a watershed moment in public \nhealth--indeed such that the CDC has recognized that our subsequent \nprogress in family planning constitutes one of the ten greatest public \nhealth achievements of the last century.\n  Women have faced great obstacles in family planning. While the \naverage woman desires two children, with more than thirty years of \nfertility a woman's health and the welfare of her family is compromised \nwithout modern contraception.\n  We know that family planning has been practiced throughout history, \nbut the methods used were certainly not always safe and effective. \nToday we take for granted both the access to modern contraceptives and \nthe individual's right to make reproductive decisions. Among our \nnoblest intentions is that every child is wanted, and that parents will \nhave the resources to ensure their child's health and success. \nFollowing the Griswold decision, we have come far closer to that goal.\n  We certainly can see the results. The maternal death rate in the U.S. \nis only one third what is was back in 1965. The same is true for infant \nsurvival. The health outcomes are indisputable.\n  The lives of women have also been improved in so many ways. Four \ntimes more women are now college educated. This is so vital in an age \nwhere a more competitive world demands so much more of American \nfamilies. It is essential that women can better themselves and ensure \nthe security of their families.\n  As we commemorate the recognition by the Supreme Court that \nindividuals have a right to that most basic part of life--the planning \nof their families--we recognize that there is still a great deal of \nprogress to be made. Legal access does not equate to affordability. \nCertainly we must adequately fund Medicaid, title X, and other programs \nwhich provide family planning services. Such access reduces unwanted \npregnancies, promotes the economic stability of families, and improves \nthe health of both mother and child, yet we need to do more.\n  We simply must assure that access to contraceptives is equitable--\nthat a lack of coverage by health plans does not place one of our most \neffective public health measures out of reach for millions of women. To \nachieve this aim, I will again introduce the Equity in Prescription \nInsurance and Contraceptive Act with Senator Reid later this week. I \ninvite my colleagues to join us in supporting this legislation to \nrealize the full promise of Griswold v. Connecticut--healthier mothers, \nhealthier children, and healthy, stable families.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, today marks the 40th anniversary of the \nU.S. Supreme Court decision in Griswold v. Connecticut, which struck \ndown Connecticut laws that prohibited reproductive counseling and the \nuse of contraception. In recognizing a constitutional right to privacy, \nthis landmark decision secured the right of married women to use \ncontraception and laid the groundwork for widespread access to birth \ncontrol for all American women.\n  The availability and use of contraceptives has had a profound impact \non the health and lives of women across the Nation. Widespread use of \nbirth control has led to dramatic reductions in national rates of \nsexually transmitted infections, unintended pregnancies, and abortion. \nContraceptive use has also significantly improved maternal and infant \nhealth outcomes, and reduced maternal and infant mortality rates. Since \n1965 maternal and infant mortality rates have declined by more than \ntwo-thirds.\n  The impact of contraception on the professional lives of women has \nbeen equally profound. The ability of women to control fertility has \nallowed them to successfully achieve educational and career goals that \nwould've been impossible a century ago. Women are critical to this \nnation's economic success, comprising up to one half of the total U.S. \nlabor force.\n  In 1999, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recognized \nthe significant impact of birth control on American society and \nincluded family planning in their list of the ``Ten Great Public Health \nAchievements in the 20th Century.'' However, despite considerable \nprogress in this area, much work remains. The United States has one of \nthe highest rates of unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted \ninfections among industrialized nations, which in part reflects lack of \naccess to basic preventive health care, including contraception.\n  A growing number of women--almost 17 million currently--must rely on \npublicly supported contraceptive care. Between 2000 and 2002, this \nnumber increased by 400,000 alone, because of the rising number of \nuninsured women. Yet, even those women with health insurance are not \nguaranteed access to contraceptives because some health plans choose \nnot to cover these medications and procedures as they would other basic \npreventive health measures. And we are increasingly hearing about \npharmacists and other providers who refuse to prescribe or fill \ncontraceptive prescriptions, or refer women to those who will, because \nof their own personal beliefs.\n  This 40th anniversary of the Griswold decision provides a perfect \nopportunity to reflect upon the critical importance and impact of this \ndecision on the health and professional lives of millions of women. We \nmust ensure that policy decisions about contraception services remain \nhealth decisions and not political ones, and work to ensure that all \nwomen have access to contraception when they need it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/07/senate-section/article/S6171-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6171-S6172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n           committee on agriculture, nutrition, and forestry\n\n  Mr. DeMINT.

The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for allowing \nme to have this time. I acknowledge all his hard work to bring us to \nhaving votes. And that is true of the minority leader. The Senate is \nback in business and we are voting in the fashion of 214 years of our \nhistory and some good people are getting voted on. That is all we can \nask or hope for.\n  I rise to speak on behalf of Justice Janice Rogers Brown. I intend to \nvote for her tomorrow when the vote is called. Being from the South, \nbeing from South Carolina, about to turn 50, I can say it is a long way \nfrom Greenville, AL, as a daughter of a sharecropper to the Supreme \nCourt of California; an African-American female who grew up in the \nsegregated South, daughter of a sharecropper in Greenville, AL, growing \nup, listening to stories from a grandmother about famous NAACP lawyer \nFred Gray, who defended Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks.\n  It is a long way--and most of it is uphill. But she made it. And we \nought to all be proud of the fact that someone such as Janice Rogers \nBrown has accomplished so much in her life. Not only did she go from \nGreenville, AL, to the Supreme Court of California, she served with \ndistinction.\n  California has a unique system in the sense that the voters can \ndecide whether they want to retain a judge. The last time she was up \nfor retention vote in California she received 76 percent of the vote. \nWe can talk about this as long as we would like, and apparently 30 \nhours is as long as we are going to talk about it. I find it hard to \nbelieve that someone could be out of the mainstream to the point they \nare a rightwing judicial fanatic and still get 76 percent of the vote \nin California. The last time I checked, it is not exactly the haven of \nrightwing people.\n  The reason she received 76 percent of the vote in California is \nbecause nobody made a big deal about her being a judge. The fact is, \nshe decided a lot of cases with a variety of issues and a consistent \nmanner that made it so that people who came before her did not feel the \nneed to go out and try to get her beat. Only after the fact, only when \nshe gets in this political whirlwind we are in now, where every Federal \ncourt nominee is getting attacked in a variety of different ways, \nmainly on the lines that you are out of the mainstream because you \nhappen to be conservative, only then has she gotten to be a problem.\n  This is politics, pure and simple, because if it was about \ncompetency, if it was about professional qualifications, she would \nnever have been on the Supreme Court in California to start with. She \nwould not have stayed 7 or 8 years, and she would not have gotten 76 \npercent of the vote. To say otherwise defies common sense.\n  We are going to take a vote tomorrow. She is going to be confirmed to \nthe Federal bench on the court of appeals. She is a good candidate for \nthat position. Not only is the California Supreme Court a good training \nground for such a position, her story as a person is a great reservoir \nfor her to call upon.\n  The idea that she cannot relate to people who suffer and who have \nbeen dealt a difficult time is absurd given her life circumstance. She \nwill be an ideal court of appeals judge because\n\n[[Page S6173]]\n\nshe was a very solid supreme court justice.\n  Is she conservative? You better believe it. The last time I checked, \nthat is not a disqualifier. As a matter of fact, I think that is \nexactly what the country needs right now. We need Federal judges who \nwill interpret the law and not make it. The Federal judiciary has lost \nits way on many occasions. She will be part of the solution, not the \nproblem.\n\n  For 25 years she has been a public servant. She has worked for the \nlegal assistance folks in California doing things for people who are \nless fortunate. She has been an outstanding jurist. She is a smart \nlady. She graduated near the top of her class and has given back more \nthan she has taken.\n  The road from Greenville, AL, to the Supreme Court of California now \nleads to the Federal bench. We all should be proud of the fact that \nsomeone like this has done so much for so many people. Instead of \npicking apart every word she said, we should celebrate her success \nbecause come tomorrow, she will be a Federal judge. The country will be \nbetter off for it. We will be a stronger nation having someone like her \non the Federal bench.\n  I am very proud of what she has accomplished as a person. I am very \nsupportive of her judicial tenure, her judicial reasoning. She will \nbring out the best in our Nation's legal system.\n  One final thought: Politicians live in a world of 50 plus 1. We think \nof the most awful things we can say about each other just to get these \njobs and to hold on to them sometimes. More and more people are turned \noff by politics because it is 24/7, running each other down. I wish we \ncould stop.\n  Let me tell you about the present Presiding Officer. He has the \nperfect demeanor, as far as I am concerned, about a political figure. \nThe Presiding Officer has had many jobs, and he has carried himself \nwell. But we are adrift in politics. We are trying to find who is the \nleast bad among us. By the time we get through with each other, nobody \nwants to vote for anybody. That needs to be corrected. At least we \nvolunteer for this. We go in it with our eyes wide open. If we continue \nto do to judges what we have embarked on for the last 15 or 20 years, \nwe will do great damage to the judiciary.\n  This lady has been called a Neanderthal. She has been called some \nnames you would not call your political opponent. There is a lot that \nhas been said about Janice Rogers Brown that is over the top and is \nunfair. But she stuck it out and she will have her vote and she will \nwin.\n  Let me state to all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, \nwhatever our Democrat friends have done, we are capable of doing the \nsame on our side. If we do not slow down, take a deep breath and \nreassess what we are doing to judicial nominees, we will destroy the \nindependence of the judiciary because it has become another form. If \nyou have ever had a thought in your life and you have expressed it, it \nwill be used against you in a political fashion, not a qualification \nfashion.\n  I hope we will learn from the past 15 or 20 years and declare a \ncease-fire on the judiciary. If you do not like people, vote against \nthem. If they have bad character or bad ethics, bring it up and we will \ncome together and deal with that. I hope we will stop declaring war on \nthese people in such a personal fashion because the downside of this is \ngood men and women of the future who would want to be judges are going \nto take a pass. Who in their right mind in the future is going to put \ntheir family and themselves through what these nominees have gone \nthrough? They do not have to. They have decided not to get in the \npolitical arena. They decided to devote themselves to the rule of law.\n  The difference between my business and the courtroom is the \ndifference between very loud and very quiet. Pack your political agenda \nat the courthouse door, at the courthouse steps. The courtroom is a \nquiet place where you are judged based on what you do, not who you are. \nYou do not have to pay in the American legal system because you have a \nbig wallet. In the American political system, we hit the rich pretty \nroutinely. In the American political system, the unpopular have zero \nchance because they do not poll well.\n  In a courtroom, we do not take any polls. We look at what you do, not \nwhere you came from, and we let your peers, the citizens of the \ncommunity, decide your fate, with somebody presiding over the trial \nwith no ax to grind. What a marvelous system.\n  The jury is not special interest groups. They are not out raising \nmoney. They do not get rewarded or punished. They leave when the case \nis over, and they get a few dollars for their time. And do you know \nwhat. It works marvelously well. And that person in a black robe is \nnobody's campaign manager. They are there to call the balls and the \nstrikes. This has worked well for 214 years. And if we do not watch it, \nwe are going to ruin it.\n  Hopefully, over the next coming weeks, we can get back to the \ntraditions of the Senate, treat people with the courtesy they deserve, \nand if you do not think they will be a good judge, vote against them. I \nthink that is your obligation. The name-calling needs to stop.\n  So come tomorrow, at 5 o'clock, Janice Rogers Brown is going to \ncontinue her journey from Greenville, AL, and she is going to wear the \nrobe of a Federal court judge. I think that is something we all should \ncelebrate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/07/senate-section/article/S6173-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
