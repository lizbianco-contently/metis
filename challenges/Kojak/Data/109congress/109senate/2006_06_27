Mr. President, in the coming weeks, we are entering an \nimportant crossroad in the future of commercial aerospace. I wish to \nexplain this morning what is at stake for our country and for American \nworkers.\n  Down one road, American workers will be left to fight for their jobs \nwith one hand tied behind their backs. They will face unfair \ncompetition, and our economy and our future could suffer. Down the \nother road, our Government will make it clear that we will fight for \nfair trade, and our economy and our workers will win as a result. That \nis the crossroad we are approaching, and which path we take will be \ndetermined by two things: whether Europe decides to provide illegal \nsubsidies to Airbus and EADS and whether the U.S. Government works \naggressively to keep that from happening.\n  For decades, Europe has provided subsidies to prop up Airbus and its \nparent company EADS. Those subsidies have created an uneven playing \nfield and have led to tens of thousands of layoffs in the United \nStates.\n\n[[Page S6500]]\n\n  In the past few years, the United States has stood up to Europe, and \nI have been proud to work with the Bush administration in that effort, \nfirst under U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick, then under Rob \nPortman and now, of course, under USTR Susan Schwab. We have demanded \nthat Europe stop the subsidies and play by the rules.\n  With the threat of a WTO trade case, we got the Europeans to the \nnegotiating table, and I was hopeful that we could make progress. But \nover the past few months, Airbus and EADS have been in a tailspin over \nunsuccessful planes, production delays, and management scandals. Airbus \nis finally beginning to see how difficult it is to compete in the \nmarketplace without the cushion of government subsidies. And it is \nfloundering.\n  But now, rather than letting Airbus compete on its own in the \nmarketplace, European governments seem poised once again to rescue \nAirbus with market-distorting subsidies.\n  If we want to keep a strong aerospace industry in America, we cannot \nlet that happen. Every time the European government underwrites Airbus \nwith subsidies, American workers get pink slips.\n  If we want to lead the world in commercial aerospace, our message to \nEurope must be strong and clear: No more illegal subsidies to prop up \nAirbus. Airbus must compete in the marketplace just like everyone else.\n  I first sounded the alarm on this important issue in March of 2004 \nwhen I spoke about my concerns here on the Senate floor. For those who \nhave not been following the debate, I wish to provide some background.\n  Only two companies in the world make large passenger airplanes: the \nBoeing company, with its commercial air operation headquartered in \nRenton, WA, and Airbus, which is headquartered in Toulouse, France. \nAirbus is a division of the European Aeronautics Defense and Space \nCompany, known as EADS.\n  The distance between Airbus and Boeing's headquarters is about as big \nas the disparity between how the United States and Europe view the \ncommercial aerospace industry.\n  For us in America, commercial aerospace is a private industry, one \nthat must respond to the needs of the marketplace and the demands of \nits shareholders. It is a difficult business, and many times \nmanufacturers such as Boeing ``bet the company'' on a new airplane.\n  In Europe, on the other hand, commercial aerospace is viewed as a \njob-creation program. Airbus has been shielded from the dangers of the \nmarketplace by decades of government subsidies. In fact, Europe doesn't \nseem to care if Airbus loses money as long as it produces jobs and \nthose jobs come at the expense of American workers.\n  The history of Airbus and EADS is a history of government subsidies \nthat have sheltered it from competition and real pressures of the \nmarketplace. It has allowed Airbus to develop new aircraft with \nvirtually no risk. This government assistance takes many forms, \nincluding launch subsidies, research subsidies, facilities subsidies, \nand supplier subsidies. These subsidies create an uneven playing field \nand allow Airbus to do things that normal private companies cannot \nafford to do. Because of those subsidies, Airbus has grown to become a \nmarket power without assuming any of the financial risk and \naccountability U.S. firms have to contend with every day.\n  As a result of this government support, Airbus has been able to erode \nBoeing's market share. Airbus's market share was once in the teens, but \ntoday Airbus claims to supply more than 50 percent of the industry.\n  But European government support of Airbus doesn't stop there. It \nincludes everything from bribes to threats. There are reports of state \nairlines being promised landing rights at European airports if they buy \nAirbus planes, and we have seen countries threatened that they will not \nbe let into the European Union unless they buy Airbus planes. There are \nreports of Airbus using deep discounts and guaranteeing to airlines \nthat Airbus planes will hold their value.\n  To date, Airbus has received more than $15 billion in launch aid. But \ndespite this massive infusion of government cash, Airbus and EADS are \nstill hemorrhaging money and are undergoing a crisis in leadership at \nthe highest levels. In fact, if anybody was to scan the newspapers this \nweek, they could read about any number of problems Airbus and EADS have \nbeen confronted with. The Airbus A350 model has been widely condemned \nby major airline purchasers. It requires an expensive redesign, which \nis estimated to now cost between $9 billion and $10 billion. The A380 \nmega-jetliner, which Airbus spent more than $13 billion on developing, \nhas secured only a small list of customers. Now it is plagued by \ndelivery delays which could result in canceled orders and financial \npenalties for Airbus. In fact, according to recent reports, Airbus is \nfacing the possible loss of orders worth more than $5 billion. The \ndelays could reduce Airbus's annual earnings by $630 million between \n2007 and 2010.\n  EADS also has a huge liability on its hands. It needs to buy out BAE \nSystems' share of Airbus, which is estimated to cost about $4 billion. \nOn top of all of that, the co-chief executive of EADS, Noel Forgeard, \nis under investigation for insider trading.\n  By all accounts, Airbus is struggling. It is also losing credibility \nwith its customers. In fact, when news broke about the A380's \nproduction delay, Singapore Airlines cast a no-confidence vote in \nAirbus by ordering 20 Boeing 787 Dreamliners.\n  One important customer who is taking notice is the U.S. Department of \nDefense. With Airbus's financial house of cards on the verge of \ncollapse and no current U.S. manufacturing presence, it is becoming \nclear that EADS will not be able to give the U.S. Air Force the tanker \nof the future.\n  I am pleased that the Air Force has asked the right questions. In its \nrequest for information for the tanker contract, the Air Force asked \npotential bidders to provide them with information about launch aid and \nsubsidies, including details about any government support, tax breaks, \ndebt forgiveness, or loans with preferential terms they might have \nreceived. The Air Force clearly understands the need for transparency \nand a level playing field.\n  Any new subsidies to Airbus for tankers or other programs should end \nonce and for all Airbus's campaign to access the U.S. Treasury.\n  To protect taxpayers and national security, the Air Force must \nexercise extreme caution if it continues to consider an Airbus tanker \nproposal.\n  As many of my colleagues know, my home State of Washington has a very \nproud and long history of aerospace leadership. On July 15, 1916, Bill \nBoeing started his airplane company in Seattle, WA, and since that day, \nBoeing and Washington State have shared the ups and downs of the \ncommercial aerospace industry. In fact, just a few years ago, Boeing \nfound itself struggling to keep up with Airbus, but through the \nsacrifice and hard work of more than 62,000 Boeing employees in \nWashington State and many more around the country, the company pulled \nitself up by its bootstraps. It recovered to once again evenly share \nthe marketplace with Airbus, and it did so by producing a plane, the \n787, which was just what the marketplace wanted.\n  Airbus, on the other hand, ignored the market's demand and produced a \nplane that few people wanted, and now they are being punished by the \nmarketplace for their mistakes. But rather than take their lumps, they \nare likely to seek an illegal government bailout that would negate the \nhard work and sacrifice of Boeing employees.\n  Recently, an EADS spokesman called launch aid ``indispensable'' and \nsaid, ``Launch aid is the only available system right now'' to deal \nwith Airbus's floundering market and design problems. How can aerospace \nworkers in America compete with a competitor that never has to face the \nconsequences for its failures?\n  Last week, President Bush met with EU leaders at a summit. Before his \ntrip, I wrote to the President and urged him to raise the issue with \nEuropean leaders. Time is running out. We are quickly approaching the \nFarnborough Airshow on July 17 when European Ministers are expected to \ndecide whether to provide EADS with more launch aid.\n  I have supported this administration's willingness to go the distance \nat the World Trade Organization in its fight for fair markets. They \nstood up\n\n[[Page S6501]]\n\nfor American aerospace workers after it became clear that negotiations \nwith the Europeans were going nowhere. As a result, the WTO is now \nconsidering the subsidies case through its dispute settlement body.\n  The Senate is on record against Airbus subsidies. On April 11, 2005, \nthe Senate unanimously passed S. Con. Res. 25. That is a resolution \nwhich called for European governments to reject launch aid for the A350 \nand for President Bush to take any action that he ``considers \nappropriate to protect the interests of the United States in fair \ncompetition in the large commercial aircraft market.'' The resolution \nalso specifically encouraged the U.S. Trade Representative to file a \nWTO case unless the EU eliminates launch aid for the A350 and all \nfuture models.\n  The production of large civilian aircraft is now a mature industry in \nboth the United States and Europe. It is now time that market forces--\nmarket forces, not government aid--determine the future course of this \nindustry.\n  That crossroad I mentioned is coming up on us quickly. One road will \nleave American workers in a fight for their jobs, with the game stacked \nagainst them. The other road will give us a fair playing field where \nAmerican workers can win through their hard work and American \ningenuity. I hope for our country's future that we choose the right \ncourse, and it begins by sending a clear message from our government to \nEurope that the United States will not tolerate another round of \nillegal subsidies that kill American jobs. The clock is running, and \nthe choice is ours.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to a \nconstitutional amendment that would ban flag burning and other acts of \ndesecration.\n  As I said during the recent debate on the Federal marriage amendment, \nI am very troubled by priorities put forth by the Senate majority. Our \ndomestic programs are facing serious budget cuts. Millions of Americans \nare without health insurance. Gas prices are out of control while our \nNation's reliance on foreign oil shows no sign of easing. And we still \nhave no strategy for the war in Iraq. However, the Senate leadership \nhas chosen to spend a portion of our limited days in session to bring \nup a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning.\n  Once again, we seem to be searching for a solution in need of a \nproblem, and I am afraid the reason we are spending time on this topic \nis only for political gain.\n  As a veteran with 30 years in the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Naval \nReserve, I know the pride that members of our Armed Forces feel when \nthey see our flag, wherever they may be in the world. I share the great \nrespect that Vermonters and Americans have for that symbol. I \npersonally detest the notion that anyone would choose to burn a flag as \na form of self-expression.\n  Members of the military put their lives on the line every day to \ndefend the rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. It is \ndisrespectful of these sacrifices to desecrate the flag.\n  However, in my opinion, our commitment to free speech must be strong \nenough to protect the rights of those who express unpopular ideas or \nwho choose such a distasteful means of expression. This concept is at \nthe core of what we stand for as Americans.\n  Mr. President, I have given this constitutional amendment a great \ndeal of thought. I must continue to oppose this amendment because I do \nnot think we should amend the Bill of Rights unless our basic values as \na nation are seriously threatened. In my view, a few incidents of flag \nburning, as upsetting as they may be, do not meet this high standard.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding we are in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. But that it would be acceptable for me to speak on \nthe pending business, which is the flag amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/27/senate-section/article/S6501-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6501-S6503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FLAG PROTECTION AMENDMENT\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise as the main Democratic sponsor \nof this amendment. I have given this a lot of thought for a long time. \nI believe what we have before us is language that is essentially \ncontent neutral. It is on conduct--not speech. I will make that \nargument later on in my remarks, but I begin my remarks with how I came \nto believe that the American flag is something very special.\n  For those of us who are westerners, the Pacific battles of World War \nII had very special significance.\n  Reporters were not embedded, there was no television coverage, and \nthe war in the Pacific was terrible--island battle after island \nbattle--the death march at Guadalcanal, Tarawa, and onward.\n  On the morning of February 24, 1945, I was a 12-year-old. I picked up \na copy of the San Francisco Chronicle. There on the cover was the now \niconic photograph done by a Chronicle photographer by the name of Joe \nRosenthal, and it was a photograph of U.S. marines struggling to raise \nOld Glory on a promontory, a rocky promontory above Iwo Jima.\n  For me--at that time as a 12-year-old--and for the Nation, the photo \nwas a bolt of electricity that boosted morale amidst the brutal \nsuffering of the Pacific campaign.\n  The war was based on such solid ground and victory was so hard-\npressed that when the flag unfurled on the rocky promontory on Iwo \nJima, its symbolism of everything courageous about my country was \netched into my mind for all time. This photo cemented my views of the \nflag for all time.\n  In a sense, our flag is the physical fabric of our society, knitting \ntogether disparate peoples from distant lands, uniting us in a common \nbond, not just of individual liberty but also of responsibility to one \nanother.\n  Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter called the flag ``The symbol \nof our national life.'' I, too, have always looked at the flag as the \nsymbol of our democracy, our shared values, our commitment to justice, \nour remembrance to those who have sacrificed to defend these \nprinciples.\n  For our veterans, the flag represents the democracy and freedom they \nfought so hard to protect. Today there are almost 300,000 troops \nserving overseas, putting their lives on the line every day to fight \nfor the fundamental principles that our flag symbolizes.\n  The flag's design carries our history. My proudest possession is a \n13-star flag. When you look at this flag, now faded and worn, you see \nthe detail of the 200-year-old hand stitching--and the significance of \nevery star and stripe.\n  The colors were chosen at the Second Continental Congress in 1777. We \nall know them well: Red for heartiness and courage; white for purity \nand innocence; blue for vigilance, perseverance, and justice. Even the \nnumber of stripes has meaning--13 for 13 colonies.\n  Our flag is unique not only in the hearts and minds of Americans, but \nin our laws and customs as well. No other emblem or symbol in our \nNation carries with it such a specific code of conduct and protocol in \nits display and handling.\n  For example, Federal law specifically directs that the flag should \nnever be displayed with its union down, except as a signal of dire \ndistress or in instances of extreme danger to life or property.\n  The U.S. flag should never touch anything beneath it: neither ground, \nfloor,\n\n[[Page S6502]]\n\nwater, or merchandise. The flag must be lit at night. It should never \nbe dipped to any person or thing. And the flag should never be carried \nhorizontally but should always be carried aloft and free.\n  The flag flies over our government buildings throughout the country. \nIt flies over our embassies abroad, a silent but strong reminder that \nwhen in those buildings, one is on American soil and afforded all the \nprotections and liberties enjoyed back home.\n  Last December, I traveled to Iraq and met with some of the brave men \nand women in the armed forces that are serving there. We flew out of \nBaghdad on a C-130 that we shared with a flag-draped coffin accompanied \nby a military escort.\n  The young man or woman in that coffin gave their life under the \nbanner of this flag.\n  In 1974, Justice Byron White wrote that:\n\n       It is well within the powers of Congress to adopt and \n     prescribe a national flag and to protect the unity of that \n     flag. . . . [T]he flag is an important symbol of nationhood \n     and unity, created by the Nation and endowed with certain \n     attributes.\n\n  Justice White continued:\n\n       [T]here would seem to be little question about the power of \n     Congress to forbid the mutilation of the Lincoln Memorial or \n     to prevent overlaying it with words or other objects. The \n     flag is itself a monument, subject to similar protection.\n\n  I echo the opinion of Justice White: ``The flag is itself a monument, \nsubject to similar protection.''\n  The American flag is our monument in cloth.\n  The flag flying over our Capitol building today, the flag flying over \nmy home here and in San Francisco, each of these flags, separated by \ndistance but not symbolic value, is its own monument to everything \nAmerica represents. And it should be protected as such.\n  There is a sturdy historical and legal foundation for special \nprotection for the flag. Constitutional scholars as diverse as Chief \nJustices William Rehnquist and Earl Warren and Associate Justices \nStevens and Hugo Black have vouched for the unique status of the \nnational flag.\n  On June 14, 1777, the Continental Congress passed the first Flag Act:\n\n       Resolved, That the flag of the United States be made of \n     thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be \n     thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new \n     Constellation.\n\n  Historically, the flag has been protected by statute. In 1989, 48 of \nour 50 States had statutes restricting flag desecration. However, that \nprotection ended in 1989.\n  That year the Supreme Court, by a vote of 5 to 4, struck down a Texas \nState law prohibiting the desecration of American flags in a manner \nthat would be offensive to others in the Texas v. Johnson case.\n  Although the Court held that the government has ``a legitimate \ninterest in making efforts to `preserv[e] the national flag as an \nunalloyed symbol of our country,' '' it nevertheless concluded that \nburning the flag constituted speech under the first amendment, and that \nthe Texas statute outlawing flag desecration was an impermissible \nregulation of the content of a person's speech.\n  Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in his dissent in \nJohnson that the flag is:\n\n       a symbol of our freedom, of equal opportunity, of religious \n     tolerance, and of good will for other peoples who share our \n     aspirations.\n\n  I agree with Justice Stevens.\n  In response to the Johnson case, Congress passed the Flag Protection \nAct of 1989, which sought to ban flag desecration in a ``content-\nneutral'' way that would be permitted by the courts. Nevertheless, the \nSupreme Court struck down that Federal statute as well.\n  In that case, United States v. Eichman, the Supreme Court, by another \n5-to-4 vote, held that although the Federal statute prohibiting flag \ndesecration did not limit speech based on content, which had been found \nunconstitutional in Johnson, the statute still violated the first \namendment because Congress's intent in passing the statute was \n``related to the suppression of free expression.''\n  The Supreme Court has spoken, and I do not wish to quarrel with its \ndecisions.\n  However, the Johnson and Eichman decisions make it clear that without \na constitutional amendment no Federal statute protecting the flag will \nsurvive judicial review.\n  Consequently, the only avenue available for restoring protection to \nthe flag is to amend the Constitution. Otherwise, any legislation \npassed by Congress or State legislatures will simply be struck down.\n  The Constitution itself prescribes instructions for its amendment \nwhen nepessary for the good of the Nation. And the Constitution is, \nafter all, a living text that has been amended 27 times since its \ncreation.\n  I do not take amending the Constitution lightly. It is a serious \nbusiness and we need to tread carefully. However, the change we seek to \nmake is narrow, it is limited, and it is necessary.\n  Some critics say we must choose between trampling on the flag and \ntrampling on the first amendment. I strongly disagree.\n  The freedom of speech enshrined in the first amendment is a \ncornerstone of our great Nation.\n  However, there is no idea or thought expressed by the burning of the \nAmerican flag that cannot be expressed equally well in another manner. \nWhile I might disagree with those who protest, I defend their right to \ndo so.\n  Protecting the flag will not prevent anyone from expressing his or \nher point of view, regardless of what that point of view may be.\n  Indeed, the Supreme Court has recognized many instances in which \nspeech is not protected, such as obscenity and ``fighting words.'' I \nbelieve that desecrating an American flag falls into the same category.\n  Limiting this very specific conduct will leave both the flag and \nspeech safe.\n  Amending the Constitution for this narrow and necessary purpose is an \nimplicit recognition of the depth and breadth of the first amendment. \nWhat could more clearly signal the scope and strength of our freedom of \nspeech than the fact that even protecting our Nation's symbol from \ndesecration requires a constitutional amendment?\n  I would like to assure those with reservations about amending the \nConstitution that the path we are taking is no slippery slope.\n  There will be no stampede of constitutional amendments that could \nerode our freedom of speech. There will be no litany of restrictions.\n  There has been much confusion surrounding this amendment.\n  It does not prohibit flag burning, as is so often stated. This \namendment would, quite simply, enable the Congress--you and I and our \n98 other Members, Mr. President, as well as the 435 Members of the \nHouse of Representatives, and the President of the United States--to \nset the protocols governing our flag and protecting it as it has been \nprotected throughout most of this Nation's history.\n  In other words, we will hold hearings. We will devise legislation. We \nwill debate that legislation on the floor of both bodies. The purpose \nis to enable this body and the other body to establish a protocol for \nthe handling of the American flag. No more, no less. It is content \nneutral. It does not ban desecration, burning, defiling, or anything \nelse.\n  Let me read the text of the amendment:\n\n       The Congress shall have the power to prohibit the physical \n     desecration of the flag of the United States.\n\n  Just as 48 States debated this prior to 1989, and just as 48 States \nmade a decision and passed legislation, the Congress of the United \nStates would now have the power.\n  That is it. No more. No less.\n  The resolution--if passed by three-quarters of the 50 State \nlegislatures--would merely return to Congress its historical power to \nprohibit the physical desecration of the flag.\n  The amendment will enable Congress to have a full and fair debate on \nthe appropriate protections for the flag.\n  As President Woodrow Wilson, who proclaimed the first Flag Day in \n1916, said:\n\n       This flag, which we honor and under which we serve, is the \n     emblem of our unity, our power, our thought and purpose as a \n     nation. It has no other character than that which we give it \n     from generation to generation. . . . Though silent, it speaks \n     to us--speaks to us of the past, of the men and women who \n     went before us, and of the records they wrote upon it.\n  In honor of this emblem of America, I ask that this body permit us to \ngive\n\n[[Page S6503]]\n\nthe American people the opportunity to decide if the Constitution \nshould be amended. It is time to let the people decide.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee).

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S.J. Res. 12, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S.J. Res. 12) proposing an amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States authorizing Congress to \n     prohibit physical desecration of the flag of the United \n     States.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about this \namendment this morning because there seems to be a lot of \nmisunderstanding about it. There are those who believe this amendment \ninterferes with First Amendment rights and privileges. It does not. The \nmedia has largely portrayed this amendment as a ban on flag \ndesecration. It is not. This amendment is, pure and simple, a \nrestoration of the Constitution to what it was before unelected \njurists, in a 5 to 4 decision, changed it. In 1989, five justices ruled \nthat flag desecration, including burning the flag or any number of \nsimilar offensive acts, is speech. Four of them, led by the opinion of \nJustice Stevens, one of the most liberal members of the Court, found \nthat such conduct does not constitute speech.\n  Fifty State legislatures, both red States and blue States, have \ncalled on us to pass this amendment. There are 60 up-front primary \ncosponsors of this amendment. There are at least six others who have \nsaid that they will vote for it. If that is all true, we are 1 vote \nshort of having 67, with just a few who may still be undecided. We are \nhopeful that they will understand that this amendment simply says that \n``Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical desecration of the \nflag of the United States.'' In other words, in passing this amendment, \nwe would give to Congress the power that the Supreme Court took away \nfrom it when they decided the Johnson case in 1989. That is very \nimportant to understand.\n  Today, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator \nSpecter, is holding a hearing on Presidential signing statements, which \nhe and some others believe actually take away power from the Congress \nof the United States.\n  We have heard various Members on both sides of the aisle get up and \nsay that they are tired of the other branches of Government, meaning \nthe executive and judicial branches, taking away powers from the \nCongress. This amendment would restore power to Congress. That is its \nimportance.\n  The amendment does not ban anything. It does not require the creation \nof a statute. It does not say what is and what is not desecration of \nthe flag. That would have to be defined later, assuming that the \nCongress decides, under its own power, through its own Representatives, \nto try to pass a statute that would define physical desecration of the \nflag. And if Congress did, at some point in the future, decide to \nexercise this power, then I believe that the good Members of Congress \nwould very narrowly construe in a statute what is and what is not \ndesecration of the flag.\n  Once again, fifty States, 50 State legislatures, every State in the \nUnion has called for this amendment. Sixty-six Senators, both Democrats \nand Republicans, support this amendment. We are hopeful that there will \nbe one or two others who will vote with us, and I believe if we get \nthat 67th vote we will have 75.\n  In addition, anyone who tries to say that this proposed amendment \ninterferes with First Amendment rights has not read it, as many in the \nmedia have not. This amendment would have no effect on the First \nAmendment. It merely returns the power to protect the flag back to the \nCongress of the United States.\n  In his speech yesterday, Senator Durbin, my dear colleague from \nIllinois, who is the Democratic whip, suggested that this amendment is \nunnecessary. He based his assertion on the supposition that there are \nrelatively few incidents of flag desecration. So why bother, was \nbasically his argument. Why should we address what appears to be a \nmatter of minor significance?\n  I will tell you why. As I stated, this amendment does not ban \nanything. But let me assume, as Senator Durbin did, that it does. Just \none incident, just one, is enough to justify action. One flag burning \nis enough, I think, for most people in this country. Principles are not \ncreatures of convenience, despite assertions to the contrary.\n  As my colleagues know, 48 States, plus the District of Columbia, had \nanti-desecration measures on the books before 1989. It was then that \nfive unelected judges told those 48 sovereign entities that they were \nwrong.\n  Do my colleagues know the basis for the ruling? Five lawyers decided \nthat all of these 48 State legislatures, as well as the District of \nColumbia, were wrong and that their measures were unconstitutional. But \nI ask, where does the Constitution say these measures are \nunconstitutional? Where in the text of the Constitution does it say \nthis? The silence is deafening. We all know the Constitution does not \nsay these measures are unconstitutional. Five lawyers came to this \nconclusion on the basis of a legal seance.\n  Now, I wonder, why did 48 States act in this area if anti-desecration \nlaws are unnecessary? I will tell you why. Incidents of flag \ndesecration are much more frequent than many of my colleagues have \nsuggested.\n  The Citizens' Flag Alliance has been cataloguing reported incidents \nof flag desecration since 1994. Now, these are the incidents that are \nmade public generally in the media. Their list is by no means \ncomprehensive. There are many, many incidents of flag desecration, even \nsome that are extremely offensive or even obscene, that are just not \nreported.\n  I know these people in the Flag Alliance. They are true citizen \nactivists. They do not have high-priced lobbyists and $500-an-hour \nattorneys working for them. Many of them are working individuals who \nare simply committed to the values and ideals the flag represents. \nThese hard-working individuals have devoted their time and energy \nfighting for the right to protect these values.\n  The Citizens' Flag Alliance has kept an eye on the news throughout \nthe country to watch for reports of flag desecration. But with over \n1,450 newspapers in this country it is no small feat to maintain a \ncomprehensive list. Despite the difficulties in tracking these \noccurrences, the information that the Citizens' Flag Alliance has \ngathered appears to counter my colleagues' suggestion that there were \nnot many incidents of flag desecration at all.\n  Since the Citizens' Flag Alliance began keeping count in 1994, there \nhave been over 130 recorded incidents of flag desecration. In small \nrural areas as well as cities like Cincinnati, OH and Washington, DC, \nsome of these people have defiled the very meaning of the flag by \ndesecrating it, and, in many of those cases, more than one flag was \ndesecrated.\n  For example, 10 flags were vandalized at the American Legion building \non the Veterans of Foreign Wars post in New Hampshire just a few months \nago. And, just last week in New York, there was an incident in which \nseven flags displayed on citizens' private property were desecrated and \nburned.\n  These reported occurrences of flag desecration are simply the tip of \nthe iceberg. Besides the difficulties in monitoring the news for flag \ndesecration incidents, there are many other acts of flag desecration \nthat go unreported either because citizens know that the individual \nresponsible cannot be prosecuted thanks to the Supreme Court\n\n[[Page S6504]]\n\ndecisions or because the media just plain doesn't care.\n  I heard the other day that protesters recently desecrated an American \nflag at the funeral of one of our fallen soldiers at Arlington \nCemetery. This is just in the last few weeks. I have yet to see this \nreported by the press.\n  The bottom line is that, while this may not be a common offense, it \nis an ongoing and perpetual offense against common decency. Like I \nsaid, one flag desecration is enough for the majority of people in this \ncountry, let alone hundreds of them.\n  Now, I would add that these counts miss the point. No matter how many \nincidents of flag desecration, the American people, through their \nrepresentatives, should be allowed to pass judgment on this behavior. \nThe courts, including the Supreme Court, used to understand this. They \nused to respect the considered judgment of the people's \nrepresentatives. They understood that the desecration of this unique \nsymbol, our symbol, the flag, had a unique impact on the communities \nthat suffer through these events. The opponents of this constitutional \namendment can only offer an admonition to grin and bear it, suggesting \nthat we should all be bigger people and not worry about those \ndesecrated flags.\n  I do not think my colleagues appreciate the harm done to these \ncommunities when flags are desecrated on our Independence Day, on \nMemorial Day, or on our Veterans Day.\n  The American people do. The American people understand that even one \nsuch event is one too many.\n  Consider these accounts and tell me these communities have not \nsuffered. Let me refer to this chart. This is from the Las Vegas Review \nJournal. It is entitled: ``Misdemeanor Filed in Flag Burning in Las \nVegas,'' dated September 14, 2004.\n\n       [Stephen Drew] Hampton burned a U.S. flag during a tribute \n     to the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks . . . \n     Hampton set fire to a U.S. flag and waved it around before he \n     was ushered out of the event by Las Vegas police and city \n     marshals. Hampton also burned a U.S. flag last year on Sept. \n     11 in front of the New York-New York Hotel & Casino.\n\n  We were not even talking about the flag amendment then. This is \nsimply the way some people handle our flag. This individual is by no \nmeans the only example.\n  The fact is that this is not a partisan issue. The American people \nwant this amendment. This is an issue supported by Democrats, \nIndependents, and Republicans nationwide. This amendment is supported \nin a bipartisan manner by both Democrats and Republicans in the Senate.\n  The problem is not that there is a rash of flag burning, although by \nanybody's count you would have to say there certainly is. This is not \nwhat this resolution is meant to address. Suggesting that we could only \nlegislate to protect against widespread flag desecration is a red \nherring. What we are doing here is restoring the power of the American \npeople over their own communities.\n  Let's be honest about it. This amendment is a very simple amendment. \nIt says nothing about banning flag desecration. It does nothing to the \nFirst Amendment. It simply says we are going to return this issue back \nto the Congress where it should have been to begin with. This amendment \nsays these words:\n\n       The Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical \n     desecration of the flag of the United States.\n\n  Does that mean the Congress has to prohibit desecration of the flag? \nNo. Will the Congress? I hope so. But the Congress does not have to. \nEven if, assuming this amendment is passed by this body and ratified by \n38 States, Congress decides to bring forth a statute, it would still \nhave to have a super-majority vote in the Senate because of those who \nwould be opposed to it, who would filibuster it, and who would require \nus to invoke cloture. Therefore, it would only pass after the whole \nCongress has spent a considerable amount of time figuring out how best \nto define flag desecration.\n  Mr. President, I notice the distinguished Senator from Florida is on \nthe floor and would like to make some remarks, so I will relinquish the \nfloor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, it is a real honor to follow the Senator \nfrom Utah on an issue of constitutionality, where I know he has had a \ngreat impact in the life of our Nation through the distinguished \nhistory he has had as a Senator. I know from his many years of serving \nin the Judiciary Committee that he is one who jealously guards and \nunderstands the importance and the meaning of our Constitution.\n  Mr. President, I wish to speak on this issue of the amendment to \nprotect the flag of the United States, and I wish to begin by speaking \nabout it in a slightly different angle, as someone who, as a young boy \nin school--I think it was when I reached the fifth grade--was charged \nwith the responsibility of raising the flag in the morning and then \nbringing it down and protecting it and moving it into a safe place for \nthe evening, until the next school day. I did that for the entire \nschool year.\n  It was with great reverence and ceremony that this took place. I was, \nI remember, empowered with this responsibility as a young boy, which \nwas one of the first I had, and I took it very seriously. The \ninteresting thing is, it was in another place, in another land, and it \nwas another flag. It was not the flag we honor and revere today, but it \nwas the flag of the country of my birth, Cuba.\n  But what I noticed then and came to notice here is that people place \ngreat importance in symbols of national unity. No matter what country \nor where we are, there are very special symbols that from time to time \ntouch a cord within the nation.\n  No greater evidence of the importance of this symbol can be given \nthan through the history of our country, the stories we have heard and \ncome to know of great heroism in battle, such as that of a soldier, \nperhaps at great risk to his own life, who would go to save the flag, \ngo to save the colors--the symbol of the Nation he was fighting for and \nrepresenting. And many soldiers in the history of our Nation have done \njust that.\n  So it seems almost odd there should be a heated debate. I understand \nthe reason for the debate. It is rooted in the principles of \nconstitutional freedom. It is rooted in the desire to honor those first \n10 amendments to the Constitution, which are really what we call the \nBill of Rights and the right of free speech.\n  But I do recall, early in law school, studying constitutional law, \nlearning that all rights enshrined in the Constitution have certain \nlimits within them, that they all have certain boundaries, that there \nis no such thing as unlimited rights. Although we treasure and value \nour right of free speech, I do believe it is important we understand \nthere are some things that ought to be protected.\n  We protect our national monuments, not just because they are pieces \nof property that are beautiful and what they represent, but it is \nreally more about the symbol of what they are. The national monuments \nare protected because they are a symbol of something special in our \nNation, and it might be a person, it might be a historical moment in \ntime.\n  Likewise, this very special symbol of our Nation, our flag, is one I \nbelieve we should also protect. It is protected in a simple way. It is \nabout the balance of power within our Nation. It is about the \ndifference between those things which are reserved for the judicial \nbranch and others which are placed in the hands of the legislative \nbranch.\n\n  What the Congress seeks to do in proposing this amendment to the \nAmerican people, in placing it in a place where it can now enshrine \nforever what was attempted to be done legislatively a number of times, \nwhich the courts have chosen to strike down, is to say the legislative \nbranch of Government, that branch closest to the people, elected by the \npeople, shall have the right and the power to prohibit the physical \ndesecration of the flag of the United States. That is what the article \nwould say:\n\n       The Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical \n     desecration of the flag of the United States.\n\n  When I was young, another life experience, now being shared by my \nyoungest son, was being a Boy Scout. We see Boy Scouts through the \nhalls of our Congress, visiting here, seeing our sacred monuments, \nseeing our places where this Republic has been a beacon of hope, the \n``shining city on a hill'' to\n\n[[Page S6505]]\n\nmany people around the world. When they come and relish what they see, \nthey come with a certain pride. They have learned also, as young boys, \nto protect the flag, to defend the flag, to honor the flag, and to \ntreat it with that very special respect which is expected for something \nas important as a symbol of national unity.\n  So I am an encouraged supporter of this amendment because I believe \nit is important that as our Nation goes forward we always respect and \nhonor the opportunity and the right of those who disagree with the \npolicies of our Government to freely express themselves, to have no \nplace where they cannot speak. I understand the meaning of freedom, the \nmeaning of the right of free speech. However, I do also understand the \nvery special nature of what the flag represents. In that situation, I \nbelieve there are many opportunities available to those who wish to \nprotest, to those who wish to express a point of view different from \nthe Government, that can be expressed in ways that do not afront, that \ndo not offend, and do not destroy that very important symbol of \nnational unity which we have made our flag and which our flag has been.\n  So I am proud today to support this amendment. I believe it is \nimportant that it be a constitutional amendment because we know that \npast efforts to legislatively fix the problem--to legislatively say to \nall that this symbol of national unity is so important that we deem it \nimportant enough to protect in a very special way--have been frustrated \nby the inability of the courts to agree with a clear direction the \nlegislative branch has imposed on this. So then it is upon us to allow \nthe people of this country to vote on this issue and to allow the \nvarious State legislative bodies to move on this issue and to seek to \npreserve for evermore this symbol of national unity.\n  This amendment seeks to prevent the physical abuse of a symbol that \nhas served our country in many valuable ways through its history. It \ndoes not do so by restricting anyone's speech but by addressing their \nphysical conduct. We are a free and vibrant people, and we owe that to \nthose who have gone before us, and to those who serve us now, in \nprotecting our national interests. Desecrating the flag does nothing to \ncelebrate or enhance our expressive freedoms, while it clearly \ndishonors those who have seen the flag as a basis for their service and \nsacrifice.\n  So I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment and \nprotect the most prominent and visible symbol of the freedom that \nAmerica represents to the world.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I strongly oppose S.J. Res. 12. Make no \nmistake, we are talking here today about modifying the Constitution of \nthe United States to permit the Government to criminalize conduct that \nall of us find offensive and wrong, but that is protected by the first \namendment. This amendment would, for the first time, amend the Bill of \nRights. I cannot support this course.\n  Let me make one thing clear at the outset. Not a single Senator who \nopposes the proposed constitutional amendment, as I do, supports \nburning or otherwise showing disrespect to the flag. Not a single one. \nNone of us think it is ``OK'' to burn the flag. None of us view the \nflag as ``just a piece of cloth.'' On those rare occasions when some \nmalcontent defiles or burns our flag, I join everyone in this Chamber \nin condemning that action.\n  But we must also defend the right of all Americans to express their \nviews about their Government, however hateful or spiteful or \ndisrespectful those views may be, without fear of their Government \nputting them in jail for those views. America is not simply a Nation of \nsymbols, it is a Nation of principles. And the most important principle \nof all, the principle that has made this country a beacon of hope and \ninspiration for oppressed peoples throughout the world, is the right of \nfree expression. This amendment threatens that right, so I must oppose \nit.\n  We have heard at various times over the years that this amendment has \nbeen debated that permitting protestors to burn the American flag sends \nthe wrong message to our children about patriotism and respect for our \ncountry. I couldn't disagree more with that argument. We can send no \nbetter, no stronger, no more meaningful message to our children about \nthe principles and the values of this country than if we oppose efforts \nto undermine freedom of expression, even expression that is undeniably \noffensive. When we uphold first amendment freedoms despite the efforts \nof misguided and despicable people who want to provoke our wrath, we \nexplain what America is really about. Our country and our people are \nfar too strong to be threatened by those who burn the flag. That is a \nlesson we should proudly teach our children.\n  Amending the first amendment so we can bring the full reach of the \ncriminal law and the power of the state down on political dissenters \nwill only encourage more people who want to grandstand their dissent \nand imagine themselves ``martyrs for the cause.'' Indeed, we all know \nwhat will happen the minute this amendment goes into force--more flag \nburnings and other outrageous acts of disrespect of the flag, not \nfewer. Will the amendment make these acts any more despicable than they \nare now? Certainly not. Will it make us love the flag any more than we \ndo today? Absolutely not.\n  It has been almost exactly 17 years since the Supreme Court ruled \nthat flag burning is a form of political speech protected by the first \namendment. Proposals to amend the Constitution arose almost immediately \nand have continued unabated. But while the interest of politicians in \nthis course of action seems as strong as ever, public interest in it \nseems to be waning. Opinion polls show support for the amendment has \nfallen. Amending the Constitution to prohibit flag desecration is just \nnot the foremost thing on the minds of the American people. Perhaps \nthat is because it is long since clear that our Republic can survive \nquite well without this amendment. Nearly a generation has passed since \nthe Texas v. Johnson decision, and our Nation is still standing strong. \nThat alone shows that this amendment is a huge overreaction and an \nentirely unnecessary step.\n  The last time that the full Senate voted on, and rejected, this \nconstitutional amendment was in the year 2000. I think it is fair to \nsay that patriotism since then has not only survived without this \namendment, it has flourished, and in very difficult times, much more \ndifficult than the country faced in 1989, when the Supreme Court struck \ndown flag desecration statutes, or in 1995 when I first voted on the \namendment in the Judiciary Committee.\n  Indeed, outward displays of patriotism are greater today than they \nwere in 2000. We all know why that is. Our country was viciously attack \non September 11, 2001, and America responded.\n  We didn't need a constitutional amendment to teach Americans how to \nlove their country. They showed us how to do it by entering burning \nbuildings to save their fellow citizens who were in danger, by standing \nin line for hours to give blood, by driving hundreds of miles to search \nthrough the rubble for survivors and to help in cleanup efforts, by \npraying in their houses of worship for the victims of the attacks and \ntheir families.\n\n  September 11 inspired our citizens to perform some of the most \nselfless acts of bravery and patriotism we have seen in our entire \nhistory. No constitutional amendment could ever match those acts as a \ndemonstration of patriotism, or create similar acts in the future. We \ndo not need a constitutional amendment to teach Americans how to love \ntheir country or how to defend it from our enemies.\n  I know that many veterans fervently support this amendment. I deeply \nrespect their opinions and their right to urge the Congress to pass it. \nBut I also want the record to be clear that many of those who have \nserved our country in battle oppose the amendment as well. In 1999, a \nnumber of veterans formed a group called the Veterans Defending the \nBill of Rights. These veterans, who served our country in five\n\n[[Page S6506]]\n\ndifferent wars, strongly believe it is wrong to pass an amendment to \nprotect the flag that takes away the freedom the flag represents. I'd \nlike to share with my colleagues the views of these brave veterans, \nwho, in my opinion, represent the very best of the American spirit.\n  Let me start with the words of a veteran of our current conflict in \nIraq. SPC Eric Eliason of Englewood, CO, served as an infantryman in \nthe Army for 3 years, including 1 year overseas as part of Operation \nIraqi Freedom. He said:\n\n       We volunteered to go to war to protect the freedoms in this \n     country, not watch them be taken away. . . . I consider \n     myself an independent-minded conservative, and believe that \n     creating unnecessary amendments to the U.S. Constitution is a \n     betrayal of conservative principles.\n\n  Another veteran, Brady Bustany of West Hollywood, CA, who served in \nthe Air Force during the gulf war, put it very simply. He said,\n\n       My military service was not about protecting the flag; it \n     was about protecting the freedoms behind it. The flag \n     amendment curtails free speech and expression in a way that \n     should frighten us all.\n\n  A veteran of the Korean war, Jack Heyman of Fort Myers Beach, FL, \nwhose great grandfather fought in the Civil War, whose father served in \nWorld War I, and whose son served in Vietnam, explained his opposition \nto the amendment this way:\n\n       I know of no American veteran who put his or her life on \n     the line to protect the sanctity of the flag. That was not \n     why we fulfilled our patriotic duty. We did so and still do \n     to protect our country and our way of life and to ensure that \n     our children enjoy the same freedoms for which we fought.\n\n  The leader of Veterans Defending the Bill of Rights is Professor Gary \nMay of the University of Southern Indiana. Professor May, whose father, \nfather-in-law, grandfather, and brother also served our country in the \nArmed Forces, lost both legs in the Vietnam War on April 12, 1968, over \n38 years ago. He opposes this amendment, and because of what he has \nsacrificed for his country, he speaks more eloquently than I could ever \nhope to about the danger of this amendment. Professor May testified at \nthe last Senate hearing held on the flag amendment, which, by the way, \nwas held more than 2 years ago, on March 10, 2004. Professor May said:\n\n       Freedom is what makes the United States of America strong \n     and great, and freedom, including the right to dissent, is \n     what has kept our democracy going for more than 200 years. \n     And it is freedom that will continue to keep it strong for my \n     children and the children of all the people like my father, \n     late father in law, grandfather, brother, me, and others like \n     us who served honorably and proudly for freedom.\n       The pride and honor we feel is not in the flag per see It \n     is in the principles for which it stands and the people who \n     have defended them. My pride and admiration is in our \n     country, its people and its fundamental principles. I am \n     grateful for the many heroes of our country--and especially \n     those in my family. All the sacrifices of those who went \n     before me would be for naught, if an amendment were added to \n     the Constitution that cut back on our First Amendment rights \n     for the first time in the history of our great Nation.\n\n  Professor May also provided in his statement excerpts from letters he \nhas received from other veterans who oppose the amendment.\n  One veteran, James Lubbock of St. Louis, MO, who served in World War \nII and has two sons who served in the Vietnam war, said:\n\n       Let's not alter the Bill of Rights to save the flag. We \n     should respect the flag, but we should all cherish the Bill \n     of Rights much, much more.\n\n  These kinds of expressions move me deeply. The service of our troops \nshows the awesome power of the American ideal. The willingness of our \nyoung people to serve this country, to risk their lives, and endure \nunimaginable hardships on our behalf is not to be taken lightly. I \nbelieve that this remarkable spirit is inspired and nurtured by the \nprinciples on which this country was founded, by our devotion to the \nConstitution and the rule of law. We should not trifle with those \nprinciples. Too much is at stake. We know that now more than ever.\n  Despite the expected close vote, it is clear that this is a political \nexercise in an election year. We will spend several days of precious \nfloor time, as the legislative session winds down, debating a measure \nthat would undermine the Constitution while affecting only a handful of \nmiscreants each year.\n  As we do so, humanitarian catastrophes continue to unfold around the \nworld, posing a direct threat to international peace and stability and \naffecting the lives of millions upon millions of people.\n  I sincerely hope we will remember what this debate today is really \nabout--not whether flag burning is a good idea, not whether we love and \nrespect our flag, not whether patriotism is worth encouraging and \ncelebrating, but whether the threat to our country from those who burn \nthe flag is so great--is so great--that we must sacrifice the power and \nthe majesty of the first amendment to the Constitution in order to \nprosecute them.\n  In 1999--it just so happens the Presiding Officer is the son of this \nman--the late Senator John Chafee, one of this country's great war \nheroes at Guadalcanal and in the Korean war, testified before the \nJudiciary Committee against this amendment. He said:\n\n       [W]e cannot mandate respect and pride in the flag. In fact \n     . . . taking steps to require citizens to respect the flag, \n     sullies its significance and symbolism.\n\n  Senator Chafee's words still echo in my mind. They should serve as a \ncaution to all of us who have the responsibility to vote on this \namendment. What kind of symbol of freedom and liberty will our flag be \nif it has to be protected from misguided protesters by a constitutional \namendment?\n  In concluding, Mr. President, I pay tribute to you and your father. I \nwill vote to defend our Constitution against this ill-advised effort to \namend it. I urge my colleagues to vote for liberty and freedom and for \nthe first amendment by voting no on this constitutional amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that several letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         American Bar Association,\n\n\n                                  Governmental Affairs Office,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 9, 2006.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: On behalf of the American Bar \n     Association, I write to urge you to vote against S.J. Res. \n     12, the proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution that \n     would allow Congress to prohibit the physical desecration of \n     the flag of the United States.\n       Few things are more offensive to most Americans than the \n     desecration of our flag. But, as important as the flag is to \n     all of us, we must never protect it at the expense of the \n     constitionally protected freedoms it symbolizes. One of our \n     most precious rights is the right to express our \n     dissatisfaction with our government through peaceful words or \n     conduct, both of which are forms of political speech and \n     protected under the First Amendment, S.J. Res. 12 would \n     enshrine a restriction on our fundamental right to free \n     speech in the very document that protects our individual \n     liberties. For the first time in our Nation's history a \n     fundamental right would be denied for future generations.\n       The Bill of Rights has remained honored and intact, even \n     during great times of conflict and stress for our nation, for \n     over 200 years. As James Madison once stated, amending the \n     Constitution should he reserved for ``great and extraordinary \n     occasions.'' Infrequent incidents of flag desecration do not \n     warrant undermining the freedom of speech guaranteed under \n     the First Amendment. If we were to desecrate our Constitution \n     to protect the flag's cloth from insult, we would do it great \n     disservice to both.\n       All through human history, tyrannies have tried to enforce \n     obedience by prohibiting disrespect for the symbols of their \n     power. The American flag commands respect and love because of \n     our country's adherence to its values and promise of freedom, \n     not because of fiat and criminal law. America is not so \n     fragile and our citizens' patriotism is not so superficial \n     that they must be upheld by the mandate of a constitutional \n     amendment to protect the flag.\n       We urge you to defend and preserve our cherished \n     constitutional freedoms by rejecting S.J. Res. 12.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael S. Greco.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Veterans for Common Sense,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 14, 2005.\n     Re Oppose the Flag Desecration Constitutional Amendment.\n\n       Dear Senator: We, the undersigned members of Veterans for \n     Common Sense, write to urge you to oppose S.J. Res. 12, the \n     proposed constitutional amendment to prohibit ``desecration'' \n     of the flag. This proposed amendment is an attack on liberty, \n     and a disturbing distraction from the real concerns of our \n     nation's veterans.\n       Veterans for Common Sense (VCS) was founded on the \n     principle that in an age when\n\n[[Page S6507]]\n\n     the majority of public servants have never served in uniform, \n     the perspective of war veterans must play a key role in the \n     public debate over national security issues in order to \n     preserve the liberty veterans have fought and died to \n     protect. VCS was formed in 2002 by war veterans who believe \n     that we, the people of the United States of America, are most \n     secure when our country is strong and responsibly engaged \n     with the world. Three years later, our organization has over \n     12,000 members throughout the United States. Central to our \n     mission is supporting United States servicemen and women, \n     veterans and their families, and preserving American civil \n     liberties as guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution and its \n     amendments.\n       The United States is faced with a number of pressing \n     concerns related to national security and the quality of life \n     of veterans. We believe that the United States government and \n     military has a responsibility to maintain and continue its \n     work in Iraq so that the country comes out of this war as a \n     stable, secure and sovereign nation where its people have the \n     best opportunity for a decent and free life. The government \n     also has a responsibility to ensure that United States \n     servicemen and women come home safe.\n       Out of the 360,000 discharged veterans from Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, nearly one in four \n     have already visited the Veterans Administration for physical \n     injuries or mental health counseling. Our government has a \n     duty and a responsibility to address both the traditional and \n     nontraditional effects of war, including battlefield \n     injuries, post-traumatic stress, and diseases resulting from \n     vaccines and toxic exposures.\n       These concerns should be on the top of the congressional \n     agenda this session. But instead of devoting its time and \n     resources to resolving these urgent challenges, Congress \n     apparently chooses to consider amending the Constitution to \n     prohibit a form of nonviolent expression. We are dismayed by \n     this choice.\n       We urge Congress to preserve American civil liberties as \n     guaranteed in the United States Constitution and its \n     amendments. When it comes to the measure under consideration, \n     we believe that the supposed threat of a few incidents of \n     flag burning does not justify the first ever amendment to the \n     First Amendment. The ability to express nonviolent dissent to \n     government policy is central to the American way of life, and \n     we are loathe to amend away this fundamental liberty.\n       As veterans, we are indeed offended by those who burn or \n     defile the flag. The flag is a cherished symbol of the \n     freedoms we fought to defend, and we honor it as such. But we \n     must not attempt to protect this symbol at a cost to the \n     freedoms it represents. The Constitution of the United States \n     has never been successfully amended to restrict liberty. To \n     do so now would betray the promise and ideal of America.\n       The proposed constitutional amendment to ban \n     ``desecration'' of the flag threatens the civil liberties of \n     Americans. Further, it distracts from the real world concerns \n     of our active duty military personnel and veterans. Congress \n     should not be in the business of undermining freedom of \n     speech. During this time of war, we urge you to put this \n     unnecessary and dangerous constitutional amendment aside, and \n     instead focus on protecting our national security, insuring \n     our servicemembers in harm's way have what they need to \n     accomplish the mission, and that when they return home they \n     get the best possible care. Again, please oppose S.J. Res. \n     12. If passed, it will undermine the Constitution that we \n     swore to support and defend.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           BG (Ret.) Evelyn Foote,\n     Army, Accokeek, MD and over 1300 veterans.\n                                  ____\n\n         The American Jewish Committee, Office of Government and \n           International Affairs,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 22, 2006.\n     Re: Flag Desecration Amendment (S.J. Res. 12)\n\n       Dear Senator, On behalf of the American Jewish Committee, \n     the nation's oldest human relations organization with over \n     150,000 members and supporters represented by 33 regional \n     offices nationwide, I urge you to oppose !he Flag Desecration \n     Amendment (S.J. Res. 12). This amendment to the United States \n     Constitution would authorize Congress to prohibit the \n     physical desecration of the U.S. flag.\n       The Flag Desecration Amendment would encroach upon \n     Americans' First Amendment rights. While AJC would be \n     appalled by the burning of the flag for political purposes. \n     the amendment would undermine the very values of freedom of \n     expression and peaceful dissent that our flag represents. The \n     House of Representatives already passed its version or The \n     Flag Desecration Amendment one year ago. If adopted by the \n     Senate. this legislation would mark the first time Congress \n     has amended our founding charter to diminish the precious \n     freedoms protected by the Bill of Rights,\n       We therefore urge you to protect the First Amendment's \n     guarantee of freedom of expression by opposing S.J. Res. 12.\n       Thank you for considering our view on this matter.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                Richard T. Foltin,\n     Legislative Director and Counsel.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               National Council of\n\n\n                                                 Jewish Women,\n\n                                                    June 23, 2006.\n       Dear Senator: I am writing on behalf of the 90,000 members \n     and supporters of the National Council of Jewish Women (NCJW) \n     in opposition to the proposed amendment to the Constitution \n     banning flag desecration (S.J. Res. 12).\n       NCJW is a volunteer organization, inspired by Jewish \n     values, that works to improve the quality of life for women, \n     children, and families and to ensure individual rights and \n     freedoms for all. As such, we feel amending the Constitution \n     in this way would threaten healthy civic debate, personal \n     freedom of expression, and our fundamental democratic values.\n       As a symbol of our nation, the United States' flag \n     represents our unique democracy and basic freedoms. The \n     burning of the American flag constitutes dissenting \n     expressive conduct, a right upheld by the US Supreme Court in \n     Texas v. Johnson (1989). This Supreme Court precedent and our \n     nation's history teach us that we must not protect this \n     symbol at the expense of weakening the rights it represents.\n       As a senator, you are entrusted with protecting the rights \n     and liberties of all Americans. I ask you to reaffirm your \n     commitment to protecting these rights by opposing this \n     egregious amendment.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                   Phyllis Snyder,\n                                                   NCJW President.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, like each of our colleagues in the Senate, \nI have a deep and abiding reverence for our flag.\n  As an 11-year-old Boy Scout, I learned flag etiquette and how we are \nsupposed to show our respect for the flag. Later, I attended Ohio State \nUniversity as a Navy ROTC midshipman and upon graduation took an oath \nto defend our country and its Constitution against all enemies both \nforeign and domestic.\n  I went on to serve our Nation as a naval flight officer for 23 years \nof Active and Reserve duty during the Vietnam war and until the end of \nthe Cold War, much of it as a Navy P-3 mission commander.\n  We fly ``Old Glory'' on the front porch of our home throughout the \nyear. We display it proudly in my Senate offices in Georgetown, Dover, \nand Wilmington, DE, as well as right here in Washington, DC.\n  Over the past 24 years, I have kicked off hundreds of townhall \nmeetings by inviting attendees to stand and join me in pledging \nallegiance to our flag.\n  I wear an American flag lapel pin to work every day, and the American \nflag is even displayed on the Chrysler minivan I drive all over my \nlittle State.\n  I know it may sound old-fashioned or even corny to some, but I still \nget a lump in my throat more often than not when I pledge allegiance to \nour flag or sing our national anthem. In short, I love our flag and all \nof the good that it symbolizes about America.\n  In fact, I probably love our flag more today than all the days I have \nlived on this Earth. That is 59. But as much as I love our flag, I love \nour Constitution even more.\n  The U.S. Constitution is the foundation of the longest living \nexperiment in democracy in the history of the world--America. Although \nwritten by man, I believe our Constitution was divinely inspired.\n  Among the rights that it guarantees us as Americans, none is more \ncherished than our right to freely express our beliefs. As much as we \nmay disagree with the views of others, our Constitution seeks to \nguarantee that each of us has the right to convey our thoughts and \nviews, however outrageous the rest of us may find them to be.\n  Our Constitution has been amended only 17 times since 1791 and just 6 \ntimes in my lifetime.\n  We have amended the Constitution to protect our freedom of speech, to \nworship God as we see fit, to protect our right to bear arms, and to \nensure the right to a trial by a jury of our peers.\n  We have amended our Constitution to protect us from unlawful searches \nof our home and to guarantee our right to\n\n[[Page S6508]]\n\nassemble to present our grievances to those who serve us.\n  Constitutional amendments have abolished slavery, provided women and \n18-year-old Americans with the right to vote, and limited our \nPresidents to serving just two terms in office.\n  The original Framers of our Constitution made it possible to amend \nthe Constitution, but they did not make it easy. Our Founding Fathers \nbelieved they largely ``got it right'' the first time. History has \ndemonstrated that they did.\n  When I served in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam war, flag burning \nwas not uncommon. I was never in the presence of anyone who desecrated \nor destroyed our flag in protests then. It is hard to know for sure how \nI would have reacted, but it would not have been pretty.\n  Having said that, it has been a long time since I ever saw anyone \nburning or otherwise seeking to desecrate or destroy an American flag, \nand I am not the only one who feels that way either.\n  Former Secretary of State Colin Powell wrote several years ago:\n\n       If someone destroys or desecrates a flag that is the \n     property of someone else, that is a prosecutable crime. If \n     someone is foolish enough to desecrate a flag that is their \n     own property, do we really want to amend the Constitution to \n     hammer a handful of miscreants?\n\n  In 1998, retired Green Beret Marvin Stenhammar testified before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee and addressed the two same questions above \nwith this statement:\n\n       As a true conservative, I ask you: When did it become \n     conservative to recommend several changes to the \n     Constitution? My brand of conservatism does not include this \n     doctrine . . . I feel you--\n\n  ``You'' being the Congress--\n\n     have better things to do with your time and our tax dollars \n     than changing the Constitution for something that rarely \n     occurs and is typically done by immature idiots.\n\n  sI have given this issue a lot of thought over the past 30 years. I \nhave searched my heart, and I have concluded that once we let our \npassions subside, Colin Powell and Marvin Stenhammar have spoken the \ntruth.\n  Flag burning or desecration, as we think of it, rarely does occur in \nthis country today. In fact, last night, I was watching the news on \ntelevision with my youngest son. The footage the networks were showing \neither dated back to the Vietnam war or they were images of foreigners \nburning a flag in Iraq or some other foreign countries.\n  I think that begs the question: Do we really need to amend the \nConstitution in an effort to eliminate a form of protest that almost \nnever happens in America today? I am not convinced that we do.\n  Come to think of it, I don't recall a time in my life when there was \na greater reverence for the American flag than there is today in our \ncountry.\n  I was reminded of that fact just last summer when I marched in Fourth \nof July parades throughout Delaware in places such as Hockessin, \nSmyrna, Laurel, and Bethany Beach and saw literally thousands of people \nof all ages waving, wearing, or displaying the stars and stripes.\n  All across America today, we see our flag proudly displayed on \nmillions of homes, office buildings, factories, schools, stadiums, \nconstruction sites, bridges, and on the vehicles we drive.\n  A spirit of patriotism swept across our country since 9/11 in a way I \nhave never witnessed in my life, and it has never fully subsided. That \nspirit is a source of comfort and inspiration to me, as I believe it is \nto millions of Americans everywhere.\n  The ``miscreants'' or the ``idiots'' who used to burn flags here did \nso to bring attention to their causes. They wanted to inflame passions \nin order to garner broader media coverage for those causes.\n  A Washington Post editorial of June 27, 2005--1 year ago today--said \nit better than I could. It said:\n\n       When was the last time you saw someone burning a flag? If \n     the answer is never, that's because it hardly ever happens. \n     In fact, one of the few certain consequences of passing this \n     amendment would be to make flag burning a more fashionable \n     form of protest.\n\n  Given human nature today, the Post is probably right.\n  Another problem with the amendment is that just as beauty is in the \neye of the beholder, so is flag desecration in several respects.\n  Most Americans would agree with us that burning an American flag in \nprotest constitutes desecration, but how about a person covered with \nsuntan lotion and perspiration lying on the sand on a hot sunny day at \nBethany Beach or any beach for hours on an American flag beach towel? \nOr how about wearing an American flag swimsuit? What if a person wears \nAmerican flag underwear, a neckerchief, or a sweatband of the stars and \nstripes?\n  What if they use their American flag neckerchief to wipe the dirt off \ntheir face or maybe even blow their nose on it? Do we really want to \ncause law enforcement officers, along with judges and prosecutors, to \nwrestle with questions such as these or do we want them fighting \nillegal drug trafficking, unlawful immigration, child abuse, assaults, \nrapes, and murders, and other serious crimes that are far more \ncommonplace?\n  Let me suggest to my colleagues today not all behavior that dishonors \nour flag involves the physical desecration. I believe we desecrate our \nflag and what it symbolizes when we send American troops off to war \nwithout the body armor that they and their Humvees are supposed to \nhave. I believe that we desecrate our flag and what it symbolizes if we \ndon't provide for the needs of our soldiers when they come up with \npost-traumatic stress disorder, or without an arm, a leg, or their \neyesight.\n  I believe we desecrate what our flag symbolizes when we discourage \nhundreds of thousands of Americans from voting by knowingly \nmisallocating voting machines in some parts of America, causing people \nto give up after waiting for hours in line to cast their ballots.\n  I believe we desecrate what our flag symbolizes when we intimidate \npeople whose religious beliefs are different from our own and try to \ncompel them to worship God as we see fit. I believe that a handful of \ncorporate CEOs desecrate what the American flag symbolizes when they \nloot the companies they lead and leave employees, pensioners, \nshareholders, and the rest of us holding the bag.\n  I believe we desecrate this beloved symbol of our country when we run \nup massive national debt that our children and our grandchildren will \nspend the rest of their lives trying to dig out from under.\n  I believe we desecrate what our flag symbolizes when some politicians \nwho sought three deferments during an earlier war question the \npatriotism of those of us who served three tours of duty there or left \nthree limbs on the battlefield of that war.\n  And I believe, my friends, that we desecrate all of the good that our \nflag symbolizes about America when we call on other nations to abide by \nthe Geneva Conventions in providing humane treatment of the war \nprisoners they hold while we do not.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seventeen seconds.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time, and \nI will continue the rest of my speech at a later time today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, is there an order in effect for a time \nagreement? How much time do I have, in other words?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority controls the time until 12:30.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to address the resolution that is \nbefore us today and to speak in favor of its adoption. But before I do \nthat, I think it is important first to read what the resolution says, \nbecause I think what we are actually going to be voting on has been \nmisconstrued and, to some extent, inadvertently misrepresented. Also, \nduring the course of my comments, I would like to address those who say \nthat protecting Congress's prerogative to pass laws against flag \ndesecration and those who say it is not important and emphatically \ndisagree with them. And to those who say there are other things we can \nand should be doing, I say, well, we have been very busy doing a lot of \nvery important things, but I certainly believe we have enough time in \nour crowded schedule to address this important issue as well.\n  There are also those who say amending the Constitution is simply \nsomething we should not do, even though we\n\n[[Page S6509]]\n\nhave done so 27 times during the course of our Nation's history, and \neven though the 27th amendment to the United States Constitution \nprovides that Congress can't increase its salary without having an \nintervening election. If we can amend the Constitution for that, which \nI agree is an important provision, we can certainly reinstate \nCongress's authority to pass laws protecting our national emblems and \nour national symbols such as the United States flag.\n  There are also those who try to get off--and again, I know people of \ngood faith have serious disagreements. I don't mean to disparage the \ngood faith of those who say this, but I would challenge those who say \nwe can pass a statute and avoid having to pass a constitutional \namendment. All I would say to that is: Been there. Done that. Doesn't \nwork. The Supreme Court held that subsequent statutory provision \nunconstitutional, just like it did in the Texas case in 1989, the Texas \nlaw that prohibited desecration of the flag.\n  First of all, let me read the constitutional amendment being \nproposed, because there are some who say we are being asked to ban flag \nburning. In fact, this is a restoration of the authority under the \nConstitution to Congress to pass such laws as it deems appropriate, and \nwe can talk about what the details of those bills would be later on, \nonce the amendment is adopted. But it says, simply:\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, that the \n     following article is proposed as an amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States, which shall be valid to \n     all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when \n     ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several \n     States.\n\n  The article says simply this:\n\n       The Congress shall have the power to prohibit the physical \n     desecration of the flag of the United States.\n\n  As I said, this constitutional amendment doesn't actually make it a \ncriminal act to desecrate the flag; it doesn't say what the penalties \nwill be. What this constitutional amendment does is reinstate \nCongress's historical authority to protect the flag against desecration \nand leave for a later date what exactly that statute, that bill, would \nlook like.\n  The reason I feel so strongly about this provision is because of the \nunique nature of our national symbol. The American flag is a monument, \na symbol of our freedom, our country, and our way of life. Why in the \nworld would we refuse to protect it against desecration?\n  As a former President of the United States has noted:\n\n       We identify the flag with almost everything we hold dear on \n     Earth. It represents our peace and security, our civil and \n     political liberty, our freedom of religious worship, our \n     family, our friends, our home. We see it in the great \n     multitude of blessings of rights and privileges that make up \n     our country.\n\n  Another President has said it this way:\n\n       Our flag is a proud flag and it stands for liberty and \n     civilization. Where it has once floated, there must be no \n     return to tyranny.\n\n  We not only pledge allegiance to the flag each day in the Chamber of \nthe U.S. Senate; children across America recite those words at the \nbeginning of each school day, too. We celebrate Flag Day on June 14 of \neach year. We pin to our lapels flag pins and paste it to the windows \nof our cars and trucks. Following 9/11, you could hardly buy a flag, \nbecause they were in such demand as a rallying symbol of American \npatriotism and resolve in the wake of that awful attack, as depicted by \nthis well-remembered picture of first responders in New York erecting \nthe American flag out of the rubble following the deaths of 3,000 \ninnocent Americans.\n  We insist on special rules of etiquette when a flag is handled. When \nI was a Boy Scout growing up, that was one of the things you learned. \nYou learned flag etiquette, how to demonstrate respect for this unique \nsymbol of our country, including learning how, when the flag is old and \ntattered, that special rules of etiquette dictate its disposal.\n  By displaying the flag, we demonstrate our gratitude to the \ngenerations passed who have fought and died for our country. And we \nremind ourselves of the obligation that we have to preserve our freedom \nfor the generations yet to come and to pass along to our children and \ngrandchildren the blessings of liberty that we have come to enjoy \nbecause of the sacrifices of those who have gone before. We drape this \nemblem over the coffins of those who have died in service to our \ncountry, those who have given the last full measure of devotion to keep \nus and our freedom safe. We proudly fly the flag over our Capitol here \nin Washington, DC, and at State capitols and public buildings all over \nour country.\n  Mr. President, recently I read a book about the most famous picture \nin the history of photography. This is a picture we are going to put up \non this board that all of you will instantly recognize. This is a \npicture of Marines erecting the American flag on Iwo Jima in World War \nII, where thousands upon thousands of Marines gave their lives to take \nthis island from the occupiers. The book I read recently is called \n``Flags of Our Fathers,'' written by a man named James Bradley; his \nfather was John. John Bradley, the father of the author, stands in the \nmiddle of the most reproduced figure in the history of photography. \nOnly days before this photo was taken, John Bradley, a Navy corpsman, \nhad braved enemy mortar and machine gun fire to administer first aid to \na wounded Marine and then dragged him to safety. For this act of \nheroism John Bradley would receive the Navy Cross, an award second only \nto the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n\n  One of the amazing things about this book, ``Flags of Our Fathers,'' \nabout this photograph and about John Bradley's service to his country \nas a Marine Corpsman and the service of others of these Marines who \nerected this flag on Iwo Jima in World War II, is that John Bradley, \nlike so many of the Greatest Generation, never spoke of this historic \nmoment or really much of his military service to his family or friends.\n  This reminds me a lot of my dad, who was a B-17 pilot in World War II \nwho, on his 13th mission helping to knock out part of Hitler's war \nmachine in Nazi Germany, was shot down and spent 4 months in a German \nprison camp. And like John Bradley, my dad never talked much about his \nmilitary service. But James Bradley, John Bradley's son, discovered \nthree boxes of artifacts his father had saved about Iwo Jima after his \ndeath, which launched him into a quest to find out a little bit more \nabout his father's past and the past of the five other flag-raisers \ndepicted in this picture.\n  This book explores the lives of all of these flag-raisers, showing \nhow in times of national crisis ordinary Americans have found within \nthemselves an uncommon courage and a capacity to attempt, and achieve, \nthe impossible.\n  Indeed, that is one of the things that makes the American flag \nunique. What becomes of a country that has no special symbols; that \nsomehow, over the passage of time, has deemed itself too sophisticated, \ntoo intelligent, too cynical to be choked by emotion when our flag is \nraised or when the pledge is spoken or when our National Anthem is \nsung?\n  During the Civil War, as James McPherson, a internationally known \nhistorian of that period has noted:\n\n       The most meaningful symbol of regimental pride were the \n     colors--the regimental and national flags, which bonded the \n     men's loyalties to unit, State, and Nation.\n\n  He records one combatant as saying:\n\n       When the American flag appeared above the battle smoke on \n     the enemy works, it is impossible to describe the feelings \n     one experiences at such a moment. God, country, love, home, \n     pride, conscious strength and power, all crowd your swelling \n     breast. Proud, proud as a man can feel over this victory to \n     our arms. If it were a man's privilege to die when he wished, \n     he would die at that moment.\n\n  These are not my words; these are the words of those who, in the \nservice of their country, gained inspiration and purpose from this \nsymbol that is a unique symbol, unlike any other we have in this \ncountry.\n  But ultimately, there are those on the floor of the U.S. Senate who \nask: Well, is this really important enough to amend the United States \nConstitution? To those I would say, the question is not whether the \nConstitution should be amended; it already has been by judicial decree. \nThe question then remains, who gets the final word? Five Justices on \nthe United States Supreme Court or we, the people?\n  Not important? I disagree. This, I believe, is the ultimate test of \nour form\n\n[[Page S6510]]\n\nof government, based as it is upon consent of the government. Our \nFounding Fathers recognized that our Constitution might need to be \namended over time and thus article V of the Constitution creates a \ndifficult but nevertheless a way forward to amend the Constitution when \nthe American people see fit.\n  Of course, this process will not stop upon this body's passage of \nthis amendment. Assuming we are able to get the two-thirds vote \nrequirement in the Senate and in the House, then it will go to the \nStates, where three-quarters of the States must ratify the amendment \nfor it to become the 28th amendment to the United States Constitution.\n  I believe, to quote the Declaration of Independence, that the powers \nof the Federal Government emanate from ``the consent of the governed.'' \nIn other words, I believe that we as a nation do not have to accept as \nfinal the judgment of five Judges who, in 1989, in the Texas v. Johnson \ncase, held the Texas flag desecration law unconstitutional.\n  The amazing thing about this debate is I do not think there are very \nmany people who recognize that before 1989, when the U.S. Supreme Court \nstruck down the Texas flag desecration statute, 48 States, including \nthe District of Columbia, had laws criminalizing flag desecration--48 \nStates. But, lo and behold, 200 years after its adoption, five Judges \ndecided that the first amendment of the Constitution of the United \nStates, which guarantees free speech, renders all of those 48 flag \ndesecration statutes unconstitutional as being a limitation on free \nspeech. Don't mind the fact that it is really not about speech, it is \nabout behavior. It is not about what you say, it is about what you do. \nBut the Supreme Court, five members of the Court, didn't seem to have \ntoo much trouble with that.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist, recently departed, in the dissent to that \ncase of Texas v. Johnson in 1989 that struck down all 48 flag \ndesecration statutes, wrote:\n\n       The American flag, then, throughout more than 200 years of \n     history, has come to be the visible symbol embodying our \n     Nation. It does not represent the views of any particular \n     political party, and it does not represent any particular \n     political philosophy. The flag is not simply another ``idea'' \n     or ``point of view'' competing for recognition in the \n     marketplace of ideas. Millions and millions of Americans \n     [Chief Justice Rehnquist said] regard it with an almost \n     mystical reverence, regardless of what sort of social, \n     political or philosophical beliefs they may have. I cannot \n     agree that the first amendment invalidates the act of \n     Congress and the laws of 48 of the 50 States which make \n     criminal the public burning of the flag.\n\n  Justice Stevens, not necessarily of the same sort of judicial \nideology or bent as Chief Justice Rehnquist, also dissented, and he \nsaid:\n\n       The flag is more than a proud symbol of the courage, the \n     determination, and the gifts of nature that transformed 13 \n     fledgling Colonies into a world power. It is a symbol of \n     freedom, of equal opportunity, of religious tolerance, and of \n     good will for the other peoples who share our aspirations. . \n     . . The value of the flag as a symbol cannot be measured.\n\n  Justice Stevens concluded:\n\n       The case has nothing to do with ``disagreeable ideas.'' It \n     involves disagreeable conduct that, in my opinion, diminishes \n     the value of an important national asset . . .\n\n  And that Johnson, the defendant in that case, was punished only for \nthe means by which he expressed his opinion, not the opinion itself.\n  I mentioned a moment ago that there are those of our colleagues who \nin good faith think that we can fix this problem by simply passing \nanother flag desecration statute in the U.S. Congress. I would point \nout to my colleagues that we have already tried to do that right after \nthe Texas v. Johnson case. The U.S. Congress overwhelmingly passed a \nstatute which was struck down by the same five Justices on the U.S. \nSupreme Court in a case called United States v. Eichman.\n  It is clear that no statute can pass constitutional muster as long as \nthe Texas v. Johnson decision is on the books. There are some who would \noffer an amendment--maybe during the course of this debate--who in good \nfaith think that if they limit the reach of the statute to fighting \nwords, in other words some act that would provoke violence in a public \nplace, that somehow they have fixed the problem. But we are not just \ntalking about provoking people by what is tantamount to fighting words \nby protecting the flag. We are talking about protecting a valuable \nnational symbol of all of the things our country has come to mean, both \nto us and to those abroad; and that the good faith of our colleagues \nnotwithstanding, no statute that we might pass could possibly fix the \nproblem of five Judges assuming after 200 years that flag desecration \nis protected speech, that it violates the first amendment of the \nConstitution.\n  We all know as a matter of constitutional law that no statute can fix \na constitutional violation. So only a constitutional amendment, passed \nby Congress and ratified by three-quarters of the States, could \npossibly fix this problem.\n  Those who complain and say this is an imaginary problem, that we do \nnot have acts of flag desecration today or why are we talking about \nthis in 2006 if the Supreme Court held this flag desecration statute \nunconstitutional in 1989, there is a very simple reason we are still \ntalking about it today. It is because we have been working on it under \nthe leadership of Senator Orrin Hatch and others for 11 years.\n  I think the first constitutional amendment that was introduced was in \n1995, and we have gradually been making progress each year by getting \nmore and more support in the Senate. I hope our colleagues today will \nmeet the challenge and deliver the 67 votes needed in this Chamber in \norder to move this constitutional amendment along.\n  To those who say this is an imaginary problem, I will say simply look \nat the facts. The Citizens Flag Alliance has a Web site in which they \ndemonstrate 17 acts of flag desecration in the United States over the \nlast 2 years. It may be these are not widely reported in the press. I \nam not sure exactly what the reason is. But there are 17 acts of flag \ndesecration just in the last 2 years. This is not a contrived or \nimaginary issue.\n  I remember the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, the Senator \nfrom Vermont, saying he was vehemently against the constitutional \namendment because he didn't think we ought to tamper with the \nConstitution--notwithstanding the Founding Fathers provided article V \nto give us a means to amend the Constitution when a sufficient number \nof people in the Congress and across the country see fit. But I think \nhe said something like: If anyone had the temerity to desecrate the \nflag in his presence, they wouldn't need a statute criminalizing that \nact. They would have to get past him to get to wherever it was they \nwere going, suggesting that perhaps individuals who were sufficiently \nmotivated might, through acts of violence, perhaps, dictate justice.\n  I do not think that is a sufficient answer. This is a real issue. It \nis not contrived, as demonstrated by the 17 acts of desecration in the \nlast 2 years. It is not a problem we can fix by passing a statute and \npatting ourselves on the back and saying: Yes, we fixed that problem. \nThis is a problem that calls for a constitutional amendment.\n  Yes, I know how serious that is. I don't lightly suggest amendments \nto the Constitution. But I sincerely believe in my heart of hearts this \nunique symbol of our country and all of our aspirations and dreams--not \nonly for people here but the kinds of aspirations and dreams that are a \nbeacon to those who will come here in the future, and the generations \nthat come here after--I believe it deserves special protection. Thus, I \nbelieve we ought to take this opportunity to say yes.\n  Congress does have a voice in this. Yes, the American people do have \na voice in whether the flag is protected. The only way we can do that \nis by passing this resolution by two-thirds of the Senate and moving \nthis process along and then leaving it up to the people of America, the \nthree-quarters of the States that will have to ratify this before it \nbecomes final. Let them have a word.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S6511]]\n\n  Mr. CORNYN.

The Senator from Maine--Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, both are beautiful States. Maine is the \nlargest land area, the largest State in New England. Most people are \nsurprised to know that Vermont is the second largest. We beat out New \nHampshire by about 90 square miles--larger than Massachusetts, larger \nthan Connecticut, larger than Rhode Island. Smallest in population, but \nwe take a back seat to no one in our independence.\n  I am glad to see my friend, the Presiding Officer, the distinguished \nSenator, and distinguished former Governor.\n  I commend the senior Senator from Connecticut for his outstanding \nstatement last night and the senior Senator from Illinois, our \nAssistant Democratic leader, for his cogent observations on this \nmatter. The statement this morning by the Senator from Vermont, a \nveteran, a man of principle and courage, made me proud to serve with \nhim in representing the people of our great State. I thank the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the Constitution Subcommittee \nfor his statement, and the Senator from Delaware, another veteran, for \nhis well-chosen words, as well.\n  This morning we awoke to read the latest example of this \nadministration's incompetence. Because of bureaucratic bungling, widows \nof those who have served this Nation and sacrificed for all of us have \nbeen denied the survivors' benefits to which they should be entitled. A \nleader of the Gold Star Wives of America, a group of 10,000 military \nwidows, was quoted as saying:\n\n       It is shameful that the government and Congress do not \n     deliver the survivor benefits equally to all our widows with \n     the same compassion and precision the military presents the \n     folded flag at the grave.\n\n  Edie Smith is right and we should be ashamed.\n  This news follows other recent public reports that posttraumatic \nstress disorders among our veterans are on the rise. Instead of seeking \nto turn the flag into a partisan political weapon and the Constitution \ninto a billboard for political slogans, for partisan gain, we should be \nworking to fulfill the pressing needs of our veterans and their \nfamilies. I wish the Senate would use its time to discuss and solve the \nreal problems that real Americans are facing right now, instead of \ntrying to stir public passions for political ends.\n  The Republican leadership so rushed this amendment to the floor that \nthere was not a single Senate hearing on it in this Congress. It was \nmarked up in a side room off the Senate Chamber rather than in the \nregular public hearing room for the Judiciary Committee with very \nlittle debate, and it was reported without a committee report. This is \nthe second time in a month that this Senate is rushing to debate a \nconstitutional amendment without following the procedures that ensure \nthoughtfulness in such an important debate on a proposal to change our \nfundamental charter and, in this instance, cut back on the Bill of \nRights for the first time in our history.\n  It was noted today in one of the newspapers that the U.S. Senate--the \nconscience of the country--is expected to spend 4 days debating this \namendment--1 for each incident of flag burning that purportedly \noccurred this year in a Nation of 300 million people. I respectfully \nsuggest that in the less than 10 weeks left to us in session this year, \nthe Senate's resources would be better spent working to improve \nveterans' health care services, survivors' benefits and protecting \nveterans' and Americans' privacy. We have just witnessed the largest \ntheft of private information from the Government ever, the loss of \ninformation on more than 26.5 million American veterans, including more \nthan 2 million who are in active service, nearly 80 percent of our \nactive-duty force and a large percentage of our National Guard and the \nReserve. Why? Because this administration was so incompetent they did \nnot think to lock the door.\n  This same administration says we need a constitutional amendment to \nban flag burning in order to protect our veterans. We are not going to \ndo anything to protect their credit records; we are not going to do \nanything to protect their privacy. We will leave the door open on that. \nBut we have to watch out for the flag.\n  Let me quote what a spokeswoman for the American Legion said \nrecently:\n\n       Our armed forces personnel have enough on their plates with \n     fighting the global war on terror, let alone having to worry \n     about identity theft while deployed overseas. A spokesman for \n     the VFW said: This confirms the VFW's worst fear from day \n     one--that the loss of data encompasses every single person \n     who did wear the uniform and does wear the uniform today.\n\n  What does the Bush-Cheney administration say? If you are over there \nfighting in Ramallah and your identity has been stolen, don't worry. We \nhave an 800-number you can call and maybe buy some insurance or \nsomething to protect your credit. Well, call once you are not getting \nshot at.\n\n  Because of the Bush-Cheney administration's recklessness, our \nveterans and our active-duty servicemembers are now worried whether \ntheir personal information is being sold on the black market or \navailable to foreign intelligence services or terrorists. That adds up \nto a heckuva bad job for America's veterans and our men and women in \nuniform.\n  Compounding the incompetence was the misguided impulse of the \nadministration to keep everything secret for as long as they could. \nThree weeks after the theft, it was finally disclosed. Three weeks \nafter that, the administration finally announced that it would do what \nit should have done from day 1 by making credit reporting available to \nthose affected. And the administration is still fighting paying for its \nmistakes. It is resisting the efforts by Senators Byrd and Murray to \nprovide the money needed to pay for credit monitoring and proposing to \ntake the money from veterans health care or other programs. That is \nwrong.\n  Such incompetence at the Bush-Cheney Department of Veterans Affairs \nis worse than anything I have seen in the six Presidential \nadministrations I have served with. At some point, this administration \nbetter stop appointing and hiring cronies, and at some point it might \nreally take responsibility. Then we could have some real accountability \nfor their incompetence. The American people suffer, the veterans are at \nrisk, but those in responsibility get medals and promotions and the \nRepublican Congress never gets to the bottom of what happened to make \nsure it will not happen again.\n  Rather than work on our privacy and identity theft legislation, \nrather than proceed on a bill protecting veterans, such as Senator \nAkaka's or Senator Kerry's, we are being directed to another divisive \ndebate on a proposed constitutional amendment. The White House calls \nthe tune, and this Republican-led Congress is quick to dance to it. \nThis is a White House that does not even list ``veterans'' as an issue \non its Web site.\n  The Nation's veterans--who have been willing to make the ultimate \nsacrifice for their country--deserve better. In his second inaugural, \nwhile the Nation was fighting the Civil War, President Lincoln \nconcluded with words that became the motto of the Veterans \nAdministration and remains on metal plaques around the Vermont Avenue \ndoors of the VA office here in Washington:\n\n       To care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his \n     widow, and his orphan.\n\n  In this fundamental mission, this administration has lost its way.\n  What the Bush administration's budget says is that honoring veterans \nis not a priority, especially when it comes to medical care. The \nPresident's budget requests consistently fall short of the levels \nneeded to provide necessary services and care. Secretary Nicholson had \nto admit a billion dollar shortfall last year after first issuing \ninaccurate and unfounded denials of his mismanagement. Secretary \nPrincipi before him had testified that the Veterans Department asked \nthe White\n\n[[Page S6512]]\n\nHouse for an additional $1.2 billion but that it was denied.\n  Veterans groups and families know that even these budget requests are \ninadequate--nearly $3 billion less than what veterans groups like the \nAmerican Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the Paralyzed \nVeterans of America recommend in the Independent Budget. These \norganizations know what it will take to meet veterans' health care \nneeds.\n  And when Democratic Senators, such as Senators Murray, Akaka, or \nNelson, offer amendments to fund veterans programs, Republicans refuse \nto support those amendments to bring funding up to the levels \nrecommended by the independent budget and just plain common sense.\n  We heard in March 2004 from the chairman of the Citizens Flag \nAlliance, Major General Patrick Brady, that ``we have never fully met \nthe needs of our veterans.'' This echoed General Brady's frank \nadmission following our April 1999 hearing that ``the most pressing \nissues facing our veterans'' were not flag burnings but rather ``broken \npromises, especially health care.'' Sadly, it appears that playing \npolitics with veterans' emotions rather than sustaining their health \ncare is nothing new.\n  During the past 5 years, Congress has had to add billions of dollars \nmore to the President's budget request just to fill gaps in basic \nservices. If we had done as the President asked year after year, \nveterans' medical care would be in even worse shape. Unfortunately, \nthis year the Congress is not off to an encouraging start. The most \nrecent supplemental spending bill excluded almost $400 million in \nadditional spending for the veterans' health care. Again, the \nadministration said it did not need the additional funding--but our \nveterans need it.\n  The Bush-Cheney administration's budget for veterans does not account \nfor the increase in demand for VA services during the Iraq war. With \nnearly 20 percent of those returning from Iraq reporting mental health \nproblems and 35 percent of Iraq war veterans needing health care \nservices, we are cutting the money. Consider the cost of inflation and \nthe increased costs for medicine and services and you can understand \nwhy the American Legion projects that more than $1 billion is needed in \nfurther funding just to meet annual payroll and medical inflation \ncosts.\n  Most disturbing is the move to make veterans contribute a larger \nshare to provide their own health care. The Bush-Cheney administration \ncontinues efforts to impose onerous fees and copayments on our Nation's \nveterans. This parallels the demands on families to buy armor, helmets, \nand other supplies for their family members serving overseas in our \nArmed Forces. It is the first time since the Revolution that we have \nsent our forces out there having to buy their own equipment when they \nwent to war.\n  The Bush administration plans to increase by almost $800 million this \nyear the fees and collections from third parties for veterans' health \ncare. They plan on imposing an annual enrollment fee and doubling \nprescription drug copayments for certain veterans. Veterans are being \nforced to subsidize their government health care. So much for the words \non the veterans building in Washington.\n  I could go on and on describing the claims backlog, the longer waits, \nand the cuts in service. To add insult to injury, the GAO reported \nrecently that hundreds of battle-wounded soldiers are being pursued for \ncollection of military debts incurred through no fault of their own, \ndue to long-recognized problems with military computer systems. The \nbottom line is that the administration's rhetoric toward veterans \nsimply does not match its real priorities.\n  We seem headed back to the time after World War I when veterans had \nto come to Washington and live in tent cities to demand that the \nGovernment honor the words of President Lincoln and care for them and \nthose others had left behind.\n  Instead of debating polarizing issues that we have talked about in \nelection years, we should be acting to provide real resources for our \nmen and women who served this country with honor and sacrifice.\n  I will ask to have printed in the Record a collection of recent \nnewspaper articles on veterans needs.\n  I have stated my position on this flag-burning amendment before. I \nhave stated before that Vermont, the 14th State to join the Union, \njoined the same year that the Bill of Rights was ratified, then joined \nby the 15th State. And that became the flag that we had for many years \nin this country, with 15 stars and 15 stripes. But we Vermonters want \nto make sure that our rights are being protected.\n  We amend the Constitution according to the Constitution when there is \nan urgent need to do so. We have never amended the Bill of Rights--\nnever, ever. Since World War II, since the Civil War, no matter what \nthe threat, we have never amended the Bill of Rights. Now we are being \nasked for the first time to amend the first amendment.\n  We are told there is an urgent need. My God, what is the urgent need? \nEspecially since 9/11, more Americans fly the flag probably than any \ntime in my lifetime. I fly the flag outside of my home in Vermont \nwhenever I am there. I flew it for my son when he joined the Marines. I \nflew it when he finished his time in the Marines.\n  My flag is protected. If anyone were to steal it, destroy it, \ndesecrate it, they could be prosecuted.\n  I fly my flag because I want to, and I protect it because I want to. \nI do not need a law to tell me to do so.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the aforementioned \narticles be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Military Fails Some Widows Over Benefits\n\n                          (By Lizette Alvarez)\n\n       June 27, 2006.--As Holly Wren coped with her 6-month-old \n     son and the sorrow of losing her husband in Iraq last \n     November, she assumed that the military's sense of structure \n     and order would apply in death as it had in life.\n       Instead she encountered numerous hurdles in trying to \n     collect survivor benefits. She received only half the amount \n     owed her for housing because her husband, one of the highest \n     ranking soldiers to die in Iraq, was listed as single, \n     childless and living in Florida--wrong on every count. Lt. \n     Col. Thomas Wren was married, with five children, and living \n     in Northern Virginia.\n       She waited months for her husband's retirement money and \n     more than two weeks for his death benefit, meant to arrive \n     within days. And then Mrs. Wren went to court to become her \n     son's legal guardian because no one had told her husband that \n     a minor cannot be a beneficiary. ``You are a number, and your \n     husband is a number'' said Mrs. Wren, who ultimately asked \n     her congressman for help. ``They need to understand that we \n     are more than that.''\n       For military widows, many of them young, stay-at-home \n     mothers, the shock of losing a husband is often followed by \n     the confounding task of untangling a collection of benefits \n     from assorted bureaucracies.\n       While the process runs smoothly for many widows, for others \n     it is characterized by lost files, long delays, an avalanche \n     of paperwork, misinformation and gaps in the patchwork of \n     laws governing survivor benefits.\n       Sometimes it is simply the Pentagon's massive bureaucracy \n     that poses the problem. In other cases, laws exclude widows \n     whose husbands died too early in the war or were killed in \n     training rather than in combat. The result is that scores of \n     families--it is impossible to know how many--lose out on \n     money and benefits that they expected to receive or believed \n     they were owed, say widows, advocates and legislators.\n       ``Why do we want to draw arbitrary and capricious lines \n     that exclude widows?'' asked Senator Mike DeWine, an Ohio \n     Republican, who has sponsored legislation to close some of \n     the legal loopholes that penalize widows. ``It seems to me we \n     ought to err on the side of compassion for families.''\n       Mr. DeWine said Congress sometimes passes these loopholes \n     without considering the ramifications. But money also plays a \n     large factor, and Congress is sometimes compelled to keep \n     down costs associated with the war. ``That's what you hear \n     behind the scenes,'' Senator De Wine said.\n       The Army is also trying to address the problem, for \n     example, with new call centers intended to help survivors \n     navigate the bewildering bureaucracy. ``As we always have, we \n     constantly re-evaluate how we conduct our business to see if \n     we can improve,'' said Col. Mary Torgersen, director of the \n     Army casualty affairs operations center.\n       But legislators and advocates working with widows say the \n     problems are often systemic, involving payouts by the mammoth \n     Department of Defense accounting office and the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs.\n       A few widows simply fall through the cracks altogether. The \n     consequences are hard felt: they run up credit card bills, \n     move in with relatives to save money, pull their children \n     from private schools, spend money on lawyers or dedicate \n     countless frustrating hours to unraveling the mix-ups.\n       ``We have had more of these cases than I wish to know,'' \n     said Ann G. Knowles, president of the National Association of \n     County Veterans Service Officers, which helps veterans and \n     widows with their claims.\n\n[[Page S6513]]\n\n       The Department of Defense offers widows a range of \n     benefits, including retirement security money, health care, \n     life insurance payouts and a $100,000 death gratuity. The \n     Department of Veterans Affairs allocates a minimum $1,033 \n     monthly stipend and temporary transition assistance, among \n     other things.\n       Widows also receive money from the Social Security \n     Administration.\n       But a benefit is only as valuable as a widow's ability to \n     claim it. Just days after her husband was killed in Iraq by a \n     roadside bomb, Laura Youngblood, who was pregnant with their \n     second child, got another piece of sobering news from the \n     Navy: Her mother-in-law, who had been estranged from the \n     family for several years, would be receiving half of her \n     husband's $400,000 life insurance payment.\n       Nearly a year later, Mrs. Youngblood, 27, is still trying \n     to persuade the Navy that the military's accounting \n     department lost her husband's 2004 insurance form naming her \n     and her son as co-beneficiaries, along with the rest of his \n     predeployment paperwork. The only forms the Navy can find are \n     from 2003, listing an old address for her husband, Travis, an \n     incorrect rank and no dependents.\n       The military paperwork was in such disarray, Mrs. \n     Youngblood said, that her husband went months without combat \n     pay and family separation pay because the defense accounting \n     service did not realize he was in Iraq, where he was detached \n     to a Marine Corps unit.\n       When the Navy said there was nothing it could do, the \n     Marine Inspector General's office stepped in to investigate, \n     forwarding findings to the Navy Inspector General's office. \n     ``These were my husband's dying wishes: to take care of his \n     children,'' said Mrs. Youngblood, who has hired a lawyer to \n     help her. ``You honor his wishes. That's his blood money.''\n       Congress has won plaudits in the past two years for \n     increasing the payment after a soldier's death from $12,420 \n     to $100,000 and upping the life insurance payout from \n     $250,000 to $400,000. It made available to some recent widows \n     a retirement income benefit for free. Congress has also paved \n     the way for more generous health and housing benefits. Adding \n     to that, numerous states have recently introduced free \n     college tuition and property tax savings.\n       ``Since 9/11, the demands on survivors are greater and they \n     are getting much more in benefits,'' said Brad Snyder, the \n     president of Armed Forces Services Corporation, which helps \n     survivors with benefits. ``The expectations of what we had in \n     Vietnam were much lower.''\n       But to the widows, some of whom adapted their lives to \n     conform to the military, following their husbands from place \n     to place, the complications can sting.\n       Jennifer McCollum, 32, who was raised on bases and whose \n     husband, Capt. Dan McCollum, a Marine Corps pilot, died in \n     2002 when his plane crashed in Pakistan, has been busy \n     lobbying Congress to reverse gaps in the law that penalize \n     some widows financially simply because of when their husbands \n     died.\n       ``The president, whom I support, said in the State of the \n     Union address that he would not forget the families of the \n     fallen,'' she said. ``Why have I had to go to D.C. five times \n     this year?''\n\n\n                            Gaps in the Laws\n\n       Hundreds of widows are denied thousands of dollars in \n     benefits because of arbitrary cut-off dates in the law. The \n     family of a soldier who was killed in October 2003 receives \n     less money than the family of a soldier who was killed in \n     October 2005. ``It is shameful that the government and \n     Congress do not deliver the survivor benefits equally to all \n     our widows with the same compassion and precision the \n     military presents the folded flag at the grave,'' said Edie \n     Smith, a leader of the Gold Star Wives of America, a group of \n     10,000 military widows that lobbies Congress and the \n     Pentagon.\n       Shauna Moore was tending to her newborn, Hannah, on Feb. \n     21, 2003, when she learned that her husband, Sgt. Benjamin \n     Moore, 25, had been shot during a rifle training exercise at \n     Fort Hood, Tex. Months later, after her grief began to \n     subside, she noticed that she was not entitled to the same \n     retirement benefits as more recent widows with children.\n       Congress allowed certain widows to sign over to their \n     children their husband's retirement benefit, sidestepping a \n     steep so-called military widow's tax. But the law applies \n     only to the widows of service members who died after Nov. 23, \n     2003. Mrs. Moore is one of an estimated 430 spouses with \n     children who are ineligible.\n       If that option were available to Mrs. Moore, she would \n     collect an extra $10,000 a year until Hannah became an adult.\n       ``It makes a difference, if you are a single mom,'' she \n     said.\n       Last week, the Senate approved Senator DeWine's measure \n     that would extend the benefit to widows whose husbands died \n     as far back as Oct. 7, 2001, the start of the war in \n     Afghanistan. The House did not approve a similar measure, \n     which is tucked into the Senate Defense Authorization bill, \n     so now the issue must be resolved in negotiations.\n       Hundreds of widows also fail to qualify for a monthly \n     payment of $250 in transition assistance, from the Department \n     of Veterans Affairs, paid to help children for two years \n     after their father's death. It applies only to those spouses \n     whose husbands died after Feb. 1, 2005. Those who lost \n     husbands before February 2003 received nothing because their \n     transition is presumably over, and those who were widowed \n     from 2003 to 2005 received a smaller amount.\n       Congress has closed some glaring gaps in laws, including \n     one that excluded many families from the $100,000 death \n     benefit and the $400,000 insurance payout because the \n     soldiers' deaths were not combat-related. The outcry forced \n     Congress last year to include all active-duty deaths since \n     Oct. 7, 2001, in those benefits.\n\n\n                             The Long Wait\n\n       Even good intentions demand patience. A much-upgraded \n     health care benefit to help the children of service members \n     who died on active duty has yet to be implemented after 18 \n     months because the new regulations have not been written.\n       Because Champus/Tricare, the federal insurer for military \n     families, does not recognize the law, widows are still paying \n     out more money for health care, which some can ill afford.\n       The January 2005 law will greatly improve health care for \n     all children. But Nichole Haycock's severely disabled son, \n     Colten, 13, may not be among them.\n       Her husband, Sgt. First Class Jeffrey Haycock, 38, died in \n     April 2002 after a run; Army doctors had failed to tell him \n     about a heart condition they had discovered two months \n     before. But because her husband did not die in a combat-\n     related situation, her son was denied admission to a program \n     for the disabled.\n       As she teeters on the brink of exhaustion, her two other \n     children get short shrift. ``It's been very difficult to care \n     for a child that is this severe by myself,'' Mrs. Haycock \n     said. ``I would love to see my daughter and son in school \n     events. But I can't do those things.''\n       Tricare officials cannot say for sure whether her son will \n     be covered by the 2005 law when the regulations are written. \n     Francine Forestell, the chief of its customer communications \n     division, said federal regulators plan to interpret it as \n     broadly as possible, ``but we can't promise anything,'' she \n     said.\n\n\n                      A Lost Life but No Insurance\n\n       Few cases are as heartbreaking as the widow who winds up \n     with little or no life insurance money after her husband's \n     death. In many instances, the husband simply neglected to \n     change the beneficiary. Little, if anything, can be done to \n     recoup the money in such a case after it has been paid out, \n     and advocates emphasize that couples must do a better job of \n     educating themselves about benefits at pre-deployment family \n     meetings.\n       But in some cases, widows said that they had done their \n     jobs, had double-checked the paperwork and something still \n     went wrong.\n       Staff Sgt. Dexter Kimble, 30, a marine, was killed Jan. 26, \n     2005, when his chopper crashed in an Iraqi sandstorm. It was \n     his third deployment. Before he left, he redid all his \n     deployment paperwork, after consulting with his wife, \n     Dawanna. She noticed that the life insurance form on file \n     still had designated his mother as a co-beneficiary.\n       ``I said, `What is this? Because I just had baby number \n     four,' '' Mrs. Kimble said. ``He had not added baby number \n     four to the paperwork, either. He said, `Don't worry. I'm \n     switching that and making you the sole beneficiary.' ''\n       After his funeral, Mrs. Kimble said her casualty assistance \n     officer informed her that her husband's paperwork had not \n     been filed on time. The system had processed the 2001 form, \n     and her mother-in-law had received half the $400,000. Her \n     casualty officer offered to call her mother-in-law and \n     explain what had happened.\n       ``I assumed it wouldn't be a question of if,'' Mrs. Kimble \n     said about the money, ``but when.''\n       Mrs. Kimble, who lives in Southern California, did not get \n     any money from her mother-in-law. She received $300,000--the \n     death benefit and half of the insurance money--but used a \n     chunk to help pay her extended family's way to the burial and \n     to pay off the car and other debts. Maj. Jason Johnston, a \n     public affairs officer for the Marine Corps Air Station \n     Miramar, said the corps processed what it had. ``I'm not \n     saying the system is infallible,'' he said. ``Anything is \n     possible.\n       ``If the Marine tells the spouse one thing and does \n     another,'' he added, ``that is very unfortunate. But we have \n     to go by what the marine puts in the system.''\n       Mrs. Kimble has taken a dead-end job in San Diego and is \n     worried about the future. To get to work, she gets up at 4 \n     a.m. She pulled one child out of private school. She left her \n     home and is living with her children in a friend's empty \n     house. She is also paying for child care for four children.\n       Lawrence Kelly, a lawyer who is representing Mrs. \n     Youngblood and Mrs. Kimble, said the problem is not unlike \n     that confronted by thousands of soldiers who have recently \n     faced mistakes in their pay made by the military's mammoth \n     accounting office. ``Same system, same bureaucracy, same \n     results,'' he said.\n       Responding to concerns from widows, Congress last year \n     passed a law stating that if there is a change in the \n     beneficiary or in the amount of the insurance, a spouse must \n     be notified. But the law left a major loophole: If a service \n     member makes no change in his beneficiary after he marries--\n     if his mother or father were originally named and he did not \n     change it--his wife does not have to be notified.\n\n[[Page S6514]]\n\n       ``It has left me frustrated and very bitter,'' Mrs. Kimble \n     said. ``We have already sacrificed our husbands. Our children \n     are fatherless. For them to struggle financially is another \n     blow.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, April 27, 2006]\n\n        GAO Says Government Pesters Wounded Soldiers Over Debts\n\n                         (By Donna St. George)\n\n       Nearly 900 soldiers wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan have \n     been saddled with government debts as they have recovered \n     from war, according to a report that describes collection \n     notices going out to veterans with brain damage, paralysis, \n     lost limbs and shrapnel wounds.\n       The report from the Government Accountability Office, to be \n     released at a hearing today, details how long-recognized \n     problems with military computer systems led to the soldiers \n     being dunned for an array of debts related to everything from \n     errors in paychecks to equipment left behind on the \n     battlefield.\n       The problem came to light last year, as soldiers' \n     complaints began to surface and several lawmakers became \n     involved. The GAO had been investigating other pay problems \n     caused by the defense accounting system and was asked by \n     Congress to investigate debts among the battle-wounded.\n       The new report shows a problem more widespread than \n     previously known.\n       ``We found that hundreds of separated battle-injured \n     soldiers were pursued for collection of military debts \n     incurred through no fault of their own,'' the report said.\n       Last fall, the Army said 331 soldiers had been hit with \n     military debt after being wounded at war. The latest figures \n     show that a larger group of 900 battle-wounded troops has \n     been tagged with debts.\n       ``It's unconscionable,'' said Ryan Kelly, 25, a retired \n     staff sergeant who lost a leg to a roadside bomb and then \n     spent more than a year trying to fend off a debt of $2,231. \n     ``It's sad that we'd let that happen.''\n       Kelly recalled the day in 2004 when, months after learning \n     to walk on a prosthesis, he opened his mailbox to find a \n     letter saying he was in debt to the government--and in \n     jeopardy of referral to a collection agency. ``It hits you in \n     the gut,'' he said. ``It's like, `Thanks for your service, \n     and now you owe us.''\n       The underlying problem is an antiquated computer system for \n     paying and tracking members of the military. Pay records are \n     not integrated with personnel records, creating numerous \n     errors. When soldiers leave the battlefield, for example, \n     they lose a pay differential, but the system can take time to \n     lower their pay.\n       The government then tries to recoup overpayments, docking \n     pay for active-duty troops and sending debt notices to those \n     who have left the military. Eventually, the government sends \n     private agencies to collect debts and notifies credit \n     bureaus.\n       The computer system is so broken that 400 soldiers killed \n     in action were listed as owing money to the government, \n     although no debt notices were sent, the report said.\n       A total of $1.5 million in debts has been linked to the 400 \n     fallen soldiers and 900 wounded troops. Of the total, \n     $124,000 has been repaid. The government has waived $959,000, \n     and the remainder of $420,000 is still owed.\n       Michael Hurst, a former Army finance officer in Arlington \n     who has studied the issue, said the military should have \n     taken action years ago to prevent the debts from being \n     created.\n       ``It's a complete leadership failure,'' he said. ``We can't \n     expect the soldiers to notice mistakes in their pay that the \n     paid professionals have failed to notice and correct.''\n       Although the GAO report focuses on battle-wounded soldiers \n     who have separated from the military, there are probably \n     others who were still on active duty when their debts caught \n     up with them, Hurst said. Factoring those in, ``I would say \n     thousands'' are affected by the problem, he said.\n       The GAO report said that 73 percent of the debts were \n     caused by pay problems, including overpayments, calculation \n     errors and mistakes in leave. Other debts were created when \n     soldiers were billed for enlistment bonuses, medical \n     services, travel and lost equipment.\n       House Government Reform Committee Chairman Thomas M. Davis \n     III (R-Va.), who is holding the hearing, has called the \n     phenomenon ``financial friendly fire.'' Yesterday, his \n     spokesman, Robert White, reacted to the report, saying: \n     ``Literally adding insult to injury, the systems that are \n     supposed to nurture and support returning warriors too often \n     inflict additional wounds to their financial health.''\n       In one case cited in the GAO report, the debts meant that a \n     soldier's family had no money to pay bills and had to send an \n     11-year-old daughter to live out of state.\n       At today's hearing, Army and Defense Department officials \n     are expected to testify about what is being done to correct \n     the problem. A database of soldiers wounded in action has \n     been created, but the GAO suggested that more needs to be \n     done, including congressional action to forgive more \n     soldiers' debts and provide refunds in certain cases.\n       Previously the GAO had issued 80 recommendations for \n     improving the Army payroll processes. Army officials have \n     said they are at work on those recommendations. An Army \n     spokesman did not return calls yesterday requesting comment.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 24, 2006]\n\nVeterans Angered by File Scandal--VA Has Consistently Scored Poorly on \n                          Information Security\n\n                           By Christopher Lee\n\n       Veterans brimmed with shock and anger yesterday at the loss \n     of their personal data by the Department of Veterans Affairs, \n     but in many ways the information security breach should not \n     have come as a surprise.\n       The department has consistently ranked near the bottom \n     among federal agencies in an annual congressional scorecard \n     of computer security. For five years, the VA inspector \n     general has identified information security as a material \n     weakness and faulted officials for slow progress in tackling \n     the problem.\n       As many as 26.5 million veterans were put at risk of \n     identity theft May 3 when an intruder stole an electronic \n     data file from the Aspen Hill home of a VA data analyst, who \n     was not authorized to remove the data from his office. The \n     electronic file contained names, birth dates and Social \n     Security numbers of veterans discharged since 1975, as well \n     as veterans who were discharged earlier and filed for VA \n     benefits.\n       VA officials waited two weeks to call in the FBI to \n     investigate the theft, the Associated Press reported, citing \n     two law enforcement sources.\n       ``To the best of my knowledge, the loss of 26 million \n     records by VA is the largest by a federal agency to date,'' \n     said Rep. Thomas M. Davis III (R-Va.), chairman of the House \n     Government Reform Committee. ``Perhaps if the department \n     improved its compliance with the existing information \n     protection laws, this breach would not have happened. There \n     seem to be two problems here: a department that's \n     inadequately protected, and an employee who acted incredibly \n     irresponsibly.''\n       In 2005, Veterans Affairs earned an F on the annual federal \n     computer security report card compiled by Davis's committee, \n     the same grade it has received every year but one since the \n     scorecard began in 2001. (It got a C in 2003.) The \n     government-wide average for 2005 was a D-plus, but there were \n     wide variations--the Social Security Administration got an A-\n     plus, while the departments of Defense and Homeland Security \n     earned F's.\n       The report card measures compliance with the 2002 Federal \n     Information Security Management Act, which requires agencies \n     to test their systems, develop cyber-security plans and \n     report on their progress.\n       ``We continue to get a number of wake-up calls from these \n     breaches that shows that we still have a ways to go before we \n     have a truly robust information security posture \n     nationally,'' said Greg Garcia, vice president for \n     information security at the trade group Information \n     Technology Association of America.\n       Veterans groups reported mounting anger and frustration.\n       Steve Kennebeck, 46, an Army sergeant who retired from the \n     military in 1997 after 20 years, said he called a special VA \n     toll-free number but was unable to learn whether he was among \n     affected veterans. His father and two brothers, veterans all, \n     are wondering, too.\n       ``We've probably all been compromised,'' said Kennebeck, \n     who lives in Washington. ``I'm angry. . . . If we had done \n     something like that in the military, we'd be punished by \n     courts-martial. We protect America, and do they protect our \n     personal information? No. It's galling. Somebody's head \n     should roll.''\n       VA officials did not return two telephone calls seeking \n     comment yesterday. VA Secretary Jim Nicholson said Monday \n     that the employee has been placed on administrative leave \n     pending investigations by the FBI, the VA inspector general \n     and local police. Nicholson said he has directed all VA \n     employees to complete a computer security training course by \n     the end of June.\n       Advocates called on the federal government to, at a \n     minimum, pay to help veterans increase monitoring of their \n     credit. ``The VFW feels strongly that the government must \n     accept responsibility for any consequences of this \n     inexcusable breach of trust with America's veteran \n     community,'' Robert E. Wallace, executive director of \n     Veterans of Foreign Wars, wrote Sen. Larry E. Craig (R-\n     Idaho), chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee. Craig has \n     indicated he will hold hearings. The House Veterans Affairs \n     Committee has scheduled a hearing for 9 a.m. tomorrow.\n       The Veterans Affairs Department provides millions of \n     veterans with health care, home loans, disability \n     compensation and a burial plot. In doing so, it collects \n     Social Security numbers, service histories and medical \n     records.\n       But the sprawling bureaucracy, with 220,000 employees \n     nationwide, has not always been the best steward of sensitive \n     data. In more than a dozen reports, audits and reviews since \n     2001, the VA inspector general has repeatedly cited the \n     department for security problems in the handling of personal \n     information.\n       In 2003, tests by IG staff showed that a hacker could gain \n     access to veterans' protected medical information from \n     outside the VA network.\n       In 2005, reviews found that access controls were not \n     consistently applied at dozens of data centers, medical \n     centers and regional offices. Recommendations included \n     ensuring that background checks are performed on\n\n[[Page S6515]]\n\n     VA and contract workers, restricting off-duty workers' access \n     to sensitive information and providing annual security \n     awareness training for employees.\n       In a report last November, acting Inspector General Jon A. \n     Wooditch wrote that many of the security concerns the IG had \n     reported on for years remained unresolved. He cited a March \n     2005 report, saying 16 recommendations still had not been \n     implemented eight months later.\n       ``We identified significant information security \n     vulnerabilities that place VA at considerable risk of . . . \n     disruption of mission-critical systems, fraudulent benefits \n     payments, fraudulent receipt of health care benefits, \n     unauthorized access to sensitive data and improper disclosure \n     of sensitive data,'' he wrote. ``The magnitude of these risks \n     is impeding VA from carrying out its mission of providing \n     health care and delivering benefits to our nation's \n     veterans.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 20, 2006]\n\n Iraq War May Add Stress for Past Vets--Trauma Disorder Claims at New \n                                  High\n\n                         (By Donna St. George)\n\n       More than 30 years after their war ended, thousands of \n     Vietnam veterans are seeking help for post-traumatic stress \n     disorder, and experts say one reason appears to be harrowing \n     images of combat in Iraq.\n       Figures from the Department of Veterans Affairs show that \n     PTSD disability-compensation cases have nearly doubled since \n     2000, to an all-time high of more than 260,000. The biggest \n     bulge has come since 2003, when war started in Iraq.\n       Experts say that, although several factors may be at work \n     in the burgeoning caseload, many veterans of past wars \n     reexperience their own trauma as they watch televised images \n     of U.S. troops in combat and read each new accounting of the \n     dead.\n       ``It so directly parallels what happened to Vietnam \n     veterans,'' said Raymond M. Scurfield of the University of \n     Southern Mississippi's Gulf Coast campus, who worked with the \n     disorder at VA for more than 20 years and has written two \n     books on the subject. ``The war has to be triggering their \n     issues. They're almost the same issues.''\n       At VA, officials said the Iraq war is probably a \n     contributing factor in the rise in cases, although they said \n     they have conducted no formal studies.\n       PTSD researcher John P. Wilson, who oversaw a small recent \n     survey of 70 veterans--nearly all from Vietnam--at Cleveland \n     State University, said 57 percent reported flashbacks after \n     watching reports about the war on television, and almost 46 \n     percent said their sleep was disrupted. Nearly 44 percent \n     said they had fallen into a depression since the war began, \n     and nearly 30 percent said they had sought counseling since \n     combat started in Iraq.\n       ``Clearly the current Iraq war, and their exposure to it, \n     created significantly increased distress for them,'' said \n     Wilson, who has done extensive research on Vietnam veterans \n     since the 1970s. ``We found very high levels of \n     intensification of their symptoms. . . . It's like a fever \n     that has gone from 99 to 104.''\n       Vietnam veterans are the vast majority of VA's PTSD \n     disability cases--more than 73 percent. Veterans of more \n     recent wars--Iraq, Afghanistan and the 1991 Persian Gulf \n     War--together made up less than 8 percent in 2005.\n       VA officials said other reasons for the surge in cases may \n     include a lessening of the stigma associated with PTSD and \n     the aging of the Vietnam generation--explanations that \n     veterans groups also suggest.\n       PTSD is better understood than it once was, said Paul \n     Sullivan, director of programs for the group Veterans for \n     America. ``The veterans are more willing to accept a \n     diagnosis of PTSD,'' he said, ``and the VA is more willing to \n     make it''\n       In addition, as Vietnam veterans near retirement age, \n     ``they have more time to think, instead of focusing on making \n     a living all the time, and for some this is not necessarily a \n     good thing,'' said Rick Weidman, executive director for \n     policy and government affairs at Vietnam Veterans of America.\n       Max Cleland, a former U.S. senator from Georgia and onetime \n     head of the VA who was left a triple amputee by the Vietnam \n     War, said the convergence of age and the Iraq war has created \n     problems for many of his fellow veterans--as well as for \n     himself.\n       ``As we Vietnam veterans get older, we are more \n     vulnerable,'' he said. When the war started in 2003, he said, \n     ``it was like going back in time--it was like 1968 again.''\n       Now he goes for therapy at Walter Reed Army Medical Center \n     and is wary of news from Iraq. ``I don't read a newspaper,'' \n     he said. ``I don't watch television. It's all a trigger. . . \n     . This war has triggered me, and it has triggered Vietnam \n     veterans all over America.''\n       PTSD has become a volatile topic lately, with some skeptics \n     questioning whether the rise in claims is driven by over \n     diagnosis or by financial motives. A report last week from \n     the Institute of Medicine, part of the National Academies, \n     concluded that ``PTSD is a well characterized medical \n     disorder'' for which ``all veterans deployed to a war zone \n     are at risk.''\n       VA's growing PTSD caseload became an issue last August, \n     when the agency announced a new review of 72,000 PTSD \n     compensation cases, expressing concerns about errors and a \n     lack of evidence. That probe was dropped after a sample of \n     2,100 cases turned up no instances of fraud.\n       Still, some experts are not convinced that the Iraq war has \n     driven up the caseload. ``I'm skeptical that it accounts for \n     a broad swath of this phenomenon,'' said psychiatrist Sally \n     Satel, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise \n     Institute. ``These men have had deaths in their families, \n     they had all kinds of tragedies over 30 years that surely \n     affected them emotionally but they coped with.''\n       Although a small percentage of veterans might be deeply \n     affected, she said, she doubts ``they have become chronically \n     disabled because of it''\n       Around the country, many veterans dwell on the similarities \n     between the wars in Vietnam and Iraq: guerrilla tactics, \n     deadly explosives, fallen comrades, divisive politics. The \n     way they see it, ``Iraq is Vietnam without water,'' Weidman \n     said.\n       ``We have people who have symptoms that they haven't had in \n     a long time,'' said Randy Barnes, 65, who works in the Kansas \n     City offices of Vietnam Veterans of America. For some, ``the \n     nightmares and flashbacks have been very hard to deal with,'' \n     he said. Group therapy sessions are ``much more crowded,'' he \n     said, ``with Vietnam veterans particularly, but now also with \n     the Iraq and Afghanistan veterans.''\n       Barnes served as a combat medic in Vietnam from 1968 to \n     1969 and went into treatment only in the late 1990s. By the \n     time the Iraq war started, he said, he felt steadier--but \n     then his symptoms ramped up again.\n       ``Depending on what I saw or heard that day or read, I \n     would have night problems--nightmares, night sweats,'' he \n     said. Sometimes, he said, he would roll out of bed and wake \n     up crawling on the floor, ``seeking safety, I guess.''\n       A study published in February by VA experts showed that \n     veterans under VA care experienced notable mental distress \n     after the war started and as it intensified. While younger \n     veterans, ages 18 to 44, showed the greatest reactions to the \n     war, ``Vietnam era VA patients reported particularly high \n     levels'' of distress consistently, the study reported.\n       Powerful images of war have revived combat trauma in the \n     past. ``Traumatized people overreact to things that remind \n     them of their original trauma,'' said Scurfield, the PTSD \n     expert in Mississippi.\n       When the movie ``Saving Private Ryan'' was released, World \n     War II sought mental health help in great numbers, said \n     Wilson of Cleveland State. ``It rekindled it all,'' he said.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, earlier today I was given the opportunity \nto speak on the Senate floor about the constitutional amendment that is \nbefore us. Time ran out before I was able to conclude my remarks. I \nwould like to do that at this time.\n  One of the heroes of the Vietnam war in which I served was a former \nPOW named Jim Warner. I would like to close my comments today with his \nwords. It is an extensive quote, but I want to quote all of his letter.\n  Here is what he said:\n\n       In March of 1973, when we were released from a prisoner of \n     war camp in North Vietnam, we were flown to Clark Air Force \n     base in the Philippines. As I stepped out of the aircraft, I \n     looked up and saw the flag. I caught my breath, then, as \n     tears filled my eyes. I saluted it. I never loved my country \n     more than at that moment. Although I have received the Silver \n     Star Medal and two Purple Hearts, they were nothing compared \n     with the gratitude I felt then for having been allowed to \n     serve the cause of freedom.\n       Because the mere sight of the flag meant so much to me when \n     I saw it for the first time, after five and one-half years, \n     It hurts me to see other Americans willfully desecrate it. \n     But I have been in a Communist prison where I looked into the \n     pit of hell. I cannot compromise with those who want to \n     punish the flag burners. Let me explain myself.\n       Early in the imprisonment, the Communists told us that we \n     did not have to stay there. If we would only admit that we \n     were wrong, if we would only apologize, we could be released \n     early. If we did not, we would be punished. A handful \n     accepted. Most did not. In our minds, early release under \n     those conditions would amount to a betrayal of our comrades, \n     of our country, and of our flag.\n       Because we would not say the words they wanted us to say, \n     they made our lives wretched. Most of us were tortured and \n     some of my comrades died. I was tortured for most of the \n     summer of 1969. I developed beriberi from malnutrition. I had \n     long bouts of dysentery. I was infested with intestinal \n     parasites. I spent 13 months in solitary confinement. Was our \n     cause worth all of this? Yes, it was worth all this and more.\n       I remember one interrogation where I was shown a photograph \n     of some Americans protesting the war by burning a flag. \n     `There,' the officer said. `People in your country protest \n     against your cause. That proves you are wrong.'\n       `No,' I said. `That proves I am right. In my country, we \n     are not afraid of freedom, even if it means that people \n     disagree with us.' The officer was on his feet in an instant, \n     his face purple with rage. He smashed his fist onto the table \n     and screamed at me to shut up. While he was ranting, I was \n     astonished to see pain, compounded by fear, in his eyes. I \n     have never forgotten that look, nor have I forgotten the \n     satisfaction I felt at using his tool, the picture of the \n     burning flag, against him.\n\n[[Page S6516]]\n\n       We don't need to amend the Constitution in order to punish \n     those who burn our flag. They burn the flag because they hate \n     America and they are afraid of freedom. What better way to \n     hurt them than with the subversive idea of freedom? Spread \n     freedom. . . . Don't be afraid of freedom.\n\n  Those, my friends, are the words of former POW Jim Warner.\n  There are many issues in the Senate that need our attention today--a \npath forward in Iraq, our large and growing dependence on foreign oil, \nthe threat of global warming, the skyrocketing cost of health care, \njust to name a few. These are pressing issues which demand action not \njust from the Congress but from the President, too--not in the next \nadministration, not next year, now. Instead, we are spending this week \ndebating a constitutional amendment--however well intentioned--that is \ntruly, in my judgment, not needed in America today.\n  Later this week, Senator Bennett and others will offer legislation \nthat would criminalize flag desecration under specific circumstances \nwithout having to amend our Constitution. That measure would prohibit \nburning or destroying the flag with the intent to incite or produce \nimminent violence or a breach of the peace or damaging a flag that \nbelongs to the United States or another person on U.S. lands.\n  Senator Durbin will seek to add to that legislation an amendment that \nwould prohibit groups from demonstrating or protesting near a funeral \nof someone who died serving in our Armed Forces. This is in response to \nan extremist group that has been traveling the country--it came to \nDelaware--and disrupting funeral services for our fallen soldiers, \nmaking outrageous claims about our country. Their behavior is \nreprehensible. It desecrates our flag and everything it stands for. By \nGod, it should be illegal--that kind of behavior--and the Durbin \namendment will make it illegal.\n  We could take up both of these measures today and pass them, I \nbelieve, without objection. We could penalize flag desecration to the \nfullest extent possible without jeopardizing the values inherent in our \nConstitution. In my view, this approach is a balanced one in that it \nallows us to maintain our reverence both for our flag that we love and \nfor the Constitution we revere.\n  As I said earlier in my remarks this morning, I still get a lump in \nmy throat when I sing our national anthem or say the Pledge of \nAllegiance to our flag and take a moment to truly consider what our \nflag stands for and the sacrifices made in its honor. It is a symbol of \nAmerica. I love it now more than I ever have. But behind that symbol is \nour Constitution. It is the foundation on which our country has been \nbuilt and endures today. It is what guarantees us the freedoms and the \nliberties that make this country of ours great. We should not amend \nthat living document lightly, and we should not change it when we can \nfind another way.\n  My friends, let's find that other way this week. Let's maintain our \nreverence for the flag and for our Constitution.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask that I be permitted to use 6 minutes \nof my party's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the proposed \nconstitutional amendment.\n  Since World War II, I have been involved directly or indirectly in 13 \nwars and conflicts: Korea, Vietnam, the Dominican Republic, Desert One, \nGrenada, Lebanon, Panama, the Persian Gulf war, Somalia, Haiti, \nYugoslavia, Afghanistan, and now Iraq.\n  In all these wars and conflicts, there are several things in common. \nFirst, American lives were lost and many young Americans were wounded \nand will bear scars for the rest of their lives, and we must not \ndishonor their memories by abandoning the freedoms for which they \nsacrificed.\n  Second, in every war, great speeches are made and delivered \nenergizing our citizens to defend our unique American freedoms \ncontained within the Bill of Rights. I can still hear some of those \nstirring words.\n  During the Second World War, very close friends of mine were lost. \nMuch blood was shed to preserve every American's constitutional \nfreedoms.\n  To be clear, I have no patience with those who defile our flag. It is \nunpatriotic and deeply offensive to those who serve or who have served \nin uniform. It angers me to see symbols of our country set on fire. \nThis objectionable expression is obscene, it is painful, it is \nunpatriotic, but I believe Americans gave their lives in many wars to \nmake certain that all Americans have a right to express themselves, \neven those who harbor hateful thoughts.\n  Our country is unique because our dissidents have a voice. Protecting \nthis freedom of expression, even when it hurts the most, is a true test \nof our dedication to democracy.\n  As a commissioned military officer and as a U.S. Senator, I took an \noath to uphold and defend the Constitution. As a Senator, I have become \naccustomed to being insulted and condemned by people who disagree with \nme. I have been castigated for having cast votes that some call \nunpatriotic or un-American. I believe that my actions were patriotic \nand American, but those who criticize me have a right to disagree and \nexpress their disagreement.\n  It is not always easy to serve the country with a Bill of Rights that \ndefends the rights of those who would defile our national symbol. While \nI take offense at disrespect to the flag, I nonetheless believe it is \nmy continued duty as a veteran, as an American citizen, and as a United \nStates Senator to defend the constitutional right of protesters to use \nthe flag in nonviolent speech.\n  For over 200 years, our Bill of Rights has endured. It proclaims the \nGovernment of the United States is limited in its powers, and this \nsacred document continues to instruct and inspire people throughout the \nworld. And for the last 200 years, despite repeated efforts to tamper \nwith this document, we have always found the strength necessary to live \nwithin these limits.\n  So today we must look inside ourselves once again and find the \nstrength to affirm our commitment to the precious liberties enshrined \nin the Bill of Rights.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have great respect for the Senator from \nHawaii, for his service as a veteran, as well as his service in this \nbody, but I couldn't disagree more.\n  Our Founders used the word ``speech.'' They didn't say ``expression'' \nor ``expressive behavior.'' They used the word ``speech'' very \ncritically. It was discussed in the documents: What word will we use in \nthe Bill of Rights in this first amendment?\n  They chose the word ``speech'' because they meant speech. They didn't \nmean behavior. They meant speech.\n  I think it is real important for the American people to understand \nwhat this debate is all about. It is not about burning the flag. It is \nabout restoring the balance of the three branches of Government, and \nthat when one of the three becomes imbalanced, that we have the right \nto restore that balance. Our Founders were wise in that regard\n\n[[Page S6517]]\n\nto give us this vehicle of amending the Constitution.\n  We can talk about the flag all we want, but the real debate here is, \nwhen an overwhelming majority of Americans agree with this and all 50 \nState legislatures have passed requests that we do this, why we don't \ndo this? The only way we have to balance the judiciary with the \nlegislative branch is to do it in a manner that represents the will of \nthe people as prescribed by our Founders.\n  Seven new Republican Senators were elected in 2004, and if there was \nan issue that dominated that debate more than anything, it was, what \nkind of judges are we going to put on the courts? Are we going to \nconfirm judges who take what they want, twist the Constitution into \nwhat they believe, and change the basics of how we operate in this \ncountry or are we going to put judges on the courts who understand that \nthey have a very limited role to interpret the Constitution, interpret \nthe treaties, and interpret the statutes of this country?\n  The reason we were sent here, the seven of us, the vast majority of \nthe impact of that election, was to have an impact on what kinds of \njudges we were going to put on the courts. This is that same debate \ncoming from a different angle. Do we want a 5-to-4 decision where five \nMembers of the Court determine and twist what the real words of our \nConstitution say--speech, not behavior; it says ``speech,'' not \nbehavior, not expressive conduct; it says ``speech''--and do we want to \nallow that to continue to be twisted or do we want to reserve the right \nfor Congress to go through the method that our Founders allowed to \nbring about a constitutional amendment that says we have the right to \ncontrol whether somebody can do that.\n  To vote against this amendment will limit the ability of this body to \nhold on to its balanced share of one-third of the power of this \nGovernment. This is about restoring the power of this body and the \nHouse to, in fact, represent what the people in this country want in an \noverwhelming majority in all 50 States.\n  It is not about burning the flag. It is about reestablishing the \nproper role of the balance of the three branches that run this \ncountry--the executive, the judiciary, and the legislative.\n  We are going to miss a great opportunity if we don't do this. It will \ndo two things: One, it will reestablish the power, but it will send a \nsignal that when judges take an oath, they have to follow the oath and \nthe oath is not to determine what they think is best based on what they \nbelieve. Their oath is to follow the Constitution, not change it but \nfollow it; and No. 2, interpret the statutes and interpret the \ntreaties.\n  We have to reestablish a balance. This resolution is about \nreestablishing that balance and sending the message that we are serious \nthat judges take their oath seriously, that they don't get to play \ngames with what they would like but they, in fact, have to uphold their \noath. They also have to follow what the Constitution says, and the \nConstitution says the same thing as their oath. They don't get the \nprivilege of deciding what they want. They have the privilege of only \ndeciding what the Constitution says, what the statutes say, and what \nthe treaties say.\n  I remind the Members of this body that our Founders put the word \n``speech'' in the first amendment on purpose. They didn't put the words \n``expressive behavior.'' They used the word ``speech,'' and we ought to \nestablish the right of the Congress to establish within itself the \nright to do what the American people want and to follow the \nConstitution. That is what this is about.\n  There have been a lot of statements made about what would you do with \na flag; what about a bathing suit? The way you judge what is a flag is \nwhat you drape over the coffin of one of our fallen soldiers. That is \nhow you judge what it is. That is what it means. You can't define what \nit is other than the value of service and sacrifice that is part of the \nheritage of this country. To say we cannot preserve the value of that \nand bring back our constitutional responsibility to do that--No. 1, \nwhich does follow the Constitution and, No. 2, is the desired will of \nthis country--means that we won't stand up to the obligations of our \noffice, and we ought to be very serious about it as we do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today in full support of S.J. \nRes. 12, the flag desecration resolution introduced by Senator Hatch. \nThe Senate has given this bill adequate consideration and it is now \ntime to pass it and send it to the States for ratification.\n  I have heard a lot of critics of the flag amendment incorrectly \ncharacterize it as stifling free speech. Nothing could be further from \nthe truth. First, the amendment itself does not prohibit anything. The \nconstitutional amendment we are considering today restores to Congress \nthe power to protect the flag--a power the Congress freely exercised \nuntil 1989, when the Supreme Court handed down 5 to 4 decision in Texas \nv. Johnson. This decision struck down a flag protection statute in \nTexas, and effectively invalidated similar statutes in 48 States and \nthe District of Columbia, as well as the Federal statute. In 1990, in \nanother 5 to 4 decision, the Court struck down a revised Federal \nstatute.\n  The Court's decision in Texas v. Johnson was notable for a powerful \ndissent authored by Justice Stevens. I would note that Justice Stevens \nprovides consistently one of the most liberal votes on the Court. \nJustice Stevens found that neither the States nor Congress had acted \nimproperly in passing the statutes in question. He was on the mark in \nhis dissent when he said:\n\n       The case has nothing to do with disagreeable ideas; it \n     involves disagreeable conduct that, in my opinion, diminishes \n     the value of an important national asset.\n\n  Justice Stevens is absolutely correct in recognizing that a \nprohibition on certain forms of conduct is a power long held by \nCongress and the States and in no way infringes on the right of any \nindividual to express an idea. He went on to say:\n\n       Had he chosen to spray-paint--or perhaps convey with a \n     motion picture projector--his message of dissatisfaction on \n     the facade of the Lincoln Memorial, there would be no \n     question about the power of the Government to prohibit his \n     means of expression. The prohibition would be supported by \n     the legitimate interest in preserving the quality of an \n     important national asset.\n\n  Then-Chief Justice Rehnquist also questioned the communicative value \nin desecrating the flag, saying that such conduct ``is most likely to \nbe indulged in not to express any particular idea, but to antagonize \nothers.''\n  Prior to these rulings, Congress, with the support of a majority of \nthe American people, had the power to protect our Nation's symbol. \nRespect for the flag is not something that falls along ideological \nlines or party affiliation; it is shared by Americans from all walks of \nlife. In these polarized times, the flag remains a unifying symbol.\n  Last month, as chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on the \nConstitution, I chaired a markup of this bill. We had an energized \ndebate, and passed the amendment with a bipartisan 6-to-3 majority. \nTwo-thirds of the membership of my subcommittee not only supported the \namendment but were, and are, proud cosponsors.\n  I would like to thank my good friend and ranking member, Senator Russ \nFeingold for his cooperation in scheduling a markup. He doesn't support \nthe amendment, but I know he believes amending the Constitution is a \nvery serious matter, and I appreciate his cooperation in having a fair \nand honest debate. I would also like to thank Senator Feinstein. She is \none of the strongest supporters of this amendment and is also a member \nof the Constitution Subcommittee. I commend her for ignoring powerful \nspecial interest groups and diligently fighting for what's right.\n  We should be very careful in considering amendments to the U.S. \nConstitution. It is not something that should ever be taken lightly, \nbut the Court has left us with few options. It is unfortunate that we \nhave to consider this amendment, but I do believe that in light of the \nSupreme Court's decisions it is the appropriate action.\n  The amendment has broad bipartisan support here in the Senate, and is \nsupported by Americans from both ends of the political spectrum. Poll \nafter poll indicates that the people of this country want their flag \nprotected. I have been contacted by numerous veterans\n\n[[Page S6518]]\n\ngroups from my home State of Kansas, as well as across the country \nvoicing strong support for this amendment. We ask a lot from our men \nand women in uniform. They sacrifice their safety and risk their lives \nso that each of us can remain free in this great Republic. Their \ndefense of the principles and liberties embodied in the red, white, and \nblue preserve the freedoms enumerated in the Constitution.\n  Passing this amendment and sending it to the States allows for the \nAmerican people to have their voices heard on this important issue. The \nHouse passed the flag amendment by a two-thirds majority vote last \nyear, and it is now our turn to do the right thing and give the States \nand the people of this great Nation the opportunity to decide whether \nto grant protection to our national symbol. If ratified by three-\nfourths of the States, then we can debate an appropriate statute \nconcerning treatment of the flag.\n  There is a lot of misinformation regarding this amendment that should \nbe cleared up. If ratified, the text of the Constitution would not \nprohibit flag burning. The amendment states:\n\n       The Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical \n     desecration of the flag of the United States.\n\n  Even if the amendment passes, the Congress may decide not to prohibit \nflag desecration. But we will have corrected a wrong decision by the \nSupreme Court.\n  Article V to the Constitution does not give nine unelected Justices \nthe right to amend our founding document. This power rests solely in \nthe democratic process. Restoring this power to the people and their \nelected representatives in Congress preserves this process. Protecting \nthe integrity of our national symbol should not be left to a handful of \nunelected judges. Why would any Member of this body vote to limit our \npower and expand the power of the Court?\n  The Founding Fathers wisely devised a process for the people through \ntheir elected representatives--not the courts--to amend the \nConstitution. It is our duty as elected Members of Congress to exercise \nthis constitutionally granted power when necessary and appropriate. \nJustice is not served when we remain silent and allow unaccountable \njudges to exercise this power for us. If, as Members on both sides the \naisle repeatedly claim, we truly oppose judicial activism, we should \nsend this amendment to the States for ratification.\n  I am proud to have cosponsored this amendment in every Congress since \nI became a Member, and to have consistently cast my vote in support \neach time the bill has made it to the floor. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill, so that the American people can choose whether or \nnot to bestow protection to their flag. There is no symbol that has the \npower to unify us like the flag, which is why a majority of Americans \ncontinue to support this amendment. It is time to restore the \ntraditional meaning of the first amendment and send the flag \ndesecration resolution to the States for ratification. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for this important amendment.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oklahoma for his great work \non this amendment. This legislation passed the Constitution \nSubcommittee 6 to 3. It passed the full Judiciary Committee and is now \nready for this body to vote, and we need to have a positive vote on it.\n  I flew in to Washington today. There were cloudy skies, but one could \nstill see the monuments when flying in. The beauty of the monuments \nnever ceases to strike me. Whether it is the White House, the \nWashington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, National Cathedral, there \nare just certain landscape features one looks at.\n  When you are flying in on the so-called river run that the pilots so \noften do, you get to see these monuments, and it is just so striking.\n  I was preparing for this debate and thinking about the Lincoln \nMemorial. What if somebody today, yesterday, or some other time had \ntaken spray paint and sprayed on the Lincoln Memorial: ``We want \nfreedom'' or ``Death to tyrants'' or ``Down with the flag''? Let's say \nthey wrote that in big spray paint on the Lincoln Memorial and defaced \nthe memorial and then was caught and was brought to trial and claimed: \nWait a minute, I have a first amendment right to say what I want to \nsay, and I believe it is important that I say it anywhere, and I want \nto say it on the Lincoln Memorial. I want to make my message known, and \nI am going to spray-paint it all over here; this is free speech, and I \nought to be able to do that and this is the place to do it, and Lincoln \nwould approve of that; he believed in free speech, so he wouldn't mind \nthat the memorial was sprayed upon, that it was defaced.\n  We would all recognize that as being something wrong, violating the \nlaw, and something there should be a law against.\n  We don't have a problem with a person standing on the Lincoln \nMemorial and shouting at the top of his lungs for as long as he wants \nwhatever he wants to say--if it is about the war in Iraq, if it is \nabout the President, if it is about somebody in the Senate, if it is \nabout myself, if it is about the Chair, if it is about anything he \nwants. We don't have any problem with that. But if he defaces the \nmemorial, we do.\n  It is interesting, that was the dissent Justice Stevens used in the \nTexas v. Johnson case. He made that same point. We have no problem with \na person speaking on the Lincoln Memorial. We have a problem with him \ndefacing the Lincoln Memorial. We have no problem with people speaking \nagainst the flag. We have a problem with them defacing the flag.\n  Justice Stevens in his dissent--which I think was rightly said--said:\n\n       Had he chosen to spray paint or perhaps convey with a \n     motion picture projector his message of dissatisfaction on \n     the facade of the Lincoln Memorial, there would be no \n     question about the power of Government to prohibit this means \n     of expression. The prohibition will be supported by the \n     legitimate interests in preserving the quality of an \n     important national asset.\n\n  That is what we are talking about today: preserving the quality of an \nimportant national asset that people follow into battle, that we have \nhad and honored for years and years, and until recently the court has \nheld up as saying: Yes, this is something that should be protected and \nis protected by the laws of the land, and these laws are appropriate \nand are not limitations on free speech.\n  I think if you follow this court ruling, where does it end? If you \nsay actions are speech, wouldn't you have a legitimate objective in \ndefacing the Lincoln Memorial, particularly if it was some form of \npolitical free speech that you wanted to express and put forward?\n  We have held many hearings on this topic. This is not a complicated \nissue. It is about whether we are going to have some authority and \nability to be able to limit and to be able to honor and to uphold \nsomething so precious as our American flag. I think we should do that. \nI think because of the people who follow this flag and because we are a \nnation of symbols, and symbols are what unite us, and because of the \nwords and thought that are conveyed by this flag, we should be able to \nuphold this mighty national asset. I think it is important that we be \nallowed to do that.\n  I have had a chance to speak on this at length in committee. I have \ncarried the amendment in our subcommittee. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment and let the States vote on it. Let the States \ndecide what they would choose to do.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to make a few comments on the \nbill before us. I have heard a great deal of discussion and, as always, \nthere should be a lot of discussion, different ideas about it, the idea \nof protecting free speech, and none of us disagree with that. I think \nthe difference here is the fact that the flag represents our right and \nour freedom for free speech as well as all of our other freedoms. So I \nam proud and honored to be one of the 59 original cosponsors of the \nflag protection amendment.\n  Having served in the Marine Corps, I stood before the flag and \nunderstood that it represented the things that we stand for. It \nrepresented the freedoms we have. It represented the things that we \nsacrifice for. I believe it should receive special protection because \nthat is what it symbolizes to the citizens of the United States.\n  I understand there are concerns about limiting free speech. This \namendment does not limit speech; it simply gives Congress the authority \nto prohibit physical desecration of the\n\n[[Page S6519]]\n\nflag. To me, that is pretty easy to determine. It is something we \nshould protect. It is something that we have given a great deal to \nprotect. It is symbolic of the things that mean so much to us.\n  Since the Supreme Court decision that said desecrating the flag is \nprotected speech, there has been an overwhelming amount of public \nsupport to protect the flag. All 50 States have passed resolutions \ncalling for Congress to pass a flag amendment.\n  I understand that amending the Constitution should not be taken \nlightly, but burning or defacing or trampling the flag sends the wrong \nmessage to people who have given so much, including their lives, for \nthe defense of this country, so certainly that should not be taken \nlightly.\n  Throughout history, in times of war, peace, and uncertainty, our \nNation always turns to the flag as a sign of resolve, as a sign of \ncommitment, as a sign of strength. After the attacks of September 11, \nour Nation unfurled the flag at the Pentagon and raised it from the \nrubble at Ground Zero. It is a symbol of national unity and identity. \nThis symbol needs to be held in the highest regard. Generations of \nAmerican soldiers have died under the flag and the ideals it stands \nfor. The flag is a strong symbol for those who fought in wartime.\n  The American flag is a national asset. Just as it is unlawful to \ndesecrate the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, and the graves \nat Arlington, it should be unlawful to desecrate the flag. Aren't there \nsome things like symbols of freedom that should rise above politics? It \nseems to me that they should.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment so we can send it \nto the States for ratification and ultimately let the people of America \ndecide.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment to \nallow the U.S. Congress to protect the American flag.\n  I was elected 2 years ago, in the most recent election. I ran on a \ncampaign of three basic promises and commitments to the people of \nGeorgia: The first was to support the President and our men and women \nin harm's way in the war on terror. The second was to work diligently \nfor strong fiscal accountability on behalf of the Congress. And the \nthird was to vote in favor of confirming the judges appointed by the \nPresident of the United States to the Federal bench. With those \npromises, I made the statement that I really felt as though the \ndivision of powers of our Constitution was sound, and that it was \nabsolutely important for judges to interpret the law, not to make the \nlaw.\n  This amendment has been said by some to be a violation of the first \namendment. This amendment has nothing to do with speech or expression. \nIt has everything to do with protecting our flag and allowing the \nCongress to write those laws that would prohibit physical desecration \nof our flag.\n  Unlike some, I do not believe the flag is an inanimate object. I \nbelieve it is a living symbol for which our men and women in harm's way \nhave fought for over two centuries.\n  Just a month ago, I went to Normandy. I went to Bellewood. I went to \nthe Netherlands and Margraten. I went to Belgium and Carthage in \nNorthern Africa. We did seven ceremonies in 6 days at seven American \ncemeteries, cemeteries where tens of thousands of Americans are buried, \nhaving paid the ultimate sacrifice in World War I and World War II. \nThey died to protect the first amendment. But if those in the graves \ncould come back and speak, I don't think a one would say they died to \nhave the flag they fought for desecrated.\n  The courts have also been inconsistent in this case in my judgment \nabout the first amendment and expression. The court, in 1989, in Texas \nv. Johnson, and in 1990 in the case of the United States v. Eichman, \nruled that burning the flag was protected by the first amendment. I \nfind it ironic that in 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the \nVirginia case, Virginia v. Black, that the burning of a cross in \nsomeone's front yard was not expression and, therefore, the Virginia \nlaw banning it was upheld.\n  I did a little research on that case which led me to find out that \nthe District of Columbia has that law, the State of Georgia has that \nlaw, and many States in the United States have that law, which says the \nterrible act of desecrating a cross and burning it is protected--is \nfine for the States to do that. In fact, I read a little bit about \nClarence Thomas's opinion written in that 2003 case, and I want to \nshare his remarks because it applies directly to my point on protecting \nthe flag and not allowing its desecration. Justice Thomas said:\n\n       This statute prohibits only conduct, not expression. ust as \n     one cannot burn down someone's house to make a political \n     point and then seek refuge in the First Amendment, those who \n     hate cannot terrorize and intimidate to make their point.\n\n  I don't think it can be said more succinctly or more clearly.\n  The amendment that is to be voted on by this Senate, hopefully \nsometime today or tomorrow, is an amendment that does nothing to \nprohibit the speech of anyone but does everything to protect the flag \nfrom being desecrated. I think those brave men and women who died for \nthis country would agree with that, I agree with that, and I think the \npeople of Georgia agree with that. I urge my colleagues to vote in \nfavor of passage of the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, how much time do we have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the proposition before \nus and on the importance of protecting the American flag. The American \nflag is a unique symbol in the Nation's consciousness. America, unlike \nmany countries, actually had a birthday. There was a day when the \nColonies became States and the States became a nation and they were \norganized explicitly around certain beliefs about human dignity and \nfreedom: the belief that people have certain inalienable rights that \ninhere in them as human beings and that because of those rights the \nGovernment is the servant and not the master of the people. It is also \na nation that cherishes diversity but balances against that, unity. It \nis no accident that the national motto is ``out of the many, the one.''\n  We are not a country with a monarchy. We rebelled against a monarchy. \nWe are not a country with an established religion. We rebelled against \nthat as well. We are a country with only a few unifying symbols, chief \namong which is the flag. That is why it is so uniquely important to \nAmerica's conception of itself to protect the flag. In protecting the \nflag, we are affirming the basic beliefs of the country.\n  I believe that there is in the Constitution a narrow power on the \npart of the States and the Congress to protect the flag from public \ndesecration. In passing this amendment, if the Senate chooses to do it, \nwe will simply affirm those underlying ideals. We are not saying you \ncan't criticize those ideals--you can. You can attack them. You can \nattack the flag if you want. But there ought to be a power to protect \nthe flag from public desecration, and I think the amendment comes down \nsimply to that proposition:\n  How much do you value the flag as a symbol of what this Nation has \nstood for and what the people of this country have sacrificed for and \nin some cases have died for?\n  There are arguments that have been raised on the floor against the \namendment. One of them is that we should not amend the Constitution. \nThe Supreme Court has amended the Constitution. Until recently, it was \nthe common understanding that this power existed. There were 48 States \nthat had laws against the desecration of the flag. The Supreme Court \nsaid they were unconstitutional. In effect, the Court updated or \namended the traditional understanding of the Constitution to say that. \nWhatever you think of the Court's power to amend the Constitution or \nupdate it according to the opinions of the Justices, surely the people\n\n[[Page S6520]]\n\nought to have the power to amend the Constitution.\n  If the Court can do it, the people ought to be able do it.\n  That is another basic American ideal--the right of the people to \ngovern themselves, to decide for themselves what their own organic law \nsays. If the people are to have their will carried out in this respect, \nthe only way they have left to do it is by amending the Constitution. \nIf you say we should not amend the Constitution under these \ncircumstances, you are saying, in effect, that the courts can change \nthe Constitution when they think it is important to do it, and the \npeople have no response. They cannot pass a statute because the Court \nwould say it is unconstitutional, and they cannot pass a constitutional \namendment because so many in this body say they should never amend \ntheir own Constitution.\n  Another argument against the amendment is that it regulates \nexpression. It does not. Burning the flag is an act. It is an act with \nexpressive overtones, surely, so we should be careful before doing it, \nbut it is an act, and it is fully within the tradition of the first \namendment to allow the regulation of actions that have speech \novertones. It was only a few years ago that this body passed \ncomprehensive campaign finance reform that most certainly regulated not \njust acts but expressions. According to that legislation, it is \nunlawful for grassroots groups to sponsor political advertisement in \nthe last 60 days of an election that mentions the name of a candidate. \nI cannot think of anything more closely related to the core of what the \nfirst amendment was passed to protect, yet the Court said that was \nconstitutional. If it is permissible to regulate speech in that \ncontext, why is it not permissible to regulate action that has speech \novertones?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for another 2 minutes to \nfinish my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TALENT. Why is it not permissible to regulate something that is \nclearly an act that strikes at the heart of the American consciousness \nand that leaves unregulated a vast area of expression?\n  I would daresay, if the average American decided to participate in \nthe political process and try to get his or her views out, they might \nvery well join a grassroots group and get involved in a campaign. Yet \nit is evidently consistent with the first amendment, according to the \nCourt, to regulate that, yet not consistent to prohibit a particular \naction that has one narrow area of expressive overtones.\n  We should at least understand what this debate is about. It is about \nhow much you value the flag. I do not begrudge anybody their views \nabout expression or the Constitution or the role of this body in \nregulating the one or amending the other. But I believe this debate is \nabout how great a significance you attach to the flag of the United \nStates. I believe it is important. People have fought under it. They \nhave died for it. There are literally billions of people around the \nworld who see the flag as a symbol for all that is good about their \nhopes for the future.\n  I believe it is important that we have this debate. I hope the Senate \nwill think clearly and deeply and thoughtfully and not on a partisan or \npolitical basis and decide it is consistent with America's traditions \nand that it will sustain the balance between diversity and unity for us \nto pass this amendment and protect our flag.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have listened to this debate today and \nyesterday. I have heard the heartfelt sentiments of my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle about this flag. I think everyone following \nthis debate has the same strong feelings about this flag and what it \nsymbolizes.\n  Today, Senator Dan Inouye, my colleague from the State of Hawaii, \nspoke. There probably is no one better qualified to come to the Senate \nfloor and speak to this issue. Senator Dan Inouye, a veteran of World \nWar II, lost his arm in combat and was decorated with the Congressional \nMedal of Honor for the bravery and valor he showed in that conflict. He \nwent on to serve his Nation again in the U.S. Congress and came to the \nfloor today to speak from the heart about what that flag means to him. \nOne would think that a man like Senator Inouye, more than any other who \nserves in the Senate, would understand the importance of that flag to \nour men and women in uniform and to all of us who, from the moment we \nwere old enough, learned the Pledge of Allegiance and stood up in front \nof our classrooms and said that flag means something special.\n  Today before us is an opportunity to do something for that flag, and \nI believe we should seize that opportunity. But I think what has been \nproposed by the other side, the idea of amending our Constitution, is \nnot necessary.\n  Stop and reflect for a moment. Since 1791, when James Madison, Thomas \nJefferson, and the Founding Fathers crafted the words of our Bill of \nRights, they have stood as a sacred document in this country. They have \nguided us through good times and bad. They have given us our moral \ncompass as a nation. They have inspired others to follow that wording \nso carefully crafted in building their own constitutions and their own \nnations. It is, indeed, a sacred document.\n  Some have come to the Senate floor in the last several days and \nsuggested it is time to change the Bill of Rights. It is time for the \nfirst time in the history of the United States of America to change the \nwords crafted by our Founding Fathers.\n  I have said it before and I will repeat it now, when it comes to \nchanging this Constitution, I approach that task with great humility. I \nlike to think I have some skills, perhaps at writing or speaking, but \nif you are asking me to write words to put in that Constitution, words \nthat would change what Madison, Jefferson, and the Founding Fathers \nintended to be our basic rights as Americans, I come to that task with \ngreat humility.\n  But some of my colleagues do not. In fact, over the last 15 years we \nhave had 1,000 amendments proposed to the Constitution. There was a \ntime in the Senate Judiciary Committee not long ago when the chairman \nscheduled two constitutional amendments to be considered on the same \nday. I took exception to that. I objected to one of them and I argued \nthen, and I still believe, that for all that is holy in America, we \nshould not amend the Constitution more than once a day.\n  Today we are facing the second constitutional amendment this month \nproposed by the Republican side of the aisle. I think it is \nunfortunate. I wish my colleagues approached this with the same sense \nof humility which I think most Americans would if facing this \nchallenge. The obvious question is this: If we love this flag, if we \nrespect this flag, if it is a symbol for our Nation, how should we show \nthat respect? We do it in so many ways, from the Pledge of Allegiance \nto our national anthem, saluting it as it passes in parade or putting \nyour hand over your heart. We do it in ways large and small.\n  But what about those who desecrate that flag? What about those who \nengage in hateful conduct toward that flag to protest some action by \nthe United States or for whatever reason? What should we do with those \npeople? According to those supporting a constitutional amendment, we \nshould show our hatred for their conduct by amending the Bill of Rights \nfor the first time in the history of the United States of America. I \ndisagree. I disagree. I believe there is a way to protect that flag \nwithout defiling our Constitution. There is a way to show our love of \nthat symbol of our great Nation, not at the expense of that sacred \ndocument which has guided us from the beginning. What I am proposing at \nthe end of my statement today is an amendment. It is an amendment that \nis being offered on a bipartisan basis. It is an amendment that will \nmake it unnecessary to amend the Constitution of the United States. It \nis an amendment which establishes that it will be a crime to desecrate \nthat flag. We spell out the circumstances that would make it a crime.\n  The Supreme Court has not said that you have to amend the \nConstitution to protect that flag--just the opposite.\n  In the United States v. Eichman case in 1990, the Supreme Court \nexpressly recognized that while citizens have a free speech right to \nexpress their political dissent by burning the flag, the Government may \npunish flag-burning under certain circumstances.\n\n[[Page S6521]]\n\n  In a unanimous decision in 1992--in R.A.V. v. the City of St. Paul--\nthe Court explained that although a law prohibiting individuals from \ndishonoring the flag is not content neutral, the Government may punish \nflag-burning in a content neutral manner.\n  Stripping away the constitutional language, what the Court has said \nis this Congress has within its power to write a criminal statute that \nwould punish someone who desecrates that flag. This amendment that I \noffer will do that expressly. It would prohibit a person from \ndestroying a flag with the intent of inciting imminent violence. It \nwould prohibit people from threatening someone by burning a flag. It \nwould prohibit damaging a flag owned by the United States. And it would \nprohibit damaging a stolen flag on Federal land.\n  Each of those elements in this amendment has been carefully thought \nout and tested against constitutional standards that have been handed \ndown by the Court.\n  You may recall, if you follow the Supreme Court decisions, that not \nlong ago there was a historic decision in Virginia v. Black. The year \nwas 2003. The Court in that decision held that the Government may \nprohibit people from burning crosses with the intent to intimidate.\n  You know what the symbol of burning a cross is. It is a symbol of \nhatred and bigotry and prejudice. It is especially a hateful symbol to \nAfrican Americans who recall our bitter past of slavery, before the \ndawn of the civil rights movement. And the Supreme Court made it clear. \nIt said, the Government may prohibit intimidation by the use of burning \ncrosses.\n  We use the same logic and the same argument of the Court and apply it \nto the flag.\n  For those who have come to the floor--and many have--and said how \nmuch they respect the flag, we offer them a reasonable alternative: an \nalternative that protects the flag without infringing our Bill of \nRights.\n  I think that is the way we should move. We have learned long ago that \nwhen it comes to amending the Constitution, it shouldn't be the first \nthing we do. It should be the last resort. That sacred document \ndeserves to be honored and only changed when absolutely necessary for \nAmerica.\n  There is a criminal statute that I am going to propose as an \nalternative way to protect that flag, to show respect for that flag, \nand to still show respect for our Bill of Rights.\n  Let me tell you about another issue which we address in this \namendment. You have read about it. If you read it, as I have recently, \nit makes you sick. What I am referring to is a group nominally calling \nthemselves Christians that is now picketing and protesting at the \nfunerals of our fallen soldiers. There is a man by the name of Phelps. \nHe calls himself a minister. But his gospel seems to begin and end with \nhatred--hatred for gays and lesbians, and obviously hatred and \ninsensitivity for the poor families of our fallen veterans.\n  About 15 years ago, this man Phelps and his so-called church \nfollowers started showing up at the funerals of men and women who died \nof HIV/AIDS. They have reportedly picketed over 22,000 funerals and \nother events across America. When their vile acts of incivility stopped \ngenerating the publicity they sought, Mr. Phelps found a new target.\n  I am reluctant to show these photos because I don't want to encourage \nthis man. But I have to tell you that it puts in context what we are \ntalking about today. Imagine if you had someone who calls themselves \nGod-fearing and goes to the funeral of fallen soldiers with signs like \nthese, ``Thank God for 9/11'' and ``You are going to hell.''\n  Here is another one of those followers holding a sign at a veteran's \nfuneral, ``God hates you.'' Here he is. ``AIDS is God's curse.''\n  I received a letter recently from the wife of one of our fallen \nheroes in Iraq. Mr. Phelps and his group showed up at her husband's \nfuneral.\n  Can you imagine the heartbreak that family must have felt, losing a \nfather, a husband, a brother, coming for that sad moment of parting and \nthen to have these protesters standing around saying that God hates \nyou.\n  In the past year, these hate-mongers have protested at more than 100 \nmilitary funerals in America. They claim that the deaths of America's \nArmed Forces are God's punishment for America's tolerance for those \nwith different sexual orientation. This is such an affront to the \nfamilies, to everyone in uniform, and to our Nation.\n  I think there will be a special place in the next life for these \npeople, but there is no place for their brand of hatred at veterans' \nfunerals in this life.\n  Last month, we passed a bill which the President signed into law that \nmade it clear that Mr. Phelps and his faithful followers could not \nengage in this sort of demonstration at our 121 national cemeteries.\n  The amendment which I will be offering includes a section which not \nonly protects our flag by making it a crime to defile or desecrate \nunder the circumstances I mentioned, it goes further. It expands the \nbill that we passed earlier. It applies the same standards as would \napply to national cemeteries to the funerals of all veterans, whether \nthey are buried in a national cemetery or in their own church cemetery \nor somewhere else.\n  My amendment will prohibit protests at cemeteries, funeral homes, \nhouses of worship and other locations where deceased veterans are \nhonored and buried.\n  We can honor our veterans and protect our loved ones from these \nhateful, barbaric intrusions on the grief of their families. We can do \nthis without weakening or assaulting our Constitution. We can do this \nwithout diminishing the basic freedoms we revere in our Nation--\nfreedoms that those veterans fought for.\n  I ask my colleagues to stop, pause, and think for a moment. If we can \nachieve this, if we can truly protect this flag and if we can protect \nthe veterans and their families from these hateful demonstrations \nwithout amendment to our Constitution, let's do that. Let's join \ntogether on a bipartisan basis.\n  We often disagree in this Chamber. Debates go on and on. Can't we \ncome together in agreement on this that we love this flag and can \nprotect it without amending our Constitution, that we respect our \nveterans, soldiers and their families, and that now we include this \nprovision as well to protect them?\n  The amendment I offer is very narrow. It doesn't ban all protest \nactivities. It permits protests outside military funerals as long as \nprotesters don't engage in loud activities. But it draws strict \nguidelines so that you can't disrupt that funeral home by putting \ndemonstrators and pickets within certain distances consistent with our \nconstitutional rights.\n  I hope that those who will consider this amendment will go back to \nthe point I made earlier. We can stand for this flag and we can stand \nfor our veterans. But first we must stand for our Constitution. We \nshould address this Constitution with humility and with the \nunderstanding that the words that have inspired our Nation and people \naround the world for more than 200 years are words worth protecting. \nAnd that before we come to this floor for whatever motive to change \nthose words, if we can find an alternative to create Federal crimes for \nthe activities that we find so objectionable, so abhorrent, it is a \nmuch more reasonable path to follow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Illinois for the \namendment he has offered. It is my understanding that it is the same \nwording of the amendment to the bill which I offered and which is \npending before the Judiciary Committee, cosponsored with Senator \nClinton and others but that he has added a section to it which I find \nvery worthwhile. I thank him for his thoughtfulness and for the section \nthat he has added with respect to funerals and cemeteries, and for his \ndiligence in bringing forward that piece of legislation which I had \noffered and which has been bogged down in the Judiciary Committee for \nwhatever reason. I am grateful to him for his consideration.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor to his \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, while I have the floor, I would like to \nmake\n\n[[Page S6522]]\n\nthis comment about the debate that is before us.\n  I have great personal conflicts on this issue because my senior \ncolleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, is the cosponsor and the principal \nsponsor of the constitutional amendment which would empower the \nCongress to have the right to take legislative action to protect the \nflag.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is currently under the control of the \nminority.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that whatever time \nhe uses be charged to the majority and I reserve our time \nappropriately.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank my friend from Massachusetts. I wasn't aware of \nthe time situation.\n  I have enormous respect for Senator Hatch--not only for his legal \nability but perhaps more so for his sincerity and his commitment to \nthis cause.\n  This is not something he is doing for any cheap political purpose. \nThis is not something he is doing to grandstand. This is something that \nhe is doing because he sincerely believes it. He is sincerely committed \nto the idea that protecting the flag is an essential thing for us to \ndo, not only to honor our veterans but to teach our children the \nimportance of the flag in the future.\n  I respect that, and I am with him. But I cannot quite bring myself to \namend the Constitution in the manner that he suggests for those \npurposes. I want to make it very clear that I do not under any \ncircumstances denigrate those purposes. I believe that the legislation \nI offered--which, as I indicated, is still before the Judiciary \nCommittee--would take care of the challenges of protecting our flag. He \ndisagrees. He insists that my legislation would be unconstitutional \nbased on past precedent.\n  Checking with legal authorities, I am assured that it is \nconstitutional. That is not the point. The Senate will work its will \none way or the other with respect to this.\n  I simply want to make it clear that although I have come to the \nconclusion that a constitutional amendment under the present \ncircumstances is not necessary, this does not mean that I surrender one \nwhit of my respect for and loyalty to my senior colleague. The Senate \nwill make its decision. I will be happy with whatever that decision \nmight be.\n  I once again extend my support and respect for my senior colleague \neven as I announce my intention to vote in a different path.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes remain on the minority side.\n  Mr. KERRY. Only 5 minutes of the total?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KERRY. Is that on the half hour?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, would it be possible, because we got pushed \nback a little bit, that I could have 10 or 15 minutes on my time and \nthen slide it back the other way?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to proceed \nfor 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, let me begin by saying that all through the years we \nhave been here before. We have had this vote before a number of times. \nAnd each time, thank God, the Senate in its wisdom has protected the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  I must say that I have concern at a time when real leaders ought to \nbe uniting the country around our biggest challenges, in a summer when \nAmerican soldiers are in harm's way in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere \nin the world, while families at home are struggling with record gas \nprices, with health care costs soaring, jobs being shipped overseas and \nveterans who are defending our country and flag are still going without \nthe health care they were promised, it is astonishing that we are here \nhaving this debate.\n  This debate, like wars themselves, can pit father against father, \nfamily against family, veteran against veteran. It is a complicated \ndebate emotionally, and I understand that. I am not doubting at all the \nemotional feeling which is real for every American about our flag. We \nall understand that.\n  I remember taking an oath in 1965 with a group of friends of mine who \ndecided--all of us--that we ought to serve our country. We went into \ndifferent branches of the service with a common sense of what our \nobligation was. But when I raised my hand, I did not raise my hand to \ndefend the flag; I raised my hand and took an oath to defend the \nConstitution and our country.\n  A lot of those friends did not come home. They were buried in coffins \nthat bore that flag until the moment of their burial, and then that \nflag was given to a family member. That flag was a symbol of their \nsacrifice, a symbol of their gift, a symbol of our country itself and \nall that it stands for, but it was not our country itself. I think each \nof us still feels bound by those oaths.\n  I took almost the same oath when I came here to the Senate. The \nobligation is the same: to defend what the Framers of the Constitution \nintended and never to give in to the passions of the moment, to the \nmomentary urge to try to respond to something emotional that, no matter \nhow much the emotion is genuine, and it is, takes away from the larger \nprinciple and larger set of values that guide our country.\n  I think it would be a grave mistake if we broke those oaths in the \nSenate today. We need to listen to the voices of patriotism which urge \nus to do our real duty. Our former colleague, one of the best and \nbravest men I know, Senator John Glenn, said:\n\n       [T]hose 10 amendments we call the Bill of Rights have never \n     been changed or altered by one iota, not by one word, not a \n     single time in all of American history. There was not a \n     single change during any of our foreign wars, and not during \n     recessions or depressions or panics. Not a single change when \n     we were going through times of great emotion and anger like \n     the Vietnam era, when flag after flag was burned or \n     desecrated. There is only one way to weaken our nation.\n\n  Senator Glenn said:\n\n       The way to weaken our nation would be to erode the freedom \n     that we all share.\n\n  Gary May, who lost both his legs above the knee after a landmine \nexplosion in Vietnam--a veteran who was awarded the Bronze Star with \ncombat ``V'' and the Purple Heart--spoke for all of us when he said:\n\n       [A]s offensive and painful as flag burning is to me, I \n     still believe that those dissenting voices need to be heard. \n     . . . The freedom of expression, even when it hurts, is the \n     truest test of our dedication to the belief that we have that \n     right.\n\n  This is not a test of who loves the flag; this is a test of who has \nthe courage to protect the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, as I said, I think every single American feels the \nsame emotions when they see the flag. I have seen it in so many \ndifferent kinds of circumstances where I have been moved and touched by \nwhat it does symbolize to us. But our flag is, in the end, not the Bill \nof Rights. It does not carry in it the freedoms that are expressed in \nthe Bill of Rights. It symbolizes those freedoms. The fact is, who we \nare is embodied, above all, in a document that has not been changed \nsince the beginning. A desecrated flag is replaceable. Desecrated \nrights are lost forever.\n  What makes the United States different, I think in many ways stronger \nthan any other nation, is our ability to be able to tolerate opinions \nwe do not agree with, to tolerate diversity, to tolerate the aspiration \nfor a people to be able to express themselves even when we disagree. \nThat is what is different about the United States. Thanks to our \nConstitution, we are the leading proponent on the face of the planet \nfor the greatest experiment in freedom set forth in words and in \npractice.\n  At the end of our national anthem we sing, with hand over chest, to \nthe flag: ``land of the free and home of the brave.'' If this amendment \npasses, make no mistake about it, we will be a little less free and we \nwill be a little less brave.\n  Ivan Warner, an American soldier who was imprisoned by the North \nVietnamese from 1967 to 1973, wrote:\n\n       I remember one interrogation where I was shown a photograph \n     of some Americans protesting the war by burning a flag. \n     ``There,'' the officer said. ``People in your country protest \n     against your cause. That proves you are wrong.''\n\n  And this prisoner of war, not knowing if he would ever be returned to \nAmerica or whether he would be tortured for what he said, said:\n\n       ``No. That proves that I am right. In my country we are not \n     afraid of freedom, even if\n\n[[Page S6523]]\n\n     it means that people disagree with us.'' The officer [who was \n     interrogating him] was on his feet in an instant, his face \n     purple with rage. He smashed his fist into the table and \n     screamed at [Ivan] to shut up.\n\n  And Ivan said:\n\n       While he was ranting I was astonished to see pain, \n     compounded by fear, in his eyes. I have never forgotten that \n     look, nor have I forgotten the satisfaction I felt at using \n     his tool, the picture of the burning flag, against him.\n\n  In the words of Ivan Warner:\n\n       We don't need to amend the Constitution in order to punish \n     those who burn our flag. They burn the flag because they hate \n     America and they are afraid of freedom. What better way to \n     hurt them than with the subversive idea of freedom? Spread \n     freedom. . . . Don't be afraid of freedom.\n\n  In the final analysis, there are eight other powerful reasons for why \nwe should not do this. They are Iran, Libya, North Korea, China, Cuba, \nSyria, and the Sudan. And of the many nations--there are about 30-plus \nof them--that have laws about not burning the flag--even a few of our \nfriends--none of them have a constitution that prohibits it. I do not \nthink the United States of America ought to join those countries, \nincluding Iraq under Saddam Hussein, the South Africa of apartheid, and \nNazi Germany.\n  So I ask my fellow Senators, are we really that frightened of \nsomebody's willingness to go out and be stupid? In the United States of \nAmerica, you have a right to be stupid. You have a right to go out and \ndo something that every one of us thinks is dishonorable or \nunacceptable. And communities can punish those people in any number of \nways. I have voted previously for a statute in the U.S. Senate because \nI believe a statute is enforceable and does less violence to the \nConstitution. And there are plenty of ways for prosecutors--on \ndisturbance of the peace or destruction of personal property or any \nother numbers of ways--to prosecute people. But, in the end, a \ncommunity of Americans, whose love of flag is so great, is going to \nostracize anybody who engages in that kind of behavior. Communities \nhave the ability to make sure they do not get jobs, to make sure they \nare persona non grata within the community.\n  It is unbelievable to me, with only two flags we know of being burned \nin this last year--something like eight or so in the last 365 days in \nAmerica--that this prompts Senators to feel they have to change the \nConstitution for the first time and the first amendment for the first \ntime. I think it is wrong. I think our country is bigger than that, and \nI hope our colleagues in this institution will be today.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, ever since I began my campaign for the \nU.S. Senate over 6 years ago, I have consistently promised to support \nthe proposed constitutional amendment to prohibit the desecration of \nthe American Flag. Indeed, I am a cosponsor of that constitutional \namendment, which will soon be voted upon by the Senate.\n  I value and respect the first amendment's protection of free speech, \nand I have personally experienced its importance. When I opposed the \nVietnam War in the 1960s and '70s, the first amendment permitted my \nlawful dissent, although it did not prevent President Richard Nixon's \nJustice Department from tear-gassing our demonstrations or from \nunlawfully spying upon me. A generation and another war later, the \nfirst amendment again protected my right to speak out against President \nBush's policies without intimidation or incarceration, and, this time, \nwithout being tear-gassed. I would never infringe upon those precious \nfreedoms of expression and dissent.\n  The question before us today is not whether we honor the first \namendment, which we do, but, rather, whether an act as vile as burning \nthe American flag should be considered ``free speech'' or is it an act \nof such wanton violence and outrageous disrespect that it should be \n``out of bounds''? I come to the second conclusion.\n  Our Nation's Pledge of Allegiance was first published almost 114 \nyears ago and was established by Congress in 1923. It states, ``I \npledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to \nthe Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, \nwith liberty and justice for all.''\n  I note, parenthetically, that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1943 \nthat under the first amendment no one can be compelled to recite the \nPledge of Allegiance. Nevertheless, it is one of our most revered \nstatements of citizenship. It does not pledge allegiance to a \nDemocratic or a Republican administration. It does not pledge \nallegiance to any ideology, policy, or platform.\n  It pledges allegiance to the flag of the United States of America--\nand to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, \nindivisible, with liberty and justice for all. In other words, \nallegiance to something above any one of us. To something that unites \nus as one people indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n  Those are our Nation's founding principles. They are our eternal \nideals. We can disagree; we can dissent; we can lawfully protest; we \ncan say almost anything we want and do most of what we want, because \nthose are our rights. They are precious, inviolable rights.\n  But we also have responsibilities. This great country cannot succeed, \nif we concern ourselves with nothing more than our rights as \nindividuals. We must equally consider our responsibilities as citizens.\n  This Constitutional amendment says that one of those responsibilities \nof citizenship is to not burn or otherwise desecrate our American flag. \nI am astounded that the U.S. Supreme Court could construe that as free \nspeech, but it has. This amendment would simply permit Congress to \ndeclare otherwise and to place that senseless act of desecration \noutside the boundary of freedom of speech, just as the Supreme Court \nrecently ruled burning a cross outside that boundary of protected free \nspeech.\n  I am willing to take this carefully considered action, because of \nwhat I know the American flag means to millions of American citizens. \nMany of them are relatives or friends of heroic Americans who have \ngiven their lives to defend our country. In my view, those great \nAmerican heroes have consecrated our flag with their precious blood. \nHonoring our flag honors their extraordinary sacrifices, as it honors \nthe principles and ideals for which they died.\n  That is why I will vote for this constitutional amendment.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition to the \nproposed constitutional amendment.\n  There have been so many moments in our history where the flag was not \njust a piece of cloth. It was a focal point that united this country \nthrough both our most difficult days and our proudest moments. This is \nthe flag that inspired Francis Scott Key in Baltimore Harbor during the \nWar of 1812. It is the flag that Illinois soldiers rallied to during \nthe Battle of Gettysburg. It is the flag that marines raised over Mount \nSuribachi on Iwo Jima during a battle that claimed 6,800 American \nlives. It is the flag that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin planted on \nthe surface of the moon. It is the flag that was draped over the \ncharred Pentagon following the September 11 attack. It is the flag that \nrests atop the caskets of the men and women who give the ultimate \nsacrifice in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I cannot imagine anything more abhorrent to a veteran than seeing the \nflag they fought for, or watched their good friends die for, being \nburned to make a political point. Although I have not served in the \nmilitary, I too have great pride in our flag, as do the overwhelming \nmajority of Americans. I share outrage at the thought of its being \ndisrespected. I have never seen anyone burn a flag. And if I did, it \nwould take every ounce of restraint I had not to haul off and hit them.\n  But we live in a country of laws. Laws that stop people from \nresorting to physical violence to settle disagreements. Laws that \nprotect free speech. The primacy of the law is one of the things that \nprotects us, one of the things that makes us great.\n  When I took this job last year I was asked to swear an oath of \noffice. It is a short, simple oath, and everyone in this Chamber has \nrepeated it. It begins: ``I do solemnly swear that I will support and \ndefend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, \nforeign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the \nsame.'' Our first allegiance here is not to a political party, or to an \nideology, or to a President, or even popular opinion, it is to the \nConstitution and to the rule of law.\n\n[[Page S6524]]\n\n  Senator Byrd often talks about the Constitution as a remarkable \ndocument that transformed a revolutionary movement to a stable \ngovernment that has lasted more than 200 years and is the envy of the \nworld. He is right.\n  The Constitution has only been amended 27 times. The amendments \ninclude guarantees of our most basic freedoms, the freedom of religion, \nthe right to a trial by jury, the protection against cruel punishment. \nThe amendments also chronicle the great struggles of this country. The \n13th amendment abolished slavery in 1865. The 17th provided for the \ndirect election of senators in 1913. The 19th amendment gave women the \nright to vote in 1920. The 24th eliminated the poll tax in 1964.\n  The Framers established a high bar for amending the Constitution, and \nfor good reason. It is difficult to amend the Constitution because our \nfounding document should not be changed just because of political \nconcerns or temporary problems. The Constitution should only be amended \nto address our Nation's most pressing problems that can't be solved \nwith legislation. But even the supporters of this amendment are hard \npressed to find more than a few instances of flag burning each year.\n  Today, there are hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops risking their \nlives for their country, looking to us to come up with a plan to win \nthe peace so they can come home. Across America, there are millions who \nare looking for us to do something about health care, about education, \nabout energy. We are only supposed to be in session for about 50 more \ndays for the rest of this year. To spend the precious time we have left \nbattling an epidemic of flag burning that does not exist is a \ndisservice to our country.\n  Mr. President, 141 years ago, Congress passed--and the States \napproved--the 13th amendment to end slavery. A century and a half \nlater, Americans can look back at that effort and be proud. What will \nAmericans 141 years from now think if we pass the 28th amendment to ban \nflag burning? Will they breathe a sigh of relief that we made the world \nsafe from flag burners? Or will they see this for what it is: an effort \nto distract, an effort to score political points, an effort to use the \nsame flag that should unite us to instead divide us? I believe they \nwill laugh and shake their heads.\n  During this debate, we have heard much about Colin Powell's \nopposition to this amendment. I am moved by his statement that:\n\n       I would not amend that great shield of democracy to hammer \n     a few miscreants. The flag will still be flying proudly long \n     after they have slunk away.\n\n  His view is shared by the many calls and letters I have received from \nIllinois veterans. All of them full of honest passion, and all of them \nsharing a common love of flag and country. I want to read a bit from a \nfew of the letters I received.\n  Richard Savage of Bloomington wrote me:\n\n       I am a Vietnam veteran and Republican. . . . Those who \n     would burn the flag destroy the symbol of freedom, but \n     amending the Constitution would destroy part of freedom \n     itself.\n\n  Marci Daniels from Edwardsville wrote:\n\n       I am a veteran and I oppose the flag amendment. I did not \n     put my life on the line for the flag, but for the \n     Constitution and the freedoms it guarantees.\n\n  Terrence Hutton of Winnetka wrote:\n\n       As a Vietnam war veteran, I did not like the steady fare of \n     flag-burnings we seemed to see on TV and in the print media \n     back in those unhappy days, but I accepted them as part of \n     the price we pay as a free society. . . . We have survived \n     this long without a flag-burning provision in the \n     Constitution and can go right on surviving without one.\n\n  These are all proud Americans, veterans. They know that we should not \nplay politics with the Constitution. We shouldn't distract voters in an \nelection year, when there are so many common challenges we face and so \nlittle time to face them.\n  There is, in fact, another way. There is a way to balance our respect \nfor the flag with reverence for the Constitution. Senators Clinton and \nBennett are proposing an amendment to this proposal that would protect \nthe flag without amending the Constitution. Their statutory approach is \na new one that doesn't fall into the same constitutional traps that \ndoomed previous flag protection bills. The Clinton-Bennett amendment is \nnarrowly drawn to meet the first amendment tests the Supreme Court has \nlaid out in previous court decisions. It makes it illegal to burn a \nflag in a threatening way or to incite violence. I believe this statute \nwill pass constitutional muster and be upheld by the Supreme Court.\n  I will vote for the Clinton-Bennett amendment in an effort to find a \nway to balance our respect for the flag and our protection of the \nConstitution. I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I intend to vote in favor of \nthis resolution.\n  The flag is a sacred symbol to this country and its citizens. Men and \nwomen have given their lives to protect the ideals embodied in the \nflag, and it's a unifying representation of America and all that we \nvalue. I believe it is a symbol worthy of protection.\n  This resolution will give Congress the ability to consider \nlegislation that will protect the flag and prevent its desecration.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I will support the Durbin amendment \nto pass a statute to protect the flag and address the very real problem \nof protests at military funerals.\n  I was recently at a funeral for a North Dakota soldier, and I was \ndisgusted--absolutely disgusted--by the behavior of protesters who used \nthe funeral to convey their twisted message of hatred for our soldiers \nand their families. The Durbin amendment would restrict these protests \nfrom the immediate area of the funeral, and it would protect the flag \nwithout amending the Constitution of the United States for that \npurpose.\n  Anybody who advances an amendment to the Constitution has to clear a \nvery high threshold. The Constitution of the United States is one of \nthe greatest documents in human history. It is not to be amended \nlightly. And it should certainly not be amended when there are other \nways of addressing a problem.\n  In our history, more than 10,000 amendments to the Constitution have \nbeen proposed. Only 27 have been approved. Since I have been in the \nSenate, more than 850 constitutional amendments have been offered.\n  Thank goodness we have not adopted them. Many of them would have made \nthat document worse. Many of them would have done things that ought to \nbe done by statute.\n  The Constitution is a framework. It does not deal with specifics. It \ndeals with the larger framework of how this Government should operate. \nIndividual laws, individual statutes are meant to deal with the \nspecific problems that we encounter as a society within the framework \nprovided by the Constitution. Some would have us change that basic \norganic document to deal with this problem. I believe that would be a \nmistake that we would come to regret.\n  Flag burning and flag desecration are unacceptable to me and \nunacceptable to a majority of Americans. They are certainly \nunacceptable to the people of the State that I represent. But the first \nanswer cannot and should not be to amend the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  Of course, it is unacceptable to engage in flag desecration. Of \ncourse, it is abhorrent to desecrate the flag. We do not need to amend \nthe Constitution to address these few instances of deplorable conduct. \nWe have an alternative. The alternative is to pass a statute.\n  The proponents of the constitutional amendment will say that the \nstatutory alternative will be ruled unconstitutional, as has the \nprevious attempt to pass a statute.\n  But this statute has not been ruled unconstitutional, and a range of \nconstitutional experts believe it would pass constitutional muster. \nThey are saying to us this statute would be upheld. It is my view that \nwe ought to see if they are right before we conclude that the only \nalternative is to amend our Constitution. We ought to give the Supreme \nCourt a chance to look at this statute, and see if we can find a way to \nprotect the flag by statute before we amend the Constitution.\n  I am not alone in taking this position. I have heard from \ndistinguished veterans all across my state and all across the country \nwho agree that the Constitution does not need to be amended to protect \nthe flag.\n  For example, Rick Olek, a 22-year member of the American Legion, a\n\n[[Page S6525]]\n\ncombat veteran, and a Purple Heart recipient, has written:\n\n       As a combat veteran, I fought for this country and I \n     respect our flag, but I also respect the rights of freedom of \n     speech. The position of Senators Conrad and Dorgan on the \n     flag amendment is consistent with protecting first amendment \n     rights as well as protecting our flag.\n\n  Similarly, Mike Dobmeier, former National Commander of the Disabled \nAmerican Veterans, says:\n\n       I fought--and many of my comrades died--to protect the \n     freedom and ideals the U.S flag embodies. Senator Conrad \n     understands our sacrifice and he is working tirelessly to \n     protect Old Glory. Last year he introduced bipartisan \n     legislation that would criminalize the desecration of our \n     flag, rather than changing the Constitution. Senator Conrad \n     knows that we can protect our flag without infringing on the \n     precious freedom it represents.\n\n  And Brad Maasjo, a retired Air Force Colonel from Fargo, ND, writes:\n\n       There is a poem that says in part that `. . . it is the \n     soldier, who fights for the flag . . . whose coffin is draped \n     by the flag . . . who wins the right to protest the flag. . . \n     .'' Maybe if we take away that right, we also lose sight of \n     what he fought for in the first place.\n\n  These are just a few of the people I have heard from, proud North \nDakota veterans who support the flag but also revere our Constitution. \nThey tell me that they abhor flag desecration, but that the flag is a \nsymbol for the liberties and freedoms they fought to protect. They do \nnot want to rush to amend the Constitution when there are other options \navailable.\n  Finally, GEN Colin Powell, Secretary of State Powell, has written the \nCongress to say he does not believe that the appropriate response is to \namend the Constitution of the United States. GEN Colin Powell, former \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the man who led us in Desert \nStorm, a man for whom I have profound respect says:\n\n       I understand how strongly so many of my fellow veterans and \n     citizens feel about the flag and I understand the powerful \n     sentiment in state legislatures for such an amendment. I feel \n     the same sense of outrage. But I step back from amending the \n     Constitution to relieve that outrage. . . . I would not amend \n     that great shield of democracy to hammer a few miscreants. \n     The flag will be flying proudly long after they have slunk \n     away.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to step back from the constitutional amendment \nand instead support the Durbin amendment. This is the wiser course. It \nis the right course. It is one that will stand the test of time.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to S.J. Res. 12, \nthe flag desecration constitutional amendment.\n  I believe our flag is a living symbol that represents this great \ncountry and its rich history. As a World War II veteran, I feel a deep \nconnection to our flag, and it offends me when I see the flag burned or \ntreated poorly. Our flag deserves our reverence and respect.\n  As a U.S. Senator, I have sworn to protect the Constitution and the \nfreedoms for which it stands. I believe it would be wrong to amend the \nConstitution to infringe upon our first amendment freedoms. Although I \nfind it personally detestable that someone would desecrate the flag, it \nis my duty to protect the right to free speech and expression. To me, \nthis amendment would protect our Nation's preeminent symbol at the cost \nof sacrificing the very freedoms that it is supposed to represent.\n  This amendment is all the more troublesome because it is wholly \nunnecessary. Americans are not lacking in patriotism nor is there an \nepidemic of flag burning. To the contrary, in these five years since \nthe tragic events of September 11, 2001, Americans have vigorously \nrallied around our flag and the liberties it represents.\n  For these reasons, Mr. President, I will be opposing S.J. Res. 12, \nand I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the American flag is a cherished symbol of \nour freedom and the democratic values and liberties that we believe in, \nand we should respect the flag as a reminder of the bravery of the men \nand women who have lost their lives fighting under its colors for our \ncountry. One of the most poignant images to a patriotic American is \nwhen that flag is draped over the coffin of a fallen soldier.\n  I detest flag burning. To deliberately desecrate the flag is an \ninsult to anyone who has fought to defend it and to all of us who love \nit. Any person who destroys such an important reminder of sacrifice and \npatriotism deserves the scorn of all decent men and women.\n  Although I love the flag, I also love the Constitution and its Bill \nof Rights. For more than 210 years, this timeless document has \nprotected our most basic freedoms. The Supreme Court has ruled that a \nphysical attack on the flag is a protected form of speech under the \nfirst amendment.\n  In 1984, Gregory Johnson publicly burned an American flag as a means \nof political protest and was convicted of desecrating a flag in \nviolation of Texas law. In Texas v. Johnson, the Supreme Court held \nthat, although ``the government has a legitimate interest in making \nefforts to `preserv[e] the national flag as an unalloyed symbol of our \ncountry,' '' Johnson's burning of the flag was constitutionally \nprotected speech.\n  In response to that decision, Congress passed the Flag Protection \nAct, a Federal law to prohibit flag-burning and other forms of \ndesecration. I supported that legislation, but the Supreme Court found \nit unconstitutional in United States v. Eichman. The Court found that \nthe statute suppressed constitutionally protected expression, and held:\n\n       The Government's interest in protecting the ``physical \n     integrity'' of a privately owned flag rests upon a perceived \n     need to preserve the flag's status as a symbol of our Nation \n     and certain national ideals. But the mere destruction or \n     disfigurement of a particular physical manifestation of the \n     symbol, without more, does not diminish or otherwise affect \n     the symbol itself in any way. . . . While flag desecration--\n     like virulent ethnic and religious epithets, vulgar \n     repudiations of the draft, and scurrilous caricatures--is \n     deeply offensive to many, the Government may not prohibit the \n     expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea \n     itself offensive or disagreeable.\n\n  Now that the Court has decided that flag burning as a means of \nexpression is constitutionally protected, the question for the Senate \nis whether to amend the Constitution to ban such speech. Our \nConstitution has been amended only 17 times since the adoption of the \nBill of Rights in 1789. The Bill of Rights has never been amended. I \nbelieve that to deliberately weaken the first amendment rights of all \nAmericans is not the answer to those very few who attack a symbol of \nfreedom.\n  Senator John Glenn, an American hero who fought for our country \nthrough two wars and took our flag into space, eloquently expressed \nthis view before the Judiciary Committee:\n\n       [I]t would be a hollow victory indeed if we preserved the \n     symbol of our freedoms by chipping away at those fundamental \n     freedoms themselves. Let the flag fully represent all the \n     freedoms spelled out in the Bill of Rights, not a partial, \n     watered-down version that alters its protections.\n       The flag is the nation's most powerful and emotional \n     symbol. It is our most sacred symbol. And it is our most \n     revered symbol. But it is a symbol. It symbolizes the \n     freedoms we have in this country, but it is not the freedoms \n     themselves.\n\n  Steve Sanderson, a Michigan Vietnam-era veteran, expressed a similar \nview as quoted in the Detroit Free Press on June 14, 2006. He said:\n\n       Veterans certainly cherish the flag, perhaps more than \n     civilians who have never been to war can realize. But \n     commitment is not confined to that symbol. I am hurt when I \n     see the flag burned, largely because I've also seen the flag \n     draped on coffins of troops. But my patriotism lives in my \n     heart and mind. We set a very dangerous precedent if we argue \n     that certain forms of speech should be restricted because the \n     majority disagrees with the message and how it is expressed.\n\n  Mr. President, I love our flag. I love our Constitution. Flag \ndesecration is repugnant, but it would be a mistake to let a flag \nburner cause us to weaken our first amendment guarantees. If we take \nthis fateful step of singling out one symbol to exempt from the first \namendment, will we next authorize Congress to make it a crime to rip up \na copy of the Constitution or a copy of its Bill of Rights?\n  The American flag symbolizes our freedom, and that includes freedom \nfrom an overreaching government that decides which symbols are worthy \nof protection. We are honoring our flag and the republic for which it \nstands by refusing to amend the Bill of Rights in response to a few \nmisguided people.\n  I do support the statute that will be offered as a substitute for the \nconstitutional amendment, which provides that: ``Any person who shall \nintentionally threaten or intimidate any\n\n[[Page S6526]]\n\nperson or group of persons by burning, or causing to be burned, a flag \nof the United States shall be fined not more than $100,000, imprisoned \nfor not more than 1 year or both.'' The Supreme Court has held that the \nfirst amendment does not provide full protection for what are called \n``fighting words.'' or those words which, by their very utterance, \ninflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.\n  Also, in Virginia v. Black, a case that involved the burning of a \ncross, the Supreme Court held that the government can prohibit people \nfrom burning crosses with the intent to intimidate. In that case, \nVirginia law prohibited cross burning through a statute that made it \nunlawful for any person to burn a cross with the intent of intimidating \nany person or group of persons. A majority of the Court held that it \nbelieved the substantive prohibition on cross-burning with an intent to \nintimate was constitutionally permissible. Writing for the majority, \nJustice O'Connor said:\n\n       The protections afforded by the First Amendment, however, \n     are not absolute, and we have long recognized that the \n     government may regulate certain categories of expression \n     consistent with the Constitution . . . Thus, for example, a \n     State may punish those words ``which by their very utterance \n     inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the \n     peace. . . . We have consequently held that fighting words \n     ``those personally abusive epithets which, when addressed to \n     the ordinary citizen, are, as a matter of common knowledge, \n     inherently likely to provide violent reaction'' are generally \n     proscribable under the First Amendment.''\n\n  The substitute also contains an important provision to support our \nmilitary families in their time of grief. During the past year, a \nfringe religious group has held protests at more than 100 military \nfunerals across the Nation, claiming that the deaths of U.S. soldiers \nis God's punishment of America. In May, Congress passed and the \nPresident signed into law the Respect for America's Fallen Heroes Act, \nwhich prohibits demonstrations at and around national cemeteries. This \namendment would expand that Act to include military funerals at private \ncemeteries, funeral homes, and houses of worship. The families of the \nfallen have a right to be free to bury their loved ones and our heroes \nin peace.\n  I support this narrowly drawn substitute because it both protects the \nflag, consistent with the Bill of Rights, as well as honors those who \nhave made the ultimate sacrifice while fighting under its colors.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to support the substitute offered \nby Senator Durbin to ban the desecration of our flag. The Durbin \nalternative stands for the same things I do. It protects the principles \nembodied in our Constitution--as well as our U.S. flag. It does not \namend the Constitution, but it will get the job done by punishing those \npeople who help wage war against the symbol of this country and \neverything it stands for.\n  I know that we have gone down this road before, by passing statutory \nlanguage to ban flag-burning only to have the Supreme Court overturn \nit. But this language has been specifically crafted so that it will \npass constitutional challenge.\n  It says you cannot get away with abusing the flag of the United \nStates or using it to incite violence. This is an exception the Supreme \nCourt has allowed. The Durbin substitute says you can't use this \nNation's symbol of freedom and turn it into a symbol of disrespect.\n  If there is a way to deal with and punish those who desecrate our \nU.S. flag without amending the Constitution, I am all for it. That is \nwhy I support the Durbin Substitute.\n  I feel very strongly about this issue. I have voted for legislation \nto prohibit flag burning, and I have voted against amending the U.S. \nConstitution. Today, I will do so again.\n  I take amending the U.S. Constitution very seriously. In the entire \nhistory of the United States we have only amended the Constitution 17 \ntimes after the Bill of Rights. Seventeen times in over 200 years--\nthat's it.\n  We have amended the Constitution to extend rights. We have amended \nthe Constitution to end slavery, give women the right to vote, and \nguarantee equal protection of the laws to all citizens. The \nConstitution protects our liberty and it is the symbol of the strength \nof our Nation. I believe that it is my obligation as a Member of this \nbody to protect its integrity and strength.\n  So many of our veterans have fought to protect our flag and what it \nstands for in battle. They have defended our flag and the nation \nagainst foreign enemies. These men and women fought valiantly to \nprotect America and this issue is very important to veterans, who fall \non both sides of the debate.\n  Many want an amendment to protect this important symbol of our \nNation. Others know that the flag is a symbol of our freedom but our \nfreedom endures beyond the cloth of the flag.\n  I respect how strongly they feel about our flag and all that it \nstands for. I share their concerns and have seriously considered \nsupporting a constitutional amendment.\n  But, I have weighed the concern about protecting this national symbol \nwith the need to defend our Constitution and the rights of free speech. \nI believe that the substitute offered by Senator Durbin strikes the \nright balance. My colleague from Illinois has offered an alternative to \namending the Constitution that would protect the flag and protect the \nConstitution. I will support that alternative approach today.\n  Yet, I can't help but be concerned about why we are raising this \nissue now. There has not been a sudden surge in flag burning. In fact, \nto the contrary, I see more Americans waving their flags proudly as \nthey support our troops overseas. It disappoints me that we raise this \nissue now, instead of focusing on priorities that really matter to \nveterans.\n  Instead of focusing on amending the Constitution, we should be \nstanding up for our veterans where it really counts. Support for our \nmilitary in the field must be matched by support for our veterans at \nhome. This means deeds, not just words.\n  There are 25 million veterans in the United States. These veterans \nserved with honor, bravery and sacrifice. The way to thank them is with \na commitment to veteran's healthcare, veteran's programs and veteran's \nservices.\n  Whether at Iwo Jima, Pork Chop Hill, the Mekong Delta, Falluja or the \nmountains of Afghanistan, our veterans shouldn't have to fight for the \nservices they need and deserve at home. Instead of debating this \namendment, the Senate should take up and pass Senator Akaka's Keeping \nOur Promise to America's Veterans Act.\n  I am proud to cosponsor this bill, which does five things to provide \nreal support to our veterans with deeds, not just with words. First, it \nmakes sure veterans get full funding for veterans medical care by \naccounting for growing vets population and rising health care costs. \nSecond, it provides mental health care to vets from Afghanistan and \nIraq. Third, it allows VA hospitals to fill prescriptions written by \nprivate doctors. Fourth, the bill guarantees concurrent receipt of \nmilitary retired pay and VA disability benefits. Finally, this bill \nmakes it easier to take advantage of the G.I. bill by excluding G.I. \nbenefits from financial aid eligibility computations.\n  I am disappointed that the Senate has chosen to spend time on this \ndebate, instead of taking up this important bill and keeping our \npromise to America's veterans. We are giving our veterans rhetoric \ninstead of results, and I am deeply disappointed for Maryland's 500,000 \nveterans, and veterans all across the Nation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to speak in \nopposition to the flag desecration amendment to the Constitution.\n  If I were strictly following my emotions, I would no doubt favor this \namendment. After all, I can imagine few acts more despicable, \noffensive, and cowardly than to deliberately desecrate the flag of the \nUnited States of America. But in considering this constitutional \namendment, which for the first time would amend the Bill of Rights, we \nhave a solemn responsibility to separate reason from passion. We have a \nresponsibility to preserve and protect the Stars and Stripes of the \nUnited States of America. But even more importantly, we have a \nresponsibility to preserve and protect the principles and rights for \nwhich it stands.\n  Fortunately, instances of flag desecration in the United States are \nextremely rare. Nonetheless, there is no denying the emotions and anger \nthat\n\n[[Page S6527]]\n\nare incited even by the thought of someone desecrating the American \nflag. I myself feel those emotions and that anger. I believe that we \nall do. We all have memories that cut deep to the heart, and when we \nsee the flag on fire it feels like something burning inside of us.\n  I remember what the flag meant to my mother, an immigrant from what \nis now Slovenia, who came to America speaking just a few words in \nEnglish. When I was growing up, the American flag was always proudly \ndisplayed in our home because, to my mother, that flag meant the \nfreedom of her new country.\n  I have not forgotten my mother's pride, and even now the American \nflag, standing proudly by my desk, is the first thing I see when I go \nto work in the morning and the last thing I see when I leave to go home \nat night.\n  I remember, too, the friends I lost in Vietnam. I remember escorting \nthe body of a fellow pilot to his home and presenting the American flag \nto his widow. The flag is our country's ultimate tribute to a fallen \nsoldier.\n  So it is with strong feelings--right here in my stomach and right \nhere in my heart--of rage and disgust that I view those who would \ndesecrate my flag, defile my memories, and dishonor my heritage.\n  I think back to my days flying jets in the Navy.\n  I think of the friends I had, and the friends I continue to have as a \nproud member of American Legion Post 562 in my hometown of Cumming, IA.\n  Over the years, I have turned to my fellow veterans to see how they \nwould vote on such an amendment. Some were for, some against. But I \nhave been most impressed by the arguments of those who oppose a flag \ndesecration amendment.\n  Frankly, I expected my neighbor, who earned five Purple Hearts in \ncombat, to be gung-ho for a constitutional amendment. But he told me he \nwas absolutely opposed to an amendment. He said, ``I fought for \nfreedom. I didn't fight for doing away with freedom.''\n  An Iowa veteran I met at a coffee shop had this common-sense \nperspective. Speaking of the flag-burner in the case of Texas v. \nJohnson, he said: ``Look, this flag burner, this Greg Johnson, he's \njust one of a handful of kooks. Should we change the Bill of Rights, \nwhich has never been changed, for a handful of kooks?''\n  Most moving to me was the article I read years ago in the Cedar \nRapids Gazette by a former prisoner of war, James Warner.\n  Let me read to you part of his article:\n\n       It hurts me to see other Americans willfully desecrate the \n     flag. But I have been in a communist prison where I looked \n     into the pit of hell. I cannot compromise on freedom. It \n     hurts to see the flag burned, but I part company with those \n     who want to punish the flag burners.\n\n  Mr. Warner went on to recount how, in a North Vietnamese prison camp, \nhe was given a choice: He could renounce his country and leave, or stay \nand be tortured. James Warner chose to stay. The North Vietnamese tried \nto break his spirit but they couldn't. During one interrogation, his \ncaptor showed him a photograph of some Americans protesting the war by \nburning a flag.\n  ``There,'' the North Vietnamese officer told him, ``People in your \ncountry protest against your cause. That proves you are wrong.''\n  ``No,'' Warner said, ``That proves I am right. In my country we are \nnot afraid of freedom, even if it means that people disagree with us.''\n  In that moment, the interrogator was on his feet--his face purple \nwith rage, according to Warner's account. There was also pain in the \ninterrogator's eyes, compounded by fear. The Communist feared freedom; \nonly freedom could be used to defeat him.\n  Likewise, in 1989, the Chinese Communists feared the students in \nTianamen Square who burned the Chinese flag. The students' protests \nwere silenced with tanks and guns. As communism crumbled across Eastern \nEurope in the late 1980s, expressions of freedom took many forms: \nprotests, speeches, underground newspapers, strikes--and yes, even flag \ndesecrations. And when we saw those torn and burned flags, symbols of \nCommunist domination, did we denounce these protestors for defiling \ntheir own State symbols? Of course not. We praised them for their acts \nof political defiance. Burning and tearing their flags represented a \npowerful act of political speech, a denunciation of the communist \nregimes that had oppressed those countries for decades.\n  And once the Communist regimes began to fall, what came next? Calls \nfor Western-style guarantees of rights to freedom of the press, freedom \nof association, and freedom of speech. Many called for a constitution. \nThey knew what some of us seem to forget: That the only way those \nfreedoms can be protected is with an inviolable Bill of Rights such as \nour own. A Bill of Rights that has stood unchanged for more than two \ncenturies--despite Civil War, Depression, two world wars, and powerful \ninternal movements of dissent. Even at those times of profound turmoil, \nwe resisted any temptation to amend the Bill of Rights.\n  As a veteran, I will never, ever do anything to show disrespect for \nthe flag. At the same time, I will never, ever do anything that would \ndiminish the freedom our flag represents.\n  In our churches, synagogues, and mosques, we are taught not to \nworship the idols of our faith, but rather the ideals of our faith. \nLikewise, patriotism is not measured, first and foremost, by our love \nfor the flag as a physical object, but by our love for the rights and \nideas the flag stands for.\n  I do not want to see the flag become another Golden Calf--an object \nto be worshipped for the sake of worshipping. The flag is only as \npowerful as the republic--and the rights and ideals--for which it \nstands.\n  Back in 1990, when the Senate first debated--and rejected--a flag \ndesecration amendment, I remember reading a letter to the editor of the \nBurlington, IA, Hawkeye, written by a World War II veteran who had \nvolunteered for duty. He wrote:\n\n       I served my country under the flag. I pledged allegiance to \n     the American flag, and to the Republic for which it stands. \n     `Stands' is the key. The flag stands for the government. The \n     government guarantees us free speech. My allegiance is to the \n     flag however it is displayed, cloth, paper, paint, or the one \n     that waves continuously in my mind. That one, in order to \n     burn, they would need to burn me. I like the Bill of Rights \n     just as it is. Exactly what the flag stands for.\n\n  So wrote the veteran from Mount Pleasant, IA. And he concluded with \nthese words: ``Isn't it better to put up with a few disgusting \nfrustrating acts of free speech than to open a Pandora's box?''\n  I have to agree with his characterization of this amendment as a \n``Pandora's box'' which, once opened, could lead to other proposals to \npunch holes in the Bill of Rights.\n  Mr. President, I hope that the Senate will reject this amendment, \nonce again. But I believe this debate can have a positive legacy--not \nby diminishing our rights as citizens, but by increasing public \ndisplays of the flag, increasing people's knowledge and understanding \nof the flag's history, and increasing good citizenship and public \nservice.\n  We are proud of the flag. Let us fly the flag.\n  We are proud of the flag. Let us tell our children and grandchildren \nabout what that flag represents, what it means and why so many died for \nit.\n  That flag in my mother's house was not used as a tablecloth, it was \nnot used as a scarf, it was not used as a piece of clothing. I grew up \nbelieving there was a proper way to hold the flag, a right way to \ndisplay it. We need to take it a step further and educate people, young \nand old, as to the meaning behind the symbols--behind the flag and our \nBill of Rights.\n  Mr. President, next week we celebrate 230 years since our Declaration \nof Independence. Fireworks will recall the `rocket's red glare' and the \n`bombs bursting' overhead when those who were first to wear the uniform \nof the United States Armed Forces put their lives on the line.\n  And in all of our 50 States, the American flag will be hailed, waving \nin the breeze over courthouses and city halls, public buildings and \nprivate homes. Pride will be felt and respect shown, not because it is \nmandated by law, but because it is embedded in our hearts.\n  I can think of no more patriotic way to celebrate the Fourth of July, \nno better way to show respect for the American flag and for the \nprinciples for which it stands, than by voting against this proposed \namendment to the Bill of Rights.\n\n[[Page S6528]]\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to support in the strongest \nterms the proposed constitutional amendment to grant the States and \nCongress the power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of \nthe United States.\n  Our flag occupies a truly unique place in the hearts of millions of \ncitizens as a solemn and sacred banner of freedom. As a national emblem \nof the world's greatest democracy, the American flag should be treated \nwith unyielding respect and scrupulous care.\n  At this time when Americans are fighting and, tragically, perishing \nunder the flag of the United States, it is long overdue that we pass a \nconstitutional amendment to protect that very symbol of American ideals \nfrom acts of desecration. We lost the effort by just 4 votes 6 years \nago in the Senate. Meanwhile, the other body has done its duty and \npassed a bill twice. We in this chamber must finally do the right thing \nand protect our flag once and for all and for all time\n  With the introduction of this resolution, we resume our effort to \nprotect the greatest symbol of the American story and American \nexperience. There is no more powerful example of freedom, democracy, \nand our steadfast commitment to those principles than the American flag \n, and it is altogether fitting and just that we try to ensure that it \nis publicly displayed with pride, dignity, and honor.\n  I cannot underscore the point enough that the flag is not merely a \nvisual icon to us, nor should it be. The American flag is not just \nanother piece of cloth. It is not just another banner or logo or \nemblem. It is our revered testament to all that we have defended and \nprotected. Too many Americans have contributed too much and sacrificed \ntoo much . . . their labor, their passion, and in many cases their \nlives for the flag to be simply and frivolously regarded. The flag \npermeates our national history and relays the story of America in its \nmost direct, and most eloquent terms. Indeed, knowing how the flag has \nchanged--and in what ways it has remained constant--is to know the \nprofound history and limitless hopes of this country.\n  More than 220 years ago, a year after the colonies had made their \nhistoric decision to declare independence from Britain, the Second \nContinental Congress decided that the American flag would consist of 13 \nred and white alternating stripes and 13 white stars in a field of \nblue. These stars and blue field were to represent a new constellation \nin which freedom and government of the people, by the people and for \nthe people would rule. The colors of the flag are representative, as \nwell. Red was to represent hardiness and valor, white was to represent \npurity and innocence and blue was to represent vigilance, perseverance \nand justice. And as we all know, the constellation has grown to include \n50 stars, but the number of stripes has remained constant. In this way, \nthe flag tells all who view it that no matter how large America may \nbecome, she is forever rooted in the bedrock principles of freedom and \nself-government that led those first 13 colonies to forge a new nation.\n  Even more significant is the fact that the flag also represents our \nenduring pledge to uphold these ideals. This dedication has exacted a \nhigh human toll, for which many of America's best and brightest have \ngiven their last full measure of devotion. It is in their memories and \nfor their ultimate sacrifice to America's ideals that I am proud to \nsupport this amendment.\n  Make no mistake, this amendment is necessary because the Supreme \nCourt, in its 1990 U.S. verses Eichman ruling, held that burning the \nflag in political protest was constitutionally protected free speech. \nNo one holds our right to free speech more dearly than I do. But I have \nlong held that our free speech rights do not entitle us to consider the \nflag as merely personal property, to be treated any way we see fit, \nincluding its desecration for the purpose of political protest. The \nfact is the Eichman decision unnecessarily rejects the deeply held \nreverence millions of Americans have for our flag. With all the forums \nfor public opinion available to Americans every day, from television \nand radio, to newspapers and Internet chat rooms, Americans are \nafforded ample opportunity to freely and fully exercise their first \namendment rights, even if what they have to say is overwhelmingly \nunpopular with a majority of American citizens. At the heart of the \nissue is respect. I applaud the right to protest and to assemble in \norder to express opinion, dissent, or a point of view. Write letters to \nthe editor. Start a website. Create a blog. Organize. Leaflet. March. \nChant. Speak out. Petition. Do any and all of these things but do not \nburn our flag.\n  As we consider this amendment, we must also remember that it is \ncarefully drafted to simply allow the Congress and individual State \nlegislatures to enact laws prohibiting the physical desecration of the \nflag, if they so choose. It certainly does not stipulate or require \nthat such laws be enacted, although many States and the Federal \nGovernment have already demonstrated widespread support for doing so. \nIn fact, 48 States, including my own State of Maine, along with the \nFederal Government, have had antiflag burning laws on their books for \nyears and that was prior to the Supreme Court's rulings on this issue. \nSo, in effect, what this resolution does is simply give the American \nflag the protection that almost all the States, the Federal Government, \nand a large majority of the American people have already endorsed.\n  Whether our flag is flying over the U.S. Capitol, a State house, a \nmilitary base, a school, Fenway Park, or on a flag pole on Main Street, \nthe stars and stripes represent the ideals and values that are the \nfoundation of this great Nation. Our flag has come to not only \nrepresent the pride we have for our Nation's past glories, but also to \nstand for the hope we all harbor for our Nation's future.\n  Perhaps it was The Reverend Henry Ward Beecher who captured best the \nessence of the flag's meaning and symbolism more than a century ago \nwhen he wrote that ``a thoughtful mind, when it sees a nation's flag, \nsees not the flag only, but the nation itself and whatever may be its \nsymbols, its insignia, he reads chiefly in the flag the government, the \nprinciples, the truths, the history which belongs to the nation that \nsets it forth.''\n  Mr. President, our flag represents not just the new constellation of \nfreedom envisioned by our forebears, but the distillation of that \nfreedom, too everything that was behind the forming of our nation and \neverything that informs our nation and who we are to this day. So, it \nis with undaunted pride and unwavering hope that I urge my colleagues \nto support this amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the flag \nprotection amendment, S.J. Res. 12.\n  This amendment was precipitated by the Supreme Court's ruling in \nTexas v. Johnson, which overturned a law which prohibited flag burning. \nThe ruling made the burning of the American flag a legitimate exercise \nof free speech.\n  I believe freedom of speech, guaranteed in the first amendment, is \none of the fundamental freedoms the Founding Fathers sought to protect \nsince it is the basis for every other freedom we enjoy. However, in the \npast the Supreme Court has ruled that freedom of speech is not an \nabsolute freedom. For example, it is unlawful to yell ``fire'' in a \ncrowded auditorium, and it is also illegal to threaten to harm the \nPresident of the United States.\n  I disagree with the Supreme Court's analysis of flag burning. The \nSupreme Court erred in equating free speech with the desecration of the \nAmerican flag. The act of desecrating the American flag goes beyond \nmerely expressing a point of view--it is a violent act against the \nsymbol of our Nation. It is not an act of free speech. Every American \nis free to denounce our Nation and ideals for which the flag stands. \nFrankly, I think it would be terribly misguided, but if that is what \nthey want to say, they have the right to say it. There is a vast \ndifference, however, between speaking one's mind and desecrating the \nsymbol of our Nation.\n  The American flag is a unifying symbol of our Nation and is \nconsidered by many to be the physical embodiment of the founding \nprinciples of this country. The predominance our flag holds in the \nnational psyche was reconfirmed after the September 11 attacks, when \nthe vision of the red, white and blue galvanized our Nation.\n  The American flag is not just a piece of cloth. It is a symbol of \nfreedom and of the sacrifice it takes to gain that freedom. The red \nstripes are there to\n\n[[Page S6529]]\n\nremind us of the blood that was and continues to be shed in defense of \nthis Nation.\n  I have the deepest reverence for the U.S. Constitution, and I do not \nbelieve it should be amended casually. However, in this case, I believe \nthe American flag and all it represents deserves the protection of our \nlaws. Therefore, I have decided to support a constitutional amendment \nthat would require due respect for this great symbol of freedom.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I understand the desire of my colleagues \nto defend the flag, and I share their outrage at the despicable conduct \nthat some families of fallen servicemembers have had to endure as they \nbid farewell to their loved ones. But I cannot support the substitute \namendment offered by the senior Senator from Illinois. The Supreme \nCourt has twice held that criminalizing flag desecration violates the \nfirst amendment. Flag burning is unacceptable, but outlawing certain \nforms of flag destruction based on the message that the misguided \nperson is trying to convey raises obvious first amendment problems.\n  The vast majority of flag desecration incidents can be prosecuted \nunder criminal trespass, destruction of private property, and other \nState and local criminal statutes. We do not need a Federal statute to \nhandle the handful of other incidents that occur each year, and we \ncertainly should not amend the Constitution to make such a statute \npossible.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today this Chamber considers whether to \nsend a constitutional amendment to the States and people of the United \nStates, a United States that is represented by that glorious flag that \nstands to your right, Mr. President.\n  This is not the first time the people's elected representatives have \nacted to protect the flag, but as a result of a willful judicial \nresolve, we are forced to take this decisive action as the people's \nduly elected policymakers.\n  I find it highly doubtful that the Framers intended the first \namendment to cover flag desecration as protected speech. I find it even \nmore unlikely that they intended the courts to be able to tell Congress \nthat it cannot protect our flag. Quoting Alexander Hamilton, in The \nFederalist No. 78, it is Congress who ``prescribes the rules by which \nthe duties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated,'' not the \ncourts. This is a principle I have consistently stood for and will \nstand for again when I vote in favor of S.J. Res. 12. When I see images \non the news of different groups around the world burning American \nflags, it sickens my stomach. That is not speech: that is chaos. That \nis the mob mentality that is rebelliousness. That is conduct that \nappeals to the deepest and darkest parts of human nature. That is not \nthe kind of riotous conduct that should be protected in this Nation; \nthis amendment will allow us to make that clear once and for all.\n  I have heard some say--Justice Brennan in Eichmann--that allowing \nprotesters to burn the flag is the greatest tribute to that flag, that \nwhat the flag stands for allows those who hate it to abuse it. Though I \nunderstand the merits of this argument, I disagree that it gives any \nkind of real reason to allow this behavior. This pseudo reverent \njustification could also defend spitting on our soldiers returning from \nduty or the hateful, vile-spewing protesters who want to defile the \nfunerals of our Nation's heroes. After all, it is our soldiers who give \nthese protesters a free country in which to protest.\n  Opponents say that one has a right to burn the flag. I say that we \nhave a right not to have our flag burned. Countless soldiers and \ncitizens have given their lives defending what this flag stands for. It \nis time that we, as the Congress of the United States, stand up and \ndefend our flag, that we recognize that our national symbol that \nrepresents our system of laws is worthy of the protection of our laws.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the amendment we are debating is short \nand to the point. It contains only 17 words:\n\n       Congress shall have the power to prohibit the physical \n     desecration of the flag of the United States.\n\n  We are discussing this today because in 1989, in Texas v. Johnson, \nfive members of the Supreme Court held that flag desecration--\nspecifically burning the American flag--was a form of first amendment-\nprotected speech and Texas's law banning desecration of the flag was \nunconstitutional. Adding insult to injury, when Congress passed the \nFlag Protection Act of 1989, codified as title 18, section 700 of the \nUnited States Code, five members of the Supreme Court struck down that \nlaw as unconstitutional, too, in United States v. Eichman, 1990.\n  I believe the amendment we are considering today is entirely \nappropriate, and I am proud to cosponsor it. I wish to respond briefly \nto some of the criticism I have heard. Some would say: Well, you want \nto limit free speech when you want to stop burning the flag.\n  Now, it is true that the Supreme Court, by a 5-to-4 majority, held \nthat the act of burning a flag is free speech. Well, I don't agree. The \nSupreme Court for a long time has allowed reasonable ``time, place, and \nmanner'' restrictions on speech.\n  Moreover, the Supreme Court has long recognized that:\n\n       [t]here are certain well-defined and narrowly limited \n     classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which \n     have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem. \n     These include the lewd and obscene, the profane, the \n     libelous, and the insulting or `fighting' words--those which \n     by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an \n     immediate breach of the peace.\n\n  The late Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote in his dissent in Texas v. \nJohnson: ``Far from being a case of `one picture being worth a thousand \nwords,' flag burning is the equivalent of an inarticulate grunt or roar \nthat, it seems fair to say, is most likely to be indulged in not to \nexpress any particular idea, but to antagonize others.'' It is not \nreally ``speech'' at all, but if you consider it some sort of \nexpression, it is certainly inarticulate. It is not of great value \ncompared to the unifying symbol of the flag.\n  The first amendment is about intelligent debate, argument, concern \nover policy issues--not whether you get to ``grunt'' or ``roar'' by \nburning a flag. I don't believe flag-burning was ever intended to be \ncovered by the Constitution. So I believe the Supreme Court got it \nwrong in Texas v. Johnson and United States v. Eichman.\n  More importantly, the American people agree that the Supreme Court \ngot it wrong. All 50 States have asked Congress to propose an amendment \nprohibiting flag desecration. In our democracy, the people have the \nlast say on the Constitution. If the people think the Supreme Court is \nwrong, they have every right to amend the Constitution and tell it so.\n  In my view, the flag of the United States is a unique object, and \nprohibiting its desecration will not in any fundamental way alter the \nfree expression of ideas in this country.\n  It seems to me if burning the flag is speech and if the Court is \ncorrect in saying it is speech and the people of the United States care \ndeeply about protecting the flag, then they should adopt a restricted, \nnarrow constitutional amendment that would allow Congress to stop flag \ndesecration.\n  Indeed, it would be healthy for this country to adopt a \nconstitutional amendment that would allow the protection of the flag. \nMore Medals of Honor have been awarded for preserving and fighting to \npreserve the flag than any other. We know the stories of battle when \ntime after time the soldier carrying the flag is the target of the \nenemy. When he fell, another one would pick it up. When he fell, \nanother one would pick it up. When he fell, another one would pick it \nup. That is the history.\n  We pledge allegiance to the flag, not the Constitution, not the \nDeclaration of Independence. We pledge allegiance to the flag because \nit is a unifying symbol for America, and having a special protection \nfor it is quite logical to me.\n  I do not believe we should never amend the Constitution. I do not \nthink we amend the Constitution enough. But we want to have good \namendments that are necessary, that are important, that enrich us, and \nthat make us a stronger nation. In 1816, Thomas Jefferson wrote: ``Some \nmen look at constitutions with sanctimonious reverence, and deem them \nlike the ark of the covenant, too sacred to be touched.'' Jefferson \ndisagreed and proposed amending a constitution every 20 years or so so \nthat it could ``be handed\n\n[[Page S6530]]\n\non, with periodical repairs, from generation to generation, to the end \nof time, if anything human can last so long.''\n  I don't know whether we need to amend the Constitution every 20 \nyears, as Thomas Jefferson proposed, but I do think a constitutional \namendment is a healthy way for us to remind ourselves that this Nation \nis a democratic republic. We are not a nation under the rule of the \nSupreme Court. The Constitution belongs to ``We the People of the \nUnited States,'' as its preamble states--not the judiciary of the \nUnited States. The Constitution was democratically adopted. It was \nmeant to be democratically amended. It must remain democratically \naccountable--or lose its legitimacy as the foundation for a democratic \nrepublic.\n  Let me finally address one more concern about the language of this \namendment. It is short. It is concise. And it leaves it to Congress to \naddress the details on what specific forms of conduct to prohibit. I \ntrust Congress to do that. Congress did it in 1989 with the Flag \nProtection Act codified at title 18, section 700 of the United States \nCode.\n  Concern has been expressed that the term ``desecration'' is too \nbroad, too vague. I don't think so. I think it will clearly grant \nCongress the power it needs without any restriction on our great \nfreedoms, particularly real speech.\n  Mr. President, the flag of the United States is a unique, unifying \nsymbol of our country and all it embodies. Brave men and women have \nfought and died for that flag and what it represents. Let us today act \nto protect the flag and adopt S.J. Res. 12.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S.J. Res. 12 \nwhich proposes an amendment to our Constitution allowing Congress to \nprohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States. I \nam proud to be an original cosponsor of the resolution introduced by my \ncolleague from Utah.\n  Throughout the years of our Nation's existence, many brave men and \nwomen have fought and died to defend the freedom that our flag \nsymbolizes. We must honor their memory by protecting our flag and \npreserving this symbol of our Nation and the unity of the 50 States. I \nhave heard from veterans across my home State of Wyoming about their \nservice and the importance of the flag in both their military and \ncivilian lives. Our flag is a constant reminder of all those who have \nsacrificed so much so that we might be free.\n  We are now engaged in a new and different kind of war. We have taken \nup arms to end the threat of terror. We have been joined by many \ndifferent nations in that effort, but we are, once again, relying on \nour own Armed Forces, the greatest fighting force in the world. With \nthe talents and abilities of our service members and our support and \nprayers, I have no doubt they will get the job done.\n  When our deployed troops return home, they will deserve our support \nand encouragement as they return to their everyday lives. I believe \nthey will also expect us to take action to ensure the symbol of our \nNation that they carried with them into battle is afforded the \nprotection it deserves. We must ensure our flag is respected and \nprotected as a symbol of our freedoms and the sacrifices that were \nmade.\n  Over the last couple of days, some Members of this body have made \nsome misleading statements about what this resolution does. Let's be \nclear--this piece of legislation does not ban anything. It does begin \nthe process of restoring the authority of Congress to pass a flag \ndesecration statute. A constitutional amendment will only become law if \nit is approved by three-quarters of the States.\n  I have also heard some of my colleagues claim that the language we \nare debating is too vague. Again, this is simply the first step in a \nprocess. The details will be debated once Congress regains its \nauthority to make laws related to the desecration of the flag. It is \nthen the job of those in Congress to talk about and debate the \ndefinition of desecration and what that word will mean in our laws.\n  Again, I believe our flag should be protected as a symbol of this \nNation and our history. It represents us in military actions, in \nathletic competitions, diplomacy, and any activity we engage in around \nthe world. The flag helped rally the Nation after the attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001. It calls to mind those who serve on our police, \nfire, and emergency response teams, risking their lives every day to \nensure we are safe and protected from harm.\n  Diana and I have a friend from Finland who taught in the United \nStates for a year. She had a flag of Finland that she traveled with \nwhile we were debating a flag burning amendment. She couldn't believe \nthat anyone would dishonor their country's flag by burning it. As a \nsymbol of the country, she couldn't believe that anyone would desecrate \nit in any way. She couldn't imagine that burning or desecrating the \nflag of a person's own country could have any positive effect. She \nbelieved that what people were doing to the symbol of our Nation would \nhave a very detrimental effect overseas.\n  Changing the law may not change people, but the discussion alone that \nwe are having should point out what is right and wrong and how other \ncountries view the disrespect we demonstrate for our country. People \nare missing the issue of the protests. They are only seeing the \ndisrespect for the country. We can do better. We must do better. This \namendment will help us do better on focusing on problems instead of \ndrama that takes away from ways we can make our lives and our country \nbetter.\n  Our flag symbolizes our hope for the future and our willingness to \nwork together to make this world a better place for us all to live. \nThat hope for tomorrow unites us, guides us, and helps to make us truly \none Nation under God, with liberty and justice for all.\n  I encourage all Senators to support S.J. Res. 12.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, the America flag is such an important \nsymbol to our country that from the time we are children, we salute the \nflag with a hand over our hearts and pledge our allegiance to the flag \nof the United States of America. For the past two centuries, in battles \nall around the globe, the American flag has served as an inspiration \nand rallying point for our Armed Forces fighting for the ideals it \nembodies. We hold the flag with such reverence that it covers the \ncoffin of America's military heroes who have dedicated their lives to \nthe service of our Nation. Old Glory should be revered and protected \nbecause it represents American History, American sacrifice, and hope \nfor our Nation's future.\n  On the Fourth of July, especially, we are reminded of the sacrifices \nof our forefathers in founding this great Nation, and the American flag \nsymbolizes that sacrifice. The act of burning or destroying the flag \nshows a tremendous disrespect for our forefathers and the countless men \nand women who have given their lives to make the United States what it \nis today. That's why I am an original cosponsor of the flag protection \namendment, and I rise to speak in support of it today.\n  By supporting this amendment, I believe that I am supporting the will \nof the people of Louisiana and the American people. I have received so \nmany phone calls, letters, and e-mails from people in my home State of \nLouisiana in support of a constitutional amendment to prevent the \ndesecration of our American flag. Polls show an overwhelming majority \nof Americans believe that burning the U.S. flag should be a crime. \nAccording to Fox News poll when asked, ``Do you think burning the \nAmerican flag should be legal or illegal?'', 73 percent respondents \nsaid they thought it should be illegal.\n  Before the Supreme Court issued its decision in Texas v. Johnson, \ndeclaring that flag burning is politically expressive conduct protected \nby the first amendment, 48 States, including Louisiana, and the \nDistrict of Columbia, had enacted statutes prohibiting the physical \ndesecration of the American flag. In my opinion, the Johnson decision \nis just one more example of unelected activist judges ignoring the will \nof the American people. In response to the Court's decision in Johnson, \nCongress enacted the Flag Protection Act. However, in U.S. v. Eichman \nthe Court struck down the Flag Protection Act, holding that \nGovernment's interest in protecting this symbol did not outweigh the \nindividual's right to politically expressive conduct.\n  Since the Supreme Court issued these 2 decisions, all 50 States have \npassed resolutions asking Congress to pass a constitutional amendment \nthat would\n\n[[Page S6531]]\n\nprovide some protection to the American flag. This is overwhelming \nevidence that the American people disagree with these activist decision \nand believe that the flag--the symbol of Our nation--should be \nprotected. I believe that we as Senators owe it to our constituents--as \ntheir elected representatives--to support this amendment and give \nCongress the power to enact a law banning the physical desecration of \nthe U.S. Flag.\n\n  The Flag Protection Amendment gives Congress the power to enact laws \nprohibiting the ``physical desecration'' of the flag. This amendment \ndoes not ban flag burning--it doesn't ban anything. It merely gives \nCongress the power to enact legislation if and only if three-fourth of \nthe States ratify the amendment within 7 years. Therefore, this \namendment would place the power back into the hands of the American \npeople, which, in my mind, is much better than leaving it in the hands \nof activist judges.\n  Opponents of this amendment state that any laws prohibiting physical \ndesecration of the flag, no matter how narrowly tailored, violate an \nindividual's first Amendment right to free speech. However, while the \nfirst amendment grants Americans the precious right to free speech, \nthat right is not without limitations. For example, the Supreme Court \nhas held that certain types of hate speech and obscenity are not \ncovered under the first amendment. Additionally, public school teachers \nmay not espouse their personal religious views in the classroom, and \nattorneys and doctors cannot breach the confidence of their clients.\n  The first amendment protects a number of avenues for individuals to \nvoice their dissent, but it should not protect the physical desecration \nof the symbol that embodies the spirit of our Nation.\n  It is time for the Senate to pass the flag protection amendment--an \namendment that has overwhelming bipartisan support and 59 cosponsors. \nThe House passed this amendment last year by two-third majority. Now it \nis time for the Senate to pass this amendment so that we can send it to \nStates and give the American people a chance to vote on this very \nimportant legislation. Mr. President, I believe that protecting the \nsymbol of our Nation is one of our duties as elected representatives of \nthe American people, and it is too important to leave in the hands of \nactivist judges.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I share with my colleagues my \nthoughts on S.J. Res. 12 to amend the Constitution of the United States \nto prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States. \nThere are good, thoughtful, and patriotic Americans on both sides of \nthis contentious issue. I have great respect for the views of many that \namendment would constitute an unnecessary and harmful interference with \nthe first amendment guarantees of free speech. Nonetheless, I am a \nsupporter of S.J Res. 12. For most of America's history, flag \ndesecration has been illegal under State law and local ordinances. This \nconstitutional amendment allows the return of the law to its former \nstate, and I support this amendment to ensure those protections.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, whether flying on an aircraft carrier, \nhanging in one of our Embassies, or worn as a patch on a soldier's \nuniform, the American flag stands for freedom.\n  The vast majority of Americans honor the flag, and rightly so. Some \nwould go so far as to amend the Constitution to protect the flag \nagainst those who would burn it. While I share and admire their \npatriotism, weakening the first amendment, even for the noble purpose \nof protecting the flag, is not a position I can support.\n  Make no mistake I treasure the Stars and Stripes as much as any \nAmerican. One of my most prized possessions is the flag which honored \nmy father's military service in World War II. It was draped upon his \ncoffin after his death from cancer in 1990. He fought in the European \ntheater to protect the freedoms that flag represents, and it now rests \nproudly on the mantle in my Senate office.\n  I do not have any sympathy for any who would dare desecrate the flag. \nThey demean the service of millions of Americans, including my father \nand the brave men and women currently fighting the war on terror. They \ndeserve rebuke and condemnation.\n  There may be no greater symbol of freedom than the flag. Its powerful \nsymbolism is precisely why miscreants choose to desecrate it to make \ntheir point. They intend to convey a powerful message, and they have \nsucceeded, because we find their message so disgusting that proponents \nof S.J. Res. 12 seek to ban their message. But freedom of speech means \nnothing unless people are allowed to express views that are offensive \nand repugnant to others.\n  Over 60 years ago, Justice Jackson noted how much the flag means to \nall Americans, and at the same time argued that the principles of \nliberty require us to allow others to view the flag differently than we \nsee it ourselves. He wrote that:\n\n       The case is made difficult not because the principles of \n     its decision are obscure but because the flag involved is our \n     own . . . But freedom to differ is not limited to things that \n     do not matter much. That would be a mere shadow of freedom.\n\n  Since our founding, we have watched other nations silence dissent, \nwhile America welcomed it--and America has prevailed. In fact, the \nSenate has seen free and open debate this week about the flag \nresolution. Those who support the resolution have made their best \narguments to try to convince those who disagree. Regardless of the \noutcome of the vote on this measure, this week's debate is good for \ndemocracy and good for America.\n  Free and open debate is also the correct approach to use in dealing \nwith those who desecrate the flag. The Supreme Court has recognized \nthat ``[t]he way to preserve the flag's special role is not to punish \nthose who feel differently about these matters. It is to persuade them \nthat they are wrong.''\n  Flag burning is an abominable act. We are lucky to live in a country \nwhere the overwhelming majority of people not only reject it, but honor \nthe American flag and the freedoms it stands for. These freedoms are \nAmerica's source of strength, whether embodied in the first amendment's \nprotection of speech, or the second amendment's protection of the right \nto bear arms, or the fifth amendment's protection of private property, \nor in any other provision of our enduring Constitution.\n  Ultimately, people who use the flag to convey a message of protest \npose little harm to our country. But weakening our first amendment \nfreedoms might.\n  Our Founding Fathers wrote the first amendment because they believed \nthat, even with all the excesses and offenses that freedom of speech \nwould undoubtedly allow, truth and reason would triumph in the end. And \nthey believed the answer to offensive speech was not to regulate it, \nbut to counter it with more speech, and in so doing, let the truth \nprevail in the marketplace of ideas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator's time has expired.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \namendment be agreed to and that the following amendment be the only \namendment in order to the pending joint resolution, S.J. Res. 12: \nDurbin first-degree amendment relating to statutory language. I further \nask consent that all debate be equally divided between the two leaders \nor their designees until 5:30; and further, at that time the Senate \nproceed to a vote in relation to the Durbin amendment; further that the \nresolution then be read a third time and the Senate proceed to a vote \non passage of S.J. Res. 12, as amended, with no further intervening \naction or debate; provided further that if all 100 Senators fail to \nvote on final passage, then the vote be reconsidered and the Senate \nvote again on final passage on Thursday, June 29, at a time determined \nby the two leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would \nfurther ask that the consent agreement contain the understanding that \nthe Durbin first-degree amendment relating to statutory language be the \nonly amendment that would be in order.\n  Mr. FRIST. Without objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is part of the agreement.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So it is clear, I will have an up-or-down vote on my \namendment.\n\n[[Page S6532]]\n\n  Mr. REID. At 5:30.\n  Mr. DURBIN. But it will be an up-or-down vote directly on the \namendment; is that understood?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I would like to just clarify the \nunanimous consent request so that Members who are on the floor are not \nexcluded from the debate that is going on.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Frist and I will allocate the time that is left.\n  Mr. BUNNING. But there is time allocated presently.\n  Mr. FRIST. That is correct, Mr. President. Through the Chair, time \nhas been allocated. The remainder of the time will be allocated between \nthe two of us, and there is nothing in the unanimous consent request \nthat will interfere with that.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I think Senator Kerry had asked for some \nadditional time, and it is cutting our time on this side. I want to \nmake sure we restore that time we would have lost.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think that is very appropriate. I believe \nthe extra time Senator Kerry took from the Republicans should be \nrestored. It would be about 5 minutes, I think.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, just briefly, on our side, because I can \ntell there is some confusion as to the order, I have Senator Bunning \nfor 10 minutes, Senator Allard for 7 minutes, Senator Warner for 7 \nminutes, and Senator Thune for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise in support of S.J. Res. 12, the \nflag protection constitutional amendment. It is fitting for the Senate \nto address this issue on the eve of the Nation's most celebrated \nnational holiday, the Fourth of July.\n  For over 200 years, from the time of the Revolutionary War to this \nvery moment, the American flag has served as the most unifying and \nvisible sign of our great Nation. It is a symbol that knows no \nparticular political affiliation or ideology. It is a symbol that has \nmany different meanings for many different people. And, most \nimportantly, it is a symbol of our Nation's greatest freedom that so \nmany men and women in our Armed Forces have and continue to sacrifice \nto protect.\n  I believe it is an insult to those sacrifices to stand idly by while \nthe flag is desecrated. It is time to show the same honor to our flag \nthat we do to those who have sacrificed to protect it. I believe we owe \nit to our Old Glory, and that is why I am here today to speak in \nsupport of the constitutional amendment to protect our flag.\n  This amendment is necessary to restore protections for the flag that \nthe Supreme Court wiped away in 1989, ruling in Texas v. Johnson. In \nthat 5-to-4 ruling, the Court set aside longstanding national and State \nlaws that protected our flag and recognized and honored its place in \nAmerican society.\n  Congress quickly acted in response to that ruling through the passage \nof the Flag Protection Act of 1989. The Supreme Court, however, was \nalso quick to act. In another 5-to-4 decision, in 1990, the Court again \nfound that flag protections were inconsistent with their view of the \nrights protected by the first amendment.\n  But the Court is once again out of touch with America. Its view that \nflag burning should be protected is not shared by many Americans. In \nfact, the vast majority of Americans think just the opposite. \nNationwide, over 70 percent of Americans think it is important for us \nto pass a law to protect the flag. And in my State, that number is even \nhigher--87 percent think that it is important that we act now to \nprotect the flag.\n  It is time that we turn this issue back to the people. The \nConstitution provides an amending process for a reason. The bar to \nenact a constitutional amendment is high, requiring a two-thirds vote \nof both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Likewise, the \namendment must be ratified by three-fourths of the States. But in the \nrare instance when those super-majorities can be assembled, the Framers \ngave us away to change the Constitution and for the people's voice to \nbe heard. That is just what we should and must do.\n  Since the Supreme Court's rulings, the House of Representatives \npassed a flag protection amendment five times--most recently last year. \nThe Senate has also taken up the issue, but unfortunately failed to get \nthe necessary 67 votes. By all accounts, this time the Senate is within \none vote of adopting the amendment and sending it to the States for \nratification.\n  I have no doubt that should the Senate pass this resolution it would \nbe ratified by the States. While this issue is currently being debated \nat the national level, States have been quick to show their \noverwhelming support for such a resolution. Since 1989, all 50 States \nhave enacted resolutions asking Congress to pass a flag protection \namendment.\n  Mr. President, we owe it to Old Glory to protect each and everyone of \nit stars and stripes.\n  Two weeks ago, I had the honor of introducing a man who fought to \nrescue Old Glory from would-be flag-burners. Rick Monday, a former \ncenter fielder for the Chicago Cubs and a Marine Corps Reservist, \nrescued the American flag from being burnt by two protestors during a \n1976 baseball game between the Cubs and the Dodgers.\n  Monday was playing center field for the Cubs that day, when suddenly \nin the 4th inning two protesters ran onto the outfield grass carrying \nthe American flag. These two individuals then proceeded to spread the \nflag on the ground, dousing it with lighter fluid and pulling out \nmatches to light it on fire. But before they could act, Monday dashed \nfrom his position swiping the flag right out from under their noses to \nthe sound of thunderous cheers from the crowd.\n  Following Monday's patriotic actions those in attendance that day \nburst into a chorus of God Bless America. Whether you are a player or a \nfan, we all have our favorite memories from America's past time, but \nfew of those moments compare to Monday's act of patriotism. It is \narguably one of the greatest moments the game has ever seen. In fact, \nthe Baseball Hall of Fame recognized it as one of the 100 Classic \nMoments in the history of baseball. Monday, a true American Patriot, \nfought to stop what he knew was wrong in 1976 and is still wrong today.\n  Some may argue that burning the flag is a form of speech. I do not \nagree with those people. In the 1989 flag burning case Texas v. \nJohnson, late Chief Justice William Rehnquist said it well in his \ndissent when he said that flag burning is more like a grunt or roar \ndesigned to antagonize others than it is a form of speech.\n  Well, Mr. President, it is time that this body acted to protect Old \nGlory from those who wish to indulge in its desecration. We owe it to \nour past, present and future generations. And ultimately, we owe it to \nthe brave men and women who sacrifice so much to protect us at home and \nabroad.\n  Each and everyone of us should recognize what a privilege it is to \nlive under the Stars and Stripes. And like Monday, we should do \neverything we can to protect and honor our flag. After all, what it \nrepresents is the very reason our troops are putting their lives on the \nline right now in the war on terror. When you disrespect the flag you \nare disrespecting our men and women in uniform.\n  Mr. President, on the eve our Nation's most important national \nholiday, the Fourth of July, I urge my colleagues to protect our \nNation's great flag.\n  I believe it is our duty as public servants to protect one of our \nNation's greatest symbols of freedom--Old Glory.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today, June 27, 2006, between Flag \nDay and Independence Day, to speak on behalf of the American flag.\n  The American flag is a symbol, a physical embodiment of the freedom \nand liberty that we as Americans are blessed to claim. More than a mere \nbanner of red, white, and blue, our flag characterizes the fundamental \nessence\n\n[[Page S6533]]\n\nof what it means to be an American: liberty, justice and equality.\n  Whether flown at a high school football game, in an Olympic arena, or \nover this very building that we stand in today, the American flag is an \nimage that commands worldwide respect, while at the time symbolizing \nthe triumph of representative Government over the inequities of \ntyrannical rule.\n  To allow for the physical desecration of such a symbol of opportunity \nand liberty is not quite tantamount to condoning an assault on the very \nfoundation of our individual freedoms, but so close as to have damaging \neffects. Strength in symbolism can oftentimes rely upon the extent to \nwhich an image is protected by the society it represents, which is why \nthis is not an issue pertaining to freedom of expression, but rather an \nissue of patriotic reverence and national identity.\n  The American flag has done more than wave as a symbol of freedom; it \nhas served as an inspiration, a guiding light to our men and women in \nuniform throughout our Nation's history.\n  On New Year's Eve, 1776, just 7 months before the signing of our \nDeclaration of Independence, George Washington and the Continental Army \nwere laying siege to the British-occupied Boston. In the midst of \nbattle, Washington recognized the need to present a unifying symbol to \nhis own troops, as well as the need to commemorate the birth of our \ntruly unique sense of American pride. Inspired with the fortitude of \nhis continental troops, Washington ordered the hoisting of the Grand \nUnion flag. This was one of the first instances where our flag became \nmore than a symbol of independence, but the physical representation of \nan ideal stemming from the innate human desire for freedom.\n  On June 14, 1777, almost a year-and-a-half after George Washington \nraised the Grand Union flag over Prospect Hill, the Continental \nCongress passed an act that officially gave America a flag. Though the \nintricacies of the design have changed several times in our nation's \nhistory, the principles that it represents have never faded.\n  Patrick Henry aptly summed up this uniquely American commitment to \npersonal liberty by stating, ``I know not what course others may take \nbut as for me; give me liberty or give me death.'' President Calvin \nCoolidge once commented, ``We do honor to the stars and stripes as the \nemblem of our country and the symbol of all that our patriotism \nmeans.'' Henry and Coolidge spoke of a liberty that was fought for, and \nwon by the sacrifice of thousands of our American sons and daughters. \nAs it stands today, the American flag is a monument to their heroic \neffort, and a testament to the price those serving our country are \nwilling to pay for our freedom.\n  With the 230th birthday of our Nation fast approaching, we will \nundoubtedly see even more American flags on display in front yards, on \ntop of skyscrapers, and in the hands of people celebrating the birth of \nour Nation. While many of these patriotic displays will coincide with \nthe festivities of this national holiday weekend, the unifying message \nbehind every one of these flags is that we as Americans understand the \npower behind our national symbol.\n  It is time that we, as the Nation's legislature, restored the ability \nof the America people to protect the flag as the symbol of our country. \nThis ability has been eroded over the years by judicial decisions that \nhave stripped away the people's right to protect the American flag and \nall that it stands to represent.\n  This sentiment has garnered wide support across the Nation, as is \nevidenced by all 50 states passing resolutions calling upon Congress to \nenact some constitutional protections for the flag. In each of the past \nfive Congresses, the House has passed a constitutional amendment \ndesigned to protect the flag from all forms of desecration, with the \nlatest measure passing almost a year ago by a vote of 286 to 130. Here \nin the Senate, we came up only 4 votes short of the required two-thirds \nmajority in 2000.\n  Today, we stand closer than ever to passing this vital constitutional \nprovision. Some of my colleagues have expressed concerns regarding the \npotential first amendment ramifications of passing this initiative. \nFirst of all, this amendment does not ban anything. It simply restores \nthe authority of Congress, the representatives of the American people, \nto pass a flag desecration statute if it chooses.\n  Second, even if such a statute were subsequently passed, it would not \nplace a restriction on the content of the speech, only on the means by \nwhich the speaker wishes to communicate. Someone seeking to burn the \nflag would still retain their right to express any political viewpoint \nthey wish to advance. They would, however, not have the ability to \ndesecrate the flag as a substitute for other forms of expressive \nconduct.\n  This is why the resolution was reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee with broad support originating from both sides of the aisle. \nThis bipartisan support is evidence that this issue transcends all \npolitical ideology; and to me, this unity could not have come at a more \ncritical moment in history.\n  Internationally, our enemies have consistently used the desecration \nand burning of our flag to symbolize plight of international democracy \nat the hands of Islamist tyranny. Domestically, Americans are daily \nassaulted with media images of home-grown extremists groups burning the \nAmerican flag in an attempt to speak out against the actions of their \nGovernment. The irony, however, is not lost on the American people when \nthey see these political ideologues desecrate the very symbol that \ngives them the right to speak in the first place.\n  This tendency to overshadow our flag's positive symbolism with \nnegative contextual imagery is the reason why the majority of Americans \nsupport this amendment. We understand the power of this national \nsymbol, believe in the principles that our flag represents, and we know \nthat past generations have fought and died to ensure that those \nprinciples resonate well into the future.\n  I ask the Senate to stand in unity with the American people and the \n50 states and ask them to not let this opportunity pass us by without \nacting to protect this still vibrant national symbol.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I believe at this time I am scheduled. \nDoes the Senator from Pennsylvania have control of the time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will take a few minutes.\n  Mr. President, I was completing my luncheon and walking through the \nhallway back to my office when a reporter in a very respectful way \nspoke with me and asked how I intended to vote on this amendment.\n  I said I intended to vote as I have done three previous times; \nbasically to support it, the other options.\n  He said: What is the driving force? Is it your highest priority? And \nhe asked a series of questions in a very polite way which really said: \nStop and think what it is I am about to do and why I am about to do it.\n  I gave him a reply which follows along these lines: I listened to the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania yesterday referring with a deep \nsense of emotional pride about how his family had proudly worn the \nuniform of our country, and most particularly his father who was in the \ngreat Army that went over in 1917-1918 to save Europe, in World War I, \nand how he was severely wounded in the Battle of the Argonne.\n  I checked my own father's record. I, of course, have it proudly on \nthe wall in my Senate office. He served in World War I. He was engaged \nin several major battles. He was a doctor in the trenches and cared for \nthe wounded. He was in the Battle of the Argonne. How do we know \nperhaps my father rendered medical assistance to Senator Specter's \nfather. But those things are instilled in sons and daughters by their \nparents.\n  When it came time for me to proudly raise my right arm and volunteer \nin World War II, I did so because of my father and how proud he was, as \nwas my mother, who, incidentally, was with the American Red Cross in \nWorld War I tending to the wounded in the hospitals in the United \nStates.\n  In my father's library in which I grew up as a small boy, there were \nremnants and artifacts that he brought back from France from the 1917-\n1918 experiences. I remember a small American flag, his helmet, his old \nbelt, and\n\n[[Page S6534]]\n\nseveral other artifacts, and how he and my brother and I treasured them \nas young persons.\n  My military service is of no great consequence. I did have the \nopportunity for a short period in the final year of the war to go \nthrough the training command, but I remember very well I was then just \nin the training part of it--I think, out of boot camp or perhaps in \nboot camp--seeing that flag raised on Iwo Jima. We didn't know at that \ntime in February-March of 1945 how long that war was going to last. We \nhad no idea. We just experienced the Battle of the Bulge in which the \nfinal thrust of the German forces trapped so many of our soldiers with \nunexpected casualties in the 40,000s in that battle and now Iwo Jima, \nsome 17,000 I think killed, wounded, and missing in that battle for \nabout 5 weeks.\n  I remember the picture of that flag going up. Now we see it on the \nmonuments out here which the Marines revere so deeply.\n  That was one of the reasons I later joined the Marine Corps and \nserved for another period on active duty, this time in Korea as a young \nofficer with the Marines. There was no particular valorous service, \njust like many others. You raised your arm and did what you were told \nto do and thanked God you got home in one piece. That is what we were \nall glad to do.\n  So I am very humble about what little active service I had. But I \nhave had the privilege of being associated with the men and women of \nthe Armed Forces for over a half century, now in this Chamber serving \nwith others, again, 28 years on the Senate Armed Services Committee \ndoing everything we can for the men and women of the Armed Forces.\n  So I told this reporter that I felt I had a duty to those who had \nworn the uniform of our country so proudly in these many years that I \nwas privileged to be associated and learn from them and profit from \nthem and my experience in the military.\n  It has been a great, wonderful opportunity for me to have this \nservice in the Senate and have as a part of it the responsibilities. So \nI thought I would recount some statistics.\n  In World War I, the conflict in which our fathers served, I say to \nSenator Specter, 116,000 killed, 204,000 wounded; World War II, 405,000 \nkilled, 671,000 wounded; Korea, 54,000 killed, 103,000 wounded; \nVietnam, 58,000 killed, 153,000 wounded; Desert Storm, that is the \nfirst engagement with Saddam Hussein's forces, 382 killed, 467 wounded; \nAfghanistan, 291 killed, 750 wounded; the second battle with Saddam \nHussein, Iraqi Freedom, 2,521 killed, over 18,000 wounded.\n  Most, if not all, of those brave men, and I expect some women--I \nfully anticipate women were included--came back to their beloved \ncountry from those foreign lands and at some point before they were \nfinally put into Mother Earth an American flag was put on that casket. \nThere is not a one of us in this Chamber who has not had the privilege \nto go to those services. There is not a one of us whose throat hasn't \nswelled or whose eyes haven't welled up when that takes place.\n  So, Mr. President, that flag symbolizes the everlasting--I repeat \neverlasting--gratitude of the citizens of this great Nation for that \ngiving of a life in the cause of freedom. I could do no less than \nproudly stand here and vote ``aye'' for this amendment, as I shall do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise today as well to voice my strong \nsupport for a constitutional amendment that would allow Congress to \nprohibit the desecration of the American flag.\n  Some of the opponents have spoken today about how important it is \nthat we not use this opportunity to amend the Constitution. The Senator \nfrom Illinois referred to the constitutional language, the \nconstitutional sacred language, and question how we could alter what \nThomas Jefferson and our Founding Fathers wrote.\n  I simply point out that in the last 20 years, our colleagues on the \nother side have on over 100 occasions introduced constitutional \namendments. In fact, there was one by the Senator from Illinois a few \nyears back that would abolish the electoral college.\n  So the question isn't whether we amend the Constitution for this \npurpose. It seems to me at least the question that has been raised \nabout the Constitution comes down to one's preference for which \namendments are in order and which are not.\n  I have to say that I think an amendment to protect the American flag \nis in order, not just because it shares a majority and a strong \nbipartisan support in the Senate but because many of the people who \nwere just alluded to by the Senator from Virginia who have fought and \ndied on behalf of that flag want to see this flag honored.\n  Look at the veterans organizations in this country--the American \nLegion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Veterans organizations are very \nmuch in favor of this amendment. In fact, it has been one of their top \npriorities. The American Legion for some time now has been trying to \nget an amendment to the Constitution that would allow Congress to enact \nlaws that would protect the American flag.\n  As a member of the Veterans Affairs Committee, I heard from many \nveterans on this issue who understandably feel strongly about this flag \nand rightly view desecration of the flag as an afront.\n  Many of our veterans have stood in harm's way around the world to \nprotect everything our flag represents. That is why it is a unifying \nsymbol that deserves to be protected from desecration.\n  The proposed amendment is simple. It says:\n\n       The Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical \n     desecration of the flag of the United States.\n\n  It does not amend the first amendment. It simply authorizes Congress \nto pass a law to protect the flag from desecration.\n  This amendment, as I said earlier, has overwhelming bipartisan \nsupport. Members on both sides of the aisle feel strongly that this \nflag should be protected.\n  Our flag is intertwined with some of the most memorable scene's from \nour Nation's history. It was raised at Mt. Suribachi during the battle \nfor Iwo Jima, and draped over the side of the stricken Pentagon on \nSeptember 11. It is what Olympic gold medalists are honored with. It \nbrings comfort to the wife of a fallen soldier. Young schoolchildren \npledge their allegiance to our flag. Above all, it symbolizes the \nfreedoms we hold dear, and I believe it should be protected from \nfalling victim when those freedoms are exploited.\n  Since the birth of our Nation, American soldiers have fought for the \nideals our flag represents and look to it for direction and promise on \nbloody battlefields. The effort we are making here is not something of \nsmall consequence. It is an opportunity to debate an issue of critical \nimportance to the American people and to allow the voice of the people \nto be heard on this critical issue.\n  I am not a lawyer and most Americans are not lawyers, yet the vast \nmajority of Americans know instinctively that the American flag is \nsomething that needs to be protected from desecration. However, right \nnow five unelected lawyers on the Court have decided that desecration \nof the flag deserves the protection of the first amendment. Five \nunelected Justices on the Supreme Court decided that Federal and State \nlaws prohibiting flag desecration were unconstitutional. Many of these \nstatutes had stood for generations before these Justices determined \nthat these statutes were unconstitutional.\n  In fact, four Justices on the Supreme Court completely disagreed with \nthe majority opinion in the flag-burning cases. In fact, Justice \nStevens, perhaps one of the most liberal Justices on the Court, wrote a \ndissenting opinion saying that desecrating the flag is offensive \nconduct, not speech that deserves protection.\n  Our Constitution does not belong to the courts. It belongs to the \npeople. And when the courts get it wrong, it is appropriate the people \nhave an opportunity to correct it. In this case, I believe the opinion \nof the four Justices ought to be the majority opinion, as do the vast \nmajority of the American people. If two-thirds of the Senate, two-\nthirds of the House of Representatives,\n\n[[Page S6535]]\n\nand three-fourths of the State legislatures also believe it should be \nthe majority opinion, then that is a constitutional basis for making it \na majority opinion.\n\n  The notion that flag desecration is a nonexistent problem is also not \nfactual. As Senator Hatch has noted earlier, there have been several \nincidents of flag desecration just in the last year, and these are the \noccasions that were published in the media. They are the ones that we \nknow about.\n  The House of Representatives has passed this amendment with the \nrequired two-thirds majority in each of the past five Congresses, but \nit has always been bottled up here in the Senate. The Senate last voted \non this amendment in the year 2000 when it drew 63 votes. That is a lot \nof votes, but it is still 4 votes short of the 67 that are needed to \npass. This time around, it appears that we are very close to passing \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues who are listening to this debate \nwill ultimately come down in favor of supporting what is a very simple, \nstraightforward approach which simply says that Congress shall have the \npower to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United \nStates. It puts the power in the hands of the Congress--the elected \nrepresentatives of the people of this country--and the people who \nultimately will have the opportunity in the 38 States if this thing is \napproved here today, with the 67 votes that are necessary to vote on \nits passage.\n  So I stand proudly today in support of those veteran organizations \nwho have spoken loudly on this issue--those who have sacrificed and who \nbelieve that the American flag is not just ink and cloth, but is a \nsymbol of our freedom, a symbol of our democracy, and it is something \nthat the majority of Americans and those who have served this country \nand fought to protect it deserve to have protected.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democrats have 35 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. And the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The other side has 9 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished friend from \nIllinois.\n  We are here today, once again, to debate the wisdom of amending the \nUnited States Constitution, to outlaw the desecration of the American \nflag. As I have stated repeatedly and sincerely over the years, there \nare few acts more deeply offensive to any of us than the willful \ndestruction of that American flag which stands there beside the \nPresident's desk.\n  The flag is a symbol of our Republic. It is a unique symbol of \nnational unity and a powerful source of America's pride. I love the \nflag. We all love the flag and all that it represents. We revere the \nflag because it is a symbol of the liberties that we enjoy as American \ncitizens. These are liberties that are protected by the Constitution of \nthe United States and the Bill of Rights. The Constitution is the \ninstrument that provides for what that flag represents.\n  Now, let me say that again. This Constitution that I hold in my hand \nis the instrument--there it is--that provides for what that flag \nrepresents. It is the Constitution that has been and continues to be \nthe source--the source--of our freedom. We celebrate our freedom every \ntime we pledge allegiance to the flag, every day that this Chamber \ncomes to order and conducts a session. So we pledge allegiance to that \nflag and to the Republic--not to the democracy but to the Republic--for \nwhich it stands; one Nation, one Nation under God--yes, under God--\nindivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Think of that. Listen to \nthat. One Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for \nall.\n  Seven years ago, in contemplation of a similar moment when the Senate \nwas confronted with a constitutional amendment banning flag \ndesecration, I spent long hours contemplating both the legal bases and \nthe need for such an amendment. I said at that time, and I say again \ntoday, that I know of few subjects that have come before the Senate \nwhich have caused me greater anguish and consternation. I knew 7 years \nago, and I know today, that many West Virginians, many of my \ncolleagues, many of the people I represent support this amendment. But \nbased on my continued examination of the matter, I believe that I must \nremain--and I shall remain--opposed to that amendment.\n  I oppose it not because I do not love the flag because I do love the \nflag. I oppose it not because I fail to respect the sacrifices made by \nour veterans, our law enforcement officials, and our first responders \nwho, for the benefit of all Americans, have given their lives and who \nhave offered their lives in defense of our country and our flag because \nI do. Instead, I oppose it because while I agree that desecration of \nthe flag is abhorrent, repugnant, I believe that amending the \nConstitution to prohibit flag desecration flies in the face--the very \nface--of first amendment rights like freedom of speech. Men and women \nhave died to protect that freedom of speech, that freedom to express \nourselves.\n  Flag desecration remains a rare and isolated event in this large \ncountry of ours. The vast majority, the overwhelming majority of \nAmericans respect the flag and they fly it with pride. They do not \nabuse it.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee has not held one hearing on this \nproposal. Let me say that again. The Senate Judiciary Committee has not \nheld one hearing on this proposal. It is especially troubling to me \nthat the Senate would seek to amend the Constitution--yes, this \nConstitution that I hold in my hand--and the first amendment--without \nholding even a single hearing on the need for this amendment.\n\n  Now, I know that some who favor this amendment believe that the \nburning of the flag is sufficient to justify the adoption of this \nextraordinary--I say extraordinary--legislative remedy. And I, too, \ncringe, I shrink from, and I condemn any desecration of the flag. But I \ndo not agree that it is necessary to amend the basic document, the \nbasic organic document, the Constitution, to prohibit it.\n  Furthermore, this constitutional amendment provides no actual \npunishment of those who desecrate the flag. Plus, if protection of the \nflag is a pressing concern--and I acknowledge that to many people it \nis--why do the backers of the constitutional amendment not support \npending legislation, of which I am a cosponsor, which could be enacted \nto prohibit desecration of the flag more quickly? As we all know, a \nconstitutional amendment requires ratification by three-fourths--three-\nfourths--of all 50 States, which could take up to 7 years, and it is \nlikely that additional legislation to enforce the enactment would have \nto be enacted after that.\n  I also would not support this constitutional amendment because it \ncontinues to be my heartfelt belief--and I wish I were mistaken--that \nthe primary effect of the amendment will be to create more, rather than \nfewer, incidents of flag desecration, flag destruction. Zealous \ndefenders of the first amendment who are offended, rightly or wrongly, \nby the passage of this amendment will surely cast themselves in a new \nrole; namely, as provocateurs who, newly inspired, will deliberately \nseek to test the boundaries established by this proposed amendment if \nit is adopted.\n  This is more than a matter of symbolism; this is a question of \nrespect, respect for the founding document of the Republic--oh, how \nprecious it is, this founding document, the Constitution of the United \nStates, the supreme law--the supreme law of the land. Any disrespect \nfor the Constitution is a repudiation of the basic principles and laws \nof our country. I do not relish giving a tiny minority of troublemakers \nthe ammunition to denigrate--yes, denigrate not only the flag but also \nthe Constitution of the United States.\n  As I have stated repeatedly, this does not mean that I believe \ndestruction of the flag is trivial or that encouraging reverence for \nthe flag is not an important goal of our government. I simply do not \nbelieve that sporadic instances of flag burning should result in our \nadvocating the course of amending the Constitution, amending the basic \norganic document on which this Republic was built and on which it \nstands, as a remedy. As I have recounted in prior speeches on this \nsubject, the Constitutional Convention in 1787 debated in\n\n[[Page S6536]]\n\nmuch depth whether there should be any--whether there should be any--\nprovision for amending the Constitution. Recognizing, however, that \noccasional revisions might be necessary--and thank God they recognized \nthat occasional revisions might be necessary--the Convention finally \nagreed upon a compromise that deliberately made it difficult to amend \nthe Constitution by requiring successive supermajorities. To that end, \narticle V of the Constitution sets up a cumbersome troublesome, two-\nstep process to amend the Constitution.\n  The first step is approval either by two-thirds of Congress, or--and \nthis has never been done--by a convention called for by two-thirds of \nthe States. The second step is ratification by three-fourths of the \nStates.\n  So given the hurdles that were deliberately and knowingly and \nintentionally established by article V, it is no surprise that so few \namendments to the Constitution have been approved. There are 27 \namendments in all that have been approved, and the first 10 of the 27 \nwere ratified en bloc in 1791. Those 10 constitute our Bill of Rights.\n  Think of it: In the 216 years that have subsequently ensued, there \nhave been just 17 additional amendments. If we disregard the 18th and \nthe 21st amendments, marking the beginning and end of Prohibition, then \nwe are left with only 15 amendments in 216 years. Get that. Only 15 \namendments in 216 years. As I have advised my colleagues before, and as \nthey well know, these 15 amendments can generally be divided into two \nroughly equal categories. One category consists of those amendments \nthat deal with the structure--the structure and the organization of the \nthree branches of Government--the legislative, the executive, and the \njudiciary.\n  These include the 11th amendment, preventing the Federal courts from \nhearing suits against States by citizens of other States; the 12th \namendment, regarding the election of the President and Vice President; \nthe 17th amendment, establishing the direct election of Senators; the \n20th amendment, regulating Presidential terms and related matters; the \n22nd amendment, limiting the President to two terms; the 25th \namendment, regarding Presidential succession; and the 27th amendment, \ndeferring congressional pay raises until after an intervening election.\n  There is little need to justify the inclusion of these provisions in \nthe Constitution; however we may feel about them personally, their \nsubject matter--namely the structure of the Federal Government--fits \nperfec1y within that of Articles I through IV.\n  The second category of constitutional amendments consists of those \nthat narrow the powers of government and expand or protect fundamental \npersonal rights. These include the 13th amendment, banning slavery; the \n14th amendment, which extended citizenship to all persons ``born or \nnaturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction \nthereof'' and guaranteed all citizens certain basic protections; and \nthe 15th, 19th, 23rd, 24th and 26th amendments, each of which extended \nthe vote to new groups of citizens.\n  Clearly, the flag desecration amendment goes in a new direction. For \nconstitutional purposes, as I have said before in these debates, it is \nneither fish nor fowl. It does not address a structural concern; it \ndoes not deal with Federal relations between the national and State \ngovernments; it extends, rather than narrows, the powers of government \nand it is antithetical to the whole thrust of the Constitution; and it \ndoes not protect a basic civil right. Indeed, many opponents of the \namendment argue that it restricts personal liberty, namely the right of \nfreedom of expression.\n  The l3th amendment forbidding slavery may be viewed as the only other \namendment regulating the conduct of individuals. The 13th amendment was \nthe product of a bitter, fiercely contested civil war, and it was \nnecessary to end one of the most loathsome and shameful institutions in \nour Nation's history. This was an exceptional amendment necessitated by \nexceptional circumstances.\n  I have introduced a resolution in support of a constitutional \namendment protecting voluntary prayer in school. This is also an \nexceptional amendment required by exceptional circumstances. Although \nthe Supreme Court has never expressly prohibited children from \nvoluntarily praying in school, children are discouraged from praying in \nschool. School administrators are loathe to address the issue for fear \nthey will be assailed, wrongly, for having broken the law. Confusion \nregarding the legal posture of voluntary prayer in school has created \nan impermissible, exceptional circumstance which, I believe, must be \naddressed in a way that permits school children to pray voluntarily as \nthey deem appropriate. Consequently, I have proposed this year, as I \nhave numerous times over the past 40 years, a constitutional amendment \nthat simply clarifies that the first amendment neither requires nor \nprohibits voluntary prayer in school. This amendment would address the \nexceptional circumstances that afflict thousands of school children, \nnationwide, who mistakenly believe that prayer should not be a part of \ntheir daily lives at school.\n  In the final analysis, it is the Constitution that is the foundation \nand guarantor of the people's liberties, protecting their rights to \nfreedom of speech and to worship as they please. The flag represents \nall of the cherished liberties which we as Americans enjoy--liberties \nexplicitly protected by the text of the U.S. Constitution and the Bill \nof Rights. The flag is a symbol of all that we hold near and dear, and \nof our Nation's history. It is also a symbol of our Constitutional \nvalues. The flag lives only because the Constitution lives. Yet, as I \nhave said in past debates on this issue, the Constitution, unlike the \nflag, is not a symbol; it is the thing itself. I think it might be well \nif, in addition to focusing on efforts to protect the flag against \ninjury, injury which, though reprehensible, does not damage \nConstitutional principles, we make a greater commitment to learning the \nhistorical context of our flag as well as the actual text and meaning \nof the United States Constitution.\n  I do not believe that Americans can participate meaningfully in their \ngovernment if they do not know the legal foundation and principles upon \nwhich it is based. I believe that greater familiarity with the \nprovisions of the Constitution would give all Americans not only an \nenhanced appreciation of the flag as being a symbol of the liberties \nthat are enshrined in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, but also \na literal understanding of our Government's checks and balances, their \npurposes, and of the duties of each of our three branches of Government \nto protect our personal freedoms.\n  Finally, Old Glory lives because the Constitution lives, without \nwhich there would be no American Republic, there would be no American \nliberty, and there would be no American flag. We love that flag. But we \nmust love the guarantees of the Constitution more. For the Constitution \nis not just a symbol; it is, as I say, the thing itself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Prohibition on demonstrations at funerals of members or former \n              members of the Armed Forces.''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Bill of Rights is our Nation's \ngreatest accomplishment. It has been our great fortress against the \npassions and politics of every era. It has been our great beacon to the \nrest of the world, demonstrating that we value our liberty more deeply \nthan power or riches. And it is fitting that such a document, which \ndescribes the rights inherent to a free people, has not been amended--\nnot once--in its entire 217 years.\n  The Founders knew that the first amendment of the Bill of Rights \nwould allow all manner of speech, including some speech that was \ncontemptible. They were no strangers to fiery rhetoric. Most of them \nbegan their public lives not only by making speeches but by engaging in \nother expressive conduct, such as hanging King George's tax collectors \nin effigy and dumping tea into Boston Harbor. The breadth of the first \namendment is not an accident; it is an essential part of the Founders' \ndesign.\n  For the 217 years that followed the adoption of the Bill of Rights, \nwe have managed to preserve every word. Every generation of leaders--\nuntil today--considered the Bill of Rights to be sacred and recognized \nthat they could not claim to be protecting our freedoms by curtailing \nthem. And the past 217 years have proved that we can survive civil wars \nand world wars, fascism, communism, economic collapse and all manner of \ncivil strife--all without diluting the Bill of Rights.\n  So why are we addressing flag burning? I completely agree that flag \nburning is a contemptible and malicious act, calculated to outrage \nrather than persuade. But flag burning occurs infrequently and can \nusually be punished\n\n[[Page S6538]]\n\nunder existing laws. We are being asked to undermine the foundation of \nour democracy in order to squash a gnat.\n  We might be forgiven for focusing on this small problem if we were \nnot inundated with great ones.\n  If the Senate wants to improve our Nation, why don't we turn today to \nlegislation that would reduce the vast numbers of children who go to \nbed hungry each night?\n  If the Senate wants to prevent despicable behavior, why don't we hold \ncomprehensive hearings on the billions of tax dollars that have been \nstolen and squandered by companies hired to rebuild Iraq?\n  If the Senate wants to keep faith with our veterans, why don't we \nleave the Constitution alone and work to improve our VA hospitals?\n  The inescapable answer is that our Republican leaders' priorities are \nbeing driven by election year politics. But this is even more than a \ncase of misplaced priorities. It is playing politics with our most \nfundamental freedom. Doing so opens up a Pandora's box, and if our \ncherished Bill of Rights is further diluted by future generations, that \nloss of liberty will trace its heritage to this Senate.\n  Let me end with the words of our national anthem, the ``Star Spangled \nBanner''. As every schoolchild knows, the first stanza ends with these \nwords:\n\n     O say does that star spangled banner yet wave\n     O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?\n\n  This amendment may protect our star spangled banner, but that flag \nwill wave over a land that is a little less free and a little less \nbrave. I urge this Senate to find the courage to leave the Bill of \nRights intact.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that we extend the time for \ndebate 5 minutes on each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the Senator from \nNew York for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am proud to stand here today and speak \nout for protecting the American flag and the Constitution, of which our \nflag is a revered and honored symbol. Whenever I see the flag of our \ncountry, I am reminded of how fortunate I am to have been born an \nAmerican, born into a country that, at her best, nurtures our strengths \nand gives each of us the freedom to express our ideas, display our \ntalents, and become the best we can be, to live up to our God-given \npotential.\n  That is what the flag means to me. It represents the best of us--our \nideals, our sense of duty and sacrifice: the American spirit. Those \nvalues transcend party, ethnicity, age, race, gender. Indeed, those \nvalues transcend even nationality. Around the world, our flag is a \nsymbol of hope and freedom.\n  I understand the outrage that is expressed today by my colleagues, \nand I agree wholeheartedly that maliciously burning or destroying an \nAmerican flag is a deeply offensive and despicable act. It disrespects \nour Nation. It belittles the sacrifices of our brave veterans. It even \nsends a message to the soldiers who fight today protecting our freedom \nthat their service is in some way to be disrespected and discounted.\n  I have met with many veterans over the last many years, and I have \nheard the sense of betrayal that comes from those who risked their \nlives under that flag to protect our freedoms. That is why I support \nFederal legislation like the Durbin-Bennett amendment. When we think of \nall the flag symbolizes, I urge that we consider the very freedom and \nliberty the flag embodies. It is, in effect, a visual symbol of our \nConstitution and particularly our Bill of Rights. Our Founding Fathers \nwere keenly aware that if the Constitution was to remain the \ncornerstone of our Government and laws, then changing it should be \ndifficult. That is the system they set up.\n  The infrequency of amendments in our long history is telling. \nConstitutional amendments have historically met two sets of objectives. \nThe first deals with the structure of our Government and the \nrelationship between the executive, legislative, and judiciary \nbranches--our system of checks and balances. The second protects \nfundamental rights, including the 13th amendment that bans slavery and \nthe 15th, 19th, 23rd, 24th, and 26th amendments, all of which expanded \nthe right to vote.\n  The amendment we debate today meets neither of these compelling \nobjectives. The Constitution to which we all have sworn an oath is \nabout protecting our rights. I believe we do that by honoring the \nConstitution, which has never been amended to deny or limit the Bill of \nRights. I don't think we should start doing that today.\n  Fortunately, we have an opportunity to protect our flag in a \nbipartisan and constitutional way. Senator Durbin's amendment, the Flag \nProtection Act of 2006, which I am cosponsoring, would among other \nthings prohibit people from destroying a flag with the intent of \ninciting imminent violence, threatening someone by burning a flag, \ndamaging a flag owned by the United States and damaging a flag that \nbelongs to another while on Federal land.\n  I believe, as do many legal scholars, this legislation will stand up \nto constitutional scrutiny. It is different from previous bills that \nhave been voted on in this Chamber before.\n  It adds a new provision that follows Supreme Court precedent, from \nthe case Virginia v. Black decided in 2003. In that case, the Supreme \nCourt held that the Government may prohibit people from burning crosses \nwith the intent to intimidate. That should be a pretty straightforward \nproposition, but it was called into question. So the case made its way \nto the Supreme Court. The Court concluded that laws may, in fact, ban \ncross burnings meant to intimidate ``because burning a cross is a \nparticularly virulent form of intimidation.''\n  Burning a flag, to me, is also despicable, and I believe that there \nis no denying that when we talk about our flag, Americans' emotions run \ndeep. We know when we look at a flag that is deliberately, maliciously \ndestroyed, that is an intimidating experience in many instances.\n  I agree that this burning, this desecration that can happen to our \nflag, is something that people have a right to ask this body to try to \nprohibit and prevent.\n  I hope we can pass a law that criminalizes flag burning and \ndesecration that is constitutional and can survive Supreme Court \nscrutiny.\n  I appreciate all the New Yorkers, especially the veterans whom I \nrepresent, many of whom have come to see me here and in my State. They \nexpressed feelings both pro and con. I assure them that I will join \nwith my colleagues to stand up for their needs and to stand up for the \nneeds of those young men and women wearing the uniform today.\n  For those reasons, I am a proud cosponsor of Senator Durbin's \namendment, and I hope that we can come together and pass a \nconstitutional law that protects our flag and reaffirms our commitment \nto our Nation's Constitution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, it is an honor and a privilege to stand \nwith my fellow cosponsors in support of S.J. Res. 12, an amendment \ndesigned not merely to protect the physical integrity of the American \nflag but the very heart of our democratic republic. From 1776 to today, \nfrom the Marines who fought their way to plant the flag at the top of \nIwo Jima to the firefighters who lifted the flag above the ruins of the \nWorld Trade Center, it is clear that ``Old Glory'' represents so much \nmore than a nation. In truth, the American flag represents thousands of \nyears of struggle in human history to achieve political liberty, \nreligious autonomy, and freedom from want. More important, our flag \nrepresents the inspiration of the life of our Nation and what humanity \nhas the potential to accomplish.\n  Throughout our Nation's history, the American flag has enjoyed the \nprotection not only of its people but its laws.\n\n[[Page S6539]]\n\nUnfortunately, this safeguard was eroded in 1989 by the Supreme Court \ndecision in Texas vs. Johnson. This decision, which many of my \ncolleagues and I agree was misguided, found within the Constitution a \nright that had never before existed: the right to physically assault \nthe flag under the First Amendment. Since then, Members of Congress \nhave been faced with reconciling the tension between ``free speech'' \nand the symbolic importance of the American flag. Many have argued that \nthis tension exists between matters of fact and matters of the heart. \nBut in my view, protecting our flag is a matter of both.\n  Whether we choose to acknowledge them or not, acts of violence or \ndesecration towards our flag have become a grave reality in our \ncountry. Since the Texas decision in 1989, there have been more than \n120 reported cases of flag degradation across the United States, and \nthis number reflects only those events that were publicized by the \nmedia. Even with that reality in mind, we must remember that the point \nis not how often the flag has been burned, defaced, trampled, or torn \nor even those responsible for such heinous acts. Rather, the point has \nto do with our response--especially our official response--to \nthose events. As citizens, we can no longer allow flag burning to be \nconsidered a ``norm'' in our society. Although we can do nothing when \nterrorists or those with anti-American sentiments defile our flag \nabroad, we owe it to our brave service men and women, to ourselves, and \nto our children to do something when it happens on our own soil.\n\n  Prior to the Texas decision, 48 out of our 50 States had statutes \nprohibiting flag desecration on the books. And since 1989, support for \nprotecting our flag has only increased. Today, as the distinguished \nMajority Leader, Senator Frist, has said, an overwhelming 80 percent of \nthe American public and all 50 State legislatures agree that the \nConstitution should allow States and the Federal Government to protect \nthe flag. This is exactly what this resolution was designed to do. The \namendment does not prohibit flag desecration itself, but will give \nCongress and democratically elected State legislatures the opportunity \nto deliberate and ultimately decide how they will guard the United \nStates flag.\n  It is important to note that the amendment process is not something \nthat we as citizens or Congressmen should take lightly. However, when \nwe look back in history, it is clear that constitutional amendments \nhave only taken effect when both citizens and legislators have joined \ntogether to demand change, after prolonged periods of social unrest. As \nwe look forward to our Nation's birthday next week, it is clear that \nnow is the time to put an end to this political dissension and embrace \nthe freedom and the responsibility we inherited from our forefathers. \nThe amendment process is a fundamental provision of the Constitution, \nand by making use of it, we not only reaffirm its foundation, but we \nreveal the virtue embedded in democracy.\n  Ultimately, we must remember that democracy, from 2500 years ago when \noriginally articulated by philosophers like Aristotle, to more modern \ndiscussions about democratic nation-building in the Middle East, has \nalways encompassed much more than a structural or institutional \nframework for government. Although elements such as free elections, \ndispersed power, basic human freedoms, equality, and an involved \ncitizenry are important in thinking about democratic governments, the \nidea itself revolves around a vision. That vision acknowledges human \nbeings are capable of securing their liberty but also establishing a \nfree, prosperous, and ultimately, unified society. It is a vision that \nhas inspired people everywhere, but especially Americans, with hope, \noptimism, and an unwavering sense of loyalty. Such a vision is best \nexpressed in the waving stars and stripes of Old Glory.\n  We often warn our children ``If you can't stand for something, you'll \nfall for anything.'' Today, it is my hope that we will come together \nand agree that there is nothing we would rather stand up for than the \nAmerican flag.\n  Let me speak specifically to a provision--the Durbin amendment--that \nshould be troubling to all of us.\n  Just this past month, this body voted unanimously to support, and the \nPresident has just signed, an act called the Respect for America's \nFallen Heroes Act.\n  The legislation that was authorized and moved out of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee speaks to those who choose to demonstrate during \nperiods in the ceremony at a cemetery in the burial of one of our \nfallen heroes.\n  This body rightfully protected those families and those mourners in \ncertain demonstrations at the VA's 223 national cemeteries and at \nArlington National Cemetery. We differed a little with the House, and \nthe reason we differed with the House is quite clear. There were two \nconstitutional reasons for differing with the House.\n  The first amendment right to assemble peacefully was one of those, \nand the second one was a federalism principle that I think the Senator \nfrom Illinois walks all over--that recognizes we only have the right to \nshape those activities on Federal property.\n  The Durbin amendment fails miserably to adhere to the federalism \nprinciples--the very principle that drove my amendment to the House-\npassed version of the Fallen Heroes Act. Therefore, I am here today to \nurge my colleagues to oppose the Durbin amendment on two grounds.\n  First of all, the courts have said we can't legislate as it relates \nto flag burning; secondly, we ought not be telling States what to do as \nit relates to private cemeteries or State cemeteries. I think that is \nvery clear.\n  I said at the time we voted on the Fallen Heroes Act that I would ask \nthat federalism be protected.\n  I must say in conclusion that there is no commerce nexus in what the \nSenator from Illinois is attempting to do. This clearly is a federalism \nargument. It is a State and local responsibility to protect that which \nthe Senator from Illinois is asking us to protect.\n  We have already acted in defense of our fallen heroes on Federal \nproperty, as we should rightfully have done.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, we are in the midst of a debate that, \nfrankly, I think we ought to have, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of \nthis resolution. I share the view of the majority of Georgians that the \nAmerican flag symbolizes the strong values that our country stands \nfor--freedom, liberty and representative democracy. And most \nimportantly, our American flag represents the generations of men and \nwomen who have fought and died defending those values. I have the \nprivilege of representing a proud military state, and nothing makes me \nmore proud when traveling around Georgia than to stand with the folks I \nrepresent, face our flag--place my hand over my heart--and recite the \nPledge of Allegiance.\n  The flag represents our way of life. It hangs in our classrooms, over \nour police stations, fire stations, and courthouses. It flies above \nthis historic Capitol. It was borne by troops in battle to protect our \nliberties and has covered the caskets of fallen soldiers, airmen, and \nmarines who made the ultimate sacrifice for us. It is an emotional \nsymbol to so many of us.\n  I have had the opportunity to travel around the world to represent my \nstate and my country--and the one symbol that everybody in and \nparticularly outside of America looks to when they think about America \nis that great flag that we have lived under for all these many years. \nAnd for anybody to think that they ought to be able to stomp on that \nflag, or trample that flag or burn that flag or destroy that flag in \nany way other than a professional way is simply wrong.\n  There are those who say we ought not ``change'' the Constitution. \nYet, for 200 years the legislative branch of our governmental had the \npower under our Constitution to prohibit the desecration of the flag. \nOnly in 1989 and 1990 did a divided Supreme Court, for the first time \nin our history, ``change'' the Constitution to say that Congress no \nlonger had that power. I believe the amendment process, provided for by \nthe Constitution itself, is the lawful means by which the American \npeople may restore common sense when the Supreme Court abandons it.\n  Let me take a moment to say that I understand that a substitute has \nbeen\n\n[[Page S6540]]\n\nfiled and that the substitute has in it language to prohibit protests \nat military funerals. The language is basically the same language as \nthe bill that Senator Bayh and I introduced months ago.\n  I hope we can work together to get this bill passed as a stand-alone \nbill. We need to ensure that families can bury their servicemembers in \nthe peace and dignity and respect they have earned.\n  I ask that a vote be made against the substitute and for the \nunderlying resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I stand here proud of my country, \nproud of our liberties, proud of our flag. I went to Europe as a young \nman during World War II--the first time I was out of the country--and \nput on a uniform to defend the honor and freedoms that this country \nrepresents.\n  Now we talk about flag desecration by the actions of a few who dare \nburn our flag. It is a repulsive, ugly act. We never want to see it. \nBut do we take away their right to dissent and do we say America is a \ncountry that can't stand dissent? No. One's patriotism may be another \nperson's desecration.\n  Here's a picture--I show this poster not at all to denigrate the \nPresident of the United States, but that is the hand of the President \nof the United States using a magic marker to write on this flag. He \nnever intended to be disrespectful; he loves this country. I differ \nwith him on policy, but is that desecration, I ask you?\n  I think this second poster is another example that represents \ndesecration. Here he is, Kid Rock, with his head through the flag. Is \nthat a desecration? It was such a desecration that he was invited to \nperform in a concert at the Republican Convention, and they partied \nwith him. They loved him.\n  What constitutes desecration? A lapel pin? We worry about what we do \nfor our soldiers and say that we love the flag so much, but we won't \nallow news photos of flag-draped coffins coming into Dover? Pictures of \nthose flags are banned?\n  What is going on here? This is politicking at its worst. We should \nnot violate the freedoms guaranteed by our Constitution and the Bill of \nRights. It is raw politics. It doesn't demonstrate patriotism. I invite \neverybody to have the courage to vote against this amendment and show \ntheir courage and not to be intimidated by wondering what this one will \nthink or wondering what that one will think.\n  We are invited here to think about the freedoms that our country \noffers and our responsibility, and it is not only protecting the flag, \nit is protecting our liberties. It is making sure that we protect our \nveterans, that we give them the right kind of equipment, and that we \ngive them the resources they need. That, to me, is the kind of \npatriotism that ought to be rewarded--not to say if you write in ink or \nyou tear the flag that we are going to amend the Constitution to get at \nyou. A half dozen or a dozen people have done that to offend everybody. \nThat should not let us be stampeded into amending our Constitution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, whether it would ever be a crime to write \non the flag or wear it at a concert, who knows? This whole debate is \nabout restoring the power of elected officials to be able to manage \nsuch events. The Supreme Court, in a 5-to-4 decision, took the power \naway from everyone who is elected to have any say about the flag. This \nhappened in 1989.\n  We have lived here free, open, safe, and secure of being able to \nregulate conduct toward disrespecting the flag for most of our life. \nOnly since 1989 and a 5-to-4 decision have we had this problem.\n  I stand here wanting every elected official to have the \nconstitutional power that we previously possessed before the 5-to-4 \ndecision. And we will decide among ourselves what a good statute might \nbe or may not be. Everybody can go through that process and be \nanswerable to the people.\n  I do not believe it is a burden to place on our citizens at large not \nto disrespect the flag. It is a burden we can bear as a people. If you \ndo not like me, there are a million ways you can show your displeasure \nwith my time in the Senate. But the fact is, I am an elected \nrepresentative. All I am asking citizens as a whole is that we have one \nthing in common--that we are able to talk with each other and debate \nissues without destroying the flag.\n  To me, that is a burden that we can bear. Freedom without \nresponsibility is chaos. So it doesn't bother me one bit to turn to my \nworst enemy and say: This one thing is out of bounds. Have your say, \nhave your fun, do what you are going to do, speak as loudly as you want \nto speak, but this is one thing I ask of you: please don't destroy the \nflag.\n  To the few citizens who feel a need to do that, it doesn't bother me \none bit for them to be told no. That is what is wrong with our country \ntoday. Nobody is afraid to tell anybody else no. I am not afraid at \nall; to the few who want to destroy the flag, I am gladly willing to \ntell you no. That doesn't make me any less free or you any less free.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the ranking member, \nthe distinguished Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  As we close this debate and move on to a vote on this proposal, I \ncommend to all Senators the words of the senior Senator from Hawaii, a \nwar hero and veteran, a patriot, an American of the first order. He was \nlong denied the Congressional Medal of Honor that he earned long ago \nand paid for dearly. He knows why he fought and sacrificed. No one on \nthis floor has fought harder for this country, for its flag, for our \nfreedoms or for our veterans and their families. He has shown \ncharacteristic leadership and courage in his statement today against \ndoing damage to our Constitution through this proposed amendment. I am \nhonored to stand with him in this fight to preserve our Bill of Rights. \nI commend the other veterans, as well, Senators Lautenberg and Kerry. I \nthank the Senators from West Virginia and Massachusetts for their \nstatements and the Senator from New York.\n  The action by the Republican leadership on this amendment reminds me \nof the action they forced in connection with the Terri Schiavo case. \nThen the President hurried back from a vacation with great fanfare to \nsign a bill rushed through the Republican-led Congress to intrude into \na family and personal tragedy. The politicians overreached and the \nAmerican people saw through it. Here, too, this election-year exercise \nwill be seen for what it is.\n  This is the second constitutional amendment that the Senate has \nconsidered this month in the Republican runup to the November election. \nOf course, among the amendments the Republican majority has chosen not \nto consider is the one promised by the 2000 Republican Party Platform, \nto require a balanced budget. Even Republican partisans must be \nembarrassed at the deficits that the Bush-Cheney administration and the \nRepublican Congress have generated as they turned an historic budget \nsurplus into an historic deficit.\n  This proposed amendment regarding flag desecration is another in a \nseries of amendments Republicans have pressed that would result in \nrestricting the rights of the American people. It is one of more than \n65 constitutional amendments introduced so far in this Congress alone, \nand more than 11,000 since the First Congress convened in 1789. Can you \nimagine what the Constitution would look like if even a small fraction \nof these amendments had been adopted? The Constitution that we now \nrevere as fundamental law, that provides us with unity and stability in \ntimes of trouble, would be like the old French Constitution--filed \nunder ``p'' for ``periodicals.'' We honor our Senate oath when we \n``support and defend'' the Constitution. That is what I will be doing \nby voting today to uphold the Constitution and by voting against \namending it.\n  I am encouraged by the Senate's bipartisan rejection of action on \nS.J.\n\n[[Page S6541]]\n\nRes.1, the proposal to federalize marriage by way of a constitutional \namendment. Forty-eight Senators voted against cloture, and I believe \nthat others who voted in favor of more debate were nonetheless troubled \nby the proposal. The failure of the Republican leadership to obtain \neven a simple majority of Senators to support their efforts, on a \nprocedural vote, should indicate to them how unwise it is to abuse the \nConstitution in a partisan election-year tactic.\n  Like the marriage amendment, the flag amendment would artificially \ncreate division among the American people. The timing of this \nconsideration, 4 months before the mid-term election, raises concerns, \nagain, that the Constitution is being misused for partisan purposes. \nThat is wrong.\n  We act here in the Senate as stewards of the Constitution, guardians \nand trustees of a precious legacy. The truly precious part of that \nlegacy does not lie in outward things--in monuments or statues or \nflags. All that these tangible things can do is remind us of what is \ntruly precious: our liberty.\n  This proposed amendment would be the first amendment to the \nConstitution that would narrow the precious freedoms enjoyed by \nAmericans under the Bill of Rights. The infringement would fall on the \nfirst amendment, the cornerstone and foundation of all of our rights, \nof which we must be especially protective. The first amendment has \nstood up in times of war, during times of bitter protest. It has been \none of the rocks on which our national unity and our national stability \nare built.\n  The proposed amendment is a wrong-headed response to a crisis that \ndoes not exist. It would be an unprecedented limitation on the freedom \nAmericans enjoy under the Bill of Rights and would do nothing to \nbolster respect for the flag. Respect for the flag flows from the \nfreedoms we enjoy and from the sacrifices of those who have protected \nthat freedom. Our cherished flag is the symbol of our Nation and of the \nConstitution that is the foundational keystone of our Republic, and of \nour freedom. This is about defending the Constitution, my friends, for \nwhich our flag stands. Each generation of Americans owes the next \ngenerations the effort and the dedication it takes to pass along the \ntorch of freedom, undiminished. We owe it to them, and to those who \nhave sacrificed so much for us, to cherish and to protect freedom, and \nthe Constitution which is the written promise of that freedom.\n  Rather than face the solemn responsibility of justifying an amendment \nto the Constitution, proponents of S.J. Res 12 have urged that we just \npass it on to the States and let them decide. They said that Senators \nshould abdicate their responsibility to exercise their best judgment \nand simply pass the buck. I could hardly believe my ears.\n  Have we utterly forgotten the words of James Madison and the \nconservative conception of amendment the Founders built into our \nConstitution? The Constitution intentionally makes it difficult to pass \namendments to our fundamental law. No amendment can pass unless every \nlevel of government, from the House to the Senate to the States, \noverwhelmingly supports it. Our system is undermined if each \ninstitution of government does not exercise independent judgment, if we \ndo not fulfill our constitutional responsibility.\n  This is the fifth time that this body has considered a constitutional \namendment to punish flag burners. Some of us have voted on the proposal \nbefore; others have not. But either way, we are undertaking the gravest \nof responsibilities. We are taking in our hands the inalienable rights \nof Americans, today and the generations that follow long after we have \ngone. We are handling the most precious heirloom that we have, the \nfinest thing that we can hope to pass on to our children and \ngrandchildren. I would hope that at this of all times we would give the \nConstitution the respect that it deserves and support and defend it.\n  This week we returned to use what little time left to the Senate this \nyear to revisit a debate on that has wisely been rejected in this \nchamber four times in the last 17 years: a proposed amendment that \nwould roll back our first amendment freedoms for the first time in our \nNation's history. While we devote precious floor time to debate this \nmatter, the Nation is gripped by the ongoing war in Iraq, the \ncontinuing threat of terrorism, soaring energy and health care prices, \nrising inflation, and a burgeoning deficit.\n  Indeed, this debate is another illustration of the Republican \nleadership's disregard for the needs of the American people and the \ninstitutional responsibilities of this body. They continue to mistreat \nour Constitution as if it were a bulletin board on which to hang \npolitical posters or bumper stickers. The Constitution is too important \nto be used for partisan political purposes, and so is the American \nflag.\n  The timing of this debate raises the question of why the Republican \nleadership has made this issue its top priority in the face of an \nunfinished agenda of legislative matters that do concern Americans day \nin and day out. The Senate has hardly made progress on a legislative \nagenda. We have yet to consider any of the 13 appropriations bills for \nthe year. We have yet to enact a budget resolution, which was required \nby law to be in place on April 15. We have yet to enact a lobbying \nreform bill, a comprehensive immigration bill, or pension protection \nlegislation. We have yet to consider or pass asbestos litigation reform \nlegislation, patent reform legislation or the reauthorization of the \nVoting Rights Act. We have yet to pass a long overdue raise in minimum \nwage, to take action to lower gas prices, health care costs or health \ninsurance costs. Instead, with less than 10 weeks left in this session \nof Congress, the Republican leadership will work on none of those \nimportant matters.\n  The amendment we consider today would artificially create division \namong the American people, and the timing of this debate--squarely in \nthe middle of an election year--demonstrates, again, that the \nConstitution is being misused for partisan purposes. The Constitution \ndeserves our respect, vigilant protection and in the words of our \nSenate oath our ``support''. We have a duty to defend it. The \nConstitution is not a blog for venting political opinions, curry \nfavoring with voters or trying to bump up sagging poll numbers.\n  The flag is an important symbol of all that makes America great. But \nthe cynical use of symbolic politics in an election year will not \naddress the very real needs of veterans and other Americans that are \nbeing left unmet by this administration and the Republican Congress.\n  I know that many veterans support the flag desecration amendment and \nI respect their views. We must not forget though that there also are \nmany veterans who oppose it. I appeared with a number of distinguished \nveterans on Flag Day who spoke about their dedication to the principles \nthat make this country great and for which they fought and sacrificed. \nThose principles include our precious freedoms under the first \namendment. These veterans of World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the First \nGulf War and Iraq made clear that they fought for what the flag stands \nfor, not just the symbol itself.\n  Former Senator John Glenn, a combat veteran, wrote: ``The flag is the \nNation's most powerful and emotional symbol. It is our most sacred \nsymbol. And it is our most revered symbol. But it is a symbol. It \nsymbolizes the freedoms that we have in this country, but it is not the \nfreedoms themselves.''\n  The late John Chafee, a distinguished member of this body and a \nhighly decorated veteran of World War II and Korea, opposed this \namendment because, he said: ``We cannot mandate respect and pride in \nthe flag. In fact taking steps to require citizens to respect the flag, \nsullies its symbolism and significance.''\n  Flag desecration is a despicable and reprehensible act. We agree with \nthat--all of us agree that it is contemptible. That is not the issue, \ninstead, the issue before us is whether we should amend the \nConstitution of the United States with all the risks that that entails \nand whether, for the first time in our history, we should narrow the \nprecious freedoms ensured by the first amendment. Should we amend the \nfirst amendment so that the government can prosecute the handful of \nindividuals who show contempt for the flag, those General Powell called \nmiscreants? Such a monumental step is unwarranted and unwise.\n  We are being tested. This generation of Americans is being tested by \nthe\n\n[[Page S6542]]\n\nthreat of international terrorism. America wins when it meets that \nchallenge without allowing those who threaten us to compromise us. We \nsuffer losses not only when we suffer attacks as we did toward the end \nof President Bush's first year in office, but also when we give up \nthose freedoms that define us as Americans. For the Congress to \nsurrender our fundamental rights as Americans as proposed in the \nconstitutional amendment is wrong.\n  Following the very real attacks on 9/11, Americans embraced the flag \nlike never before, proudly displaying flags and flag symbols as a sign \nof unity and strength in the wake of those horrible acts against our \nnation. People around the world grieved for us, cared for us, and \njoined with us to fight terrorism. Over time, missteps and arrogance by \nthe Bush-Cheney administration have alienated much of the world. Still, \nAmericans of all political persuasions have not needed a law to tell \nthem how precious our freedoms are or how to honor the Stars and \nStripes.\n  Supporters of this constitutional amendment seem to believe that \nAmericans need rules about respecting the flag punishable by law. I \nstrongly disagree and the American people have already proven them \nwrong. The American people do not need a lesson in cherishing and \nhonoring our flag and the Republic for which it stands. That may be \nnecessary in Saddam Hussein's Iraq or in Stalin's Soviet Union or in \nCastro's Cuba, but not in America.\n  In fact, respect cannot be coerced or compelled. It can only be given \nvoluntarily. We respect and love our country, but not because we are \ntold to. Americans do not love our country because we would be punished \nif we did not. Some may find it more comfortable to silence dissenting \nvoices, but coerced silence creates resentment, disrespect, and \ndisunity. I proudly fly the flag at my farm in Vermont because, as an \nAmerican, it is what I choose to do.\n  In every hamlet and city and on every rural route in America, you can \nsee our flag being flown with pride. Americans in overwhelming numbers \nare honoring our flag, not defacing it.\n  Of course, there are times when individuals deface the flag or \nviolate the rules for its care. For example, President Bush was \ncaptured on film signing a hand-held flag at a campaign rally in the \nsummer of 2004. Appropriate or not, these acts are protected by our \nConstitution. They do not need to be punished by Congress after we pass \na constitutional amendment restricting the first amendment rights of \nall Americans.\n  In all of the hearings, all of the debate that we have devoted to \nthis topic over the past 17 years, not one single person has testified \nthat he respects the flag less because a protestor burned it, wrote on \nit, sewed it in the seat of his pants, or otherwise misused it. Not \none.\n  Not one single person has testified that they love our country less \nbecause Americans are free to express themselves in this way. Not one. \nThere is not a single indication that any act of flag burning has \nlessened the respect that any American has for the flag or for our \ncountry. It would be pathetic if our love of country or respect for its \nfundamental principles was so weak that it could be diminished by such \nan act. We know that it is not.\n  The truth is just the opposite. Occasional insults to the flag do \nnothing to diminish our respect for it. Rather, they remind us of our \nlove for the flag, for our country, and for our freedom to speak, think \nand worship as we please.\n  Our flag is a cherished symbol. As are the freedoms for which it \nstands, including the freedom to express unpopular speech or ideas--\neven extremely unpopular ideas.\n  As I have said many times throughout this debate, I wish the Senate \nwould, instead, use its time to discuss and solve the real problems \nthat real Americans are facing right now, instead of trying to stir \npublic passions for political ends.\n  I respectfully suggest that in the less than 10 weeks left to us in \nsession this year, the Senate's resources would be better spent working \nto improve veterans' health care services, survivors' benefits and \nprotecting veterans' and Americans' privacy. There are so many issues \nthat we could turn to that would help improve the lives of our veterans \nand their families. Why not focus on them?\n  Just today on the front page of the newspaper, we learned that this \nGovernment's bureaucratic bungling has resulted in widows of those who \nhave served this Nation and sacrificed for all of us are being denied \nthe survivors' benefits to which they should be entitled. This news \nfollows closely public reports that post-traumatic stress disorders \namong our veterans are on the rise.\n  Instead of seeking to turn the flag into a partisan political weapon \nand the Constitution into a billboard for political slogans, for \npartisan gain, we could be spending time debating these real issues or \nmuch-needed funding for services to our veterans. This President's \nbudget requests have consistently fallen short of the levels needed to \nprovide necessary services and care. President Bush's budgets force our \nveterans to subsidize their government health care and simply does not \naccount for the increase in demand for VA services due to the Iraq war.\n  We could also be taking real action to prevent the kind of data \nlosses that just affected millions of our veterans. We just witnessed \nthe largest theft of private information from the Government ever, the \nloss of information on more than 26.5 million American veterans, \nincluding more than 2 million who are in active service, nearly 80 \npercent of our active-duty force and a large percentage of our National \nGuard and the Reserve.\n  Last year, Senator Specter and I introduced the Personal Data Privacy \nand Security Act, which requires Federal agencies and private data \nbrokers to give prompt notice when sensitive personal information has \nbeen breached or stolen. The Judiciary Committee overwhelmingly \napproved this bill last fall, but almost a year later, the Senate has \nstill not acted on this legislation. Had this bill been enacted, it \nwould have required the VA to promptly notify the millions of veterans \nnow at risk of identity theft about the theft of their personal data. \nOur bill also addresses the Government's use of personal data by \nputting privacy and security front and center in evaluating whether \ndata brokers can be trusted with Government contracts that involve \nsensitive information about the American people.\n  The Nation's veterans--who have been willing to make the ultimate \nsacrifice for their country--deserve to have the best tools available \nto protect themselves and their families from identity theft. The \nSenate should be acting to consider and pass comprehensive data privacy \nand security legislation.\n  Sadly, the list of what we are not accomplishing goes on and on. The \nway things are going, under Republican leadership, this session will \nmake the ``do nothing'' Congress against which President Harry Truman \nran seem like a legislative juggernaut.\n  The days we have spent on this amendment could be spent more \nproductively on any of the matters I have mentioned. There are less \nthan 10 weeks remaining in the Senate's scheduled work year. It seems \nthat even with all that remains undone, at this point in this election \nyear, floor time is available only for matters that advance the \nRepublicans narrow political agenda.\n  Republicans have the Senate majority; they control the schedule, they \nset the priorities. In my view, it reflects a strange set of priorities \nto think our national interest is best served at this time by debating \na constitutional amendment to roll back the Bill of Rights for the \nfirst time in our history.\n  I treat proposals to amend the Constitution with utmost seriousness, \nfor it is a serious responsibility. I began this debate by noting my \nhome State of Vermont's tradition of independence and commitment to the \nBill of Rights. Vermont did not and would not become a State until \n1791, the year the Bill of Rights was ratified. At one time, we \ndeclared ourselves an independent republic.\n  I plan to proudly uphold that tradition today by voting against this \namendment, and I hope, although likely in vain, that the Senate will \nmove on to more pressing matters that directly affect the lives and \nlivelihoods of the American people.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       June 8, 2006.--Now that the Republican leaders in the \n     Senate have finished wasting\n\n[[Page S6543]]\n\n     the nation's time over a constitutional ban on gay marriage, \n     we're bracing for Act Two of the culture-war circus that the \n     White House is staging to get out the right-wing vote this \n     fall.\n       Senator Bill Frist, the majority leader, plans to continue \n     to set aside work on pressing issues facing the country to \n     vote on yet another unworthy constitutional amendment--a \n     prohibition on burning the American flag.\n       If the gay marriage amendment was a pathetic attempt to \n     change the subject in an election year, the flag-burning \n     proposal is simply ridiculous. At least there actually is a \n     national debate about marriage, and many thousands of gay \n     couples want to wed. Flag burning is an issue that exists \n     only for the purpose of pandering to a tiny slice of voters. \n     Supporters of the amendment cannot point to a single instance \n     of anti-American flag burning in the last 30 years. The video \n     images that the American Legion finds so offensive to \n     veterans and other Americans are either of Vietnam-era \n     vintage or from other countries.\n       Nevertheless, flag burning remains one of those ``wedge \n     issues'' that Republicans use to denigrate the patriotism of \n     Democratic candidates or to get the party's base out to vote.\n       The other big difference between the two amendments is that \n     the ban on gay marriage was never going to get the two-thirds \n     vote in Congress required to send it to the states for \n     ratification. Yesterday, the Senate rejected it by 49 to 48, \n     with the help of seven Republicans.\n       The flag-burning amendment, on the other hand, actually \n     could pass. A realistic nose count based on members' public \n     statements and how they voted when the measure last came up, \n     in 2000, suggests the Senate may be just a single vote short \n     of punching a hole in free speech.\n       Senator Harry Reid, the minority leader, should be rallying \n     Democrats to join the small handful of principled Republicans \n     so far willing to oppose the amendment. But as things stand, \n     he is among the Democrats who plan to vote for this \n     constitutional vandalism. Opponents of the amendment, like \n     Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, are standing on \n     firm ground in trying to protect the Bill of Rights from an \n     election-year stunt.\n       It is the patriotic thing to do.\n                                  ____\n\n\n         Congress Nears Choice: Protect Freedom or Stoke Anger?\n\n       In early June an allegedly drunken man in West Haven, \n     Conn., yelled racial epithets and tore up an American flag \n     while arguing with police and passersby. Earlier in the \n     spring, instances of vandalism involving flags were reported \n     in New Hampshire and New York.\n       Those three episodes of 2006--as compiled by the Citizens \n     Flag Alliance, a group pushing for a constitutional amendment \n     to protect the flag--constitute the raging menace of flag \n     desecration.\n       In fact, they show what a non-issue flag desecration is. \n     Instances are rare and easily addressed by local laws. They \n     hardly require the extraordinary act of amending the \n     Constitution.\n       But in a Congress unwilling to address important matters--\n     its own ruinous spending and flagrant corruption to name just \n     two--symbolism is the politically convenient substitute for \n     substance. The Senate will soon take up an amendment to stop \n     flag burning, and the vote is expected to be razor close. The \n     House of Representatives has passed it, meaning that it could \n     soon be sent to state legislatures, where it would be \n     ratified if three-quarters approve.\n       While it's tempting to dismiss this as trivial election-\n     year posturing, the precedent is troubling. It would for the \n     first time alter the cornerstone of American freedom, the \n     Constitution's First Amendment.\n       That is not a small matter. The First Amendment is the \n     reason Americans are free to say what they think. It is also \n     the reason people here can worship as they wish, associate \n     with whomever they please, and get news and information from \n     a free and independent press. It gives citizens a right to \n     have grievances redressed. To limit those rights--especially \n     for so trivial a reason--is to say they are no longer \n     sacrosanct.\n       They should be. They are what makes America unique.\n       If Congress banned something as pathetic as flag \n     desecration to score political points, surely it would \n     consider limiting other unpopular speech.\n       The amendment's wording virtually guarantees that outcome. \n     Would it, for instance, cover depictions of flags as well as \n     actual cloth banners? Would sitting on a flag patch sewn onto \n     the back of a pair of jeans count?\n       And what about the issue of flying a flag upside down? This \n     has already become the preferred form of protest for people \n     pushing for everything from an immediate withdrawal from Iraq \n     to better psychiatric care for veterans. These protesters \n     often say that they respect the values the flag represents, \n     but that they believe those values are being subverted by \n     people in power. Does this country really want to criminalize \n     such a nuanced form of political dissent?\n       These issues would be left to legislation drafted by future \n     Congresses and interpreted by courts. All of that, in turn, \n     would weaken individual rights that are at the Constitution's \n     heart.\n       And for what gain? Proponents of an amendment say the flag \n     is such an important symbol of American democracy that it \n     deserves a special status. But the Connecticut flag burner \n     was charged with seven offenses ranging from public \n     consumption of alcohol to criminal mischief. Surely, that is \n     sufficient.\n       In fact, what makes the flag so special is this: It stands \n     for a nation that deems individual liberties so important, it \n     tolerates unpopular minority opinion.\n       The main threat to the flag comes not from the occasional \n     burning of Old Glory. It comes from those who would sacrifice \n     the principles the flag represents.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [washingtonpost.com, June 21, 2006]\n\n                           Flag Burning Redux\n\n       With Congressional elections coming, the Republican \n     leadership has found a pivotal issue. Terrorism? Hardly. \n     Entitlement reform? Don't be silly. We're talking about the \n     grave threat to America known as flag burning. Yes, that \n     election-year favorite is back: the proposed amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States allowing Congress to \n     criminally punish the ``physical desecration'' of the \n     American national banner. If you haven't noticed a rash of \n     flag-burning incidents sweeping the nation that's because, \n     well, there isn't one. But that doesn't stop Republicans from \n     trotting it out as a more-patriotic-than-thou card.\n       They are, as always, close to having the votes to send it \n     to the states for ratification. The House of Representatives \n     has passed the measure and the vote will be tight in the \n     Senate, where the Judiciary Committee approved the amendment \n     11 to 7. We hope the amendment will fall short of the needed \n     two-thirds majority on the Senate floor; it's depressing \n     enough that a majority of senators will support it.\n       The amendment would soil the First Amendment's command that \n     Congress shall ``make no law . . . abridging the freedom of \n     speech.'' Flag burning is an odious form of expression. But \n     there are lots of odious forms of expression the First \n     Amendment protects: Holocaust denial and swastikas, racist \n     rants and giant Confederate flags, hammers and sickles. The \n     amendment's power is in its self-confident sweep: Speech, \n     including expressive acts, will not be censored. Government \n     cannot punish ideas. Members of Congress who would protect \n     the flag thus do it far greater damage than a few miscreants \n     with matches.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have spoken to the Senator from Utah, \nand I would like to ask how much time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I understand the Senator from Utah will then close.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, first, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Carper \nand Boxer be added as cosponsors to my pending amendment, and I ask \nunanimous consent that three commentaries in opposition to the flag \namendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Chicago Sun Times, June 21, 2006]\n\n           Ill-Starred Flag Amendment Would Do Nation No Good\n\n       Nearly 30 years after Cubs outfielder Rick Monday snatched \n     an American flag from two idiots at Dodger Stadium who had \n     doused it in lighter fluid and were trying to light it with a \n     match, we still applaud him for his exemplary act of \n     patriotism--for acting on our behalf. As devoted as we are to \n     free speech, we would have been hard-pressed to bottle our \n     anger over the desecration of the Stars and Stripes before \n     tens of thousands of spectators.\n       Our appreciation of Monday was not diminished by his \n     appearance last week at a rally for a proposed flag \n     desecration amendment--an event at which he exhibited the \n     rescued flag, which was presented to him by the Dodgers. But \n     however heartfelt this gesture was, it was wrongheaded in \n     lending support to a manufactured cause with no real value \n     except a political one, the equivalent of throwing red meat \n     on the table.\n       You would think, from the emotional momentum this issue has \n     gained in recent times, there is a pressing need for an anti-\n     flag-burning amendment. Most Americans are in favor of it. \n     The House has backed the amendment, and the Senate may well \n     follow suit next week, when it is scheduled to decide on the \n     constitutional ban. Reportedly, it is within a vote or two of \n     the two-thirds majority it needs. In 2000, it fell four votes \n     short.\n       But, in fact, this is a classic example of a solution in \n     search of a problem. Flag burnings, which most of us \n     associate with Vietnam-era protests, have all but disappeared \n     from the American landscape. No protests of the war in Iraq \n     (which have been relatively few) have featured flag \n     desecrations. The closest anyone has come to publicly \n     mistreating the flag, arguably, was a case of two athletes \n     wrapping themselves in it at the Olympics.\n\n[[Page S6544]]\n\n       You might also think this is an issue in need of legal \n     clarification. But, no, the Supreme Court ruled in 1989 that \n     as distasteful or offensive as this kind of protest is, it is \n     protected by the First Amendment. A year later, the high \n     court overturned the federal Flag Protection Act. The fact \n     that yet another effort is being mounted tells you not that \n     the principles have changed, but the political climate has. \n     Sorry, but that's not a good enough reason to alter the \n     Constitution.\n       This represents the consensus of the Sun-Times News Group \n     of 100 newspapers in the metro Chicago area.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           Emergency Committee to Defend the First Amendment\n\n       The following statement was released today by Professors \n     Norman Dorsen and Charles Fried, Co-chairs of the Emergency \n     Committee to Defend the First Amendment. The Committee is \n     composed of prominent Americans--conservative, moderate and \n     liberal--including former officials of the Reagan \n     Administration, former Republican members of Congress, senior \n     professors of constitutional law, several former presidents \n     of the American Bar Association, and leaders of other \n     national organizations.\n       The First Amendment to the United States Constitution has \n     served us since 1791 through wars, including a Civil War, and \n     crises of every sort without the need for amendment. It is an \n     icon of our freedom. To amend it now comes close to \n     vandalism.\n       The proposed constitutional amendment limits how people may \n     protest and sets a precedent for banning other forms of \n     dissent. If the flag, why not the Great Seal of the United \n     States or the Constitution? Why not the Bible or (to be \n     ecumenical) religious icons of all faiths? The founders of \n     this country would have been shocked at the notion that the \n     government could restrict ways by which the people can \n     protest conditions in the country or the government's own \n     policies.\n       As the Boston Tea Party illustrates, the founders were \n     familiar with symbolic protest. Moreover, the American \n     revolutionaries were also not exactly kind to their country's \n     flag, the Union Jack. George Washington ordered thirteen red \n     and white stripes sewn onto it and called it the ``Thirteen \n     Rebellious Stripes.'' Pennsylvania's first flag after \n     declaring independence was a British flag with a coiled \n     serpent ready to strike at the English ensign. These protests \n     ``desecrated'' the country's then-existing flag.\n       Totalitarian countries fear dissenters sufficiently to \n     suppress their protests. A free nation relies on having the \n     better argument. It is possible to burn a particular flag, \n     but no one can destroy the symbol and meaning of the flag. No \n     matter how many flags are burned, the American flag will \n     still exist, untarnished and waving bravely in the breeze.\n       The Emergency Committee urges the Senate to demonstrate the \n     sort of statesmanship of which it is capable by rejecting the \n     proposed constitutional amendment.\n\n\n           Emergency Committee to Defend the First Amendment:\n\n       Terry Anderson; Writer, former Journalist; Former Lebanese \n     Hostage.\n       Derek Bok; President, Harvard University (1971-1991); Dean, \n     Harvard Law School (1968-1971).\n       Clint Bolick; Litigation Director, Institute for Justice.\n       Benjamin Civiletti; Partner, Venable, Baetjer & Howard; \n     U.S. Attorney General (1979-1981).\n       John J.

Res. 12, the Flag ``Desecration'' \n         Constitutional Amendment.\n       Dear Senator: As the Commander of American Legion Post #315 \n     in San Francisco, CA, I write to urge you to oppose S.J. Res. \n     12, the proposed constitutional amendment to prohibit \n     ``desecration'' of the flag. Although the national American \n     Legion leadership supports this amendment, I wish to express \n     my disagreement with that position and my dismay with the \n     apparent willingness of Congress to amend the First Amendment \n     to restrict free speech.\n       Acts of burning or otherwise defacing the flag are rare, \n     but they can be a powerful form of expression. I should be \n     clear that it saddens me to think of those who would damage \n     the flag, but I believe it my duty to defend their right to \n     do so. The flag stands for freedom, yet this constitutional \n     amendment would diminish fundamental freedoms by undermining \n     the right to free expression guaranteed by the Bill of \n     Rights.\n       American Legion posts across the country recently marked \n     the passing of Flag Day by organizing flag burning ceremonies \n     to dispose of worn and damaged flags. Proponents of the flag \n     amendment say they seek to ban an act, not a form of \n     expression. Surely they do not mean to ban respectful flag \n     disposal ceremonies like these. Rather, they seek to prohibit \n     acts of flag desecration that are intended to convey a \n     certain political message. When the founders drafted the \n     First Amendment, they intended to protect peaceful \n     expression, however unpopular and offensive. In fact, it is \n     precisely such unpopular speech that requires the protection \n     afforded by the Constitution.\n       There is significant diversity of opinion among veterans in \n     general and American Legion members in particular on this \n     issue. In fact, just last year a past National Commander of \n     the Legion, Keith Kreul, gave Senate testimony in opposition \n     to the flag amendment. I suggest, as Mr. Kreul did, that this \n     amendment is not an appropriate way to honor the service of \n     this nation's veterans. There are many pressing concerns \n     facing our veterans and active duty troops, including \n     shortfalls in funding for veterans healthcare and daily \n     dangers facing troops serving in Iraq. The flag amendment is \n     an unfortunate distraction from these issues.\n       If passed, the flag amendment would constitute the first-\n     ever restriction on the Bill of Rights. I urge you to oppose \n     this measure. In doing so, you will defend the true spirit of \n     the Constitution, and the freedoms for which the flag stands.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           Sharon Lee Kufeldt,\n\n                            Commander, American Legion Post # 315,\n                                           U.S. Air Force Veteran.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, you have heard the debate for 2 days now. \nOn one side of the aisle, those supporting this amendment have \nsummarized their feelings in three words: Respect the flag. On the \nother side of the debate are those who say: Respect the Constitution. \nThey understand that what we are being asked to do is historic. Senator \nByrd has reminded us. This would be the first time in the history of \nthe United States of America that we would amend the Bill of Rights.\n  It is a historic moment. And it takes some audacity and bravado for \nany sitting Member of the U.S. Senate to believe they have a better \nidea than James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, and our Founding Fathers had \nover 200 years ago. It takes a special circumstance for us to even \nconsider changing that beloved first amendment, which has guided us for \nmore than two centuries.\n  The incidents of flag burning are rare. They are disgusting. But \nthere are ways we can deal with this without defiling this \nConstitution.\n  Senator Hatch's amendment says do not desecrate the flag. I believe \nwe should not desecrate the Constitution. There is a way. The pending \namendment points to the way: a Federal criminal statute carefully drawn \nto meet the Supreme Court test that would really deal with preserving \nand protecting the flag as we know it, as an important symbol of \nAmerica, without invading our Bill of Rights. And the second part of my \namendment which I am offering is one that you know about because you \nhear about it all the time.\n  There is this demented group--I will not even give the full name of \nthis church from Topeka, KS, because I do not want to give them any \npublicity. But this demented group is appearing now at military \nfunerals, the funerals of veterans and soldiers, demonstrating. Here \nthey are issuing a press release that says: ``Thank God for IEDs \n(Improvised Explosive Devices),'' announcing they are coming to my home \nState of Illinois to picket the funeral of Army SPC Brian Romines, who \nwas 20 years old, at the Anna Heights Baptist Church in Anna, IL. It is \ndisgusting: this family, racked with grief,\n\n[[Page S6545]]\n\ntrying to get through the most difficult day of their lives, having to \nwalk through the lines of demonstrators this demented person would \nbring to the funeral.\n  Well, the Senator from Idaho has said on the floor that I have gone \ntoo far with my amendment, I have gone too far in limiting these \ndemonstrations at military funerals. I think he is wrong. These \ndemonstrations are wrong not just in national cemeteries, they are \nwrong in all cemeteries. They are wrong at all churches. They are wrong \nat all funerals. And the Senate will have a chance, with my amendment, \nto vote and say that we will limit this kind of disgusting activity \nthat disrespects the men and women who have fought and died for \nAmerica.\n  That is the amendment before us, an amendment to protect our flag and \nto protect the memory of those who have fought and died for our \ncountry. I am proud to offer this bipartisan amendment. It is an \namendment which, at the end of the day, we can point to with pride \nbecause we have done something important.\n  But I urge my colleagues, think long and hard about being the first \nto amend the Bill of Rights in the history of the United States of \nAmerica. We have given our oath to uphold and defend that Constitution. \nToday we will be put to the test. Will we uphold and defend that \nConstitution from a change that is totally unnecessary?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, what does the Bill of Rights have to do \nwith this? That argument is not a valid argument. Look at what the \namendment says:\n\n       The Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical \n     desecration of the flag of the United States.\n\n  There is no interference with the Bill of Rights. Yet the Senator--\nthe Senators--who want to so-called protect the Bill of Rights have \ncome up with a statute that does exactly the opposite, according to \ntheir way of looking at it.\n  Frankly, there are only five Justices who said that defecating on the \nflag, urinating on the flag, burning it with contempt, and stomping on \nit is not a violation of the first amendment.\n  But this amendment does not have anything to do with that. All this \namendment says is that we are going to give the power back to the \npeople and to the people's representatives in Congress, and they will \nmake the determination as to how we protect the flag, if they decide \nto. In other words, we are going to restore the Constitution to what it \nwas before these unelected five Justices on the Supreme Court changed \nit. And four others disagreed with them.\n  By the way, the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts said this is \nelection-year politics. I wonder how he explains the 6 years in a row \nthat the House of Representatives, in bipartisan votes, has passed \nthis amendment by the requisite two-thirds vote? I wonder how he is \ngoing to explain that 48 States had antiflag desecration statutes \nbefore the Supreme Court wiped all of that out and all of the people's \nwork and all of the people's will out. What is he going to say about \nthe 50 States, including his, that have petitioned us for this \namendment? Fifty State legislatures have asked for this amendment.\n\n  There are 60 cosponsors in the Senate. There are at least six others \nwho have always voted to protect the flag. I question whether all six \nof those will vote for this. But the fact is, they should because they \nhave always voted for it. So there are at least 66 people who should be \nvoting for it.\n  There is no narrowing of the Bill of Rights by this amendment. That \nargument would have to take place after this amendment passes by the \ntwo-thirds vote, if it could, and then is ratified by 38 States. Then \nthere would be a debate where they could raise all the issues they want \nabout the first amendment, faulty though they are.\n  The fact is that I was asked this afternoon by a large body of media: \nIs this the most important thing the Senate could be doing at this \ntime? I can tell you, you're darn right it is. The fact is, we had five \nunelected Justices who overturned 100 years of Supreme Court precedent, \nbacking up 48 States that have had antiflag desecration amendments. We \nhave had 50 States ask for a change here so we can go back to \nprotecting our flag.\n  What we would be doing is sending a message to the Court: You cannot \nusurp the power of the Congress of the United States. That is what is \ninvolved. I hear time after time complaints about the courts usurping \nthe powers of the Congress and other branches usurping the powers of \nthe Congress. Here is a chance to bring that power back to the Congress \nwhere it belongs and then have that debate. It would still take 60 \nvotes because of the opposition of some. It would still take 60 votes \nto pass a statute if we could pass this amendment.\n  The fact is, if you want to respect the Constitution, let's restore \nit to what the Constitution was before five unelected jurists changed \nthat Constitution. The fact is, this amendment is one of the most \nimportant things we can do to send a message to the U.S. Supreme Court \nthat: You cannot usurp the power of the legislative branch of this \nGovernment.\n  It does nothing about the Bill of Rights. That would have to be \nargued later if we pass this amendment and have it ratified. Then we \ncould argue about the Bill of Rights later. And I will bet you money, \nthe only reason Senators are claiming the Bill of Rights is to try to \njustify their vote. But now, if they believe the Bill of Rights is \nbeing interfered with, then why would they come up with a statute to do \nthe very same thing they are saying this amendment does? Why have they \nalways come up with a statute that basically, if you use their logic, \ninvades the first amendment to the Constitution? Why would they do \nthat? There is only one reason. It is a political reason to cover their \nbacksides.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in a few moments we will be voting on the \ntwo amendments, which really follows the good debate we have had since \nyesterday when we began debate on this flag protection amendment. As I \npromised early in the year, I brought this joint resolution to the \nfloor this week in part in anticipation of the Fourth of July recess--a \ntime when all of us go back and think about the flag and the enduring \nideals of freedom and opportunity that it represents.\n  It has been 6 years since we have had that debate on this floor. It \nis something that comes to the House each and every Congress, and they \nvote on that. So I felt it would be appropriate. Indeed, in listening \nto the debate--the Constitution issues and the importance of the flag--\nI have been very pleased, and I hope that debate reflects passage of \nthe amendment in a few moments.\n  It is my hope, when we return to our home States next week or later \nthis weekend to celebrate the anniversary of America's independence, we \nwill be able to tell our fellow citizens that we did the right thing \nhere in Congress and voted to give Congress the power to protect the \nStars and Stripes.\n  Americans have so much to be proud of. We enjoy a greater measure of \nliberty and justice and equality than any other country in human \nhistory. Millions upon millions of people have come to these shores \nseeking a better life, and they have found it here. We are a nation of \nhopeful, resourceful people who continually strive to live up to our \nideals and provide greater and better opportunities for our children. \nThere is one symbol that above all others encapsulates that hope, that \nfreedom, our history and our values, and that is the American flag.\n  From the time we are schoolchildren, we honor our flag and all it \nstands for. With our hand over our heart, each morning here in this \nbody, the U.S. Senate, we honor it. In times of crisis, raising those \nStars and Stripes has symbolized our unity, our perseverance as a \nnation, as a people. Whether it is the marine struggling to plant the \nflag on Iwo Jima or firefighters lifting the flag above the ruins of \nthe World Trade Center, it is that flag which inspires us to great acts \nof heroism, of courage, of strength.\n  Unfortunately, however, there are no laws on the books to stop anyone \nfrom destroying this cherished symbol. Although the vast majority of \nAmericans--over 80 percent--and all 50 of our State legislatures \nbelieve the flag\n\n[[Page S6546]]\n\nshould be protected, the Federal Government is currently powerless to \nenforce flag protection laws. That is because in 1989, as we talked \nabout, the Supreme Court, in a 5-to-4 decision, overturned 200 years of \nprecedent and struck down all laws prohibiting flag desecration. As our \ncolleague from Utah just said, it was a one-vote margin, 5 to 4, with \nfive Judges stripping the right of the American people--through their \nvoice, through this body--to protect that flag. It is my hope and \nreally my purpose in bringing that amendment to the floor to reverse \nthis decision, this activist decision, and return to the American \npeople the ability to protect the flag, if they so wish.\n  So in a few minutes in the Senate, we are going to have a vote to \nreturn to the people, through this body, the opportunity to protect the \nflag. And it is one single, simple sentence:\n\n       The Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical \n     desecration of the flag of the United States.\n\n  That is what we will be voting on. Key words: ``The Congress shall \nhave the power.'' All 50 States have passed resolutions calling on the \nCongress to pass a flag amendment. The House passed a constitutional \namendment to protect against desecration of the American flag in this \nCongress and in the last Congress, in the last Congress, in the last \nCongress, in the last Congress, and in the last Congress, and now it is \ntime for us to do the same. We have failed to muster those two-thirds \nvotes in the past.\n  Today, we have a new opportunity to change that and to honor the \nwishes of the American people. We are a Nation founded on principles. \nOur flag is what binds us to those principles, to one another; it is \nthat physical symbol of our values, liberty, justice, freedom, and \nindependence. It commands our loyalty. To countless people around the \nworld, the red, white, and blue represents the highest of human \nideals--freedom.\n  I know we have heard again and again through the media the whole \nissue about flag burning being protected as an exercise of free speech. \nBut is defacing a Government building free speech? Do we let our \nmonuments be vandalized? Clearly, the answer is no. I believe that our \nAmerican flag deserves the same respect. America is the freest country \nin the world and we have the right to express dissent and persuade \nfellow citizens of our views. But destroying the very emblem of that \nfreedom is just plain wrong. Countless brave men and women have died \ndefending the flag. It is but a small, humble act for us to defend it.\n  I will close with the words of our esteemed colleague, Senator Hatch, \nwho has done such a wonderful job in managing this particular bill and \na tireless advocate for the amendment. Here are his words:\n\n       Whatever our differences of party, race, religion, or \n     socioeconomic status, the flag reminds us that we are very \n     much one people, united in a shared destiny, bonded in a \n     common faith in our Nation and the profound belief in \n     personal liberty that our Nation protects.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to make a statement \nexplaining my vote. I wonder if that is in order at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I had tried to get time earlier in the \nday. Unfortunately, I was tied up in a markup. I want to express myself \nbriefly on the constitutional amendment.\n  I opposed it, even though clearly it was far more popular in the \ncountry to support it. I did so because of my love of our country, our \nConstitution, and our freedoms. The love of country runs deep in my \nveins, as I know it does in those of every Senator.\n  My family came here in the early years of the 20th century to be safe \nfrom the Holocaust in Europe, the nightmare that took the lives of our \nrelatives and so many innocent people. To my family and to me, America \nwas not only a land of strength and courage but a land of compassion \nand acceptance. My father, who was a CPA, always said to me: Kiss the \nground when you pay your taxes to America because you are helping to \nbuild our military, our schools, our roads, and our infrastructure.\n  My mother said that being an American meant being free to live your \ndreams, and only in this country, she would say, in America, where she \nwas brought as a baby by her family, would that be possible.\n  I was taught not to be afraid of disagreement, not to fear words and \nnot\n\n[[Page S6547]]\n\nto shrink from an argument in this, the greatest country on Earth. In a \ngreat country like the United States of America, you don't fear \ndissent. In a great country you allow dissent, even if it is ugly, even \nif it makes you sick to your stomach, even if it disgusts you. We are \nso strong as a Nation that we know if someone takes one of our \nbeautiful symbols and destroys it or burns it or spits on it or steps \non it, that person will not win respect but will lose it. That person \nwill not win friends but in fact will turn people away. That person \nwill gain nothing for his cause but, in fact, will be ridiculed and \nmarginalized.\n  Now if a flag is burned or if a copy of the Bill of Rights or a copy \nof the Constitution is burned and that act is meant to incite others \nand it places people in danger, we should have laws to punish those who \nwould endanger other lives. That is why I was proud to support the \nBennett-Clinton-Durbin amendment, to do just that. I can certainly \nunderstand how seeing our flag burn would inflame passions and incite \noutrage. It does so in me.\n  The flag to me is a symbol of something I hold near and dear to my \nheart--our democracy, our country, our history. And I am outraged when \nI think about someone treating the flag in a disrespectful manner. But \nI am also outraged when I see or hear about a group of people \nprotesting at the funeral of a fallen soldier, saying things like \n``thank God for dead soldiers'' or ``God is America's terrorist.'' That \nis what is going on today at soldiers' funerals.\n  Such despicable speech and disrupting the most sacred funerals of our \nheroes makes no sense to me, and I can't begin to imagine the emotions \nof the families of the soldiers who must endure these senseless \nprotests at a time of such loss. My instinct is to haul these \nprotesters away. My colleague, Senator Durbin, proposed an amendment \nthat would prohibit these awful protests at all funerals for our fallen \nheroes, regardless of where the funerals take place, whether at a \nnational or private cemetery, a funeral home or a house of worship. I \nwas proud to support that amendment, and I was stunned to see how many \nof my colleagues turned away from it.\n  I agree with the approach of Senator Durbin to the protests--\nproposing a statutory solution to address a problem rather than \nunnecessarily amending our Constitution. There are many things in life \nthat we find offensive, repugnant to beliefs that we hold dear, but we \ncannot amend the Constitution every time there is something we consider \noutrageous, offensive, or repugnant.\n  We have only amended our Constitution 16 times after the Bill of \nRights was passed in 1791--16 times over 214 years. But the Republican \nleadership has decided the best use of our precious little working time \nis to amend the Constitution--not amend it to guarantee equal rights \nfor women, which still has not been done, not to amend it to allow \nlimits on wealthy individuals buying Federal office--but for an issue \nwhich I believe we can address by statute, as I believe Senators \nBennett and Clinton and Durbin did.\n  Some have suggested that this constitutional amendment is necessary \nto honor our veterans. I think Senator Specter spoke eloquently on the \npoint. I say, if we want to honor our veterans we should take care of \nour brave men and women in uniform who serve our Nation.\n  For example, just last week my good friend from Maine, Senator Snowe, \nand I were able to get an amendment agreed to by the Senate which would \nmake all prisoners of war who die in captivity eligible for the Purple \nHeart. Also last week Senator Lieberman and I were able to get an \namendment agreed to by the Senate improving the mental health screening \nand monitoring for members of our Armed Forces.\n  I think we honor our veterans and Armed Forces when we make sure that \nwe are looking out for them, keeping our promises to them. Right now we \nare not.\n  We should provide them with all the equipment they need while they \nare deployed and all the health care they need when they come home.\n  Let's make sure our men and women have adequate body armor. Let's \nfind ways to expand health care coverage for the members of the Guard \nand Reserves. Let's make sure the Veterans Administration is adequately \nfunded to meet the needs of our veterans at a time when we are seeing \nhorrific post-traumatic stress: suicides are up, divorces are up. These \nare the ways we honor our veterans.\n\n  We love the flag--yes. We love our veterans--yes. But I think we can \ndo both without having to amend the Constitution.\n  I believe the flag is a beautiful symbol of the freedom and liberty \non which this proud Nation has been built. The flag is a reminder of \nthe democracy we all hold so dear in our hearts. When I see the flag \ndisplayed in an inappropriate way--I think Senator Lautenberg showed \nit--on underwear or on pajamas, I don't think that is respectful. But \nthat is what we see every day. I don't like it, but, you know what, \nthis Constitution is more than an outlet for our justifiable \nfrustrations. This Constitution is more than just an outlet for our \njustifiable frustrations.\n  It is concise. It has worked. It is the enduring ideal of our Nation, \nand we should not unnecessarily amend it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, seeing a number of my colleagues on the \nfloor, and I have talked to them, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing Senators be able to speak in morning business as follows, in \nthis order: Senator Salazar for 5 minutes, Senators Wyden and Smith for \na total of 10 minutes, and Senator DeWine for 45 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the flag \ndesecration amendment and talk about the nature of the debate we have \nseen in the Senate over the last 2 days. First, let me be clear. I \nsupport the amendment that came before the Senate today, and I just \ncast my vote for it. The American flag is a unique symbol of our \nheritage, our principles, and everything the citizens of this great \ncountry have done to sacrifice for it. I do not believe laws narrowly \nprohibiting the desecration of our flag in any way undercut the \nprinciples embedded in the first amendment.\n  However, it is important to emphasize certain points as we debate \nthese issues. First, as is often the case when we consider whether to \namend the Constitution, this is not a simple question. It is not a \nquestion that is cut and dried.\n  I understand the strong feelings of those who oppose this amendment. \nI understand their argument that the freedoms the American flag stands \nfor, including the freedom of speech and expression, are as important \nas the flag itself. We must not separate the flag from the cherished \nprinciples that it represents.\n  In keeping with that concept, I believe it is wrong for proponents of \nthe flag desecration amendment to question the patriotism of those who \noppose it. Simply because Senator Durbin, Senator McConnell, Senator \nFeingold, Senator Bennett, and others oppose this amendment does not \nmean they believe the flag should be desecrated, nor does it mean that \nthey view the flag as any less important a symbol. As anyone who has \nworked with these Senators knows, nothing could be further from the \ntruth.\n  Finally, my support for this amendment is based on the premise that \nthe flag is unique and deserves special protection. But for the same \nreason I believe the flag should be protected, I also firmly believe it \nshould not be politicized for partisan gain. The American citizens who \npledge allegiance to this flag, who believe in what it represents, and \nwho live and work under it every day deserve better.\n  I also believe that we should be working as a Congress and as a \nSenate just as hard to strengthen our national and homeland security, \nimprove our energy security, relieve the health care crisis that faces \nAmerica's businesses and America's families, educate our children, and \nstrengthen the American family.\n  I yield the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in the midst of all the serious business \nthat is before the Senate, I and my good friend from Oregon, Senator \nSmith, wanted to take a few minutes tonight and talk to the Senate \nabout the great pride and joy that Oregonians are feeling tonight as a \nresult of our terrific Oregon State Beavers who have won the college \nworld series.\n  Showing incredible determination, they would not give up spirit. \nAfter losing their first games in both the tournament and in the \nchampionship series, the players at Oregon State and the coaching staff \ncame back. They came back to be the first team since 1998 to lose their \nfirst game and go on to win the college title.\n  Senator Smith and I are especially proud because in this day of \nprofessional sports seeming to be part of every college environment, \nmost of these players are from Oregon. They come from almost every nook \nand cranny of our State. They come from the Pacific Northwest, and they \nrepresent the best values of our State--particularly hard work and a \nsense that if you just stay at it and you are persistent, you can get \nthe job done.\n  We want to salute all the players, and particularly three we are \ngoing to be losing--three star pitchers: Jonah Nickerson, Dallas Buck, \nand Kevin Gunderson. They are going on to play professional next \nseason. But we are going to be back in that world series next year.\n  I get a chance, along with my colleague, to enjoy so much that makes \nour State special. We try to team up on a bipartisan basis on some \nissues. But we are particularly thrilled as Oregonians' two U.S. \nSenators to make sure that the country sees that when you work hard, \nyou play by the rules, and you don't give up, nearly always good things \nhappen.\n  Tonight, Oregonians are wearing the orange and black of the Beavers.\n  I want to yield the rest of my time to my friend and colleague \nbecause, as Oregonians' two U.S. Senators, we are savoring this moment \nalong with more than 3 million people who represent our State. I yield \nthe remainder of my time to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I rise proudly with my colleague, Senator Wyden. We are proud \nOregonians every day but especially this day as we celebrate the great \naccomplishments of the Beavers of our State.\n  I suppose we are honorary members, neither of us having attended \nOregon State, to be now members of ``Beaver Nation,'' as it is known \nlocally.\n  These great players, these great young men, overcame all the odds to \nwin the college world series and become the NCAA Division I Baseball \nChampions. In doing so, the Beavers not only brought home to OSU its \nfirst NCAA championship in any sport since 1916, they also became the \nfirst northern climate team to win the college world series.\n  We are very proud of them. They did it with a team full of young men \nfrom the greater Pacific Northwest, many of them from Oregon.\n  Under the leadership of their coach, Pat Casey, OSU made ``Beaver \nbelievers'' of many people--virtually all of Oregon. I think all of \nOregon was tuned in yesterday to see their thrilling 3-to-2 victory.\n  While at the college world series in Omaha, they played eight games, \nand in six of those games they knew if they lost they went home. Well, \nthey kept winning against all odds, and they come home to Corvallis, \nOR, champions of this great sport.\n  I suppose one of the things I look forward to is every year it seems \nas if an Oregon team gets to participate in what has become a White \nHouse tradition. That is when they meet with the President of the \nUnited States. I look forward especially this year to being able to not \njust congratulate the Oregon State University Beavers for this \nremarkable accomplishment, I look forward to escorting them with my \ncolleague, Senator Wyden, to the White House to meet America's No. 1 \nbaseball fan, President Bush, for this great traditional ceremony of \nhonoring the NCAA champs.\n  I stand before you, Mr. President, a ``Beaver Believer'' and thankful \nfor the good job they did in bringing such distinction to our State.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, Senator Smith said it very well.\n  I wanted to wrap up by noting a comment from pitcher Dallas Buck, who \nwas the winning pitcher in the championship game.\n  When asked about why he stayed at Oregon State instead of going pro \nout of high school, I quote: ``Best decision I ever made.'' And we \nhappen to think that is the best decision a lot of young people are \nmaking in our State, to go to Oregon State University. It is a \nwonderful university, both for sports and academics.\n  We are going to salute them, as Senator Smith has indicated, when we \nget a chance to join them at the White House with the President. That \nis what makes this so special for us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I commemorate a woman who dedicated \nher life to helping others: Denise Weisenborn. Living in Parma, OH, \nDenise was a lawyer and advocate of employment and independence for \npeople with disabilities. Denise, who had muscular dystrophy, used a \nwheelchair all of her life, but never let that stop her from \naccomplishing her goals. Denise was 51 years old at the time of her \ndeath on May 2, 2006. She is survived by her mother Mary Lucille and \nher sister Diane.\n  Denise spent her entire life overcoming obstacles and then exceeding \nall expectations. Even though she was unable to attend school, Denise \nhad tutors help her at home during her younger years. As a student at \nMaple Heights High School, Denise was able to take part in classes \nwhile she was home. In 1972, Denise graduated as class valedictorian.\n  She carried on this legacy of academic success by majoring in foreign \nlanguages at Cleveland State University, graduating summa cum laude in \n1976. Denise then attended Cleveland Marshall College of Law, where she \nserved as an interpreter and finished in the top 20 percent of her \nclass in 1980. She passed the bar exam later that year. These \naccomplishments were just the beginning of the amazing things Denise \nWeisenborn would accomplish throughout her life.\n  Denise worked in Columbus as an education lawyer for Ohio Legal \nRights Services, where she helped families of children with \ndisabilities get the educational services they needed. She presented a \nfederal case, Roncker v. Walter, in the U.S. Court of Appeals Sixth \nCircuit. Eventually, the severity of her disability made a 40-hour work \nweek very difficult, and she moved back to Cleveland to be closer to \nher supportive family.\n  She continued to give her talents to help people with disabilities by \nserving on the Ohio Developmental Disabilities Council, the Governor's \nCouncil on People with Disabilities and the Ohio Rehabilitation \nServices Commission.\n  She also was an area representative for Assistive Technology of Ohio \nin the Cleveland area, where she developed medical equipment loan \nprograms for medical goods and adaptive equipment, as well as compiling \na directory of service providers.\n  Firmly believing that people with disabilities should be able to live \nindependently, Denise moved from her parents' home to a federally-\nsubsidized apartment building in Parma for people with physical \ndisabilities and urged officials to build additional homes of this \nkind. Denise also called for home-based employment opportunities for \npeople with disabilities.\n  She was a champion of a program called ``Choices,'' funded through \nthe Ohio Developmental Disabilities Council, where volunteers provided \nencouragement and community support to people with disabilities who \nlived in nursing homes but wanted to live independently in the \ncommunity.\n  Many people were skeptical that this program would work, but Denise \nbelieved in the project. As a result of her leadership, hundreds of \nOhioans with disabilities are now living independently in community \nsettings. Denise's advocacy has helped so many people in both their \npersonal and professional lives.\n\n[[Page S6549]]\n\n  Denise was a person of great faith, dedicating a substantial portion \nof her time to helping others in their own spiritual journeys. She \ndemonstrated this commitment through her work with Rainbow Girls and \nthe InterVarsity Christian Fellowship at college. She served as a \ncounsel and Bible study leader for the Billy Graham Crusade in \nCleveland and organized and led Bible studies for church youth. Denise \nonce said, ``Of all my experiences, the one which has had the most \nprofound influence on my life, and for which I will be eternally \njoyous, is the time I gave my life and opened my heart to my Savior, \nJesus Christ. Much of my time each day is spent in talking to my Friend \nand studying His Word.''\n  Denise was a gifted lawyer. She volunteered her talents to non-profit \nagencies that helped people with disabilities. She served on the board \nof commissioners of a large state agency that helped people with \ndisabilities. And she lobbied the state and federal government for the \nbetterment of people like herself.\n  For all these efforts, this attorney with 26 years of experience \nearned about $5,000 per year. It is a sad irony that although Denise \nwas learned in the law, it was the law--and not her disability--that \nkept her from earning a living. For Denise, however, having a low \nincome was an act of survival. Denise's health care was covered by \nMedicaid. Denise had muscular dystrophy. It affected her speech; her \nvoice was soft and quiet, making it difficult to hear her in a crowded \nroom. She relied heavily on assistive technology for independence. She \nused a power wheelchair for mobility and operated her computer by \npointing a laser at an on screen keyboard. She required 24-hour \npersonal attendant care and too frequently her life was interrupted by \nextended and expensive stays in the hospital when her health declined.\n  Given the severity of her disability, there were no other options for \nher. The law in Ohio prevented her from earning more money without \nlosing her health care. She was given a Hobson's choice--she had to \nchoose between making a living and living at all.\n  This is why Denise Weisenborn spent the last years of her life \nfighting for a Medicaid Buy-In program in Ohio. These programs, \nallowable in States under federal law since 1999, give people with \ndisabilities the right to earn more money, and pay premiums to the \nState to help cover their health care costs. Medicaid Buy-In removes \nthe powerful, institutional disincentive for people with disabilities \nto work.\n  If Ohio had a Buy-In program, Denise Weisenborn could have been even \nmore independent by earning a living, helping Ohio cover her health \ncare costs, and paying taxes.\n  Simply put, she could have been a lawyer. It is the independence for \nwhich she fought and wanted so deeply, and it is shame that Ohio did \nnot give her that chance before she passed away.\n  It is something that I think those of us who reside in Ohio should \nthink about and consider. It would be a fitting tribute to her life for \nus to take the appropriate action in Ohio to change the status quo. and \nto give people like Denise the opportunity to move forward and to work \nand not have to give up the health care, not have to give up the \nsupport that enables them to live, not have to make the choice Denise \nhad to make.\n\n  Denise Weisenborn led a full and personally enriching life. She \nfought for people with disabilities and their right to find and sustain \nemployment and to live independently. She dedicated her life to \nservice, and Ohioans with disabilities are much better for her efforts. \nThey are much better for the fact that she lived.\n  Mr. President, I continue to keep the family and friends of Denise \nWeisenborn in my thoughts and prayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/27/senate-section/article/S6549-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6549-S6550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                    Lance Corporal David Mendez Ruiz\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, this evening, I come to the floor to pay \ntribute to a brave Ohioan, Marine LCpl David Mendez Ruiz, who was \nkilled on November 12, 2005--the day after Veterans Day--by a homemade \nbomb while conducting combat operations in Iraq. He was only 20 years \nold.\n  Ronald Reagan once said:\n\n       [S]ome people live an entire lifetime and wonder if they \n     have ever made a difference in the world. The Marines don't \n     have that problem.\n\n  The family and friends of David Mendez Ruiz will indeed never doubt \nthe great difference this young man made in the world--both as a \nmarine, as a friend, brother, and son.\n  David was the youngest of eight children, born to Maximiliano and \nMiriam Mendez. The family moved to the United States from Guatemala \nwhen David was 6 years old.\n  At David's funeral, the service began with the Guatemalan national \nanthem, followed by ``The Star-Spangled Banner.'' David had a profound \nrespect for his roots and a great love and appreciation for the United \nStates--the country for which he would eventually give his life. \nDavid's parents instilled in him at an early age a deep reverence and \nlove for God and for his country.\n  David was baptized at and was a member of Cleveland's House of Praise \nand Prayer, where he was like a son to Eli and Amy Ramos, the church's \nyouth pastors. Before leaving for his second tour of duty in Iraq, \nDavid gave Eli a sound system for his car as a gift to repay him for \nall the times he had spent with him through the years. He wanted Eli to \nremember him each time he listened to Christian music on his stereo. As \nEli has said:\n\n       That's the way it is. Each time I get into my car, and I \n     put that music on really loud, I remember David. David was a \n     youth full of life, and that is why we all fell in love with \n     him.\n\n  Indeed, David was full of life and so dedicated to his faith. He \nregularly attended Sunday church services in Iraq, even though he was \nthousands of miles away from his home church.\n  Family and friends remember David as a friendly, honorable, \ncompassionate, and courageous man. They describe his huge smile that \nhid his eyes and brightened a room upon his entry. David was known for \nhaving a heart that couldn't say no to someone in need and a love of \nGod and a love of country that motivated him to join the Marines in the \nfirst place. David loved being a marine.\n  He had spent almost 8 months in Iraq, returned home, and broke his \nback during a snowboarding accident. After recuperating, David left to \nreturn to Iraq on the Fourth of July. At David's funeral, close friend \nBrandon Joffre, who went to high school with David at the Greater \nCleveland Christian Academy in Middleburg Heights, told mourners that \nDavid had always dreamed of joining the service. This is what he said:\n\n       He always wanted to be in the military, real hard core, \n     definitely born to be a marine. That's the thing. He was \n     killed, but he was killed doing something he loved.\n       He wanted to be there. I expected to grow up and [have] our \n     kids hang out [together], and I'd see him get married and all \n     that. It's hard. Every time I see a picture of him with that \n     smile, I want to cry.\n\n  Gillian Newman, a friend of David's Since elementary school, told \nthose gathered at the funeral that she loved watching movies with \nDavid. They would have great fun trying to remember the lines from the \nmovies, even months later. Most of all, she says that she loved his \nkind spirit. ``We could challenge him to a game of pool 150 times, and \nhe could beat us every time and never say, `I told you [so] .' ''\n  David's friend Brandon also shared that sentiment:\n\n       David lived a very honorable life and accomplished a lot in \n     such a short period of time. Words do not describe how proud \n     I am of David. God had a plan for David's life, and David \n     served him well. He was always happy, always had a smile on \n     his face. He made friends everywhere he went.\n\n  Fellow Marine Marcial Rodriguez, wrote the following words about \nDavid:\n\n       When I heard the news last November that U.S. Marine David \n     Mendez Ruiz, a Hispanic immigrant from Cleveland, died in \n     Iraq, my thoughts were a little strong. I felt pride, but at \n     the same time, anger--pride because David was fulfilling a \n     dream like many young people, to serve by fighting in the \n     U.S. Marines. Even though some people criticized him, he kept \n     serving his country.\n       He lost his life without surrendering to anything, fighting \n     for his country, for a just cause, with honor. I feel anger \n     because many Hispanic young people like us struggle to give \n     Hispanics a good name so that Americans don't think we only \n     cause problems--so that Americans can see that we too, the \n     Hispanic people, contribute our grain of sand, like David's \n     sister Sandra said. . . . That's how David wanted to live his \n     life--with pride, in peace.\n\n\n[[Page S6550]]\n\n\n  Mr. President, and Members of the Senate, David demonstrated his \ncommitment to service in so many ways, but his long record of awards \nspeaks for itself. He received the Combat Action Ribbon, the National \nDefense Service Medal, the War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, the \nWar on Terrorism Service Medal, and two Sea Service Deployment Ribbons. \nDavid also received the Purple Heart Medal.\n  David Mendez Ruiz was a young man who exemplified courage under \npressure and who always strived to make life a little better for those \naround him. The Greater Cleveland Christian Academy has set up a \nscholarship in his memory, so that his legacy can live on through the \neducation of other students. There is no better way to carry on the \nmemory of this brave young American who lost his life while fighting to \nensure that we can continue to enjoy freedom and opportunity.\n  Mr. President, David Mendez Ruiz is a true hero and proved his \nunwavering allegiance to the United States in the most selfless way--by \ngiving his life in service to our country. My wife, Fran and I continue \nto keep David's large and wonderful family and his many friends in our \nthoughts and in our prayers.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague on the Senate floor. I have about \n10 more minutes.\n\n\n                     Staff Sergeant Kendall Ivy II\n\n  Mr. President, this evening I would like to speak in honor of Marine \nSSgt Kendall Ivy II, a 28-year-old Ohioan who lost his life on May 11, \n2005. He was killed by a roadside bomb while serving our country in \nIraq.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Marine SSG Kendall \nIvy, II, a 28-year-old Ohioan who lost his life on May 11, 2005. He was \nkilled by a roadside bomb while serving our country in Iraq.\n  A native of Galion, OH, Kendall was a well-known football and \nbaseball athlete at Galion High School, where he graduated in 1995. He \njoined the military right after high school, applying these athletic \nskills of teamwork to the Marine Corps. After the military, Kendall was \nplanning to continue his education and become a history teacher and \ncoach.\n  Most important to Kendall was his family, consisting of his wife, Lee \nAnn, sons, Caleb and Harrison, daughter, Reagan, and parents, Raymond \nand Venita ``Kay'' Ivy. Additionally, Kendall is survived by three \nbrothers, a sister, and their spouses: Kenneth and Charlotte Ivy, Kathy \nand Doug Shifley, Kevin and Michelle Ivy, and Keith and Becky Ivy. Lee \nAnn was 5 months pregnant with their son Gabriel at the time of \nKendall's death.\n  Kendall and Lee Ann first saw each other in middle school. Lee Ann \nsaid that after she met him, she spent the greatest 14 years of her \nlife. Kendall and Lee Ann got married young. Kendall once told her, \n``What if we wait and then die in our late twenties? We would miss out \non so much married life.'' Indeed, Kendall Ivy was a true family man. \nHe learned of Caleb's birth when he was pulled out of formation on the \nflight deck of an aircraft carrier. Kendall loved his two boys, but the \nbirth of his daughter changed his life, Lee Ann said. He was very much \na family man and was looking forward to coming home and spending time \nwith all of them.\n  Venita says that her son was ``destined to be a Marine.'' From the \nage of 3, he wanted to wear the gold eagle, globe, and anchor insignia \nof the Corps. He made that happen, becoming a staff sergeant while \nplanning a career in the Marines. He served in the United States Marine \nCorps for 10 years. Venita said her son told her he ``wanted to serve \nthis country, that we need to be over there in Iraq so they can be free \nlike we are.''\n  Kevin Ivy also remembers his younger brother's dream of becoming a \nmarine, saying:\n\n       He lived life to the fullest. He was kindhearted. He loved \n     his country. He loved his president. He believed in what he \n     was doing. Each and everyone of these fine young men and \n     women is in a dangerous situation. But my brother understood \n     that, and he was willing to lay down his life for the cause \n     of freeing these people.\n\n  Kendall Ivy was loved dearly not only by his family, but also by \nthose who had the privilege to serve with him. Marine CPT Dave Handy \nwrote the following statement on an Internet tribute site to Kendall:\n\n       I was then Staff Sergeant Ivy's platoon commander for a \n     short time and remember him leaving the Marine Corps to seek \n     new adventures. I was ecstatic to hear that such a fine \n     leader of Marines had rejoined the Corps and then brought to \n     tears to hear of his death. I remember him as a ruthless \n     enforcer of standards, a superb example for young Marines, \n     and a patient mentor for all around him. All officers should \n     have been so lucky as to serve with enlisted leaders of Staff \n     Sergeant Ivy's superior caliber. My thoughts and prayers are \n     with his family and I look forward to seeing him again on the \n     streets of heaven. Semper Fidelis.\n\n  On the same tribute site, Aric Wells of Nashville, TN, said:\n\n       To my friend. To his wife and children. I am deeply sorry. \n     To all who did not have the privilege of knowing Staff \n     Sergeant Ivy, let me tell you that we have lost a great man. \n     A man with morals and convictions that did not waver. A man \n     who would give the shirt off his back to help you out. Staff \n     Sergeant Ivy would go to bat for you when others would turn \n     their backs. He was a damn good man and always a Marine. I \n     will always remember him.\n\n  Indeed, Kendall Ivy was deeply loved by all those who knew him. At \nCamp Ripper, Iraq, a new gym was opened on August 1, 2005, named the \n``Staff Sergeant Kendall H. Ivy II Memorial Gym.'' His presence is felt \ndaily by those like SGT Johnny A. Noguera, the gym manager. Sergeant \nNoguera said:\n\n       Everyone wants to make this place as nice as possible, \n     especially for the Marines who knew Staff Sergeant Ivy. When \n     I was growing up in South America, one of my father's friends \n     had a son who was a Marine. He was so proud of him and he \n     seemed to have this aura around him. That's how Staff \n     Sergeant Ivy was and that's what I wanted to be. I know that \n     many people miss him and they look at this gym as a direct \n     reflection of their love for him. This is why I stress to the \n     guys who work here to keep this place in order so we can \n     properly pay homage to the man who it's named after.\n\n  The Marines who attended Kendall's funeral remembered going to the \ngym with him, then not being able to persuade him to leave. At the end \nof the workout, Kendall would then ask if his arms looked any bigger. \nLee Anna says that her husband ``was worse than a woman about his hair \nand weight.''\n  To end, I would like to quote Sergeant Downing, who wrote a few words \nabout Kendall on the Internet tribute site. He writes:\n\n       I served with Staff Sergeant Ivy in Weapons Company, 1st \n     Battalion, 6th Marines. Someone once said, `the best \n     compliment you can give is to say he was a good Marine.' \n     Well, Staff Sergeant Ivy was a damn good Marine!\n\n  Kendall Ivy epitomized not only the meaning of a good Marine, but \nalso of the ideal son, husband, and father. My wife Fran and I continue \nto keep the family and friends of SSG Kendall Ivy in our thoughts and \nprayers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The Senator from Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/27/senate-section/article/S6550-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6550-S6552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me start by acknowledging my gratitude \nand respect for the Senator from Ohio for coming to the floor of the \nSenate at this late hour and telling these touching stories about these \nmen and women who have served our Nation so well and have given their \nlives in service to our values and this great cause of making America \nsafe. As of today, 2,524 of those stories could be told. That is the \nnumber of American service men and women who have died in Iraq as of \ntoday.\n  It is a day of special significance in my State of Illinois. We have \nreached the number of 100, 100 brave men and women from the land of \nLincoln who have given their lives in service to our country, 100 \nIllinois families who have lost a loved one, a child, a parent, a \nspouse, a brother, a sister.\n  Abraham Lincoln, in the midst of the Civil War, consumed with grief \nover all of the death, said of those who died that they gave ``the last \nfull measure of devotion.'' It is a reminder to all of us that when we \ndiscuss policy in the Senate, it does not always have a direct impact \non the lives of those we represent. But when we vote on foreign policy, \non the issue of war, we are making decisions that cost lives. We should \nnever forget that. That is why this is more than just another job or \nanother profession. This is, indeed, an awesome responsibility.\n  Last week we completed the debate on where we will go in Iraq. It was \nnot\n\n[[Page S6551]]\n\nconclusive. Two amendments were offered and neither were adopted. \nBasically, the Senate took no position, at least the majority of the \nSenate took no position as the debate came to a close. But it was \ninteresting, the tone and tenor of that debate. How many times on the \nfloor of the Senate did we hear from the other side of the aisle the \nphrase ``cut and run''? It was part of a recurring mantra. I don't know \nhow genuine it was--I assume it was--or if it was generated by a focus \ngroup as just the right combination of words to criticize those who \nwould suggest we need a different approach and a different plan in \nIraq. But after all of the chest thumping and the ``bring them on'' \nrhetoric, the sad reality is that our debate ended and the war \ncontinues.\n  But then something very interesting happened. After we had considered \nan amendment offered by Senator Carl Levin and Senator Jack Reed which \nsuggested that we should start withdrawing troops this year, moving \ntoward a timetable, a day when our troops would come home, after that \namendment was defeated on basically a partisan rollcall--there might \nhave been one Republican joining us, but basically it was a partisan \nrollcall--after that amendment had been criticized as a cut-and-run, \nretreat amendment, something interesting occurred: The top U.S. \ncommander in Iraq, General Casey, announced shortly after the Levin-\nReed amendment was defeated that, in fact, we would redeploy as many as \nfive to six U.S. combat brigades by the end of this next year and that \nhe plans to begin drawing down forces in just a few weeks.\n  General Casey is offering a plan that in many ways looks very similar \nto the Democratic proposals. Yet when we proposed initiating \nredeployment this year, the Republican majority accused us of cutting \nand running from our responsibilities in Iraq. General Casey's plan \ndoes not call for total withdrawal, neither did the Democratic \nalternatives. Senators Levin and Reed wanted to begin redeployment this \nyear and continue without a specific time line for completion but \nclearly putting the burden on the Iraqis to defend themselves.\n  I also supported the Kerry-Feingold amendment calling for \nredeployment of the bulk of U.S. forces by July of next year, 12 months \naway. Some said 12 months is too soon; 12 months is not enough time.\n  What has happened in the last 12 months in Iraq? In the last 12 \nmonths we have lost 762 soldiers. We have seen more than 2,000 come \nhome with serious injuries. We have spent nearly $90 billion. It isn't \njust 12 months on the calendar. It is 12 months of living and dying and \nbeing injured and asking the American people to continue to sacrifice \nfor that war effort. So 12 months is an important and significant \nperiod of time.\n  The amendment by Senators Kerry and Feingold called for the continued \npresence of forces, if needed, beyond July of 2007, for training, \ncounterterrorism, and to protect U.S. personnel, along with a \nsubstantial U.S. military presence still in the region. They also \nsuggested we consult with the Iraqi Government about the future of our \ntroops.\n  It is interesting that these amendments and General Casey's plan \nshare several themes. First, we need a timeline for redeploying U.S. \nforces.\n  Second, redeployment does not mean total withdrawal.\n  Third, the shared objective of all plans is accelerating and \nexpanding the handover of leadership to the Iraqis themselves.\n  So many people criticized the Democrats at the end of last week that \nwe didn't take a position. It turns out the position we took in both \namendments was consistent by and large with the proposal of General \nCasey.\n  I believe this is less about setting deadlines than about \nestablishing timelines. We need to move toward a trajectory, a course \nof successfully handing over the security of Iraq to the people of \nIraq. We have given them so much.\n  This is the fourth year of this war. By the end of this calendar \nyear, it will have lasted longer than the Korean war and, a few months \nbeyond that, longer than World War II. We have given a lot: Over $300 \nbillion; over 2,500 American lives; 18,000 seriously injured soldiers; \n2,000 returning with head injuries that they will have to cope with for \nthe rest of their lives. This is the reality of war, and this is the \ncontribution given by the American people to the nation of Iraq to give \nthem a chance to depose a dictator, to allow free elections, to allow \nthem to debate and create a new government.\n\n  But in the end, we can't do it all, and we shouldn't do it all. There \nhas to be a will within the Iraqi people to stand up and defend \nthemselves. They have to understand that if their nation is worth \nhaving, it is worth fighting for. They have to resolve their internal \ndifficulties, and they have to stand together to fight off any \npotential enemies who would invade them in the future. That is the \nreality of real governance and real responsibility. That is why many of \nus believe that this debate ended last week without a conclusion. The \nmessage was not sent to the Iraqi people to accept the responsibility \nfor their fate. But General Casey's proposal at least moves in that \ndirection. I am glad those of us who voted last week for both the \nKerry-Feingold amendment and the Levin-Reed amendment are in concert \nwith General Casey in the belief that this must come to an end and \nsoon.\n  Then over the weekend something extraordinary happened. New Iraqi \nPrime Minister al-Maliki proposed a plan to try and unite Iraq's ethnic \nand sectarian factions. He knows the violence has taken a terrible \ntoll. Last week the Los Angeles Times released a study that said more \nthan 50,000 innocent Iraqis have died a violent death in the last 3 \nyears. The article suggested that maybe there were many more.\n  The statistics came from the Baghdad morgue, the Iraqi Health \nMinistry, and other sources. But for a variety of reasons, the death \ntoll is probably undercounted. Iraqis have died in uniform, killed by \ninsurgents. Others have died waiting in line at a market. Still more \nhave died along roadsides and in terrible, desperate places in the dark \nof night where they have been taken in by militias and murdered. The \nmajority of bodies at the morgue are those of civilians, and the vast \nmajority have been shot gangland-execution style. Many have been \nsavagely tortured.\n  In many cases, the cities of Iraq have been the battleground in \nstruggles between the U.S. and Iraqi Government forces against the \ninsurgents and foreign terrorists and among Iraqis themselves. \nCivilians have been caught in the crossfire, innocent people whose \nlives are in danger and extinguished in the crossfire of this \ninsurgency.\n  Recently a group of my constituents came to visit me. They knew of \npeople living in Ramadi, and they know there is an effort under way to \ntry to calm that area and to remove the insurgency. The people who came \nto see me in Springfield, IL are very concerned about the plight of \ninnocent people who were stuck in the middle of this crossfire. Ramadi \nis the largest predominantly Sunni city in Iraq. It is the capital of \nAnbar Province, one corner of the Sunni Triangle. Over 900 American \nservice men and women have been killed in that province. A corporal \nwith the First Armored Division was killed there on Monday.\n  Anbar has seen far too many deaths. U.S. and Iraqi forces are moving \nneighborhood by neighborhood trying to take control of the city. Many \ncivilians have fled but an unknown number remain.\n  Newspaper accounts describe ``a post-apocalyptic world: row after row \nof buildings shot up, boarded up, caved in, tumbled down.'' Our \ngenerals have repeatedly stated that there will not be another frontal \nFallujah-style assault of Ramadi. Our forces have encircled the city \nand are trying to retake it one neighborhood at a time. The goal is for \nIraqi forces to remain in the city, to allow it to return to some kind \nof normal economic life, and to keep the insurgents from simply \nretaking the neighborhoods.\n  Those are worthy goals, and it is critical to their success that the \ncivilians of Ramadi feel that they can stay and be safe in their city. \nUltimately, it is the Iraqi people and their leaders, their armed \nforces and police, who will have to end this cycle of violence.\n  Prime Minister al-Maliki is trying to find a way out. In looking at \nthe terrible waves of death in Iraq, though, it is the deaths of over \n2,500 American service men and women that touch my heart.\n\n[[Page S6552]]\n\n  As the Prime Minister searches for a way to end the insurgency, we \nhave to make it clear that his plans for reconciliation cannot rest on \nthe foundation of amnesty for those who killed our brave soldiers.\n  In his plan, the Prime Minister stated there might be amnesty for \ninsurgents ``not proved to be involved in crimes, terrorist activities, \nand war crimes against humanity.''\n  Now, the President has to make it clear to the Iraqi Government that \nthey cannot erase the killing of Americans as they try to sketch out \nthis reconciliation plan.\n  I asked on a weekend show--when I was on one of the Sunday morning \nshows--what would you think of a plan that said if you killed an \nAmerican soldier, you could be given amnesty? It would trouble me \ngreatly, when I think of those soldiers of ours who have died for the \npeople of Iraq. It would trouble me as much, if not more, if I had a \nson or daughter in uniform over there, realizing that they basically \nannounced that it is excusable to shoot and kill an American soldier. \nWe cannot allow that to happen.\n  The Iraqi Government faces a difficult road ahead. We have to \ncontinue to help them. We need to also step up the effort to make the \nIraqis responsible for their own future. Some have said we must stay \nand finish the job, but the simple fact is it is not our job to finish. \nIt is for the Iraqis to finish the job.\n  The Senate overwhelmingly called for 2006 to be a year of transition \nin Iraq. That transition must be to Iraqi leadership and \nresponsibility. That is how we can truly announce that our mission is \naccomplished.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/27/senate-section/article/S6552-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6552-S6553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HIGHER EDUCATION ACT EXTENSION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

I \nhave seen it time and time again, whether we are talking about a \ncommitment to help certain people, such as the disabled, or to cure a \ncertain disease, whether it is mental illness or cancer or heart \ndisease; you find that many of our colleagues in the Senate and the \nHouse really rise to the occasion and show great devotion and \ncommitment to these issues because they have seen them, they understand \nthem.\n  Well, we all come here with many life experiences. The one that I had \nas a young man was repeated many times over. After growing up in East \nSt. Louis, IL, and going for a year to a good university, St. Louis \nUniversity, I decided I had to go out of my home, go away to school. \nThat is what college was all about. I went home to my mom who was a \nwidow at the time, and told her of my plan.\n  She said: How could you afford it?\n  I said: Don't worry, I have it all under control.\n  Well, Mr. President, I was making it up. I had no idea how I was \ngoing to pay for it. I went to school here in Washington, at Georgetown \nUniversity, and worked hard during the school year and the summer and \nsaved up money to help pay expenses, and I also took out student loans.\n  Were it not for the National Defense Education Act, I could never \nhave finished college and law school. I didn't have any wealth, my \nfamily didn't either, so I had to borrow the money. It was early in the \n1960s and this program had just gotten started. There were kids all \nover America like myself who used those student loans to make it \nthrough college and professional school. I remember my wife and I were \nmarried when I was still in law school, and when I graduated they \naccumulated all of the student loans that I had borrowed in my entire \ncollege career and sent me this ominous letter to tell me that a year \nafter graduation I had to start paying it back, one-tenth of all those \nloans plus 3 percent every year, without fail. I opened that envelope \nwith great trepidation and saw that total amount and didn't know how I \ncould possibly do it. I told my new wife, holding our new baby, that we \nfaced a student loan debt that needed to be paid off over 10 years, and \nthat debt was $6,500.\n  Every time I tell that story to college students now, they break out \nlaughing at hearing $6,500. Now many of them have to borrow that for a \nsemester. Many years ago, it seemed like a daunting task. Luckily, we \nmet the challenge and paid off the loan. I have been watching student \nloans ever since because I understand for many students today they are \nstill the ticket to an education.\n  Last Friday, the Higher Education Act was extended for the fourth \ntime since last year.\n  I hope that by extending it 3 more months we will be able to work on \nmeaningful legislation that will make it easier for students and \nparents to pay for a college education.\n  Earlier this year, Members on the Republican side of the aisle passed \na so-called deficit reduction bill that cut $12 billion from student \naid--the largest single cut in financial aid programs in the history of \nthe country.\n  Although most of the $12 billion came from reducing the maximum yield \nprivate lenders could earn on loans, it also came from raising the \ninterest rates on many of the loans parents take out for their kids' \neducation.\n\n  Right now, students are scrambling to consolidate their loans in \norder to lock in a low interest rate. Do you know why? July 1 is the \ndeadline. Beginning then, students who are still in school will no \nlonger be able to consolidate their loans at lower interest rates \nbecause of changes made in the deficit reduction bill. The low interest \nrates, incidentally, will be gone.\n  We had an opportunity, with that change, to make a real investment in \nour children's future. Knowing that interest rates on student loans \nwere about to jump from 5.3 percent to 6.8 percent for students, and \nfrom 6.1 percent to 8.5 percent for most parent borrowers, we could \nhave made a real impact and taken the savings from the Deficit \nReduction Act on student loans--$12 billion--and helped the students \nand their parents. Would that not have been a wise investment in our \nfuture? If we are not going to help students finish their college \neducation to become the leaders of tomorrow, are we really preparing \nfor our future?\n  Sadly, the Republican majority took the $12 billion in savings from \nthe college student loan program--money taken out of the program--and \ninstead of giving it back to the students to help them get through \nschool, they put the money in a fund to help pay for tax cuts for the \nwealthiest people in America. That is the most upside down logic in the \nworld--to turn our backs on our young people who are struggling to pay \noff student loans for education and to say instead that the \nmultimillionaires will receive a more generous tax break. That is what \nthe leadership in Congress believes to be the highest priority. Not \nmany families in America agree.\n  The smart, hard-working students deserve a chance to get some help. \nBut the Republican majority let them down.\n  In April, I introduced a bill called the Reverse the Raid on Student \nAid Act of 2006, to change that. The bill would increase the Pell grant \nand turn it into a mandatory spending program, with automatic annual \nincreases; cut student and parent loan interest rates by 50 percent; \nand allow students to consolidate their loans while they are still in \nschool. It would take the money given to the wealthiest in tax cuts and \ngive it back to the students, to make college more affordable and to \nmake the debts they face after graduation more manageable.\n  The maximum Pell grant award has been frozen at $4,050 for 4 years. \nThe President, once again this year, proposed keeping the award at the \nsame level, $4,050, even though the total cost for tuition, fees, room \nand board at 4-year public universities has increased by 44 percent \nsince President George W. Bush came to office. As the cost of college \neducation has increased 44 percent, he has frozen the grants--Pell \ngrants--for those kids from struggling families who are trying to get a \ncollege education, which means they either postpone their education, \ngive up on their education, or borrow more money in student loans. Is \nthat any gift to America? Is that looking forward?\n  Twenty years ago, the maximum Pell grant for low-income and working \nfamilies covered about half--55 percent--of the average cost of \nattending a 4-year public college. Today, it is down to 33 percent. \nThat is more and more debt on students and their families.\n\n[[Page S6553]]\n\n  My bill would cut the scheduled interest rate increase. The average \nstudent debt of $17,500 has increased by more than 50 percent over the \nlast 10 years. When students decide to take out a student loan, they \nare making a decision that can affect their lives for years and years \nbeyond graduation. In some cases, a loan payment may be as high, or \nhigher, than the amount they pay for rent or to buy a car.\n  Large debt burdens can keep graduates from entering fields they \nreally want to enter and force them to go for the biggest paycheck.\n  A public interest research group recently said that more than a third \nof borrowers who graduate from private, 4-year colleges would face an \n``unmanageable'' debt on a starting teacher's salary, meaning they \nwould need to set aside more than 8 percent of their pay to cover the \nstudent loans, diminishing the likelihood that they would become a \nteacher. Other significant life choices, such as buying a home or a car \nor starting a family or even a marriage may be delayed because of high \nstudent loan payments that are made worse by the policies of this \nadministration and this Republican Congress.\n  My Reverse the Raid on Student Aid bill reflects the type of serious \ninvestment I believe we have to make to ensure the future success of \nour young generation.\n  Students who are qualified to go to college, students who want to go \nto college, students who can make valuable economic intellectual and \ncultural contributions to America by pursuing higher education should \nnot be kept away from school because they don't have the money. These \nstudents have our future.\n  If we want to move ahead in a global economy, we are not going to do \nit by importing talent from overseas. We have home-grown talent in \nAmerica. This is a land of opportunity so long as we create the \nopportunity in schools across America, including our colleges and \nuniversities.\n  The policies on student loans pushed by this Bush-Cheney \nadministration go in the wrong direction. An investment in our kids' \neducation--and this is an old cliche, but it is true--is an investment \nin our future. The best thing we can do is make sure higher education \nis accessible, and whenever the higher education reauthorization bill \nis considered by the full Senate, I hope we will have an opportunity to \ndebate what happened to student financial aid.\n  Lots of Members of Congress are going to hear from these students and \nparents when they realize after July 1 what has been done to them. We \ncannot continue to place the burden of paying for tax cuts on the backs \nof students and their families. It is not fair to them, nor is it the \nright thing to do for the future of our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/27/senate-section/article/S6553-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6553-S6554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ASBESTOS REFORM\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have 5 minutes allotted to me. I spoke \nyesterday extensively on the pending legislation, and I will use my 5 \nminutes on another subject.\n  The subject relates to an article in the Hill newspaper today, which \nis captioned, ``Holtz-Eakin Delivers Blow on Asbestos.''\n  Dr. Holtz-Eakin had been Director of the Congressional Budget Office \nand had testified at an earlier hearing on asbestos reform that the \ncost of the program would be between $120 billion and $150 billion, \nwhich was within range of the $140 billion allocated to the trust fund. \nBut Dr. Holtz-Eakin later went to work for a foundation that was funded \nwith $5 million by AIG Insurance Company and other insurers, where they \nhad a vested interest in trying to defeat the bill.\n  I have today written to the Hill and want to make these comments for \nall of my colleagues to hear. They can be most succinctly handled by my \nreading the letter that I am sending. It goes to the editor of the \nHill:\n\n       Dear Editor:\n       Your June 27 article ``Holtz-Eakin Delivers Blow on \n     Asbestos'' would have been more accurately captioned, \n     ``Holtz-Eakin Tries to Change his Testimony after Being Hired \n     and Paid by the Bill's Opponents.''\n       The fact is, as the notes of testimony disclose, Dr. Holtz-\n     Eakin did not change his testimony when he said:\n       ``The first statement, when I was Director of CBO, remains \n     true today.''\n       In an earlier statement, which he submitted when he was \n     Director of CBO, he said:\n       ``CBO expects the value of valid claims likely to be \n     submitted to the fund over the next 50 years can be between \n     $120 billion and $150 billion.''\n       That conclusion puts the cost within the reasonable \n     parameters of the $140 billion trust fund.\n       Dr. Holtz-Eakin made an unsuccessful effort to say that the \n     trust fund would not be terminated, as provided for in the \n     legislation, if the trust fund ran out of money. Dr. Holtz-\n     Eakin conceded:\n       ``The administrator will have the option to terminate the \n     fund. . . .''\n       Then Dr. Holtz-Eakin speculated:\n       ``It is my judgment and my judgment alone that in the \n     future Congress would continue this program. . . .'' That \n     would obviously require a changed congressional decision \n     since the bill stipulates the fund would be terminated if it \n     ran out of money. It is only Dr. Holtz-Eakin's speculation \n     that the program would be continued and then spend more \n     money.\n       The Hill article correctly noted that Dr. Holtz-Eakin's \n     effort to change his testimony arose because he:\n       ``became the head of a think tank funded by a foundation \n     set up by one of the biggest opponents of asbestos reform \n     bill, American International Group, an insurance giant better \n     known by its acronym AIG.''\n       The Hill article then noted that Dr. Holtz-Eakin was \n     invited to the Judiciary Committee hearing by the opponents \n     of the bill and that the ``Coalition for Asbestos Reform,'' \n     an organization funded by major insurance companies opposed \n     to the bill, issued a press release on the day of his \n     testimony claiming he was validating the Coalition's \n     criticism. Obviously, it was pre-arranged between Dr. Holtz-\n     Eakin and the Coalition since the Coalition had information \n     in advance and was prepared to make the announcement in a \n     press release the day of his testimony.\n       Anyone, including the Coalition, can raise any objections \n     they wish, but they ought to disclose the basis for Dr. \n     Holtz-Eakin's effort to defeat the legislation because he, as \n     The Hill pointed out, ``became the head of a think tank \n     funded by the insurance company opponents of the bill.''\n       Dr. Holtz-Eakin's bias and conflict of interest renders his \n     later testimony meaningless. It all shows how desperate the \n     ``Coalition for Asbestos Reform'' is and how the Coalition is \n     grasping at straws and buying testimony to try to defeat this \n     important reform legislation.\n\n  And then I signed the letter.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Hill article and the relevant points \nfrom the transcript be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From the Hill, June 27, 2006]\n\n                 Holtz-Eakin Delivers Blow on Asbestos\n\n                         (By Alexander Bolton)\n\n       Douglas Holtz-Eakin delivered a significant blow against \n     the effort to revive asbestos-reform legislation when he \n     testified earlier this month that a cost assessment of the \n     measure he had provided in November as director of the \n     Congressional Budget Office (CBO) was unrealistic.\n       Some say that the testimony was a surprising reversal, but \n     others note that since leaving the CBO Holtz-Eakin has taken \n     a position created by a $5 million grant from a source \n     adamantly opposed to the controversial legislation.\n       Holtz-Eakin is highly regarded on Capitol Hill, attracting \n     praise from both sides of the aisle. But the funding of his \n     organization has raised some conflict-of-interest concerns \n     about his views on the pending asbestos-reform bill.\n       Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) \n     is pushing to bring the bill to the floor for a vote, but \n     Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) has said he will \n     not do so unless it clearly has enough support to pass. A \n     previous effort by Frist to pass the legislation fell a few \n     votes short this year.\n       As CBO director, Holtz-Eakin testified to the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee that a trust fund that would be set up by \n     the bill to pay asbestos-related medical claims would have \n     little effect on the federal budget.\n       But when he appeared again before the committee seven \n     months later, Holtz-Eakin compared the trust fund to three of \n     the largest mandatory government programs, Social Security, \n     Medicare and Medicaid, and declared that now is ``a \n     particularly bad time'' to start such a new program.\n       Critics of the Specter legislation have criticized it as a \n     costly program that could significantly add to the deficit \n     years down the road.\n       At the beginning of this year, Holtz-Eakin became the head \n     of a think tank funded by a foundation set up by one of the \n     biggest opponents of the asbestos-reform bill, American \n     International Group, an insurance giant better known by its \n     acronym AIG.\n       AIG is one of several entities that have poured tens if not \n     hundreds of thousands of dollars into an effort to defeat the \n     asbestos reform bill, according to internal industry \n     documents.\n       AIG also created the charity organization that endowed a \n     think tank, the Maurice R.\n\n[[Page S6554]]\n\n     Greenberg Center for Geoeconomic Studies, named after AIG's \n     longtime chairman, that Holtz-Eakin now heads.\n       Holtz-Eakin has become a pivotal player in the behind-the-\n     scenes battle to bring asbestos reform back to the Senate \n     floor because of his residual authority as Congress's former \n     chief accountant. Holtz-Eakin's damaging testimony on the \n     asbestos bill was widely reported.\n       And the Coalition for Asbestos Reform, an alliance of \n     corporations that oppose Specter's asbestos-reform bill that \n     is lobbying senators on the issue, has pounced on Holtz-\n     Eakin's words as support for their position.\n       ``The testimony of former Congressional Budget Office \n     Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin validates the criticism that the \n     Coalition for Asbestos Reform has made for many months about \n     a federal trust-fund approach to the asbestos litigation \n     situation,'' the coalition announced in a press release the \n     day of the testimony.\n       Specter said at the hearing that there was ``a 180-degree \n     difference'' between what Holtz-Eakin estimated the program \n     would cost as CBO director and his subsequent comment that \n     its cost was highly uncertain. The first time Holtz-Eakin \n     testified it was at Specter's invitation as CBO chief. The \n     second time he was invited by an opponent of the bill, though \n     it is unclear which member sought his testimony.\n       The coalition, which is funded in part by AIG, identified \n     Holtz-Eakin as an important figure in a planning document it \n     drafted in December. The document quoted Holtz-Eakin's \n     testimony the previous month on the trust fund and suggested \n     portions that could be used to undermine the bill by \n     questioning the accuracy of CBO's cost estimates and \n     bolstering the credence of much-higher-cost projections.\n       The planning document also identified AIG as one of the \n     nine biggest funders of the Coalition for Asbestos Reform, \n     along with other major insurance firms: Allstate, Hartford \n     Insurance, Liberty Mutual and Nationwide Insurance.\n       AIG's founder has also provided the bulk of the funding for \n     the geoeconomic-studies center that Holtz-Eakin now heads. \n     The center was endowed with a $5 million grant from the Starr \n     Foundation in 2000, according to the publicly available 990 \n     form that the foundation submitted to the Internal Revenue \n     Service.\n       The foundation, in turn, was established by AIG's founder, \n     Cornelius Vander Starr. It earned nearly $50 million by \n     selling 470,000 shares of AIG in 2000, according to the tax \n     form.\n       Ken Frydman, foundation spokesman, said the group had no \n     role in hiring Holtz-Eakin to head the Greenberg Center.\n       Specter asked Holtz-Eakin at this month's hearing if the \n     difference between his earlier and later testimonies was \n     ``attributable to [his] position working for the Greenberg \n     Center.'' But Specter did not discuss the sums of money \n     involved, and news accounts of the hearing did not report \n     Specter's concern.\n       ``I receive no funds from AIG, and my views today are my \n     own,'' Holtz-Eakin replied. The former CBO chief said that he \n     is merely director of the Greenberg Center and that he is \n     ``funded by the Council on Foreign Relations.'' ``And my \n     funding is from the Paul Volcker Chair in International \n     Economics,'' he added.\n       The council, too, has received substantial funding from the \n     Starr Foundation. The council has received $27 million in \n     grants from the foundation since 1960, said Anya Schmemann, \n     the Council on Foreign Relations' spokeswoman.\n       Holtz-Eakin defended his conflicting testimony in a recent \n     interview. He said that as CBO director his job was to put a \n     price tag on legislation, not to give his opinion of bills. \n     He also said that his recent assessment questioning the \n     certainty of the CBO's cost estimates was a personal opinion, \n     something he was not allowed to give as CBO director.\n       ``CBO doesn't take positions; it prices bills,'' he said. \n     ``My personal opinion is that you can't take this bill at \n     face value. I think a future Congress will change it.''\n       Holtz-Eakin said he was required as head of the CBO to take \n     the asbestos-reform bill at face value and assume that the \n     program would sunset when it ran out of money, thereby \n     sparing taxpayers its cost. But as a private citizen, Holtz-\n     Eakin said he is now free to express his opinion that that \n     scenario is unlikely because Congress would rather pay to \n     keep it afloat then let it close.\n       ``These are my views,'' he said. ``I didn't know that \n     Maurice Greenberg had an opinion on the bill.''\n                                  ____\n\n       The Chairman. We now go to the five-minute rounds by \n     members.\n       Let me begin with you, Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I am a little \n     surprised by the difference in your testimony today from the \n     materials submitted by you when you were Director of the \n     Congressional Budget Office.\n       The statement which you submitted as head of CBO said, \n     ``CBO expects the value of valid claims likely to be \n     submitted to the fund over the next 50 years can be between \n     $120 billion and $150 billion.''\n       In the written statement which you submitted for today's \n     hearing, you say, ``Both the scale of the mandatory spending \n     and the size of the revenues are highly uncertain.''\n       There is a 180-degree difference between what you and now \n     attributable to your position working for the Greenberg \n     Center, and in effect, AIG?\n       Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Let me do those in reverse order. First, I \n     am the director of that center. I am funded by the Council on \n     Foreign Relations. My funding is from the Paul Volcker Chair \n     in International Economics. I receive no funds from AIG, and \n     my views today are my own.\n       The Chairman. Well, let us take up your own views, if you \n     are not influenced by these other factors. How do you account \n     for the statement that you make here that there is mandatory \n     spending, and how do you account for the fact that you say \n     ``a future Congress and administration are guaranteed to turn \n     to the taxpayer. How can you say that?\n       Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Let me explain. The first statement, when \n     I was Director of CBO, remains true today. It is the case \n     that this will be mandatory spending in the Federal budget. \n     It will not be subject to appropriation. It will fit every \n     common-sense definition of mandatory spending.\n       The Chairman. It is mandatory until it runs out, Dr. Holtz-\n     Eakin.\n       Dr. Holtz-Eakin. It will be the case that the legislation \n     provides for a sunset--that is what I said, . . . and that \n     remains true today--automatic, or at the discretion of the \n     administrator, depending on the eyes of the----\n       The Chairman. Well, is there mandatory spending after the \n     fund runs out?\n       Dr. Holtz-Eakin. There is a program in place that requires \n     money to be spent.\n       The Chairman. Wait a minute. Does it require----\n       Dr. Holtz-Eakin. My judgment----\n       The Chairman. Wait a minute. Does it require the money to \n     be spent or does it require Congress to act? Now, you say in \n     your oral testimony here, ``there will be political pressure \n     to spend'' and you challenge the Congress on any fiscal \n     restraint.\n       How can you say what a Congress in the future will do? \n     Congress will not be obligated to spend the money once the \n     $140 billion is gone, will it?\n       Dr. Holtz-Eakin. The administrator will have the option to \n     terminate the fund, is my reading of it. We can debate \n     whether you think that is correct reading. It is my judgment, \n     and my judgment alone, that in the future Congress would \n     continue this program and an administrator would have an \n     enormous technical difficulty in sunsetting it at the \n     appropriate time. It would be very hard to * * *\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/27/senate-section/article/S6554-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6554-S6555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  100TH ANNIVERSARY OF MINDEN, NEVADA\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate a historic and \nimportant event in Nevada. On July 2, 2006, the town of Minden will \ncelebrate its 100th anniversary.\n  Located in the scenic Carson Valley, Minden is known for its beauty. \nThe Carson Valley Mountain Range provides an imposing, but beautiful, \nbackground for the small community of 7,500. Minden is widely known for \nits small town charm because the town was mapped and planned before a \nsingle brick was laid. Visitors and residents of Minden can see the \nplanning even today in the neatly laid streets and buildings. Minden \nretains its turn-of-the-century feel, and most of the original \narchitecture is still evident in the town.\n  Like other communities in the Carson Valley, Minden was founded as a \nresult of the railroad. In 1905, the Virginia and Truckee Railroad \nexplored possible locations to expand their rail line. Heinrick \nFrederick Dangberg, offered to donate land from the H.F. Dangberg Land \nand Livestock Company for the expansion. The railroad accepted his \noffer, and Dangberg submitted a plan for the new town to the Douglas \nCounty Commissioners in 1906. In choosing a name for the new town, \nDangberg honored his birthplace near Minden, Germany.\n  The Virginia and Truckee Railroad carried gold and silver from the \nfamed Comstock Load in Virginia City, NV. But by the time of their \nproposed expansion in 1905, the railroad began to look for new sources \nof revenue. They found a lucrative revenue source in transporting \nlivestock, and the new branch of the railroad that ran through Minden \nbecame the main shipping route for livestock going from San Francisco \nto Chicago.\n  With the railroad and other businesses in the town, Minden and the \nneighboring community of Gardnerville became the center of commerce for \nthe Carson Valley. In 1915, there was a growing sentiment to move the \ncourthouse from Genoa to a more populated area. More than 150 people \nfrom the Carson Valley traveled to the state capital to see the Nevada \nSenate vote to move the county seat to Minden. With the completion of a \nnew courthouse in 1916, Minden replaced Genoa as the county seat of \nDouglas County.\n  In 1925, one of the most famous Minden residents, David Derek\n\n[[Page S6555]]\n\nStacton, was born. Over the course of his life, Stacton won wide \nacclaim as an author and a poet. He was honored as a Guggenheim fellow \nin 1960 and 1966. Although he passed away at the early age of 41, \nStacton left us many critically acclaimed histories on subjects from \nNapoleon to Nefertiti.\n  By 1950, the Virginia and Truckee Railroad was struggling, and the \noperation was closed down. For a town that grew out of the end of the \nrailroad line, this loss was a big change for the community. The people \nof Minden met this challenge, and other industries soon came to Minden, \nmany of them high-tech firms from California. Among those companies was \nBently Industries, the maker of vibration monitoring equipment. Today, \na steady wave of high-tech companies continues to relocate to Minden \nand Douglas County.\n  This small town--which got its first traffic light in 1985--has \nmanaged to move itself into the 21st century, without losing its \nhistoric charm. Every June, thousands of Nevadans travel from all over \nto take part in the Carson Valley Days. Cohosted by Minden and \nGardnerville, Carson Valley Days is an annual event with a parade, \ncarnival, live music, truck pull, and arts and crafts. This historic \nevent was started in 1910 by H.F. Dangberg, and it is now in its 96th \nyear.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to have a town like Minden in my home \nState, and I congratulate the people of Minden on their 100th \nanniversary. I encourage all my colleagues in the Senate and all the \npeople of this great country to experience this beautiful and historic \npart of Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/27/senate-section/article/S6555-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SALUTING EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the first ever USA Special Olympics \nNational Games will open this Saturday in Ames, IA. Looking ahead to \nthis remarkable gathering of athletes, coaches, and family members from \nall across America, I want to salute the vision and leadership of \nEunice Kennedy Shriver, the founder and honorary chair of Special \nOlympics International.\n  No individual in the world is more respected and admired for her \ntireless advocacy on behalf of people with intellectual disabilities. \nFor four decades, Eunice has pursued this advocacy with her trademark \npassion and tenacity. As executive director of the Joseph P. Kennedy, \nJr. Foundation, she has been instrumental in establishing the National \nInstitute for Child Health and Human Development, as well as a network \nof mental retardation research centers at major medical schools across \nthe United States.\n  In 1968, she established her most enduring legacy, the Special \nOlympics. Starting in Eunice's own backyard as a day camp for children \nwith mental retardation, it has grown into a global movement that \nserves more than 2.2 million adults and children with intellectual \ndisabilities in more than 150 countries.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, will the Senator from Iowa yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would be happy to yield to the distinguished senior \nSenator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, as the Senator from Iowa knows, I am a \nlongtime supporter of the Special Olympics, and a longtime friend and \nadmirer of Eunice Kennedy Shriver and her work. This remarkable \nAmerican is a fine example of President Reagan's observation that you \ndon't have to be on the public payroll in order to be an outstanding \npublic servant.\n  Anchorage, AK, was proud to host the 2001 Special Olympics Winter \nGames, which was the largest sporting event ever held in Alaska. In \nconjunction with that Special Olympics event, I chaired a Committee on \nAppropriations field hearing on promoting the health of individuals \nwith intellectual disabilities. This was the first hearing of its kind \ndevoted exclusively to the needs of people with intellectual \ndisabilities.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am well aware of that historic hearing. \nThis Saturday in Ames, I will chair a field hearing of the Labor/HHS/\nEducation Appropriations Subcommittee, which will essentially be a \nfollowup and update on the Senator's hearing in Anchorage 5 years ago.\n  And let me just echo the Senator's observation that Eunice Kennedy \nShriver, in a voluntary capacity, has been one of America's great \npublic servants. Public officials in Washington have the persuasion of \npower, but the gentlewoman from Massachusetts has the power of \npersuasion. She has used that power brilliantly to advance the well \nbeing of people with intellectual disabilities all across the world. \nAnd I share with the Senator from Alaska and all of our colleagues in \nthe Senate a deep respect and appreciation for Eunice Kennedy Shriver's \nlifetime of service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/27/senate-section/article/S6555-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6555-S6556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to laud the Senate's unanimous \napproval of a $517.6 billion blueprint for the Nation's Armed Forces \nthat expresses Congress's support for the necessary tools for our \nmilitary fighting throughout the world.\n  It is critical that our military invest more resources for training, \nweapons, and technology to meet the new demands placed on it by the war \non terror. We need to keep investing in our defense programs that have \nworked well in the past. We must also make sure that we provide enough \nresources for research and development, which will ensure that our \nservicemen and servicewomen are equipped with the best weapons \npossible. I wish to express my pride in the many Connecticut defense \ncompanies and skilled workers that meet both of these critical demands. \nLast year, I successfully fought efforts to close Submarine Base New \nLondon, because closing the base would have been a threat to our \nnational security and would have put the most skilled defense workers \nin the world out of work. These irreplaceable workers are key to \npromoting our national security and developing important innovations \nthat will help protect the lives of our military personnel.\n  I would like to highlight several provisions of the bill that I \nbelieve merit emphasis. Particularly important are additions to \nsubmarine design programs and construction at U.S. Submarine Base New \nLondon. They provide $75 million in additional funding for submarine \ndesign, $65 million for improvements to the Virginia class submarine \nand $10 million to begin design for the replacement of the nation's \nOhio class ballistic missile submarine. This addition will help \nsubmarine designers at Electric Boat in my home State of Connecticut. \nThe inclusion of $9.6 million for a small craft maintenance facility is \nalso a critical step in upgrading the submarine base.\n  I am particularly heartened by the adoption of an amendment I worked \non with Senators Boxer, Kennedy, and Clinton to ensure that our \nsoldiers receive the mental health care they need and deserve. The \namendment creates a detailed and comprehensive screening process to \nassess the mental health status of individual soldiers before they are \ndeployed to combat zones and ensures that a soldier who is determined \nto have symptoms of a mental health condition will be referred to an \nappropriate qualified mental health care professional for further \nevaluation. It also mandates timely access to mental health services if \nrequested by a member of the armed forces before, during, or after \ndeployment to a combat zone--within 72 hours after making the request \nor as soon as possible and requires consent from a qualified mental \nhealth care professional before a soldier deemed to have a duty-\nlimiting mental health condition is sent to a combat zone.\n  We introduced this amendment to protect the health and safety of \nservicemembers and their units--similar to the ones The Hartford \nCourant has written about. The military mental health amendment has two \npurposes. First, it is meant to keep these courageous young men and \nwomen out of the way of any further harm. Second, we must make certain \nthat our units have the strongest and healthiest soldiers and this \namendment moves us in the right direction.\n  I also cosponsored an amendment that enables the Air Force to enter \ninto a multiyear contract beginning in fiscal year 2007 for 60 F-22 \naircraft over 3 years. Moving to multiyear contract will save American \ntaxpayers more than $250 million.\n  To ensure military families do not have to face the burdens of rising \npharmaceutical copays for TRICARE next\n\n[[Page S6556]]\n\nyear, I cosponsored an amendment with Senators Lautenberg and Stabenow \nthat prohibits increasing retail pharmacy copays for TRICARE \nbeneficiaries through fiscal year 2007. The President's budget \nsubmission proposed raising generic and brand name copays from $3 and \n$9 to $5 and $15, respectively. That type of increase is simply not an \nacceptable solution. Our amendment ensures that we keep prescriptions \naffordable for those individuals who selflessly serve in our Nation's \nmilitary.\n  Finally, I cosponsored an amendment introduced by Senator Cantwell \nthat will help elucidate the link between troop exposure to depleted \nuranium during combat and gulf war syndrome. This amendment requires a \njoint comprehensive study of troop depleted uranium exposure by the \nDefense Department, Veterans Affairs, and Health and Human Services. We \nneed to better understand the relationship between depleted uranium \nexposure and adverse health effects, and I believe this amendment will \nhelp us achieve this goal.\n  I thank both Senators Levin and Warner for incorporating these \namendments and funding priorities into the Defense authorization bill \nfor 2007. I encourage the conferees in both the House and Senate to \nkeep these provisions in the final version of the legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/27/senate-section/article/S6556-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IMPROVING HOSPITAL CARE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have said it before and I will say it \nagain--the quality of health care in America is in critical condition. \nForty-six million Americans lack health insurance. That is over 10 \npercent of the people in this country.\n  It is time to focus on revising our health care system to meet the \nneeds of patients by extending coverage and raising the standard of \ncare. Incremental steps can make a difference. A recent op-ed article \nin the Boston Globe by Cleve Killingsworth, president and CEO of Blue \nCross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, highlights an informative \nnationwide study by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement of \nCambridge, MA, in which 3,000 acute-care hospitals across the country \nwere asked to follow specific practical guidelines proven to save \npatients' lives. The study, conducted over 18 months, showed that over \n122,000 lives had been saved when hospitals implemented just a series \nof basic safety precautions to improve patient care.\n  Blue Cross Blue Shield has worked effectively to improve health care \nin Massachusetts, and I commend Mr. Killingsworth for his impressive \nleadership and for bringing this important study to our attention.\n  I believe that my colleagues will be especially interested in these \npractical steps to improve the quality of hospital care and their life-\nsaving potential, and I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Killingsworth's \nimportant article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, June 21, 2006]\n\n                     Leading the Way on Healthcare\n\n                      (By Cleve L. Killingsworth)\n\n       Improving the quality healthcare saves lives. That's the \n     lesson behind last week's announcement by the Institute for \n     Healthcare Improvement that more than 120,000 such lives were \n     saved nationally because hospitals followed proven \n     interventions that deliver safer and more effective care.\n       All 72 Massachusetts acute care hospitals participated in \n     this campaign. Their success together with the state's \n     landmark healthcare reform law that will focus on many of the \n     best practices used by the institute through the \n     Massachusetts Health Care Quality and Cost Council puts the \n     state in a unique position to lead the country in delivering \n     top-quality health services.\n       Don Berwick, president of the Cambridge-based institute, \n     explained that, over the past 18 months, a national effort by \n     3,000 hospitals across the country prevented the unnecessary \n     deaths of more than 122,300 patients.\n       The effort supports interventions that make a real \n     difference for patients. In many cases, that just means \n     getting hospitals and front-line health workers to agree to \n     follow practices that have been shown to eliminate error and \n     save lives.\n       Some policies and procedures that the institute and the \n     participating hospitals have put in place are relatively \n     simple. For example, they are committed to giving patients \n     who are at risk for heart attacks aspirin and beta-blockers. \n     They are making sure that patients on ventilators have their \n     heads raised between 30 to 45 degrees at all times to prevent \n     them from developing pneumonia. They are implementing rapid-\n     response teams at the first sign that a patient's condition \n     is worsening. And they are making sure that doctors and \n     nurses working with patients who are receiving medicines and \n     fluids from central lines clean the patients' skin with a \n     certain type of antiseptic.\n       While these procedures are not revolutionary in concept, \n     they require significant collaborative effort and commitment. \n     Taken together, these everyday actions can represent a sea \n     change in patient outcomes for hospitals. Because of the \n     size, diversity, and complexity of the healthcare system with \n     all its insurers, providers, caregivers, and facilities it is \n     difficult to disseminate best practices that improve patient \n     health. And yet the success that the institute has fostered \n     shows that it can be done.\n       It is fitting that every acute-care facility in the state \n     is participating in this process. Massachusetts has already \n     shown it can lead the nation in achieving better healthcare. \n     Passing the legislation that made universal access to \n     healthcare the standard wasn't easy. It took bringing \n     together political leaders from all sides, business leaders, \n     consumer and patient groups, insurers, hospitals, doctors, \n     and nurses.\n       And there is more that can and must be done. The state \n     Health Care Quality and Cost Council, established by the \n     landmark legislation, can further improve the delivery of \n     medical care and do so in a way that restrains the growth in \n     spending. The success of the institute's effort shows what \n     can be accomplished when all insurers and hospitals \n     collaboratively choose concrete goals that improve the safety \n     and effectiveness of care.\n       Massachusetts has the best healthcare system in the country \n     but it can get better. Given the high caliber of the \n     hospitals and medical schools, the commitment of doctors and \n     nurses, and the pioneering spirit of organizations such as \n     the institute and others that are willing to point out where \n     the system is failing and fix it, Massachusetts is in a \n     unique position to fundamentally transform it.\n       The institute has shown that improving the system will save \n     lives. And so with the wind of reform at our backs, universal \n     health coverage within reach, and progress not only possible \n     but demonstrable, now is the time to commit to making \n     Massachusetts the standard bearer for quality healthcare for \n     all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/27/senate-section/article/S6556-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6556-S6557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RURAL VETERANS CARE ACT\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a critical issue \nfacing thousands of Americans. Many of my colleagues have heard me talk \nabout the importance of rural America. As I have said before, in many \nways, the very fabric of rural America is fraying, thread by thread. \nThe America where I grew up--the America of farmers, ranchers, small \nbusiness owners, and generations of close-knit families--is slowly \nslipping away. And the Federal Government is simply not doing enough to \nreverse this troubling trend. This America--rural America--has sadly \nbecome the ``Forgotten America.''\n  As we approach the Fourth of July recess, I want to talk about the \nchallenges facing a community within the Forgotten America: rural \nveterans. In rural communities across the country, men and women have \ndevoted themselves to the cause of freedom without hesitation and in \nnumbers greatly beyond their proportion to the U.S. population. Yet we \nconsistently overlook the unique challenges these men and women face \nafter they return home to their families and friends in the heartland \nof America. When it comes to the VA health care system, we fail our \nNation's rural veterans by not doing more to ensure they can access the \nhigh-quality health care they have earned. We owe them much better.\n  Over and over, I hear from veterans in my State about obstacles to \ncare. I recently met with a veteran from northeast Colorado who told me \nhe had to travel 500 miles roundtrip just to get a simple blood test at \na VA hospital. I think most of my colleagues would agree with me that \nthis is ludicrous.\n  I wish I could say this represents an isolated incident. \nUnfortunately, it does not. Because of gaps in the network of VA \nhospitals and clinics, and because the VA health care system is not \nequipped to fill these gaps, we hear stories like this all the time.\n  Every day, veterans from rural communities throughout the country are \nforced to put off crucial treatment because they live too far from VA \nfacilities and can't get the care they need. As a result, rural \nveterans die younger and suffer from more debilitating illnesses--all \nbecause our system is not equipped to address their needs and provide \ncare accordingly. A 2004 study\n\n[[Page S6557]]\n\nof over 750,000 veterans conducted by Dr. Jonathan Perlin, the Under \nSecretary for Health at the VA, consistently found that veterans living \nin rural areas are in poorer health than their urban counterparts. \nStill, despite the fact that 23 percent of the Nation's veterans live \nin rural areas, the VA does not have a high-level office responsible \nfor coordinating care to this vital constituency.\n  This is simply unacceptable. We need policies that address the plight \nof our rural veterans, and we need them now.\n  With that objective in mind, Senator Thune and I recently introduced \nlegislation that would significantly enhance our approach to rural \nveterans' health care. Thanks to the support of the 12 cosponsors of \nthis legislation and to the bipartisan efforts of my colleagues on the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee who worked to ensure its fair, insightful, \nand constructive review, we were able to include many of this \nlegislation's provisions as part of S. 2694, a broader legislative \npackage that passed out of committee last week.\n  In keeping with the objectives of our original Rural Veterans Care \nAct, this legislation would create an Office of Rural Health within the \nVeterans Health Administration. The new office would be responsible for \ntaking a number of steps aimed at improving the way we provide care to \nrural veterans. Specifically, the Office of Rural Health would be \ncharged with conducting, promoting, and disseminating research into \nissues affecting rural veterans, and developing and refining policies \nand programs to improve care and services for rural veterans. Because \nnearly one in every four veterans is from a rural area, the creation of \nthis Office of Rural Health is crucial if we are to live up to our \npromise to provide all of our Nation's veterans with high-quality \nservices.\n  Through specifically designated officials in each of the country's 23 \nVeterans Integrated Service Networks, this office will have a real and \neffective presence in rural veterans communities. These individuals \nwill serve as regional officers responsible for consulting on and \ncoordinating research and policies in their respective service \nnetworks. Their insight into how to provide rural veterans in their \nareas with the best health care possible will be incredibly useful and \nwill help expand the reach of the new office outside the beltway, and \nto all corners of the country.\n  The Office of Rural Health will also be required to conduct a study \non the feasibility of expanding the use of fee-basis care, whereby the \nVA contracts its services out on a limited basis to third party \nproviders. I continue to believe we should carefully explore every \navailable option when it comes to improving access to care for veterans \nliving in rural areas, and I am happy that this legislation will \nprovide a way to do just that.\n  With almost one-quarter of our Nation's veterans living in rural \ncommunities, and with the obstacles they face with respect to accessing \nhigh-quality care so pronounced, it is obvious we need to do better. I \nam pleased that the Veterans' Affairs Committee has taken an important \nfirst step toward that goal, and I am committed to working with my \ncolleagues in the Senate, with the VA, and with veterans across the \ncountry to build on this momentum. This legislation may not be the \nwhole answer, but it is a start, and the dialogue we have helped to \nstart on this critical issue is long overdue.\n  I want to thank Senators Thune, Akaka, Burr, Murray, Baucus, Burns, \nConrad, Dorgan, Pryor, Lincoln, Murkowski, Thomas, and Enzi for \ncosponsoring the Rural Veterans' Care Act. I also want to thank \nChairman Craig and his staff for working with me and the rest of the \nbill's sponsors to include a provision creating a new Office of Rural \nHealth as part of S. 2694.\n  I know that each and every one of my colleagues deals with veterans \nissues and feels a deep sense of gratitude toward the brave men and \nwomen who have fought for our freedom. I hope we can join together in \nsupport of our rural veterans. We owe it to them to make sure our \nactions match our rhetoric when it comes to expressing our gratitude \nand fulfilling the promises we have made. Toward that end, I look \nforward to seeing this legislation passed by Congress and sent to the \nPresident for his signature.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/27/senate-section/article/S6557-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF WENTWORTH, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to the \n125th anniversary of the founding of the city of Wentworth, SD.\n  The first settlers came to Wentworth by horse or oxen-drawn wagons, \nand were mainly from Milwaukee, eastern Atlantic States, Minnesota, and \nIowa. The land had few trees, and most of the settlers built and lived \nin sod houses. On December 15, 1880, the land was surveyed and platted \nfor owner Rinaldo Wentworth and the town was later named for his \nfather, George Wentworth.\n  In 1880 the first business--a grocery store--opened its door in \nWentworth. In 1881, the first train came into Wentworth, in 1904 the \nfirst telephone line was installed, and in 1917 electric street lights \nwere turned on. There were several hotels that operated in early \nWentworth as well, including the Commercial Hotel, which is now on \ndisplay at nearby Prairie Village.\n  Wentworth will be commemorating its anniversary with a celebration \nfrom June 30 through July 4. The town plans to hold golf tournaments, \nparades, softball tournaments, car shows, and fireworks. The 5-day \nevent promises to be a great opportunity to celebrate such a historic \nmilestone.\n  Even 125 years after its founding, Wentworth continues to be a \nvibrant and progressive community. I am proud to honor the \naccomplishments of the people of Wentworth, and congratulate them on \nthis impressive achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/27/senate-section/article/S6557-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6557-S6558]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM CHRISTOPHER VILLAR\n\n Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, today I wish to share with you \nthe story of a remarkable young man from Milton, FL. William \nChristopher Villar, by all surface accounts, was your typical 22-year-\nold. He was attending community college with the hopes of one day \nobtaining a degree in business. He was working at a job that he loved, \nand he had recently gotten engaged to his long time sweetheart, Heather \nDieterich. His life was unfolding the way we hope that all of our \nchildren's lives will eventually unfold.\n  Certainly, it was not these things or even the fact that, as a young \nman, he was actively involved with his church that made him atypical. \nAnd it was not the fact that he was a star on the basketball court--\nmaking the All-Conference and All-State teams his senior year at \nCentral High School in Santa Rosa County--a high school he entered \nafter being home schooled for a number of years. Quite simply, it was \nhis selflessness and his unyielding love for his family that set him \napart.\n  Chris was the oldest of three boys. As such, he was fiercely \nprotective of his younger brothers. There is a story the family tells \nabout an accident that happened 12 years ago that illustrates this \nbest: Chris and Jacob, his youngest brother, were riding in the back \nseat of their father's car when the driver of a large recreational \nvehicle, coming over the peak of the I-10 bridge between Santa Rosa and \nEscambia counties, failed to slow down for a disabled vehicle. The \nsignificantly larger vehicle collided with Villar's car with \ndevastating force. Chris, in an instinctive moment and without thinking \nof his own safety, grabbed his 2-year-old brother Jacob--perched high \nin his car seat--and threw his own 10-year-old body over him to save \nhim. That should tell you volumes about the kind of person Chris Villar \nwas.\n  By and large, the people who knew Chris all said the same things \nabout him: He was a ``good boy'' and he had been ``raised right.'' That \nis a compliment we hear far too infrequently these days, but it is a \ntestament to his parents. It should make them proud.\n  I wish I could tell you that the story ends there that this \nexceptional boy will one day become an exceptional man, an exceptional \nhusband, and an exceptional dad. Unfortunately, on the evening of \nThursday, June 15, Christopher Villar's life came to a tragic end when \na car driven by a drunk driver crashed through the roof of his family's \nhome. This was an avoidable tragedy. This is a grave reminder of the \ndangers of driving while under the influence.\n\n[[Page S6558]]\n\n  Just moments before this tragedy began to unfold, Chris, like so many \nof us, had been enjoying the NBA playoffs with his family. He was a New \nYork Knicks fan but pulled for the Miami Heat in this series as a way \nto tease his younger brother, Matt. They were kidding about it, as \nbrothers do, when a loud noise was heard in the front yard. Whether it \nwas the sheer instinct of a protective older brother, the hand of God, \nor both, Chris pushed Matt away from himself and toward the middle of \nhis room just as the car crashed through the ceiling.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \ncommunity of Ashton, SD, on reaching the 125th anniversary of its \nfounding. Ashton is a rural community located in Spink County.\n  The city of Ashton was founded in the summer of 1881. There are \ncompeting stories of how the town was named: one that it was named for \nthe railroad official R.H. Ashton; one that a group of settlers from \nBoston named it for a town in England; and one that it was named for \nthe groves of Ash trees in the James Valley. The first store was \noperated out of a tent by Mr. McPherson. The town grew quickly, with \ntwo real estate offices, a blacksmith, and two lumberyards soon \nconstructed. The train arrived in Ashton in September of 1881, shortly \nfollowed by the telegraph. The post office was established on December \n8, 1881. Other early buildings on in Ashton were the Bowman House, CC \nMorris General Store, Basset and Kelly's Hardware, Anderson's Bakery, \nand Reed, and Kelsey's Drug Store.\n  Ashton was named county seat of Spink County by the Territorial \nLegislature in 1885, though the seat moved to Redfield about 2 years \nlater. The people of Ashton endured a series of disasters in the \nensuing years. There were large fires in 1887, 1890, 1908, and 1910. \nAlso, a tornado damaged much of the town in 1897.\n  Today, Ashton is still a thriving community. There are many active \nbusinesses operating in Ashton, such as a seed and spraying store; \nplumbing, heating and sheet metal services; a post office; and \nneighborhood bar.\n  The people of Ashton celebrated this momentous occasion on the \nweekend of June 16-18. 125 years after its founding, Ashton remains a \nvital community and a great asset to the wonderful State of South \nDakota. I am proud to honor Ashton on this historic milestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/27/senate-section/article/S6558-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6558]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:22 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4416.

A bill to amend the Older Americans Act of 1965 to authorize \nappropriations for fiscal years 2007 through 2011, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator DeWine, Senator \nKennedy and Senator Mikulski in introducing the Older Americans Act \nAmendments of 2006.\n  The Older Americans Act Amendments of 2006 is the primary source for \nthe delivery of social and nutrition services for older individuals. \nEnacted in 1965, the act's programs include supportive services, \ncongregate and home-delivered nutrition services, community service \nemployment, the long-term care ombudsman program, and services to \nprevent the abuse, neglect and exploitation of older individuals. The \nact also provides grants to Native Americans and research, training, \nand demonstration activities.\n  The 2000 amendments to the act authorized the National Family \nCaregiver Support Program; allowed State agencies on aging to impose \ncost-sharing for certain supportive services for older persons; revised \nthe State funding formulas; and required the Department of Labor to \nestablish performance measures for the community service employment \nprogram.\n  Title I of the Older Americans Act set broad social policy objective \nto improve the lives of all older Americans. It recognized the need for \nan adequate income in retirement, and the importance of physical and \nmental health, employment in community services for older individuals \nand long-term care services.\n  Title II established the Administration on Aging, AOA, within the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to be the primary Federal \nadvocate for older individuals and to administer the provisions of the \nOlder Americans Act. It also established the National Eldercare Locator \nService to provide nationwide information with regard to resources for \nolder individuals; the National Long-term Care Ombudsman Resource \nCenter; the National Center on Elder Abuse; the National Aging \nInformation Center; and the Pension Counseling and Information Program. \nThe 2006 amendments will establish an Office of Elder Abuse Prevention \nand Services to develop a long-term plan and national response to elder \nabuse prevention, detection, treatment, and intervention. Further, the \n2006 amendments strengthen the leadership of the Department of Health \nand Human Services through an interagency coordinating committee to \nguide policy and program development across the Federal Government with \nrespect to aging and demographic changes.\n\n  Title III authorized grants to State and area agencies on aging to \nact as\n\n[[Page S6562]]\n\nadvocates on behalf of older individuals. Title III services are \ntargeted to those with the greatest economic and social need, \nparticularly low-income minority persons and older persons residing in \nrural communities. It funds supportive services, congregate and home-\ndelivered meals, transportation, home care, adult day care, information \nassistance, and legal assistance. The 2006 amendments will expand the \nCaregiver Support Program to permit the use of volunteers to enhance \nservices and increase program authorization levels. In addition, the \nbill contains a new demonstration project that promises to lead to \nchanges in our long-term care delivery system, leading to consumer \ndriven choices.\n  Title IV authorized grants for training, research, and demonstration \nprojects in the field of aging. This title supports a wide range of \nprojects including those related to income, health, housing, retirement \nand long-term care, as well as career preparation and continuing \neducation. The 2006 amendments will expand gerontology training for \nminority students; multigenerational activities, and civic engagement \nactivities.\n  Title V authorized the community service employment program for older \nAmericans known as the Senior Community Service Employment or SCSEP--to \npromote part-time opportunities in community service for unemployed, \nlow-income persons who are 55 years or older and who have poor \nemployment prospects. It is administered by the Department of Labor. \nThe 2006 amendments establish 4-year grant cycles for the competitive \nprogram and permit poor performing grantees to be terminated from the \nprogram based on performance measures and establishes a 3 year limit \nfor participating in subsidized employment with a 20-percent waiver for \ndifficult to place individuals.\n  Title VI authorized funds for Supportive and nutrition services for \nolder Native Americans. The 2006 amendments will increase the funding \nlevels for this program.\n  Title VII authorized the long-term care ombudsman program and elder \nabuse, neglect and exploitation prevention programs. The 2006 \namendments will enhance the elder abuse prevention activities by \nawarding grants to States and Indian tribes to enable them to \nstrengthen long-term care and provide assistance for elder justice and \nelder abuse prevention programs. It will create grants for prevention, \ndetection, assessment, treatment of, intervention in, investigation of, \nand response to elder abuse; safe havens demonstrations for older \nindividuals; volunteer programs; multidisciplinary activities; elder \nfatality and serious injury review teams; programs for underserved \npopulations; incentives for longterm care facilities to train and \nretain employees; and other collaborative and innovative approaches. \nFurther, it will initiate a new incidence and prevalence study and a \ndata collection process.\n  The proportion of the population aged 60 and over will increase \ndramatically over the next 30 years as more than 78 million baby \nboomers approach retirement. It is essential that in the coming years \nCongress and the Federal Government take a leadership role in assisting \nthe states in addressing the needs of older Americans. The bill we \noffer today will ensure that our Nation's older Americans are healthy, \nfed, housed, able to get where they need to go and safe from abuse and \nscams. The No. 1 resolution of the 2005 White House Conference on Aging \ncalled upon Congress to reauthorize the Older Americans Act during the \n109th Congress. I am pleased that the Senate and the House are well on \nthe way to accomplis1ing this goal on behalf of one of our Nation's \ngreatest resources--our older Americans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3570\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       ``Nothing in this title shall be construed to interfere \n     with or abridge the right of an older individual to practice \n     the individual's religion through reliance on prayer alone \n     for healing, in a case in which a decision to so practice the \n     religion--\n       ``(1) is contemporaneously expressed by the older \n     individual--\n       ``(A) either orally or in writing;\n       ``(B) with respect to a specific illness or injury that the \n     older individual has at the time of the decision; and\n       ``(C) when the older individual is competent to make the \n     decision;\n       ``(2) is set forth prior to the occurrence of the illness \n     or injury in a living will, health care proxy, or other \n     advance directive document that is validly executed and \n     applied under State law; or\n       ``(3) may be unambiguously deduced from the older \n     individual's life history.''.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Older Americans Act has been a \nlifeline for senior citizens across the country for 40 years, and all \nof us want it to continue to fulfill its important role in the years \nahead.\n  Like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, the Older Americans Act \nis part of our commitment to care for the nation's seniors in their \ngolden years.\n  This year, the first of the members of the baby boom generation will \nbe eligible for the act's services. One in nine Americans are over age \n65 today. By the year 2030, the number will be one in five.\n  It is clear we need to get our priorities right in this \nreauthorization. That means starting now to put the infrastructure in \nplace to provide services to baby boomers who retire. This bill takes \nsome of the necessary steps. It requires State and local agencies to \nacknowledge the changing demographics and to plan ahead. I hope \nCongress will continue to build on these efforts in the coming years \nand provide increased funds for the important programs in this act.\n  Our bill also encourages civic activities by seniors. Numerous \nexamples exist of successful volunteer programs involving seniors, such \nas Senior Corps, Experience Corps, and Family Friends, and we need to \nbuild on these successes.\n  The members of the new generation of older Americans obviously want \nto be engaged in their communities after they retire, and it is \nessential to draw on their experience and knowledge in constructive \nways.\n  The bill is also intended to encourage good nutrition, healthy living \nand disease prevention among seniors. The Meals on Wheels program, \nenacted in the 1970s, is one of its greatest successes, and \nMassachusetts has been in the forefront of the effort to provide \ncommunity-based nutrition services to the elderly. Our State program \ncoordinates 28 nutrition projects throughout the State to deal with \npoor nutrition and social isolation of seniors. Our bill will expand \nthe ability of programs such as Meals on Wheels to reach all older \nindividuals who need better nutrition.\n  According to the Census Bureau, 6.7 million persons aged 55 or older \nwill be living in poverty by 2008, a 22 percent increase since 2000. By \n2015, the number will increase to 9 million if the current trend \ncontinues.\n\n[[Page S6576]]\n\n  The Older Americans Act also provides essential opportunities for \nemployment of older Americans through the Senior Community Service \nEmployment Program, which offers job training for seniors and involves \nthem in the communities which they love, and which also love them. Last \nyear, the program supported 61,000 jobs and served 92,000 people.\n  Congress created this program to provide older adults with community \nservice opportunities. We recognized that senior citizens are \nespecially valuable assets to the communities in which they live. \nThrough community service, older adults are also provided with the job \ntraining they need to become self-sufficient in the workforce.\n  Unfortunately, in recent years the focus on community service has \nblurred, and many of us are concerned about the administration's lack \nof interest in maintaining this important aspect of the program.\n  Older Americans today provide 45 million hours of valuable service to \ntheir communities, particularly in senior centers, public libraries, \nand nutrition programs.\n  Overall, our bill maintains the emphasis on community service and \nenables the program to continue to serve older Americans efficiently \nand well. As this bill moves forward, it is essential that community \nservice remain paramount and that any attempts to weaken this program \nbe defeated.\n  This is a good bipartisan bill and I support its passage.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues on the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee--Chairman Enzi, \nRanking Member Kennedy, and Senator Mikulski--as we join in the \nintroduction of the Older Americans Act Amendments of 2006. Senator \nMikulski and I worked to draft and pass the Older Americans Act \nAmendments of 2000, and I am proud to have worked with her again to \nimprove and update these important programs.\n  I also thank Senators Enzi and Kennedy for making this \nreauthorization a priority for the HELP Committee. Over the months we \nhave negotiated this bipartisan bill, I have greatly appreciated their \nthoughtful and steady work to get the Older Americans Act to this \npoint. They understand well, as I do, that the quick passage of this \nreauthorization is the No. 1 recommendation that came out of the White \nHouse Conference on Aging. As I have mentioned in the hearings I have \nchaired of the Subcommittee on Retirement Security and Aging, the \npassage of the Older Americans Act reauthorization is the top priority \nfor the subcommittee. Today's bill introduction is an important step \nforward in that process.\n  As you know, older Americans are a vital and rapidly growing segment \nof our population. Over 36 million people living in the United States \nare over the age of 65, accounting for about 12 percent of the \npopulation. The Census Bureau projects that 45 years from now, people \n65 and older will number nearly 90 million in the United States and \ncomprise 21 percent of the population.\n  The Older Americans Act is an important service provider for these \nAmericans. I strongly believe this reauthorization updates and \nstrengthens the act in many ways. Changes to this bill include plans \nand means to prepare for changes to the aging demographics. This bill \ncreates a Federal interagency council responsible for ensuring \nappropriate planning for baby boomer-related needs and population \nshifts across agencies. Additionally, it will provide for grants and \ntechnical assistance for local aging service providers to plan for the \nbaby boomer population.\n  Our bill will also increase the authorization levels of the National \nFamily Caregiver Support Program by 25 percent over current \nappropriated levels over the next 5 years. This program is also \nexpanded to allow for those caring for loved ones with Alzheimer's--\nbetween the ages of 50 and 60--to become eligible for support services. \nFurthermore, it will clarify that this program will serve elderly \ncaregivers who are caring for their adult children with developmental \ndisabilities. Lastly, it clarifies that grandparents caring for adopted \ngrandchildren are covered under this program, and it lowers the age \nthreshold for grandparents to 55 years old. These are important changes \nto this program and will affect the quality of life for so many \nindividuals who are struggling with the pressures of caring for loved \nones.\n  This bill also encourages the voluntary contributions related to \ntitle III services from those individuals with a self-declared income \nat or above 200 percent of the poverty level and based on actual cost \nof service. This will help programs such as Meals-on-Wheels to expand \ntheir services and enable them to more effectively take contributions \nfrom those older Americans willing to pay for services. As the number \nof seniors increases, we need to modify our programs to ensure their \neconomic sustainability.\n  Our amendments will also allow the Department of Health and Human \nServices to award grants related to the improvement of assistive \ntechnology for older Americans. The goal of this provision is to enable \nolder Americans to have the necessary technology to monitor their \nhealth and help them remain in their homes as they age. We know most \nAmericans want to remain independent and in their homes as they age, \nand these grants will help them do just that.\n  This bill also creates a new grant program which provides grants to \ncreate innovative models that allow individuals to remain in community-\nbased settings. The need for this grant program was discussed at length \nin a hearing I held on models for aging in place--specifically \nnaturally occurring retirement communities. As I stated before, \nAmericans want to stay in their communities as they age, and this bill \nwill help them do just that.\n  Further, this bill creates a new grant program, based on \nrecommendations in the President's fiscal year '07 budget, to provide \ngrants to States to enable consumer-driven choices with respect to \nlong-term care. Grants can be used to encourage the planning for long-\nterm care for older Americans. It will also facilitate access to long-\nterm care choices and opportunities and advice on choices for care.\n  Our bill also updates the title V Senior Community Service Employment \nProgram, SCSEP, to allow for a mandatory 4-year competitive grant \ncycle. It provides a sense of the Senate supporting the community \nservice aspect of the program. Additionally, it limits the time on the \nprogram for participants to 3 years, with a 20-percent exemption for \ncertain hard-to-serve populations.\n  This provision balances the need for limiting the time a person \nspends in this employment program with the recognition that certain \npopulations have special needs.\n  Of great importance to me, this bill also amends the act to focus \nattention on the mental health needs of older Americans. These changes \nwill establish grants for mental health screening of older Americans \nand increased awareness of its effects on the elderly population. Too \noften the mental health needs of older Americans are overlooked; \nhowever, they can be as serious and life-threatening as any other \nillness. The mental health needs of our seniors must be taken more \nseriously and dealt with more aggressively. I believe this provision \nsignificantly moves us forward in this struggle.\n  Finally, this bill includes the language of the Elder Justice bill \nreported unanimously from the HELP Committee in the 108th Congress to \ncreate an office of elder abuse prevention in the administration on \nAging; create grants to the States and tribes to prevent elder abuse, \nneglect, and exploitation; and collect data from States and other \nentities on elder abuse. These are important provisions to improve the \nsafety and protect the well-being of our parents, grandparents, and \nother elderly loved ones.\n  Again, I thank Senator Enzi, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Mikulski \nfor their dedication to the needs of older Americans. I look forward to \nour continuing work together on this bill as we work to bring it to the \nSenate floor and the President's desk.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to support older Americans. \nSeniors today are living longer, healthier lives. We must do what we \ncan to help them be as independent and active as possible.\n  We have worked together on both sides of the aisle and with aging \norganizations, including the organizations that make up the Leadership \nCouncil on Aging, to introduce S.3570, the Older\n\n[[Page S6577]]\n\nAmericans Act Amendments of 2006, which I believe is a strong \nbipartisan bill. I would like to thank Chairman Enzi, Ranking Member \nKennedy, and Senator DeWine for their work. I have worked closely with \nSenator DeWine in the past, and this is the second Older Americans Act \nthat we have reauthorized together. This bill honors and maintains the \ncommitment we made to the nation's seniors through the Older Americans \nAct.\n  The Older Americans Act is one of our most important \nresponsibilities. The 1,200 delegates to the December 2005 White House \nConference on Aging voted reauthorization of the act this year as their \ntop priority. I am pleased that we were able to produce this bipartisan \nbill, but we still have work to do before the Older Americans Act is \nreauthorized.\n  We need to continue to work on the Community Service Employment \nProgram for Older Americans, in title V. Much of our bill is quite \nsimilar to what the House passed last week, but title V is not. Our \nbill has maintained the strong community service employment aspect of \nthe program, which has been an integral component since the beginning. \nThe House bill has elements that will minimize and chip away at this \ncommunity service employment element. The Community Service Employment \nProgram for Older Americans helps seniors obtain employment at Meals on \nWheels programs, senior centers, local area agencies on aging, public \nlibraries, and many other public organizations that rely heavily on \nthese seniors. Through community service employment, community \norganizations receive valuable support while participants receive \nvaluable skill training. I am strongly opposed to losing the community \nservice aspect of this program, and I am pleased our bill strengthens \nit. I expect that we will continue to protect this as we move to work \nwith the House.\n  There are several principles that I believe must guide \nreauthorization. First, we must continue and improve the core services \nof this act to meet the vital needs of America's seniors. Secondly, we \nmust modernize the act to meet the changing needs of America's senior \npopulation, including the growing number of seniors over 85, the \nimpending senior boom, and the growing number of seniors in minority \ngroups. Next, we must look for ways to help seniors live more \nindependent and active lives. Finally, we must give national, State, \nand local programs the resources they need to carry out these vital \nresponsibilities.\n  I believe the 2006 reauthorization bill strengthens current Older \nAmericans Act programs and offers innovative ideas that will address \nthe needs of our country's aging population. The reauthorization bill \nstrengthens information and referral services that are the backbone of \nOAA programs, providing seniors and their family members information \nabout supportive services and information needed to prepare for long-\nterm care. Our bill also strengthens elder abuse programs.\n  The reauthorization bill also improves the core services of the Older \nAmericans Act. Seniors have come to depend on the information and \nreferral services, congregate and home-delivered meals, transportation, \nhome care, and other OAA programs to meet their daily needs. Whether it \nis pension counseling or the long-term care ombudsman program--these \nare vital to helping seniors navigate the complex financial and health \ncare systems. Not all seniors have family and friends that can assist \nthem with complicated decisions, like choosing a long-term care \ninsurance plan or a nursing home. These programs put information in \nterms seniors can understand. These programs are a safety net for many.\n  I am especially pleased that this bill authorizes programs to \nencourage community innovation to support and enhance the ability of \nseniors to age in place. Seniors will be able to remain in their homes \nand communities, close to family and friends by providing them \nnecessary supporting services such as transportation, social work \nservices, and health programs to help seniors remain independent and in \ntheir communities. Grant program will encourage innovation and build on \nthe success of naturally occurring retirement communities, NORC, \nprograms. NORC programs have been developed at the local level and have \na proven record of success. We heard from successful programs in \nMaryland, Ohio, and New York at the Subcommittee on Aging hearing on \nNORCs last month. I thank them again for their work and leadership. I \nalways say that the best ideas come from the people, and this is one of \nthe best I have seen in a long time.\n  This bill also improves the National Family Caregiver Support \nProgram. With the reauthorization of OAA in 2000, we worked hard to \ncreate the National Family Caregiver Support Program. In 2003, this \nprogram provided assistance to nearly 600,000 caregivers. Services \ninclude respite care, caregiver counseling and training, information \nabout available resources, and assistance in locating services. These \nservices are invaluable to seniors and their families. We have worked \nwith the aging community to expand these services. Upon the advice of \nthe Alzheimer's Association our bill lowers the age eligibility for the \nprogram for individuals with Alzheimer's from 60 to 50, allowing more \nindividuals with Alzheimer's to qualify for services. Our bill also \nlowers the age of eligible grandparents to 55. This allows the program \nto target services to those who need it most.\n  Our bill also seeks to improve emergency preparedness for seniors. \nDuring Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, who was left behind? The elderly, \nthe sick, the disabled. We must plan for their needs and use the senior \nnetwork that exists in our country to make sure that they are not \nforgotten. Our bill requires States and Area Agencies on Aging to \ncoordinate to develop plans and establish guidelines for addressing the \nsenior population during a disaster/emergency.\n  I believe that this bipartisan reauthorization bill honors and \nmaintains the commitment Congress made to our Nation's seniors through \nthe Older Americans Act when it was first created in 1965. \nReauthorization of this program for America's seniors and their \nfamilies is one of our most important responsibilities. I look forward \nto continuing to work to get a bill passed this year. It is an \nimportant responsibility that we have to our Nation's seniors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. \n        Schumer):\n  S. 3852. A bill to prohibit brand name drug companies from \ncompensating generic drug companies to delay the entry of a generic \ndrug into the market; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, yesterday, the Supreme Court refused to \nconsider an appeal by the Federal Trade Commission to reinstate \nantitrust charges against a brand-name drugmaker. This decision leaves \nthe FTC powerless to stop one of the more egregious tactics used by \nbrand name drug companies to keep generic competitors off the market, \nleaving consumers with unnecessary high drug prices.\n  The way it is done is simple--a drug company that holds a patent on a \nblockbuster brand-name drug, pays a generic drug maker off to delay the \nsale of a competing generic product that might dip into their profits. \nThe brand name company profits so much by delaying competition that it \ncan easily afford to pay off the generic company, leaving consumers the \nbig losers who continue to pay unnecessarily high drug prices.\n  Since the appeals court decision, there has been a sharp rise in the \nnumber of settlements in which brand-name companies payoff generic \ncompetitors to keep their cheaper drugs off the market. In a report \nissued earlier this year, the FTC found that more than two-thirds of \nthe 10 settlement agreements made in 2006 included a pay-off from the \nbrand in exchange for a promise by the generic company to delay entry \ninto the market.\n  Yesterday's decision by the Supreme court is a blow to consumers who \nsave billions of dollars on generics every year. Today I am joined by \nSenators Leahy, Grassley, and Schumer, to introduce the Preserve Access \nto Affordable Generics Act. This legislation will prohibit these pay-\noff settlement agreements that only serve the drug companies involved \nwhile denying consumers access to cost-saving generic drugs.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, generic drugs save \nconsumers\n\n[[Page S6578]]\n\nan estimated $8 to $10 billion every year. And, a recent study released \nearlier this year by Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, showed \nthat health plans and consumers could save $26.4 billion over the next \n5 years by using the generic versions of 14 popular drugs that are \nscheduled to lose their patent protections before 2010.\n  Just last week, I was successful in including an additional $10 \nmillion in the fiscal year 2007 Agriculture Appropriations bill for the \nFood and Drug Administration's Office of Generic Drugs, an effort to \nhelp reduce the growing backlog of generic drug applications. The FDA \nOffice of Generic Drugs has reported a backlog of more than 800 generic \ndrug applications and more applications for new generics were received \nin December 2005 than ever before and this trend continues to grow.\n  But even approval by the FDA doesn't always guarantee that consumers \nwill have access to these affordable drugs. Of the six approved first \ngenerics for popular brand-name drugs taken by seniors over the last \nyear, only two have actually reached the market, while the others are \nbeing kept off of the shelves by patent disputes.\n  Mr. President, it is time to stop these drug company payoffs that \nonly serve the companies involved and deny consumers to affordable \ngeneric drugs. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3582\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President. I am pleased to introduce, with Senators \nKohl, Grassley, and Schumer, the Preserve Access to Affordable Generics \nAct of 2006, S. 3582. It is no secret that prescription drug prices are \nrapidly increasing and are a source of considerable concern to many \nAmericans, especially senior citizens and families. In a marketplace \nfree of manipulation, generic drug prices can be as much as 80 percent \nlower than the comparable brand-name version. Unfortunately, there are \nstill some companies that may be keeping low-cost, life-saving generic \ndrugs off the marketplace, off pharmacy shelves, and out of the hands \nof consumers by carefully crafted anticompetitive agreements between \ndrug manufacturers. This bipartisan bill will improve the timely and \neffective introduction of generic pharmaceuticals into the marketplace.\n  In 2001, and last Congress, I introduced a related bill, the Drug \nCompetition Act. That bill, which is now law, is small in terms of \nlength but large in terms of impact. It ensured that law enforcement \nagencies could take quick and decisive action against companies seeking \nto cheat consumers by delaying availability of generic medicines. It \ngave the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department access to \ninformation about secret deals between drug companies that keep generic \ndrugs out of the market--a practice that not only hurts American \nfamilies, particularly senior citizens, by denying them access to low-\ncost generic drugs but also contributes to rising medical costs.\n  The Drug Competition Act, which was incorporated in the Medicare \nModernization Act, was a bipartisan effort to protect consumers in need \nof patented medicines who were being forced to pay considerably higher \ncosts because of collusive secret deals. It is regrettable that we must \ncome to the floor again today and take additional action to prevent \ndrug companies from continuing to find and exploit loopholes.\n  I had faith that we were on the right track. However, two appellate \ncourt decisions from 2005 overturned the FTC's longstanding role of \n``policing'' these activities and making case-by-case determinations on \nthe appropriateness of proposed settlements, especially those that \ninvolved ``reverse'' payments. That refers to payments from a brand-\nname company to a generic company as opposed to payments from a generic \ncompany to the brand-name company for a license to make a particular \npatented drug.\n  The FTC rightfully sought U.S. Supreme Court review of the Schering-\nPlough v. FTC Eleventh Circuit decision. Unfortunately, the Supreme \nCourt refused to hear that case, leaving in doubt the continuing role \nof the FTC in policing settlements between brand-name drug companies \nand potential generic competitors. Moreover, in an unprecedented move, \nthe U.S. Solicitor General opposed the request by the FTC for the \nSupreme Court to hear this case. The inaction of the courts and the \nchoice of the administration to side with large drug companies over \nseniors and families has provoked us to take action and introduce this \nimportant bill.\n  This matter arises at the intersection of patent law and antitrust \nlaw. The drug companies naturally deny that their agreements violate \nthe antitrust laws, presenting them as private preliminary settlements \nbetween companies engaged in patent disputes. The problem is that the \nwhole point of the Drug Competition Act is to have an independent body, \nthe FTC, review these deals and to advise the companies if terms or \nconditions in the deal need to be changed to comply with existing \nantitrust laws.\n  Agreements to delay the production and sale of generic medicines in \nexchange for cash from the brand-name companies need to be carefully \nreviewed by the FTC under standards that give the FTC authority to act \nwhere necessary to enforce antitrust laws. Companies holding patents on \nmedicines should not be permitted to\n\n[[Page S6579]]\n\npay millions of dollars to potential generic competitors for the \npurpose of delaying the research, development, and sale of competing \ngeneric versions of medications when those generic companies believe \nthey have the legal right to sell such products.\n  I remain hopeful that during the process of working on this bill, a \nway can be found to give the FTC some discretion, on a case-by case \nbasis, to continue to evaluate these deals. Under this approach, only \nthe deals that are consistent with the intent of that law will be \nallowed to stand. There will be some deals that involve the payment of \nmoney which, on balance, could be good for the companies involved and \nfor consumers. The original intent of the Drug Competition Act was to \nprovide the FTC and DOJ with an opportunity to provide the companies \nwith useful and timely information so the drug companies could conform \ntheir deals to the law through confidential advice from the law \nenforcement agencies. I want that process to be continued.\n  Senators Grassley, Kohl, Schumer, and I are not the only ones who \nshare the goal of ensuring effective and timely access to generic \npharmaceuticals that can lower the cost of prescription drugs for \nseniors, for families, and for all Americans. I sincerely thank my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle who are working together on that \ngoal. We have devoted considerable attention to this matter in recent \nyears, and I look forward to passing this important bill.\n  In closing, I praise the FTC for spending so much time and energy on \nprotecting competition in the pharmaceutical sector. This represents a \nmassive workload for the FTC on top of all its other important \nresponsibilities to protect consumers and the American enterprise \nsystem.\n  Years ago, the FTC dealt with latter-day robber barons destroying \nsmaller companies; now the FTC has to try to restrain corporate drug \ngiants from robbing the elderly when these seniors buy prescription \nmedicines. I also appreciate the work of the FTC on the authorized \ngenerics issue and look forward to the report they are preparing for \nthe Congress on that matter.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 3584. A bill to amend chapter 41 of title 5, United States Code, \nto provide for the establishment and authorization of funding for \ncertain training programs for supervisors of Federal employees; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Federal \nSupervisor Training Act, FSTA, which addresses the inconsistencies and \nlack of adequate training for Federal managers and supervisors, \nespecially for new supervisors. The effectiveness and efficiency of \ngovernment programs and services depend on well-trained managers. It is \ncritical that federal managers receive the support and resources needed \nto do their jobs.\n  As new personnel reforms are sought by the administration for Federal \nworkers, which in my view are similar to those I opposed for the \nDepartments of Defense and Homeland Security, I see a general erosion \nof employee morale. Low employee morale impacts agency performance and \nundermines the public's trust in government. Therefore, we must \nconsider the needs of supervisors and employees alike. Enhancing \nsupervisory training improves communication, which leads to greater \nunderstanding of performance expectations and fewer performance \nproblems. A trained supervisor is the foundation for the success of any \npersonnel system.\n  The bill I offer today follows recommendations made by the \nPartnership for Public Service and the newly formed Government Managers \nCoalition, GMC, which represents over 200,000 Federal managers and \nexecutives who are members of the Senior Executives Association, the \nFederal Managers Association, the Professional Managers Association, \nthe Federal Aviation Administration Managers Association, and the \nNational Council of Social Security Management Associations.\n  FSTA will require new supervisory training for all new supervisors \nwithin a year of being appointed and mandatory retraining every 3 \nyears. Current managers would have 3 years in which to receive initial \ntraining. The legislation also requires training on how to mentor \nemployees, a key focus of S. 3476, the Homeland Security Professional \nDevelopment Act, which I introduced earlier this month. A third \nprovision requires training every three years on the laws governing and \nthe procedures for enforcing whistleblower rights and protections \nagainst race, gender, age, and disability discrimination.\n  Under FSTA, agencies would be required to set standards--based in \npart on guidelines developed by the Office of Personnel Management, \nOPM--that supervisors should meet in order to manage employees \neffectively, assess a manager's ability to meet these standards, and \nprovide training to improve areas identified in personnel assessments.\n  Supervisors want meaningful training. In my view, such training \nshould not be a discretionary option for agencies. Government managers \nand employees work on a broad and complex range of issues that are both \nnational and global in scope. From the skilled workers at the Pearl \nHarbor Naval Shipyard performing nuclear submarine battery change outs \nto Internal Revenue Service employees collecting back taxes, these \nFederal workers demonstrate commitment and dedication daily. They \nunderstand that trained managers empower them, which in turn improves \nprograms and saves taxpayers money.\n  Mandatory supervisory training is needed to ensure that agencies \nprovide this support to their managers. OPM once proposed 40 to 80 \nhours of training for new supervisors, but, over the years, this \nfunction has migrated to agencies, which, as the GMC notes, has \nresulted in inconsistencies in training among Federal agencies, leaving \na problem in search of a solution.\n  As the ranking member of the Senate Federal Workforce Subcommittee, a \nprimary goal of mine is to make the Federal Government an employer of \nchoice and to ensure the American people are served by a skilled \nworkforce. I see FSTA as a means to reach that goal because mandatory \nsupervisory training develops good managers who foster positive work \nenvironments that produce an efficient, effective, and responsive \ngovernment. The Nation's Federal workforce and the American taxpayer \ndeserve no less.\n  Mr. President, as I stated earlier, supervisors and employees alike \nbenefit from well-trained managers. I want to thank the Government \nManagers Coalition; the American Federation of Government Employees; \nthe National Treasury Employees Union; the International Federation of \nProfessional and Technical Engineers; the AFL-CIO, Metal Trades \nDepartment; as well as the Partnership for Public Service for their \nsupport of FSTA and I urge my colleagues to support the federal \nworkforce by cosponsoring my bill. I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of the bill be printed in the Record\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows.\n\n                                S. 3584\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to improve \nand expand the availability of health savings accounts, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Health \nSavings Accounts Improvement and Expansion Act of 2006. This bill will \nmake it easier for businesses to provide the option of an HSA to their \nemployees and for Americans to elect these plans.\n  In short, this bill will make it more likely that Americans will have \nan HSA plan available when they are making their health care choices. \nThis would be a good development for the individual consumer and the \nfor nation's health care system as a whole.\n  There is one thing on which we can all agree: our current health care \nsystem is broken. Health care expenses are far outpacing inflation. \nThese escalating costs are pricing more and more Americans and small \nbusinesses out of the health insurance market. Unless we act, our \nhealth care costs are on pace to bankrupt the Federal Treasury.\n  We need to do something.\n  The American people want us to do something.\n  Some favor an option that would give the Federal Government more \ncontrol of the health care system. In my opinion, that doesn't really \nfix the problem, it only makes the problem worse--leading to higher \ncosts, higher taxes, and decreased quality and availability.\n  I believe the answer lies in bringing down costs by helping Americans \nto take control of their health care.\n  Recognizing that a federally controlled universal system is a \nnonstarter, the House of Representatives has aggressively pursued the \nexpansion and development of Health Savings Accounts. In particular, \nCongressmen Eric Cantor and Bill Shuster have taken laudable steps \ntoward making these plans more readily available for American workers.\n  Congressman Bill Thomas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, is \ndemonstrating his and the House's commitment to these plans by holding \na hearing tomorrow to discuss the development of health savings \naccounts.\n  I am also proud to see that several of our Senate colleagues have \nintroduced legislation that would expand consumer driven health care. \nSenators Santorum, Allen, DeMint, Ensign, and Coburn have introduced \nlegislation to fuel the growth of health savings accounts.\n  My bill complements these plans by encouraging employers to offer HSA \naccounts and by making it easier for workers to use them.\n  Since Congress established HSAs in 2004, American workers have turned \nto them as an affordable health care alternative. Already, more than \nthree million people have enrolled in HSAs. Without any changes to the \nlaw, it is estimated that by 2008 there will be six million HSA owners \nwith almost $5 billion in assets.\n  HSAs are popular. And they are popular because they work.\n  HSAs are a different type of health insurance. They are more like car \ninsurance than traditional health insurance: You pay for the dents and \ndings yourself, and your insurance only kicks in for major events. This \nmakes sense. Think of how expensive your car insurance would be if \nevery scratch on every bumper had to be paid for by insurance companies \nwith no owner contribution.\n  Yet critics allege that promoting this type of insurance unfairly \nburdens older Americans and the chronically ill--those with the most \nhealth care needs. I would note that the premise of this argument is \noff the mark. For many Americans and businesses, the cost of health \ninsurance premiums are rising so astronomically that the choice is not \nbetween traditional first-dollar coverage or an HSA plan, but between \nan HSA plan and no insurance at all.\n  As the Galen Institute--a research institute that has done excellent \nwork reviewing the development of consumer-driven health care--has \nshown, HSAs are not only for the young and the healthy, but also for \nall health consumers along the age and income spectrum. In a survey by \neHealthInsurance--an on-line health insurance broker representing more \nthan 140 major health insurance companies--40 percent of HSA-eligible \nplan\n\n[[Page S6581]]\n\npurchasers made less than $50,000. Forty-five percent of purchasers are \nover age 40 and 19 percent are 50 or older.\n  Some argue that the healthy will migrate from traditional plans, \nleaving only the chronically ill in full coverage plans and driving up \ncosts by shrinking the insurance pool. This argument ignores a critical \nfact. Younger workers aged 25-34 are currently the largest segment of \nthe uninsured, in large part because insurance coverage is so \nexpensive. They represent 23 percent of the total uninsured population. \nBy bringing them into HSA plans, they will only bring premium costs \ndown further for the chronically ill who establish an HSA.\n  According to America's health insurance plans, AHIP, 37 percent of \nthose purchasing plans were previously uninsured. Twenty-seven percent \nof policies sold in the small group market were sold to employers who \ndid not previously offer coverage. According to Assurant Health, the \nleading health insurer for individuals and small groups, 40 percent of \nthose purchasing HSAs were previously uninsured.\n  Finally, it seems that American workers, and the chronically ill, are \nresponding to the incentives provided by these consumer-driven plans. \nMcKinsey & Company conducted an extensive survey of these plans. They \nheld focus groups, performed one-on-one interviews, and produced an in-\ndepth study of more than 2,500 Americans regarding their health \ninsurance arrangements. They concluded that these plans have a lot of \npotential. In fact, some of their conclusions were remarkable. Fifty \npercent were more likely to ask about costs and three times more likely \nto choose a less extensive and expensive treatment option. HSA owners \nare also more likely to visit an urgent care center for treatment \nrather than a hospital emergency room.\n  In addition, HSA consumers were more likely to be attentive to their \nhealth. Twenty-five percent were more likely to engage in healthy \nbehavior and 30 percent were more likely to get an annual physical. \nThese educated consumers understand that prevention will save them \nmoney in the long run. They were more likely to identify treatment \noptions and they were 20 percent more likely to comply with treatment \nfor chronic conditions.\n  It is no surprise that people are enjoying their HSA plans. According \nto a survey by eHealthInsurance, premiums for HSA-eligible insurance \nactually dropped between the introduction of these plans in 2004 and \nthe first half of 2005. Nearly two-thirds of HSA purchasers paid $100 a \nmonth or less for their plans. And these plans are comprehensive. Most \ncover 100 percent of the costs of hospitalization, lab tests, emergency \nroom visits, prescription drugs and doctors' visits after the \ndeductible is met.\n  The continued expansion of HSAs will have a twofold effect. For those \nwith insurance, the high deductible encourages more responsible, and \nless wasteful, health care decisions. For those without insurance, the \nwider availability and lower premiums makes it more affordable for \nindividuals to purchase these plans in the nongroup market and for \ncompanies to provide insurance for their employees. The bottom line is \nthat the expansion of these plans will create downward pressure on \nescalating health care costs.\n\n  My proposal aims to make HSAs more attractive to employees, more \nattractive to employers, and more attractive to older workers. And the \nbill provides innovative ways for younger workers to contribute seed \nmoney to fund an account for their family.\n  For employees, the primary benefits are increased contribution \nlimits, and the ability to pay their health insurance premiums from the \nHSA--with pre-tax dollars. Presently, the portion of premiums paid out-\nof-pocket is paid with after-tax dollars. This feature will make HSAs \naffordable for more low and moderate income individuals.\n  For employers, the bill provides incentives to move into low-cost \npremium arrangements. The health care costs of self-employed \nindividuals and small employers who purchase plans in the non-group \nmarket should go down for those who avail themselves of these improved \nHSAs.\n  For older Americans, this bill will permit contributions to an HSA as \nlong as they continue to work. Today, more and more Americans are \nworking past the age of 65. This is a trend we should encourage, \nbecause the labor force of the future will need more of these \nexperienced workers. Senior citizens contribute a great deal to the \nworkplace and our economy. I know that they are in Utah. Yet I hear \nfrom many of our older workers that because they are eligible for \nMedicare, they are ineligible for HSAs. Expanding contributions to a \npopulation that generally has more medical expenses makes sense.\n  The cornerstone of my bill is a provision that allows HSAs to be \nfunded with tax-free transfers of balances from other health or \nretirement plans. Participation in certain employer-sponsored health \nplans makes it impossible for employees to contribute to an HSA. For \nexample, health reimbursement arrangements--HRAs--are plans that allow \nemployers to reimburse substantiated employee medical expenses up to a \nmaximum amount. Under current law, participation in an HRA disqualifies \nan individual from contributing to an HSA and remaining balances are \nsubject to forfeiture.\n  I believe that employers that have adopted HRAs would be more likely \nto offer HSAs if they are allowed a one-time opportunity to transfer \nindividual HRA balances into HSAs. Allowing a one-time conversion \nopportunity would be very valuable for employees because the balances \ncurrently in HRAs would become employee-owned. Not only will this \nencourage responsible spending on health care, but it will also help to \nmake health insurance more portable, a goal that discourages job lock \nand creates more freedom and opportunity for American workers.\n  The bill provides for a tax-free transfer of IRA funds, originally \nallocated for retirement, to an HSA, with the money reallocated for \nhealth care expenses. This will be particularly helpful for those in \nneed of initial seed money to open an HSA and for those who anticipate \nhigh medical expenses for which they are currently unable to tap IRA \nfunds without penalty.\n  My proposal will make it easier for veterans to participate in an \nHSA. According to Treasury Department guidance, a veteran may not \ncontribute to an HSA if he or she has actually received medical \nbenefits from the VA at any time during the previous 3 months. This \nbill would allow a veteran who receives VA medical benefits for a \nservice-connected disability to be eligible for an HSA.\n  I am pleased to tell my colleagues that the changes proposed by the \nHealth Savings Accounts Improvement and Expansion Act of 2006 have been \nendorsed by a broad cross-section of major health care organizations. I \nam proud that the National Association of Health Underwriters, the \nAmerican Benefits Council, the Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers, \nAssurant Health, the Chamber of Commerce, the National Business Group \non Health, the Business Roundtable, and the Financial Services \nRoundtable have all endorsed my attempt to expand the availability of \nHealth Savings Accounts. These groups know how important HSAs are in \ngiving employees and employers the flexibility to meet their health \ncare needs.\n  Mr. President, I expect the popularity of HSAs will one day elevate \nthe acronym to the level of IRAs, where no further clarification is \nrequired. Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in a bipartisan effort \nto accelerate that process by enacting this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section description of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows.\n\n                                S. 3585\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; AMENDMENT OF 1986 CODE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``HSA \n     Improvement and Expansion Act of 2006''.\n       (b) Amendment of 1986 Code.--Except as otherwise expressly \n     provided, whenever in this Act an amendment or repeal is \n     expressed in terms of an amendment to, or repeal of, a \n     section or other provision, the reference shall be considered \n     to be made to a section or other provision of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n\n[[Page S6582]]\n\n       (1) The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and \n     Modernization Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-173) authorizes \n     health savings accounts (referred to in this section as \n     ``HSAs'') into which individuals may make annual \n     contributions of not more than $2,700, and families may make \n     annual contributions of not more than $5,450, to permit \n     spending by individuals for their health care needs.\n       (2) Federal law provides for obtaining health insurance \n     coverage through a low premium health plan offered with a \n     tax-favored HSA that typically costs substantially less than \n     traditional health insurance.\n       (3) Giving individuals more direct control over their \n     health care spending will encourage more prudent use of \n     health care services, help make the health care system more \n     responsive to the needs of consumers, and improve access to \n     health coverage for the uninsured.\n       (4) A broad range of improvements to the Federal laws \n     governing HSAs are necessary to make them more attractive to \n     consumers and employers.\n       (5) The number of people covered in January 2006 by \n     products combining an HSA with a low premium health plan was \n     3,168,000, more than triple the 1,031,000 reported in March \n     2005.\n       (6) HSAs have become an important option for consumers and \n     employers who have struggled to afford health insurance \n     coverage.\n       (7) According to a January 2006 census, 31 percent of new \n     enrollees in HSAs and low premium health plans in the \n     individual market were previously uninsured.\n       (8) HSAs combined with low premium health plans can provide \n     an affordable and accessible health insurance option for \n     individuals of all ages.\n       (9) 50 percent of all people covered by HSAs and low \n     premium health plans in the individual market, including \n     dependents covered under family plans, are 40 years of age or \n     older.\n       (10) Many States currently have in effect laws and \n     regulations that require insurers to provide specific benefit \n     coverage in the health insurance plans they offer, preventing \n     individuals and small business from enrolling in low premium \n     health plans and making them ineligible for HSAs.\n\n     SEC. 3.

account (as defined in section 223 of such Code) of \n     the employee which meets the requirements of paragraph (2), \n     and\n       (B) such plan thereafter terminates with respect to such \n     employee.\n       (2) Requirements.--A contribution meets the requirements of \n     this paragraph if--\n       (A) in the case of a flexible spending arrangement (as \n     defined in section 106(c)(2) of such Code) in existence on \n     June 1, 2006, such contribution is the remaining balance in \n     such arrangement as of the last day of the plan year ending \n     in or before the taxable year in which such contribution is \n     made,\n       (B) in the case of a health reimbursement arrangement in \n     existence on June 1, 2006, such contribution is the remaining \n     balance of the amount to be received in reimbursements under \n     such arrangement as of the last day of the plan year ending \n     in or before the taxable year in which such contribution is \n     made, and\n       (C) such contribution is made by the employer directly to \n     the health savings account of the employee not later than 60 \n     days after the end of the plan year of such flexible spending \n     arrangement or health reimbursement arrangement.\n       (3) Treatment as rollover contribution.--For purposes of \n     sections 223 and 4973 of such Code, a contribution which \n     meets the requirements of paragraph (2) shall be treated as a \n     rollover contribution described in section 223(f)(5) of such \n     Code.\n       (4) Tax treatment relating to contributions.--For purposes \n     of this title--\n       (A) Income tax.--Gross income shall not include the amount \n     of any contribution under this subsection.\n       (B) Employment

Flexible Spending \n     Arrangements (FSAs) are employer-sponsored plans that are \n     usually funded through voluntary salary reduction agreements \n     with an employee. Participation in these plans disqualifies \n     individuals from contributing to Health Savings Accounts \n     (HSAs) except in limited situations. The disqualification \n     from HSA contributions applies regardless of whether the \n     coverage is provided by the employer of the individual or \n     spouse of the individual.\n       Employers with existing FSAs or HSAs might be more likely \n     to offer health savings accounts if they were allowed a one-\n     time opportunity to transfer individual balances into HSAs. \n     FSA balances are subject to forfeiture when an individual \n     leaves employment and HRA balances generally revert to the \n     employer. Allowing a one-time conversion opportunity would be \n     very valuable for employees because the balances currently in \n     their employer-sponsored accounts would become employee-owned \n     funds to which they could also contribute in the future and \n     could keep as they change employment.\n\n[[Page S6584]]\n\n       Seeding an HSA Through an IRA Rollover--Section 3(b): HSAs \n     work in combination with High Deductible Health Plans \n     (HDHPs). Because the maximum deductible with an HDHP can be \n     as high as $5,250 for a family plan, with maximum out-of-\n     pocket expenses as high as $10,500, these plans can be \n     intimidating for young families or the chronically ill who \n     anticipate substantial medical expenses. To alleviate these \n     concerns and to allow an individual to ``seed'' an HSA with a \n     substantial amount of money, the Act would authorize a one-\n     time distribution from an IRA to an HSA, up to the amount of \n     the statutory out-of-pocket maximum. To accommodate a person \n     who elects this distribution while covered by an individual \n     plan, but who later has family coverage, the measure would \n     allow a one-time catch-up contribution of the difference \n     between the original contribution and the statutory limit on \n     out-of-pocket expenses for a family plan. These distributions \n     would not be subject to the ordinary 10% penalty for early \n     IRA distributions.\n     II. Eligibility to contribute to HSAs\n       Employee Who Has a Spouse with an FSA--Section 4(a): Under \n     current law, an individual may not contribute to an HSA if \n     his spouse has an FSA, even if the individual never seeks to \n     be reimbursed for any medical expenses from the spouse's FSA. \n     The proposal would allow contributions to an HSA provided \n     that the individual certifies that he will not receive \n     reimbursement for any health expenses from his spouse's FSA.\n       Older Employees--Section 4(b): Active employees over age 65 \n     are permitted to contribute to an HSA so long as the \n     individual is not enrolled in Medicare. However, individuals \n     are automatically enrolled in Medicare Part A (which covers \n     hospital expenses) upon reaching age 65 even though their \n     plan through their employer will typically continue to cover \n     their medical expenses until they retire. The Act would allow \n     older workers who participate in HSAs to be allowed to \n     continue to contribute to their accounts until they retire \n     despite the fact they were automatically enrolled in Medicare \n     Part A at age 65.\n       Veterans--Section 4(c): Under current law, a combat wounded \n     veteran who is eligible for medical benefits through the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is also HSA eligible. \n     According to Treasury Department guidance, however, the \n     veteran may not contribute to an HSA, if he or she has \n     actually received medical benefits from the VA at any time \n     during the previous three months. The Act would also allow a \n     veteran who actually receives VA medical benefits for a \n     service-connected disability to be eligible for an HSA.\n     III. Increasing value in HSAs\n       Increasing Contribution Limits--Section 5(a): Under current \n     law HSA contributions are limited to the lesser of the actual \n     deductible or the statutory contribution limit ($2,700 \n     individual/$5,450 family for 2006). The President has \n     proposed raising the contribution limit to the statutory out-\n     of-pocket maximum for HSAs ($5,250 individual/$10,500 \n     family). The proposal would permit mid-year enrollment and \n     allow individuals and families to contribute up to the \n     contribution limit, regardless of the actual deductible of \n     the plan.\n       Permitting Individual Family Members to Satisfy Individual \n     Rather than Family Deductible--Section 5(b): Most employer-\n     sponsored health plans begin providing coverage as soon as a \n     family member meets the individual deductible for the plan \n     rather than the full family deductible. Current HSA guidance \n     only allows this practice if the individual deductible is at \n     least the minimum deductible for family coverage ($2,000). \n     Allowing coverage to begin after a family member satisfies \n     the individual deductible amount would help to encourage more \n     employees to elect HSAs for themselves and their families.\n       Earlier Indexing of Cost of Living Adjustments--Section \n     5(c): The HSA statute directs Treasury to index deductible \n     amounts, out-of-pocket expense limits, and limits on \n     contributions to HSAs. Treasury is required to use third \n     quarter economic data when making these annual updates, which \n     means the new figures are typically issued in December, too \n     late for many employers who need to make these updates much \n     sooner in the year. Directing Treasury to complete the \n     indexing of these amounts by June 1, using first quarter \n     economic data, will give employers the information they need \n     in enough time to modify their plan offerings that take \n     effect the following January.\n     IV. Expanding the definition of qualified medical expenses\n       Premiums--Section 6(a): A large part of a family's annual \n     medical expenses is the cost of premiums for health \n     insurance. Under current law, high deductible health plan \n     premiums cannot be paid from an HSA. As a result, individuals \n     must pay their premiums with after-tax dollars. Employees \n     must use after-tax dollars to pay their share of premiums for \n     employer-sponsored coverage, unless their employer provides a \n     premium conversion plan under Section 125 of the Internal \n     Revenue Code. The proposal would allow high deductible health \n     plan premiums to be paid with pre-tax dollars from an HSA. \n     This provision will primarily help self-employed individuals \n     and others who purchase plans in the non-group market. \n     Further, it would provide an incentive for employers not \n     currently offering health insurance to make available a low-\n     cost high-deductible plan.\n       Medical Expenses Incurred Before Establishment of Account--\n     Section 6(b): Under current law, only qualified expenses that \n     are incurred after an HSA is established can be distributed \n     tax-free from the account. The Act would allow certain \n     medical expenses incurred before establishment of the HSA to \n     qualify as well. Generally, expenses incurred during the \n     taxable year in which the HSA was established or during the \n     preceding taxable year could be paid from the account without \n     penalty.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 3586. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe dollar limitation on contributions to funeral trusts; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will \neliminate the current limit on the amount individuals can place into a \ntrust to provide for funeral expenses. Given the rising costs of \nfuneral expenses, this change would have a positive impact on the lives \nof older Americans and on their families. In addition, according to the \nJoint Committee on Taxation, it would have a slight, but positive, \nimpact on the Federal Treasury.\n  Current law limits a funeral trust to $8,500, but this is generally \nno longer sufficient to cover a family's funeral expenses. In Utah, the \naverage cost of a full funeral and burial is $12,685. I am sure that in \nmany other States it is even higher. Because of this contribution \nlimit, even those who preplan their own funerals too often leave their \nheirs with substantial expenses. Even those who attempt to cover the \nentire expense may not have enough to cover all costs after \nadministrative fees and taxes are deducted.\n  This proposal would make qualified funeral trusts more effective. The \nprincipal reason individuals set up qualified funeral trust plans is to \nlift a financial burden from their children.\n  I recall the case of one constituent who wrote to me about this 3 \nyears ago. He was suffering from Parkinson's disease began preplanning \nhis own funeral so these decisions and this burden would be lifted from \nhis children. Because of the ``QFT Cap'' which at the time was $7,800, \nthis Utahn was not able to preplan completely the funeral services he \ndesired. It became necessary to have one of his sons complete this \npreplanning for him by opening up his own trust that would help to \ncover all expenses. It seems silly to make families go to these extra \nsteps when they are attempting to make responsible decisions, well in \nadvance of need, for themselves and their families.\n  For older Americans, the primary benefits of this legislation are the \nability to have all the money they have saved in the trust to be \napplied to final expenses, instead of taxes, and the incentive to \nincrease the amount of their contribution. Sixty percent of prefunded \nfunerals were funded by trusts and elimination of the cap should raise \nthis percentage. For funeral directors, this change would eliminate the \nburden and expense of issuing information documents to report income \nearned from the trust.\n  I think we can all agree that we should make it easier for those who \nare willing to provide for these necessary expenses in advance. Today, \nI ask my colleagues to join me in an effort to enact this important \nmeasure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3586\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 521\n\n       Whereas at the start of World War II, approximately 200 \n     Jews lived in the Republic of Albania, and approximately 1800 \n     Jews escaped to Albania from Western Europe and the former \n     Yugoslavia;\n       Whereas in 1934, United States Ambassador to Albania Herman \n     Bernstein wrote that, ``There is no trace of any \n     discrimination against Jews in Albania, because Albania \n     happens to be one of the rare lands in Europe today where \n     religious prejudice and hate do not exist, even though \n     Albanians themselves are divided into three faiths.'';\n       Whereas based on their unique history of religious \n     tolerance, Albanians sheltered and protected Jews, even at \n     the risk of Albanian lives, beginning with the invasion and \n     occupation of Albania by Mussolini's Italian fascists in \n     1939;\n       Whereas after Germany occupied Albania in 1943 and the \n     Gestapo ordered Jewish refugees in the Albanian capital of \n     Tirana to register, Albanian leaders refused to provide a \n     list of Jews living in Albania, and Albanian clerks issued \n     false identity papers to protect all Jews who traveled to and \n     hid in Tirana;\n       Whereas Albanians considered it a matter of national pride \n     and tradition to help Jews during the Holocaust, and due to \n     the actions of many individual Albanians, virtually the \n     entire native and refugee Jewish community in Albania during \n     World War II survived the Holocaust;\n       Whereas Albania had more Jewish residents after World War \n     II than before World War II;\n       Whereas in June 1990, Jewish-American Congressman Tom \n     Lantos and former Albanian-American Congressman Joe DioGuardi \n     were the first United States officials to enter Albania in 50 \n     years and received from the Communist Party leader and \n     Albanian President Ramiz Alia a thick file from the Communist \n     archives containing the records of the unpublicized heroic \n     deeds of hundreds of Albanians who rescued Jews during World \n     War II;\n       Whereas Joe DioGuardi, upon returning to the United States, \n     sent the file for authentication to Yad Vashem, the Holocaust \n     Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Museum in Jerusalem, Israel;\n       Whereas Yad Vashem has thus far designated 63 Albanians as \n     ``Righteous Persons'' and Albania as one of the ``Righteous \n     Among the Nations'';\n       Whereas in February 1995, Congressmen Tom Lantos, Benjamin \n     Gilman, and Jerrold Nadler and former Congressman Joe \n     DioGuardi spoke at a ceremony at the United States Holocaust \n     Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, commemorating the addition \n     of Albania to the museum's ``Righteous Among the Nations'' \n     installation;\n       Whereas based on the information authenticated by Yad \n     Vashem, Jewish-American author and philanthropist Harvey \n     Sarner published ``Rescue in Albania'' in 1997, to call \n     international attention to the unique role of the Albanian \n     people in saving Jews from the Nazi Holocaust;\n       Whereas in October 1997, the Albanian American Civic League \n     and Foundation began the distribution of 10,000 copies of \n     ``Rescue in Albania'' with forewords by Congressmen Lantos \n     and Gilman to bring to the attention of the Jewish people and \n     their leaders in particular the plight of Albanians living \n     under Slobodan Milosevic in order to forestall another \n     genocide;\n       Whereas on May 15, 2005, Jews and Albanians gathered in New \n     York City in a ``Salute to Albanian Tolerance, Resistance, \n     and Hope: Remembering Besa and the Holocaust'' on the \n     occasion for the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the \n     Nazi death camps; and\n       Whereas in a statement presented at the ceremony Dr. \n     Mordechai Paldiel, Director of the Department for the \n     Righteous at Yad Vashem, commemorated the heroism of \n     Albanians as ``the only ones among rescuers in other \n     countries who not only went out of their way to save Jews, \n     but vied and competed with each other for the privilege of \n     being a rescuer, thanks to besa'', the code of honor that \n     requires Albanians to save the life of anyone seeking refuge, \n     even if it means sacrificing his own life: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the people of Albania for protecting and \n     saving the lives of all Jews, both native and refugee, living \n     in Albania during the Holocaust;\n       (2) commends Yad Vashem in Israel and encourages others to \n     recognize Albanians who took action to protect Jews during \n     the Holocaust for their great courage and heroism; and\n       (3) takes this occasion to reaffirm its support for close \n     ties between the United States and Albania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/27/senate-section/article/S6585-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6585-S6586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 522--CELEBRATING THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CITIES \n              OF BRISTOL.

Res. 522\n\n       Whereas the twin cities of Bristol, Tennessee and Bristol, \n     Virginia were officially chartered in 1856, celebrated the \n     Bristol Centennial in 1956, and have organized to celebrate \n     the Bristol Sesquicentennial in 2006;\n       Whereas the Bristol Sesquicentennial theme, ``Celebrating \n     150 Years of heritage and harmony'' underscores the duality \n     of Bristol as a cohesion of 2 separate cities with 1 communal \n     spirit;\n       Whereas the ``Bristol Sign'', listed in the National \n     Register of Historic Places, serves to exemplify the communal \n     spirit of Bristol, bridge the States of Tennessee and \n     Virginia over the cooperatively named ``State Street'', and \n     declare Bristol ``A Good Place to Live'';\n       Whereas the people of Bristol continue to work to preserve \n     structures of historical significance, including the \n     Paramount theatre, the Old Customs House, and the historic \n     train station;\n       Whereas the phonographic recordings known as the Bristol \n     Sessions launched the country music careers of the Carter \n     Family, the Stonemans, and Jimmie Rogers, and prompted \n     historians to describe Bristol as the ``Big Bang'' of modern \n     country music;\n       Whereas country music is a central part of the history of \n     Bristol, which Congress recognized as the ``Birthplace of \n     Country Music'';\n       Whereas the history and economic development of Bristol is \n     intimately tied to commercial transportation and Bristol \n     continues to serve as an important commercial hub for the \n     surrounding region; and\n       Whereas automotive racing is integral to the identity of \n     Bristol and the ``World's Fastest Half-Mile'' at the Bristol \n     Motor Speedway continues to offer exciting events to scores \n     of racing fans: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) acknowledges the cultural and historic achievements of \n     the people of Bristol, Tennessee and Bristol, Virginia; and\n       (2) congratulates the twin cities of Bristol on their \n     sesquicentennial.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Frist, \nWarner, and Allen in offering a Senate resolution that celebrates the \n150th anniversary of the twin cities of Bristol, TN, and Bristol, VA.\n  Hanging on the wall of my Washington office near my desk is a \npainting of Bristol by George Smith called ``State Street at Seventh \nAvenue.'' This painting, which was completed around 1890, depicts the \nshared road that links the twin cities of Bristol and which serves as \nthe State line between Tennessee and Virginia. State Street Church can \nbe seen on the left side of the painting, the First Presbyterian Church \nis in the distance on the right, and the city saloon appears at the \nbottom. Thanks to continuing efforts in Bristol to preserve structures \nof historical significance, some of these buildings and many like them \ncan still be seen there today.\n  The twin cities were incorporated in 1856, the same year the Virginia \nand Tennessee Railroads reached Bristol. A second railroad arrived four \nyears later. From that point on, the population grew steadily as \nBristol emerged as an important transportation and commercial hub.\n  Today, Bristol is known for a different type of transportation. Since \n1961, the Bristol Motor Speedway has been host to NASCAR races and its \nfans. The Speedway, which began as drawings scratched on the back of \nenvelopes and brown paper bags, can now seat over 160,000 fans at its \nraces. The ``World's Fastest Half-Mile'' is acclaimed worldwide, and I \nhave enjoyed visiting the Speedway myself.\n  But Bristol is more than just a transportation hub. It is the \nbirthplace of country music--as declared by Congress in 1998.\n  The roots of country music in Bristol can be traced to the influences \nof Scotch-Irish immigrants in the mountain regions of Tennessee and \nVirginia--including my own ancestors--coupled with the unique hymns of \nNegro spirituals and work songs. A number of early Appalachian \ninstruments that helped spawn this new American form of music can be \nfound on the walls of my Washington office.\n  In 1927, Ralph Sylvester Peer arrived in Bristol hoping to produce a \ncommercial recording of these unique mountain sounds. That's how the \nrecordings\n\n[[Page S6586]]\n\nknown as the Bristol Sessions were born, launching the careers of \ncountry greats like the Carter Family, the Stonemans and Jimmie Rogers. \nThose sessions are often billed as ``the Big Bang'' that started the \ndevelopment of modern and marketable country music.\n  Bristol, TN, and Bristol, VA, may be two cities but they share a \ncommon spirit. You can't help but feel that spirit each time you visit, \nas I have had the pleasure of doing many times over the years.

Con. Res. 106\n\n       Whereas, for over half a century, a close relationship has \n     existed between the United States and Taiwan, which has been \n     of enormous political, economic, cultural, and strategic \n     advantage to both countries;\n       Whereas Taiwan is one of the strongest democratic allies of \n     the United States in the Asia-Pacific region;\n       Whereas it is United States policy to support and \n     strengthen democracy around the world;\n       Whereas during the late 1980s and early 1990s, Taiwan made \n     a remarkable transition to a full-fledged democracy with a \n     vibrant economy and a vigorous multi-party political system \n     that respects human rights and the rule of law;\n       Whereas President George W. Bush, in a November 2005 speech \n     in Kyoto, Japan, lauded the Government of Taiwan for its \n     democratic achievements;\n       Whereas, in spite of its praise for democracy in Taiwan, \n     the United States Government continues to adhere to \n     guidelines from the 1970s that bar the President, Vice \n     President, Premier, Foreign Minister, and Defense Minister of \n     Taiwan from coming to Washington, D.C.;\n       Whereas the United States Government has barred these high-\n     level officials from visiting Washington, D.C., while \n     allowing the unelected leaders of the People's Republic of \n     China to routinely visit Washington, D.C., and welcoming them \n     to the White House;\n       Whereas these self-imposed restrictions lead to a lack of \n     direct contact and communication with the democratically \n     elected leaders of Taiwan and deprive the President, \n     Congress, and the American public of the opportunity to \n     engage in a direct dialogue regarding developments in the \n     Asia-Pacific region and key elements of the relationship \n     between the United States and Taiwan;\n       Whereas, in consideration of the major economic, security, \n     and political interests shared by the United States and \n     Taiwan, it is to the benefit of the United States for United \n     States officials to meet with and communicate directly with \n     the democratically elected leaders of Taiwan;\n       Whereas, since the Taiwan Strait is one of the flashpoints \n     in the world, it is important that United States policymakers \n     directly communicate with the leaders of Taiwan; and\n       Whereas, Section 221 of the Immigration and Nationality \n     Technical Corrections Act of 1994 (8 U.S.C. 1101 note) \n     provides that the President or other high-level officials of \n     Taiwan may visit the United States, including Washington \n     D.C., at any time to discuss a variety of important issues: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the Sense of Congress that--\n       (1) restrictions on visits to the United States by high-\n     level elected and appointed officials of Taiwan, including \n     the democratically-elected President of Taiwan, should be \n     lifted;\n       (2) the United States should allow direct high-level \n     exchanges at the Cabinet level, in order to strengthen a \n     policy dialogue with the Government of Taiwan; and\n       (3) it is in the interest of the United States to \n     strengthen links between the United States and the \n     democratically-elected Government of Taiwan and demonstrate \n     stronger support for democracy in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/27/senate-section/article/S6586-3", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4543.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 522\n\n       Whereas the twin cities of Bristol, Tennessee and Bristol, \n     Virginia were officially chartered in 1856, celebrated the \n     Bristol Centennial in 1956, and have organized to celebrate \n     the Bristol Sesquicentennial in 2006;\n       Whereas the Bristol Sesquicentennial theme, ``Celebrating \n     150 Years of Heritage and Harmony'' underscores the duality \n     of Bristol as a cohesion of 2 separate cities with 1 communal \n     spirit;\n       Whereas the ``Bristol Sign'', listed in the National \n     Register of Historic Places, serves to exemplify the communal \n     spirit of Bristol, bridge the States of Tennessee and \n     Virginia over the cooperatively named ``State Street'', and \n     declare Bristol ``A Good Place to Live'';\n       Whereas the people of Bristol continue to work to preserve \n     structures of historical significance, including the \n     Paramount Theatre, the Old Customs House, and the historic \n     train station;\n       Whereas the phonographic recordings known as the Bristol \n     Sessions launched the country music careeers of the Carter \n     Family, the Stonemans, and Jimmie Rogers, and prompted \n     historians to describe Bristol as the ``Big Bang'' of modern \n     country music;\n       Whereas country music is a central part of the history of \n     Bristol, which Congress recognized as the ``Birthplace of \n     Country Music'';\n       Whereas the history and economic development of Bristol is \n     intimately tied to commercial transportation and Bristol \n     countinues to serve as an important commercial hub for the \n     surrounding region; and\n       Whereas automotive racing is integral to the identity of \n     Bristol and the ``World's Fastest Half-Mile'' at the Bristol \n     Motor Speedway continues to offer exciting events to scores \n     of racing fans: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) acknowledges the cultural and historic achievements of \n     the people of Bristol, Tennessee and Bristol, Virginia; and\n       (2) congratulates the twin cities of Bristol on their \n     sesquicentennial.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, S. Res. 522, which was just adopted, \ncelebrates the 150th anniversary of the cities of Bristol, TN, and \nBristol, VA. Throughout the year, the people of Bristol have celebrated \nthis anniversary, and the adoption of this resolution coincides with a \nnumber of exciting local events.\n  Bristol is a unique city because of the nature of its founding just \nalong the Tennessee and Virginia border in what started out as two \nseparate communities founded along an anticipated railroad route. \nThrough years of give and take and sometimes bitter disputes over that \nTennessee-Virginia border, Bristol has developed into a shining example \nof how hard work, cooperation, partnership, and entrepreneurial spirit \ncan lead to tremendous opportunities and to tremendous economic growth \nfor communities around the country.\n  What once modestly started as a connecting point between the Virginia \nand Tennessee railroads has developed into a central crossroad of the \ncountry's interstate highway systems.\n  While many people in the region are known to joke that ``all roads \nlead to Bristol,'' the city is not only a commercial crossroad, it has \nalso served as a gathering place for musicians from the Appalachian \nregion. Many country music fans know Bristol because of the famous \n``Bristol Sessions'' and recognize the city as the birthplace of \ncountry music.\n  Today when people think of NASCAR racing, they think about Bristol. \nIn the early 1960s, it was two Bristol natives who decided to build a \nracetrack in northeast Tennessee. A little over 40 years later, racing \nhas become America's fastest growing sport, and, indeed, the Bristol \nMotor Speedway is on the forefront of what is widely known as the \n``World's Fastest Half Mile''--I reiterate that cutting edge, the \nentrepreneurial spirit one finds in Bristol.\n  In closing, I am pleased to congratulate the twin cities of Bristol \nfor 150 years of cooperation and achievement. With this rich history \nand cultural heritage, Bristol represents the best of Tennessee and \nVirginia.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/27/senate-section/article/S6589-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S6589]]\n          COMMENDING THE OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY BASEBALL TEAM\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
