BROWN AND WILLIAM PRYOR\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today we will vote on the confirmation of \nJanice Rogers Brown to serve on the Court of Appeals for the D.C. \nCircuit. We are on a good path, a constructive, very positive path for \ngetting up-or-down votes for these judicial nominees, and we will stay \non that, as I just mentioned, over the remainder of this week, \nconfirming these judges.\n  After 2 years of delay, Justice Brown will finally get the courtesy \nof an up-or-down vote. She will finally get the respect she deserves by \ngetting an up-or-down vote. Indeed, all 100 Members, later today, will \nbe able to come to the floor and vote to confirm or reject--yes or no, \nup or down--her nomination. I am delighted we have finally reached this \npoint.\n  Following the vote on Justice Brown, we will move to the cloture vote \non Judge William Pryor. Similar to Justice Brown, Judge Pryor's \nnomination, in the past, has faced deliberate delay and postponement \nand obstruction. But with the progress we are making, I believe William \nPryor will also now get a fair up-or-down vote, a vote he deserves.\n  So I am very happy we have moved beyond the impasse on his nomination \nand that we are back to fulfilling our constitutional duty for advice \nand consent. That is what these nominees deserve. It gives them the \nrespect they deserve. It gives them the courtesy they deserve.\n  Mr. President, I will yield the floor. We will continue to vote on \njudges this week, and then next week we will be turning our attention \nto lowering energy prices, to lowering natural gas prices for \nAmericans, and we will be on that bill until completion. That is the \nEnergy bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/08/senate-section/article/S6176-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr President, I will vote ``no'' on Justice Brown's \nnomination to the D.C. Circuit.\n  Let me first remind my colleagues of the importance of this \nparticular circuit in our judicial system. The D.C. Circuit is widely \nregarded as the most important Federal circuit. It has jurisdiction \nover the actions of most Federal agencies. Many of the highest profile \ncases that have been decided in recent years by the Supreme Court \nconcerning regulation of economic activity by Federal agencies in areas \nsuch as the environment, health and safety regulation, and labor law, \nwent first to the D.C. Circuit. In the area of administrative law and \nthe interpretation of major regulatory statutes such as the Clean Air \nAct, the Clean Water Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and \nthe National Labor Relations Act, the D.C. Circuit is generally the \nlast word, as the Supreme Court reviews only a tiny minority of circuit \ncourt decisions.\n  The D.C. Circuit is now almost evenly split, and has been for some \ntime, between nominees of Democratic and Republican Presidents. There \nare five judges who were appointed by Republicans, including John \nRoberts, who the Senate confirmed earlier this year, and four by \nDemocrats, and there are three vacancies. President Clinton made two \nexcellent nominations that were never acted upon by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. In one case, the committee held a hearing but \nnever scheduled a vote, and in another, that of now-Harvard Law School \nDean Elena Kagan, the Clinton nominee was not even given the courtesy \nof a hearing.\n  I want to express my great disappointment that the administration has \nnot been willing to seek a compromise on the many vacancies that now \nexist on this court. By insisting on its often highly controversial \nchoices for this circuit in particular, the administration has \ncontinued to push the Senate toward the ``nuclear'' confrontation that \nloomed over the Senate before the recess. Regrettably, President Bush \nis responsible for much of the ill will that has plagued this body for \nthe past few years and the potentially disastrous upending of Senate \nprecedents that we faced last month and may well see again.\n  If only the President had really been a uniter and not a divider; if \nonly he had truly tried to change the tone in Washington and repair \nsome of the damage done to the nomination process by previous \nCongresses; if only he had not squandered the opportunity that the four \nvacancies on the D.C. Circuit as of his inauguration in 2001 presented, \nwe would not be in this situation today.\n  In light of this history and the importance of this Circuit, I \nbelieve it is my duty to give this nomination very close scrutiny. \nAfter reviewing this nominee's record and her testimony, I will vote \n``no.'' I do not believe she is the right person at this time to be \ngiven a lifetime appointment to this important court. The fact that a \nmajority of the Senate is apparently willing to confirm a nominee whose \nrecord so clearly demonstrates that she is not suited for such an \nimportant position is surprising and discouraging. I do not and will \nnever apologize for supporting the filibuster to protect the Federal \ncourts and the people of this country from her ideological, results-\noriented judging.\n  At her hearing, I asked Justice Brown about a case on age \ndiscrimination called Stevenson v. Superior Court. The majority in that \ncase said that Ms. Stevenson's wrongful discharge violated a \nfundamental public policy against age discrimination. Justice Brown \ndissented, saying that the plaintiff had ``failed to establish that \npublic policy against age discrimination . . . is fundamental and \nsubstantial.'' She went on: ``Discrimination based on age does not mark \nits victim with a stigma of inferiority and second class citizenship.''\n  These statements looked shocking when I read them, but I wanted to \nmake sure I understood Justice Brown's views, so I gave her a chance to \nrespond. I questioned her about the case in the Judiciary Committee, \nand concluded by asking if it was fair to say she believed age \ndiscrimination does not stigmatize senior citizens. She agreed that it \nwas. I appreciate her candor, but I have to say I found that testimony \nvery troubling. Senior citizens in this country live every day with the \nstigma of age discrimination; it is a real problem, and I think \neveryone here takes it very seriously. Just because we all will be old \nsomeday, and, therefore perhaps will be subject to prejudice and \ndiscrimination of this type, does not make it any less reprehensible. I \nhave not heard anyone in the Senate trying to defend Justice Brown's \nview on this issue; nor do I expect to, because it is truly \nindefensible.\n  I was also concerned by a comment Justice Brown made in 2000 about \nsenior citizens. She said: ``Today senior\n\n[[Page S6177]]\n\ncitizens blithely cannibalize their grandchildren because they have a \nright to get as much free stuff as the political system will permit \nthem to exact.'' When I asked her about this statement at her hearing, \nshe made no effort to distance herself from it.\n  Justice Brown seemed to suggest at her hearing that we should ignore \nher inflammatory speeches because she was just trying to be provocative \nin talking to audiences of youthful lawyers. She said that in her \njudging she is nonideological. The problem with that position is that \nthe caustic style and even some of the extreme language she used in her \nspeeches makes its way into her opinions. For example, in a 2000 speech \nentitled ``50 Ways To Lose Your Freedom'' in which Justice Brown \nsuggests there may be some validity to the substantive due process \ntheory of the Lochner case, she says the following: ``[I]f we can \ninvoke no ultimate limits on the power of government, a democracy is \ninevitably transformed into a kleptocracy--a license to steal, a \nwarrant for oppression.'' That is a pretty provocative statement to be \nsure.\n\n  In 2002, Justice Brown issued a scathing dissent in a zoning case \ncalled San Remo Hotel v. San Francisco. In that case, San Francisco had \na requirement that when residential hotels were converted into daily \nhotels, the owners pay a fee to help the government pay for affordable \nhousing that would make up for the housing that was lost in the \nconversion. This seems like a fairly mild requirement to me, and the \nmajority of the court saw nothing wrong with it. But her dissent used \nvery strong language to criticize the requirement. She said, in words \nthat sounds an awful lot like her speech, that San Francisco was \n``[t]urning a democracy into a kleptocracy.'' In case that was not \nstrong enough, she added that the government had imposed a ``neo-feudal \nregime.''\n  Frankly, I had a hard time imagining a more extreme statement than \nthat, but Justice Brown came up with one: ``But private property, \nalready an endangered species in California, is now entirely extinct in \nSan Francisco.'' (San Remo Hotel L.P. v. City and County of San \nFrancisco, 27 Cal. 4th 643 (2002).) She continued to use this dissent \nto showcase her extreme views on the takings clause: ``Where once \ngovernment was a necessary evil because it protected private property, \nnow private property is a necessary evil because it funds government \nprograms,'' she said.\n  In her dissent, she argued that the zoning fee did not \n``substantially advance legitimate government interests'' and therefore \nwas ``obviously'' unconstitutional. Justice Brown's colleagues on the \nCalifornia Supreme Court rejected her analysis. They noted that Justice \nBrown's approach to takings law would open a Pandora's box of judicial \nactivism, in that courts would have to examine the wisdom of a ``myriad \ngovernment economic regulations, a task the courts have been loath to \nundertake pursuant to either the takings or due process clause.''\n  On May 23, 2005--just last month--the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the \n``substantially advances'' test supported by Justice Brown in the San \nRemo case and affirmed that courts should not subject regulatory \ntakings cases to heightened scrutiny. Other than Justice Kennedy's two \nparagraph concurrence, the entire court, including Justices Scalia and \nThomas, unanimously agreed with Justice O'Connor's majority opinion in \nthis case, Lingle v. Chevron (No. 04-163,--S. Ct.--, 2005 WL 1200710 \n(May 23, 2005).)\n  The U.S. Supreme Court's critique of the district court in Lingle \nparalleled the San Remo majority's critique of Justice Brown's dissent. \nIn Lingle, the Supreme Court addressed whether a Hawaiian regulation \nthat prohibited oil companies from charging extraordinary rent to \nfranchisees constituted a regulatory taking. The Supreme Court held \nthat it did not, and the Court explicitly rejected the test Justice \nBrown used in her takings analysis. Like the majority in the San Remo \nopinion, the Court noted that if the ``substantially advances'' test \nwere the law of the land:\n\n       [I]t would require courts to scrutinize the efficacy of a \n     vast array of State and Federal regulations--a task for which \n     courts are not well suited. Moreover, it would empower--and \n     might often require--courts to substitute their predictive \n     judgments for those of elected legislatures and expert \n     agencies. Although the instant case is only the tip of the \n     proverbial iceberg, it foreshadows the hazards of placing \n     courts in this role. . . .\n\n  The Supreme Court rejected the district court's decision, and the \nview of the takings clause advanced by Justice Brown, because it would \nrequire that judges substitute their judgments for those of elected \nlegislatures--something that many of Justice Brown's supporters have \nspoken out against on the Senate floor.\n  As a former State legislator and now a Federal legislator, I \nappreciate and respect the Supreme Court's reluctance to endorse this \nactivist view of regulatory takings law promoted by Justice Brown. Some \nin this body, including many who style themselves advocates of judicial \nrestraint, would like to enact her views by legislation. They have \nevery right to try to do so. I will fight them hard, and fortunately, \nso far, they have not been successful. But for them to support a \njudicial nominee who so clearly wants to use her power as a judge to \npromote such a radical view of the law is disappointing.\n  Justice Brown's extreme comments in her opinions and speeches, and \nthere are many, many such quotations that were discussed at her \nhearing, lead me to question whether she has the temperament to be a \nfair judge. Despite her testimony at the hearing that ``I am not an \nideologue of any stripe,'' much of her record demonstrates the \ncontrary. She seems to view the world through an ideological prism, and \nshe expresses her views in the most divisive and striking language of \nany judicial nominee we have seen thus far.\n  Referring to cases upholding President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal \nlegislation, for example, Justice Brown has said that ``1937 . . . \nmarks the triumph of our own socialist revolution.'' She went on to say \nthat ``In the New Deal/Great Society Era, a rule that was the polar \nopposite of American law reigned.'' At her hearing, Senator Durbin \nasked her about another speech, where she said that ``Protection of \nprivate property was a major casualty of the revolution of 1937.'' She \nsaid, ``I don't think that's at all controversial.''\n  The court to which Justice Brown has been nominated has a docket that \nis laden with challenges to government regulations and interpretations \nof Federal statutes dealing with economic regulation. I am not \nconfident that Justice Brown will follow the law, rather than her \npersonal views on the law, in hearing those cases.\n  I have heard my colleagues argue that Justice Brown will follow the \nlaw faithfully on the court, that she will be constrained by precedent, \nbut I simply do not find these assurances reassuring. As Justice Brown \nherself acknowledged in the Hughes Aircraft case, ``all judges `make \nlaw'.'' When they are faced with questions of first impression, they \nhave no choice. And when they sit on a court of last resort, as Justice \nBrown does now, there is no one to stop them. Federal Courts of Appeals \nalso often hear questions of first impression. And for all practical \npurposes, they are often courts of last resort, because the Supreme \nCourt--again, an important point--reviews only a tiny percentage of \ntheir cases. So we must ask ourselves: How will Justice Brown use her \nenormous power as a Federal appellate judge when she has the \nopportunity to make new law?\n\n  Justice Brown's record does not give me comfort in answering that \nquestion. Too often, she seems to adopt contrary theories of judging \nand even statutory interpretation depending on which outcome she \nfavors.\n  When the plaintiffs were victims of employment discrimination, she \nsupported limits on punitive damages. (Lane v. Hughes Aircraft, Cal. \n4th 405 (2000).) But when the plaintiffs were property owners \nprohibited from increasing rent in a mobile home park, she opposed any \nlimit on damages. (Galland v. City of Clovis, 24 Cal. 4th 1003.)\n  When the California Supreme Court ruled that juries must be given a \ncertain instruction to protect criminal defendants, Justice Brown \ndissented because of her faith in juries: ``I would presume, as we do \nin virtually every other context, that jurors are `intelligent, capable \nof understanding instructions and applying them to the facts of the \ncase.' '' (People v. Guiuan, 18 Cal. 4th 558 (1998).)\n  But she suddenly stopped trusting juries when faced with the \npossibility\n\n[[Page S6178]]\n\nthat they might award punitive damages to employers found liable for \nracial discrimination, writing: ``When setting punitive damages, a jury \ndoes not have the perspective, and the resulting proportionality, that \na court has after observing many trials.'' (Lane v. Hughes Aircraft, 22 \nCal. 4th 405 (2000).)\n  When property owners would benefit from a literal interpretation of a \nvoter initiative, Justice Brown wrote: ``In my view the voters did not \nintend the courts to look any further than a standard dictionary in \napplying the terms. . . .'' (Apt. Ass'n of Los Angeles Cty. v. City of \nLos Angeles, 24 Cal. 4th 830 (Jan. 2000).) But only 11 months later, \nwhen those challenging an affirmative action program advocated a broad \ninterpretation of a voter initiative, she had a different view. She \nsaid: ``We can discern and thereby effectuate the voters'' intention \nonly by interpreting this language in a historical context.'' (Hi-\nVoltage v. City of San Jose, 24 Cal. 4th 537 (Nov. 2000).)\n  When she wanted to limit the explicit right to privacy in the \nCalifornia Constitution, she argued: ``Where, as here, a state \nconstitutional protection was modeled on a federal constitutional \nright, we should be extremely reticent to disregard U.S. Supreme Court \nprecedent delineating the scope and contours of that right.'' (American \nAcademy of Pediatricians v. Lungren, 16 Cal. 4th 307 (Aug. 1997).)\n  But when the majority of her court relied on analysis from the United \nStates Supreme Court on the question of remedies for a violation of \nconstitutional rights, she said: ``Defaulting to the high court \nfundamentally disserves the independent force and effect of our \nConstitution. Rather than enrich the texture of our law, this reliance \non federal precedent shortchanges future generations.'' (Katzburg v. \nRegents, 29 Cal 4th 300 (Nov. 2002).)\n  I urge my colleagues to review these cases before voting on this \nnomination. These examples lead me to conclude that the jurisprudence \nof Justice Brown is a jurisprudence of convenience. She is skilled at \nfinding a legal theory to support a desired result. I do not think that \nkind of approach to judging should be rewarded with an appointment to \nthe second highest court in the land.\n  This nominee has complained about ``militant judges'' while herself \nopenly defying precedent when it suits her; she believes that the New \nDeal was a ``socialist revolution'' and that America's elderly \n``cannibalize'' their grandchildren for handouts; she has expressed \ndoubts about the application of the Bill of Rights to the States \nthrough the incorporation doctrine and has suggested a return to an era \nwhen the courts regularly overturned the judgment of legislatures on \nquestions of economic regulation. Putting it simply, this nominee truly \ndoes have extreme views. To confirm her to a seat on the D.C. Circuit \nwould be a grave mistake. So I cannot support this nominee, and I will \nvote ``no.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. OBAMA. I thank the Chair.\n  I rise today to speak on the nomination of California Justice Janice \nRogers Brown to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Let me begin by \nsaying that the last thing I would like to be spending my time on right \nnow is talking about judges. I am sure that is true for many in this \nChamber. I know that I certainly do not hear about filibusters and \njudges when I go back to Illinois and hold townhall meetings with \npeople across the State. What I hear about are veterans who are \nconcerned about their disability payments and families who are talking \nabout how high gas prices are or how difficult it is to pay for \ncollege. And so I think this argument we have been having over the last \nseveral weeks about judicial nominations has been an enormous \ndistraction from some of the work that is most important to the \nAmerican people.\n  Moreover, I am not so naive as to think that speaking to an empty \nChamber for the benefit of C-SPAN is somehow going to change people's \nminds or people's votes. I recognize that most of my colleagues, on \nboth sides of the aisle, are fairly locked into their positions.\n  I do not expect the President to appoint many judges of my liking. \nOne of the things I have told some of my colleagues on this side of the \naisle is that there is only one sure way to make sure Democrats are \nable to block what they consider to be bad judges, and that is to win \nelections.\n  And yet I feel compelled to rise on this issue to express, in the \nstrongest terms, my opposition to the nomination of Janice Rogers Brown \nto the D.C. Circuit.\n  I think it is important for the American people to know just what it \nis we are getting. After the Supreme Court, as my esteemed colleague \nfrom Wisconsin just stated, the D.C. Circuit is widely viewed as the \nsecond highest court in the land. Three of our current Supreme Court \nJustices came directly from this court. Under its jurisdiction fall \nlaws relating to all sorts of Federal agencies and regulations. This is \na special court. It has jurisdiction that other appeals courts do not \nhave. The judges on this court are entrusted with the power to make \ndecisions affecting the health of the environment, the amount of money \nwe allow in politics, the right of workers to bargain for fair wages \nand find freedom from discrimination, and the Social Security that our \nseniors will receive. It is because of this power that we deserve to \ngive the American people a qualified judicial nominee to serve on the \nD.C. Circuit.\n  Now, the test for a qualified judicial nominee is not simply whether \nthey are intelligent. Some of us who attended law school or were in \nbusiness know there are a lot of real smart people out there whom you \nwould not put in charge of stuff. The test of whether a judge is \nqualified to be a judge is not their intelligence. It is their \njudgment.\n  The test of a qualified judicial nominee is also not whether that \nperson has their own political views. Every jurist surely does. The \ntest is whether he or she can effectively subordinate their views in \norder to decide each case on the facts and the merits alone. That is \nwhat keeps our judiciary independent in America. That is what our \nFounders intended.\n  Unfortunately, as has been stated repeatedly on this floor, in almost \nevery legal decision that she has made and every political speech that \nshe has given, Justice Brown has shown she is not simply a judge with \nvery strong political views, she is a political activist who happens to \nbe a judge. It is a pretty easy observation to make when you look at \nher judicial decisions. While some judges tend to favor an activist \ninterpretation of the law and others tend to believe in a restrained \ninterpretation of the law providing great deference to the legislature, \nJustice Brown tends to favor whatever interpretation leads her to the \nvery same ideological conclusions every single time. So when it comes \nto laws protecting a woman's right to choose or a worker's right to \norganize, she will claim that the laws that the legislature passed \nshould be interpreted narrowly. Yet when it comes to laws protecting \ncorporations and private property, she has decided that those laws \nshould be interpreted broadly. When the rights of the vulnerable are at \nstake, then she believes the majority has the right to do whatever it \nwants. When the minority happens to be the people who have privilege \nand wealth, then suddenly she is counter-\nmajoritarian and thinks it is very important to constrain the will of \nthe majority.\n  Let me just give you a couple examples. In a case reviewing \nCalifornia's parental notification law, Justice Brown criticized the \nCalifornia Supreme Court decision overturning that law, saying that the \ncourt should have remained ``tentative, recognizing the primacy of \nlegislative prerogatives.'' She has also repeatedly tried to overturn \nthe fact that California law recognizes Tameny claims, a line of cases \nthat establishes that an employer does not have an unfettered right to \nfire an employee, but that the right has limits according to \nfundamental public policy. She says judicial restraint is critical. She \nclaims that public policy is ``a function first and foremost reserved \nto the legislature.''\n  So on these cases dealing with a woman's right to choose, worker \nprotections, punitive damages, or discrimination, she wants the judge \nto stay out of the legislative decisionmaking process. But Justice \nBrown doesn't always want the courts to exercise restraint and defer to \nthe legislature. When Justice Brown wanted to limit the ability of \njuries to punish\n\n[[Page S6179]]\n\ncompanies that engage in severe discrimination, a fellow judge on the \nCalifornia Supreme Court accused her of engaging in ``judicial law \nmaking.'' Instead of denying it, Justice Brown defended her judicial \nactivism. She called it creativity. This is what she said: ``All judges \nmake law. It is arrogance, carelessness and a lack of candor that \nconstitute impermissible judicial practice, not creativity.''\n  Justice Brown has also gone out of her way to use her position in the \ncourts to advocate for increased protections for property owners. In a \ncase about a developer that wanted to break a city rent control law, \nJustice Brown dismissed the fact that a majority of the city's voters \nhad approved of that law and thought that the case should be an \nexception to the philosophy of narrow judicial review. Justice Brown \nbelieved that this case was one in which ``some degree of judicial \nscrutiny . . . is appropriate.'' Which is it, Justice Brown? In some \ncases you think we should defer to the legislature and in some cases, \napparently, you think it is appropriate for judges to make law. What \nseems to distinguish these two types of cases is who the plaintiff is, \nwho the claimant is.\n  If the claimant is powerful--if they are a property owner, for \nexample--then she is willing to use any tool in her judicial arsenal to \nmake sure the outcome is one they like. If it is a worker or a minority \nclaiming discrimination, then she is nowhere to be found.\n\n  Judicial decisions ultimately have to be based on evidence and on \nfact. They have to be based on precedent and on law. When you bend and \ntwist all of these to cramp them into a conclusion you have already \nmade--a conclusion that is based on your own personal ideology--you do \na disservice to the ideal of an independent judiciary and to the \nAmerican people who count on an independent judiciary.\n  Because of this tendency, and because of her record, it seems as if \nJustice Brown's mission is not blind justice but political activism. \nThe only thing that seems to be consistent about her overarching \njudicial philosophy is an unyielding belief in an unfettered free \nmarket and a willingness to consistently side with the powerful over \nthe powerless.\n  Let's look at some of her speeches outside of the courtroom. In \nspeech after speech, she touts herself as a true conservative who \nbelieves that safety nets--such as Social Security, unemployment \ninsurance, and health care--have ``cut away the very foundation upon \nwhich the Constitution rests.''\n  Justice Brown believes, as has already been stated in the Chamber, \nthat the New Deal, which helped save our country and get it back on its \nfeet after the Great Depression, was a triumph of our very own \n``Socialist revolution.'' She has equated altruism with communism. She \nequates even the most modest efforts to level life's playing field with \nsomehow inhibiting our liberty.\n  For those who pay attention to legal argument, one of the things that \nis most troubling is Justice Brown's approval of the Lochner era of the \nSupreme Court. In the Lochner case, and in a whole series of cases \nprior to Lochner being overturned, the Supreme Court consistently \noverturned basic measures like minimum wage laws, child labor safety \nlaws, and rights to organize, deeming those laws as somehow violating a \nconstitutional right to private property. The basic argument in Lochner \nwas you can't regulate the free market because it is going to constrain \npeople's use of their private property. Keep in mind that that same \njudicial philosophy was the underpinning of Dred Scott, the ruling that \noverturned the Missouri Compromise and said that it was \nunconstitutional to forbid slavery from being imported into the free \nStates.\n  That same judicial philosophy essentially stopped every effort by \nFranklin Delano Roosevelt to overcome the enormous distress and \nsuffering that occurred during the Great Depression. It was ultimately \noverturned because Justices, such as Oliver Wendell Holmes, realized \nthat if Supreme Court Justices can overturn any economic regulation--\nSocial Security, minimum wage, basic zoning laws, and so forth--then \nthey would be usurping the rights of a democratically constituted \nlegislature. Suddenly they would be elevated to the point where they \nwere in charge as opposed to democracy being in charge.\n  Justice Brown, from her speeches, at least, seems to think \noverturning Lochner was a mistake. She believes the Supreme Court \nshould be able to overturn minimum wage laws. She thinks we should live \nin a country where the Federal Government cannot enforce the most basic \nregulations of transparency in our security markets, that we cannot \nmaintain regulations that ensure our food is safe and the drugs that \nare sold to us have been tested. It means, according to Justice Brown, \nthat local governments or municipalities cannot enforce basic zoning \nregulations that relieve traffic, no matter how much damage it may be \ndoing a particular community.\n  What is most ironic about this is that what Justice Brown is calling \nfor is precisely the type of judicial activism that for the last 50 \nyears conservatives have been railing against.\n  Supreme Court Justice Scalia is not somebody with whom I frequently \nagree. I do not like a lot of his judicial approaches, but at least the \nguy is consistent. Justice Scalia says that, generally speaking, the \nlegislature has the power to make laws and the judiciary should only \ninterpret the laws that are made or are explicitly in the Constitution. \nThat is not Justice Brown's philosophy. It is simply intellectually \ndishonest and logically incoherent to suggest that somehow the \nConstitution recognizes an unlimited right to do what you want with \nyour private property and yet does not recognize a right to privacy \nthat would forbid the Government from intruding in your bedroom. Yet \nthat seems to be the manner in which Justice Brown would interpret our \nmost cherished document.\n\n  It would be one thing if these opinions were confined to her \npolitical speeches. The fact is she has carried them over into her \njudicial decisionmaking. That is why the California State Bar \nAssociation rated her as ``unqualified'' to serve on the State's \nhighest court. That is why not one member of the American Bar \nAssociation found her to be very qualified to serve on the D.C. \nCircuit, and why many members of the bar association found her not \nqualified at all.\n  It is also why conservative commentators, such as Andrew Sullivan and \nGeorge Will, while agreeing with her political philosophy, simply do \nnot see how she can be an effective judge. Here is what Sullivan said:\n\n       She does not fit the description of a judge who simply \n     follows the law. If she isn't a ``judicial activist,'' I \n     don't know who would be.\n\n  Sullivan added that he is in agreement with some of her conservative \nviews but thinks ``she should run for office, not the courts.''\n  Columnist George Will, not known to be a raving liberal, added \nrecently that he believes Justice Brown is out of the mainstream of \nconservative jurisprudence.\n  Let me wrap up by making mention of a subtext to this debate. As was \ntrue with Clarence Thomas, as was true with Alberto Gonzales, as was \ntrue with Condoleezza Rice, my esteemed colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle have spent a lot of time during this debate discussing \nJustice Brown's humble beginnings as a child of a sharecropper. They \nlike to point out she was the first African American to serve on the \nCalifornia Supreme Court.\n  I, too, am an admirer of Justice Brown's rise from modest means, just \nas I am an admirer of Alberto Gonzales's rise from modest means, just \nas I am an admirer of Clarence Thomas's rise from modest means, just as \nI am an admirer of Condoleezza Rice's rise from modest means. I think \nit is wonderful. We should all be grateful where opportunity has opened \nthe doors of success for Americans of every background.\n  Moreover, I am not somebody who subscribes to the view that because \nsomebody is a member of a minority group they somehow have to subscribe \nto a particular ideology or a particular political party. I think it is \nwonderful that Asian Americans, Latinos, African Americans, and others \nare represented in all parties and across the political spectrum. When \nsuch representation exists, then those groups are less likely to be \ntaken for granted by any political party.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n[[Page S6180]]\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for a couple \nminutes to wrap up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. OBAMA. I thank the Chair.\n  I do not think that because Justice Brown is an African-American \nwoman she has to adhere to a particular political orthodoxy, something \nthat has been suggested by the other side of the aisle. Just as it \nwould be cynical and offensive that Justice Brown be vilified simply \nfor being a Black conservative, it is equally offensive and cynical to \nsuggest that somehow she should get a pass for her outlandish views \nsimply because she is a Black woman.\n  I hope we have arrived at a point in our country's history where \nBlack folks can be criticized for holding views that are out of the \nmainstream, just as Whites are criticized when they hold views that are \nout of the mainstream. I hope we have come to the point where a woman \ncan be criticized for being insensitive to the rights of women, just as \nmen are criticized when they are insensitive to the rights of women.\n  Unfortunately, Justice Brown's record on privacy and employment \ndiscrimination indicates precisely such an insensitivity. I will give \none example. In a case where a group of Latino employees at Avis Rent A \nCar was subjected to repeated racial slurs in the workplace by another \nemployee, the lower court found that Avis, in allowing this to go on, \nhad created a hostile environment. Justice Brown disagreed with and \ncriticized the decision.\n  In her opinion, she wrote that racially discriminatory speech in the \nworkplace, even when it rises to the level of illegal race \ndiscrimination, is still protected by the first amendment. This was \ndespite U.S. Supreme Court opinions that came to the exact opposite \nconclusion.\n  Justice Brown went so far as to suggest that the landmark civil \nrights law, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, could be \nunconstitutional under the first amendment.\n  I believe if the American people could truly see what was going on \nhere they would oppose this nomination, not because she is African \nAmerican, not because she is a woman, but because they fundamentally \ndisagree with a version of America she is trying to create from her \nposition on the bench. It is social Darwinism, a view of America that \nsays there is not a problem that cannot be solved by making sure that \nthe rich get richer and the poor get poorer. It requires no sacrifice \non the part of those of us who have won life's lottery and does not \nconsider who our parents were or the education received or the right \nbreaks that came at the right time.\n  Today, at a time when American families are facing more risk and \ngreater insecurity than they have in recent history, at a time when \nthey have fewer resources and a weaker safety net to protect them \nagainst those insecurities, people of all backgrounds in America want a \nnation where we share life's risks and rewards with each other. And \nwhen they make laws that will spread this opportunity to all who are \nwilling to work for it, they expect our judges to uphold those laws, \nnot tear them down because of their political predilections.\n\n  Republican, Democrat, or anyone in between. Those are the types of \njudges the American people deserve. Justice Brown is not one of those \njudges. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMINT). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the remaining \ntime until 12 o'clock be allocated to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. Naturally, I am a \nlittle bit inclined to be in his corner because he is from Illinois and \nhe is my colleague in the Senate. But I also think what he demonstrated \nin his statement is the reason why he not only is so highly regarded in \nmy State of Illinois, but across the Nation, despite his new status in \nthe Senate. With his background as a professor of constitutional law \nand his life experience, he has brought special talents to this floor. \nI thank him for his eloquent statement on this important issue.\n  I guess most people are following this debate and are saying: What is \nthe Senate doing? Why are they sitting around debating day after day, \nweek after week about a handful of judges? Isn't there something more \nimportant to do? Shouldn't we be talking about the schools of America, \nwhether they are doing a good job educating our kids? Isn't it about \ntime Congress spends a few minutes talking about the cost of health \ninsurance to businesses, to people working, to families? Why in the \nworld won't somebody on the floor of the Senate stand up and talk about \nall the people across America who are losing their pensions, people \nworking 25, 30 years, and they are losing everything? So why do they \nsit there hour after hour and day after day talking about a judge? What \nin the world is wrong with those people in the Senate? Are they so out \nof touch with ordinary families in America?\n  Good question. It is a valid question. We are spending entirely too \nmuch time on a handful of judicial nominees, nominees who, frankly, I \nbelieve personally, should never have been presented to the Senate in \nthe first place. They are too radical, they are too extreme, they push \nthe envelope. When it comes to the ordinary process where a President \npicks a judge, it is almost routine around here. Oh, we take a close \nlook at this person. We want to know if that person is honest, has good \ntemperament, has good legal skills, is somewhat moderate in their \nviews, and if the answers to those questions are yes, that judge moves \nthrough the process quickly. There is not much to it.\n  In fact, take a look at the scorecard of what has happened with \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees: 209 of these nominees have almost \nskated through the process. It did not take any time at all. But over \nthe last 4\\1/2\\ years, nine of them have run into resistance and \ndebate, and that leads us to where we are today and where we have been \nfor several weeks discussing nuclear options and constitutional crises \nand constitutional confrontations. It is because President Bush insists \non sending some of the most extreme people to us for approval. If he \npicks moderate people, they fall into this category of 209 and move \nthrough here, but when some special interest groups get the attention \nof the White House and say, We have to have our person, then the \nprocess breaks down and the debate goes on. And instead of talking \nabout issues that matter to the families of America, we end up consumed \nin this debate over a judge for the D.C. Circuit Court.\n  So you say to yourself: Why do you do this? Why do you spend all this \ntime talking about one judge, for goodness' sake, out of the hundreds \nacross America? There are several reasons.\n  No. 1, if you as a voter in America decide to choose a certain man or \nwoman to represent you in Congress--either in the House or in the \nSenate--you are literally giving that person a contract to work for \nyou, but it is a limited contract. In the House, it is 2 years. I will \nvote for you, they will swear you in, and I will watch you. If you do a \ngood job, I may vote for you again. If you do a bad job, I will vote \nagainst you. It is 2 years in the House and 6 years in the Senate. It \nis a limited contract. So if I make a mistake as a voter and I choose \nsomeone to represent me in Congress and I watch him and say, Who in the \nworld are they representing; they are not representing me or my family, \nI can try to correct that wrong in the next election--2 years in the \nHouse, 6 years in the Senate. The voters speak.\n  But when it comes to judges, it is a different world. When the judges \ngo through this process and get the approval of the Senate, they are \ngiven lifetime appointments. If you love them, you have the benefit of \ntheir entire life on the bench committed to justice. If you do not like \nthem, you are stuck with them for a lifetime, which means these men and \nwomen who go through this process are never reviewed again. Except for \nthe most extraordinary cases of impeachment, they are there for life. \nSo we take a little more time because this is an important decision. It \nis a lifetime appointment of someone to the Federal bench, and we \nshould take the time to ask the most important questions, and we \ncertainly should take the time when we find one who is so exceptional \nthat it raises many questions about policy and philosophy.\n\n[[Page S6181]]\n\n  We should take the time to ask hard questions, questions such as, Do \nwe really want this person presiding on a Federal bench with all the \npower that brings for a lifetime if that person's views are so out of \nstep with the rest of America? Is that what we want?\n  Secondly, this is an important court. I will say this: One could call \nall 100 Senators together today and give them a blank sheet of paper \nand ask them to write down the names of all the judges on the D.C. \nCircuit Court of Appeals, and I guess we could not come up with one or \ntwo. We kind of know who they are, but it is not as if we get up every \nmorning saying: I wonder how that D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals is \ndoing today. I wonder if they all showed up for work. I wonder what \ncases they are considering. No, it is not that. The D.C. Circuit Court \nof Appeals has a reputation. It has a reputation of being the launching \npad for the Supreme Court. If one can get there, the highest regarded \ncircuit court in America, they are one step away from the building \nacross the street, the Supreme Court. And, yes, we do know the names of \nSupreme Court Justices, and we understand that many times each year \nthey make decisions which can change America. So when we talk about the \nD.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, we are talking about a court with great \npotential for the judges on it, and we are talking about a court with \njurisdiction over some of the most basic questions of government.\n  It is for those reasons, frankly, that we come to the Senate floor \ntoday to talk about Janice Rogers Brown. She is on the California \nSupreme Court. Of course, that is something that has been brought up \nmany times as an indication of at least the voters in California having \na positive view of who she is because they put her on the Supreme \nCourt. But what they do not tell us about Janice Rogers Brown is that \nwhen she was first appointed to the California Supreme Court, she was \njudged not qualified by the Bar Association. Oh, they say, wait a \nminute, she was reelected with an overwhelming percentage. Ah, but that \nis not the whole story. She was not running against anybody. It is \ncalled retention. We have it in Illinois, too. What it means is you \nkind of run against yourself. It is not as if you run against another \nperson. It is a ``yes'' or ``no'' vote on the ballot. Yes, she had a \nsubstantial percentage, but most judges running for retention do.\n  What we find in Justice Janice Rogers Brown is a person with such \nextreme views that it raises a serious question as to whether we want \nto give her a lifetime appointment to the second highest court in \nAmerica, whether we want to position her for ascendency to the Supreme \nCourt. That is what this boils down to. That is why this debate is \nbeyond the usual debate.\n  President Bush's term will come to the end in 2008, absent some \nconstitutional amendment, which I do not think will happen, and these \njudges, like Janice Rogers Brown, will be there long after George W. \nBush is off to another career, whatever it happens to be. So we need to \nask questions about who she is and what she believes.\n  What we do when we ask these questions is let her answer them. We \nhave committee hearings where we ask the questions directly, but in \nother cases we ask the questions in hypothetical terms: What does she \nbelieve when it comes to certain things? We look to what she has said \nand what she has done for those answers.\n  When one looks at it, they find that she really is on the fringe. She \nis not a conservative; she is something else. She is something much \nmore extreme. She has accused the courts of ``constitutionalizing \neverything possible'' and ``taking a few words which are in the \nConstitution like `due process' and `equal protection' and imbuing them \nwith elaborate and highly implausible etymologies.'' Strip away the \nhighfalutin language, and we get down to the bottom line.\n  The words ``due process'' and ``equal protection,'' which may be the \nforemost important words in that Constitution, she diminishes because \nshe believes they have been used by courts to create rights. What does \nshe say about the rights of Americans? Here is what she says: Elected \nofficials have been ``handing out new rights like lollipops in the \ndentist office.'' She has complained that ``in the last 100 years, and \nparticularly in the last 30, the Constitution has been demoted to the \nstatus of a bad chain novel.''\n\n  This is a woman who wants to sit on the bench and decide what the \nConstitution means, and the language she uses to describe what courts \nhave turned to in this Constitution I believe gives us pause because we \nknow that when it came 40 years ago yesterday, the Supreme Court across \nthe street found what they thought was in our Constitution, though it \nwas not explicit, and that was the word ``privacy.''\n  One can go through this entire Constitution and never find the word \n``privacy.'' Forty years ago, the Supreme Court across the street was \nasked the following question: Can the State of Connecticut make it a \ncrime for a married couple to buy birth control devices, pills, and \nother things? The State of Connecticut said: Yes, it is a crime, and we \nwill send you to jail if you try to buy it, and we will send the \npharmacist to jail who tries to fill the prescription.\n  Some people who are listening to this must be saying: The Senator \nfrom Illinois cannot be right. You mean it was against the law in \nConnecticut to even buy the birth control pill? Yes, it was.\n  So 40 years ago, the Supreme Court was asked: Can a State impose a \nlaw on its people so basic as to deny them the right to fill a \nprescription for birth control at a pharmacy? The Supreme Court across \nthe street said: No, because we are dealing with a basic constitutional \nand human right of privacy. As an individual in America, one should be \nable to exercise their right of privacy to make their family decision \nwhen it comes to family planning. So in the case of Griswold v. \nConnecticut, 40 years ago yesterday, the Supreme Court said: We find in \nthis Constitution the basic protection of your right of privacy. We do \nnot care that some religious groups pushed through this statute in the \nState of Connecticut. They went too far. If they want to practice their \nreligion, they can do that. But they cannot impose their religious \nviews on every family who lives in Connecticut.\n  So today, 95 percent of families go to a drugstore and a pharmacy \nacross America with no questions asked and buy basic family planning. \nThey know what they want, and they are purchasing it. They have the \nright to do it because nine people sitting on the bench across the \nstreet said it is fundamental to being an American.\n  Listen to Janice Rogers Brown's view of what this Constitution says. \nUnderstand that when she faced the issue on whether there would be this \nbasic right of privacy, she was the only dissenter on the California \nSupreme Court. Seven justices on the Supreme Court, six Republicans and \none Democrat--she was one of the Republicans--she was the only \ndissenter. Here is what the case involved. It was the California \nantidiscrimination law providing health benefits for women. Janice \nRogers Brown was the only dissenter. She argued that California could \nnot require private employers to provide contraceptive drug benefits \nfor women who wanted them. She ignored Griswold v. Connecticut. She \nignored the inherent right to privacy. From her point of view, the \nState of California could prohibit the right of family planning \ninformation under health care plans sold in that State.\n  She wants to turn back the hands of time to a day when it became a \nlegal struggle as to whether married men and women in this country \ncould plan the size of their own families, or make the most intimate \npersonal and private decisions without concern as to whether the \nGovernment would be watching over them and arresting them.\n  So when we say that Janice Rogers Brown is a danger if she comes to \nthe D.C. Circuit Court, it is because she views the Constitution in \nsuch restricted terms that she could write out the conclusion of \nprivacy which the Court found in Griswold v. Connecticut. That is how \nbasic this is. That is how fundamental this is.\n\n  This is not just another judge in another court making decisions one \nwill never hear about. It is a woman who is poised to move to the D.C. \nCircuit Court, the second highest court, one step away from the Supreme \nCourt, whose view of America is very different than what we have seen \nacross this country over the last 40 years when it comes to our basic \nrights of privacy.\n\n[[Page S6182]]\n\n  The things she said about America trouble me, too. It is not just \nthat she is conservative. President George W. Bush is conservative. He \ncalls himself a compassionate conservative. He defends Social Security \nas an institution, though he sees its future a lot differently than I \ndo. But when Janice Rogers Brown looks at Social Security and the other \nprograms that came out of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, what she sees \nis socialism. Here is what she said. She calls the year 1937 ``the \ntriumph of our own socialist revolution'' because the Supreme Court \ndecisions that year upheld the constitutionality of Social Security. Is \nthis a mainstream point of view? How many people do we run into who say \nwe ought to get rid of Social Security because it is just pure \nsocialism, it is too much government, we do not want to have Social \nSecurity there as kind of our last effort to provide a safety net for \nAmericans? Janice Rogers Brown essentially reached that conclusion. \nBecause of that extreme view, she became the poster child for the \nGeorge W. Bush White House to put on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. \nWhy do we have to reach so far afield to find someone to fill this \nspot? Why do we have to turn to someone who is so out of touch with the \nmainstream of America?\n  These are not just her philosophical musings, things she dreams up \nand talks about among friends. This is how she rules on the bench. \nGiven the opportunity, this is what we can expect in the future. She \nhas been the lone dissenter in so many cases involving the rights of \ndiscrimination victims, consumers, and workers. Case after case, in 31 \ndifferent cases, she was the only California Supreme Court justice to \ndisagree with the majority. She said once in a speech: ``Since I have \nbeen making a career out of being the lone dissenter, I really didn't \nthink anyone reads this stuff.''\n  Sorry, Justice, we do read it. Words matter, especially when they \ncarry the weight of law and change human lives.\n  I am concerned not only about the views she has taken but the way she \nhas expressed them. Justice Brown's extreme, often inflammatory \nrhetoric has no place on the bench. According to press reports, Justice \nBrown and the chief justice of her court are on such bad terms they do \nnot even speak to one another; they communicate by memo. Boy, is that \nthe kind of person we would like to have on a bench making big \ndecisions, where she reaches the point where she cannot even talk to \nher fellow justice?\n  In her lone dissent in the case involving cigarette sales to minors, \nselling tobacco to kids, Justice Brown wrote: ``The result is so \nexquisitely ridiculous it, it would confound Kafka.'' She also wrote in \nher dissent in this case that ``the majority chooses to speed us along \nthe path to perdition.''\n  Really? Regulating cigarette sales to kids is going to be leading us \non the road to hell? Too much government? And they want this person to \nsit on the second highest court in the land and decide about safety and \nhealth for Americans? What a serious mistake.\n  The last point I make, as my time runs out, is one expected to be \nsaid by a Democrat on this side of the aisle, but not expected to have \nbeen read in the Washington Post on Thursday, May 26, in an article by \nGeorge Will, a well-known conservative. He was very candid about \nJustice Janice Rogers Brown. He talked about the fact that she is one \nof the three who are part of the agreement here that is going to move \nforward. And he says:\n\n     . . . Janice Rogers Brown is out of that mainstream. That \n     should not be an automatic disqualification, but it is a \n     fact: She has expressed admiration for the Supreme Court's \n     pre-1937 hyper-activism in declaring unconstitutional many \n     laws and regulations of the sort that now define the post-New \n     Deal regulatory state. . . .\n\n  In a few words, George Will says it more elaborately.\n  She is out of the mainstream even for a conservative like George \nWill. If she is out of the mainstream for George Will and other \nconservatives, the big question today is whether five Republican \nSenators will agree with most Democrats that she should not be given a \nlifetime appointment to this bench to make the decisions and change the \nlaws and try to reverse the course of America.\n  When it comes to matters of personal privacy, when it comes to \nprograms as essential as Social Security, when it comes to protecting \nour children from tobacco companies and others who would exploit them, \ndo we really want Janice Rogers Brown with the last word on the D.C. \nCircuit Court of Appeals? I think the answer is clearly no, and that is \nhow I will be voting.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in listening to our Democratic \ncolleagues discuss the President's judicial nominees, I have often \nthought if I had a dollar for every time they use the words ``far \nright'' or ``extreme,'' I could one day retire a rich and happy man. \nSome have reached new heights, though, in histrionics and hyperbole in \ndiscussing the Janice Rogers Brown nomination.\n  For example, our very good friend from New York, Senator Schumer, \nactually said yesterday he could not think of any judicial nominee of \nPresident Clinton who was as far to the left as Janice Rogers Brown is \nto the right.\n  Just as an initial matter, many Senators on this side of the aisle \nhave noted that 76 percent of Californians--that is not 76 percent of \nTexans, or 76 percent of Alabamians, or 76 percent of Georgians--voted \nto reelect Justice Brown to the highest court of our most populous \nState, not known as a bastion of conservatism.\n  That certainly belies the notion that she is too conservative for the \nFederal bench. And with respect to the remainder of Senator Schumer's \nassertion that there were no far-left Clinton nominees who should have \nbeen disqualified from judicial service in the way he would disqualify \nJustice Brown, it seems to me our friend is suffering from a little \nmemory loss. I can think of a number of Clinton nominees who were very \nmuch on the far left of the political spectrum and yet who, today, wear \nthe robe of a Federal judge. My friend from Alabama has mentioned Judge \nPaez, for example. Senator Sessions noted that Judge Paez once remarked \nthat a judge ought to be an activist. Judge Paez said a judge ought to \nbe an activist if he believed the legislature was failing to address a \nproblem. That, as Senator Sessions points out, is the virtual \ndefinition of judicial activism.\n  There are quite a few other Clinton judicial nominees who reside over \non the political ``Left Bank.'' I do not have the time now to go \nthrough all of them, but I would like to discuss one, just one Clinton \nnominee in particular, a nominee with whom we are all very, very \nfamiliar. At the time of her confirmation, she had previously made \nnumerous provocative statements and public policy pronouncements. Even \nwhen looked at today, almost 30 years removed from when they were first \nmade, these statements are certainly not, by any standard, mainstream. \nBut our Democratic colleagues did not argue then, and I doubt they \nwould argue now, that these statements disqualified this Clinton \nnominee from Federal judicial service.\n  I speak of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whom I \nsupported. Let me note that Justice Ginsburg is a learned and \nexperienced judge. As I just indicated, I and the vast majority of our \ncolleagues voted for her. In 1993, she was approved 96 to 3 for her \ncurrent position on the Supreme Court. We did so, even though in her \nprivate capacity she had made some very thought-provoking comments on \npublic policy issues. She theoretically mused. These kinds of \ntheoretical musings frequently occur, as we all know, in academia and \nother extrajudicial writings. This is a good thing, frankly, in terms \nof having a healthy marketplace of ideas. While people's opinions \nshould be considered in evaluating their fitness for the bench, the \nfact that someone makes a thought-provoking comment is not necessarily \na reason to bar them from judicial service. This appears, however, to \nbe the standard our Democratic friends would apply to Justice Brown.\n  So I ask my friends, what would be their view of Justice Ginsburg, \nunder\n\n[[Page S6183]]\n\nthe new standard that they seek to apply to Justice Brown? For my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle whose recollections may be just \na bit foggy, let me remind them of some of her thoughts. She once \nproposed--this is Justice Ginsburg, for whom I voted and who has had a \ndistinguished record on the Supreme Court. We are not arguing about \nthat. But she once proposed abolishing Mother's and Father's Day in \nfavor of a unisex ``Parents' Day.''\n  She also called for making prisons and reformatories co-ed, and sex \nintegrated.\n  She argued that restrictions on bigamy were of questionable \nconstitutionality, and she opined that the U.S. Constitution might \nguarantee a right to prostitution.\n  She argued that there is a constitutional entitlement to have the \nGovernment pay for abortions. And, incidentally, when she made this \nassertion, the Supreme Court had ruled not once but twice that there \nwas no constitutional right to have taxpayers pay for abortions.\n  Justice Ginsburg has even suggested that statutory rape laws were \ndiscriminatory, and that the ``current penalty of 15 years for a first \noffense is excessive.'' She also suggested the adoption of a statute \nthat would, among other things, lower the age of consent for sexual \nactivity to age 12.\n  Given their past enthusiastic support for Justice Ginsburg's \nnomination--a nomination which I also supported--compared to their \ncurrent vigorous opposition to Justice Brown's nomination, our \nDemocratic colleagues must be saying one of two things: Either they \nbelieve that Justice Ginsburg's musings about a possible constitutional \nright to prostitution and the need to abolish Mother's and Father's Day \nand all the rest are in the mainstream--they either believe those \ncomments are in the mainstream, or they are saying it is OK for a \nDemocratic nominee to the Nation's highest court to make provocative \nstatements like that, but it is not OK for a Republican nominee to a \nlower court to make thought-provoking statements about policy issues.\n  I would be surprised if my Democratic colleagues believed that these \nvarious musings of Justice Ginsburg were in the mainstream. In fact, I \nthink they don't believe they were in the mainstream. So what we must \nhave, then, is truly a double standard.\n  I see my friend from Alabama is on the floor. I ask if Senator \nSessions is seeking time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask if the Majority Whip will yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank him, first, for his insightful remarks. It is \ncertainly appropriate and important that we distinguish between an \nAmerican citizen's right to speak and say things that may be on their \nheart at a given time and maybe later they are not so sure they agree \nwith. But we don't want to intimidate Americans and say you can never \nbe a Federal judge if you don't say anything but vanilla statements \nyour entire life. I thank him for his wise insight there.\n  It does seem we have a double standard here. It seems there has just \nbeen a deliberate effort to go back and sift through, bit by bit, line \nby line, speeches and statements and writings of nominees to try to \ntake them out of context and make them appear to be extreme when her \nrecord is one of mainstream, effective service. Justice Ginsburg was \nnot a nominee, certainly, that I would choose to nominate for the \nSupreme Court, but the Senate did not bar her from service on the \nCourt, the highest court in this land, because of her extrajudicial \nstatements that you just mentioned that are quite unusual, that she \nmade in law review articles and such, even though her thoughts and \ncomments were out of the mainstream.\n  I was not there at the time and the Senator was. But was it not true \nthat, at her confirmation hearing, Justice Ginsburg swore under oath \nshe would follow the law, and was it not also true that during her \nservice on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals she often voted with Judge \nBork and other conservative judges? In other words, just because she \nmade these statements, once she put on that robe and read the briefs of \nthe parties, she had some record that indicated she was committed to \nthe rule of law?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator from Alabama is absolutely correct. She \nswore she would uphold the law. You are absolutely right. When she put \non the robes, she was no longer sort of musing and making provocative \nthoughts; she was making law. In fact, I think the record reflects that \none year on the D.C. Circuit, before she was elevated to the Supreme \nCourt, then-Judge Ginsburg on the D.C. Circuit voted with then-Judge \nScalia 95 percent of the time and voted with Judge Bork, believe it or \nnot, 100 percent of the time--100 percent of the time. That, in spite \nof the fact that she had made some rather provocative--I think we would \nall agree--observations on a variety of different issues that I expect \nthe Senator from Alabama, and I, and the Senator from Georgia in the \nchair, and I bet virtually everybody on the other side of the aisle \nwould consider way outside of the mainstream to the left.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I couldn't agree more with the Senator from Kentucky. \nThat whole insight and principle cannot be lost here. We can't expect \npeople to be just ``Milquetoast'' human beings and never engage in \ndebate over important issues in America and never make a provocative \nstatement or they cannot be confirmed to the Federal bench. Frankly, as \none who practiced a lot of law, and I note the distinguished Majority \nWhip has, as well, the true test of a judge is: Will they study the law \nand will they be faithful to it? Will they read it and study it?\n  But with regard to these statements, wouldn't you say that compared \nto what you have mentioned, and some of the statements made by some of \nthe Clinton nominees, that Justice Brown's statements are mild, indeed?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would certainly agree. I know that Senator Boxer \nmade much ado about the fact that Justice Brown had dissented 31 times \non the California Supreme Court. But our good friend from California \nneglected to mention that this puts Justice Brown about in the middle \nof the pack, in terms of the number of dissents issued on the \nCalifornia Supreme Court. In addition, I would point out to my good \nfriend from Alabama--because of the esteem in which she is held by her \npeers out there on the California Supreme Court--Justice Brown was \nselected to write the second-highest number of opinions on the court, \nsecond only to the Chief Justice of that court. And numerous California \njurists have, to put it mildly, enthusiastically endorsed this \nnomination--the people who know her best.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I couldn't agree more. As I recall from the letter that \nwas sent to Senator Hatch, then-chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nall of her colleagues on the California Court of Appeals, which is just \nbelow the Supreme Court of California, have supported her, and four of \nthe six sitting Justices on the California Supreme Court have \noverwhelmingly, strongly advocated for her confirmation. It seems to me \nthe idea that she is out of the mainstream is farfetched and stretched.\n  I will ask one more question of the Senator. Isn't it true and isn't \nit sad that in this attempt to portray this nominee and others in a \nnegative light, that there has been, unfortunately, a tendency to take \nthings out of context? And isn't it true that some of these statements, \nthat might seem a bit strange or hard to understand, are not so hard to \nunderstand in the context of the entire remarks? Would the Senator \nagree that is a problem today in the Senate?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I think the Senator from Alabama is entirely correct. \nIt is simply amazing for our Democratic colleagues to say that Justice \nBrown, for example, has embraced the Lochner decision, when she has \ntaken the opposite position and written in a published opinion that \nLochner was a ``usurpation of power'' and the Lochner court seemed to \nbelieve it could ``alter the meaning of the Constitution as \nwritten.'' Indeed, many times her position has been essentially \nmisrepresented.\n\n  To get back to the basic point of our exchange, we ought not hold \nagainst nominees--particularly those who have written a good bit, \npublished a good bit--their provocative statements. We clearly did not \ndo that against Justice\n\n[[Page S6184]]\n\nRuth Bader Ginsburg, nor should we have. We ought not do that in this \nunfortunate attempt to demonize Justice Janice Rogers Brown, who has \nhad by any standard not only an outstanding life story but an \noutstanding record on the California Supreme Court.\n  I thank my friend from Alabama for being here during this discussion. \nWe hope this will help put the whole issue of provocative musings and \nwriting into context as a relevant factor in considering how we are \ngoing to vote to confirm judicial nominees.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If the Senator will yield, I will follow up on that.\n  I remember President Clinton nominated quite a number of justices, \njudges, who were active members--some lawyers--for the American Civil \nLiberties Union. If you look at the American Civil Liberties Union Web \nsite, they favor and believe the Constitution allows the legalization \nof drugs; that there cannot be a law against legalization of drugs.\n  They oppose all pornography laws--even child pornography laws--on \ntheir Web site.\n  We confirmed Marsha Berzon from California. She was chairman of the \nlitigation committee of the ACLU. There were quite a number of other \nmembers of the ACLU. We gave them a fair hearing. We asked their views. \nSome were answered satisfactorily to my view and some were not. \nFundamentally, the question was, will you follow the law of the Supreme \nCourt? Will you be faithful to those laws? Do you have a good \nreputation among your colleagues? Have you a record of integrity and \nachievement?\n  Most of those judges, virtually all of them, were confirmed.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator from Alabama is correct, and Berzon and \nPaez were the poster children for nominees out of the mainstream to the \nleft, yet the Senator from Alabama and others, and myself, joined in \nmaking sure these two nominees--dramatically out of the mainstream, to \nthe left--got an up-or-down vote in the Senate. When they did, they \nwere confirmed.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator for his wisdom and his fine \ncomments today.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, may I take a few minutes to go over some \nof the concerns that have been raised about Justice Janice Rogers \nBrown's rulings on some cases?\n  As the Senator from Kentucky and I discussed, some of her statements \nhave been taken out of context. It is not fair. We ought to be fair to \nnominees. We ought to be sure their reasoning, their thought processes, \nthe context of what they are doing, is brought to the attention of the \nAmerican public before we start twisting it to make them look like \nsomeone who is not in the mainstream.\n  I will talk about a couple of things; there are many we could talk \nabout. I will mention a few cases specifically that have been referred \nto by the attack groups that are attempting to put down these nominees, \nand by Senators who have picked up on it--maybe they are not lawyers, \nmaybe they are--but perhaps have not fully comprehended what the case \nis about or have been careless with the facts.\n  One of the charges some have heard, I think made again today, is that \nJanice Rogers Brown opposes all zoning laws. That is not true. That is \nabsolutely not true. One Senator, I believe Senator Dorgan, said she \nbelieves that zoning laws are the equivalent of theft and are \nunconstitutional. That is not true. That is not a fair characterization \nof her record.\n  This is what the San Remo case was about. First, she never said the \nzoning laws were unconstitutional. But the San Remo case in California \ncame before her. It involved a Draconian, overreaching zoning law that \nforced hotel owners--I know the Presiding Officer has had some \nassociation with real estate--forced hotel owners who wanted to convert \nlow-income residential units to hotel units to pay a large fee or \nreplace the residential units that would be lost. It was a takings \ncase. It was a question of whether this zoning law had taken away the \nability of private property owners to use their property to the highest \nand best use.\n  That is a big deal in America today. Even the liberal Supreme Court \nof California was troubled by it. It was a 4-to-3 vote. Justice Brown \nwas one of the three, but she was not the only one who dissented from \nthis rule. Her dissent was consistent with U.S. Supreme Court precedent \non property.\n  The classic case, not too far from the State of Georgia, was North or \nSouth Carolina. The person bought a lot on the beach, paid a lot of \nmoney for this, was going to build a dream home on the beach. They came \nalong and said: We are going to rezone this and you cannot build a \nhouse on the beach.\n  He put all of this money in a lot that he was going to build his \ndream house on and they said: You can keep the sands, Mr. Property \nOwner, but you cannot build a house on it. The Supreme Court of the \nUnited States of America said--and the same principle I believe applies \nin California--that this was an effective taking of the value of that \nproperty.\n  If the Government wanted to take it and make it a wildlife refuge, \nthey ought to take the property and pay them the fair market value for \nit. But what the zoning guys wanted to do, you see, is just say: You \ncannot use it. You cannot do anything with it. You have to do with it \nwhat we want you to do with it, but we are not going to pay you a dime \nfor the ability to have that property set aside for what we want it to \nbe set aside for.\n  That is why people who are concerned about property rights in America \nare upset about the abuse of zoning. But normal zoning goes on every \nday. And there is not one shred of evidence that Janice Rogers Brown \nopposes all zoning. In fact, she, as I said, had two other judges join \nwith her in that important case. Justice Brown, in the case, \ncomplimented the State of California for having a laudable regulation \nto try to provide more housing opportunities for low-income \nindividuals. She said that in her dissent, but noted that the \nCalifornia takings clause precluded the Government from achieving that \ngoal by police power regulation.\n  Another case that still bothers me--I mentioned it yesterday; and it \nis worth talking about again--is the Aguilar case. Senator Boxer and I \nthink maybe others on the floor have said that Justice Brown, an \nAfrican American, the daughter of a sharecropper from rural Alabama--\nshe grew up not too far from where I grew up--had said, in her opinion, \nthat it was OK for Latinos to have racial slurs uttered against them in \nthe workplace, that that was the position of Justice Janice Rogers \nBrown.\n  Now, this was the case of Aguilar v. Avis Rent A Car System. It \ninvolved a court injunction that barred a manager of the company from \nusing various racial epithets in the future, raising grave first \namendment concerns as a prior restraint. Justice Brown, in her dissent, \nstated: ``Discrimination on the basis of race is illegal, immoral, \nunconstitutional, inherently wrong, and destructive of democratic \nsociety.'' As to the specific slurs, she called them: ``disgusting, \noffensive, and abhorrent.''\n  In her dissent, however, she relied on the precedent of the Supreme \nCourt of the United States, in expressing her concern about an \ninjunction that placed an absolute prohibition, a prior restraint, on \nspeech. Again, the court in this case was divided, 4 to 3. One of the \ndissenters who joined with her was the liberal icon, Justice Stanley \nMosk--her colleague on the bench who is recognized as one of the great, \nmost prominent liberal judges in America--because speech is important.\n  I offered into the Record Monday an article by Nat Hentoff in which \nhe dealt with this particular case. He is a great civil libertarian \nlawyer. He has committed his life to American civil liberties. He \nbelieves in free speech. He said the majority opinion in Aguilar was an \noutrage, that it was totally wrong, that she was exactly correct, that \nthis was a prior restraint of free speech that could not be done under \nthese circumstances. So saying that Justice Brown believes it is OK for \nLatinos to have racial slurs uttered against them in the workplace is \nnot a fair thing to be saying about her.\n\n[[Page S6185]]\n\n  Senator Boxer also argued against Janice Rogers Brown, saying that \nBrown ``argued that messages sent by an employee to co-workers \ncriticizing a company's employment practices was not protected by the \nFirst Amendment. In other words, you can't use your e-mail to write \nanything about your employer to another employee.''\n  That is what Justice Brown has been accused of doing in her role as a \njudge. But the truth of the case is quite different from that. Senator \nBoxer is apparently referring to Intel v. Hamidi. It involved a \ndisgruntled employee who flooded Intel Corporation's servers with over \n200,000 spam E-mails, a costly disruption of the business. It raised \nserious nuisance and trespass to chattel issues. The question in the \ncase was whether you could commit a trespass to chattel through \nelectronic communications. The California Supreme Court said no because \nthere were no damages to the computer system nor impairments to the way \nit functioned. Justice Brown's dissent noted that Intel had invested \nmillions of dollars to develop and maintain its computer system to \nenhance the company's productivity and had a right to protect that \nproperty from unauthorized abuse by 200,000 spam e-mails. It was a 4-\nto-3 vote, again. Two justices on the California Supreme Court joined \nwith her.\n  This is not an extreme position to take, for heaven's sake. She again \nfound herself on the side of liberal Justice Richard Mosk. He argued \nthat the injunction should have been upheld because he was intruding \nupon Intel's proprietary network and his e-mails were equivalent to, \naccording to Judge Mosk, ``intruding into a private office mail room, \ncommandeering the mail cart, and dropping off unwanted broadsides on \n30,000 desks.'' That is what the liberal Justice Mosk said in agreeing \nwith Janice Rogers Brown.\n  So, goodness, it is a sad thing that we have to deal with these kinds \nof distortions of a fine justice's record. If this is all they can find \nto complain about, statements that are perfectly normal and proper, \nthen there must not be much out here against this nominee. One Senator \nsays: ``If a minority claims they are being discriminated against, she \nis nowhere to be found.''\n  Well, first of all, she is a minority. She left Alabama, I am sure, \nin some part, because when she was young, segregation was afoot and \ndiscrimination was very real to African Americans. She went to \nCalifornia. She commenced her legal career and her education and became \na member of the California Supreme Court. But he accuses her of not \nbeing found on discrimination. But what about her lone dissents? She \nauthored a lone dissent in People v. McKay, where an African American \nman was riding his bicycle the wrong way on a street and the police \nstopped him, searched him, found drugs and prosecuted him. She said \nthat was racial profiling. She was the only one who said that. Who was \nstanding up for someone who could have been a victim of discrimination? \nJanice Rogers Brown.\n\n  Another Senator said that ``she favors the powerful over the \npowerless.'' But how about her lone dissent in In re Visciotti--only \nshe dissented in this case--where she said a defendant's death sentence \nshould be overturned, because the defendant did not have an adequate \ncounsel, he was given ineffective assistance of counsel. She was very \nvigorous in her dissent in explaining why she thought it was inadequate \nand why she thought this individual deserved a new trial.\n  Well, those facts, to me, do not indicate we have a justice who is \nout of the mainstream or a justice who is not willing to defend \nindividuals with no power, no prestige, no money, those who deserve a \nfair hearing by a court. It is clear she is willing to give it to them, \nto give them that fair hearing, and to dissent even if six other \njustices on the liberal California Supreme Court do not agree with her. \nSo the other justices did not agree, but she stood up for these people. \nThat is her record. That is her heritage.\n  She is a wonderful, wonderful nominee. I am pleased she is up. \nHopefully, we will get her nomination confirmed today, and she can take \nher place on the federal courts of the United States. It will be a good \nday for America and a proud day for the people of Alabama who have seen \nher do well.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague from Mississippi, Senator Lott. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alabama, Mr. \nSessions, for his leadership on the Judiciary Committee and his \naggressive support for this fine nominee to serve in our Federal \njudiciary.\n  It is a great pleasure for me to rise today in support of the \nconfirmation of the Honorable Janice Rogers Brown to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the DC Circuit.\n  There are a lot of people who I would like to commend and \ncongratulate for bringing us to this point of justice for a very fine \nnominee to our Federal judiciary. We can be critical of how we reached \nthis point, the so-called compromise that was developed by the 14 \nSenators who came together. You can give credit to the leaders in both \nparties in certain respects. But the fact of the matter is the Senate \nvoted finally to give Justice Brown an up-or-down vote. I am proud of \nthat.\n  I think the Senate should take some pride and credit for allowing \nthis nominee to reach this point in the debate and in the voting \nprocess. I was pleased, yesterday, to see that 65 Senators voted to \ninvoke cloture to bring this nomination to an up-or-down recorded vote. \nSo a lot of people deserve credit, and I want to make sure they have \nit. I want to thank them for it.\n  I also want to ask for the forgiveness of this nominee for the way \nshe has been treated. I do not think this has been one of the Senate's \nproudest hours.\n  I think this nominee has such an outstanding personal story to be \ntold, and I will not repeat the history of where she was born and where \nshe was educated and what she has been through, but she has lived the \nAmerican dream, and she has lived it well. She did not just complain \nabout her status. She worked and got an education. She applied herself. \nShe has been given opportunities, and she has taken advantage of them.\n  I am proud to say I support her nomination. I think she will make an \nexcellent judge. I really do believe most opposition to her has just \nbeen simply the fact that she is an African-American conservative \nwoman. I do not think we should vote for or against judges because they \nare conservative, moderate, or liberal. I think we should vote on them \nbased on their background, their education, their experience, their \ndecorum. Do they have the ethics for the job? Do they have conflicts of \ninterest?\n  If they meet all of those qualifications, in my opinion, they should \nbe confirmed. That is what Presidential elections are about. They are \nabout electing men or women to that office who will nominate people to \nthe Federal judiciary who agree with their philosophy. When President \nClinton nominated people to the Supreme Court--and I have said this \nbefore, but I repeat it again--when he nominated Ruth Bader Ginsburg to \nthe Supreme Court, I knew I did not agree with her philosophy. I knew I \nwould not agree with many of her decisions in the Supreme Court. But \nshe was qualified by experience and by education, by every criteria \nthat we should evaluate, and I voted for her. I voted to confirm other \njudges whom I did not agree with philosophically.\n  There have been attacks on Justice Brown that she has a philosophy of \nlife, certain moral values, as though that is disqualifying. I do not \nunderstand that. Are we not entitled to our opinions, personal \nopinions, even as judges, let alone as Senators? We certainly have ours \nand express them routinely. I think judges have a right to have \npersonal and private lives and to be able to give a speech in which \nthey state positions which may not necessarily be reflected in reasoned \ndecisions as judges. You can have an opinion, but if the law is on the \nother side, you have to rule that way. There was a recent decision by a \nFederal district judge in my own State that I don't agree with, and I \nknow he doesn't agree with it personally. But he upheld the law in a \nvery reasoned decision. That is what has happened with Justice Brown. \nShe has strong beliefs based on her life experience, but she hasn't \ntried to impose those in an unfair way as a member of the California \nSupreme Court. Yet she is attacked--attacked relentlessly and, in my \nopinion, unfairly and inaccurately on many occasions.\n\n[[Page S6186]]\n\n  For instance, she has been attacked here for a quote in her dissent \nin Stevenson v. Huntington Memorial Hospital in which she distinguished \nage discrimination from race discrimination. Based on this quote, they \nsuggest Justice Brown doesn't believe in public policy against age \ndiscrimination. To draw this conclusion based on what Justice Brown \nwrote is as wrong as making the same accusation against the U.S. \nSupreme Court, which drew the same distinction in Massachusetts Board \nof Retirement v. Murgia, a case Justice Brown cited.\n  It should be added that both Justice Brown and our Nation's highest \ncourt are correct. All of us will eventually get old, and we have \nparents and grandparents. But most of us will never know what it is \nlike to be Black or Hispanic in America, to be pulled over for no \nreason other than your skin color, to have grandparents or parents who \ndid not get to go to college or even sit at the same lunch counter or \ndrink from the same water fountain.\n  These charges are totally out of line with other decisions that she \ncited and with her own life experience.\n  She has been attacked for opposing Social Security and Medicare as \nsocialist programs that should be reversed. This is completely untrue. \nNot a single opinion of hers suggests that she opposes these programs. \nIn fact, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee directly asked \nher whether she regards New Deal programs such as Social Security, \nlabor standards, and the Securities and Exchange Commission as \nsocialist, and she replied, unequivocally, ``no.'' Has she raised some \nquestions about some of those programs in her private speeches or even \nher public speeches? Perhaps so. I think it could be done on a \nprincipled and substantive basis. But, again, that doesn't disqualify \nher. If you look at the reasoning she has used while a member of the \nCalifornia Supreme Court, you will see that she cites the law and \nupholds the law. What she may have said in some speech should not \ndisqualify her.\n  Senators here have cited a list of interest groups who oppose Justice \nBrown. But consider this. She is on the Supreme Court in California, \nnot exactly a hot bed of conservatism or moderation. She was retained \nby the California voters by a margin of 76 percent of the vote, the \nhighest margin of the four California Supreme Court justices on the \nballot, six points higher than Stanley Mosk, a well-known liberal \njurist in the State, and higher than California's chief justice. The \npeople believe she is a good supreme court justice, qualified, and has \nbeen rational and moderate in her views on the supreme court, or they \nwouldn't have voted for her with 76 percent of the vote.\n  She has been attacked for her dissent in a case against companies \nthat sold cigarettes to children. The truth is, Justice Brown clearly \nwrote in her opinion that selling cigarettes to minors is against the \nlaw and those guilty of it should be punished.\n  To suggest that she did not feel this way is totally inaccurate. Yet \nthat has been said on the floor of the Senate during the days of debate \nwe have had.\n  There are some people who don't exactly share her views who have \nendorsed her. I read one newspaper column being very critical of her, \nsaying she should not be confirmed. But it went on to say that she has \nroutinely written the decisions of the court, that her decisions are \ninteresting, almost lyrical, and very professional. Yet you maintain in \nthe same column she is not qualified?\n  In fact, in a recent column, law professor Jonathan Turley, a self-\ndescribed pro-choice social liberal, points out that ``Brown's legal \nopinions show a willingness to vote against conservative views . . . \nwhen justice demands it'' and that Democrats should confirm her.\n  Even though Justice Brown has expressed personal opinions against too \nmuch government regulation, she has consistently voted to uphold \nregulations in every walk of life. You mean to tell me that you are \ndisqualified for the Federal judiciary if you think that there are too \nmany government regulations? I certainly believe there are. I would \nhope that we would have Federal judges that would quit compounding it \nby writing more and more regulations of their own.\n  Justice Brown joined in an opinion upholding the Safe Drinking Water \nand Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, and expansively interpreted the act \nto allow the plaintiffs to proceed with their clean water claims. \nJustice Brown upheld the right of plaintiffs to sue for exposure to \ntoxic chemicals using the Government's environmental regulations. \nJustice Brown upheld California's very stringent consumer safety \nstandards for identifying and labeling milk and milk products, thereby \nensuring that the government has a role in protecting the safety of our \nchildren and all Californians.\n  Justice Brown joined in an opinion validating State labor regulations \nregarding overtime pay. The list goes on and on and on.\n  I believe Justice Brown has been very unfairly charged. She is highly \nqualified. Some would even maintain she has been willing to take this \nabuse and to step down to this court that is not superior to the one on \nwhich she now sits. She has been willing to go through this crucible to \nbe confirmed. She should be confirmed. I am pleased to see a woman, a \nnominee of this caliber, with her American life story, be nominated. I \nbelieve, and I certainly hope, she will be confirmed. I think that \nhistory will prove that she will be an outstanding member of the \nFederal judiciary.\n  I ask unanimous consent to place further examples of rulings by \nJustice Brown in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       In Hamilton v. Asbestos Corp., she authored the court's \n     opinion on a statute of limitations issue that allowed an \n     injured plaintiff more time in which to file a personal \n     injury claim against various asbestos defendants.\n       In County of Riverside v. Superior Court, she wrote the \n     court's opinion holding that, under the Public Safety \n     Officers Procedural Bill of Rights, a peace officer is \n     entitled to view adverse comments in his personnel file and \n     file a written response to a background investigation of the \n     officer during probationary employment.\n       Ramirez v. Yosemite Water Company, she joined in the \n     court's opinion validating State regulations regarding \n     overtime pay.\n       In Pearl v. Workers Compensation Appeals Board, she upheld \n     the role of the Board in applying a stringent standard of \n     ``industrial causation'' for a worker's injury, validating \n     the state's role in ensuring worker safety.\n       And in McKown v. Wal-Mart Stores, she wrote, again for the \n     court's majority, that the employer of an independent \n     contractor is liable for injury to the independent \n     contractor's employee caused by the employer's negligent \n     provision of unsafe equipment.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak on behalf of a \nwoman I have never met, Janice Rogers Brown. I do so also to note the \ndelicious irony in the recent comments by the chairman of the \nDemocratic National Committee, former Governor Howard Dean. I am told \nthat yesterday Mr. Dean said:\n\n       Republicans are not very friendly to different kinds of \n     people. They are a pretty monolithic party, behave the same, \n     and they all look the same. You know, it is pretty much a \n     white Christian party.\n\n  The delicious irony is that we have been here arguing on behalf of an \nAfrican-American woman of great distinction for over 4 years. Other \nnames like Miguel Estrada come to mind, and the fights we have had to \nconfirm members to the Federal judiciary of all walks of life, of all \nkinds of diversity, of all kinds of hyphenations, if you will, who \nhappen to be Republicans, who happen to be conservatives, but certainly \nrepresent every race, every ethnic background, and every national \norigin. Yet the chairman of the Democratic National Committee would \nmake a statement like that. That is something that should not be missed \nby the American people.\n  I am not a terribly partisan person. I, frankly, think the American \npeople are deeply weary of all the partisan bickering and name calling. \nBut I also want to note the contrast of style between Chairman Dean and \nChairman Mehl-\nman of the Republican National Committee. Ken Mehlman has gone out of \nhis way to speak at African-American universities, to speak to all \nkinds of groups, to include them in the Republican Party.\n  I also want to make this comment. When I read the other day Chairman \nDean's saying ``I hate Republicans,'' I\n\n[[Page S6187]]\n\nwant to say that I do not hate Democrats. Some of the finest people in \nthis Chamber sit on that side of the aisle. They are my friends, as are \nmy Republican colleagues. This kind of hate speech really doesn't have \na productive place in our political discourse. It is important to \nrecognize the humanity of Republicans and Democrats and the diversity \nthat each party has as they try to include majorities of the American \npeople.\n  I, for one, am tired of the bravado. I am tired of the hyperbole. I \nam tired of the name calling. But I do want to say that we in the \nRepublican Party are trying to include people, women and minorities, \nwho have historically been kept out of public service and much of the \nbenefit of American law in our history. And I do not think that should \nbe condemned. I think that is to be celebrated when both parties do \nthat.\n  I, for one, see the Republican Party and our chairman doing that in a \ndramatic and constructive way. Chairman Dean's comments are not worthy \nof the great Democratic Party. I am not here to pick a fight with him, \nbut I do want to note that I and others, particularly on the Judiciary \nCommittee, have for a long time been waging the fight for an African-\nAmerican woman who deserves to be confirmed to the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  Any fair reading of Justice Brown has to remember that for over 25 \nyears she has provided public service through her legal skills. She has \nmost recently been a member of the California Supreme Court, since \n1996. She is the first African-American woman to sit on that court. \nPrior to her appointment to the California Supreme Court, she was an \nassociate justice of the California Court of Appeals. From 1991 to \n1994, she served as a legal affairs secretary to a former colleague of \nours from California, the former Governor Pete Wilson. Her office \nmonitored all significant State litigation and had general \nresponsibilities for acting as legal liaison between the Governor's \noffice and executive departments. She performed the heavy duties of her \noffice with unfailing fidelity. And Governor Wilson wrote in his letter \nto UCLA's nominating committee:\n\n       She often told me what I did not wish to hear.\n\n  In her 9 years on the California Supreme Court, Justice Brown has \nearned a solid reputation of being fair and competent in her \njurisprudence and as one who is committed to the rule of law. In fact, \nit needs to be said again and again what was written of her by 12 of \nher current and former colleagues in the California judiciary. It is a \nbipartisan group, as many Democrats as Republicans. They wrote:\n\n       Much has been written about Justice Brown's humble \n     beginnings, and the story of her rise to the California \n     Supreme Court is truly compelling. But that alone would not \n     be enough to gain our endorsement for a seat on the federal \n     bench. We believe that Justice Brown is qualified because she \n     is a superb judge. We have worked with her on a daily basis \n     and know her to be extremely intelligent, keenly analytical, \n     and very hard working. We know that she is a jurist who \n     applies the law without favor and without bias, and with an \n     even hand.\n\n  It is notable what many of her colleagues have said before. She was \nborn in 1949 in Alabama to sharecroppers. She attended segregated \nschools and came of age in the midst of Jim Crow laws. Jim Crow laws \nwere not a product of Republicans.\n  Janice Rogers Brown, however, is a conservative. Some conservatives, \nof course, have stated that she is more of a libertarian than a \nconservative. But I guess that is bad enough as far as liberal \nDemocrats are concerned. At the heart of her judicial philosophy is the \nnotion that property rights and economic liberty deserve judicial \nprotection.\n  In an opinion on a California rent control ordinance, Justice Brown \nstated in her dissent:\n\n     . . . arbitrary government actions which infringe property \n     interests cannot be saved from constitutional infirmity by \n     the beneficial purposes of the regulators.\n\n  That is, the government and politicians cannot arbitrarily take away \na person's right to property for the ``common good.''\n  Critics charge that Brown will be unable to separate her personal \nideology and philosophy from judicial rulings.\n  Justice Brown has stated:\n\n       I do recognize the difference in the role between speaking \n     and being a judge.''\n\n  I urge the confirmation of this distinguished African-American woman \nand ask my colleagues to support her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Janice Rogers Brown should not be \nconfirmed to the D.C. Circuit. I listened to the eloquent statement of \nmy friend from Oregon. This is not an issue where we are voting on a \nlife story. What we are talking about is a vote for a nominee to the \nD.C. Circuit and whether that person's votes will be consistent with \nour constitutional values and will that person have an understanding of \nthe very special role the D.C. Circuit has in interpreting the laws \nwhich have been passed by the Congress and which are subject to the \nD.C. Circuit Court's interpretation. That is enormously important \nbecause there are so many of those laws that provide important \nprotections--for example, OSHA legislation and whether we are going to \nhave safe working conditions for workers.\n  As a result of the passage of the OSHA legislation, across this \ncountry we have seen a reduction in the number of deaths of workers in \nplants and factories and construction reduced by half. We have made \nprogress. There are those forces who want to weaken OSHA because many \nof the companies believe the penalties under OSHA are a cost of doing \nbusiness, and this puts workers at risk.\n  These very important legal issues and questions interpreting the \nlegislation which we have passed and have updated are the same ones \nthat will come to the D.C. Circuit.\n  As impressive as the life of this nominee is, if we are really \ninterested in what is going to happen in the D.C. Circuit as it affects \nconstitutional rights and liberties, as well as legislative actions we \nhave taken, it is fair to insist that the person who is nominated is \ngoing to have a core commitment to the constitutional values and also a \nhealthy respect for actions that have been taken by Republicans and \nDemocrats and legislation that has been signed by the President. Using \neither of those standards, this nomination fails. I wish to take a few \nmoments to elaborate on that issue.\n  The D.C. Circuit is widely considered the second most important court \nin the country after the Supreme Court. It is the court that most \nclosely oversees the actions of Federal agencies, and its duty is to \ngive a fair hearing in cases on governmental protections, environmental \nlaws, civil rights, workers' rights, and on public health and safety. \nNominees to this important court should have a clear commitment to \nupholding the law in these areas. And Janice Rogers Brown's record \nshows not only that she lacks the commitment but that she is hostile to \nany form of governmental action.\n  Although located here in the District of Columbia, the D.C. Circuit \naffects all Americans because its decisions have broad national impact. \nSome cases, such as those involving review of national air quality \nstandards under the Clean Air Act and national drinking water standards \nunder the Safe Drinking Water Act, can only be heard in the D.C. \nCircuit.\n  In this country over the last 4 years, we have doubled the deaths of \nasthmatic children in this Nation. Why? I think we can point to it: \nbecause of the relaxation and the change in the Clean Air Act and the \nrelaxation of rules and regulations. As a result of that, children in \ndownwind States from a lot of these companies that are burning toxins \nhave experienced a dramatic increase in breathing difficulty and in \nasthma deaths. That is directly attributable to the change in the rules \nand regulations of the Clean Air Act. When there are new rules and \nregulations to the Clean Air Act and they are challenged, they go to \nthe D.C. Circuit. The D.C. Circuit makes a judgment that will have a \ndirect impact, for example, on whether your child or children may very \nwell have enhanced problems with asthma.\n  I have a chronic asthmatic son who happens also to be a Congressman. \nI follow this issue very closely. I know what has been developing over \nrecent times in terms of the relaxation of the Clean Air Act. We can \ndirectly attribute that to the relaxation of rules and regulations. \nThose judgments and decisions are made virtually jointly by\n\n[[Page S6188]]\n\nthe administration with Executive orders and, secondly, by the D.C. \nCircuit. That is illustrative of the range of different issues that \ncome before the D.C. Circuit Court.\n\n  Some cases, such as those involving the review of national air \nquality standards under the Clean Water Act and the national drinking \nwater standards under the Safe Drinking Water Act, can only be heard in \nthe D.C. Circuit. We know about the dramatic increase in mercury that \nis taking place in streams all across this country. It has had a \ndevastating impact on the fish and the ecosystems of so many of the \nrivers. That has been ingested. It provides an important health hazard \nfor expectant mothers. Those happen to be the health implications as a \nresult of individuals who do not have a strong commitment to issues \ninvolving the clean drinking water legislation that has been passed by \nthe Congress.\n  This court also hears the lion's share of cases involving rights of \nemployees under the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the National \nLabor Relations Act. As a practical matter, because the Supreme Court \ncan only review a small number of these lower decisions, the judges in \nthe D.C. Circuit often have the last word on these important rights.\n  Other cases end up in the D.C. Circuit because the party bringing the \nappeal is allowed to choose to have the case heard there. That is true, \nfor instance, in appeals of the National Labor Relations Board \ninvolving fair working conditions. So people from California to \nAlabama, Texas to Massachusetts, often find their cases decided by the \nD.C. Circuit.\n  Janice Rogers Brown has said that where government moves in, \ncommunity retreats, and civil society disintegrates. She has said that \ngovernment leads to families under siege, war in the streets. In her \nview, `` . . . when government advances . . . freedom is imperiled \n[and] civilization itself jeopardized.''\n  Her actions on the California Supreme Court match her words. Time and \nagain she has struck down basic protections. Her supporters try to \nexplain away her record. They say she is conservative but well within \nthe mainstream of conservative thought. But that is not credible. \nMainstream does not mean extreme, except possibly in George Orwell's \ndictionary.\n  Even George Will, the well-known conservative columnist, has admitted \nthat Janice Rogers Brown is out of the mainstream. She does not belong \non any court, much less the second most important court in the land.\n  President Bush has often said that he wants to appoint judges who \nwill strictly follow settled law, not judges who will legislate from \nthe bench. But Janice Rogers Brown is exactly that sort of judicial \nlegislator. In fact, when she joined the California Supreme Court, the \nCalifornia State Bar Judicial Nominees Evaluation Commission had rated \nher ``not qualified'' based not only on her lack of experience but also \nbecause she was specifically ``prone to inserting conservative \npolitical views into her appellate opinions'' and was ``insensitive to \nestablished precedent.''\n  Since joining the California Supreme Court, she has written opinions \nstating that judges should not follow settled law if they disagree with \nit. She has said that judicial activism is not troubling, per se; what \nmatters is the world view of judicial activists. As one conservative \ncommentator in the National Review pointed out, ``if a liberal nominee \n. . . said similar things, conservatives would make short work of \nher.''\n  Last month, the D.C. Circuit decided several claims of \ndiscrimination. Yet Janice Rogers Brown has issued opinions that would \nhave prevented victims of age and race discrimination from obtaining \nrelief in State court. She dissented a holding that victims of \ndiscrimination may obtain damages from administrative agencies for \ntheir emotional distress. She has questioned whether age discrimination \nlaws benefit the public.\n  Her record on civil rights is so abysmal that her nomination is \nopposed by respected civil rights leaders such as Julian Bond, chairman \nof the NAACP, and Rev. Joseph Lowrey, president emeritus of the \nSouthern Christian Leadership Conference who worked with Dr. Martin \nLuther King, Jr., in the civil rights movement and who has fought \ntirelessly for many years to make civil rights a reality for all \nAmericans.\n  Her nomination is also opposed by the Congressional Black Caucus, the \nLeadership Conference on Civil Rights, the National Bar Association, \nthe Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, the California Association of \nBlack Lawyers, the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, the second oldest \nsorority of African-American women. Her nomination is opposed by \nDorothy Height, president emeritus of the National Council of Negro \nWomen, who last year received a Congressional Gold Medal for her \nservice to the Nation.\n  Justice Brown should not be given the chance to rule on \ndiscrimination cases on the Nation's second most important court.\n  In May, the D.C. Circuit decided the cases of two retirees seeking \nretirement benefits. Yet Janice Rogers Brown has said that senior \ncitizens cannibalize their grandchildren by seeking support from \nsociety in their old age. Do we want a judge such as that on the D.C. \nCircuit deciding claims for retirement benefits?\n  Last month, the D.C. Circuit also decided a case involving Social \nSecurity benefits for a widow and her children. But Janice Rogers Brown \nhas called the New Deal which created Social Security the triumph of a \nsocialistic revolution. Do we really believe she will deal fairly with \nclaims involving Social Security if she is confirmed to the D.C. \nCircuit?\n  We have confirmed over 200 of President Bush's nominees. Almost all \nof them were confirmed with Democratic support. Almost all of them were \nvery conservative. But there is a difference between being \nconservative, as those nominees were, and being committed to rolling \nback basic rights, which is what Janice Rogers Brown's record clearly \nshows.\n  There are many well-qualified Republican lawyers who would be quickly \nconfirmed, but the President has selected Janice Rogers Brown, who is \nclearly hostile to the very laws the D.C. Circuit is required to \nenforce. In doing so, the President has guaranteed that the Senate \nwould spend many weeks dealing with this controversial nomination.\n  Many people across the Nation are wondering why judicial nominations \nhave recently consumed so much of our time in the Senate. Why have we \nseen so many more battles over judicial nominations than in other \nyears? The truth is that there would be no need to spend so much time \non nominations if the President picked mainstream nominees. Nominees \ncould be more quickly confirmed if the President returned to the \ntradition of consulting with Republican and Democratic Members of \nCongress about them.\n  The bipartisan agreement by our 14 Senate colleagues on the nuclear \noption emphasized that the word ``advice'' in the Constitution speaks \nto consultation between the Senate and the President with regard to the \nuse of the President's power to make nominations. The Federal courts \nare not supposed to decide cases to please special interests that have \ninfluence with the party in power. The courts do not belong to either \nparty, Republican or Democrat. Americans expect, and deserve, judges \nwho will treat everyone fairly and decide cases based on the law, not \ntheir own ideology. The only way to ensure that result is for \nPresidents to consult with both parties in the Senate before selecting \na nominee.\n  We have spent endless hours, dozens of days, too many weeks debating \nradical judges and Republican attempts to abuse power. Meanwhile, look \nwhat is happening to the strength and the security of this country. Our \nmilitary forces are protecting America amidst a growing insurgency and \nincreasingly dangerous conditions. Our men and women in uniform need \narmored humvees and electronic jammers for protection against roadside \nexplosives in Iraq.\n  It is unconscionable that month after month the Pentagon kept sending \nmen and women on patrol without proper equipment. The Defense \nauthorization bill will provide $344 million for up-armored humvees and \narmor kits and $500 million for electronic jammers. This money should \nbe approved without delay. But there is a judgment and decision by the \nRepublican leadership that we are going to spend more time on these \njudges that are so far out of\n\n[[Page S6189]]\n\nthe mainstream, that are in the extreme in terms of their views about \nconstitutional principles and values.\n  We know that this body should be finishing. If we are going to be \nfinishing the work on judges this week, we should then be proceeding to \nthe Defense authorization bill. The House of Representatives has \ncompleted it. Although the appropriators for the appropriations for the \nDefense authorization bill have not completed work, generally, that is \nthe first appropriations bill that we consider. Generally, that is the \nlegislation that passes here in the month of July. But, no, it has been \nthe judgment and decision that we are going to spend more time on these \njudges who are clearly out of the mainstream. Mr. President, 96 percent \nof the judges have been approved, but it is the judgment of the \nPresident and the majority here that we are going to debate these \njudges who are clearly out of the mainstream of judicial thinking.\n  It is a question of priorities. It does seem to me this Nation is \nbetter served if we have judges in the mainstream of judicial thinking, \nthat we give them the consideration, that we give them the approval, as \nwe have on the 95 percent of those who have already been approved, and \nthen be considering the Defense authorization bill--which is a \npriority. It is a priority not only getting it passed so the \nconferences can make progress, but it is an indication of our \npriorities, and it sends a message to our troops, as well, overseas and \nto the American people as to what we believe is important. Now that we \nhave effectively spent all this time, these weeks, on judges who are so \noutside the mainstream--now we are going to be considering an Energy \nbill next week, not the Defense authorization bill. I think that is the \nwrong decision and the wrong priority.\n  Our citizens want lives of opportunity and fulfillment for themselves \nand their children. They wonder how they can afford the massive tuition \ncost increases that are putting college beyond the reach of so many \nstudents. If the President consulted with the Senate on judicial \nnominees, as the Constitution anticipates, and which any fair reading \nof the Constitutional Convention would indicate, we could be working on \nproblems such as that. It is interesting reading about the \nConstitutional Convention. We find, for the great majority of the time \nof the Federal Constitutional Convention, the decision of the Founding \nFathers was to give the Senate the complete authority for naming \nFederal judges and approving them. In the last few days, the last 8 \ndays of the Constitutional Convention, they decided that the power \nshould be shared and divided.\n  In sharing that power, we exercise our judgment, as Members of the \nSenate, whether we believe these nominees are committed to the values \nof the Constitution. That is what is tested with these nominees. If we \nwere not considering these nominees who are clearly outside the \nmainstream, we would have a chance to consider the Defense \nauthorization bill, and we would have a chance to perhaps debate why it \nis hundreds of thousands of young children of the middle class struggle \nto pay student loans? Student loans are guaranteed by the Federal \nGovernment, but because of a policy of the Department of Education, the \nloan companies are subsidized at a 9.5 percent rate of return. Why \naren't we debating that? It can make a difference to the cost of \neducation, to working families and middle-income families. Do you think \nthat is on our agenda? No, that is not on our agenda. We can't consider \nthat.\n  We can't consider the Defense authorization bill. We are only going \nto be considering the qualifications of judges who are out of the \nmainstream of judicial thinking.\n  Countless Americans are lying awake at night, wondering how they can \nafford their health insurance as their premiums constantly go up, year \nafter year. Just today, Families USA released a report that $1,000 of \nyour insurance premium, that is the average premiums Americans are \npaying--$1,000 comes out of your pocket because we refuse to act on the \nchallenges of health insurance for average working Americans. We are \nnot debating that. We are not discussing it. We refuse to consider it. \nNo, we are right back to where we are in considering these \ncontroversial judges.\n  Here is Families USA: Every American ought to know they are paying \n$1,000 on their health insurance because someone else is not covered. \nWe have seen the constant number of uninsured go up. So, America, wake \nup. Your health insurance costs are going to continue to go up, and we \nsee more Americans losing their health insurance. Don't we think that \nis a national problem? Don't we think that is something we ought to be \ndebating here in the Senate? No, that is not a priority. We are \ndebating these controversial judges.\n  The working families of this country, the struggling middle class, is \nconcerned about the decline in their standard of living. They have \nworked hard all their lives, but they keep facing rising prices, jobs \nthat could disappear tomorrow and less secure retirement. They want to \npay their bills, put a little aside for tomorrow, but that is harder \nand harder to do. This article says that General Motors just laid off \n25,000. They will reduce hourly workers by 25,000. Plant closings seen. \nPlants hope to avoid layoffs in the biggest cutback since 1992.\n  Why aren't we doing something about this, this afternoon? Why aren't \nwe debating what we ought to be doing to help those families? Can you \nimagine being one of the members of those families who had worked 10, \n20, or 30 years and found out you are one of those 25,000 families?\n  No one is suggesting there is a quick, easy solution to it, but it is \na problem, and it is a challenge. Just as we heard yesterday in our \nHuman Resource Committee about the issue of pensions--you could not \npick up your newspaper across America yesterday and not find out about \nunfunded pension plans in the airlines. The guaranty agency, the PBGC \nagency which is to guarantee these pensions, is $23 billion in deficit, \nwith the prospect of additional airlines going into bankruptcy and the \nairlines dropping all those individuals where they will not get nearly \nwhat they have sacrificed for and paid into retirement. Don't you think \nthat is important enough that we ought to be debating that issue, \ntalking about that here on the floor of the Senate? Isn't that a \npriority for hundreds of thousands or millions of Americans? It \ncertainly should be. It is in my State. But, oh, no, let's talk about \nJanice Rogers Brown.\n  Let's talk about William Pryor, who has an absolute disdain for the \nvoting rights bill. He has a disdain for the Americans with Disability \nAct. I have been here. My friend Tom Harkin and others, in a bipartisan \nway, we passed that Americans with Disabilities Act with the leadership \nwe had with Bob Dole. Read the opinions of Mr. Pryor about that. He has \nan absolute contempt for the Congress in the way he addressed the \nAmericans With Disabilities Act. We are going to be spending days to \nmake sure the American people understand and know what Mr. Pryor said \nabout the Americans With Disabilities Act, let alone what he said about \nvoting rights, let alone what he said about family and medical leave. \nThat is something which millions of families take advantage of--not \npaid family leave, but just emergency family leave to be able to go \nback and take care of a sick child or a sick parent. Not according to \nMr. Pryor.\n  But, nonetheless, Republicans and this President sent this nominee up \nhere, and it is important for us to be able to explain to the American \npeople why we are opposed to that nominee. But they chose to nominate. \nThey send the nominee. That is the President, he has that authority. He \nsends them up here when they are controversial, the other side supports \nit, we explain what our position is, they threaten to close us down and \nmuzzle us and gag us by changing the rules in midstream--which we have \nfortunately been able to resist here. But all of that is a higher \npriority for the other side, for this administration, than to consider \nthese workers who have been laid off; pension plans which are of such \nimportance; the escalating costs we find out today for students in the \nmiddle class in terms of education--that is the failure of this \ninstitution at this time.\n\n  Oliver Wendell Holmes said we must be involved in the actions or \npassions of our times or risk not to have lived. What is involved in \nthe actions and passions of the times, certainly for these 25,000 \nworkers, is the fact they are not going to go to work. For the \nretirees, the millions, what is involved in\n\n[[Page S6190]]\n\ntheir actions and passions is their retirement program. And for all \nAmericans, when they are paying an additional $1,000, which they should \nnot be paying, and we are doing nothing about it. They care about that. \nThose are issues which they care about. The middle class is paying \ndramatically more than they should, in terms of the interest on student \nloans, than they should or need to. We ought to be debating those \nissues, but we are not able to do so because that is not the priority \nof this administration or this Senate.\n  Democrats would like nothing better than to turn to other issues \nrather than debate this controversial nomination. But we know that the \nwork we do in Congress to improve health care, reform public schools, \nprotect working families and enforce civil rights, is undermined if we \nfail in our responsibility to provide the best possible advice and \nconsent on judicial nominations.\n  Needed environmental laws mean little to a community that cannot \nenforce them in the Federal courts. Fair labor laws and civil rights \nlaws mean little if we confirm judges who ignore them.\n  Deciding who is confirmed to the D.C. Circuit is too important to \nignore. The important work we do in Congress on all of these and other \nissues is undermined if we fail in our responsibility to provide the \nbasic advice and consent on judicial nominations. Basic rights and \nimportant laws mean little if we confirm judges who ignore them.\n  I want to wind up with a headline of today in the Washington Post. \nHere it is: ``Tobacco Escapes Huge Penalty. U.S. Seeks $10 Billion \nInstead of $130 Billion.''\n  The $130 billion was the recommendation of the professional lawyers \nin the Justice Department. The political lawyers in the Justice \nDepartment recommended $10 billion. That is according to the news \nreports. We know historically that former Attorney General Ashcroft did \nnot want to bring the case, but nonetheless the case was brought. The \nrecommendation by the Government attorneys was for $130 billion but, oh \nno, the political lawyers evidently, according to the news reports, won \nthe day and the amount recommended was for $10 billion. Even the \ntobacco companies were amazed.\n  What was that $130 billion going to be used for? That $130 billion \nwas going to be used for smoking cessation to get them to stop smoking, \nto stop them from the addiction of nicotine. An important impact can be \nmade in terms of stopping children from being involved with tobacco and \ncancer, especially lung cancer, but, no, the Department said: We want \njust $10 billion.\n  We ought to be debating that issue. We ought to be finding out--has \nmy time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The next half hour is allocated to the Senator from New \nYork; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the Chair's understanding.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent to be able to proceed on Senator \nSchumer's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I know my friend from New York is on his way, but that \npoint should not be lost. Here we have just within the last several \ndays an issue that can make such a difference to every parent in this \ncountry who has a teenage child. Every single day, 4,000 children start \nto smoke, and 2,000 become addicted. We have the opportunity with this \njudgment to have a major national program to discourage young children \nfrom going into it, and the Government says: No, we are going to go for \nnot even a slap on the wrist.\n  We have evidence today about the increase in the cost of health \ninsurance by more than $1,000 a year. That is something families \nunderstand. We have the increased cost of education. That is something \nfamilies understand.\n  Then there are the pension problems of workers who have worked and \ncontributed to their pensions over the years, and they are now \nvirtually evaporating. These are real issues of real people. But, no, \nthe President and the Republicans want us to spend our time on these \ncontroversial judges that fail to meet the fundamental requirement of \ncore commitment to the values of the Constitution and the understanding \nof the legislative process which protects the lives, the well-being, \nand the future of our country and families in this Nation.\n  For all of those reasons, this nominee should be rejected, and we \nought to get about the country's business and get away from these \ncontroversial judges who are clearly outside of the mainstream of \njudicial thinking.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that the time that was allocated \nto Senator Feinstein from 1:30 to 2 be allocated to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am here once again to debate whether \nJanice Rogers Brown deserves to be placed on the D.C. Court of Appeals. \nI have been very actively involved in this issue. I could not feel more \nstrongly about a nominee to the bench. I could not feel more strongly \nabout whether somebody belongs on the bench than Janice Rogers Brown.\n  We know for a fact that she is intelligent. We know she is \narticulate. We know she is accomplished and we know she is passionate. \nI respect every one of those qualities. She has a particular world \nview. She is not shy about it. It is apparent in her speeches, it is \napparent in her opinions, and it is apparent from her testimony before \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  Were she to be elected to the Senate, I would relish the opportunity \nto debate the merits of the various laws she might introduce because if \none looks at her writings, it is pretty clear. She well might introduce \nlegislation to repeal Social Security. She well might introduce \nlegislation to erase child labor laws. She well might introduce \nlegislation to eliminate workplace safety laws. She well might \nintroduce a bill to abolish zoning laws because in all of her speeches \nand opinions she has stood for these things.\n  Were she a Senator, she would no doubt be a passionate champion of a \nfar right legislative agenda, and that would be her mandate. That is \nclearly what she believes. That would be her right. She would be free \nto legislate to her heart's content. That is our job as Senators.\n  Were she a legislator she could not only continue to fulminate, as \nshe has, about the New Deal being a triumph of our socialist \nrevolution, she could actually introduce legislation to overturn it. \nWere she a legislator, she could not only vilify, as she has, ``senior \ncitizens who blithely cannibalize their grandchildren because they have \na right to get free stuff,'' she could introduce legislation to \neliminate benefits for the elderly.\n  Were she a legislator, she could not only say, as she has, that \n``where government moves in, community retreats, and civil society \ndisintegrates,'' she could actually introduce legislation to erase \nenvironmental laws, worker protection laws, minimum wage laws and other \nlaws that have protected a wide swath of American people for decades, \nsome even centuries.\n  Janice Rogers Brown is not a legislator, although sometimes she plays \nthat role. She has been nominated to the bench, not elected to the \nSenate.\n  I cannot put it any better than conservative commentator Andrew \nSullivan, who said that given her judicial activism, ``Janice Rogers \nBrown should run for office, not the courts.''\n  Now, that is a conservative columnist who is hitting the nail on the \nhead. It is not her views he opposes, it is, rather, the means by which \nshe will attempt to impose those views on the American people, through \nthe courts.\n  So while Janice Rogers Brown is smart, passionate, and articulate, \nJanice Rogers Brown is also hands down the worst nominee put forward by \nPresident Bush. She wants to make law, not interpret law. I thought \nthat was what mainstream Democrats and mainstream Republicans alike \nwanted to avoid on the bench at all costs.\n  I have been asking a question on the floor for the last several days. \nHow can moderates, or moderate conservatives, support Janice Rogers \nBrown when she does not meet any of the criteria they claim a judge \nmust meet? Is she a strict constructionist? No. When it suits her. Is \nshe a judicial activist? Yes, whenever she wants to find a result that \nmeets her world view. Is she\n\n[[Page S6191]]\n\nout of the mainstream of even conservative thinking? It seems pretty \nobvious she is.\n  I have yet to hear a good answer from my colleagues about why they \nwould vote for her. It should not be her history. It is an admirable \nhistory, but that is not why we place people on the bench.\n  I have heard a lot of rhetoric, I have heard a lot of tortured \nexplanations, I have heard a lot of selective citations, and I have \nheard a lot of smokescreens. But you know what I have not heard. Little \nof what I have heard is a real response to the substance of comments \nmade by distinguished conservative thinkers, not statements by Dick \nDurbin, Ted Kennedy, Harry Reid, or Chuck Schumer but by vocal \nconservatives, about Janice Rogers Brown.\n  My friend from Utah, Senator Hatch, said on this floor yesterday: \nOver the years, I have grown accustomed to talking points of Brown's \nliberal opposition. I think I have committed some of them to memory \nnow. Some liberal elitists charge she is extreme. Some liberal elitists \ncharge she is out of the mainstream. Some liberal elitists charge she \nis a radical conservative.\n  Liberal elitists? Let us take a look at the record of some of the \nliberal elitists the Senator from Utah so disdains.\n  Here is National Review writer, Ramesh Ponnuru, a very conservative \nwriter. He says:\n\n       Republicans, and their conservative allies, have been \n     willing to make . . . lame arguments to rescue even nominees \n     whose jurisprudence is questionable. Janice Rogers Brown . . \n     . has argued that there is properly an ``extra-constitutional \n     dimension to constitutional law.'' She has said that judges \n     should be willing to invoke a higher law than the \n     Constitution.\n\n  That is from the National Review--let me repeat, the National Review. \nHow many liberal elitists make their living writing for the National \nReview?\n  Here is more from the National Review: Janice Rogers Brown has said \nthat judicial activism is not troubling per se. What matters is the \nworld view of the judicial activist.\n  Or how about George Will? Is he a liberal elitist, I ask my friend \nfrom Utah? Is he out of the mainstream? Well, he thinks Janice Rogers \nBrown is. He says that Janice Rogers Brown is out of the mainstream of \neven conservative jurisprudence. Maybe someone can tell me when George \nWill became a liberal elitist. Here is what he said:\n\n       Janice Rogers Brown is out of that mainstream [of even \n     conservative jurisprudence] . . . It is a fact. She has \n     expressed admiration for the Supreme Court's pre-1937 hyper-\n     activism in declaring unconstitutional many laws and \n     regulations of the sort that now define the post-New Deal \n     regulatory State.\n\n  Which mainstream was he talking about? George Will wrote that she was \nout of the mainstream of conservative jurisprudence.\n  How can somebody who calls the New Deal a socialist revolution be \nmainstream?\n  Or listen to the words of conservative writer Andrew Sullivan. He is \nsuch a Brown-bashing liberal elitist that he actually agrees with many \nof Justice Brown's views. He said there is a case to be made for ``the \nconstitutional extremism of one of the President's favorite nominees, \nJanice Rogers Brown. Whatever else she is, she does not fit the \ndescription of a judge who simply applies the law. If she isn't a \n`judicial activist' I do not know who would be.''\n  Sullivan also stated: I might add, I am not unsympathetic to her \nviews, but she should run for office, not for the courts.\n  It is not the liberal elitists but thinking conservatives, \nremembering the principles that used to guide conservatives in picking \njudges, who are pointing out Janice Rogers Brown's shortcomings. What \nwe really have on the other side by some is opportunism. Abandon the \nview of what a judicial activist should be. Abandon the view of what a \nstrict constructionist should be. We like her views. We are supporting \nher. There has not been anyone like Janice Rogers Brown to come before \nus in a very long time. A conservative nominee, if the rhetoric from \nthe President and the Republican leaders is to be believed, must be at \nleast three things: a strict constructionist, judicially restrained, \nand mainstream.\n\n  We have not seen a more activist judge nominated than Janice Rogers \nBrown. We have not seen a judge who believes less in judicial restraint \nthan Janice Rogers Brown. We have not seen a judge nominated more out \nof the mainstream than Janice Rogers Brown.\n  She is not a strict constructionist. When it came to proposition 209, \nshe said she should ``look to the analytical and philosophical \nevolution of the interpretation and application of Title VII to develop \nthe historical context behind'' proposition 209. That is not the legal \nanalysis you would expect from a strict constructionist.\n  Is Janice Rogers Brown a dependable warrior against the scourge of \nconservatives everywhere--judicial activism? No, there has not been a \nnominee to the bench who is more a judicial activist than Janice Rogers \nBrown. Her own words demonstrate that she is quick to want to reverse \nprecedent, the very definition of an activist judge.\n  Time and time again, she has jumped at the chance to reshape settled \nlaw. She said:\n\n       We cannot simply cloak ourselves in the doctrine of stare \n     decisis.\n\n  That was in People v. Braverman in 1998. That is anathema to the \nwhole way judges make law. Stare decisis, looking at previous cases, is \nthe governing principle; strict constructionists believe in it more \nthan anyone else.\n  Again, I repeat this comment and I will be incredulous if people--\nparticularly moderates or those who claim to want to uphold \nconservative judicial principles--can vote for her:\n\n       We cannot simply cloak ourselves in the doctrine of stare \n     decisis.\n\n  She also said she was ``disinclined to perpetuate dubious law for no \nbetter reason than it exists,'' People v. Williams.\n\n       The commercial speech doctrine needs and deserves \n     reconsideration, and this is as good a place as any to begin.\n\n  That was Kasky v. Nike, 2002.\n  Here is what the California State bar judicial nominees said, who \ngave her a ``not qualified'' rating when she was nominated to the \nsupreme court in 1996: She was ``insensitive to established legal \nprecedent.''\n  Again, the record shows the President has not nominated a judge more \nactivist than Janice Rogers Brown. The President has not nominated a \njudge more out of the mainstream than Janice Rogers Brown. The \nPresident has not nominated a judge who has less respect for judicial \nrestraint than Janice Rogers Brown.\n  Some of her views are so far out of the mainstream that for my \ncolleague to compare Justice Ginsburg to Janice Rogers Brown is \nlaughable. Let's remember how Justice Ginsburg was approved. Senator \nHatch was called by Bill Clinton. Senator Hatch researched Justice \nGinsburg and said she would be acceptable.\n  Has President Bush called anyone and asked about Janice Rogers Brown? \nNo. If I were President Bush, I would not want to because the answer \nthey would get back would be clear: She does not belong on the bench.\n  Let me give another example. If you ask most lawyers to name the \nworst Supreme Court cases of the 20th century, Lochner would be near \nthe top of every list. But Justice Brown thinks it is correctly \ndecided. That is a decision in 1905. Does that place her in the \nmainstream?\n  She described the New Deal as a triumph of America's socialist \nrevolution. Does that place her in the mainstream?\n  On another occasion, she said:\n\n       Today's senior citizens blithely cannibalize their \n     grandchildren because they have a right to get as much `free' \n     stuff as the political system will permit them to extract.\n\n  Does that place her in the mainstream?\n  In another instance she wrote:\n\n       Where government moves in, community retreats, civil \n     society disintegrates, and our ability to control our own \n     destiny atrophies.\n\n  Does that place her in the mainstream?\n  Janice Rogers Brown is so far out of the mainstream she cannot even \nsee the shoreline. Janice Rogers Brown, as George Will has correctly \npointed out, may be many things, but she is not even in the mainstream \nof conservative jurisprudence.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side have said, well, she is being \nunfairly attacked because of a few ``musings'' and ``extra judicial'' \ncomments. At her hearing, Justice Brown herself made the point we \nshould view her speeches separately from her judicial opinions. A \nlittle defensive, I would say.\n  Let's compare her speeches and her judicial opinions. In a speech to \nthe\n\n[[Page S6192]]\n\nFederalist Society, Justice Brown compared the end of the Lochner era \nto a socialist revolution. Her words: ``socialist revolution.''\n  She distances herself from that comparison by saying that it was part \nof a speech made to a young audience designed to ``stir the pot.'' I \nthink that is a pretty radical comment for any sitting judge to make in \nany context, even if it is designed to stir debate.\n  But I am not satisfied it is just her personal view and has no \nbearing on her judicial opinions because time and time again what she \nsays in these speeches is repeated in her opinions.\n  In Santa Monica Beach v. Superior Court she called the demise of the \nLochner era the ``revolution of 1937.'' That is nearly identical to \nwhat she said in the Federalist Society speech.\n  Is this what she is going to do when she is on the court? Stir the \npot?\n  It is not the only example. Here is another. She was asked about a \nspeech given to the Institute of Justice where she said:\n\n       If we can invoke no ultimate limits on the powers of \n     government, a democracy is inevitably transformed into a \n     Kleptocracy--a license to steal, a warrant for oppression.\n\n  She dismissed that speech saying it does not reflect necessarily her \nviews as a judge.\n  But in San Remo v. City and County of San Francisco, she said, \nregarding a planning ordinance:\n\n       Turning a democracy into a Kleptocracy does not enhance the \n     stature of thieves; it only diminishes the legitimacy of \n     government.\n\n  Her views as a private citizen, and her views as a judge seem to be, \nunfortunately, quite the same. It couldn't be more obvious. She cannot \nexplain how virtually identical rhetoric that many would call extreme \nfinds its way into both her speeches and her judicial opinions.\n  I will go back to my friend from Kentucky, Senator McConnell. He drew \na comparison in support of Janice Rogers Brown. He said, like Janice \nRogers Brown, Ruth Bader Ginsburg had made some provocative comments \nearly in her career, but she was confirmed by her Senate.\n  I say to my colleague from Texas: Senator, I know Ruth Bader \nGinsburg. Ruth Bader Ginsburg is a friend of mine. Janice Rogers Brown \nis no Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n  Justice Ginsburg established such a record of moderation on the D.C. \nCircuit Court of Appeals that President Clinton was able to nominate \nher after getting advice from Senator Hatch that she was a mainstream \nliberal.\n  No one expects our President to nominate liberal nominees. They are \ngoing to be conservative. We have supported these conservatives up and \ndown the line. Now the number is 209 out of 219 because, with the \napproval of Priscilla Owen, we have no longer blocked 10. When someone \nis out of the mainstream, that is when we oppose them.\n  In the end, what does the record show about Janice Rogers Brown? Not \nthe rhetoric, not the smokescreens. Again, I challenge my colleagues to \ndiscuss her record, not dismiss it, saying it is just rhetorical. How \ncan anyone justify a record such as this?\n  Here is what Janice Rogers Brown's record shows. She is not strict in \nher construction. She is not mainstream in her conservatism. She is not \nquiet about her activism.\n  So I am left with the same question: Why is Janice Rogers Brown \ntouted as the model conservative judge when she is anything but \nconservative in her judicial approach? There are many Senators from \nacross the aisle who would vote against such a candidate because her \njudicial philosophy could not be more out of sync with theirs. But I \nworry that there is enormous political pressure from a few way-off-the-\ntop groups, the Senators from the other side.\n  Here is the chart that shows the pressure. These are the ``yes'' \nvotes for court of appeals nominees and ``yes'' votes for cloture on \nthem compared to the ``no'' votes. Of all my Republican colleagues, \nevery vote tabulated, 2,811 times did our Republican colleagues vote \nyes; twice did they vote no. One of those was the Presiding Officer who \nvoted against Priscilla Owen the other day. The other was Senator Lott \nwho voted against Mr. Gregory on the Fourth Circuit a few years ago. \nOtherwise, none.\n  Senator Frist has spoken in the last few weeks about leader-led \nfilibusters of judges--whatever that means. What I am concerned about \nis a leader-led rubberstamping of nominees, nominees who have not even \nconvinced noted conservatives they belong on the bench. I continue to \nbelieve Judge Brown was one of the worst picks this President has made \nto our appellate courts. That is based on her record, not on her race \nor her gender or her background.\n  I wish my friends across the aisle would look at that record. If my \ncolleagues on the other side ask themselves three simple questions--is \nthe nominee a strict constructionist? Is the nominee a judicial \nactivist? Is the nominee a mainstream conservative?--they would be \nforced to vote against her.\n  I could not support Judge Brown's nomination the first time; I cannot \nsupport the nomination now. I urge my colleagues, especially my \nmoderate colleagues from the other side of the aisle, to vote against \nher also.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Parliamentary inquiry: It is my understanding the senior \nSenator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, is to be recognized at the hour of 2 \no'clock; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no such order.\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, then, I just simply, in my own right, seek the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination \nof Justice Janice Rogers Brown to serve as a judge on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n  The court to which Justice Brown has been nominated is one with which \nI am, I say in a humble way, most familiar. I practiced law there. When \nI was an assistant U.S. attorney I appeared before the Circuit Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia on many occasions. But most \nsignificantly, upon my graduation from the University of Virginia Law \nSchool in 1953, I was privileged to serve as a law clerk to Judge E. \nBarrett Prettyman of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia Circuit. Judge Prettyman later became chief judge of this very \nimportant circuit court.\n  As a result of the profound respect so many people had, including \nmyself, for Judge Prettyman, I had the honor several years ago of \nsponsoring, and with the help of others, passing, legislation to name \nthe Federal courthouse in D.C. after Judge Prettyman.\n  Now, a half century later, after I had the honor of serving as a law \nclerk on this court, I am pleased, today, to strongly support the \nnomination of Justice Janice Rogers Brown to this very same court.\n  When I started to evaluate Justice Brown's qualifications for this \nprestigious judgeship, I turned first, as I do with every nomination, \nto the U.S. Constitution. Article II, section 2 of the Constitution \ngives the President the responsibility to nominate, with the ``Advice \nand Consent of the Senate,'' individuals to serve as judges on the \nFederal courts. Thus, the Constitution provides a role for both the \nPresident and the Senate in this process. The President has the \nresponsibility of nominating, and the Senate has the responsibility to \nrender advice and consent on the nomination.\n  I am very pleased to have been a part of the group of 14 who brought \nbefore this body a concept by which we could proceed on these Federal \njudges. Justice Brown is the second in that series. I speak with pride \nabout our accomplishment. In no way do we intend to usurp the roles of \nour distinguished majority leader and the Democratic leader. But, \nnevertheless, after consulting with them, we went forward with our \nframework agreement. And this agreement now seems to be working for the \ngreater benefit of the Senate and for the important role the Senate has \nwith respect to its constitutional responsibilities of advice and \nconsent to help establish the third\n\n[[Page S6193]]\n\nbranch of our Government--our Federal judiciary. It is essential the \nvacancies be filled in a timely manner to enable that court to serve \nthe people all across our Nation.\n  With respect to judicial nominees, I have always considered a number \nof factors before casting my vote to confirm or give advice and \nconsent, as the case may be. The nominee's character, professional \ncareer, experience, integrity and temperament are all important. In \naddition, I consider whether the nominee is likely to interpret law \naccording to precedent or impose his or her own views. The opinions of \nthe officials from the State in which the nominee would serve, or \nStates in the case of the circuit court of appeals, the views of the \npersons who have known and have observed the nominee through the years, \nand the writings and the record of the nominee, all are taken into \nconsideration. That is because I believe our judiciary should reflect a \nbroad diversity of the citizens it serves all across the Nation.\n  In this instance, I was privileged to invite Justice Brown to my \noffice. We sat down, and I found her to be an extraordinarily \naccomplished individual. We had a very extensive exchange of views \nregarding the important post to which she has been nominated and the \nqualifications which she possesses. And she does possess outstanding \nqualifications; first, to have earned the nomination from our \ndistinguished President and, secondly, to earn the support of this body \nin the advice and consent role.\n  I believe she will make an excellent jurist on this most respected \ncourt.\n  Her legal career spans more than a quarter of a century. After \ngraduating with her bachelor's degree from California State University, \nJustice Brown went on to earn her law degree in 1977 from the \nUniversity of California School of Law.\n  After passing the California bar exam, which I believe is considered \nnationwide to be one of the most difficult of the bar exams, she began \na career in public service, mostly in positions with the State of \nCalifornia. She worked in the deputy attorney general's office for the \nState of California, and later worked in the deputy secretary and \ngeneral counsel's office in the Business, Transportation and Housing \nAgency of California--again, giving her a breadth and depth of \nexperience regarding the problems and challenges that face our citizens \nall over this country.\n  After practicing law in the private sector for about a year, Janice \nBrown returned to public service by working in Gov. Pete Wilson's legal \naffairs office from 1991 to 1994. How privileged I am to have served \nwith Senator Pete Wilson, later Governor, in this body for a number of \nyears. We became close friends. We worked together, particularly on \nmatters regarding national security and the military. He was a former \nmarine in his lifetime, as was I, and I have a great mutual respect for \nhim.\n\n  In 1994, Janice Brown left the Governor's office to serve as a \njustice on the intermediate California Appellate Court. Subsequently, \nin 1996, my good friend, then-Gov. Pete Wilson of California, had the \nhonor of promoting Justice Brown to the California Supreme Court. With \nher appointment, Justice Brown became the first African-American woman \nto sit on the California high court.\n  Mr. President, I take humble pride in having, during my career in the \nSenate, recommended to a President the first African American in our \nState's history to serve on the United States District Court for the \nEastern District of Virginia. His name came before the Senate. \nSubsequent to confirmation, and years of experience on the court, he \nrose to become the chief judge of the district in which his court \nresides in my State. This very fine man, with his customary quiet and \ndignified pride, his superb knowledge of the law, and understanding, \nserves Virginia with great distinction today.\n  And such will be the case with Justice Janice Rogers Brown in her \nservice to the Nation on this prestigious court.\n  Indeed, since 1996 she has served the citizens of the State of \nCalifornia on the California high court, and she has earned their \nconfidence as a jurist.\n  In the California system, once a judge is appointed, he or she comes \nbefore the voting public for confirmation or rejection in the next \ngeneral election. That moment came in 1998 for Justice Brown when she \nand four other justices on the California Supreme Court came before the \npublic in that election. While all were confirmed by the California \nvoters, it is notable that Justice Brown was confirmed with the highest \npercent of the vote, nearly 76 percent--an astounding vote of \nconfidence.\n  But Justice Brown's accolades don't just come from the voting public \nin California, they also come from a wide range of other people who \nknow her well. Judges who served with her on the California Court of \nAppeals, a bipartisan group of law school professors in California, \ncolleagues on other courts across the Nation, and others--they all \nagree: Justice Janice Rogers Brown is a brilliant legal scholar who \nrespects the doctrine of stare decisis and who would make an \noutstanding Federal appeals court judge.\n  All of this is reason enough to confirm this highly qualified \nindividual. But, when you put all that Justice Brown has achieved in \ncontext, it becomes even more apparent what an amazing individual we \nhave before us in the Senate today.\n  You see, Janice Rogers Brown was born to sharecroppers in Greenville, \nAL. She attended segregated schools in the South and came of age in the \nmidst of Jim Crow laws. Through hard work, she has earned her education \nand her legal credentials, and today she comes before us as one of the \nmost brilliant legal minds this country has to offer.\n  I am proud to speak on behalf of this outstanding nominee, and it is \nmy hope that the Senate will soon confirm Justice Janice Rogers Brown \nto the Federal bench.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, a few weeks ago, the debate in this Chamber \ncaptured the attention of the Nation. At stake was the maintenance of \ncore constitutional principles of separation of powers and a limited \njudiciary against an unprecedented strategy of filibustering judicial \nnominees. Prior to 2003, Senators exercised self-restraint. In theory, \nthe opportunity was always there for us to filibuster the President's \njudicial nominees, but out of proper respect for the President, whoever \nthe President was, his power of appointment, and with an appropriate \nmodesty about our own constitutional role, we refrained from exercising \nthis power to filibuster judges.\n  We kept ourselves in check. In spite of real philosophical \ndifferences about the nature of judging and the meaning of the \nConstitution's fundamental guarantees, we all agreed on one thing: The \nConstitution's separation of powers prevented us from adopting a \nstrategy of permanent minority-led filibusters of judicial nominees.\n  That self-restraint was tossed aside, however, in 2003. Led in large \npart by my friend and colleague, the senior Senator from New York, the \nDemocratic leadership determined to engage in a full-blown inquiry of \nwhat they called the ideology of judicial nominees. Never before have \nopponents of a limited judiciary been so brazen with their litmus \ntests. They would now openly reject qualified nominees because of their \nstrongly held personal beliefs, not for their judicial temperament, \nnot for their experience, not for their character. Rather, nominees \nwould be rejected because of their personal beliefs.\n\n  For some reason, what they termed ``strongly held personal beliefs'' \nwere particularly suspect. California Supreme Court Justice Janice \nRogers Brown, an eminently qualified jurist, was one of the primary \ntargets of this radical strategy. For a few thought-provoking speeches \nshe had given, some have tried to label her too extreme for the bench.\n  There is no doubt Janice Rogers Brown is conservative, but her views \nare hardly out of the ordinary. They are views shared by many millions \nof regular citizens, citizens of different economic, geographic, \nfinancial, ethnic, and religious backgrounds. Most importantly, \nhowever, it is clear that\n\n[[Page S6194]]\n\nher personal views, whatever they are, do not cloud her judgment on the \nbench. Justice Brown's opinions are fully within the mainstream of \nAmerican jurisprudence. It is the liberal activist groups that are \npurposefully misrepresenting Justice Brown's opinions, and what they \nthink are her views, that are stranded out on the far left bank of \nAmerican politics. Those groups belong on the far left bank of American \npolitics, and that bank is way out of the mainstream.\n  The President takes his constitutional responsibilities seriously \nwhen he nominates individuals to the Federal bench. I have worked \nclosely with the White House for the last 4\\1/2\\ years on these judges, \nso I know that to be true. I know that as Senators, we take our \nresponsibilities seriously when we review and confirm these \nindividuals. When determining a person's fitness for the Federal bench, \nwe evaluate their character and we inspect their records. We consider \njudicial experience, public service, legal work, academic achievement, \npersonal character, and the ability for objectivity.\n  With these qualities in mind, it is worth considering the view of \nJustice Brown held by a number of prominent California law professors.\n  In a letter sent to me in my former capacity as chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, a group of 15 distinguished California law \nprofessors had the following to say about Justice Brown:\n\n       We know Justice Brown to be a person of high intelligence, \n     unquestioned integrity, and evenhandedness. Since we are of \n     differing political beliefs and perspectives, Democratic, \n     Republican and Independent, we wish especially to emphasize \n     what we believe is Justice Brown's strongest credential for \n     appointment to this important seat on the D.C. Circuit: her \n     open-minded and thorough appraisal of legal argumentation--\n     even when her personal views may conflict with those \n     arguments.\n\n  Having gotten to know Justice Brown during this unnecessarily \nprotracted confirmation process, I fully concur in this bipartisan \nconsensus. And I can tell you she has cultivated these virtues against \nmany odds.\n  Janice Rogers Brown was born in Greenville, AL, in 1949. She attended \nsegregated schools. She was a firsthand witness to the injustice of Jim \nCrow and its failure to extend the promise of the 14th amendment to the \ndescendants of freed slaves. Equal protection under the law was only a \ndream in the Deep South at that time when young Janice Rogers Brown \nleft her African-American family for California.\n  Yet this girl who grew up listening to her grandmother's stories \nabout NAACP Fred Gray, the man who courageously defended Martin Luther \nKing, Jr., and Rosa Parks, brought to the golden State of California a \npassion for civil rights and a need for impartial justice.\n  Janice Rogers Brown cultivated this passion for justice through a \ncareer of almost uninterrupted public service as an attorney. After \ngraduating from law school at UCLA, she served 2 years as deputy \nlegislative counsel in the California Legislative Counsel Bureau. Then \nfrom 1979 to 1987, she was deputy attorney general in the office of the \nCalifornia Attorney General. Her work there was of such high quality \nthat it led to her appointment as the deputy secretary and general \ncounsel for the California Business, Transportation, and Housing Agency \nin 1987 where she supervised the State's banking, real estate, \ncorporations, thrift, and insurance departments. No dunce could have \ndone that. No person as described by some of my colleagues on the other \nside would have been chosen in that great State of California to do \nthat. She has been very badly derided by picking and choosing little \nsnippets here and there and taking them out of context.\n  From 1991 until 1994, she served as the legal affairs secretary to \nCalifornia Gov. Pete Wilson. I personally chatted with Pete Wilson, who \nis an old friend. He said she was terrific. He relied on her legal \nabilities.\n  Then in 1994, she embarked on the professional journey that \nculminated in her nomination to the Circuit Court of Appeals of the \nDistrict of Columbia. First, she was nominated and confirmed as an \nassociate justice on the California Third District Court of Appeals. \nThen in 1996, Gov. Pete Wilson elevated her to the position of \nassociate justice on the California Supreme Court.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record her funeral eulogy for \none of the great judges on that first appellate court.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   California Supreme Court Justice Janice Rogers Brown's Eulogy of \n   Retired Justice Robert K. Puglia, Former Presiding Justice of the \n      California Court of Appeal for the Third Appellate District\n\n       Justice Robert K. Puglia was described--not too long ago--\n     as ``a treasure'' to Sacramento's legal community. It is no \n     exaggeration to say that his wit and wisdom will be \n     irreplaceable. Justice Puglia once referred to himself--with \n     the self-deprecating humor that was so characteristic--as ``a \n     dinosaur.'' At his retirement dinner, I ventured to say that \n     he was ``not so much a dinosaur as an ancient artifact. Like \n     the Rosetta Stone. A text from which we could decipher the \n     best of our past and--if we are lucky--find our way back to \n     the future.''\n       We are here today, much too soon, to celebrate his life, \n     his legacy to us. The Library and Courts Building was his \n     home for nearly 30 years. He worked there as a newly minted \n     lawyer during a brief stint as a deputy attorney general in \n     1958 and 1959, and returned in 1974 when he became a member \n     of the Third District Court of Appeal, a court where he \n     served as the presiding justice from 1974 until November \n     1998. In 1994, after a reception welcoming me to the court, \n     we stood on the steps of the court building and looked across \n     the circle toward Office Building 1 at the words carved on \n     the pediment: ``Men to Match My Mountains,'' a fragment from \n     a poem by Samuel Walter Foss called ``The Coming American.'' \n     Justice Puglia gave me the sidelong, sardonic glance, which I \n     already recognized as a sure prelude to some outrageous \n     comment. Giving an exaggerated sigh, he said: ``I suppose we \n     will have to sandblast those words and come up with something \n     more politically correct. Perhaps--``People to Parallel my \n     Promontories.'' We both laughed. In its fuller exposition, \n     the poem is a paean to the westward expansion of the country:\n\n     Bring me men to match my mountains,\n     Bring me men to match my plains;\n     Men to chart a starry empire,\n     Men to make celestial claims.\n     Men to sail beyond my oceans,\n     Reaching for the galaxies.\n     These are men to build a nation,\n     Join the mountains to the sky;\n     Men of faith and inspiration . . .\n\n       In retrospect, it occurs to me that although Justice Puglia \n     was inordinately proud of his Buckeye roots, like Norton \n     Parker Chipman, the first Chief Justice of the Third \n     Appellate District, he was also a citizen of California who \n     filled a larger-than-life role. He was one of those men who \n     matched her mountains.\n       As a young lawyer who did appellate work, I quickly came to \n     admire Justice Puglia's jurisprudence. His opinions were \n     intelligent, wise, witty, clear and completely accessible. He \n     did not write in the dry, dull, bureaucratic style of most \n     modern judges. His thoughts, clearly and eloquently \n     expressed, were sometimes impassioned. Indeed, he made \n     passion respectable. His opinions exude the rare sense of \n     style and unique voice that Posner tells us is ``inseparable \n     from the idea of a great judge in [the common law] \n     tradition.''\n       Justice Puglia deserves a place in the pantheon of great \n     American judges. He completely understood the role and \n     relished it. He exhibited the classical judicial virtues: \n     impartiality, prudence, practical wisdom, persuasiveness, and \n     candor. He demonstrated complete mastery of his craft. He had \n     a keen awareness of the ebb and flow of history, and of the \n     need for consistent jurisprudence, and, above all, self-\n     restraint. It may sound odd to describe a judge as both \n     passionate and restrained, but it is precisely this apparent \n     paradox--passionate devotion to the rule of law and humility \n     in the judicial role--that allows freedom to prevail in a \n     democratic republic.\n       The generation that fought in World War II has been labeled \n     ``The Greatest Generation'' for their courage and \n     selflessness, but that sobriquet belongs as well to their \n     younger brothers who fought in Korea. Their attitudes were \n     shaped by many of the same pivotal moments in American \n     history, and Bob Puglia exemplified the best of his \n     generation. He was born on the cusp of the Great Depression \n     and came of age during Word War II. He became a devoted \n     student of history, and perhaps that is why he seems to have \n     had an instinctive appreciation of valor, duty, and \n     sacrifice.\n       He scorned political correctness, but he treated every \n     human being with dignity and respect. Whether he was dealing \n     with the janitor or the governor, he never saw people as \n     abstractions, proxies, or means to an end. He saw them as \n     individuals and took them as he found them; expected the best \n     of them; and never demanded more of anyone than he demanded \n     of himself. His sense of fairness and justice applied to \n     everyone, but his sense of humor was irrepressible. In one \n     memorable case where a defendant filed an appeal quibbling \n     over the deprivation of a single day of credit, Justice \n     Puglia agreed with the inmate in a brief unpublished opinion. \n     He found the court had miscalculated, and ended the opinion \n     with the cheery admonition to ``have a nice day!''\n\n[[Page S6195]]\n\n       In my youth, I admired and respected him and wanted to \n     emulate him. As I grew older and had more opportunities to \n     get to know him, to become first an acquaintance, then a \n     colleague, and a friend, I came to love him. I do not think \n     there is one person within his orbit who was not the \n     beneficiary of his wisdom, encouragement, and generosity. He \n     gave us his ``Rules to Live By'' to amuse us. But, the way he \n     lived his life inspired us. He was devoted to his wife Ingrid \n     and endearingly proud of his children. Indeed, he had a \n     disconcerting tendency to adopt any of us when he felt we \n     needed guidance.\n       He taught us that character counts and integrity is \n     personal. He never allowed cruelty or deception or hypocrisy \n     to go unchallenged. He did the right thing even when he would \n     have benefited from doing the expedient thing. Freedom is not \n     free he would often remind us, but, in Justice Puglia's view, \n     it was worth the price--however dear.\n       His life experience and his understanding of history \n     produced in him a certain toughness--the power of facing the \n     difficult and unpleasant without flinching; discipline and \n     intellectual rigor; physical courage; and, even more \n     importantly, the courage to be different. Never one to follow \n     the herd of independent minds, his was a unique voice. As \n     California's Chief Justice has ruefully acknowledged, Justice \n     Puglia was ``a strong personality . . . not shy of stating \n     his beliefs, nor about challenging others to justify theirs'' \n     but surprisingly willing to listen and modify his views. He \n     was, as his long-time colleague Justice Blease noted: \n     ``formidable'' and ``intimidating,'' but he had a ``heart of \n     gold.''\n       There are so many themes and threads that run through \n     Justice Puglia's life and the history of the Third District \n     Court of Appeal that I do not think it can be mere \n     coincidence. Norton Parker Chipman had stood on the \n     battlefield at Gettysburg when Lincoln gave that memorable \n     speech. Justice Puglia was a student of history--especially \n     the Civil War era. He could speak of Andersonville and Robert \n     E. Lee and the battles of that terrible war as easily as \n     other people recite the latest baseball scores. There are \n     similarities in the descriptions of Justice Puglia and \n     President Lincoln that are striking.\n       In a speech in 1906, Norton Parker Chipman recalled that \n     his friend Abraham Lincoln was ``firm as the granite hills,'' \n     yet capable of great patience and forbearance. Carl Sandburg \n     described Lincoln as ``both steel and velvet . . . hard as \n     rock and soft as the drifting fog.'' Reading these words \n     caused a shock of recognition, for I had been seeing exactly \n     this sort of paradox and contradiction in the life of Justice \n     Puglia.\n       Seeing these parallels, I have come to understand that this \n     flexibility is neither paradox nor accommodation. It is just \n     the opposite--a sense of sure-footedness and balance that is \n     often the defining trait of people of great character and \n     impeccable integrity. It is precisely this quality which \n     makes the honest public intellectual, a man like Bob Puglia, \n     so extraordinary.\n       In his first message to Congress in 1862, Lincoln warned \n     that we might ``nobly save, or meanly lose, the last best \n     hope of earth.'' Lincoln, of course, was referring to the \n     Union. Justice Puglia felt that same sense of fierce \n     commitment to the rule of law. The preservation of the rule \n     of law and of the equality of all people under that rule was, \n     in his view, the core principle of liberty and the only \n     reason America might qualify for such a grand epithet.\n       My favorite movie scene is in To Kill a Mockingbird. It is \n     the scene where Atticus Finch has argued brilliantly and \n     raised much more than a reasonable doubt, virtually proving \n     the innocence of the accused, but the jury still returns a \n     guilty verdict. Most of the spectators file noisily into the \n     street, gossiping and celebrating. Upstairs, relegated to the \n     balcony, another audience has watched the proceedings and \n     remains seated. As Atticus Finch gathers his papers and walks \n     slowly from the courtroom, they rise silently in unison. The \n     Black minister, Reverend Sykes, taps Scout on the shoulder \n     and says: ``Miss Jean Louise, stand up. Your father's \n     passin'.'' To me, this silent homage to a good and courageous \n     man, who respects and believes in the rule of law--and is \n     willing to defend it even at great personal cost--is the most \n     moving moment in the whole film.\n       Justice Puglia was just such a man. And he was not a \n     fictional character. Most of us have risen to our feet many \n     times to mark his passage because he was a judge. Court \n     protocol required us to show respect for the robe and what it \n     represented. But Justice Puglia was the kind of man who \n     earned and could command our respect by virtue of his life \n     and character. In a way, the robe was superfluous.\n       We have had the great good fortune to know this \n     extraordinary man. We can remember what he taught us. We need \n     not be fearless to have courage. We can be tough and tender. \n     We can do the right thing--and face the bad that cannot be \n     avoided unflinchingly. We can laugh. And we must sing--even \n     when people frown at us and advise us to keep our day jobs. \n     We can care for the people around us. We can be generous. We \n     can make our way, against the tide, without rancor or \n     bitterness. And when we are tired and overburdened and feel \n     we are not brave enough to go on, we will hear his voice in \n     our ear. Hear him say in that quiet and steely tone: ``Yes, \n     you can. You can.'' And we will know that we are being true \n     to his legacy. The legacy of one who loved liberty. We will \n     know that we are standing up . . . because Justice Puglia is \n     passin'.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, Janice Rogers Brown's deep and \nuncompromising desire to secure equal justice for everyone who appears \nbefore her is evident off the bench as well. She has served as a member \nof the California Commission on the Status of African-American Males. \nThis bipartisan commission made recommendations for addressing \ninequities in the treatment of African-American males in employment, \nbusiness development, and the criminal justice and health care systems. \nThis was noble work.\n  In addition, as a member of the Governor's child support task force, \nshe made recommendations on how to improve California's child support \nenforcement system. No small matter. She would not have been trusted \nwith that had she been as described by some of my eminent colleagues \nand friends on the other side.\n  Justice Brown's critics cannot escape this story, so they turn to her \nstatements off the bench and to her decisions on the bench in \nCalifornia to assert misleadingly that she is extreme. The instances \nthey cite do not support these hysterical charges, and I want to \nconsider them at some length.\n  One of Justice Brown's speeches received quite a bit of attention. In \nApril 2000, she was invited to speak at the University of Chicago Law \nSchool. I have had the same privilege, by the way. Evidently, her \ncritics say what she said there was so radical that we should keep her \noff the Federal bench.\n  Never mind that a public speech is an opportunity to be provocative, \nespecially at a law school. Never mind that judges, like most folks, \nare able to separate out their personal and political beliefs from \ntheir professional duties. And never mind that Justice Brown was doing \na service to these students by coming to speak before them, jar their \nimaginations, and give them something more to think about.\n  The fact is, what she said was not that radical. Groups have keyed in \non her colorful critique of the New Deal. Give me a break. The same \npeople who come down here decrying Justice Brown's description of the \nNew Deal as revolutionary turn around 5 minutes later and claim that \nour current Social Security system cannot be adjusted one iota to \naddress contemporary concerns because it was central to the New Deal's \npolitical revolution. Can you imagine, these very same people who find \nso much fault with her? You cannot have it both ways.\n  Their real problem is that Justice Brown then went on to criticize \nsome of the unintended social and political consequences of big \nGovernment. When she claimed that an increasing public sphere tended to \nundermine the individualist spirit present at America's founding, she \nwas saying nothing other than what de Tocqueville, Ronald Reagan, \nBooker T. Washington, Robert F. Kennedy, and countless political \nphilosophers and economists have noted over the years.\n  Everyone knows that it takes a village--families and communities--not \na sterile Government-mandated bureaucracy to raise a child or, rather, \nthat it takes a family, not the Government, to raise young citizens.\n  Yet her critics treat Justice Brown's claims as trying to prove that \nthe world is flat. The senior Senator from Massachusetts was on the \nfloor yesterday afternoon and today arguing that Justice Brown's claim \nthat an increasing public sphere is detrimental to civil society is \noutside the legal mainstream. Again, give me a break.\n  I cannot help but think that for Janice Rogers Brown, this criticism \nof big Government is related to her experience growing up in the Deep \nSouth and her adulthood working for the State of California. She did \nnot have to read about Jim Crow in books. She lived it. My sense is \nthat part of Justice Brown's commitment to rugged individualism is \nrelated to this hard-learned lesson: There are limits to what \nGovernment can accomplish.\n  That is precisely what President Reagan stated in his first inaugural \naddress. When he said this in 1981, some of the very same people who \nattack Janice Rogers Brown today said President Reagan was out of the \nmainstream. That was the argument by the very same people back then.\n  Nowhere was this well-intentioned governmental overreach more \napparent\n\n[[Page S6196]]\n\nthan in our failed experiment with welfare. Republicans and Democrats \nalike, originally led by the insights of our former colleague, the late \nDemocratic Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, understood the detrimental \nimpact of welfare on the urban poor in particular. I think Janice \nRogers Brown understood that lesson as well.\n  But for articulating a similar skepticism about Government, Janice \nRogers Brown has been branded a radical revolutionary. Quite the \ncontrary. Her arguments have been based on reasonable concerns. And \nhers was a conclusion reached over the years by millions of Americans.\n  A few of Justice Brown's many decisions while a judge have also \nserved as a source of the criticism that has been unfairly leveled at \nher. Of all the criticisms of Justice Brown, none more rankles than the \nclaim she opposes civil rights. That is laughable. This is par for the \ncourse for some of these leftwing, fringe groups that have been \nsmearing and attacking Republican nominees ever since I can remember, \nbut certainly ever since Justice Rehnquist had his hearings and was \nconfirmed to the Supreme Court as Chief Justice.\n  Just this week, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee was \nquoted as telling a group in San Francisco that Republicans are ``not \nvery friendly to different kinds of people.'' He called the GOP \n``pretty much a monolithic party. They all behave the same. They all \nlook the same. It's pretty much a white Christian party.'' This is \nracial demagoguery, pure and simple, done by the chairman of the \nDemocratic National Party. If I didn't know how bright he was, I would \ncall him a raving idiot. But maybe he is just that part of the time.\n  This desperate rhetoric has a purpose: to mask the increasing \nattraction of conservative ideas to African Americans, Hispanic \nAmericans, Jewish Americans, and other minorities the Democrats have \nfelt they have an absolute claim to, no matter how outrageous some of \ntheir programs and ideas are.\n  So it is not surprising that when the organized critics of Janice \nRogers Brown send their faxes to the press, her argument in the \ndecision People v. McKay is notably absent. This is what she had to say \nthere:\n\n       In the Spring of 1963, civil rights protests in Birmingham \n     united this country in a new way. Seeing peaceful protesters \n     jabbed with cattle prods, held at bay by snarling police \n     dogs, and flattened by powerful streams of water from water \n     hoses galvanized the nation.\n       Without being constitutional scholars, we understood \n     violence, coercion and oppression. We understood what \n     constitutional limits are designed to restrain. We reclaimed \n     our constitutional aspirations. What is happening now is more \n     subtle, more diffuse, and less visible, but it is only a \n     difference in degree. If harm is still being done to people \n     because they are black, or brown, or poor, the oppression is \n     not lessened by the absence of television cameras.\n\n  She wrote those words while arguing for the exclusion of evidence of \ndrug possession discovered after an African-American defendant was \narrested for riding his bicycle the wrong way on a residential street. \nShe believed that the only reason this person was stopped was because \nof his race, and she was the only one of her colleagues on the supreme \ncourt to argue for the exclusion of this evidence on the grounds that \nit was the product of improper racial profiling. Yet our colleagues \nover here say she is an opponent of civil rights. Give me a break.\n  I have seen and heard just about everything in my years in the \nSenate, but the highly partisan campaign of the NAACP against Janice \nRogers Brown is particularly shameful. It is sad to see the NAACP, the \nNation's foremost civil rights institution, become little more than a \npartisan special interest group.\n  The other day I received a fax from their office urging me to vote \nagainst Justice Brown's confirmation because she was, ``hostile towards \ncivil rights and the civil liberties of African Americans and other \nracial and ethnic minorities.''\n  My stomach turned when I read this. Not only is this irresponsible \nrhetoric, not only is it unfair and uncharitable, it is without any \nreal foundation. In other words, it is total bullcorn, and it is wrong.\n  The NAACP, along with a number of other groups, has turned to Justice \nBrown's opinion in Hi-Voltage Wire Works, Inc., v. City of San Jose to \nshow that she is inhospitable to minorities because of her supposed \nstance on affirmative action. These arguments, again, are way off the \nmark and an analysis of them demonstrates not only that Justice Brown \nis a mainstream conservative judge but also that these interest groups \nare extremely liberal outfits attempting to gain through judicial fiat \nwhat they cannot fairly win through the legislative process through the \nelected representatives of the people.\n  The Hi-Voltage case involved California's proposition 209. In a \npopular referendum, the people of California were clear: Discrimination \nor preferential treatment on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, \nor national origin violates core constitutional principles of equal \ntreatment under the law. Therefore, proposition 209 prevented \ndiscrimination in any public employment, public education, or public \ncontracting.\n  Now, at issue in this case was a San Jose minority contracting \nprogram that required contractors bidding on city projects to employ a \nspecified percentage of minority and women contractors. In her opinion, \nJustice Brown merely did what every judge who ever reviewed this case \ndid. Through the trial court, through the appellate court, to the \nSupreme Court, all concurred with Justice Brown that this program was \nexactly the type of noxious racial quota program that proposition 209 \nwas designed to prevent.\n  Her critics charge this demonstrates her blanket opposition to \naffirmative action. Such a conclusion depends on a deliberate \nmisreading of Justice Brown's opinion in this case. She could not have \nbeen any more clear. She did not oppose affirmative action in all \ncircumstances. These are her words:\n\n       Equal protection does not preclude race-conscious programs.\n\n  Contrary to the propaganda being issued by liberal interest groups, \nJustice Brown's opinion explicitly authorizes affirmative action \nprograms.\n  I do not blame my colleagues on the other side completely because \nmost of the time they just take what these outside leftwing radical \ngroups give them and read it like it is true. So I say I do not blame \nthem completely. But unlike the Supreme Court of the United States, the \npeople of California have rejected quotas and race-based head counting.\n  Those are not affirmative action programs that merely take race into \naccount. Programs such as the one under review in the Hi-Voltage case \nare improper quota programs. For following the mandate of California \ncitizens on this subject, she has been called radical.\n  The NAACP's criticism is, as usual, overblown. They claim that \nJustice Brown's decision ``makes it extremely difficult to conduct any \nsort of meaningful affirmative action program in California.''\n  But what is a meaningful affirmative action program? I fear that \nthese leftwing liberal interest groups are suggesting that the only \nmeaningful type of affirmative action program is the type of quota \nprogram specifically banned by proposition 209. As it turns out then, \nJustice Brown's real failure in this case is that she did not tailor \nthe law to suit her own moral and political preferences. For this, she \nis demonized as a radical. It is her failure to embrace full-blown \njudicial activism that is her principal failing in the minds of her \ndetractors.\n\n  Consider her opinion in American Academy of Pediatrics v. Lundgren. \nThis case involved California's parental consent law. Parental consent \nlaws are not rightwing policies. They are moderate restrictions on \nabortion rights supported by substantial majorities of the American \npeople.\n  I find it interesting that the same groups that champion the right of \na woman to make an informed choice about obtaining an abortion also \nreject moderate restrictions on the accessibility of abortion to minors \nwho routinely do not possess the judgment necessary for the profound \nmoral and philosophical decision to obtain an abortion.\n  We should not forget the U.S. Supreme Court, while acknowledging the \nright to an abortion, also has held that it is permissible under the \nConstitution to establish parental consent laws such as California's. \nCalifornia courts have long relied on Supreme Court precedents when \ndefining the boundaries of\n\n[[Page S6197]]\n\ntheir State's own constitutional right to privacy. That is the context \nof this decision, and in it Justice Brown dissented from the \ndetermination of an activist court to overturn California's moderate \nrestriction on abortion rights. She wrote:\n\n       When the claim at issue involves fundamentally moral and \n     philosophic questions as to which there is no clear answer, \n     courts must remain tentative, recognizing the primacy of \n     legislative prerogatives.\n\n  She continued, adding that:\n\n       The fundamental flaw running through its analysis is the \n     utter lack of deference to the ordinary constraints of \n     judicial decision-making--deference to state precedent, to \n     federal precedent, to the collective judgment of our \n     Legislature, and, ultimately to the people we serve.\n\n  This is not some debate over a speech that Justice Brown gave at a \nlaw school forum. We know that is not the real threat to these interest \ngroups. They can see that judges such as Janice Rogers Brown take their \noaths seriously. They will interpret the law rather than act as super \nlegislators and make the law.\n  By showing deference to the people's representatives and the \nlegislative and executive branches, these groups which too often today \ntry to take the easy way out will now have to engage in the political \nprocess to win their points of view. Personally, I believe this would \nbe a healthy development, but to those uncompromising special interest \ngroups the democratic process is a threat, not a gift.\n  Soon we are going to have to vote on Justice Brown's nomination. I am \nglad and thankful that we are finally reaching this point after the \nnumber of years we have been at it. I know many people wanted to move \nbeyond these divisive debates over judges. I appreciate their desire to \nmove beyond this messy business of judicial nominations and I \nunderstand the desire to applaud the deal that has allowed last week's \nvote on Priscilla Owen and our vote later today on Janice Rogers Brown. \nThe ultimate meaning of this compromise is yet unknown, but one thing \nwe do know, these qualified women will have long careers on the bench \nin large part because the majority leader had the guts and decided to \npress this issue, reestablish longstanding Senate precedents, and tried \nto support the constitutional separation of powers.\n  Our senatorial power of advice and consent does not include the right \nto permanently filibuster judicial nominees. We have gone a long way to \nreaffirming what used to be an obvious truth, and we owe a debt of \ngratitude to the leader for helping to make this happen. We should also \nacknowledge the well-intentioned efforts of the 14 Senators involved in \nfacilitating these votes. I know many conservatives are upset with this \narrangement. I am myself. I am certainly not entirely comfortable with \nall the aspects of it myself, and I have said that it may prove to be a \ntruce, not a treaty. We will have to wait and see what the full \nimplications of this deal really are.\n  It does seem, however, that the cloture votes on nominees such as \nPriscilla Owen, Janice Rogers Brown, and William Pryor demonstrate the \nemergence of a filibuster-proof majority that believes even judges with \nconservative judicial philosophies are not the extraordinary cases that \nwould trigger a filibuster and that even a conservative African-\nAmerican woman has a chance to serve in this country. Unfortunately, \nsome have been against her primarily because she is a conservative \nAfrican-American woman.\n  We seem to be gaining ground in the fight against the erroneous \nbelief that nominees with whom one disagrees politically are \nundeserving of an up-or-down vote. Of course, the acid test of this \nagreement will come in the weeks ahead when the Senate addresses \nnominees not specifically granted a safe harbor by the compromise.\n  This debate over Janice Brown and others with her conservative \nphilosophy of judicial restraint is an important one. I will not \ncompromise on the principle that the American people and their elected \nrepresentatives, not judges, should make social policy. Our courthouses \nwere never intended to be mini-legislatures. Judges do not have the \nconstitutional responsibility, institutional capacity, the staff, or \nthe wisdom to be good policymakers, and judges are not and should not \nbe philosopher kings with some ability to divine the existence of \nrights not clearly expressed in statutory law created by the people's \nelected representatives or in constitutions established by the people \nthemselves.\n  We are told by some that Justice Brown is a radical. Shortly after \nthe President was elected in 2000, the Democratic Party held a retreat \nat which a number of liberal law professors urged them to ``change the \nground rules'' on judicial nominations. That was radical advice. It \nupset longstanding constitutional balances, and unfortunately it was \naccepted by the former minority leader.\n  We must reject this effort. I, for one, am not afraid to have this \ndebate. The American people know judicial activism when they see it. \nJust in the last few years we have been told by judges that the Pledge \nof Allegiance is unconstitutional, that our Bill of Rights should be \ninterpreted in light of decisions by the European Court of Human \nRights, and that well-considered bans on partial-birth abortion violate \ncore constitutional principles.\n  Only a few weeks ago, a Federal judge in Nebraska invalidated the \nduly passed State constitutional amendment that preserved traditional \nmarriage in that State. The definition of a judicial activist is \nsomeone who puts his or her own personal views ahead of what the law \nreally is.\n  Some of the leading groups opposed to Janice Brown oppose her \nprecisely because she will faithfully interpret the law rather than \nremaking it according to her own theory of justice. What they really \nobject to is Justice Brown's refusal to revise legal guarantees \naccording to some version of justice not present in a text.\n  I am proud of this body for allowing Justice Brown's nomination to \nfinally, at long last, come up for a vote. My guess is that she will \nsoon be sworn in as a Federal judge. That will be a great day not only \nfor Janice Rogers Brown, who has had to endure these coordinated, \ncalculated attacks on her character, but it will be a great day for \nthis Nation as well, and it will bring a lot of joy to me personally.\n  In all of the hundreds of judges who now sit on the bench, Janice \nRogers Brown is one of the finest people I have met and interviewed. So \nis Priscilla Owen. So is William Pryor, whom we will vote upon probably \ntomorrow. These are outstanding people, and so are the others who have \nbeen waiting for so long to just have the opportunity for a vote up or \ndown on this floor.\n  I am tired of seeing these good people maligned with false facts, to \nbegin with. I am tired of seeing them maligned with misinterpretations \nof the case law, primarily written by some of these outside groups that \nhave real axes to grind and that are on the far left bank outside of \nthe mainstream of the law itself.\n  I hope everybody will vote for Janice Rogers Brown. She will make a \nreal difference on the bench. She is a good person. I interviewed her \nfor more than 3 hours. I can say, I have seldom met a person of such \ncapacity, decency, dignity, and honor as she and Priscilla Owen. It \nwill be a great day to confirm her as a judge on the Circuit Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to speak to this nomination of this \nvery controversial nominee who is opposed by both Senators from \nCalifornia, which is fairly extraordinary. I remember well a time in \nthe not too distant past when even if one Senator from a State opposed \na nominee from his or her State, that sank the nomination. Then they \nsaid it had to be both.\n  We have a situation where both Senators from California oppose this \nnominee. I can assure the Senator from Utah, if he opposed a nominee \nwho came from his State, and his colleague did as well, I think I would \ngive it a little more, shall we say, attention than he is.\n  The fact is, if you have watched this debate, you know by now that \nthis nominee is way outside the mainstream. You can stand up here and \nsay all you want that she is in the mainstream and within the \nmainstream. You can even say that she won election in California. What \nyou are not saying is she came up for election about 11 months after \nshe had served a 12-year appointment, and she had no opposition. Nobody \nran against her. Most of\n\n[[Page S6198]]\n\nher controversial decisions occurred after that vote.\n  Anyone who knows anything about California politics knows that it is \nvery rare that judges are made into an election issue. We usually \napprove our judges. It is very different than what is being presented \nhere, that everyone went out and said: Oh, hurrah, Janice Rogers Brown \nis running. This is not the case at all. We have Senator Hatch coming \nup and saying this woman is well within the mainstream and all the rest \nof it, but the two Senators from California are saying: Watch out. \nBecause no statement could be further from the truth.\n  I have spoken on this nomination and on the broader issue several \ntimes. Sometimes you ask yourself, is it worth just one more time? I \nwould say, in answering my own question, to me it is worth it just one \nmore time because the issues surrounding these nominations we are \naddressing these next days will bring home to the American people why \nit was that we had all this fuss over 10 judges the Democrats blocked. \nThese are 10 judges put forward by President Bush who were all \nextraordinary cases, outside the mainstream, whether dealing with \nemployment rights or the environment or civil rights or human rights--\nany kind of rights you can think about: privacy rights, the right to \nmake sure our kids are protected and our criminals are punished.\n  In these 10 cases, we found many examples where our people were left \nin the lurch because of decisions made by these judges. In some cases, \nthese judges, fortunately, were in the minority. In the case of Janice \nRogers Brown, she was in the minority many times because she is so out \nof the mainstream that not even her five Republican colleagues could \njoin her in many of her dissents.\n  But this number, 208 to 10, reflects where we were when the \nRepublicans threw a fit and the White House threw a fit and said: We \nwant every one of our judges passed. We don't want to lose even 5 \npercent of our judges. They got 95 percent. They were not happy--208 to \n10, and they threatened to change a system that has been in place well \nbefore the movie ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' came out. For more \nthan 200 years, the Senate has had the right to unlimited debate that \ncan only be shut off by a supermajority. We have had that in place for \na very long time.\n  The Republicans did not like it. They only got 95 percent of their \njudges and, by God, they wanted 100 percent. It reminds me of my kids \nwhen they were little, and probably I was that way when I was little. \n``I want it all. I want everything. I don't want to give up a thing.'' \nThat is not the way the Senate works. It is not the way the country \nworks.\n  If you read what the Founders had in mind for our Nation, it was \nprotecting minority rights. So when an appointment such as this, which \nis a lifetime appointment--at very high pay, by the way, and very good \nretirement--that there would be a check and balance against this \nnominee, so only those who deserve to be on the bench, who show that \nthey had judicial temperament, who were qualified--underscore that, \nvery important--and who were in the mainstream, will take their seats. \nSo we had a crisis that, fortunately, I am very pleased to say, was \nresolved by some Republicans and Democrats who got together and stood \nup to the Republican leadership and said: Wrong. We are not going to do \nthis. We are not going to see a packing of the courts. We are going to \npreserve the filibuster.\n  But what happened was three very controversial judges got past that \nfilibuster. That was the deal that was cut, that Priscilla Owen, that \nPryor, and here Janice Rogers Brown would be guaranteed their cloture \nvote, and then we will now be voting on them. It will take 51 votes to \nstop Janice Rogers Brown. I hope we can get that.\n  Senator Hatch said he hopes every single person in the Senate will \nvote for Janice Rogers Brown. I predict, if she gets confirmed, it will \nbe by the fewest number of votes we have seen around here, probably, in \nmany years. I think so.\n\n  Let me talk about the issue of qualifications because this is \nsomething I did not discuss with my colleagues up until now. On April \n26, 1996, the Los Angeles Times wrote about an evaluation report that \nwas written about Judge Janice Rogers Brown. This is what the Times \nreported:\n\n       Bar evaluators received complaints that Brown was \n     insensitive to established legal precedent . . . lacked \n     compassion and intellectual tolerance for opposing views, \n     misunderstood legal standards and was slow to produce \n     opinions.\n\n  Can you imagine? This is the person who everyone who spoke on the \nother side today has said is so great, everyone who spoke on the other \nside said is so wonderful? This is the person they all said deserves to \nbe promoted? Let's read it again because it is important. This woman is \ngoing to the circuit court of appeals in Washington. ``Bar \nevaluators''--these are the people who are the experts--``received \ncomplaints that Brown was insensitive to established legal precedent . \n. . lacked compassion''--and we are going to show that--``and \nintellectual tolerance for opposing views. . . .'' In other words, \nintolerant to opposing views. Can you imagine a judge who is intolerant \nto opposing views? How can that judge be independent? How can that \njudge be fair if, going in, they are intolerant to certain views? And \nthey said she ``misunderstood legal standards.'' That is a condemnation \nfor someone who is going to be judging. ``And she was slow to produce \nopinions.'' We all know that we would like to have justice be swiftly \ndelivered. Justice delayed is justice denied. She was slow to produce \nopinions.\n  The LA Times goes on:\n\n       She does not possess the minimum qualifications necessary \n     for appointment to the highest court in the State,\n\n  That is my State, the California Supreme Court.\n\n     . . . the bar commission that reviews judicial nominees told \n     Governor Pete Wilson in a confidential report.\n\n  Janice Rogers Brown\n\n     . . . does not possess the minimum qualifications necessary \n     for appointment to the highest court in the State, the bar \n     commission that reviews judicial nominees told Governor Pete \n     Wilson in a confidential report.\n\n  This is the nominee Senator Hatch says he hopes everybody votes for. \nNow she is moving over to an area where she hasn't really practiced \nbefore, to the Federal bench.\n  Yesterday, I was at a press conference with some fantastic women \nlawyers, including Eleanor Holmes Norton, who you know, I think, is the \ndelegate to the House of Representatives from DC, and also Elaine \nJones. They went through, chapter and verse, her decisions, her \nwritings, her minority views. They agreed this is a terrible \nappointment. What is interesting is these are African-American women \nspeaking about an African-American woman. This is not easy to do. It is \nnot easy for a female Senator to say this is a terrible appointment.\n  This nominee's personal story is remarkable. There are a lot of \nremarkable stories in America. We are all so proud of our country, that \nit gives people opportunity. But what I am fearful about is what she is \ngoing to do to those who want to grab that dream. Her attitude toward \nwhat the government can and cannot do, her attitude about what is \npermissible in a workplace, is shocking. Her attitude toward senior \ncitizens, her attitude toward children, her attitude toward rape \nvictims, all of this is very frightening, to think this woman, with a \ngreat personal story, is going to bring those kinds of values and this \nkind of record to the court that many consider to be second in \nimportance to the Supreme Court of the United States of America.\n  There is no question that this nominee is way out of the mainstream. \nThis is one of her famous quotes. You listen to these words. These are \nnot the words of Senator Barbara Boxer or Senator Dianne Feinstein or \nSenator Patrick Leahy or Senator Harry Reid or any other Senator who is \nopposing this nominee; these are the words of the nominee:\n\n       Where government moves in, community retreats, civil \n     society disintegrates, and our ability to control our own \n     destiny atrophies. The result is: Families under siege; war \n     in the streets; unapologetic expropriation of property; the \n     precipitous decline of the rule of law; the rapid rise of \n     corruption; the loss of civility and the triumph of deceit. \n     The result is a debased, debauched culture which finds moral \n     depravity entertaining and virtue contemptible.\n\n  I don't know what country she grew up in. I really don't know how she \ngot her views of America because clearly she has been critical of the \ngovernment in her writings, going back to the 1930s. So, presumably, \nbecause she has been in the minority view on all the things\n\n[[Page S6199]]\n\nshe says and does, she has to be miserable about the state of America. \nShe thinks our families are under siege, that there is war in the \nstreets, that people are getting their property taken away from them, \nthat there is a decline in the rule of law. I guess she doesn't know we \nare doing much better controlling crime. Who does she think is going to \ncontrol crime if not government? Does she think we should have a \nprivate police force?\n  When government moves in, everything is terrible. Does that mean when \nwe build a highway things get worse, or do they get better? Does that \nmean if we fund a transit system things get worse, or they get better? \nDoes that mean when we fix a pothole or pass a law that you have to \nwear a seatbelt that things get worse, or things get better?\n  She is an idealogue because the answer is sometimes government does \ngood things, and sometimes we don't. Sometimes we do things we should \nnot do, and sometimes we don't do enough. But there is no way you can \nsay when government moves in, deceit triumphs and we have a debauched \nculture and virtue is contemptible. Is she that critical of this \ncountry? Is she that down on this country? Is she that negative about \nthe greatest country in the world? The answer is, she is.\n  Let's look at some of the other things she said. When we had the New \nDeal, this country was in the middle of a terrible depression, and the \nCongress and the President passed some overdue legislation such as the \nminimum wage because people were starving to death. They said it was \nimportant to have a 40-hour workweek because people were being worked \nto death. Social Security was instituted at that time. She calls this \n``the triumph of our own Socialist revolution.''\n\n  I am assuming, therefore, she thinks we should go back to the days \nwhen we did not have Social Security. That is interesting because there \nare other people who feel that way around here. So they happily vote \nfor Janice Rogers Brown. Does she think we should go back to the day \nwhen children worked in the workplace? Child labor laws were passed \naround that time. Does she think a boss can tell you, you have to work \n100 hours? I guess she does because it is socialism.\n  And then her famous quote about senior citizens. This is a woman who \nthis President wants to send to the second highest court in the land. \nHer view of senior citizens is extraordinary: She called senior \ncitizens ``cannibals.'' I want everyone to think of their grandma right \nnow. Does anyone think of their grandma as a militant? Does anyone \nthink of their grandma as stealing from you? Or, rather, that your \ngrandma thinks much more about you than she does about herself? I can \nassure you that is what we think of our grandmas. They will do anything \nfor us, for their grandchildren. But not Janice Rogers Brown. She \naccuses senior citizens of ``blithely cannibalizing their grandchildren \nbecause they have a right to get as much `free stuff' as the political \nsystem permits them to extract.''\n  What a view of our senior citizens. The greatest generation; the \ngeneration that fought in World War II. And now, getting to be the \ngeneration that fought Vietnam, one of the toughest wars because it was \nso controversial, and the suffering that guess on. These are the folks \nthat are now the grandparents and the senior citizens. They are getting \nas much ``free stuff.'' Why? Because they served in the military and \nthey get veterans' benefits, veterans' health care, and prescription \ndrugs if they are sick. I resent Janice Rogers Brown's statements. I \nresent that statement on behalf of every senior citizen in this \ncountry. You can put lipstick on it, you can put nail polish on it, it \nis still ugly.\n  She calls government ``the drug of choice.'' She even goes after \nrugged midwestern farmers. She says they are looking for big \ngovernment.\n  Who does she know--a rugged midwestern farmer who is looking for the \nGovernment to support them? And ``militant senior citizen.'' Every time \nI say that I think of grandmothers in Army uniforms marching down the \nstreet. These are visions so ridiculous that they have no place being \nbrought into this D.C. Court of Appeals. At the end of the day, that \nmeans there is deep hostility toward our senior citizens, toward our \nworkers, toward our farmers, toward our people.\n  Janice Rogers Brown is way outside the mainstream to the extreme.\n  I hope the American people understand why we held her up for so long. \nThe only reason she is getting the up-or-down vote today is she is part \nof the deal to preserve the filibuster for future out-of-the-mainstream \nfolks. We were on the verge of losing that.\n  She argued that e-mail messages sent by a former employee to \ncoworkers criticizing a company's employment practices were not \nprotected by the first amendment, but she supported corporate speech. \nThat was in Intel v. Hamidi.\n  She argued that a city's rent control ordinance was unconstitutional \nand a result of the ``revolution of 1937.'' The woman is stuck in the \npast. She keeps going back to the New Deal, to 1937. Get over it. The \nthings that worked well, we have continued--such as Social Security, \nminimum wage, or the FDIC, where we protect your deposits. Get over it. \nThe American people demand those minimum protections.\n  But not Janice Rogers Brown. She does not demand it. She argues that \nit was a revolution that the New Deal began. She opposed it and says it \nis all about takings and it is all wrong.\n  Here is an interesting fact. Janice Rogers Brown is on a court with \nsix Republicans and one Democrat. People say, it is California, it is \nCalifornia, everyone there is a liberal Democrat. Wrong. I would not be \nhere if it were not for Republican, Independent voters, and Democratic \nvoters. Here is the deal: She stood alone on a court of six Republicans \nand one Democrat 31 times. Think about it. You are a judge. You are a \nRepublican. You have five Republican colleagues and one Democratic \ncolleague. Yet 31 times you disagreed with those five Republicans and \nthat one Democrat.\n  Who could actually stand up here, look the American people in the \neye, and say she is a mainstream judge? That is just not true, based on \nthe facts. Members can say whatever they want on the Senate floor, and \nI would die for a Members' right to free speech. You can put lipstick \non it, nail polish, and dress it up, but the facts are the facts: She \nstood alone 31 times on a court of six Republicans and one Democrat.\n\n  Maybe it goes back to what the bar said about her, when she was put \nup for her position, that she was unqualified, that she did not \nunderstand legal precedent. Maybe that explains why she stands alone, \nshe does not know what she is doing. Maybe she does not understand it. \nMaybe she does not get it; otherwise, why would she find herself alone \nso many times?\n  Let's go back to what has been said when she was appointed by Pete \nWilson. They received complaints that Brown was ``insensitive to \nestablished legal precedent.'' In a court of appeals, that is a key \nfact. You have to understand what the law is, what has come before. She \n``lacked compassion and intellectual tolerance for opposing views, \nmisunderstood legal standard and was slow to produce opinions.''\n  Maybe she just couldn't follow the reasoning of her colleagues \nbecause she did not understand the legal precedence, or maybe they were \nmoving too fast for her. Or, maybe she chose just not to follow it \nbecause she lacked compassion, and she has no intellectual tolerance \nfor opposing views, even if it is legal precedent.\n  Let's see what else they said:\n\n       She does not possess the minimum qualifications necessary \n     for appointment to the highest court in the State [that is \n     the California State court] the bar commission that reviews \n     judicial nominees told Gov. Pete Wilson in a confidential \n     report.\n\n  This was printed in the ``Los Angeles Times'' April 26, 1996.\n  One would think that the President's men who came up with this idea \nwould have vetted this person. Why did we stop her from getting a vote? \nSimply because we knew the facts. If she wasn't qualified for the \nCalifornia Supreme Court, how does she now get to be qualified for this \nposition? It makes no sense.\n  We will go back to some of the times she stood alone. This case is \nrather remarkable. We have Janice Rogers Brown, a female. A case comes \nbefore her of a woman who was 60 years old. She was a superstar working \nin a hospital, Huntington Memorial Hospital.\n\n[[Page S6200]]\n\nShe was fired from her job based on age discrimination. Janice Rogers \nBrown said:\n\n      . . . discrimination based on age does not mark its victims \n     with a stigma of inferiority and second class citizenship.\n\n  I ask the average American: A 60-year-old employee is perky, who is \nsharp, who is wise, who is experienced, who has gotten stellar reviews, \nwho does better than almost anyone else, but she is fired because \nsomeone in management said, 60, you are out. So she is out of a job. \nAnd this woman had a lot of pride in her work. Maybe it was her whole \nlife, maybe she was so devoted. We know people like that. Janice Rogers \nBrown makes a statement that ``discrimination based on age does not \nmark its victims with a stigma of inferiority and second class \ncitizenship.''\n  Yesterday in the press conference where I was with a lot of minority \nwomen lawyers, one of them, Elaine Jones, made an important point about \nthis case. She said it is fine for Janice Rogers Brown to think that \ndiscrimination based on age does not mark its victim with a stigma of \ninferiority and second class citizenship. If she feels that way, she \nshould run for public office, run for the Senate, go to the House and \nchange the laws we have written which say, in fact, it is a stigma to \nbe the victim of age discrimination. This is hurtful, and it does \nconfer second-class citizenship on the individual.\n\n  Her position is her own opinion. Everyone has a right to his or her \nown opinion. I don't have a problem with that. I don't agree with her. \nI think it is mean. I think it is nasty. I think it hurts our people. \nBut she has a right to think that if she wants. What she does not have \na right to do as a judge is to say that the law we passed simply does \nnot exist. That is why she is so out of the mainstream. We have found \nthat age discrimination brings with it a stigma of inferiority and \nsecond-class citizenship. We have said it is illegal. It is not legal. \nHer position is contrary to State and Federal law and puts her way \noutside the mainstream.\n  And now a look at some of the others. She is the only member of the \ncourt to vote to overturn the conviction of the rapist of a 17-year-old \ngirl because she felt the victim gave mixed messages to the rapist.\n  Maybe my colleagues on the other side want to send someone to this \nvery important court that stands with a rapist against a victim. I \nwouldn't think so. If one reads details of the case, members will be \nshocked by the details. The young woman already was raped once. This \nwas a second rape. The first man pleaded guilty. He claimed innocence, \nbut she was the only member of the court to say this young woman did \nnot have a right to see this rapist confined to prison.\n  It is shocking to me that my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle think this woman is in the mainstream. Is it in the mainstream of \nAmerica to side with a rapist over a 17-year-old girl? Is it in the \nmainstream of America to side with an employer who fires you because \nyou turn 60? It is totally against the State and Federal law.\n  She was the only member of the court to oppose an effort to stop the \nsale of cigarettes to children. That case was Stop Youth Addiction v. \nLucky Stores. There is a reason there is an organization called Stop \nYouth Addiction--because we all know that tobacco is so addictive. When \nyou start young, it is very hard to kick the habit. I am sure everyone \nin this Chamber who has ever smoked knows how hard it is to kick the \nhabit. The younger you start, the more hooked you get.\n  Therefore, parents and others who are advocates are trying to make \nsure they cannot go into the store and purchase cigarettes at an \nunderage level. She was the only member of the court to oppose the \neffort we had going on to ensure that kids do not buy cigarettes.\n  Is that mainstream thought, to go up against parents and families and \nsay it is fine for a retail store to go ahead and sell cigarettes to a \nkid--your kid, my kid, my grandson? That is not mainstream. It is out \nof the mainstream.\n  This woman is out of the mainstream. That is why the Democrats have \nstopped her, until today. We did use the filibuster on her. We were \nglad to use the filibuster on her. If it did not happen that we had \nthis deal, we would still be using the filibuster on her, to protect \nthe people of the United States of America from her kind of values \nwhich stand with a rapist, which stand with the tobacco companies, \nwhich stand with those who discriminate.\n  She can explain in any way she wants. We know the results of her \nthinking. She could come up with a fancy explanation to tell this young \n17-year-old woman, but look her in the eye and say: Well, your rapist \nhas to get out because you didn't say it exactly the right way--when \nevery other member of the court sided with this 17-year-old girl.\n  I am shocked my colleagues are supporting this nominee. And this \nissue is not going to go away. These decisions are not going to go \naway. There are going to be writings about these decisions. There is \ngoing to be discussion about them. People will be held accountable for \ntheir votes here. They should be, one way or the other.\n  If people in my home State are going to write and say, Why are you \nspeaking out against someone from California, a woman who is a \nsharecropper's daughter, I am going to say, That is a good question, \nand let me tell you why. She is out of the mainstream to the extreme, \nand she is hurting our people. It is pretty simple for me.\n  She is bad on discrimination. She is the only member of the court to \nfind that a State fair housing commission could not award certain \ndamages to housing discrimination victims. And how about this? An \nAfrican-American policewoman needed to rent a place and knocked on a \ndoor and had the door slammed in her face--more than once, again and \nagain. She sued for discrimination. Every single member of that court, \nthe highest court in California, ruled in favor of this policewoman--\nexcept Janice Rogers Brown. Oh, no. Oh, no. She said: You do not \ndeserve any damages. You do not deserve any award for what you went \nthrough. Too bad.\n  Now, she may not have written it like that in her statement, but at \nthe end of the day she had to look in this woman's eyes, this \npolicewoman's, and say: Got the door slammed in your face three times? \nToo bad. That is the bottom line with how she ruled. She might as well \nhave said that. And she stood alone. Is that American values? Is that \nmainstream America, that someone would stand on the side of someone who \nslammed the door in the face of someone simply because they did not \nlike their appearance, they did not look like them? Seriously, folks, \nthis is pretty basic American values 101.\n  She is the only member of the court to find that a disabled worker \nwho was the victim of employment discrimination did not have the right \nto raise past instances of discrimination that had occurred. So here is \nsomeone who is saying they were victimized in an employment situation \nbecause they were disabled, they wanted to be able to tell about the \nseries of events that led up to this particular lawsuit, how many times \nthis had happened--she had MS and these discriminatory acts had taken \nplace over many years--and Janice Rogers Brown stood alone and said she \ndid not have the right to raise the past instances of discrimination.\n  Is that an American value, to tell someone who has multiple \nsclerosis, who has been discriminated against for years: Well, we are \nnot interested; we are not interested in hearing about the past; just \nstick to this one case?\n  I do not think, if my colleagues really took the time and the energy \nand the effort to do the kind of work my great staff has done on this--\nand I have to say, I heard Senator Hatch say, well, all this comes \nfrom--what did he say?--liberal groups writing these things. This is \npainstakingly difficult work done by my staff. And they went through it \nbecause I said: Did she ever stand alone--because I knew her reputation \nis so out of the mainstream--did she ever stand alone? And they came \nback to me with this: She stood alone on the side of a rapist. She \nstood alone on the side of people who would discriminate. She stood \nalone on the side of tobacco companies against families. That is how I \nlook at it.\n  She said a manager could use racial slurs against his Latino \nemployees. Can you imagine coming to work every day and having to put \nup with a slur about yourself, about your ethnicity, about your \nreligion, about your disability? There has to be some value\n\n[[Page S6201]]\n\nplaced on human dignity. Well, you do not get it when you look at the \nwritings of Janice Rogers Brown. You do not get it when you look at the \nway she comes down on a lot of these cases.\n  She was the only member of the court who voted to strike down a State \nantidiscrimination law that provided a contraceptive drug benefit to \nwomen. There is a very important law in my State that says if a woman \nwants to get contraceptives through her insurance, she should be \nallowed to. We talk around here a lot about the right to choose and all \nof that. All of us, I would hope, would come together in saying we do \nnot want to see so many abortions. That is right. We want to make sure \nwe reduce the number of abortions. Well, the way you do that is through \ncontraception.\n\n  There was a time and place when contraception use was illegal in this \ncountry, until there was a case in the Supreme Court that was actually \nmemorialized yesterday, the Griswold case, which said: No. It is legal. \nWell, if contraception is legal, why on Earth would we discriminate \nagainst people who try to use their health insurance to get it, their \ndrug benefit to get it?\n  So this case comes before the California Supreme Court, and every \nmember of the court--five Republicans and one Democrat--except her, \nexcept Janice Rogers Brown, says that is an appropriate law. So, again, \nwe have someone out of the mainstream. If she is so out of the \nmainstream on contraception, imagine where she will be on the right to \nprivacy, if she gets into that issue.\n  She is the only member of the court to find that a jury should not \nhear expert testimony in a domestic violence case about ``battered \nwomen's syndrome.'' Now, this one really touches my heart because, \nfortunately, many years ago, Senator Joe Biden phoned me when I was a \nHouse Member, and he said that he had written a bill called the \nViolence Against Women Act. We knew women were being battered and women \nwere being raped. The violence against women was growing, and yet there \nwas no Federal response. We have made tremendous progress in this area. \nWe still have a long way to go.\n  Mr. President, I have been asked a question. I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. As we learned more about stopping violence against women, \nwe found out something very ugly, which is sometimes women are in such \na desperate circumstance, after being battered for so long, that they \nlose their center and their balance and they fight back. Sometimes you \nwill have a case that comes before a court, and in defending a woman \nthey want to bring in an expert to talk about battered women syndrome--\nwhy is it that a woman, who is otherwise peaceful, otherwise decent, \nwith no criminal record, no criminal history, would suddenly break out \nand do violence to another.\n  If you do not understand battered women syndrome, it makes it \ndifficult. Janice Rogers Brown was the only member of the court to say \na jury should not hear expert testimony in a domestic violence case \nabout ``battered women's syndrome''--the only one. How is that in the \nmainstream of thinking? How is that in the mainstream of American \nvalues? How is that going to help us learn more about why people would \nact in a certain way? It does not say how a jury has to find. They just \nwanted to have this testimony. All of her colleagues found it would be \nperfectly appropriate. Not Janice Rogers Brown--out of the mainstream, \nin the extreme, standing alone time after time.\n  Janice Rogers Brown, the only member of the court who voted to bar an \nemployee from suing for sexual harassment because she had signed a \nstandard workers' compensation release form. She was the only member of \nthe court who said: You do not have the right to sue if you have been \nsexually harassed because you have already signed a workers' comp \nrelease form. They are two different things. Yet for her, no, it was \none and the same, and she stood alone in this case as well.\n  She was the only member of the court to find nothing improper about \nrequiring a criminal defendant to wear a 50,000 volt stun belt while \ntestifying. I think we discussed the fact that the U.S. Supreme Court \nrecently made a judgment on this, that it is very important, in order \nto have a fair trial--and in America that is what we believe in.\n  Now, I, myself, am very tough on a criminal. I would do the worst of \nthe worst to someone convicted of a heinous crime because I believe \npeople give up their right to be among us if they commit a heinous \ncrime. So I am very tough. At the same time, I understand you do not \nwant to do something that would prejudice a case. When you bring \nsomeone into court, before they have been found guilty of anything, and \nthey are wearing a 50,000 volt stun belt, it may give a message to the \njury. And that may just result in an overturning of a conviction later \non.\n  So the California Supreme Court found, except for Janice Rogers \nBrown, it was a mistake. She stood alone.\n  So let me finish up in this way. It is really an extraordinary \nnomination, this particular nomination. When the Democrats stood tall \nagainst this nominee, there were reasons. There were reasons we stood \ntall against 10 nominees. We allowed 208 to move forward, but we stood \nagainst 10. We stood against 10 and said: Do you know what. We are \ngoing to follow historic precedent. If we believe these nominees are \nout of the mainstream, we are going to stand and be counted.\n  It is not pleasant. It is not nice. It is not enjoyable. It is not \nsomething anyone looks forward to.\n  It is unusual to do it, and we did it 10 times. We gave this \nPresident a 95-percent ``yes'' record of judge confirmations, but he is \nnot a happy camper unless he gets 100 percent. If I got 95 percent of \nthe vote, I would be soaring high. If I got 95 percent of my bills \npassed through here, I would be soaring high. I would be so happy if my \nkids listened to me 95 percent of the time. I would be smiling. I would \nsay: Yes, I think you are wrong on that 5 percent, but I feel good \nabout it.\n  Not this President; he wants 100 percent. It is called the arrogance \nof power. It is called one-party rule. I think the American people want \nto be governed, not ruled. We had a King George once. It didn't work \nout very well. We like President George better than King George. But \nPresident George, as every President, whether it was Bill or Harry or \nyou name it--some day it will be a woman, I can hope--every President \nwho reads the Constitution knows there is an advice and consent clause. \nThat means when you put people up for these lifetime appointments, the \nSenate has an important role to play. And instead of being annoyed \nabout it, instead of being bothered about it, instead of feeling it is \ncramping your style, you should use your power, your effectiveness, \nyour political capital, your charm, use whatever you have to come over \nto the Senate, to sit down with Senators, to say: Look, I am thinking \nof putting up Mr. X or Mrs. X. What do you think?\n  It is frustrating because early in the Bush Presidency, Alberto \nGonzales, who was the White House counsel, came over and he did say to \nme--because I was against a Ninth Circuit Court nominee--do you have \nany good ideas for who else you might support? I did. I talked to my \npeople, to my Republican supporters. We came in. We had six terrific \nRepublican names. We sent them. Nothing. So they asked, but they never \nacted. Some of these people were quite conservative. I think they would \nhave been pleased. But this seems to be an administration that wants \n100 percent of what they want. They don't want the shared \nresponsibility of governing. Either they don't want or they don't \nunderstand or they don't like the balance of powers, which is such a \ncenterpiece of our Government.\n  We see it on the Bolton nomination as well. That is not for a \njudgeship. That is a nomination for U.N. ambassador. But, again, if we \ncould just talk to each other, we could come up with someone who would \nbe terrific, instead of having these standoffs, which are difficult. \nThey are not pleasant. We are not getting a lot of work done because of \nhow much time we are talking about Janice Rogers Brown, because many of \nus believe she is so out of the mainstream, we can't let it go. That is \nwhy\n\n[[Page S6202]]\n\nI so respect the moderates who came up with the agreement because part \nof that agreement said in the future the President should talk to us \nmore, especially about Supreme Court nominees.\n  We are at a place and time where we have proven one point, that when \nwe stood up against these 10 judges and allowed 208 to go through, it \nwasn't arbitrary or capricious or nasty or personal. It was because \nthese people are out of the mainstream. I well remember when George \nBush was declared the winner in 2000, he came right out and said: I am \ngoing to govern from the middle.\n  Here is where we are: George Will, `` `Extraordinary' Rhetoric.'' \nGeorge Will calls Janice Rogers Brown out of the mainstream. George \nWill is very rightwing and he calls her out of the mainstream. He says \nit is a fact that she is out of the mainstream.\n  The Mercury News says:\n\n       As an appellate judge who would hear the bulk of challenges \n     to Federal laws coming out of Washington, Janice Rogers \n     Brown's appointment would be disastrous. She'd be likely to \n     strike down critical environmental, labor laws and \n     antidiscrimination protections. Brown, though, has infused \n     her legal opinions with her ideology, ignoring higher court \n     rulings that should temper her judgment.\n\n  That was the from San Jose Mercury News, a very mainstream newspaper \nin Silicon Valley.\n  From the Sacramento Bee that sits in the heart of the capital of \nCalifornia:\n\n       The minority in the Senate certainly is justified in \n     filibustering a lifetime appointment of Brown.\n      . . . The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \n     Circuit is the last place we need a judge who would impose \n     19th century economic theory on the Constitution and 21st \n     century problems.\n       The issue isn't Brown's qualifications; it's her judicial \n     philosophy.\n\n  I see my friend from Colorado is here. I will stop now and thank him \nfor the work he did on that compromise on the filibuster. I was not a \nhappy person that Janice Rogers Brown was in the group, but our side \nhad to give up something. I have spent days expressing why I hope there \nwill be a strong vote against her. She is out of the mainstream.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the balance of my time to Senator \nSalazar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia for her eloquent statement concerning Janice Rogers Brown.\n  I rise today to state my opposition to her confirmation to serve as a \njudge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. I have \ncarefully considered her record and have unfortunately concluded that \nMs. Brown is not the right choice to serve as a judge on the District \nof Columbia Federal court.\n  I have had the privilege of extensive experience in judicial \nselection in the State of Colorado, both for the Federal and State \ncourts. For the years when I served the Governor of Colorado as his \nlawyer, I administered for the Governor the process of choosing judges \nin Colorado. When I later served as attorney general for my State, I \nchose, with Governor Owens and the chief justice of Colorado, those who \ncould select judges under Colorado's Constitution.\n  My views on the qualifications of judges to serve on any court have \nbeen forged over years of working on judicial selections. Among the \nmost important characteristics we rightly demand of our Federal judges \nare that they have an open mind, are free from bias, and a temperament \nthat does not inflame passions. Janice Rogers Brown, in my view, fails \nthese tests.\n  First, I do not think Ms. Brown will be fair in the ways a Federal \njudge must be fair. I have come to believe Ms. Brown is driven \nideologically and that she will prejudge some of the most important \nlegal cases and issues that come before a Federal appellate court. I \nbase my conclusions on her written record and on her own statements. \nWhen any person has a case to bring before a Federal judge on any \nissue, that person has a right to insist that the judge will listen \ncarefully to all the arguments on the facts and the law with an \nespecially fair and open mind that considers carefully all the points \nmade on every subject, pro or con. This right to absolute fairness by a \nFederal tribunal is a bedrock of our constitutional judicial system. It \nis just commonsense, and it is an idea that is very well understood by \neveryone in this Nation.\n  There is another simple way to say this. No one wants to walk into \ncourt before a case is heard and know already how the judge is going to \nrule. Yet this is exactly the problem with Janice Rogers Brown. She is \nso driven by her ideology on issues such as the proper role of the \nGovernment and administrative agencies--or the role of ideas of private \nproperty that separates constitutional and unconstitutional government \nregulation--that it is very obvious how Ms. Brown is going to rule on \nthese matters, even before she hears a case.\n  There are many quotes from Ms. Brown that illustrate this point. A \ngood example is from a speech to the Federalist Society on April 20, \n2000, where she said:\n\n       Where government moves in, community retreats, civil \n     society disintegrates and our ability to control our own \n     destiny atrophies. The result is: families under siege; war \n     in the streets; unapologetic expropriation of property; the \n     precipitous decline of the rule of law; the rapid rise of \n     corruption; the loss of civility and the triumph of deceit. \n     The result is a debased, debauched culture which finds moral \n     depravity entertaining and virtue contemptible.\n\n  These are extreme views, to say the least.\n  Second, Ms. Brown is an activist judge. From my review of her record, \nI believe she will use the court as a vehicle to forward her own \npersonal view of the law in society. She has done it consistently in \nthe past. I believe that is the role of a legislator, not the role of a \njudge. I believe that kind of judicial activism is absolutely wrong in \nour courts, no matter what ideology it spawns from.\n  Third, I believe Janice Rogers Brown does not have the right \ntemperament to be a judge on the Federal appellate bench. When a person \naccepts the solemn mantle of the robes and the duties of the judiciary, \nI believe she must agree by temperament to place her own personal legal \nand social views in the background. She must accept that while a judge, \nthough she can have her own personal views, she must not cause people \nto perceive her as unfair, if she is as strident about those views as \nshe has been demonstrated by her record.\n  Again, Janice Rogers Brown does not meet the test of the temperament \nof someone to be on the Circuit Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. \nI believe litigants and others who watch the judiciary are correct to \nperceive that Janice Rogers Brown may not treat them fairly as she \nconsiders a particular case against the backdrop of her own personal \nviews that are obviously so strongly felt.\n  I also believe Ms. Brown is nominated to serve on the wrong court. \nShe is nominated to serve on the appellate court where her ideology can \ndo the most damage to our Federal and State governments.\n  The Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia is our \nNation's most prestigious court of appeals with regard to all matters \ndealing with Government. Through venue provisions found throughout the \nFederal statutes, Congress often and intentionally chooses this court \nexclusively to hear matters concerning Government agencies. These are \nlegal matters that go to the very heart of how our Government operates \nthrough our administrative agencies, agencies that affect the lives of \nour citizens every day all across our country.\n\n  The District of Columbia court is our Nation's expert court in \nadministrative law. While that is an abstract legal concept, it is also \na very important matter to all ordinary citizens in Colorado and across \nthe Nation.\n  Yet Janice Rogers Brown is absolutely hostile to our Government and \nto administrative agencies and to their essential work. Janice Rogers \nBrown is the wrong person to elevate to this important Federal \nappellate court. It is for these reasons that I will vote to oppose the \nnomination of Janice Rogers Brown to the District of Columbia Court of \nAppeals.\n  I also want to add another quick point. As I have listened to the \ndebate here on the floor of the Senate today, there has been some \nsentiment expressed that perhaps the opposition of some of my \ncolleagues in the Democratic caucus has to do with her background, with \nthe fact that she is African American. I will tell you, from the\n\n[[Page S6203]]\n\nwork of my colleagues on this side of the aisle, they have been \nchampions of opportunity for all people, they believe we live in \nAmerica, that we should be talking about uniting our country and not \ndividing our country, and yet it is a nomination of Janice Rogers \nBrown, with her views of activism in the Federal court, which they have \ncalled appropriately into question and which some of my colleagues on \nthe other side have now been saying somehow has the Democratic caucus \nas being anti-African American.\n  There could be nothing further from the truth. The opposition that \nhas been voiced against Janice Rogers Brown has nothing to do with her \npersonal ethnicity. It has to do with the fact that the conclusions \nthat have been reached based on a review of her record indicate that \nshe will inject her own personal views as an activist judge into the \nD.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Therefore, I again reiterate my position \nthat I will vote against her confirmation, and I urge my colleagues in \nthe Senate to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to express my \nopposition to the nomination of Janice Rogers Brown to the D.C. Circuit \nCourt of Appeals.\n  The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals is considered the second highest \ncourt in the Nation. This court of appeals, compared to other circuit \ncourts of appeals, has sole jurisdiction over many laws and Federal \nagency regulations and decisions. Given the limited number of cases the \nU.S. Supreme Court considers every year, this means the DC Circuit \nCourt of Appeals has the last word on important laws and their \ninterpretation.\n  Justice Janice Rogers Brown has a compelling life story, but a \ncompelling life story is not enough to be confirmed to a lifetime \nappointment to the federal bench. While she deserves recognition for \nher upbringing and work in the community, I am concerned that Justice \nBrown's personal opinion, rather than the law, compels her decisions in \nsome cases.\n  Some other areas of concern I have with Justice Brown's nomination \ninclude:\n  Justice Brown has advocated for a return to the time when the Supreme \nCourt struck down many important economic regulations and workplace \nlaws on constitutional grounds. The case is Santa Monica Beach v. Sup. \nCt. of LA County, 1999, dissenting.\n  Justice Brown has argued that those seeking to enforce the statutory \nprohibition against disability discrimination are ``individuals whose \nonly concern is their own narrow interest.'' The case is Richards v. \nCH2M Hill, Inc., 2001, dissenting.\n  Justice Brown has ignored or misconstrued Supreme Court precedent and \nlegislative language to reach her decisions. The cases are San Remo \nHotel v. City-County of San Francisco, 2002, dissenting; Richards v. \nCH2M Hill, Inc., 2001, dissenting; Catholic Charities of Sacramento v. \nSuperior Court of Sacramento County, 2004, dissenting.\n  Justice Brown has stated in a lone dissent concerning the State \nstatute requiring prescription contraceptive coverage that if the \ncorporation's female employees do not like being discriminated against, \nthey are free to find, ``more congenial employment.'' The case is \nCatholic Charities of Sacramento v. Superior Court of Sacramento \nCounty, 2004, dissenting.\n  Taken individually, these stances might not be cause for some to \noppose this nomination. However, looking at the whole picture I believe \nthere is a pattern of behavior that leads me to conclude that Justice \nBrown is not qualified to serve on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. \nFor these reasons, I opposed limiting debate on her nomination in 2003, \nand continue to do so today.\n  Unfortunately, I will be necessarily absent for the votes that will \noccur related to this nominee. However, I did feel it necessary to \nexpress my position on this important nomination.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues in the U.S. \nSenate to reject the nomination of Janice Rogers Brown to the District \nof Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals. I strenuously oppose this \nnomination because I believe that her appointment to a lifetime tenured \nposition on the D.C. Circuit Court will lead to the destruction of so \nmany of the achievements we have struggled to achieve during the past \n70 years--the creation of a social safety net, the advancement of civil \nrights for all Americans, and the protection of workers throughout our \ncountry. When I say achievements I am talking about many of the laws \npassed by the U.S. Congress, for during the past 70 years we have \ncreated the heart of what is today our modern American government. \nCongress has set the standard for our Nation--from social security and \nminimum-wage laws to homeland security and regulation of the business \nindustry--by establishing laws that provide tremendous benefits and \nprotections for all Americans.\n  I am deeply troubled by the nomination of Janice Rogers Brown, a \njurist who has made no secret of her disdain for government and her \ndesire to overturn many of the most important laws passed by Congress \nduring the past 70 years. She will dismantle the foundation of our \ndemocracy, challenging the right of Congress to pass laws to help our \ncitizens. Keep in mind that when I speak about Congress, I am not \ndiscussing people from one political party or the other; rather, I \nspeak of the collective will of the American people, which is forged so \noften through bipartisan agreement and compromise between legislators \nfrom both political parties. And so I ask, who is Justice Brown to try \nto dismantle the very laws that we have forged over time through debate \nand consensus to protect our rights and keep us safe in America today?\n  During the past 9 years, Justice Brown has made her legal philosophy \nclear through both her public speeches and her legal opinions as a \nJustice on the California Supreme Court. She has, time and time again, \ndemonstrated that she will be a movement judge--someone who will \ndetermine the ultimate outcome of a case based on her political beliefs \ninstead of on the facts and law before her. Justice Brown has been \ninconsistent in her interpretation of the law, following precedent when \nit helps her to arrive at a desired result and rejecting precedent as \nnon-binding when it will not achieve her desired ends. This is \nprecisely the type of individual who should not receive a seat on the \nD.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is considered the second highest \ncourt in the country and a stepping-stone to a seat on the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n  We should not approve any individual for a lifetime tenure position \nas a Federal judge who would use her position to achieve results \nconsistent with an extreme political philosophy regardless of the facts \nand law. And I believe this to be true regardless of what the extreme \npolitical philosophy may be. Our goal must always be to ensure the \nindependence and fairness of our courts. This is the very reason that \nFederal judges receive lifetime appointments: to guarantee that they \nwill not be susceptible to political pressure or undue influence. Our \ngoal must be to sustain this level of independence so that all citizens \ncan be confident that, when they bring a case in Federal court, they \nwill receive a fair hearing, based on the facts and law and not upon \none individual's political beliefs.\n\n  We must place the value of an independent judiciary above the \npartisan politics of the day and refuse to approve purely partisan \npolitical nominees such as Janice Rogers Brown. The U.S. Senate has a \nconstitutional obligation to advise the President on judicial \nnominations. As part of this obligation, the Senate must fight to \nensure the continued existence of an independent and fair judiciary. We \nmust never forget that our courts depend, first and foremost, on the \njudges who hear arguments, preside over trials, and issue rulings each \nand every day. The only way we can maintain a strong judiciary is if we \napprove only the most qualified individuals to lifetime appointments as \nFederal judges. And so we must approve nominees who possess the very \ntraits we value most in our judiciary--fairness, independence, and an \nallegiance to the rule of law. That is why I urge my colleagues to \nreject Janice Rogers Brown, an individual who has consistently failed \nto demonstrate these traits. An individual who would, in my view, \ninsert her extremist legal\n\n[[Page S6204]]\n\nphilosophy into the courts in an attempt to undo years of Congressional \nlegislation and legal precedent.\n  There should be no doubt that Justice Brown espouses an extreme legal \nphilosophy far outside the mainstream of American legal thought. The \nPresident has selected a number of appellate court nominees, including \nJustice Brown, who embrace a radical legal theory frequently referred \nto as the ``Constitution in Exile.'' The ``Constitution in Exile'' \ntheory is based on arguments put forth by Judge Douglas Ginsburg and \nProfessor Richard Epstein. Ginsburg and Epstein believe that \nindividuals have certain rights and liberties, including ``economic \nliberties'', and that any government that infringes upon these so-\ncalled liberties is ``repressive.'' This theory, advocated by Justice \nBrown, argues that the U.S. government represses its citizens when it \ntakes land to build schools and pays the owner fair market value, \nestablishes worker safety and minimum-wage laws, and institutes zoning \nand other regulations. Indeed, the ``Constitution in Exile'' theorists \ncall into question the decisions of some of the most important \ngovernment agencies--the EPA, the FCC, the SEC, and even the Federal \nReserve--and argue that these agencies are themselves unconstitutional.\n  This legal theory is so far outside the mainstream that even the most \nconservative jurists on the U.S. Supreme Court recently rejected its \npremise. A unanimous Supreme Court--including conservative justices \nsuch as Scalia and Thomas, with whom I don't generally agree--handed \ndown a decision on May 23, 2005, in Lingle v. Chevron, No. 04-163,--\nS.Ct.--, 2005 WL 1200710 (May 23, 2005) that squarely rejects the \n``economic liberty'' theory of takings asserted by ``Constitution in \nExile'' theorists.\n  Lingle addressed questions of economic liberty in the context of \nchallenges to Hawaii's rent-control regulations. The case tested \nwhether the ``Constitution in Exile'' theory operates within the \nmainstream of American legal thought because advocates of the theory, \nincluding Richard Epstein, argued that the Supreme Court should look \nmore critically on economic regulations and give less deference to \nlegislative judgments. The Supreme Court strongly rejected this \napproach; writing for the Court, Justice O'Connor dismissed the \nargument that the Court should adopt a more critical approach to \neconomic regulations and noted the strong need for deference to the \njudgment of state legislatures. O'Connor further stated that \n``'government regulation--by definition--involves the adjustment of \nrights for the public good.''\n  Lingle demonstrates that Justice Brown stands far outside the legal \nmainstream. Beyond the defeat of the general principles espoused by the \n``Constitution in Exile'' theorists, the Lingle decision serves as an \nexplicit rejection of the legal theory set forth by Justice Brown in a \nlone dissent--one of her many--on the California Supreme Court. In San \nRemo Hotel L.P. v. City and County of San Francisco, a case contesting \nthe legality of a San Francisco development fee used to promote \naffordable housing, Justice Brown issued a dissent espousing the same \nlegal argument outlined by Epstein in Lingle--that the court should \nlook more critically on economic regulations and give less weight to \nthe wishes of the legislature. In rejecting the principles of the \nConstitution in Exile theorists, the Supreme Court explicitly rejected \nthe argument set forth by Justice Brown in her San Remo dissent. \nAlthough there should be no need for additional evidence that Justice \nBrown's legal philosophy falls outside of the mainstream, the decision \nin Lingle provides powerful proof that Justice Brown falls far outside \nthe boundaries of established legal thought.\n  For all these reasons, let me again urge my fellow colleagues to \nreject the nomination of Janice Rogers Brown. We must reject extremist \njudges like this who fall outside of the mainstream and who will use \nthe federal judiciary to dismantle so many of the progressive \naccomplishments we have fought so hard to achieve during the past 70 \nyears.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, of all the nominations contested in \nthe past few weeks, Justice Brown's is the clearest cut. Justice Brown \nhas given numerous speeches over the years that express an extreme \nideology that is far outside the mainstream of American jurisprudence. \nIn those speeches, Justice Brown used stark hyperbole, and startlingly \nvitriolic language which has been surprising, especially for a State \nsupreme court justice.\n  But statements alone would not be enough for me to oppose her \nnomination. Rather, my concern is that her personal views drive her \nlegal decisionmaking. On far too many occasions, she has issued legal \nopinions based on her personal beliefs, rather than existing legal \nprecedent.\n  I am troubled that Justice Brown is bound by her personal views of \nwhat the law should be rather than following the law as written and \nenacted. This is especially troubling for a candidate who is being \nnominated to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  The D.C. Circuit is an especially important court in our Nation's \njudicial system. It is recognized as the most prestigious and powerful \nappellate court below the Supreme Court because of its exclusive \njurisdiction over constitutional rights and government regulations.\n  Given this exclusive role, the judges serving on this court play a \nspecial role in evaluating government actions.\n  Each year, the Supreme Court routinely reviews fewer than 100 cases. \nTherefore, circuit courts, like the D.C. Circuit, end up as the forums \nof last resort for nearly 30,000 cases each year. These cases affect \nthe interpretation of the Constitution as well as statutes intended by \nCongress to protect the rights of all Americans, such as the right to \nequal protection of the laws and the right to privacy. Specifically, \nthe D.C. Circuit Court is the most likely venue where Federal \nregulations and government actions will be upheld or overturned.\n  Yet Justice Brown, throughout her career, has demonstrated an open \nhostility towards government. This hostility is concerning given that, \nif Justice Brown serves on the D.C. Circuit, she will play a decisive \nrole in evaluating government actions.\n  For example:\n  In a 1999 speech Justice Brown stated:\n\n       My thesis is simple. Where government advances--and it \n     advances relentlessly--freedom is imperiled; community \n     impoverished; religion marginalized; and civilization itself \n     marginalized.\n\n  At a 2000 Federalist Society event, Justice Brown stated:\n\n       Where government moves in, community retreats, civil \n     society disintegrates, and our ability to control our own \n     destiny atrophies. The result is: families under siege; war \n     in the streets; unapologetic expropriation of property; the \n     precipitous decline of the rule of law; the rapid rise of \n     corruption; the loss of civility and the triumph of deceit. \n     The result is a debased, debauched, culture which finds moral \n     depravity entertaining and virtue contemptible.\n\n  The Senate should not confirm a judge to this important court who has \nshown such blatant contempt for the government. Again, to be clear, if \nit were only hyperbolic statements in speeches then maybe we could look \npast the rhetoric. However, the extreme views expressed in Justice \nBrown's speeches also emerge in the opinions she has rendered as a \njudge.\n  In various cases involving even modest government regulations she has \nissued opinions that ignore the law and established precedent.\n  One example I would like to discuss involves a property issue in my \nhome city, San Francisco, and it is a case with which I am familiar \nsince the ordinance was enacted during the time I served in San \nFrancisco's government.\n  The case is San Remo Hotel v. San Francisco. In response to a low-\nincome housing emergency for elderly residents, San Francisco enacted \nan ordinance requiring hotels to obtain a permit before converting \nlong-term residential housing into short-term tourist hotel rooms.\n  To obtain a permit, hotels either had to provide mitigation for the \nremoval of the residential rooms by offering alternative housing, or \npay a fee to be used for the relocation of tenants. In San Remo Hotel \nv. San Francisco, the owners of a hotel sued the City of San Francisco, \nclaiming that the ordinance constituted an illegal ``taking'' of \nproperty by the city.\n  Following U.S. Supreme Court precedent, the California Supreme Court\n\n[[Page S6205]]\n\nheld that the ordinance did not constitute a ``taking'' of the hotel's \nproperty since the ordinance did not physically ``invade'' the property \nand since the ordinance ``substantially advance[d] legitimate state \ninterests.''\n  In contrast, Justice Brown wrote in her dissent in the San Remo case \nthat:\n\n       Private property, already an endangered species in \n     California, is now entirely extinct in San Francisco. The \n     City and County of San Francisco has implemented a neo-feudal \n     regime where the nominal owner of property must use that \n     property according to the preferences of majorities that \n     prevail in the political process--or worse, the political \n     powerbrokers who often control the government independently \n     of majoritarian preferences.\n\n  The majority described Justice Brown's dissenting opinion by saying \nthat she argued, with little citation or support, that ``government \nshould regulate property only through rules that the affected owners \nwould agree indirectly enhance the value of their properties.''\n  If this view were the law it would make it almost impossible for any \ncity, State, or local government to make any policies for the benefit \nof the community as a whole. No local government could downzone \nproperty, no Federal agency could prepare a habitat conservation plan. \nUnder Justice Brown's analysis they would all be illegal takings of one \nkind or another.\n  The majority decision of the California Supreme Court went on to \ncriticize Justice Brown for attempting to ``impose'' her own ``personal \ntheory of political economy on the people of a democratic state.''\n  Furthermore, Justice Brown's written opinion was at odds with the \ncurrent legal precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court at that time. And, in \nfact, earlier this year, Lingle v. Chevron, the U.S. Supreme Court \nunanimously rejected a takings analysis similar to the one set forth in \nBrown's dissent in San Remo.\n  Nevertheless, Justice Brown permitted her personal views to overwhelm \nher obligation as a judge to follow the law. While Justice Brown \ncertainly has a right to private views that may conflict with the law, \na judge may not substitute her personal opinions for the law.\n  I also believe it is illuminating to put Justice Brown's views and \nlegal opinions in the context of the court of which she is a member.\n  Justice Brown often stands on an island by herself as the lone \ndissenter on a court made up of six Republican justices and only one \nDemocratic justice--approximately one-third of the cases she has \nwritten have been dissents, and in 10 percent of those cases, she has \nbeen the lone dissenter.\n  For example, in the 2004 case of Catholic Charities of Sacramento v. \nSuperior Court of Sacramento County, Justice Brown cast the sole \ndissenting vote. She argued against upholding a State statute that \nrequires employers whose insurance covers prescription drugs to include \nprescription contraceptives in their coverage. In her dissent, she \nsuggested that, if women had a problem with their inequitable \ntreatment, they were free to find ``more congenial employment,'' and \nstated that because women seeking contraception were a minority of \ninsured employees, striking down the law would have a ``negligible \neffect.''\n  Based on her pattern of taking this contrarian role, she has been \nwidely criticized, even among her Republican colleagues, for her \ncaustic writings. Sources on the court reportedly stated that her \nfellow justices have privately complained about her ``poison pen'' and \nhave called Justice Brown a ``loose cannon when she has a typewriter in \nfront of her.''\n  Republican Chief Justice Ronald M. George has even taken the unusual \nstep of pulling her aside and asking her to tone down her scathing \ncriticism of majority rulings.\n  In addition to her tone, her legal reasoning has often been \ncriticized by her colleagues. In one example, Nike v. Kasky, Nike was \naccused of providing abusive conditions for their overseas workers \nincluding forced overtime, exposing workers to health hazards, and \nsubjecting workers to verbal, physical and sexual mistreatment.\n  Nike denied the mistreatment and made numerous statements touting a \npositive record and was sued for misrepresenting its labor practices at \nAsian factories.\n  The majority of the California Supreme Court determined the \nstatements made by Nike were commercial speech and thus entitled to \nless constitutional protection.\n  Justice Brown dissented, saying the speech should have been protected \neven if false. In her dissent, Brown called on the U.S. Supreme Court \nto overturn a long line of cases which distinguish commercial and \nnoncommercial speech.\n  Republican Justice Kenard criticized Brown's dissent, saying:\n\n       Sprinkled with references to a series of children's books \n     about wizardry and sorcery, Justice Brown's dissent itself \n     tries to find the magic formula or incantation that will \n     transform a business enterprise's factual representations in \n     defense of its own products and profits into noncommercial \n     speech exempt from our state's consumer protection laws.\n\n  I am deeply troubled when a Justice's own colleagues express grave \nconcerns about an individual's legal reasoning, and demonstrate a \nwillingness to openly criticize a fellow member of the bench.\n  An overarching principle of both Republicans and Democrats is that \nthe role of a judge is to follow the law, regardless of one's personal \nideology. Yet, repeatedly, Justice Brown has allowed her personal \nopinion to override a fair application of the law and has altered her \nlegal reasoning in order to achieve a desired result. Law school \nprofessor Gerald Uelmen said that Justice Brown's opinions may be \ninterpreted as ``motivated by politics rather than the law.''\n  When examining her record, it appears that the thread of logic sewn \nthrough her legal opinions is her desire to achieve a predetermined \noutcome based on her personal views. In case after case, Justice Brown \nsignificantly changes her legal reasoning to implement a results-\noriented approach based on her view of what the law should be.\n  When Justice Brown wanted to limit the explicit right to privacy in \nCalifornia's Constitution, she argued: ``Where, as here, a state \nconstitutional protection was modeled on a Federal constitutional \nright, we should be extremely reticent to disregard U.S. Supreme Court \nprecedent delineating the scope and contours of that right.''\n  But when the question of remedies for a violation of constitutional \nrights arose, she said: ``Defaulting to the high court fundamentally \ndisserves the independent force and effect of our Constitution. Rather \nthan enrich the texture of our law, this reliance on Federal precedent \nshortchanges future generations.''\n  These cases both involved the role of precedent and following the \ndecisions of previous courts. However, depending on the facts of the \ncase Justice Brown changed her legal opinion about whether judges \nshould follow precedent; in one case she discussed the importance of \nfollowing precedent, yet in the other she argued that reliance on \nprecedent can be harmful.\n  When examining the role of juries and their ability to evaluate a \ncase, once again, Justice Brown makes conflicting arguments.\n  In order to limit damages against employers in worker discrimination \nsuits, Brown wrote:\n\n       When setting punitive damages, a jury does not have the \n     perspective, and the resulting sense of proportionality, that \n     a court has after observing many trials.\n\n  But, when criminal defendants' cases--not businesses--were being \nevaluated, Justice Brown wrote:\n\n       I do not share the majority's dim view of jurors. Rather, I \n     would presume, as we do in virtually every other context, \n     that jurors are intelligent, capable of understanding \n     instructions and applying them to the facts of the case.\n\n  Justice Brown's conflicting legal reasoning also appears when her \ndecisions examine the assessment of damages. When the plaintiffs were \nvictims of employment discrimination, Justice Brown supported limits on \npunitive damages. But, when the plaintiffs were property owners in a \nmobile home park who had to previously abide by rent control laws, she \nopposed any limit on damages.\n  In each of these contrasting examples, Justice Brown has used legal \nreasoning that has conflicted. It is concerning when a judge seems to \nalter her legal reasoning based on her personal view of a case, rather \nthan employing consistent legal reasoning regardless of who is making \nthe argument, or who would be impacted by its effect.\n\n[[Page S6206]]\n\n  Based on this record, parties in a case have no idea whether Justice \nBrown will rely on precedent or decide it is an impediment, whether she \nwill defer to the legislature or decide it's time for her or other \njudges to make law; whether she will trust the jury to evaluate the \ncase or decide they cannot make the necessary evaluations; or whether \nshe will protect unlimited damages or order that there needs to be \nlimits on damages.\n  Those who come before a court need to be assured that they are going \nto be given a fair hearing with an impartial arbiter. Justice Brown's \nrecord demonstrates that those who come before her court will not have \nsuch assurances.\n  Not surprisingly, Justice Brown's nomination has ignited strong and \nfar-reaching opposition. Both Senators from her home State and almost \ntwo dozen members of California's congressional delegation oppose her \nnomination.\n  The Congressional Black Caucus opposes her nomination, as does every \nmajor African American organization in the country, including the \nNational Black Chamber of Commerce, NAACP, the National Bar \nAssociation, the California Association of Black Lawyers, and the \nLeadership Conference on Civil Rights.\n  The California Association of Black Lawyers stated:\n\n       We would like to see an African American female be elevated \n     to a higher court.\n\n  But as the group's president went on to explain:\n\n       We do not see how we can support someone who is \n     diametrically opposed to our goals.\n\n  In adddition, unlikely conservative commentators have affirmed \nconcerns raised by opponents of Justice Brown's nomination:\n\n       National Review Senior Editor Romesh Ponnuru discussed \n     Brown's troubling statements and her willingness to embrace \n     judicial activism and concluded that ``if a liberal nominee \n     to the courts said similar things, conservatives would make \n     quick work of her.''\n\n  George Will concluded that Justice Brown is ``outside of that \nmainstream'' of conservative jurisprudence; and\n  Conservative columnist Andrew Sullivan wrote:\n\n       Whatever else she is, she does not fit the description of a \n     judge who simply applies the law. If she isn't a `judicial \n     activist,' I don't know who would be.\n\n  Evaluating judicial nominations is a very difficult process, and it \nis one that ignites passionate feelings from all sides. Clearly, \nPresidents from different parties will choose very different nominees \nfor the Federal courts. However, there are basic principles that every \nnominee must follow regardless of which party is in power.\n  As Senator Hatch stated in 1996 when opposing the confirmation of \nJudge H. Lee Sarokin to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit \nand Judge Rosemary Barkett to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nEleventh Circuit:\n\n       Many of these judges are activists who simply cannot \n     understand that their role is to interpret the law, not to \n     make it . . . I led the fight to oppose the confirmation of \n     these two judges because their judicial records indicated \n     that they would be activists who would legislate from the \n     bench.\n\n  Legislating from the bench, being an ``activist'' judge, has been a \nconcern of members of both parties. It is a basic principle used when \nevaluating nominees--judges must follow the law, not manipulate the law \nto serve their own political ideology.\n  As I have discussed today, Janice Rogers Brown is widely opposed by a \nbroad coalition of prominent leaders and organizations, she has been \ncriticized by her Republican colleagues on the court, and she has made \nastoundingly vitriolic statements about everything from senior citizens \nto the government.\n  While each of these concerns raises significant questions about her \nqualifications to serve on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, for me, \nmost importantly, Janice Rogers Brown does not meet the basic principle \nused to evaluate judicial nominees by both parties--will they follow \nthe law?\n  Unfortunately, Janice Rogers Brown's record does not demonstrate that \nshe will be able to put aside her personal views and follow the law.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I oppose the confirmation of Justice Janice \nRogers Brown to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. It is \nunfortunate that the President has chosen to resubmit for our \nconsideration this failed nomination from the President's first term. \nBoth in her public record on the California Supreme Court and in her \nwritings and speeches off the bench, Justice Brown has compiled a \nremarkable record of extremism, of ideologically motivated decision \nmaking, of intemperance in her public statements, and of a judicial \nphilosophy unquestionably out of the mainstream. Such a record makes \nher entirely unsuitable for a life tenured position on the D.C. \nCircuit.\n  Justice Brown's extraordinary views on the role and nature of \ngovernment convince me that there is a substantial risk that her views \nand legal philosophy are so far outside the mainstream as to pose a \nvery real threat to our civil rights and civil liberties. Her views on \nthe role and work of Government in modern America are particularly \ndisturbing for someone nominated to the Federal bench, and specifically \nthe D.C. Circuit.\n  Justice Brown has been nominated to what is considered by many to be \nthe second most important court in the nation. The D.C. Circuit is \nunique among the Federal courts of appeals as the court that reviews \ndecisions of the executive branch and the independent agencies. The \nrules and regulations reviewed by this court are felt by average \ncitizens across the Nation every day. These include worker safety rules \nissued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration; the rules \nof the Environmental Protection Agency regarding the purity of the \nwater we drink and the air we breath; workers' right to the minimum \nwage and overtime compensation guaranteed by the Fair Labor Standards \nAct; rights to organize unions and bargain over the terms and \nconditions of employment under the National Labor Relations Act; and \ndecisions by the Federal Trade Commission regarding deceptive or unfair \ntrade practices that injure consumers. The decisions of the D.C. \nCircuit on these and many other subjects have a real and immediate \nimpact on the lives of all Americans.\n  Justice Brown's hostility to the role and work of government in \nmodern America are particularly disturbing for someone nominated to the \nD.C. Circuit. She has repeatedly said that she views government as a \nnegative influence on American life, contrary to the moral fiber of our \nNation. On one occasion, she stated that ``when government moves in, \ncommunity retreats, civil society disintegrates, and our ability to \ncontrol our own destiny atrophies. . . . The result is a debased, \ndebauched culture which finds moral depravity entertaining and virtue \ncontemptible.'' On another occasion, she wrote that ``where government \nadvances . . . freedom is imperiled; community impoverished; religion \nmarginalized and civilization itself jeopardized.'' She has also \nremarked that the New Deal era of the 1930s ``marks the triumph of our \nown socialist revolution.''\n  Her commentary on legal theory is no less extreme.\n  She has railed against what she sees as a judiciary that has \ndistorted and misinterpreted the Constitution. She has stated that \nsince the 1960s, ``we have witnessed the rise of the judge militant.'' \nShe also claims that modern judicial rulings have caused the \nConstitution to be ``demoted to the status of a bad chain novel.'' She \ncontinues to argue in favor of long discredited and overturned legal \ndoctrines which were used to strike down worker protection and social \nwelfare laws over 100 years ago.\n  Other examples of Justice Brown's thinking are equally troubling. She \nhas contended that senior citizens ``cannibalize'' their grandchildren \nby asking for society's support in old age via social security. And \nspeaking recently at a church on ``Justice Sunday,'' Brown proclaimed a \n``war'' between religious people and the rest of America.\n  We have heard nominees that have come before us before argue that \nthey should not be held to their record because it merely reflects \npositions they advanced as advocates for their clients. This defense is \nnot available to Justice Brown. These are opinions that she held solely \non her own behalf, in her own speeches and writings in which she was \nadvancing no one's agenda but her own.\n  Her record on the California Supreme Court does not allay our \nconcerns. She has been consistently unsympathetic\n\n[[Page S6207]]\n\nto the rights of those asserting civil rights or employment \ndiscrimination claims. And, on many occasions, she has been the lone \ndissenter on an already conservative court. She dissented from a case \nwhich upheld a prohibition on an employee's use of hateful racial \ninvective in the workplace; from a decision that held that a city rent \ncontrol ordinance did not constitute an unconstitutional taking of \nprivate property; from allowing workers over age 40 to bring age \ndiscrimination claims; and from a case which found that sexual \nintercourse after a woman told her assailant to stop constituted rape. \nHer frequent dissents are compelling evidence regarding how her \npersonal views affect her judicial decisionmaking.\n  In light of this record, it is not surprising--but nonetheless \ntelling--that both of Justice Brown's home state Senators oppose her \nconfirmation, a virtually unprecedented situation for an appellate \ncourt nominee.\n  An appeals court judge's solemn duty and paramount obligation is to \ndo justice fairly, impartially, and without favor. An appeals court \njudge must be judicious--that is, she must be open minded, must be \nwilling to set his personal preferences aside, and judge without \npredisposition. And, of course, she must follow controlling precedent \nfaithfully, and be able to disregard completely any views she holds to \nthe contrary. In the case of Justice Brown, we are presented with a \nnominee who has a well-documented record, in numerous writings and \nspeeches, of views that are so extreme, and so far outside the \nmainstream, that she fails this basic test.\n  For these reasons, I must continue my opposition to her confirmation \nto this crucial judgeship.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, Socrates said, ``Four things belong to a \njudge: to hear courteously, to answer wisely, to consider soberly, and \nto decide impartially.'' To date, the Senate has confirmed 209 of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees. The vast majority of them received \noverwhelming support from this body. We looked at their records and \ndecided that they had the qualities that Socrates described. Janice \nRogers Brown, however, lacks these qualities and falls far short of \nthis ideal. I sincerely regret that the President has asked this body \nto confirm her to a lifetime appointment to the District of Columbia \nCircuit Court of Appeals.\n  This is no reflection on her individual accomplishments. She comes \nfrom a very humble background, a sharecropper's daughter, and has taken \nfull advantage of all that this country has to offer to become a \nSupreme Court judge. She has gained some wisdom from this experience, I \nam sure, and I have no doubt that she will take her job as a judge \nseriously, soberly.\n  My greatest concern lies with her impartiality. Some of her \nstatements and her decisions on the California Supreme Court lead me to \nbelieve that she will let her personal bias dictate her consideration \nof issues of law. I cannot trust the impartiality of someone who may be \nconsidering issues involving Medicare or Social Security who says that \nsenior citizens ``blithely cannibalize their grandchildren because they \nhave the right to get as much `free' stuff from the political system.'' \nNor can I accept that she will be impartial when she says that age \ndiscrimination ``does not mark its victim with a stigma of \ninferiority.'' Tell that to the 50 year old waitress who loses a job \nbecause she doesn't look ``pretty'' anymore, and ends up getting \nreplaced by a younger, less experienced person.\n  Janice Rogers Brown has been nominated to the Court of Appeals for \nthe District of Columbia Circuit, the court that closely oversees the \nactions of Federal agencies--more than any other Circuit Court. It is \nwidely recognized in the legal community as the second most important \ncourt in the country. Citizens come to the D.C. Circuit to enforce fair \nlabor practice decisions made by the National Labor Relations Board, \nworker safety protection regulations of the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Administration, regulatory decisions made by the Federal \nCommunications Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency, and \nmuch, much more.\n  But Janice Rogers Brown has said that ``where government moves in \ncommunity retreats, civil society disintegrates. . . . The result is: \nfamilies under siege; war in the streets; unapologetic expropriation of \nproperty; the . . . decline of the rule of law . . . a debased, \ndebauched culture which finds moral depravity entertaining. . . . '' \nShe also called the New Deal, which gave us Social Security and the \nTennessee Valley Authority, programs that exist today, ``the triumph of \nour own socialist revolution.'' With sentiments such as these I can \nonly wonder what she thinks of Medicare, Medicaid, child nutrition \nprograms, agricultural subsidies, No Child Left Behind, and a whole \nhost of other programs that give opportunity to our citizens and help \npeople live up to their given potential. To me, these programs are not \nsocialism; they are what a compassionate society does for its people.\n  So I will vote against the confirmation of Janice Rogers Brown. I do \nso knowing that she will likely be confirmed. Her nomination is moving \nforward because she was one of the nominees that 13 of my colleagues \nand I agreed to no longer filibuster. I want to talk about this \nagreement just for a moment.\n  First, I must say that the compromise was essential to avoid a \nserious breakdown in the Senate rules and its functions. It represents \nthe Senate at its best and upholds the traditional constitutional role \nof the Senate as the protector of the rights of minority interests when \nthey were seriously threatened and perhaps irrevocably ended.\n  But more than this, my colleagues and I helped steer a better course \nwith this compromise. A course for jobs, opportunity, better education, \nand future peace. I hope the President will reflect upon the resolve of \nthese 14 Senators to protect and respect the minority and do so by \nsending us nominees who will respect the law and not come exclusively \nfrom the far fringes of the political spectrum.\n  I am open to discussing nominees with the President. I make this \noffer in good faith and in the same spirit as one of his original \ncampaign promises from 2000: to change the culture in Washington. Here \nis what then-Governor Bush said in a speech at that time: ``There is \ntoo much argument in Washington and not enough shared accomplishment. . \n. . As President, I will set a new tone in Washington.

The Senator from Vermont is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, over the course of the Senate's \nconsideration of the nomination of Janice Rogers Brown, we have heard \nmany compelling statements in opposition. Significantly, we have heard \nfrom both Senators from California in opposition. Their opposition, \nlike mine, is based on Justice Brown's record.\n  Through bipartisan action, the Senate has deterred the misguided bid \nby some on the other side of the aisle for one-party rule by means of \ntheir so-called nuclear option. Thanks to the hard work of a bipartisan \ngroup of 14 Senators, we have, for now, preserved the system of checks \nand balances. I mention this because as we vote on the nomination of \nJanice Rogers Brown, I urge all Senators to take seriously the Senate's \nconstitutionally mandated role in determining who is going to serve \nlifetime appointments in the Federal judiciary.\n  I wish all Senators, Republicans and Democrats alike, would take \nthese matters seriously and vote their consciences and evaluate with \nclear eyes the fitness of this woman for this lifetime appointment. \nAfter all, some of my Republican colleagues have admitted to me \nprivately how they would like to vote. They know that Justice Brown is \na consummate judicial activist whose record shows she favors rolling \nback the clock 100 years on workers' and consumer rights and \nconsistently has taken the side of corporations against average \nAmericans.\n  Her record shows she does not believe in clean air and clean water \nprotections for Americans and their communities. She does not believe \nin laws providing affordable housing, and she would, if she could, wipe \nout zoning laws that protect homeowners. Her record shows she takes an \nextremely narrow view of protections against sexual harassment, race \ndiscrimination, employment discrimination, and age discrimination. In \nfact, she has such a hostility toward such programs as Social Security \nthat she has argued that Social Security is unconstitutional. She has \nsaid that ``[t]oday's senior citizens blithely cannibalize their \ngrandchildren . . . ''\n  Why is this important? Because she would be on a court that would \nhandle every one of these issues, and it would mean that as a judicial \nactivist, she would rule entirely different in the cases that court \ndecides.\n  We have heard a lot about her life story. If this were a vote on a \nSenate resolution commemorating her life story, I am sure the entire \nSenate would gladly support it. Instead, this is a vote about the lives \nof multiple millions of other Americans whose lives would be affected \nby this nominee's ideological activist penchants. This is, after all, a \nlifetime appointment on a Federal circuit court on which her ideology \nwould be especially harmful and destructive to the people. That is why \nshe has earned opposition of African-American leaders, law professors, \nand newspapers around the country. In fact, the list of African-\nAmerican organizations and individuals opposing Justice Brown's \nnomination is one of the most troubling indications that this is \nanother divisive, ideologically driven nomination. All 39 members of \nthe Congressional Black Caucus oppose her nomination. The Nation's \noldest and largest association of predominantly African-American \nlawyers and judges, the National Bar Association, and its state \ncounterpart, the California Association of Black Lawyers, both oppose \nthis nomination. The foremost national civil rights organization, the \nLeadership Conference on Civil Rights, opposes it.\n  The women of Delta Sigma Theta oppose this nomination.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters detailing opposition, as well as \na list of such letters, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Letters of Opposition to the Nomination of Janice Rogers Brown to the \n                     D.C.

If appointed, Brown \n     would follow Justice Judith Rogers, a President Clinton \n     appointee, to become the second African American woman judge \n     on the D.C. Circuit Court. Many people consider this \n     appointment as preliminary grooming for a future nomination \n     to the U.S. Supreme Court. This consideration is not without \n     merit: Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Ruth \n     Ginsberg all previously served on the prestigious D.C. \n     Circuit Court.\n       The National Bar Association must consider, among other \n     things, whether a judicial nominee will be a responsible \n     voice upon which all people, particularly people in the \n     traditionally underserved communities, for instance African \n     Americans, other ethnic minorities and women, can depend when \n     fundamental legal issues of race, ethnicity, or gender may \n     profoundly impact the designated population in the areas of \n     advancement in business, education, civil rights, and the \n     judicial arenas arise.\n       A rigorous review of several of Justice Brown's opinions in \n     the California Supreme Court undertaken by the California \n     Association of Black Lawyers (copy attached), an affiliate of \n     the National Bar Association, indicates a most disturbing \n     view and what may be in store for minorities under her \n     stewardship on the bench. In for instance Hi-Voltage Wire \n     Works, Inc. v. City of San Jose, 24 Cal 4th 537 (2000), \n     Justice Brown wrote the majority opinion striking down a San \n     Jose ordinance that required the City of San Jose to solicit \n     bids from companies owned by minority and women \n     subcontractors. She reasoned that the plan to seek minority \n     subcontractors violated Proposition 209, which is the 1996 \n     voter-adopted state constitutional amendment that banned \n     racial preferences. She further concluded that instead of \n     affirmative action, ``equality of individual opportunity is \n     what the constitution demands.''\n       In view thereof, the National Bar Association strongly \n     urges and recommends that the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     reject the nomination of Justice Janice Rogers Brown to the \n     U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Clyde E. Bailey, Sr.,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         California Association of\n\n\n                                                Black Lawyers,\n\n                                Mill Valley, CA, October 17, 2003.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Hatch and Leahy: On behalf of the California \n     Association of Black Lawyers (``CABL''), I write to express \n     our strong opposition to the nomination of Janice Rogers \n     Brown to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.\n       CABL is the only statewide organization of African American \n     lawyers, judges, professors and law students in the State of \n     California. We are an affiliate of the National Bar \n     Association (the ``NBA'') and we join the National Bar \n     Association in its opposition to Justice Brown. (The NBA \n     recently forwarded CABL's Official Position Paper opposing \n     Justice Brown's nomination to you. I am enclosing a copy, for \n     your easy reference.)\n       As California lawyers, we are familiar with Justice Brown \n     and her record on the California Supreme Court. We are deeply \n     concerned about her extremist judicial philosophy, that she \n     has manifested in numerous opinions over the years. It is \n     clear to us that she misuses precedent and challenges \n     precedent, in order to achieve the result she desires. A \n     prime example is her opinion in Hi-Voltage Wire Works, Inc. \n     v. City of San Jose, the California's Supreme Court's first \n     application of Proposition 209. According to Chief Justice \n     Ronald George, who refused to join her opinion, Justice Brown \n     seriously distorted the history of civil rights jurisprudence \n     and concluded outright that the U.S. Supreme Court decisions \n     supporting affirmative action were wrongly decided.\n       California has strong civil rights statutes, and many of us \n     litigate pursuant to these statutes. Yet Justice Brown has \n     repeatedly deviated from precedent in order to narrowly \n     interpret these statutes and render them virtually \n     inaccessible to victims of discrimination.\n       We urge you to undertake an extremely careful review of \n     Justice Brown and her record. We hope that you will conclude, \n     as we have done, that she is simply not within the mainstream \n     of legal thought. She is therefore not suited for appointment \n     to the second most important court in our nation, the D.C. \n     Circuit.\n           Respectfully yours,\n                                               Gillian G.M. Small,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, and, of course, both the Senators from her \nhome State have opposed her. In fact, if she is confirmed, this may be \nthe first such Senate confirmation over the opposition of both home \nState Senators in the history of the Senate, something, I might say, \nthat during President Clinton's time was inconceivable-that Republicans \nwould even consider a nomination if one Senator from the home State \nopposed the nominee and, of course, under no circumstances both. Here \nboth Senators do oppose her, and yet her nomination is going forward.\n  There remain 36 Republican Senators serving today who voted against \nthe nomination of Justice Ronnie White of Missouri in 1999. Justice \nWhite is now the chief justice of the Missouri Supreme Court, having \nbeen that high court's first African-American member. Former Senator \nAshcroft came to the floor and vilified Justice White as pro criminal \nin 1999, after action on that nomination had been delayed more than 2 \nyears. Then, in a surprise party-line vote, Republican Senators all \nvoted against his confirmation. In fact, that is the only party-line \nvote to defeat a judicial nomination that I can remember in my 31 years \nhere.\n  Immediately after this party-line vote, by which Republican Senators \ndefeated the nomination of Justice Ronnie White, many of them told us: \nWe know he is qualified, but we had no choice because both home State \nSenators opposed the nomination. In order to respect the views of these \nhome State Senators, they had to vote against a nominee who many felt \nwas highly qualified.\n  Both Justice Brown's home State Senators oppose her confirmation. \nThey have been consistent in that opposition. Republican Senators felt \ncompelled to vote against Justice White, a nominee of President \nClinton, in 1999 because of the opposition of his home State Senators. \nIt is hard to see how they can now turn around and say: Well, but we \ncan vote for a Republican nominee notwithstanding the same kind of \nopposition.\n  It is not just the two distinguished Senators from California who \noppose her. Her views are so extreme that more than 200 law school \nprofessors around the Nation wrote to the Judiciary Committee \nexpressing opposition.\n  The ``Los Angeles Times'' concludes she is a ``bad fit for a key \ncourt.'' The ``Detroit Free Press'' concluded she ``has all but hung a \nbanner above her head declaring herself a foe to privacy rights, civil \nrights, legal precedent, and even colleagues who don't share her \nextreme leanings.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that these editorials, as well as a list of \nother editorials opposing the Brown nomination, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S6210]]\n\nPublished Opposition to the Nomination of Janice Rogers Brown, Nominee \n                  to the D.C.

So did onetime Chief Justices Warren Burger and Fred \n     Vinson, among others.\n       Presidents also give special attention to the D.C. court's \n     appointments because it often hears high-profile challenges \n     to presidential and congressional actions, defining the \n     government's authority. This year the D.C. Circuit Court \n     upheld the indefinite detention of potential terrorists at \n     Guantanamo, Cuba. In past years, it expanded police search \n     and seizure powers and upheld the 1971 campaign spending law \n     and environmental and workplace safety Laws. Before it now is \n     a challenge by California and other states to the \n     administration's view that the Clean Air Act does not allow \n     regulation of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.\n       That President Bush may view California Supreme Court \n     Justice Janice Rogers Brown as a future U.S. Supreme Court \n     justice could explain why he nominated her to the D.C. court, \n     3,000 miles from her San Francisco base. But during her seven \n     years on California's high court, Brown has shown doctrinaire \n     and peculiar views that make her a troubling choice for this \n     appeals court.\n       Judges are supposed to consider disputes with an open mind, \n     weighing facts against the law and precedent. Conscientious \n     judges sometimes find that their decisions conflict with \n     their personal beliefs. However, in opinions and speeches, \n     Brown has articulated disdainful views of the Constitution \n     and government that are so strong and so far from the \n     mainstream as to raise questions about whether they would \n     control her decisions.\n       `Where government advances,' she told a college audience, \n     `freedom is imperiled, community impoverished, religion \n     marginalized and civilization itself jeopardized'--a \n     startling view for someone who would be charged with \n     reviewing government actions. Brown has spoken disapprovingly \n     of what she called the U.S. Supreme Court's `hypervigilance' \n     with respect to such `judicially proclaimed fundamental \n     rights' as privacy, calling them `highly suspect, incoherent \n     and constitutionally invalid.'\n       These views may have prompted Brown's bitter dissents in \n     cases in which her colleagues upheld regulatory actions such \n     as local zoning and land-use laws. They seem to have fueled \n     her skepticism toward employment discrimination claims, cases \n     involving the rights of people with disabilities and the \n     meaning of consent in rape.\n       Brown's dogmatism and a style bordering on vituperation \n     earned her only a `qualified' rather than `well qualified' \n     rating from the American Bar Assn. Some committee members \n     found her unfit for the appeals court.\n       The Senate Judiciary Committee could vote on Brown's \n     nomination Thursday. There's little question that Brown is an \n     intellectually sharp and hard-working jurist, but that is not \n     enough. Her own words are unrelentingly hostile to \n     government's role in regulatory matters and protection of \n     individual rights. These are the very things on which she \n     would rule most often. Brown is a bad fit for the District of \n     Columbia appeals court.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 Judicial Pick Not Fit for U.S. Court,\n\n       [From the Atlanta Journal and Constitution, Oct. 29, 2003]\n\n       President Bush has once again nominated a right-wing judge \n     for one of the nation's most influential appellate courts. \n     Worse yet, Janice Rogers Brown, a California Supreme Court \n     justice, is not qualified for the U.S. Court of Appeals for \n     the D.C. Circuit.\n       Despite Bush's penchant for politics over professional \n     qualifications in judicial appointments, Democrats are not \n     blameless in the current standoff. They filibustered the \n     nomination of Hispanic conservative Miguel Estrada for the \n     same appellate court vacancy. Estrada, who finally withdrew \n     from consideration, had unquestioned scholarly and legal \n     qualifications for a federal judgeship.\n       Rather than select another highly qualified conservative \n     for the key appellate bench, the president took the low road, \n     choosing a judge who previously received an `unqualified' \n     rating from the California bar's evaluation commission and \n     last month got a mixed rating of `qualified/unqualified' from \n     the American Bar Association. By contrast, Estrada received a \n     unanimous ABA rating of `well qualified.'\n       Brown's views, as espoused in speeches to ultraconservative \n     groups, are far out of the mainstream of accepted legal \n     principles. For example, she has disputed whether the Bill of \n     Rights, as incorporated in the U.S. Constitution, should have \n     been applied to the states.\n       While the African-American jurist claims her tendency to \n     `stir the pot' wouldn't affect her rulings, such a radical \n     view causes the public to wonder if she will respect basic \n     individual liberties guaranteed in the Bill of Rights.\n       Brown meets the GOP's litmus test of being anti-affirmative \n     action and anti-abortion, but that is a sorry measure of \n     judicial excellence. Bush knows that Brown will fall victim \n     to a Democratic filibuster. Apparently, this president would \n     rather have a campaign issue than a qualified federal \n     judiciary.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 25, 2003]\n\n                      Out of the Mainstream, Again\n\n       Of the many unworthy judicial nominees President Bush has \n     put forward, Janice Rogers Brown is among the very worst. As \n     an archconservative justice on the California Supreme Court, \n     she has declared war on the mainstream legal values that most \n     Americans hold dear. And she has let ideology be her guide in \n     deciding cases. At her confirmation hearing this week, \n     Justice Brown only ratified her critics' worst fears. Both \n     Republican and Democratic senators should oppose her \n     confirmation.\n\n[[Page S6211]]\n\n       Justice Brown, who has been nominated to the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, has \n     made it clear in her public pronouncements how extreme her \n     views are. She has attacked the New Deal, which gave us \n     Social Security and other programs now central to American \n     life, as ``the triumph of our socialist revolution.'' And she \n     has praised the infamous Lochner line of cases, in which the \n     Supreme Court, from 1905 to 1937, struck down worker health \n     and safety laws as infringing on the rights of business.\n       Justice Brown's record as a judge is also cause for alarm. \n     She regularly stakes out extreme positions, often dissenting \n     alone. In one case, her court ordered a rental car company to \n     stop its supervisor from calling Hispanic employees by racial \n     epithets. Justice Brown dissented, arguing that doing so \n     violated the company's free speech rights.\n       Last year, her court upheld a $10,000 award for emotional \n     distress to a black woman who had been refused an apartment \n     because of her race. Justice Brown, the sole dissenter, \n     argued that the agency involved had no power to award the \n     damages.\n       In an important civil rights case, the chief justice of her \n     court criticized Justice Brown for ``presenting an unfair and \n     inaccurate caricature'' of affirmative action. The American \n     Bar Association, all but a rubber stamp for the \n     administration's nominees, has given Justice Brown a mediocre \n     rating of qualified/not qualified, which means a majority of \n     the evaluation committee found her qualified, a minority \n     found her not qualified, and no one found her well qualified.\n       The Bush administration has packaged Justice Brown, an \n     African-American born in segregated Alabama, as an American \n     success story. The 39-member Congressional Black Caucus, \n     however, has come out against her confirmation.\n       President Bush, who promised as a candidate to be a \n     ``uniter, not a divider,'' has selected the most divisive \n     judicial nominees in modern times. The Senate should help the \n     president keep his campaign promise by insisting on a more \n     unifying alternative than Justice Brown.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have voted to confirm hundreds of \nnominees with whom I differ. I vote for them when I think they will be \nfair and impartial. I voted for hundreds of President Bush's nominees, \nas I did his father, President Reagan, and President Ford, all \nPresidents with whom I have been proud to serve. But I voted against \nthose, whether Republican or Democratic nominees, if I disagreed with \nthem, if I felt they could not be impartial.\n  I believe Judge Brown has proven herself to be a results-oriented, \nagenda-driven judge whose respect for precedent and rules of judicial \ninterpretation change depending upon the subject before her and the \nresults she wants to reach. She is the definition of an activist judge, \nthe sort of person President Bush said he would not nominate.\n  Whether it is protection of the elderly, workers and consumers, \nprivacy rights, free speech, civil liberties, and many more issues, she \nhas inserted her radical views into her judicial opinions time and \nagain.\n  She repeatedly and consistently has advocated turning back the clock \n100 years to return to an era where worker protection laws were found \nunconstitutional.\n  It is no small irony this President, who spoke of being a uniter, has \nused his position to renominate Justice Brown and others after they \nfailed to get consent of the Senate.\n  These provocative nominees have divided the Senate and the American \npeople, and they brought us to the edge of a nuclear winter in the \nSenate.\n  This confrontational approach and divisiveness have continued, \ndespite the confirmation of 209 out of his 218 jurdicial nominees.\n  I oppose giving Justice Brown this lifetime promotion to the second \nhighest court in our land because the American people deserve judges \nwho will interpret the law fairly and objectively. Janice Rogers Brown \nis a committed judicial activist who has a record of using her position \nas a member of a court to put her views above the law and above the \ninterests of working men and women and families across the Nation.\n  We must not enable her to bring her ``jurisprudence of convenience'' \nto one of the most important Federal courts in the Nation.\n  Over the course of the Senate's consideration of the nomination of \nJanice Rogers Brown to be a judge on the United States Court of Appeals \nfor the D.C. Circuit, I have publicly explained why I cannot support \nit. My opposition is based on Justice Brown's extensive record, which \nraises unavoidable concerns about her pursuit from the bench of her \nextremist judicial philosophy and therefore about her fitness for this \nlifetime appointment. Justice Brown failed to gain the consent of the \nSenate last year. As I explained in April when voting against her \nconfirmation in the Senate Judiciary Committee, not only has Justice \nBrown failed to resolve any of my concerns since her hearing in late \n2003, but Justice Brown's opinions issued since that time reinforce and \ndeepen the troubling patterns in her record.\n  Through bipartisan action, the Senate has deterred the misguided bid \nby some on the other side of the aisle for one-party rule by means of \ntheir nuclear option. Thanks to the hard work of a bipartisan group of \n14 Senators, we have, for now, preserved the system of checks and \nbalances, designed by the Founders, that are so integral to the \nfunction of the Senate and to its role. As we turn now to the \nnomination of Janice Rogers Brown, I urge all Senators to take \nseriously the Senate's constitutionally mandated role as a partner with \nthe executive branch in determining who will serve lifetime \nappointments in the federal judiciary. I urge all Senators, Republicans \nand Democrats alike, to take these matters seriously and vote their \nconsciences. Republican Senators and Democratic Senators alike will \nneed to evaluate, with clear eyes, the fitness of Justice Brown for \nthis lifetime judicial appointment before casting a difficult vote on \nthis problematic and highly controversial nominee. My opposition to \nJustice Brown's nomination is based, as it has always been, on her \nrecord.\n  Justice Brown is a consummate judicial activist whose record shows \nthat she favors rolling back the clock 100 years on workers' and \nconsumers' rights and taking the side of corporations against average \nAmericans. Her record shows she does not believe in clean air and clean \nwater protections for Americans and their communities, she does not \nbelieve in laws providing affordable housing, and that she would, if \nshe could, wipe out zoning laws that protect homeowners by keeping porn \nshops and factories from moving in next door. Her record shows she \ntakes an extremely narrow view of protections against sexual \nharassment, race discrimination, employment discrimination, and, most \nof all, age discrimination. In fact, Justice Brown has a hostility \ntoward such programs as Social Security that is so great that she has \nargued that Social Security is unconstitutional, and has said that \n``[t]oday's senior citizens blithely cannibalize their grandchildren. . \n. .''\n  We have heard a great deal from Justice Brown's supporters about her \nlife accomplishments. It is an impressive story, and Justice Brown's \naccomplishments in the face of so much adversity are commendable. But \nwe cannot base our votes on the confirmation of a lifetime appointee to \na Federal court on biography alone. If this were a vote on a Senate \nresolution commemorating her life story, I am sure the entire Senate \nwould gladly support it. But instead, this is a vote about the lives of \nmultiple millions of other Americans whose lives would be affected by \nthis nominee's ideological penchants.\n  I hope that, as debate Justice Brown's nomination, we will not--as we \ndid 2\\1/2\\ years ago--hear the whispering of unfounded smears against \nthose who oppose this nomination. I have spoken recently about my \ndisappointment in the White House and Republican partisans for fanning \nthe flames of bigotry and refusing to tamp down unfounded claims that \namount to religious McCarthyism. I urged the White House, Republican \nleaders, and moderate Republicans to join me in condemning the \ninjection of such smears into the consideration of nominations. The \nfailure to do so risks subverting this constitutional process and the \nindependence of our federal courts.\n  The unfounded charges of bigotry are belied by the numbers of major \nAfrican-American leaders, newspapers and law professors across the \ncountry who also oppose this nomination based on Justice Brown's record \nof extremism. The list of the African-American organizations and \nindividuals who oppose Justice Brown's nomination is a clear indication \nthat this is another divisive, ideologically driven nomination. The 39 \nmembers of the Congressional Black Caucus oppose Justice Brown's \nnomination, including the respected congressional delegate from the \nDistrict of\n\n[[Page S6212]]\n\nColumbia, Eleanor Holmes Norton, and Representatives Charles Rangel, \nElijah Cummings and John Conyers, and the chair of the Congressional \nBlack Caucus, Representative Mel Watt. The nation's oldest and largest \nassociation of predominantly African-American lawyers and judges--the \nNational Bar Association--and its State counterpart--the California \nAssociation of Black Lawyers--both oppose this nomination. The foremost \nnational civil rights organization, the Leadership Conference on Civil \nRights, opposes this nomination. The women of Delta Sigma Theta oppose \nthis nomination. Dr. Dorothy Height, Dr. Joseph Lowery and Julian Bond, \nhistoric leaders in the fight for equal rights, have spoken out against \nthis nomination.\n  The baseless smears that we have heard are irresponsible, harmful and \ndemonstrably false. Democrats have voted to confirm each of the other \n15 African-American judges nominated by President Bush and brought to \nthe Senate for a vote, including all four of the other African-\nAmericans confirmed to appellate courts. Democrats have fought hard to \nintegrate the Fourth Circuit, working with Senator Warner through the \nconfirmation of Judge Roger Gregory, and with Senator Edwards on the \nconfirmation of Judge Allyson Duncan. And it was Democratic Members who \nwere outraged at the Republicans' partyline vote against Justice Ronnie \nWhite and Republican pocket filibusters of Judge Beatty, Judge Wynn, \nKathleen McCree Lewis, and so many outstanding African-Americans judges \nand lawyers blocked during the Clinton years.\n  Let us not see that shameful card dealt from the deck of unfounded \ncharges that some stalwarts of this President's most extreme nominees \nhave come more and more to rely upon. Let us stick to the merits. As so \nmany have explained in such detail over the last few days, those who \noppose her do so because they retain serious doubts about her \nnomination and see her as an ideologue or a judicial activist.\n\n  The basis for my opposition is the extremism of Justice Brown's \nrecord. That, too, is the reason both of her home State Senators oppose \nher. As we have heard in the Judiciary Committee and here on the Senate \nFloor, both Senators from California, who arguably know this nominee \nand her record better than most, strongly oppose Justice Brown's \nconfirmation. There was a time in the Senate, not that long ago, when \nopposition by a nominee's home State Senators, no matter how late in \nthe day it was announced, was enough to halt a nomination. I remember \nhow that tradition was adhered to scrupulously by Republican Senators \n5\\1/2\\ years ago when the Senate voted on the confirmation of Ronnie \nWhite to be a judge in Missouri. Even though one of his home State \nSenators had warmly endorsed him at his hearing, an eleventh hour \nreversal by that Senator led to every Republican Senator voting against \nJustice White. Thirty-six of those Senators are still serving in the \nSenate today, and if the approval of a nominee's home State Senator is \nas important today as it was in 1999, then the Senate will reject this \nnomination. The former Chairman of the Judiciary Committee came to the \nSenate after the defeat of Justice White's nomination to explain \nexplicitly the importance of home State opposition in that \nunprecedented party-line vote.\n  As I have detailed, Justice Brown's home State Senators are not the \nonly ones who oppose her. Her views, both in speeches and in opinions \nissued from the bench, are so extreme that more than 200 law school \nprofessors from around the country wrote to the Committee, prior to her \nhearing, expressing their opposition.\n  The Senate is faced with several extreme nominees who have clear \nrecords of trying to rewrite the law from the bench. In Justice Brown's \nhearing before the Committee, then-Chairman Hatch began the hearing by \nreferring to President Bush's description of his judicial nomination \nstandard: ``Every judge I appoint will be a person who clearly \nunderstands the role of the judge is to interpret the law, not to \nlegislate from the bench. My judicial nominees will know the \ndifference.'' Regretfully, Justice Brown, a practitioner of a results-\noriented brand of judicial activism so radical she is frequently the \nlone dissenter from a 6-1 Republican majority court, represents the \nantithesis of the President's purported standard. In re-nominating \nJustice Brown after she failed to gain consent of the Senate, the \nPresident has, again, selected a judicial nominee who deeply divides \nthe American people and the Senate.\n  After Justice Brown's record was examined in the hearing on her \nnomination, editorial pages across the country came to the same \nconclusion. Justice Brown's home State newspaper, The Los Angeles \nTimes, concluded she is a ``bad fit for a key court,'' after finding \nthat ``in opinions and speeches, Brown has articulated disdainful views \nof the Constitution and government that are so strong and so far from \nthe mainstream as to raise questions about whether they would control \nher decisions.'' The Detroit Free Press concluded: ``Brown has all but \nhung a banner above her head declaring herself a foe to privacy rights, \ncivil rights, legal precedent and even colleagues who don't share her \nextremist leanings.'' The Atlanta Journal and Constitution concluded \nthat Janice Rogers Brown is ``not qualified for the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the D.C. Circuit.'' The Washington Post found that Justice \nBrown is ``one of the most unapologetically ideological nominees of \neither party in many years.'' And The New York Times concluded that, \nbased on Justice Brown's record as a judge, she has ``let ideology be \nher guide in deciding cases.'' I would ask that these editorials \nexpressing opposition, as well as a list of all of the editorials \nopposing the Brown nomination be entered in the Record.\n  Justice Brown has a lengthy record of opinions, of speeches and of \nwritings. She has very strong opinions, and there is little mystery \nabout her views, even though she sought to moderate them when she \nappeared before the Judiciary Committee. I come to my decision, after \nreviewing Justice Brown's record--her judicial opinions, her speeches \nand writings--and considering her testimony and oral and written \nanswers provided to the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  My opposition is not about whether Justice Brown would vote like me \nif she were a member of the United States Senate. I have voted to \nconfirm probably hundreds of nominees with whom I differ. Nor is this \nabout one dissent or one speech. This is about Justice Brown's approach \nto the law, an approach which she has consistently used to promote her \nown ideological agenda that is out of the mainstream. Her hostility \nboth to Supreme Court precedent and to the intent of the legislature \ndoes not entitle her to a lifetime appointment to this highly important \nappellate court.\n  As I have said--and as remains true today--Janice Rogers Brown's \napproach to the law can be best described as a ``jurisprudence of \nconvenience.'' Justice Brown has proven herself to be a results-\noriented, agenda-driven judge whose respect for precedent and rules of \njudicial interpretation change and shift depending on the subject \nmatter before her and the results she wants to reach.\n  Hers is a record of sharp-elbowed ideological activism.\n  While Justice Brown's approach to the law has been inconsistent--she \nhas taken whatever approach she needs to in order to get to a result \nshe desires--the results which she has worked toward have been very \nconsistent, throughout her public record. At her hearing, Justice Brown \nattempted to separate her speeches from her role as a judge. However, \non issue after issue--the protection of the elderly, workers and \nconsumers; equal protection; the takings clause; privacy rights; free \nspeech; civil liberties; remedies; the use of peremptory challenges, \nand many more--Justice Brown has inserted her radical views into her \njudicial opinions time and time again. In fact, Justice Brown's \ncomments to groups across the country over the last 10 years repeated \nthe same themes--sometimes even the same words--as she has written in \nher bench opinions.\n  In Santa Monica Beach v. Superior Court of L.A. County, Justice Brown \nwrote of the demise of the Lochner era, claiming ``the `revolution of \n1937' ended the era of economic substantive due process but it did not \ndampen the court's penchant for rewriting the Constitution.'' \nSimilarly, in a speech to the Federalist Society, she said of the year \n1937: it ``marks the triumph of our own socialist revolution.''\n\n[[Page S6213]]\n\n  In San Remo Hotel v. City and County of San Francisco, Justice Brown \nwrote, ``[t]urning a democracy into a kleptocracy does not enhance the \nstature of the thieves; it only diminishes the legitimacy of the \ngovernment.'' Similarly, two years earlier, she told an audience at the \nInstitute for Justice: ``If we can invoke no ultimate limits on the \npower of government, a democracy is inevitably transformed into a \nkleptocracy--a license to steal, a warrant for oppression.''\n  As Berkeley Law School Professor Stephen Barnett pointed out about \nJustice Brown's ``apparent claim that these are `just speeches' that \nexist in an entirely different world from her judicial opinions,'' \n``that defense not only is implausible but trivializes the judicial \nrole.'' I agree with Professor Barnett on this and understand his \ndetermination to oppose her nomination. Justice Brown's provocative \nspeeches are disturbing in their own right, and they are made more so \nby their reprise in her opinions.\n  During her hearing, Justice Brown told the Committee that she will \n``follow the law.'' However, her opinions from the bench speak much \nlouder than her words to the Committee. In such a judicial dissent she \nwrote, ``We cannot simply cloak ourselves in the doctrine of stare \ndecisis.''\n  Justice Brown's disregard for precedent in her opinions in order to \nexpand the rights of corporations and wealthy property owners, at the \nexpense of workers and individuals who have been the victims of \ndiscrimination, stands among the clearest illustrations of Justice \nBrown's results-oriented jurisprudence. In several dissents, Justice \nBrown called for overturning an exception to at-will employment that \nhas been long recognized by the California Supreme Court, and was \ncreated to protect workers from discrimination. She has repeatedly \nargued for overturning precedent to provide more leeway for \ncorporations against attempts to stop the sale of cigarettes to minors, \nprevent consumer fraud, and prevent the exclusion of women and \nhomosexuals.\n  Justice Brown has also been inconsistent in the application of rules \nof judicial interpretation--again depending on the result that she \nwants to reach in order to fulfill her extremist ideological agenda.\n  These legal trends--her disregard for precedent, her inconsistency in \njudicial interpretation, and her tendency to inject her personal \nopinions into her judicial opinions--lead to no other conclusion but \nthat Janice Rogers Brown is--in the true sense of the words--a judicial \nactivist.\n  When it is needed to reach a conclusion that meets her own \nideological beliefs, Justice Brown stresses the need for deference to \nthe legislature and the electorate. However, when the laws--as passed \nby legislators and voters--are different than laws she believes are \nnecessary, she has shown no deference, presses her own agenda and \nadvocates for judicial activism.\n  One stark example comes in an opinion she wrote where in order to \nsupport her view that judges should be able to limit damages in \nemployment discrimination cases, she concluded that ``creativity'' was \na permissible judicial practice and that all judges ``make law.''\n  Justice Brown's approach to the law has led to many opinions which \nare highly troubling. She repeatedly and consistently has advocated \nturning back the clock 100 years to return to an era where worker \nprotection laws were found unconstitutional. She has attacked the New \nDeal, an era which created Social Security, fair labor standards and \nchild labor laws, by calling it ``fundamentally incompatible with the \nvision that undergirded this country's founding.'' Justice Brown's \nantipathy to the New Deal and Social Security is so strong, that she \nstated, in Santa Monica Beach v. Superior Court of L.A. County, 19 Cal. \n4th 952 (1999), that ``1937 [the year in which much of President \nRoosevelt's New Deal legislation took effect] . . . marks the triumph \nof our own socialist revolution . . .''\n  Justice Brown's hostility toward Social Security is part of larger \nhostility toward the needs and the rights of senior citizens. In a 2000 \nspeech to a right-wing group, Justice Brown claimed that, ``Today's \nsenior citizens blithely cannibalize their grandchildren because they \nhave a right to get as much `free' stuff as the political system will \npermit them to extract.'' Justice Brown has injected this hostility \ninto her opinions. In Stevenson v. Superior Court of Los Angeles \nCounty, 16 Cal. 4th 880 (1997), Justice Brown was the only member of \nthe court to find that age discrimination victims cannot sue under \ncommon law because, as she stated in that case, she does not believe \nage discrimination stigmatizes senior citizens.\n  And she has repeatedly opposed protections against discrimination of \nindividuals--in their jobs and in their homes. Justice Brown's claims \nthat her words do not mean what they say are simply unconvincing.\n  Another troubling aspect of Justice Brown's nomination is the court \nfor which she has been nominated. She is being considered for a \nposition on the premier administrative law court in the nation--a court \nthat is charged with overseeing the actions of federal agencies that \nare responsible for worker protections, environmental standards, \nconsumer safeguards, and civil rights protections.\n  I am concerned about her ability to be a fair arbitrator on this \ncourt. Justice Brown has made no secret of her disdain for government's \nrole in upholding protections against the abuse of the powerless, those \nwho struggle in our society, and our environment. She has said, ``. . . \nwhere government moves in, community retreats, civil society \ndisintegrates, and our ability to control our own destiny atrophies.''\n  How can someone who has demonstrated her activism be entrusted to \nmake fair and neutral decisions when faced with the responsibility of \ninterpreting the powers of the federal government and the breadth of \nregulatory statutes? Justice Brown responded to this question at her \nhearing by calling on us to review her record as a judge to see that \nshe does not ``hate government.'' Well, I did review her record. And, \nwhat I found was disturbing: She has used her position on and off the \nbench to argue for the dismantling of government from the inside out.\n  Since the Senate last considered Justice Brown's nomination, her \ntroubling jurisprudence has not changed. As demonstrated by her recent \nopinions, Justice Brown has continued to be a results-oriented judge \nwith little consistency in judicial interpretation who gives great \ndeference to her own agenda rather than to precedent, to the intent of \nthe legislature, or to the Constitution.\n  In the last 18 months, since Justice Brown appeared before the \nJudiciary Committee:\n  She has expressly ignored Supreme Court precedent in seeking judicial \nrepeal of a State antidiscrimination statute giving drug benefits to \nwomen, despite her own finding that the statute met the Supreme Court's \ntest.\n  She has denigrated the constitutional right to privacy and bodily \nintegrity as mere ``sympathy'' by the majority.\n  She has shown deference to the intent of employers rather than to \nprecedent, to the detriment of the retirement benefits of long-term \nworkers.\n  She has sought to replace the legislature's judgment regarding the \nvalue of expert testimony related to ``Battered Women's Syndrome'' with \nher own judgment that domestic violence is ``simply a label, now \ncodified,'' which would make it more difficult to prosecute domestic \nviolence.\n  She has sought to overturn a long line of precedent that African-\nAmerican women are considered a ``cognizable group'' for the purpose of \nassessing where a prosecuting attorney has violated equal protection in \nthe use of peremptory challenges.\n  She has demonstrated her hostility to common law by overturning \nCalifornia's century-old second-degree felony murder rule.\n  She has sought to make it more difficult for a worker to pursue a \nsexual harassment claim against her employer by strictly enforcing \nrelease language in a separate worker's compensation settlement, even \nthough this result would, according to the majority, ``create a trap \nfor the unwary worker.''\n  Justice Brown's record since her hearing--and since she was last \nrejected by the Senate--has only brought into sharper focus the \nradicalism of her opinions and only deepened my concern about her \nextremism.\n  Indeed, in the last several days the United States Supreme Court \ndecision\n\n[[Page S6214]]\n\nin a regulatory takings case demonstrates anew just how far out of the \nmainstream she is. In this case, a strong majority of the Supreme Court \nrejected the approach that Justice Brown has endorsed in her efforts to \nexpand the takings clause of the Constitution to thwart local \ngovernment regulation for health, safety, controlled growth and \neconomic development.\n  America would look like and be a very different place if Justice \nBrown had her way. She would do away with many of the core protections \nAmericans count on to keep their jobs and communities safe and their \nretirements secure. There would be few if any laws protecting Americans \nfrom race discrimination, employment discrimination or age \ndiscrimination, or protecting a woman's right to choose. Corporate \nspeech would be protected, but not the first amendment rights of \nemployees to criticize an employer's practices. Corporations would be \nprotected against suits for stock fraud and for illegally selling \ncigarettes to minors, but private employers would not be required to \nprovide contraceptive drug benefits for women.\n  Justice Brown's America would mean a return to the widely and \njustifiably discredited Lochner era, an era named after a Supreme Court \ndecision so widely-derided that even Robert Bork called its judicial \nactivism an ``abomination.'' A return to the Lochner era would mean a \nreturn to a time without protections against child labor. It would mean \na return to a time without zoning protections to prevent porn shops and \nfactories and rat-infested slaughterhouses from moving in next door to \nAmericans' homes; a time without consumer protection and laws providing \nfor affordable housing; a time without worker safety laws and without \nfair labor standards; and a time without laws protecting clean air and \nclean water. And it would mean a return to a time without Social \nSecurity.\n  It is no small irony that this President, who spoke of being a \nuniter, has used his position to re-nominate Justice Brown and others \nafter they failed to gain consent of the Senate. These provocative \nnominees have divided the Senate and the American people and brought \nthe Senate to the edge of a ``nuclear winter.'' His divisiveness has \ncontinued, despite the confirmation of 209 out of his 218 judicial \nnominees. It is no small irony that this President, who spoke with \ndisdain of ``judicial activism,'' has nominated several of the most \nconsummate judicial activists ever chosen by any President. None of the \nPresident's nominees is more in the mold of a judicial activist than \nthis nominee.\n  I oppose giving Justice Brown this lifetime promotion to the second \nhighest court in our land because the American people deserve judges \nwho will interpret the law fairly and objectively. Janice Rogers Brown \nis a committed judicial activist who has a consistent record of using \nher position as a member of the court to put her views above the law \nand above the interests of working men and women and families across \nthe Nation. We should not enable her to bring her ``jurisprudence of \nconvenience'' to one of the most important Federal courts in the \nNation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania controls the \nnext 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as the debate winds down on the \nnomination of California State Supreme Court Justice Janice Rogers \nBrown, I suggest to my colleagues that this debate is really not about \nJustice Brown at all, but it is about the escalating battle which has \nbeen going on between the two parties since the last 2 years of \nPresident Reagan's administration and continuing up to the present \ntime.\n  I was on the Judiciary Committee in the last 2 years of the Reagan \nadministration, having served since I was elected in 1980 on that \ncommittee, and there was a limited list to be confirmed after the \nDemocrats took control of the Senate in the 1986 election, for 1987 and \n1988.\n  Then the policy was continued during the 4 years of President George \nHerbert Walker Bush. I recall pending Third Circuit nominees who were \nnot going to be considered because we were not going to confirm any \nmore of the President's nominees.\n  Then the situation was exacerbated to a new level during the years of \nPresident Clinton, when some 60 judges were bottled up. I opposed that \npractice at the time as a Republican on the Judiciary Committee and \nsupported Judge Berzon, Judge Paez, and others, and urged that we not \nhave party payback.\n  Then the matter was exacerbated to new levels with the unprecedented \nuse of systematic filibusters, the first time in the history of the \ncountry that has been done.\n  Then the President responded with an interim appointment, the first \ninterim appointment in the history of the Senate on a Senate rejection, \nalbeit by the filibuster route.\n  Then we came to the critical issue of how we were going to handle the \nfuture with the heavy debate on the so-called constitutional or nuclear \noption. And finally, we worked our way through on individual judges, \nwithout reviewing all of that history.\n  What this nomination is all about is party payback time. That is what \nit is. In the 25 years I have been on the Judiciary Committee, I have \nseen the committee routinely confirm circuit judges who were no better \nqualified and, in many cases, not as well qualified as Justice Brown.\n  We had two very celebrated cases where two nominees for circuit court \nwent through with relative ease, and then their records were subjected \nto very intense scrutiny during nomination hearings for the Supreme \nCourt of the United States. But the practice has been to confirm the \ncircuit judges.\n  The argument is made that circuit judges play a critical role, and \nwill make law because their cases will not be reviewed by the U.S. \nSupreme Court, which grants certiorari in so few cases. But the fact is \nthat no one judge can do that on the circuit. The judges sit in panels \nof three. So if one judge is way out of line, does something egregious, \nthere has to be a second judge concurring. And if there is concurrence \non something that is out of line, the circuit courts have the court en \nbanc to correct it. And then there is always the appeal or petition to \nthe Supreme Court of the United States.\n  One thing that has troubled me is the unwillingness of Senators to \nconcede that both sides have been wrong--to make the explicit \nconcession that their side has been wrong at least in part.\n  I have scoured the Record and noted a comment made by the leader of \nthe Democrats, Senator Reid, who said this on May 19:\n\n       Let's not dwell on what went on in the 4 years of President \n     Bush's administration. I am sure there is plenty of blame to \n     go around. As we look back, I am not sure--and it is \n     difficult to say this and I say it--I am not sure either was \n     handled properly. I have known it wasn't right to simply bury \n     69 nominations. And in hindsight, maybe we could have done \n     these 10 a little differently.\n\n  It seems to me that we really ought to be able to admit the wrongs on \nboth sides--to have a clean slate, to start over and try to have \nSenators vote their individual consciences on matters such as \nfilibusters. In talking to my colleagues who are Democrats, I heard \nmany say they did not like the systematic filibusters; it was not the \nright thing to do. But there is a party straitjacket on, so it is done. \nSimilarly, in the Republican cloakroom and Republican caucus, many of \nmy colleagues voiced objections to the so-called constitutional or \nnuclear option. But there again, party loyalty has come into play.\n\n  We have admitted our mistakes in the past, historical mistakes, \negregious mistakes on race, women's suffrage and women's rights, the \nrights of criminal defendants, and many, many things. It would not be \ntoo much for both sides to say we have both been wrong and let's move \nahead. But there has been payback and payback, and the American people \nare sick and tired of the rankling.\n  When you put aside those factors, I suggest that State Supreme Court \nJustice Janice Rogers Brown stacks up fine against the long litany of \ncircuit judges who have been confirmed by the Senate. We know the \ndetails. I spoke at length on this nomination on Monday of this week, \nbefore the floor became congested with many Senators who wanted to \nspeak, and spoke at that time in my capacity as chairman of the \ncommittee. Now I have been allotted 10 minutes to speak as we wind down \nthis debate.\n  Her record is really exemplary. She was born in Alabama in 1949 to \nsharecroppers. She had an excellent record\n\n[[Page S6215]]\n\nin college and in law school. She went back to get a master's degree \nfrom the University of Virginia after she was on the State supreme \ncourt in California.\n  She has been pilloried for statements that have been made in \nspeeches. As is well known, not to be unduly repetitious--I made a \ncomment about this on Monday--if everybody in public life, including \nSenators, were held to everything they have said, none of us would be \nelected, confirmed, appointed, or asked to do anything in the public \nsphere. If somebody put a microscope on the countless tracks of \nstatements I have made in the Congressional Record--a court reporter is \ntaking this down, and it will be in the Congressional Record forever--\nif I were to be suggested for some important job, it is not hard to \nfind something someone has said at some time that would be a \ndisqualifier.\n  The proof is in the pudding on her cases. She has handled a lot of \ncases, and I went through those cases in great detail.\n  It is true that she has made undiplomatic statements, but she is not \nin the State Department. In speeches, she has talked about limiting \nGovernment, but when her cases were reviewed and analyzed, she has \nupheld the authority of the Government in many lines which I detailed \nin a speech the day before yesterday. Similarly, she has upheld \nindividual rights.\n  On the merits, this is a nominee who, in my view, is worthy of \nconfirmation to the Court of Appeals.\n  On Monday, I made a brief reference to an opinion by Supreme Court \nJustice Oliver Wendell Holmes about 80 years ago where he talks about \nthe importance of individualization, free thinking, and free speech, \nand has one of the most poignant phrases in any Supreme Court opinion: \nthat ``time has upset many fighting faiths.'' Time has upset many \nfighting faiths, and in the free interplay of ideas, we come to the \nbest values and the best ideas in the marketplace.\n  If you have a nominee who exercises some independence and \nindividuality in her speeches but has solid judicial opinions and a \nsolid professional record, solid work in the State government, that is \nthe test as to whether she ought to be confirmed. If it were not party \npayback time, this ferocious debate would not be undertaken. That is \nwhy I am going to vote to confirm State supreme court justice Janice \nRogers Brown.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate invoked cloture on the \nnomination now before this body. That came about as a result of a \nbipartisan agreement that was reached several weeks ago. The agreement, \nthough, did not proclaim in any way that Justice Brown would be \nconfirmed. The agreement does not obligate any Senator to vote for this \nor any other nominee. Nor did the agreement establish Janice Rogers \nBrown as the benchmark for what is acceptable, as far as judicial \nnominees go.\n  Whether one is from the left or the right, this nominee should be \nrejected. We should reject any nominee who twists the law to advance \nhis or her own ideological bent. We should reject any nominee who does \nnot believe in or abide by precedent, and we should reject any nominee \nwho holds deep hostility to Government, such deep hostility that it \nrenders them blind to what the law mandates.\n  Janice Rogers Brown does not fail on just one of these standards, she \nfails on all three. She is an exceptional candidate, there is no \nquestion--but in a negative sense. She twists the law and does it \nroutinely. She does not follow precedent. She has a hostility to \nGovernment I have never seen in a judge at any time during my years as \na lawyer and as a member of a legislative body.\n  Under these standards, of course, her nomination should fail \nresoundingly. In speeches and opinions, Janice Rogers Brown has \nrepeatedly assailed protections for the elderly, for workers, for the \nenvironment, for victims of racial discrimination. If confirmed today, \nshe will be a newly empowered person to destroy those protections. Why? \nBecause the D.C. Circuit, where she is intending to go, is the second \nmost powerful court in our land. It has special jurisdiction over \nprotections for the environment, for consumers, for workers, for women, \nfor the elderly. Putting her on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals is \ntruly like putting the fox in to guard the henhouse.\n  The concerns about this woman have not been developed in the last 6 \nmonths. Deep concerns over her objectivity and fairness, or lack \nthereof, have followed her through her whole career. In 1996, when \nJustice Brown was up for her current job--that is a member of the \nSupreme Court of the State of California--she was rated unqualified by \na 23-member commission that was set up by the State of California to \nreview people going to the court. Twenty out of 23 said she was \nunqualified to be a member of the California Supreme Court. The \ncommission specifically found that as a lower court judge, Brown \nexhibited:\n\n     a tendency to interject her political and philosophical views \n     into her opinions.\n\n  Press reports at the time indicated that commission members had \nreceived complaints that she was insensitive to established legal \nprecedent, lacked compassion, lacked intellectual tolerance for \nopposing views, and misapplied legal standards.\n  These are not the words coming from Democratic Senators. This is from \na commission set up to review candidates the Governor was going to \nappoint in the State of California. They found her unqualified, not by \na narrow margin--overwhelmingly. Twenty out of the 23 said she was \nunqualified.\n  I will say one thing, in the 10 years since they did their work, the \nState commission has been proven to be visionary, to have had \nforesight, because she has definitively proven them right. She has \nestablished a record as a habitual lone dissenter who lacks an open \nmind. I heard one of the Senators over here on the majority side say \nthere have been other dissents. She dissented alone 31 times. In a \nRepublican supreme court--6 of the 7 members are Republicans--she has \ndissented alone 31 times.\n  Justice Brown's record is the record of a judge who would discard the \nfoundation of our basic legal system, precedent, in order to elevate \nher own extreme views over the law.\n  When I was going to law school, they taught us a lot of Latin terms. \nOne of the Latin terms they have in the law we learned as new law \nstudents is something called stare decisis. What do those words mean? \nThey are Latin words that mean ``to stand by decided matter.'' It \nstands for certainty. Janice Rogers Brown is a judge; she is not a \nlegislator. She has no right to do the things she does. I am \ndumbfounded that we are going to have Republican Senators who have \ndecried for decades about activism--she is the epitome of an activist \njudge. She does not follow precedent. She is not a legislator, she is a \njudge.\n  This is not Harry Reid coming up with some new theory. In Federalist \nPaper 78, the brilliant Alexander Hamilton wrote, explaining the \nimportance of a judiciary bound by precedent:\n\n       To avoid arbitrary discretion in the courts it is \n     indispensable that they should be bound by strict rules and \n     precedent.\n\n  Yet we are going to have people on the other side of the aisle walk \nover here and vote for this woman. She stands for everything I have \nheard my Republican colleagues rail against for years. The fact that \nyou are a so-called conservative does not make your activism any \nbetter. I believe in stare decisis. When the Court over here across the \nstreet renders a decision based on precedent, I support that. I don't \nlike judges to be legislators and that is what she is.\n  I think it would be hard to find a Senator, if the truth came out, \nwith everyone being candid, who would not agree with Hamilton's view. \nBut with Brown we have a nominee who doesn't believe in precedent. She \nnot only doesn't believe in it, she doesn't abide by it. Here are a few \nexamples.\n  In the case called People v. McKay, she argued against existing \nprecedent by saying:\n\n       If our hands are tied it behooves us to gnaw through the \n     ropes.\n  To gnaw through the ropes of precedent? Why did Alexander Hamilton \nwant judges bound by precedent? Because you need stability in the law. \nYou can't have judges acting as legislators. That is what people \ncomplain about. I thought most of the complaints about this problem, in \nfact, came from this side of the aisle.\n\n[[Page S6216]]\n\n  In Kasky v. Nike, she argued for overturning precedent because it \n``did not take into account realities of the modern world.''\n  That is what we hear. We hear that the Federalist Society and all \nthese other so-called conservative groups who want the Constitution to \nbe interpreted based on the words of that Constitution, not her \n``realities of the modern world.''\n  In People v. Williams, she summarized her views stating she is \n``disinclined to perpetuate dubious law for no better reason than that \nit exists.''\n  How could a judge say that? But she does. These are the words of a \njudicial activist.\n  I said yesterday, when somebody asked me:\n\n       If you like judicial activism, she is a doozy.\n\n  I wanted to make sure I didn't insult her. I went and looked up in \nthe dictionary what a doozy is. Doozy is ``extraordinary.'' She is an \nextraordinary activist, not even a mainstream activist. She is the most \nactivist judge, in my many years in the courts and in the legislature, \nI have ever seen.\n  She has a deep disdain for Government. Don't take my word it. Listen \nto what she says, for example, about Government.\n\n       Where government moves in, community retreats, civil \n     society disintegrates, our ability to control our own \n     destinies atrophies.\n\n  We have a world out there that is looking to America for guidance. \nWhy are they looking to us? It is our ability to govern, our \nGovernment. We are the envy of the rest of the world, with our \nconstitutional form of Government. What does she think of it? Not much.\n  She also says the result of Government is:\n\n       Families under siege; war on the streets; unapologetic \n     expropriation of property; the precipitous decline of the \n     rule of law; the rapid rise of corruption; the loss of \n     civility and the triumph of deceit.\n\n  What world is she living in? She also says the result of Government \nis:\n\n     a debased, debauched culture which finds moral depravity \n     entertaining and virtue contemptible.\n\n  I don't recognize that government she describes. Is a government \nwhich strives to provide children with a better education one which \nleads to war in the streets? Is a government which works to provide \nhealth care to people one which results in families under siege? Is a \ngovernment which protects beautiful landmarks of our land one which \nleads to an unapologetic expropriation of property?\n  I don't think mainstream Americans would agree to this, mainstream \nDemocrats, Republicans, Independents. These views are not those of a \nperson who should be awarded tremendous power in our federal court \nsystem.\n  Take one area of the D.C. Circuit's special jurisdiction, hearing \nappeals from the National Labor Relations Board. These cases involve \nemployee rights to unionize to achieve better health care, better \nwages, and a decent standard of living. In Nevada, our culinary union, \nwhich represents almost 60,000 people who work in our leisure-time \nindustry, has so effectively represented the position of these tens of \nthousands of employees that such jobs are the best jobs for maids, \ncooks, waitresses, waiters, and car valets of any place in the world. \nOver the years, farsighted casino owners have worked with this union \nbecause they know that in the hospitality industry, staff can make or \nbreak an enterprise. Our labor laws encourage businesses to work with \nlaborers so both sides benefit.\n  In 1905, a case was decided by the U.S. Supreme Court called Lochner. \nIt invalidated worker protection laws--things such as how many hours \nyou could work, do you get paid overtime, basic safety measures in the \nworkplace. In Lochner, the U.S. Supreme Court said, No, you can't do \nthat. So for 32 years that was the law of the land.\n  In a unique situation, the Supreme Court said: Times have changed. We \nare going to change that. They did that in 1937. Lochner is a case that \nwe look back at, not with as much dread as the Dred Scott case, but it \nis pretty bad. In that case, the Lochner case, they invalidated the New \nYork labor statute that limited the number of hours employees could \nwork.\n  Over the passionate dissent, and I heard the distinguished chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee, the distinguished Senator Specter from \nPennsylvania talk about Oliver Wendell Holmes--Oliver Wendell Holmes \ndissented in the Lochner case and his dissent was one of the most \nbeautifully written opinions in our history. For decades, Lochner stood \nas a hard-hearted barrier to worker protections enjoyed by Americans \ntoday. Its reversal by the Supreme Court was one of the most pivotal \nmoments in our Nation's history.\n  Where does Janice Rogers Brown come in here? She laments that the \ncase was overturned. She wants to return to the way it used to be. She \nsaid of Holmes' famous dissent in Lochner--in this case he was simply \nwrong. She said the Lochner dissent has troubled me and has annoyed me \nfor a long time.\n  She has compared the demise of Lochner and the worker protections \nthat followed in its wake as a socialist revolution.\n  She seeks to return to Lochner, and if confirmed, she will have power \nto effect those changes she wants. Why should we have a 40-hour \nworkweek, according to Janice Rogers Brown? Why should we have workers \ncompensation law, worker safety laws? Why should people have to be paid \nby their employers overtime? They should not be, according to Janice \nRogers Brown.\n  She has attempted to distinguish between her legal opinions and her \nspeeches, which she said are designed to stir the pot. But she \ncan't. But that is not true. It is simply not true. She is being \ndisingenuous. Her speeches are carried forward in her opinions. The \ninflammatory rhetoric in her speeches carries over into her opinions as \nif copied on the old copying machines.\n\n  For example, in a speech at the Institute of Justice, she said:\n\n       If we can invoke no ultimate limits on the power of \n     government, a democracy is inevitably transformed into a \n     Kleptocracy--a license to steal, a warrant for oppression.\n\n  She wrote an opinion in the San Remo Hotel v. City and County of San \nFrancisco case where she said the same thing, almost identical words:\n\n       Turning a democracy into Kleptocracy does not enhance the \n     stature of thieves; it only diminishes the legitimacy of \n     government.\n\n  In another speech, she assailed senior citizens with this verbiage:\n\n     . . . today's senior citizens blithely cannibalize their \n     grandchildren because they have a right to extract as much \n     ``free'' stuff as a political system will permit them to \n     extract.\n\n  In a case involving discrimination against a senior citizen, \nStevenson v. Superior, she said the same thing--in a dissent, of \ncourse--that California's public policy against age discrimination \ncannot benefit the public. She said that such age discrimination:\n\n     is not . . . Like race and sex discrimination. It does not \n     mark its victims with a stigma of inferiority and second \n     class citizenship; it is an unavoidable consequence of that \n     universal level of time.\n\n  She is saying you get old, you take the consequence, and if you get a \nlittle gray hair and you have worked there 30 years, they can dump you \njust because your hair is gray.\n  I am not making this up. Setting her speeches aside, and these few \nopinions, her judicial opinions are enough to disqualify her for the \njob.\n  There is another case, Aguilar vs. Avis Rent A Car. I cannot in good \ntaste on the Senate floor repeat what this Hispanic employee, Aguilar, \nwas being called in the workplace. I cannot repeat it. They are the \nmost vile words we have in English. I cannot do that. I have them. I \ncannot do that. Vile. What did she say? There was a race discrimination \nsuit against an employee who had repeatedly been subjected to racial \nslurs. She argued the slurs were protected by the first amendment. \nWhile the majority soundly rejected this defense, she, in her single \ndissent, endorsed these people being able to say that. I am not making \nthis up. She argued that even an illegal racial discriminatory speech \nin the workplace--discrimination prohibited by title VII of our Civil \nRights Act--is protected by the first amendment. She believes racial \nslurs in the workplace are acceptable in America. This is a woman who \nis going to the second highest court in the land?\n  Take another case, Konig v. Fair Employment and Housing Commission.\n\n[[Page S6217]]\n\nThere--again in a dissent, what else--she argued that an African-\nAmerican police officer who had been discriminated against should not \nbe awarded damages for this illegal conduct perpetrated against her.\n  In her world, discrimination is without an effective remedy, and \nwrongdoers are rewarded.\n  While she displays hostility toward victims of discrimination--\nwilling to twist the law to deny relief--she exhibits the opposite view \nwhen it comes to corporations. Corporations can do no wrong.\n  In Kasky v. Nike, the plaintiff sued Nike, alleging Nike had engaged \nin false and misleading advertising in a false campaign to deny it had \nmistreated its overseas workers. The majority held that these false \nstatements were not protected by the Constitution. Again, in dissent, \nJustice Brown argued they are protected.\n  Under Justice Brown's reasoning of this case, corporate lies should \nbe protected and public protections rejected. That was her opinion.\n  As the Enron wrongdoers finally head to trial 4 years after they \ndestroyed the retirement security of its employees and devastated \ninvestors, do we want a judge who believes that corporate lies are \nprotected by the Constitution?\n  Justice Brown also believes that the takings clause of the \nConstitution should be transformed into a weapon to tear government \ndown. For example, in the San Remo case, a hotel owner challenged a \ncity permitting requirement. In dissent--again--she argued this scheme \nwas a taking of property requiring compensation under the Constitution. \nHer assertion that a permit fee was a taking requiring compensation is \ntotally at odds with longstanding U.S. Supreme Court precedent. That \ndoes not matter to her. Her radical view would mandate compensation for \neverything. That is her point. She does not want government and her \nview is a way to achieve that end.\n  If you disapprove of zoning laws which keep strip clubs and factories \nfrom opening next door to your house, or an adult bookstore, if you \ndislike the environmental process which saved the bald eagle, our \ngolden eagle, if you oppose the communication laws which protect our \nchildren from indecent programming, then Janice Rogers Brown is your \nkind of a judge. She does not believe in these protections and wants to \ntwist the Constitution to abolish them.\n  I said she was a doozy as an activist, and I think I have proven my \ncase. Her views, in my word and I think the word of the American \npeople, are absurd. They are without any basis in the law. They should \nnot be given voice on the DC Circuit.\n  I say to my colleagues, to the American people, if you believe in \nAmerica--and I know we do--where workers are entitled to a fair wage \nfor a fair day's work, where racial slurs are not condoned, where \ndiscrimination is not tolerated, where corporations are not given \nlicense to lie, where senior citizens are valued and honored, where we \nhave protections for the air we breathe, the food we eat, the water we \ndrink, and these are embraced instead of evaded, if you believe in \nthese things, no one in good conscience can approve this nomination. \nThe record is too clear, too disturbing, too expansive.\n\n  The influence of this court, the DC Circuit Court, is too important, \ntoo fundamental to the rights Americans hold dear. If there were ever a \nnominee whom my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, should reject, \nthis is it.\n  This bipartisan rejection would do more to change the tenor of the \ndebate on judicial nominations than any step we could take. It would \nsend a signal to President Bush that while we may confirm the \nconservative nominee--and we have confirmed 209 so far--the Senate will \nnot approve results-oriented activist ideologues to our Federal courts. \nIt would breathe new life into the ``advice'' part of the advice and \nconsent clause of our Constitution, encouraging partnership between the \nPresident and the Congress.\n  The American people want to see us--Democrats and Republicans--\nworking together to improve the retirement security, their health care, \ntheir children's education. Because of the time we have spent on judges \nfor weeks and weeks, we will never catch up. We have the Energy bill to \ndo. We have the armed services bill we have to do. We have TANF. We \nhope to do something on estate tax. It goes on and on. It is all \ncatchup time. Why? Because of five judges and the President did not get \nhis way. And it will be catchup time for a long time because of it.\n  The people want to see us work together. They want to see the \nPresident bring forward fair judicial nominees who will not bring an \nideological agenda to this body, whether liberal or conservative, to \nthese lifetime positions. The American people should demand, the Senate \nshould demand, that a nominee possess a fair, open mind, and an \ninstinctual understanding that the job of a judge is not to make law \nbut to interpret our laws. It is this very basic standard that this \nnominee so utterly and completely fails to meet.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this very bad nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in a few moments, we will vote on the \nconfirmation of Justice Janice Rogers Brown to serve on the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the DC Circuit. Justice Brown is a highly qualified \nnominee. She is kind. She is smart. She is thoughtful. She has endured \na protracted and often bitter nominations process with grace and \ndignity. I look forward to her confirmation to the Federal bench in \njust a few short minutes.\n  It has been a long road to get to this point. Justice Brown was \nnominated by the President of the United States in July 2003. She has \nendured 184 questions and nearly 5 hours of debate in the Judiciary \nCommittee hearing, two committee votes--both of which were favorable to \nJustice Brown's nomination--and one failed cloture vote despite \nmajority support among the Members of the Senate. She also answered \nover 120 written questions and sat down for countless meetings with \nindividual Senators. In all, we have debated Justice Brown for over 50 \nhours on the Senate floor.\n  Now, after 2 years, Senators will finally be able to fulfill their \nconstitutional duty of advice and consent on the President's nominee. \nJanice Rogers Brown will finally get an up-or-down vote. She will \nfinally get the courtesy and the respect she deserves.\n  During this 2-year process, Senators on the other side of the aisle \nhave leveled harsh and I believe unfair attacks against Justice Brown. \nA careful review of her record, however, shows Justice Brown has an \nunwavering commitment to judicial restraint and the rule of law.\n  Opponents have called Justice Brown an extremist. But we have heard \nthe bipartisan praises of Justice Brown from those who know her best--\nher former and current colleagues on the California Supreme Court and \nCalifornia Court of Appeals. They agree that Janice Rogers Brown is a \n``superb judge'' and have said that ``she is a jurist who applies the \nlaw without favor, without bias, and with an even hand.''\n\n  Opponents have called Justice Brown ``out of the mainstream.'' Yet, \nas a justice on the California Supreme Court, California voters \nreelected her with 76 percent of the vote, the highest vote percentage \nof all the justices on the ballot. Can 76 percent of Californians be \nout of the mainstream? Senators denying Janice Rogers Brown the \nfairness of an up-or-down vote is what has been out of the mainstream.\n  Justice Brown's life is an inspiring story of the American dream. It \nis an extraordinary journey from a sharecropper's field in segregated \nGreenville, AL, to the California Supreme Court, and to the D.C. \nCircuit Court of Appeals. Thanks to hard work and persistence and a \nstrong intellect, Justice Brown has risen to the top of the legal \nprofession.\n  A true public servant, she has dedicated her life to serving others. \nFor 24 years, she has served in various prominent positions in \nCalifornia State government. In 1996, she became the first African-\nAmerican woman to serve as an associate justice on the California \nSupreme Court, the State's highest court.\n  Janice Rogers Brown is a distinguished, respected, and mainstream \njurist. I am proud that today, after almost 2 years, the Senate will \nfinally give Janice Rogers Brown the vote she has waited so long to \nreceive.\n  With the confirmation last week of Justice Owen and the upcoming vote\n\n[[Page S6218]]\n\non Justice Brown, the Senate continues to make progress, placing \nprinciple before partisan politics and results before rhetoric. I hope \nwe can continue working together to do our constitutional duty as \nSenators and give other judicial nominees the fair up-or-down votes \nthey deserve.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  All time is expired.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Janice R.

PRYOR TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR \n                     THE ELEVENTH DISTRICT--Resumed\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we have just voted to confirm Justice \nJanice Rogers Brown to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. We are making \nprogress. We are securing up-or-down votes on previously blocked \nnominees. We will now turn to another judge who has been considered in \nthe past, Judge William H. Pryor.\n  For the information of our colleagues, we are going to go immediately \nto the cloture vote. If cloture is invoked on the Pryor nomination, it \nis my expectation that we will be able to lock in a time certain for \nthe final up-or-down vote on that nomination. That would be for \ntomorrow. The Democratic leader and I have consulted back and forth, \nand we will lock in a vote for 4 p.m. tomorrow, if cloture is invoked \nthrough the next vote.\n  Following that vote, tomorrow we will consider the Sixth Circuit \nnominations and hopefully not use all of the allocated time to which we \npreviously agreed. We will be doing that after the vote tomorrow, and \nwe will be voting on those nominations, as well, tomorrow--late \nafternoon, hopefully, maybe early evening.\n  President Bush nominated Judge Pryor on April 9, 2003, to serve on \nthe Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  While the individual nominees may change, the debate continues to be \ncentered on a simple and unequivocal principle.\n  It is based on fairness, and it is grounded in the Constitution of \nour great Nation.\n  It is the principle that every judicial nominee that comes to this \nfloor deserves an up or down vote.\n  Judge Pryor is also a qualified nominee. He deserves a fair vote, and \nit is our duty to cast one.\n  Judge Pryor has broad legal experience as a public servant, as a \npracticing attorney, and as a law professor.\n  Judge Pryor has served with distinction on the appellate bench since \nhe was recess appointed last year. Many of his opinions have been \nsupported by judges appointed by both Democrats and Republicans.\n  He enjoys bipartisan support inside and outside the Senate chamber.\n  Yet he has had to wait more than 2 years for a fair, simple, and \ncourteous up or down vote on the Senate floor.\n  It is time to close debate and vote on this nominee, up or down, yes \nor no, confirm or reject.\n  I will continue to work to ensure that Judge Pryor and every other \njudicial nominee get an up-or-down vote on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate.\n  We are working on a process to start the Energy bill next week, as \nwell as to consider the Griffith nomination on Monday and will announce \nmore on that schedule tomorrow. But Members should expect a vote Monday \nevening.\n  That pretty much outlines, I believe, the schedule for tonight and \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding the vote Monday will \nbe around 6 o'clock rather than our normal 5:30 p.m. time.\n  Mr. FRIST. That is correct. The vote will be at approximately 6 \no'clock instead of the usual 5 o'clock on Monday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport Executive Calendar No. 100.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of William H.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Lott are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. LOTT. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in the last hour or so we made huge \nprogress on an issue that has been very difficult for this body over \nthe last 3 to 4 weeks, in fact I would say difficult for the last 2\\1/\n2\\ years. The progress we have made is that for these nominees who had \nnot received a fair up-or-down vote for 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, we \nare finally back in gear and getting up-or-down votes, fulfilling our \nconstitutional responsibility of advice and consent.\n  I am very pleased and I am very proud of this body. People who have \nbeen blocked for partisan reasons in the past, who have been \nobstructed, have been prevented from getting votes, have been allowed \nto get votes through regular order by going through the Judiciary \nCommittee. Although it took way too long--2 years, 3 years, 4 years--\nfinally they have been allowed to get an up-or-down vote. I hope it \nsets the tone, and I believe it will set the tone, as we proceed over \nthe coming weeks and months and address circuit court nominees and, of \ncourse, Supreme Court nominees who may or may not occur in the very \nnear future.\n  Justice Janice Rogers Brown will now serve on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the D.C. Circuit. The vote was 56 to 43, a bipartisan vote, \nwhich shows that once these up-or-down votes are allowed and the body \ncan express itself the will of the Senate will work and that this \nhighly qualified nominee, as I mentioned a bit ago, who is kind, smart, \nthoughtful, and qualified, who has had to endure a lot of protracted \nand often bitter nomination discussions, is now going to be on the D.C. \nCircuit. The will of the Senate expressed itself. The bipartisan vote \nwas 56 to 43.\n  This last vote on William Pryor, the fact that in the past he had \nbeen obstructed through a partisan leadership-led effort in the past, \nonce we sort of broke through that impasse, he received 67 votes on \ncloture. The vote was 67 to 32, overwhelming bipartisan support, which \nnow will guarantee him what has been denied in the past, and that is a \nfair up-or-down vote. Again, the body will be able to speak.\n  Everybody who sits at these desks, the people who are in the Chamber \nnow, will be able to express themselves with a vote. That is how we \ngive advice and consent. The vote was 67 to 32. Tomorrow at 4, he, too, \nwill get an up-or-down vote, confirm or reject, on whether Members \nbelieve he is a qualified nominee. Members can vote their conscience, \nvote their judgment of his qualifications. The candidate, the nominee, \nwill receive the up-or-down vote he deserves.\n  We should treat these nominees with respect and in a reasonable \nperiod of time when they come to the floor, or they make it to this \nExecutive Calendar, so that they receive that up-or-down vote.\n  I am very pleased where we are. It is huge progress. Both sides of \nthe aisle are working together on this very important judicial nominee \nprocess. We will continue that process tomorrow in which case by the \nend of tomorrow we should have three more up-or-down votes at 4, again \ntremendous progress. Two of the Michigan judges will be voted on \nsometime late afternoon or early evening. They will be given up-or-down \nvotes, and I expect all three will be confirmed.\n  I believe we have broken the impasse, as I have said, and we are \nmaking real progress. The early part of next week we will be having one \nmore up-or-down vote. That will be on Tom Griffith, and then we will go \nto the Energy bill. We want to spend plenty of time to give everybody \nthe opportunity to debate and amend. I expect we would spend that whole \nfirst week and likely into that second week which would give everybody \nthe opportunity to come forward and express themselves on a bill that I \nbelieve will lower gasoline prices--I cannot say that with certainty, \nbut I believe this bill will--and will lower natural gas prices. For \npeople who are thinking about driving on vacations, driving to work, \ndriving their truck, or worried about heating in the future, the \nAmerican people will know we are doing the Nation's business, that we \nare doing our very best to lower those prices for them as individuals.\n  I am pleased where we are today. We are making real progress. I know \nthere will be some other comments made tonight before we close.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay a special tribute to \nAnge1 Campbell. She is my counsel and director of my Special Projects \nOffice. This outstanding staffer will be leaving my office after 8 \nyears of exceptional service to spend more time with her growing \nfamily.\n  Angel is the epitome of a dedicated, hard-working public servant. She \nhas been remarkably gifted at advocating for Mississippi, the place we \nboth call home, to Federal executives in the many government \ndepartments and to fellow congressional staffers. I know that many \nconstituents from the State of Mississippi will also feel her absence. \nThere are many staffers working in Congress who will miss her detailed, \nknowledgeable explanations of the infrastructure features that are \nunique to our home State to help them while drafting legislative \ninitiatives. And that is why I want to take a moment with my colleagues \nto recognize and to thank Angel for her many genuine contributions to \nmy office and to the citizens of Mississippi.\n  Angel is a native of Southaven, MS. She received her bachelor's \ndegree from the University of Mississippi and later earned her law \ndegree from Samford University. She and her husband, Terry, have three \nwonderful and energetic children; Taylor, Trey, and Jackson. Even as \nher family grew while on my staff, she continued to balance her \npriorities and served both her family and Mississippi well.\n\n[[Page S6220]]\n\n  Angel truly loved fixing the problems and challenges our Mississippi \nconstituents called and wrote about. She understood their frustrations \nand would take them to heart. Then she would dedicate herself to \nsolving their individual cases while simultaneously looking for a \nsystemic solution to save others the same aggravation. To say that \nAngel was relentless in finding answers to difficult problems is an \nunderstatement. She aggressively worked for each and every \nMississippian. She became so proficient in her responsibilities, other \ncongressional staffers, and even some of our colleagues, would often \nseek her advice.\n  Angel had several hats and one vital job was that of providing \nexcellent legal advice to everyone in the office. In a time frame when \nmany large legal matters were being considered, like the confirmation \nof judges to tort reform to class action reforms, the staff needed and \nvalued her wisdom. She could clearly explain the law and the bill's \nprovisions in ways that were understandable. She was there to teach and \nlead the staff.\n  Angel started as one of my staff assistants, but she quickly moved up \nthe ladder to become the director of my special projects. There she \nalso had direct responsibility for a wide range of appropriation \nmatters that affect all facets of Mississippi's life. She was a leader \nwith a steady confident managerial style that was accepted by our new \nand young staffers. She rapidly molded them into experienced staffers \nwho became effective surefooted Mississippi advocates who helped \n``shepherd'' hundreds of millions of infrastructure and business \ninvestments dollars into Mississippi.\n  Angel looked beyond constituent complaints and appropriation issues, \nthat were important, and also devoted time to a much larger problem \narea, the root of many of the constituent challenges. She helped create \na long term program for economic development and creating \ntransportation, communication, technology infrastructure solutions for \nMississippi. She ensured that these projects, both big and small, were \nboth sustainable and cordinated with the State government. She ensured \nthat no corner of the State was ignored and she was always looking for \nways to leverage an idea into reinforcing the existing economic \ndevelopment aspects of Mississippi's marketplace. This was especially \nchallenging because of the dynamics of the State, but because Angel was \ntrusted by numerous local officials and she got it done. In this \ncapacity she made many lasting tangible contributions that ``will \npositively affect Mississippi for decades to come. There are many \nMississippians who have jobs because of her vision and stick-to-it-\nness.\n\n  It is simply not possible to point out all of the contributions Angel \nmade to Mississippi, but I would like to highlight three of the major \nones.\n  First, let me mention I-69. This interstate highway, which will \neventually connect the United States with Canada and Mexico, will run \nthrough Mississippi in DeSoto County and the Delta because of Angel's \nfocused hard work and determination. Many folks said I-69 would never \nbe built. Boy, did she prove these naysayers wrong. She helped secure \nover $100 million for the Greenville Bridge over the Mississippi River \nand the first segments of this interstate are currently under \nconstruction in DeSoto and Tunica Counties. I-69 will provide the \nimpoverished Mississippi Delta with the opportunity to market itself to \ncompanies around the world and hopefully this region of our State can \ntake its place in the new global economy with this infrastructure.\n  Second, let me mention the Nissan Plant. Many were involved in \ngetting the company to decide on Mississippi and many had the grad \nideas, but Angel was part of a small cadre of folks who turned the \nideas into reality by knocking down the bureaucratic, regulatory \nbarriers to make the idea a reality. Eighteen months after the \nannouncement, the field I would I drive past in Canton is now a \nbustling factory producing quality vehicles driven and loved by \nthousands of Americans. We can thank Angel for her tireless work behind \nthe scenes on one of the largest economic development projects in the \nUnited States in recent years. The new Nissan plant represents \napproximately $950 million in direct investment and almost 4,000 new \njobs for the people of Mississippi. These numbers do not include the \ncountless spin-offs and suppliers which have been needed for such a \nmassive undertaking. Nissan's positive ripple effect on the Mississippi \neconomy will be felt for decades to come.\n  Finally, let me mention Angel's instrumental role in securing \nmillions of dollars for Mississippi transportation projects such as the \nCanal Road Connector, improving Mississippi's formula for receipt of \nhighway funds, and for retaining existing jobs at the Babcock & Wilcox \nplant in West Point, MS.\n  These are just a few of the things that Angel Campbell has been \ninvolved with during her tenure with me. I know everyone will miss \nseeing Angel on a regular basis and I will miss her work, her spunk and \nher good cheer and humor. She has been a valuable asset to me and \ntrusted advisor. Everyone in the office benefited from her energy and \nenjoyed her company.\n  It saddens me to see Angel depart my staff, yet I fully understand \nthe priorities of her family. I respect her desire to watch her \nchildren grow. Her husband and children have many reasons to be proud \nof her work her in the Senate for nearly a decade. She made a \nMississippi difference, a difference that will be seen and felt for the \nnext decade. I will be forever grateful for her loyal service and \ndedication to me, and to the State of Mississippi. I wish Angel \nCampbell good luck and pray God may continue to richly bless her and \nher family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/08/senate-section/article/S6220-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6220-S6221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO LOUIS EDWARD ``SPANKY'' FISTER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Louis \nEdward Fister, a Kentuckian who was committed not only to his family \nand friends, but to his country and his religion as well. Known to many \nsimply as ``Spanky,'' Mr. Fister was a permanent deacon in the Roman \nCatholic Church, a calling he served for 20 years. He was also an \ninfluential realtor and sales representative in the Lexington area. Mr. \nFister passed away April 30, 2005, at the age of 66.\n  Spanky got his nickname as a child because he reminded people of \nSpanky from ``The Little Rascals.'' Perhaps the name stuck because \nSpanky made it his goal to create ``gangs of people,'' especially \nduring his ministerial work. One of Spanky's greatest joys was serving \nas a chaplain for Eastern State Hospital where he ministered to the \npatients and offered prayer services. He also witnessed marriage vows, \nbaptisms, and assisted with funerals in Lexington and the surrounding \narea as a deacon at St. Paul Catholic Church in Lexington.\n  Born in Jackson, TN, on January 3, 1939, Mr. Fister moved to Kentucky \nwhen he was about 4 years old and lived the rest of his life in the \nCommonwealth. He graduated from Lexington Catholic High School in 1956. \nFollowing graduation, he joined the U.S. Army and served until 1958. He \nthen studied business at the University of Kentucky and later attended \nThomas More College in preparation for the diaconate. He earned a BA \ndegree in organizational management from Midway College, graduating \nwith Summa Cum Laude honors in 1998.\n  Mr. Fister was a member of the Lexington Board of Realtors and worked \nfor Smith Realty Group before his passing. He was also an independent \nsales representative for Unishippers. A civic-oriented individual, Mr. \nFister was president of the Jaycees and had been active in the Knights \nof Columbus.\n  Mr. Fister is survived by his wife of 45 years, Nancy Jo Hostetter, \nand his five children, all of Lexington; his four siblings; eight \ngrandchildren; and two sisters-in-law.\n\n[[Page S6221]]\n\n  Today I ask my colleagues to join me in expressing our sympathy to \nthe family and friends of the late Louis Edward ``Spanky'' Fister. He \nwill be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/08/senate-section/article/S6221-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PULMONARY FIBROSIS FOUNDATION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak today in order to \nrecognize the fifth anniversary of the Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation. \nThis foundation, headquartered in Chicago, strives to educate, \nadvocate, and fund research on pulmonary fibrosis, a terminal lung \ndisease.\n  A few weeks ago, the Daily Herald, a newspaper based in Arlington \nHeights, Illinois, published a story about the Lukasik family. John A. \nLukasik died at the age of 58, just 9 weeks after he was diagnosed with \npulmonary fibrosis. Mr. Lukasik and his family didn't know anyone with \nthe disease, or what to expect from it. After Mr. Lukasik passed away, \nhis daughter Jennifer Bulandr helped organize support groups and joined \nthe Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation as director of community relations. \nMrs. Bulandr wanted to be a part of the solution in helping those with \npulmonary fibrosis. The Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation has provided a \nchannel for her--and many others--to reach this goal.\n  Since the formation of the Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation in 2000, it \nhas succeeded in raising crucial funds to research a disease that kills \napproximately 40,000 people annually. While the progression of the \ndisease, along with factors relating to its origin, are not fully \nunderstood, there are a variety of causes--inhaled environmental and \noccupational pollutants, certain medications or drugs, genetics, and \ntherapeutic radiation contribute to the progression of the disease.\n  Pulmonary fibrosis has a number of effects on people. It causes \nshortness of breath, discomfort in the chest, and fatigue. Once scar \ntissue is formed on the lungs, it cannot be removed. Although \nmedication can limit the inflammation of the lungs caused by pulmonary \nfibrosis, there is no cure.\n  The foundation is dedicated to finding a cure and raising awareness \nabout pulmonary fibrosis. It seeks to improve quality of life for the \npeople affected by the disease through support services for patients \nand their families.\n  It is my pleasure to congratulate the Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation \non the occasion of its fifth anniversary and to commend the foundation \nfor its efforts to find a cure and help those who suffer from this \ndevastating illness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/08/senate-section/article/S6221-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CLEAN SPORTS ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleagues \nSenator McCain and Senator Stevens, to cosponsor the Clean Sports Act \nof 2005. While I regret that we have had to come to this point, it is \nclear that Major League Baseball and other professional leagues are \nmore concerned with protecting their own collective bargaining rights \nthan doing the right thing.\n  Unfortunately, the abuse of illegal steroids by professional athletes \nis something we can no longer ignore. Steroid use is now affecting the \nmost impressionable and vulnerable among us. The most recent studies \nindicate that as many as 5 percent to 7 percent of students, even as \nyoung as middle school, have admitted to using illegal steroids. \nClearly we must act to curb this growing problem.\n  Every day, millions of young people dream of one day playing in the \nbig leagues. When superstar athletes, with their multimillion-dollar \ncontracts and lucrative endorsements are seen using steroids to improve \ntheir performance, it should not be surprising that many young athletes \nwould want to use steroids to improve their own performance.\n  Professional athletes must be held to a higher standard when it comes \nto illegal substances such as steroids. Like it or not, young people \nlook up to professional athletes as role models. The Clean Sports Act \nwill require all professional sports leagues to adopt a unified \nstandard for testing as well as tougher penalties for an athlete found \nin violation of these standards. Unlike testing today, this act will \nrequire athletes to test during the off-season and frequently during \ntheir season of play. Athletes will face severe penalties for a \npositive test: 2-year ban for the first offense and a lifetime ban for \nthe second.\n  I have little doubt that this will go a long way to rid professional \nsports of these dangerous substances and bring integrity back to the \ngame. We must send a strong message to professional athletes. If you \nchoose to cheat and use illegal steroids, you risk ending your career. \nIn turn, our young people will hopefully get the message that using \nsteroids to improve athletic performance is absolutely the wrong way to \ngo.\n  While this bill specifically addresses professional athletics, the \nimportance of stopping steroid abuse extends well beyond the track, \nbaseball diamond, or football field. We must continue to focus on the \nhealth and future of our children. I encourage my colleagues to join in \nsupport of this legislation to set the standard for fair competition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/08/senate-section/article/S6221-3", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL HUNGER AWARENESS DAY\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, yesterday was National Hunger Awareness \nDay. Second Harvest, the lead sponsor of the June 7 observance, has \nperformed an important public service in challenging us to reflect on \nthe very real problem of hunger in America. I commend Second Harvest \nand all the sponsoring organizations for their efforts.\n  Our Nation has enormous wealth, and yet far too many Americans must \ndeal with the pain and consequences of hunger. Approximately 36 million \nAmericans, including 13 million children, are ``food insecure''--quite \nsimply inadequately nourished.\n  Hunger may be more subtler in its manifestations and effects than \nmalnutrition but it relentlessly undermines health, and it compromises \none's ability to do well in school or on the job. Inadequate nutrition \nin children correlates with anemia, stunted growth, weight loss and \nextreme fatigue. Studies done by the highly respected Center on Hunger, \nPoverty and Nutrition Policy at Tufts University show that inadequate \nnutrition can adversely affect a child's achievement in school. Hunger \nalso can cause severe anxiety and depression.\n  Although Congress has taken measures to prevent hunger and food \ninsecurity, much remains to be done. Federally funded programs like the \nFood Stamp Program and the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, \nInfants and Children, commonly referred to as the WIC program, provide \nassistance to low-income children by improving access to nutritional \nmeals. It is therefore deeply regrettable that the President's 2006 \nbudget has made it more difficult for low-income families to receive \nnutritional assistance. The White House's budget request for the Food \nStamp Program amounts to a staggering cut of more than $500 million \nover 5 years by forcing over 300,000 low-income participants out of a \nprogram that acts as a crucial safety net for millions of Americans. \nSubstantial cuts to the WIC program would result in 670,000 women and \nchildren losing important nutritional assistance by the year 2010. It \nis deeply regrettable that the Budget conference report approved by the \nCongress mandates a mandatory cut of $3 billion in agriculture \nappropriations, leaving Food Stamps and other domestic hunger-relief \nprograms vulnerable.\n  At a time when more families are forced to struggle with unemployment \nand low wages, a lack of affordable housing, rising health care costs, \nand the disappearance of hard-earned pensions, National Hunger Day \nserves to remind us of the need to vanquish hunger; in this prosperous \nNation, there is no reason why millions of Americans should have to \nface the prospect of hunger, or watch their children go hungry. The \nconference report on the fiscal year 2006 budget resolution Budget \nconference report is a callous response to an urgent challenge, and \nNational Hunger Awareness Day is a time to pledge that we will not rest \nuntil the challenge is met.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/08/senate-section/article/S6221-4", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6221-S6222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new\n\n[[Page S6222]]\n\ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society. Likewise, at each Congress \nI have come to the floor to highlight a separate hate crime that has \noccurred in our country.\n  A 25-year-old gay man was physically assaulted by a group of white \nmales last year in Ohio. The victim was followed from a well-known \nColumbus gay bar after the bar closed. The victim was dragged from his \ncar, severely beaten and later found by the Columbus Police Department \nseveral blocks from his car.\n  I believe that the government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/08/senate-section/article/S6222-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING DR. JAMES SCHLESINGER\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the George C. Marshall Institute will honor \nDr. James Schlesinger on June 16 with its Founders Award, which is \ngiven annually in recognition of distinguished contributions to science \nand public policy. This year's award acknowledges Dr. Schlesinger's \nstellar career in public service.\n  James Schlesinger served three presidents as Director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency, Secretary of Defense, and Secretary of Energy. His \ncareer has been a model of dedication to public service, and has been \nmarked by his intelligence, integrity, and commitment to our Nation's \nwell being. We continue to benefit from his wisdom, strength of \ncharacter, and willingness to contribute when called.\n  Dr. Schlesinger's insight and expertise--both during and after his \ntime in government--have been instrumental in winning key policy \nbattles. For example, his active role in the national debate over the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty aided those Senators, myself included, \nwho argued strongly that ratifying the treaty would lead to the decline \nof our nuclear weapons infrastructure and would damage U.S. national \nsecurity interests. There is no doubt that Dr. Schlesinger's stature \nand contribution were instrumental in bringing about the treaty's \ndefeat. Since that time, I have continued to regularly consult with him \non the future of our nuclear capability and other issues. Indeed, Dr. \nSchlesinger's advice on a broad range of key national security issues \nhas been invaluable; I am grateful for his counsel.\n  The Marshall Institute should be commended for recognizing a true \nnational treasure, Dr. James Schlesinger.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am pleased today to note the \nanniversary of the Griswold v. Connecticut Supreme Court decision.\n  Griswold v. Connecticut marked a major turning point for generations \nof women. For the first time, the Supreme Court recognized that women \nhave the fundamental right to make their own, private decisions about \nfamily planning. The decision paved the way for widespread access to \ncontraception that has dramatically reduced unintended pregnancies, \nSTDs, and abortions, and opened the door of opportunity for women to \neducational and career advancement that has made women a critical part \nof our workforce. However, we still have significant work to do. The \nUnited States has one of the highest rates of unintended pregnancies \nand STDs among industrialized nations, and too many women do not have \naccess to basic preventive health care while the ranks of uninsured \nAmericans continue to grow.\n  As we commemorate the Griswold decision, it is critical that we keep \ntaking steps forward to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and \nimprove access to women's health care. Therefore, I have introduced \nlegislation, the Prevention First Act, which would improve women's \nhealth, reduce the rate of unintended pregnancies, and prevent \nabortions. The legislation takes common sense steps towards \nstrengthening access to contraception for women while also reducing \nhealth care costs borne by taxpayers and employers.\n  We should all be able to agree that reducing the number of unintended \npregnancies and improving access to women's health care should be a \npriority. I will continue to fight for the Prevention First bill so \nthat we can keep building on the progress of Griswold v. Connecticut \nfor generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/08/senate-section/article/S6222-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        2005 VERMONT SBA AWARDS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I call to the attention of the Senate \nseveral successful Vermont businesses being honored this year by the \nSmall Business Administration, SBA. An outstanding group of Vermonters \nare being awarded 2005 Vermont Small Business Champion Awards, and the \nprestigious Vermont Small Business Person of the Year Award is being \nawarded to the owner and president of Four Seasons Garden Center, \nOliver Gardner.\n  It is a great pleasure to recognize the enterprises and business \nleaders who will receive Vermont Small Business Champion Awards: Karen \nand Brian Zecchinelli of the Wayside Restaurant, Family-Owned Business \nof the Year; Emily Kaminsky of Community Capital of Central Vermont, \nFinancial Services Champion of the Year; Jean Elizabeth Temple of Jean \nElizabeth's Soap Company, Home-Based Business Champion of the Year; \nPaula Cope of Cope & Associates, Small Business Woman of the Year; \nClaudia Clark of Moosewood Hollow, Vermont Microenterprise of the Year; \nEdward Walbridge of Walbridge Electric, Veteran Small Business Champion \nof the Year; and Linda Ingold of the Vermont Women's Business Center, \nWomen in Business Champion of the Year.\n  I would like to take a moment to draw special attention to my friend \nOliver Gardner, the 2005 Vermont Small Business Person of the Year. His \nFour Seasons Garden Center in Williston is one of Vermont's great small \nbusiness success stories, built on Yankee determination and responsible \nbusiness practices. Gardner was selected for outstanding leadership \nrelated to his company's staying power, employee growth, increase in \nsales, innovative ingenuity, response to adversity, and contributions \nto the community.\n  Following Gardner's purchase of Four Seasons in 1978, the company has \nseen steady growth. Employee numbers have risen from 50 to 98 during \npeak season, and annual revenues have increased from $800,000 in 1977, \nto $4 million, as of October 2004. Now, Four Seasons is considered one \nof Vermont's largest local gardening resources. When Gardner learned of \nthe imminent arrival of Home Depot and Wal-Mart back in 1994, he \nimplemented a dynamic plan to boost Four Seasons' competitive edge. The \nbusiness expanded and relocated to a 10-acre lot less than a mile from \nthe big-box stores in Williston. The plan was a stellar success and \npromoted increased sales at a time when many independent garden centers \nwere closing due to pressure from chain store giants.\n  Despite a progressive, 20-year spinal cord disease that restricts his \nmobility, Gardner has demonstrated extraordinary determination, \npersistence, and creativity. Also exceptional is Gardner's commitment \nto his goals for social and environmental responsibility in business. \nFour Seasons promotes gardening programs for the entire family and \noffers free access to its new facility to all organizations interested \nin gardening and a healthy environment.\n  I congratulate Oliver and all of the 2005 winners, who are accepting \ntheir prestigious awards today in Burlington, for jobs well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/08/senate-section/article/S6222-3", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6222-S6223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               SALUTE TO PORTLAND TRANSMISSION WAREHOUSE\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, as someone who has been involved in \nfamily-owned business for many years, I know the hard work and \nsacrifice it takes to make such a business a success. I also know that \nsmall businesses are the backbone of the American economy and the \neconomy of Oregon. I am very proud today to salute an Oregon small \nbusiness which has achieved some national recognition. Portland \nTransmission Warehouse was recently honored with the ``National Family \nBusiness of the Year'' award for companies with 50 or fewer employees.\n\n[[Page S6223]]\n\n  Portland Transmission Warehouse was founded in 1943, when Gene \nBradshaw fulfilled his dream of opening an automobile repair business. \nJohn Bradshaw--Gene's son--joined his father in the business upon \ngraduating from college in 1964. Ross Bradshaw--John's son--continued \nthe family legacy when he joined the business in 1991. Under the \nleadership of three generations of Bradshaw family members, Portland \nTransmission Warehouse now boasts 20 employees, and has earned a \nreputation for outstanding customer service and for outstanding service \nto the community.\n  For nearly a quarter of a century, Portland Transmission Warehouse \nhas sponsored a neighborhood car show as a thank you to customers and \nthe community. Over the years, the show has grown from 28 cars to over \n500 cars.\n  The Bradshaw family has also understood that their employees are \nreally part of their extended family. Portland Transmission Warehouse \nis hailed by employees as a business that has helped some of them \nthrough some difficult times. It is no wonder that the average tenure \nof Portland Transmission Warehouse employees is 14 years.\n  It was Ronald Reagan who put it best when he said, ``When you're \ntalking about the strength and character of America, you're talking \nabout the small business community, about the owners of that store down \nthe street, the faithful who support their churches and defend their \nfreedom, and all the brave men and women who are not afraid to take \nrisks and invest in the future to build a better America.''\n  I know John Bradshaw and am proud to call him a friend.

A bill to direct the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to \nestablish guidelines and procedures for tracking, controlling, and \naccounting for individual spent fuel rods and segments; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill that is long \noverdue and would require American nuclear power plants to follow the \nsame procedures that we would like to impose on nuclear power plants in \nother countries.\n  Each year, the Nation's nuclear power plants produce over 2,000 \nmetric tons of spent fuel, which is the used fuel that is periodically \nremoved from nuclear reactors. According to the Government \nAccountability Office, GAO, spent nuclear fuel is ``one of the most \nhazardous materials made by humans.'' Within minutes, the intense \nradiation in the fuel can kill a person without protective shielding; \nin smaller doses, the fuel can cause cancer.\n  In the hands of terrorists, such highly radioactive materials, when \ncoupled with conventional explosives, could be turned into a dirty bomb \nthat could pose a critical threat to public safety.\n  In April of this year, GAO issued a report concluding that \n``[n]uclear power plants' performance in controlling and accounting for \nspent nuclear fuel has been uneven.'' In recent years, three U.S. \nnuclear power plants--Millstone, Vermont Yankee, and Humboldt Bay--have \nreported missing spent fuel. The Millstone fuel was never located, the \nVermont Yankee fuel was located three months later in a different \nlocation, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is still \ninvestigating the missing Humboldt Bay fuel. In all three cases, the \nmissing spent fuel had been contained in loose fuel rods or fuel rod \nsegments.\n  Currently, NRC provides little or no guidance on how nuclear power \nplants should conduct physical inventories of their spent fuel or how \nthey must control, store, and account for loose spent fuel rods and \nfragments. NRC also does not conduct routine inspections to monitor \ncompliance with regulations relating to spent fuel.\n  As a result of its investigation, GAO made a series of \nrecommendations for how NRC should improve its regulation and \noversight. My bill--the Spent Nuclear Fuel Tracking and Accountability \nAct--would implement those recommendations and require NRC to \nestablish: 1. specific and uniform guidelines for tracking, \ncontrolling, and accounting for spent fuel rods or segments; and 2. \nuniform inspection procedures to verify compliance with these \nguidelines. Within six months, NRC would be required to report to \nCongress on its progress in establishing these guidelines.\n  Tracking spent nuclear material used in the United States is just as \nimportant as tracking spent nuclear material in the former Soviet \nUnion. This is a common-sense solution to an important problem.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1194\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Spent Nuclear Fuel Tracking \n     and Accountability Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SPENT FUEL RODS.\n\n       (a) Guidelines.--Not later than 260 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \n     shall establish--\n       (1) specific and uniform guidelines for tracking, \n     controlling, and accounting for individual spent fuel rods or \n     segments at nuclear power plants, including procedures for \n     conducting physical inventories; and\n       (2) uniform inspection procedures to verify any action \n     taken by a nuclear power plant to implement those guidelines.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \n     shall submit to Congress a report describing the progress of \n     the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in establishing the \n     guidelines under subsection (a).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  By Mr. STEVENS (for himself and Mr. Inouye) (by request):\n  S. 1195. A bill to provide the necessary authority to the Secretary \nof Commerce for the establishment and implementation of a regulatory \nsystem for offshore aquaculture in the United States Exclusive Economic \nZone, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, by request of the Administration, Senator \nInouye and I introduce today the ``National Offshore Aquaculture Act of \n2005'', a bill to provide the regulatory framework for the development \nof aquaculture in the United States Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). \nConcurrently, we have introduced an amendment to this bill to allow \ncoastal States to decide whether or not they want offshore aquaculture \nin the EEZ off that State's coastline. We are cosponsoring Senator \nSnowe's amendment to strike the Jones Act waiver for vessels supporting \noffshore aquaculture facilities contained in the Administration's bill. \nI am also a cosponsor of Senator Inouye's amendment to better clarify \nlanguage that environmental protections apply. As we review the \nAdministration's measure in detail, there may be additional amendments \noffered to this bill and I look forward to working with my colleagues \nto address any concerns with the legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 1196. A bill to provide for disclosure of fire safety standards \nand measures with respect to campus buildings, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Campus \nFire Safety Right-to-Know Act of 2005''. I first introduced this \nlegislation in the l07th Congress in response to a tragic fire at New \nJersey's Seton Hall University that claimed the lives of three students \nand injured more than fifty others. This legislation is designed to \ncurb the epidemic of dangerous college campus fires.\n  Since the Seton Hall fire, campus fires have continued to take the \nlives of our college students and their families. According to the \nCenter for Campus Fire Safety, more than 75 fire-related deaths have \noccurred in student housing at colleges across the country since \nJanuary of 2000. Campus fires have claimed lives in nearly half the \nStates of this Nation, from New Jersey to Texas, Indiana to \nPennsylvania, and Ohio to right here in Washington, DC. This \nlegislation will finally bring to light the extent of this tragic \ndanger facing our Nation's best and brightest.\n  The ``Campus Fire Safety Right-to-Know Act'' requires disclosure of \nfire safety information on campuses as well as a report from the \nSecretary of Education to Congress on the depth of the problem and \npossible solutions. The bill implements the same procedure that \nrequires schools to disclose crime statistics and other safety \ninformation. While the bill does not mandate colleges to upgrade their \nsystems, it does offer a powerful incentive for them to do so by \nproviding prospective students and their parents the opportunity to \nreview and compare the quality and record of fire safety protections at \nall colleges and universities.\n  Only 35 percent of university-sponsored student housing that suffer \nfires are equipped with sprinkler systems.\n\n[[Page S6229]]\n\nEach year, approximately 1,600 fires break out in dormitories, \nfraternity and sorority houses, and other housing controlled by student \ngroups. Parents and students deserve to know what steps their school \nhas taken to prevent and prepare for these harmful and often fatal \ncatastrophes.\n  The ``Campus Fire Safety Right-to-Know Act'' will put important fire \nsafety information in the hands of students and their parents who \nentrust their children to our Nation's colleges and universities. I \nbelieve this bill will make important strides in the effort to make our \ncollege campuses safer and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1196\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Campus Fire Safety Right-to-\n     Know Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DISCLOSURE OF FIRE SAFETY OF CAMPUS BUILDINGS.\n\n       Section 485 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     1092) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)(1)--\n       (A) by striking ``and'' at the end of subparagraph (N);\n       (B) by striking the period at the end of subparagraph (O) \n     and inserting ``; and''; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(P) the fire safety report prepared by the institution \n     pursuant to subsection (h).''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(h) Disclosure of Fire Safety Standards and Measures.--\n       ``(1) Annual fire safety reports required.--Each \n     institution participating in any program under this title \n     shall, beginning in the first academic year that begins after \n     the date of enactment of the Campus Fire Safety Right-to-Know \n     Act of 2005, and each year thereafter, prepare, publish, and \n     distribute, through appropriate publications (including the \n     Internet) or mailings, to all current students and employees, \n     and to any applicant for enrollment or employment upon \n     request, an annual fire safety report.

A bill to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act of \n1994; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce today the \nintroduction of the Biden/Hatch/Specter Violence Against Women Act of \n2005. Many in this chamber are well aware that I consider the Violence \nAgainst Women Act the single most significant legislation that I've \ncrafted during my 32-year tenure in the Senate. This law is my baby, so \nto speak, and I take very seriously my responsibilities to ensure that \nit is adequately funded and renewed. What was once an infant statute \nseeking legitimacy in the public eye and in the halls of government is \nnow a feisty ten-year law that has made its presence known from Long \nBeach, CA to Dover, DE. But in September 2005, the Act will expire. \nCongress and the President must act quickly in the next three months to \nrenew the backbone of our country's fight to end domestic violence and \nsexual assault, the Violence Against Women Act. We simply cannot let \nthe Act lapse or become buried in partisan bickering.\n  The enactment of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994 was the \nbeginning of a national and historic commitment to women and children \nvictimized by domestic violence and sexual assault. Thus far, our \ncommitment has yielded extraordinary progress. Since the Act's passage, \ndomestic violence has dropped by almost 50 percent. Incidents of rape \nare down by 60 percent. The number of women killed by an abusive \nhusband or boyfriend is down by 22 percent. More than half of all rape \nvictims are stepping forward to report the crime. Over a million women \nhave found justice in our courtrooms and obtained domestic violence \nprotective orders.\n  The Violence Against Women Act provides critical resources so that \nour communities may implement big and small improvements that can make \nall the difference in the world. For instance, in my home State of \nDelaware,\n\n[[Page S6230]]\n\nthe Act's rural grant program helped the Delaware State Police \nestablish fully-equipped, dedicated domestic violence units in two \ncounties. The STOP program provided a Hispanic shelter with funding to \npurchase a van to pick up battered women and their children who have \nnowhere else to turn.\n  Today, we uphold our commitment to America's families. Despite the \nincredible strides made, far too many women remain afraid to go home or \nafraid to tell anyone about the rape that happened at last night's \nparty. We cannot let the Violence Against Women Act become a victim of \nits own success. Instead, we need to usher the Act into the 21st \ncentury and implement it with the next generation--recent police \nacademy graduates who want to be trained on handling family violence, \nnewly elected State legislators who want to update State laws on sexual \nassault, and the next generation of children who must be taught that \nabuse will not be tolerated.\n  Today's achievement--introduction of a bipartisan, compromise bill \nthat both reinvigorates existing programs and creates bold initiatives \nto tackle new issues--has been a year in the making. As I drafted this \nnext iteration of the Violence Against Women Act, I listened closely to \nthe recommendations of those on the front lines to end the violence--\npolice, emergency room nurses, victim advocates, shelter directors, and \nprosecutors--and made targeted improvements to existing grant programs \nand tightened up criminal laws. A wide variety of groups worked hard \nwith Senator Specter, Senator Hatch and I to create this bill, \nincluding the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, the \nNational Network to End Domestic Violence, the Family Violence \nPrevention Fund, Legal Momentum, the National Alliance to End Sexual \nViolence, the National Center for Victims for Crime, the American Bar \nAssociation, the National District Attorneys Association, the National \nCouncil on Family and Juvenile Court Judges, the National Association \nof Chiefs of Police, the National Sheriffs' Association and many \nothers.\n\n  Before previewing the particulars of today's bill, I want to explain \na few of my principles guiding the drafting of the Violence Against \nWomen Act of 2005. First, I remain dedicated to the cornerstone \nprograms in the Act such as the STOP grant program, the Rural Grant \nprogram and the National Domestic Violence Hotline. These are \nenormously successful initiatives that are the scaffolding of the Act. \nThese foundations must be strengthened, not neglected.\n  Second, ending domestic violence and sexual assault has, and will \ncontinue to cost money. This is simply not a goal that can be \naccomplished on the cheap. Our success in ending family violence is not \na signal to reduce funding; rather the opposite is so. We can't afford \nto lose the gains that we have made. We've found a winning combination, \nand Congress should continue to spend its money so effectively.\n  Third, today's bill is an ambitious, but reasoned, effort to solve \nthe next level of challenges for battered women and their children. \nWe've made tremendous strides in treating domestic violence and sexual \nassaults as public crimes with accountable offenders and creating \ncoordinated community responses to help victims. Our next task is to \nlook beyond the immediate crisis and provide long-term solutions for \nvictims, as well as redouble our prevention efforts. Therefore, this \nbill includes important efforts to ease the housing crisis for victims \nfleeing their homes, provide more economic security for victims by \npreserving their employment stability, engage boys and men in \ninitiatives to prevent domestic violence from occurring in the first \nplace, and enlist the healthcare community in identifying and treating \nvictims.\n  My final principle is that ending violence against women is truly a \nshared goal--one that is held by Democrats and Republicans, one that is \nupheld by men and women, and one that is desired by both government and \nby the private sector. The continued success of the Violence Against \nWomen Act depends upon bipartisanship commitment.\n  Today's bill includes the following components. Title I on the \ncriminal justice system includes provisions to: 1. Renew and increase \nfunding to over $400 million a year for existing fundamental grant \nprograms for law enforcement, lawyers, judges and advocates; 2. stiffen \nexisting criminal penalties for repeat Federal domestic violence \noffenders; and 3. update the criminal law on stalking to incorporate \nnew surveillance technology like Global Positioning Systems (GPS).\n  Title II on critical victim services will: 1. Create a new, dedicated \ngrant program for sexual assault victims that will strengthen the 1,300 \nrape crisis centers across the country; 2. reinvigorate programs to \nhelp older and disabled victims of domestic violence; 3. strengthen \nexisting programs for rural victims and victims in underserved areas; \nand 4. increase funding to $5 million annually for the National \nDomestic Violence Hotline.\n  Reports indicate that up to ten million children experience domestic \nviolence in their homes each year. Experts agree that domestic violence \naffects children in multiple, complicated and long-lasting ways. Every \nrisk, every injury, and every disruption that a battered woman endures \nis one that her children experiences as well. The complex impact of \ndomestic violence--fear for one's safety at home, depression, loss of \nincome, moving from the family home, school disruptions and grieving \nfor a father--are complicated and traumatic for children. Treating \nchildren who witness domestic violence, dealing effectively with \nviolent teenage relationships and teaching prevention strategies to \nchildren are keys to ending the violence. Title III includes measures \nto: 1. Promote collaboration between domestic violence experts and \nchild welfare agencies; and 2. enhance to $15 million a year, grants to \nreduce violence against women on college campuses. Title IV focuses on \nprevention strategies and includes programs supporting home visitations \nand specifically engaging men and boys in efforts to end domestic and \nsexual violence.\n  Doctors and nurses, like police officers on the beat, are often the \nfirst witnesses of the devastating aftermath of abuse. As first \nresponders, they must be fully engaged in the effort to end the \nviolence and possess the tools they need to faithfully screen, treat, \nand study family violence. Title V strengthens the health care system's \nresponse to family violence with programs to train and educate health \ncare professionals on domestic and sexual violence, foster family \nviolence screening for patients, and more studies on the health \nramifications of family violence.\n  In some instances, women face the untenable choice of returning to \ntheir abuser or becoming homeless. Indeed, 44 percent of the Nation's \nmayors identified domestic violence as a primary cause of homelessness. \nEfforts to ease the housing problems for battered women are contained \nin Title VI, including: 1. Collaborative grant programs between \ndomestic violence organizations and housing providers; 2. programs to \ncombat family violence in public and assisted housing; and 3. \nenhancements to transitional housing resources.\n  Leaving a violent partner often requires battered women to achieve a \nlevel of economic security. Title VII seeks to help abused women \nmaintain secure employment by permitting battered women to take limited \nemployment leave to address domestic violence, such as attend court \nproceedings, or move to a shelter. This is an issue long championed by \nthe late Senator Wellstone and Senator Murray, and I glad that we are \nable to include this provision in today's bill.\n  Despite the historic immigration law changes made in the Violence \nAgainst Women Act of 2000 that opened new and safe routes to \nimmigration status, battered immigrant women often have a very \ndifficult time escaping abuse because of immigration laws, language \nbarriers, and social isolation. Title VIII's immigration provisions go \na long way toward wresting immigration control away from the batterer \nand pave the way for the victim to leave a violent home. In addition, \nit would ensure that victims of trafficking are supported with measures \nsuch as permitting their families to join them in certain \ncircumstances, expanding the duration of a T-visa, and providing \nresources to victims who assist in investigations or prosecutions of \ntrafficking cases brought by State or Federal authorities.\n\n[[Page S6231]]\n\n  In an effort to focus more closely on violence against Indian women, \nTitle IX creates a new tribal Deputy Director in the Office on Violence \nAgainst Women dedicated to coordinating Federal tribal policy. In \naddition, Title IX authorizes tribal governments to access and upload \ndomestic violence and protection order data on criminal databases, as \nwell as create tribal sex offender registries.\n  I am proud to introduce with Senators Hatch and Specter this \ncomprehensive bill to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. I \nwant to thank Senator Hatch, a longstanding champion on this issue, for \ndiligently working on this bill with Senator Specter and me. Since \n1990, Senator Hatch and I have worked together to end family violence \nin this country, so it is no great surprise that once again he worked \nside-by-side with us to craft today's bill. I am also deeply indebted \nto Senator Kennedy for his unwavering commitment to battered immigrant \nwomen and his work on the bill's immigration provisions. I also thank \nSenator Leahy who has long-supported the Violence Against Women Act and \nin particular, has worked on the rural programs and transitional \nhousing provisions. Finally, I thank my very good friend from \nPennsylvania for his commitment and leadership on this bill. It is a \npleasure to work with Senator Specter. I know that he will adeptly and \nexpeditiously move the Violence Against Women Act through his \nCommittee.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to review today's Violence Against \nWomen Act of 2005 and add their support. I understand that there are \nother proposals that should be considered before the full Senate \ndebates this legislation. Refinements will certainly be made to improve \nwhat is currently in this bill. I welcome any suggestions that you may \nhave, and look forward to coming back to the floor to urge final \npassage of the Violence Against Women Act of 2005.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senators Biden, Hatch, \nSpecter and other cosponsors to introduce today the bipartisan VAWA, \nthe Violence Against Women Act of 2005.\n  Our Nation has made remarkable progress over the past 25 years in \nrecognizing that domestic violence and sexual assault are crimes, \nproviding legal remedies, social supports and coordinated community \nresponses. Millions of women, men, children and families, however, \ncontinue to be traumatized by abuse, leading to increased rates of \ncrime, violence and suffering.\n  I witnessed the devastating effects of domestic violence early in my \ncareer as the Vermont State's Attorney for Chittenden County. Violence \nand abuse affect people of all walks of life every day and regardless \nof gender, race, culture, age, class or sexuality. Such violence is a \ncrime and it is always wrong, whether the abuser is a family member, \nsomeone the victim is dating, a current or past spouse, boyfriend, or \ngirlfriend, an acquaintance or a stranger.\n  The National Crime Victimization Survey estimates there were 691,710 \nnon-fatal, violent incidents committed against victims by current and \nformer spouses, boyfriends or girlfriends now termed intimate partners \nby DOJ--during 2001. Eight-five percent of those incidents were against \nwomen. The rate of non-fatal intimate partner violence against women \nhas fallen steadily since 1993, when the rate was 9.8 incidents per \n1,000 people. In 2001, the number fell to 5.0 incidents per 1,000 \npeople, nearly a 50 percent reduction. Tragically, however, the survey \nfound that 1,600 women were killed in 1976 by a current or former \nspouse or boyfriend, while in 2000 some 1,247 women were killed by \ntheir intimate partners.\n  VAWA became law in 1994 and was reauthorized in 2000. It has provided \naid to law enforcement officers and prosecutors, encouraged arrest \npolicies, stemmed domestic violence and child abuse, established \ntraining programs for victim advocates and counselors, and trained \nprobation and parole officers who work with released sex offenders. \nThis Congress we have the opportunity to reauthorize VAWA and make \nimprovements to vital core programs, tighten criminal penalties against \ndomestic abusers, and create new solutions to challenges in other \ncrucial aspects of domestic violence and sexual assault, such as \ntreating children victims of violence, augmenting health care for rape \nvictims, holding repeat offenders and Internet stalkers accountable, \nand helping domestic violence victims keep their jobs.\n  I am particularly proud to note that included in VAWA 2005 are \nreauthorizations for two programs that I authored. In a small, rural \nSate like Vermont, our county and local law enforcement agencies rely \non cooperative, interagency efforts to combat and solve significant \nproblems. That is why I authored the Rural Domestic Violence and Child \nVictimization Enforcement Grant Program as part of the original VAWA. \nThis program helps services available to rural victims and children by \nencouraging community involvement in developing a coordinated response \nto combat domestic violence, dating violence and child abuse. Adequate \nresources combined with sustained commitment will bring about \nsignificant improvements in rural areas to the lives of those \nvictimized by domestic and sexual violence.\n  The Rural Grants Program section of VAWA 2005 reauthorizes and \nexpands the existing education, training and services grant programs \nthat address violence against women in rural areas. This provision \nrenews the rural VAWA program, extends direct grants to state and local \ngovernments for services in rural areas and expands areas to include \ncommunity collaboration projects in rural areas and the creation or \nexpansion of additional victim services. This provision includes new \nlanguage that expands the program coverage to sexual assault, child \nsexual assault and stalking. It also expands eligibility from rural \nstates to rural communities, increasing access to rural sections of \notherwise highly populated states. This section authorizes $55,000,000 \nannually for 2006 through 2010, which is an increase of $15 million per \nyear.\n  The second grant program I authored that is included in VAWA 2005 is \nthe Transitional Housing Assistance Grants for Victims of Domestic \nViolence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault or Stalking. This program, \nwhich became law as part of the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools \nto End the Exploitation of Children Today, the PROTECT Act of 2003, \nauthorizes grants for transitional housing and related services for \npeople fleeing domestic violence, sexual assault or stalkers. At a time \nwhen the availability of affordable housing has sunk to record lows, \ntransitional housing for victims is especially needed. Today more than \n50 percent of homeless individuals are women and children fleeing \ndomestic violence. We have a clear problem that is in dire need of a \nsolution. I want this program to be part of the solution.\n  Transitional housing allows women to bridge the gap between leaving \nviolence in their homes and becoming self-sufficient. VAWA 2005 amends \nthe existing transitional housing program administered by the Office on \nViolence Against Women in the Department of Justice. This section \nexpands the current direct-assistance grants to include funds for \noperational, capital and renovation costs. Other changes include \nproviding services to victims of dating violence, sexual assault and \nstalking; extending the length of time for receipt of benefits to match \nthat used by Housing and Urban Development transitional housing \nprograms; and updating the existing program to reflect the concerns of \nthe service provision community. The provision would increase the \nauthorized funding for the grant from $30,000,000 to $40,000,000.\n  Now it is time to strengthen the prevention of violence against women \nand children and its devastating costs and consequences. This \nlegislation goes beyond simple words of recognition and efforts to \nincrease awareness of the problem of violence to save the lives of \nbattered women, rape victims and children who grow up with violence. I \nlook forward to working further with fellow Senators on VAWA 2005 and I \nurge the Senate to take prompt action on this legislation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the Violence Against \nWomen Act of 2005, and I commend Senator Biden, Senator Specter, and \nSenator Hatch for their bipartisan leadership on these major issues.\n  Violence against women is a very real and very serious continuing \nproblem in the United States. The statistics are shocking.\n  Every 15 seconds, somewhere in America, a woman is battered, usually \nby her intimate partner.\n  Every 90 seconds, somewhere in America, someone is sexually \nassaulted.\n  On average, three women are murdered by their husbands or boyfriends \nin America every day.\n  One out of every six American women have been the victims of a rape \nin their lifetime.\n\n[[Page S6232]]\n\n  These statistics are not just numbers. These violent acts are \nhappening to mothers, sisters, daughters, and friends. We cannot \ntolerate this violence in our communities.\n  In 1994, Congress allocated funds to initiate efforts to prevent \nviolence against women and families. The programs established under the \nViolence Against Women Act, and later expanded and reauthorized in \n2000, have worked, and so will this legislation, because it takes \nneeded additional steps to prevent such violence. It enhances law \nenforcement and judicial procedures to combat violence against women, \nand it also reinvigorates programs to help older and disabled victims \nof domestic violence.\n  Forty-four percent of the Nation's mayors identified domestic \nviolence as a primary cause of homelessness. This bill eases housing \nproblems for battered women.\n  Victims of domestic violence need time off from work to obtain \nmedical attention, counseling, and other support. This bill will \nprovide that flexibility.\n  Doctors, nurses, and other health professionals are often the first \nresponders for treating the injuries women suffer from domestic and \nsexual violence. It is essential for those who help them to be able to \nrespond effectively and compassionately. When health providers screen \nfor domestic violence and follow up on such cases, women are more \nlikely to be safer over the long term. This bill includes new funds for \ntraining health professionals to recognize and respond to domestic and \nsexual violence, and to enable public health officials to recognize the \nneed as well. The research funds provided by this bill are vital \nbecause we need the best possible interventions in health care settings \nto prevent future violence and help the victims.\n  Violence against women can occur throughout women's lives, beginning \nin childhood, continuing in adolescence, and in numerous contexts and \nsettings. It is important for any bill on such violence to focus on \ngirls and young women as well, and this bill does that.\n  In 1994, we included an important innovative provision in the bill to \nfund a National Domestic Violence Hotline. When the hotline opened in \nFebruary 1996, victims of domestic violence across the nation finally \nhad help available toll-free, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. This \nlegislation increases funding for that very important support.\n  Another important section of the bill provides greater help to \nimmigrant victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, trafficking and \nsimilar offenses. This section builds on the current Act and is \ndesigned to remove the obstacles in immigration laws that prevent such \nvictims from safely fleeing the violence in their lives, and to dispel \nthe fear that often prevents them from prosecuting their abusers.\n  Eliminating domestic violence is especially challenging in immigrant \ncommunities, where victims often face additional cultural, linguistic \nand immigration barriers to seeking safety. Abusers of immigrant \nspouses or children are liable to use threats of deportation against \nthem, trapping them in endless years of violence. Many of us have heard \nhorrific stories of violence in cases where the threat of deportation \nwas used against immigrant spouses and children--``If you leave me, \nI'll report you to the immigration authorities, and you'll never see \nthe children again.'' Or the abuser says, ``If you tell the police what \nI did, I'll have immigration deport you.''\n  Congress has made significant progress in enacting protections for \nthese immigrant victims, but there are still many women and children \nwhose lives are in danger. Our bill extends immigration relief to all \nvictims of family violence, including victims of elder abuse, incest \nand stalking. It ensures economic security for immigrant victims and \ntheir children by providing work authorization for victims with valid \nimmigration cases. It makes it easier for victims of trafficking to \nobtain federal benefits if they assist in the investigation or \nprosecution of trafficking crimes.\n  I commend the sponsors of this legislation for working with us on \nthis issue and for making domestic violence in immigrant communities an \nimportant priority in our overall effort to combat violence against \nwomen.\n  We have a responsibility in Congress to do all we can to eradicate \ndomestic violence. Our bill gives the safety of women and their \nfamilies the high priority it deserves, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. STABENOW (for herself and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 1198. A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to authorize \nStates to restrict receipt of foreign municipal solid waste, to \nimplement the Agreement Concerning the Transboundary Movement of \nHazardous Waste between the United States and Canada, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nInternational Solid Waste Importation and Management Act. I want to \nthank Senator Levin for cosponsoring this bill and for his tireless \nwork to stop Canadian trash imports into our State. The purpose of our \nbill is to finally put an end to the river of garbage flowing from \nCanada into Michigan's landfills.\n  Our legislation is a companion bill to H.R. 2491 which is being voted \non in the Subcommittee on Environment and Hazardous Material of the \nHouse Energy and Commerce Committee today. I am extremely pleased that \nCongress is starting to take action on this critical bill.\n  I cannot overstate the importance of this legislation to Michigan. \nThe number of trash trucks entering our State has continually \nincreased. In fact, since the summer of 2003 the number of trash trucks \ncoming from Canada has jumped from 180 per day to about 415 per day. \nThe result is that Michigan is the third largest importer of trash out \nof all of the States in the Nation.\n  Not only does this waste dramatically decrease Michigan's own \nlandfill capacity, but it has a tremendous negative impact on \nMichigan's environment and on the public health of its citizens. \nCanadian waste also hampers the effectiveness of Michigan's state and \nlocal recycling efforts, since Ontario does not have a bottle law \nrequiring recycling. Trash trucks also present a security risk at our \nMichigan-Canadian border, since, by their nature, trucks full of \ngarbage are harder for Customs agents to inspect then traditional \ncargo.\n  Michigan already has protections contained in an international \nagreement between the United States and Canada, but they are being \nignored. Under the Agreement Concerning the Transboundary Movement of \nHazardous Waste, which was entered into in 1986, shipments of waste \nacross the Canadian-U.S. border require government-to-government \nnotification. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as the \ndesignated authority for the United States would receive notification \nof a trash shipment and then consent or object to the shipment within \n30 days. Unfortunately, these notification provisions have never been \nenforced by the EPA.\n  This legislation will give Michigan residents the protection they are \nentitled to under this bilateral treaty. The bill would allow the State \nof Michigan to pass laws to stop the Canadian trash shipments until the \nEPA finally enforces this treaty. Once the EPA begins enforcing the \ntreaty, they would have to consider certain criteria when deciding \nwhether to consent or object to a shipment, such as the State's views \non the shipment, and the shipment's impact on landfill capacity, air \nemissions, public health, and the environment. These waste shipments \nshould no longer be accepted without an examination of the impacts on \nthe health and welfare of Michigan families.\n  Michiganians and the Michigan Congressional delegation are united in \nour opposition to Canadian trash shipments. We have waged a continuous \nbattle to end trash importation and we will continue to fight until we \nsucceed. I urge my colleagues on the Senate Environment and Public \nWorks Committee to take action on this crucial legislation as quickly \nas they can.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1198\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S6233]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

Foreign municipal solid waste''.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, every week, thousands of truckloads of \nsolid municipal waste are being imported into the United States for \ndisposal in US. landfills. Most of these shipments enter at three \nborder crossings in Michigan: Port Huron, Sault Ste. Marie, and \nDetroit. Canadian shipments are entering this country' without \nregulatory controls to protect the environment and public safety as \nrequired by a treaty between the US. and Canada. The loads of municipal \nsolid waste are more than just a nuisance. Canada's weekly importation \nof thousands of truckloads of trash into Michigan is a potential threat \nto our environment, health, and security.\n  I join with my colleague Senator Stabenow today in introducing S. \n1198, the companion to H.R. 2491, which was reported by the House \nEnergy and Commerce Subcommittee on Environment and Hazardous Waste \ntoday. It is long overdue for Congress to address this critical issue \nfor Michigan and the rest of the U.S. This bill has the support of the \nentire Michigan Congressional delegation.\n  Our legislation requires the EPA Administrator to implement \nregulations enforcing terms of the United States-Canada treaty within \n24 months, and it gives States the authority to regulate foreign waste \ntransported into the U.S. until those regulations to implement and \nenforce the treaty become effective. Our bill implements the treaty's \nrequirement that the Canadian environmental department notify the EPA \nof each shipment of waste that enters the United States. The EPA then \nhas 30 days to object to the shipment or accept it.\n  I believe this legislation will help to protect the health and \nenvironment of the people of Michigan. I am pleased to have worked on \nthis bipartisan initiative with the other members of our State's \ncongressional delegation and with Gov. Jennifer Granholm. I urge the \nmembers of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee to take \naction on this legislation as quickly as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS:\n  S. 1199. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to \nshorten the waiting period for social security disability benefits for \nindividuals with mesothelioma; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce \nlegislation that would significantly reduce the Social Security \nDisability payment waiting period for people diagnosed with the fatal \ncancer of mesothelioma.\n  Seventy to eighty percent of all documented cases of mesothelioma \nshare the common denominator of a history of asbestos. While symptoms \nof mesothelioma can remain latent over many decades, this rare cancer \nviolently attacks its victims, and drastically reduce their life \nexpectancy.\n  The Social Security Administration currently has a mandatory five-\nmonth ``waiting period'' for all people applying for disability. The \nvictims of mesothelioma simply cannot wait 5 months for their \ndisability payments to begin. This bill will significantly reduce the \nwaiting period from 5 months to 30 days for victims of mesothelioma.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this measure and join me in \nensuring these victims get their payments in a timely fashion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1199\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Prompt Disability Payment to \n     Mesothelioma Victims Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Mesothelioma is a quickly advancing form of cancer.\n       (2) Most cases of mesothelioma arise from exposure to \n     asbestos fibers.\n       (3) The National Cancer Institute estimates that in 2002, \n     approximately 2,000 new mesothelioma diagnoses were made in \n     the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3. SHORTENED WAITING PERIOD FOR SOCIAL SECURITY \n                   DISABILITY BENEFITS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH \n                   MESOTHELIOMA.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 223(c)(2) of the Social Security \n     Act (42 U.S.C. (c)(2)) is amended--\n       (1) in the matter preceding subparagraph (A), by inserting \n     ``(or, in the case of an individual with mesothelioma, 30 \n     days)'' after ``months''; and\n       (2) in subparagraph (B)--\n       (A) in clause (i), by inserting ``(or, in the case of an \n     individual with mesothelioma, the thirteenth month)'' after \n     ``seventeenth month''; and\n       (B) in clause (ii), by inserting ``(or, in the case of an \n     individual with mesothelioma, such thirteenth month)'' after \n     ``such seventeenth month''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a) \n     apply to applications for disability benefits filed or \n     pending on or after the date of enactment of this Act and to \n     any individuals with filed applications for such benefits as \n     of that date who are within a waiting period on such date.\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 1202. A bill to provide environmental assistance to non-Federal \ninterests in the State of Colorado; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, the ability of communities to provide its \ncitizens with clean, safe drinking water is one of the most important \npublic utility services any municipality can offer. I support many of \nthe goals of the Clean Water Act and believe that the United States has \nmade great progress in eliminating dangerous substances from drinking \nwater. It has helped make our national drinking water infrastructure \nmore reliable and more effective. Unfortunately, many of the small, \nfinancially strapped, rural communities in Colorado cannot meet the \nobligations of the Clean Water Act or the regulations of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency because of increasingly onerous \nunfunded Federal drinking water mandates, As a result, communities in \nmy home State are faced with two options: increase taxes and utility \nrates to exorbitant levels or end municipal water delivery. Neither \noption is acceptable.\n  That is why I am introducing the Rural Colorado Water Infrastructure \nAct, a bill that will allow Colorado to participate in a program known \nas Section 595 of the Water Resources Development Act. My legislation \nauthorizes $50 million for design and construction assistance to non-\nFederal interests in the most desperate Colorado communities for \npublicly owned water related environmental infrastructure and resource \nprotection and development projects.\n  The Rural Colorado Water Infrastructure Act will allow local \ncommunities to enter into cost share agreements with the U.S. Corps of \nEngineers to develop wastewater treatment and related facility water \nsupply, conservation and related facilities, storm water retention and \nremediation, environmental restoration, and surface water resources \nprotection and development.\n  Cities in Colorado like Alamosa, Sterling, and Julesburg that face \nenormous costs to develop new facilities may be able to utilize the \nprogram and save themselves from economic hardship. The Corps of \nEngineers Section 595 program has been a great ally to many Western \nStates, and, under my legislation, Colorado would also be able to \nbenefit from this successful public-private partnership.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1202\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Rural Colorado Water \n     Infrastructure Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to encourage students to pursue graduate education \nand to assist students in affording graduate education; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Durbin and \nStabenow to introduce GRAD, the Getting Results for Advanced Degrees \nAct. The purpose of this bill is to encourage students to pursue \ngraduate education and to assist them in affording it.\n  The percentage of individuals pursuing graduate education has \nincreased dramatically in recent decades as individuals seek the \neducation and skills needed to participate in a global economy. In the \nlast 25 years alone, graduate enrollment in the United States has \nincreased by 38 percent bringing the number of graduate students in \nthis country to 1.85 million.\n  The benefits of graduate education for our country are enormous. This \nyear's graduate and professional students are the doctors, scientists, \nand inventors of tomorrow. Their ideas and innovations will be the \nbasis of America's economic strength in the years to come. The benefits \nfor individuals are significant as well. The median earnings of a \nworker with a master's degree are twice that of a high school graduate \nand $10,000 more than an individual with a bachelor's degree. The \nmedian earnings of a worker with a doctoral degree are 2\\1/2\\ times \nthat of a high school graduate, $30,000 more than an individual with a \nbachelor's degree and $20,000 more than someone with a master's. An \nindividual with a professional degree can expect to make three times \nthe amount of a high school graduate, almost double the amount of an \nindividual with a bachelor's, $35,000 more than individuals with a \nmaster's and $15,000 more than someone with a doctoral degree. Clearly, \none's earning power increases, in some cases exponentially, with \nincreasing education.\n  Despite the immediate and long-term benefits of graduate education \nfor individuals and our Nation as a whole, graduate education is, for \nmany, financially out of reach. In 2002-03 the average graduate school \ntuition at public institutions was $4,855 and $15,279 at private \ninstitutions. The average debt reported by graduate students today is \n$45,900. For medical students it is $115,000, for dental students it is \n$122,000 and for law students it is $86,000. These are astounding \nfigures.\n  To increase access to graduate education, I have put together a \nseries of proposals that will make graduate and professional school \nmore accessible affordable for all qualified applicants, the Getting \nResults for Advanced Degrees Act. First, the GRAD Act raises the \nauthorization levels of GAANN, the Graduate Assistance in Areas of \nNational Need Program and the Jacob Javits Fellowship Program so that \nthere are more opportunities at more universities for students to \npursue advanced degrees. GAANN supports graduate study in areas of \nnational need such as chemistry, computer science, engineering, and \nphysics, while the Jacob Javits Program helps support graduate study in \nthe arts, humanities and social sciences.\n  To encourage greater participation by minority students in advanced \nprograms the GRAD Act creates the Patsy T. Mink Fellowship Program. \nNamed for former Congresswoman Patsy Mink, the first woman of Asian \ndescent and the first woman of color to serve in the U.S. Congress, \nthis program would offer assistance to underrepresented minorities \npursuing doctoral degrees. It is fitting that such a program be named \nafter Congresswoman Mink, a long-time champion for immigrants, \nminorities, women and children. I can think of no better tribute to her \nlifetime achievements than this program.\n  To help students afford the costs of graduation education, the GRAD \nAct expands the tax-exempt status of scholarships to treat reasonable \nroom-and-board allowances as part of permitted higher education \nexpenses. GRAD revises the cost of attendance calculations for \nfinancial aid for students with dependents to reflect the true cost-of-\nliving expenses for themselves and the families that they support. GRAD \nalso increases the unsubsidized Stafford loan limit for graduate and \nprofessional students from $10,000 to $12,000 so they are less likely \nto have to turn to more expensive private loans.\n  Mr. President, the Getting Results for Advanced Degrees Act will help \nstudents meet the financial challenges faced in pursuing graduate \nstudies. The act strengthens programs that support graduate students in \nareas of vital importance to our nation and makes assistance available \nto underrepresented minority students pursuing a doctoral degree. By \nhelping students to pursue and afford graduate education, the GRAD Act \nwill help individuals, families and the nation as a whole recognize and \nachieve the important benefits of graduate education.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in support of graduate education by \nsupporting this bill. By working together, I believe that the Senate \ncan act to ensure that more individuals are able to pursue graduate \neducation and assist our nation in meeting the challenges faced in a \nglobal economy. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1204\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Getting Results for Advanced \n     Degrees Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) From 1976 to 2000, graduate enrollment in the United \n     States increased 38 percent. In the fall of 2000, there were \n     1,850,000 graduate students enrolled in the United States.\n       (2) In 2003, 84 percent of graduate students in the United \n     States were citizens of the\n\n[[Page S6236]]\n\n     United States or resident aliens, and 16 percent were \n     temporary residents who were foreign or international \n     students.\n       (3) In a 2002 borrower's survey, the average debt reported \n     by graduate students was $45,900.\n       (4) In 1999-2000, 60 percent of all graduate and first-\n     professional students, and 82 percent of those enrolled full-\n     time and full-year, received some type of financial aid, \n     including grants, loans, assistantships, or work study. The \n     average amount of aid received by aided full-time, full-year \n     students was approximately $19,500 per year.\n       (5) Annual aid in the form of grants to full-time, full-\n     year recipients was awarded in larger average amounts to \n     doctoral students ($13,400) than to either master's students \n     ($7,600) or first-professional students ($6,900). First-\n     professional students took out larger loans on average \n     overall ($20,100) than did their counterparts at the master's \n     level ($14,800) and doctoral level ($14,100).\n       (6) Median annual earnings in 2003 increased with \n     educational attainment. There was a substantial earnings \n     differential from the highest to the lowest levels of \n     attainment:\n       (A) The median earnings of workers who had a master's \n     degree were almost twice those of high school graduates and \n     $10,000 more than those of individuals with a bachelor's \n     degree.\n       (B) The median earnings of workers who had a doctoral \n     degree were 2\\1/2\\ times those of high school graduates, \n     $30,000 more than those of individuals with a bachelor's \n     degree, and $20,000 more than those of individuals with a \n     master's degree.\n       (C) The median earnings of workers with a professional \n     degree were more than 3 times those of high school graduates, \n     almost double those of individuals with a bachelor's degree, \n     $35,000 more than those of individuals with a master's \n     degree, and $15,000 more than those of individuals with a \n     doctoral degree.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to require a study of the effects on disadvantaged \nindividuals of actions by utilities intended to reduce carbon dioxide \nemissions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Ratepayers \nProtection Act of 2005. This bill will ensure that the poor and elderly \nand other groups who are disproportionately harmed by rising energy \nprices are not forced to pick up the tab for utilities that incur costs \nto control carbon dioxide.\n  The science underlying the climate change theory does not justify the \nenormous expenditures mandatory climate bills would impose. Moreover, \nimplementing these climate bills would have virtually no effect on \nreducing temperatures even if climate alarmists are correct. Yet those \nin our society least able to bear the costs of these mandatory schemes \nwill be hit the hardest. With my bill, disadvantaged individuals will \nnot be saddled with these costs.\n  I understand that this bill will be referred to the Energy Committee. \nI do not plan to move this bill as stand-alone bill, however, but \ninstead to offer it as an amendment to any mandatory climate bill that \nsets caps on greenhouse gases.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1205\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Ratepayers Protection Act of \n     2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I would like to announce for the \ninformation of the Senate and the public that the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs will hold a hearing on June 16, 2005, entitled \n``Civilian Contractors Who Cheat On Their Taxes And What Should Be Done \nAbout It.'' The June 16 hearing will be the second hearing the \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations will hold on tax delinquency \nproblems with Federal contractors. On February 12, 2004, the \nSubcommittee held a hearing entitled ``DoD Contractors Who Cheat on \nTheir Taxes And What Should Be Done About It'' which examined the \nDepartment of Defense's (DoD) failure to levy contractor payments for \nunpaid taxes owed by contractors doing business with DoD and getting \npaid with taxpayers dollars. The February 2004 hearing also \ndemonstrated that the problem of tax delinquent Federal contractors may \nnot be confined to DoD. The Subcommittee requested that the Government \nAccountability Office (GAO) determine if Federal contractors at \ncivilian agencies were tax delinquent. At the June 16th hearing, the \nSubcommittee will present the results of this expanded investigation. \nAdditionally, the GAO will be releasing two reports which were \nrequested by the Subcommittee on this matter. The first report covers \nthe extent of tax debt among civilian contractors. The second report \ncovers the extent to which the Federal Government and the states have \nentered into reciprocal agreements to collect delinquent Federal or \nState taxes.\n  The Subcommittee hearing is scheduled for Thursday, June 16, 2005, at \n9:30 a.m. in Room 562 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building. For \nfurther information, please contact Raymond V. Shepherd, III, Staff \nDirector and Chief Counsel to the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, at 224-3721.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/08/senate-section/article/S6239-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6239-S6240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n               committee on environment and public works\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 163, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 163) designating June 5 through June \n     11, 2005, as ``National Hispanic Media Week,'' in honor of \n     the Hispanic Media of America.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I support this important resolution \ndesignating June 5 through June 11 as National Hispanic Media Week.\n  For nearly four centuries, Hispanic publishers, writers, and editors \nhave made immeasurable contributions towards our national commitment to \npromote free speech and the free exchange of ideas. This group of hard \nworking Americans has dedicated themselves to better informing our \ncommunities on the great political, economic, and social issues of the \nday. Hispanic publications serve a population of over 20 million people \nmeaning that one in every eight Americans receives at least part of \ntheir news from a Hispanic media outlet\n  The designation of a week to honor the Hispanic media of America will \nhelp affirm the importance of freedom of speech, civic engagement, and \nfurther development of the Hispanic media. This recognition of the \nHispanic media will serve as a reminder of the valuable contributions \nmade by Hispanic publishers, journalists and editors.\n  This resolution is important across the country, but I can personally \nspeak to its importance in my home State of New Mexico. Forty-two \npercent of New Mexico's population is Hispanic. I know that many of \nthose individuals rely on Hispanic media for news and entertainment. \nThey tap into such New Mexico outlets as El Hispano newspaper, radio \nstations like KDCE in Espanola and KLVO in Albuquerque, Spanish-\nlanguage television stations\n\n[[Page S6241]]\n\nlike KLUZ, and magazines like La Herencia. I am proud to be apart of \nhonoring a group that is so important to so many people in my home \nState.\n  This resolution calls on the American people to join with all \nchildren, families, organizations, communities, churches, cities, and \nStates across the Nation to observe the week with appropriate \nceremonies and activities.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to join us in promptly passing this \nresolution designating June 5 through June 11 as National Hispanic \nMedia Week.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to add my name as a \ncosponsor of this resolution to recognize Hispanic Media Week. The \nresolution provides an opportunity to recognize the vital contribution \nthe Hispanic media makes not only to the Hispanic community but to the \nNation at large.\n  As the Hispanic community grows in numbers, business influence, and \npolitical power an integral part of their success has been the Hispanic \nmedia. Currently there are almost 600 Hispanic publishers in the United \nStates with a combined readership of over 30 million. These \npublications represent Spanish, bilingual, and English daily, weekly, \nand periodic newspapers and magazines. Many of these publishers have \npersevered through years and even decades of low circulation numbers \nand industrywide skepticism to emerge today as a dynamic and growing \nsegment of the publishing industry.\n  The number of Hispanic publishers continues to grow larger and play \nan important role in getting vital information to this important \nsegment of the population. In disseminating vital information to the \nHispanic community, Hispanic publishers have performed a service not \nonly to their own communities but to each and every community that \nstrives towards a free and open exchange of ideas in the embodiment of \nthe American dream.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 163) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 163\n\n       Whereas for almost 470 years the United States has \n     benefitted from the work of Hispanic writers and publishers;\n       Whereas over 600 Hispanic publications circulate over \n     20,000,000 copies every week in the United States;\n       Whereas 1 in 8 Americans is served by a Hispanic \n     publication;\n       Whereas the Hispanic press informs many Americans about \n     great political, economic, and social issues of our day;\n       Whereas the Hispanic press in the United States focuses in \n     particular on informing and promoting the well being of our \n     country's Hispanic community; and\n       Whereas commemorating the achievements of the Hispanic \n     press acknowledges the important role the Hispanic press has \n     played in United States history: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 5 through June 11, 2005, as ``National \n     Hispanic Media Week'', in honor of the Hispanic Media of \n     America; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the week with appropriate programs and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/08/senate-section/article/S6241-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS 138TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

At 4 p.m., the Senate \nwill proceed to a vote on confirmation.
