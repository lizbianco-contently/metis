Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, tomorrow, July 26, marks the 15th \nanniversary of the signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act. \nObservances and celebrations are being held and will be held all across \nthe country. In fact, I attended three in Iowa over the weekend. There \nwill be a big celebration tonight at the Kennedy Center where I look \nforward to introducing former President George Bush, the signer of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, who will give the keynote address.\n  On this 15th anniversary, we celebrate one of the great landmark \ncivil rights laws of the 20th century, a long overdue emancipation \nproclamation for people with disabilities. We also celebrate the men \nand women from all across America whose daily acts of heroism and \nprotest and persistence and courage moved this law forward to passage \n15 years ago.\n  In 1964, this country passed a civil rights bill. After much \nstruggle, after the freedom riders and the marches in places such as \nSelma, AL, that are burned in our memories, we passed the Civil Rights \nAct of 1964 which closed a long, disgraceful chapter of segregation and \ndiscrimination, lack of equality of opportunity for Americans just \nbased on race, mostly, sex, creed, and national origin.\n  I can remember coming home on leave from the military some time after \nthat. I was with my brother Frank who had been totally deaf since early \nchildhood. I had seen how he had been discriminated against all of his\n\n[[Page S8768]]\n\nlifetime. I remember we were talking about different things, and he \nmentioned the civil rights bill. He thought it was all well and good. \nBut then he asked the question: What about us? I didn't really know \nwhat he was talking about.\n  I said: Are you talking about us, me?\n  He said: What about us deaf people? We are discriminated against \nevery day in terms of where we can work, can go, how we get news, how \nwe go to school.\n  I began to think about it as I finished my career in the military and \nthrough law school and coming here to Congress. I thought, as I watched \nthe struggle of people with disabilities to proclaim their involvement, \nthat they should also be covered by the Civil Rights Act. So there were \nsome minor steps taken. We had section 504 of the Rehab Act in 1973 \nbefore I got here. Then after coming to the House in 1974, we had the \nEducation of Handicapped Children Act, 94-142, which my good friend, \nnow Senator Jeffords, then Congressman Jeffords, was very much involved \nin getting passed in the House at that time. It later became known as \nIDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. That is how it \nis known today.\n  Then there began a long struggle by people with disabilities to gain \ntheir full participation in our society.\n  This started in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Then when I came to \nthe Senate in 1984, 1985, it had been picking up steam and momentum. \nVarious drafts of bills have been presented about disability and this \nand that.\n  Finally, it fell to me as chairman of the Disability Policy \nSubcommittee at that time to pull together the final draft. Here I will \npay my great respect and admiration to former Senator Lowell Weicker of \nConnecticut, who led the charge before I got here to change the law to \nprovide for an overarching law to cover people with disabilities in our \ncountry. But then Senator Kennedy asked me to join his committee and \ntake over the chairmanship of the disability subcommittee, which I did, \nwith the great help of wonderful staff, including Bobby Silverstein and \nothers. We were able to get the words on paper, put it together. It was \na pretty long struggle.\n  It was not a foregone conclusion that we could ever pass it. But \nthere were acts of heroism. I can remember when people with \ndisabilities started coming to Washington to protest. Sometimes they \nwould plug the corridors in the Dirksen Office Building, and the police \nwould have to clear them out. Many got arrested. I remember a man named \nDwayne French, who came from Alaska to demonstrate, protest, and demand \nequal rights under the law. He got arrested and thrown into jail.\n  I tend to think the one thing that really crystalized what we were \ntrying to do in terms of full participation, accessibility, of \nnondiscrimination and breaking down barriers--the one event was when \nBob Kofka and the group ADAP rolled their wheelchairs up to the Capitol \nsteps, and there were about between 50 and 75 people. I don't know the \nexact number. They got out of their wheelchairs and crawled up the \nsteps of the Capitol; they crawled up the steps. That hit the evening \nnews, all the newspapers, and the news magazines, and then we heard \nfrom the American public that this should not be allowed to happen, \nthat people with disabilities ought to have accessibility; they ought \nto be able to participate in all aspects of our American life. And then \nwe hammered out the bill and got it passed in the Senate and the House.\n  As I said, on July 26, 1990, in a wonderful ceremony, the biggest \ngathering for the signing of a bill in our Nation's history, people \ngathered on the lawn of the White House for the signing of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act by President George Bush. It was a \ngreat and joyous occasion.\n  For all these years, after 1964, we thought we had torn down the \nwalls of segregation. But there was a group of Americans for whom \nsegregation was a daily occurrence, even after the Civil Rights Act, \nfor whom daily discrimination was a fact of life, for whom equal \nopportunity was just some words on paper. There was a group of \nAmericans for whom access to the American dream was basically closed \nbecause of their lack of participation in economic opportunity and \naccessibility. These were Americans with disabilities.\n  I often put it this way: On July 25, 1990, if you were a person of \ncolor, say, and you went down to apply for a job for which you were \nqualified and the prospective employer looked at you and said, I am not \nhiring African Americans, or Black people, or probably, in the \ncontextual framework of that time, I am not hiring colored people, if \nhe said that to you, you could have gone right down to the courthouse. \nThe doors were open there, and you could have filed suit for \ndiscrimination based on the Civil Rights Act of 1964. If, however, on \nJuly 25, 1990, you were a person with a disability and you went to a \nprospective employer for a job for which you were qualified--say you \nrode a wheelchair in there and the employer looked at you and said, We \ndon't hire cripples, get out of here, and you rolled your wheelchair \ndown to the same courthouse door. The doors were locked; they were \nclosed. You had no cause of action. It was not illegal to discriminate \non the basis of disability on July 25, 1990. On July 26, after \nPresident Bush signed it into law, the courthouse doors were opened. No \nlonger would it be legal to discriminate on the basis of disability in \nour society.\n  So for the last 15 years, we have seen what I call a quiet revolution \ntaking place in America. Look around you. You see the curb cuts, ramps, \nwidened doors, elevators that are accessible, and people with \ndisabilities can get on and off buses. I was in Iowa this weekend and \nwent to an ATM machine to get some money, and the ATM machine is a \ntalking one with brail so that a blind person can use the ATM machine. \nSo we now see people with seeing-eye dogs going into restaurants to \nhave a meal. Fifteen years ago, a restaurant could say, Get that dog \nout of here, we don't allow it. Now they have to allow it.\n  Now we see people with disabilities working jobs, traveling, enjoying \nlife, going to movies. Yesterday, I went to a Cedar Rapids Colonels \nbaseball game. It was disability day. They have a new baseball stadium \nthere; it is 4 years old. It is one of the most accessible stadiums I \nhave ever seen in my life. All kinds of people with disabilities can \ncome there and enjoy baseball games. That would not have been true \nbefore. The old diamond had one place set aside down on the first base \nline with people walking in front of them all the time. Now they are up \nhigh, and they have great seats in this stadium. So we see this all \naround us.\n\n  For those of us who are able-bodied, we kind of take it for granted. \nIt is not a big deal out there that you have curb cuts or access to \nbuildings. I walked into a hotel downtown a week or so ago, where the \nNational Commission on Independent Living, NCIL, was having their \nnational meeting. Four or five people with disabilities coming into the \nHyatt pushed a button at the door, and they could get their wheelchairs \nin and out. We don't even think about that. So it is a quiet \nrevolution.\n  My nephew, who is an architect, told me a few years ago that now we \nare designing buildings the way they should be designed--fully \naccessible to all. We also have closed captioning on television for the \ndeaf and hard of hearing. We can pick up our remote for the TV and \npunch the mute and see the words come up, and we take it for granted. \nBut it has transformed lives in America. It has made us a better, \nricher, more fair society. Now the American family is much more \ncomplete than it was before.\n  So on this, the 15th anniversary, I say thank you to the disabled \ncommunity of America for their long years of struggle and protest, for \nthe hardships they went through just to make sure they were treated \nequally in our society. I always point out that in the ADA, there is \nnot one nickel given to a person with a disability. It is not any kind \nof giveaway program. All it does is break down the barriers. People \nwith disabilities now can apply their God-given talents and their \nabilities and contribute to our society. So it is quite a step forward \nfor America. We have a lot to be proud of and a lot to be thankful for. \nBut I must say that we are not totally to where we wanted to be.\n  We had four goals when we passed the ADA. One was economic self-\nsufficiency. Fifteen years later, over 60 percent of Americans with \ndisabilities are still unemployed, without a job. That is still a \nnational disgrace. So I hope we use this occasion of this 15th \nanniversary, yes, to look at the great\n\n[[Page S8769]]\n\nstrides we have made and how far we have come but also to recommit \nourselves to make the ADA really complete. We have to do more in terms \nof job training, personal assistance services, and accessibility so \nthat people with disabilities can have more jobs. Sixty percent \nunemployment is not right. So I hope we will redouble our commitment to \ngetting this next step passed.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Vermont be given 10 minutes to make his statement at this point.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, tomorrow marks a milestone for the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, ADA. July 26 is the 15th anniversary \nof the ADA's enactment into law.\n  The ADA is one of the most significant initiatives to become law \nduring my 30 years in the Congress.\n  As a Member of the House I was an original cosponsor the first time \nthe ADA bill was introduced in 1988.\n  Although ADA did not pass during that Congress, action on the ADA \nlegislation would not have to wait much longer.\n  Under the extraordinary citizen leadership of the late Justin Dart, \nformer Representative Tony Coehlo, Representative Steny Hoyer, former \nSenate Majority Leader Bob Dole, my colleague Senator Tom Harkin, and \nthen President George H.W. Bush, the ADA became law in 1990.\n  Another important factor that led to the passage of the ADA was the \nstaunch commitment of many diverse organizations.\n  The ADA is an excellent illustration as to how bipartisanship, \ncombined with the outstanding efforts of our Nation's citizenry, can \nlead to a landmark change that can positively impact people's lives for \ncenturies to come.\n  The ADA has literally opened doors that were closed prior to 1990, \nwhich has reaped great benefits for all of us.\n  In 1990, the largest Vermont employment agency successfully placed \n505 disabled individuals with employers. As of last year, that \nsuccessful placement rate had increased almost threefold.\n  Individual and economic empowerment is the ongoing legacy of the ADA.\n  Although many great transformations have occurred since ADA's birth \n15 years ago, there is room for improvement.\n  The ADA needs to be protected and its spirit of inclusion and \nopportunity should be extended.\n  I thank Senator Harkin for bringing the ADA birthday resolution to \nthe full Senate. I am proud to join him in wishing the ADA a very happy \nbirthday.\n  Mr. President, I hope we have others come to speak who are as excited \nas I am.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, in Oregon it is estimated that there are \n433,000 people living with disabilities, and I am pleased to be here \ntoday to represent them by recognizing and honoring the 15th \nanniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  The Americans with Disabilities Act will turn 15 years old tomorrow. \nThis act stands as one of the most successful civil rights laws in our \nhistory. This law has opened the doors of schools, polling places, and \ncountless other public facilities to our Nation's disabled population. \nThe law is and will continue to be the platform for millions of \nAmericans to realize our Nation's goals of equality of opportunity, \neconomic self-sufficiency, full participation, and independent living.\n  Fifteen years ago it was often a dream for the 54 million Americans \nwith disabilities to participate in our Nation's daily life. However, \nthe ADA helped these people by removing barriers in employment, \ntransportation, public services, telecommunications, and public \naccommodations. The act stands as a tribute to the hard work of all of \nthe individuals who brought light to the plight of the disabled before \nand after this legislation was passed.\n  For years, people with disabilities were viewed as people in need of \nhelp rather than contributors to our country. The passage of the ADA \nfinally moved us to change our attitudes and open doors for people with \ndisabilities.\n  In Oregon one of the people who has been truly touched by this act is \nVail B. Horton. Vail is the founder and CEO of a company called Keen \nMobility. Using his disability as motivation, Vail created his company, \nKeen Mobility, which develops, produces, and distributes innovative, \nfunctional and attractive assistive devices that empower individuals by \nenhancing mobility, bringing greater independence and providing new \nopportunities.\n  Vail is also a board member for Providence Child Center for the \nMedically Fragile Children Foundation and Board member for YMCA of \nColumbia-Willamette. I have personally recognized him as an Oregon \nhealth care hero. As founder and CEO of Keen Mobility, Vail built the \ncompany from inception into a team of 16, with three product lines \nfocused on safety and mobility for the disability community.\n  Vail is a true hero and I am happy to say that the 250,000 families \nwith members who have a disability in Oregon, like his, can see the \nmany signs of our progress. However, we must continue our ongoing \nefforts to see that persons with disabilities are allowed to be active \nin our society. Whether they are friends, neighbors or family, persons \nwith disabilities are no longer considered second class citizens. Every \nday persons with disabilities are demonstrating their abilities and \nmaking real contributions. People with disabilities are no longer \nexcluded, and because of that America is a stronger country.\n  Tomorrow we should all be reminded that equal opportunity is not a \nprivilege, but a fundamental right of every American.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this resolution.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, 15 years ago a Democratic Congress and a \nRepublican President passed the Americans with Disabilities Act, a \ncritical step in our journey toward civil rights for all.\n  The ADA represented Washington at its best--both parties coming \ntogether, ignoring the special interests, and passing groundbreaking \nlegislation to help people in dire need. Differences were set aside as \nwe united in common respect for all Americans, regardless of physical, \ncognitive, or emotional abilities. We made a strong statement of our \ncollective belief that in America, all citizens have the right to look \nat the future with infinite possibility. And I think we can all agree \nthe ADA has been a remarkable success.\n  On this anniversary, I think it is appropriate to recognize those \nleaders who took the momentum from decades of struggle that had only \nled to small legislative advances, and turned it into one of the \ncrowning achievements in civil rights law. My distinguished colleagues \nSenators Harkin and Kennedy, my former colleague Senator Dole and \nformer President Bush, and organizations like DREDF, CCD, NICL and \nADAPT, among others, showed such incredible leadership. And we would \nnot have gotten anywhere if the members of the disabilities community \nhad not set all disparate opinions aside to speak with one voice.\n  Fifteen years after passage of the ADA, we find that the challenge of \nhigh unemployment, poverty, poor housing, and limited educational \nopportunities still plagues people with disabilities in America. If \nshould not be this way. I hope that all of us, who 15 years ago \nbelieved that to exclude persons with disabilities from our schools, \nrestaurants, or job force was un-American, are reminded as we celebrate \nthis anniversary that there is still much work left to be done.\n  Today, we must go beyond congratulating all the pioneers in this \nmovement for this extraordinarily special anniversary. We must also \nreaffirm that the Congress stands ready to be the leading force in \nprotecting and strengthening this law--never undermining it. Let us all \ncommit to redoubling our efforts to serve this important community and \nthis crucial cause.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in commemorating the \n15th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. I thank my \nfriend from Iowa, Senator Harkin, for sponsoring a resolution \nrecounting the history and accomplishments under this landmark act for \ncountless individuals in the United States. I am pleased to be a \ncosponsor of this resolution.\n  The enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, on July \n26,\n\n[[Page S8770]]\n\n1990, was a milestone and continues to serve the more than 54 million \nindividuals with disabilities in our country today. These individuals \nare now able to better participate in society thanks to the removal of \nbarriers in areas such as employment, transportation, public services, \ntelecommunications, and public accommodations under the ADA. Prior to \nthe passage of the act, it was much more common for disabled Americans \nto encounter prejudice, discrimination, and physical exclusion in their \neveryday lives. The Americans with Disabilities Act marks the \nculmination of a civil rights movement that keeps faith with the spirit \nof our forefathers, who believed in the unalienable rights of all \nindividuals.\n  Under the ADA, my home State has become a leader in providing new and \nupdated facilities for individuals with disabilities. An estimated \n148,000 people in Hawaii are living with a disability, and an estimated \n22,000 people have difficulty performing self-care activities, such as \ndressing, bathing, or mobility inside the home according to the 2003 \nAmerican Community Survey.\n  Since the passage of the ADA, Hawaii has modified more than 5,000 \ncurb ramps and built 3,000 new curb ramps for better accessibility \nthroughout the State. No one should be denied access to buses, \nsidewalks, or parks, and I am pleased to say that Hawaii is one of the \nleaders in ensuring that everyone has an equal opportunity to \nparticipate in society. By next year, Hawaii's public sector will be \nalmost 100-percent accessible and, as of today, 70 percent of the \nprivate sector has addressed or is addressing the needs of the \ndisabled, according to a nationally recognized ADA consultant.\n  I join the more than 40 million disabled Americans who have been \nhelped by the ADA in saying mahalo to those who championed this \nhistoric piece of legislation. In particular, the tireless efforts of \nJustin Dart, Jr. His courage and dedication as a disability rights \nadvocate is exemplary in protecting the civil rights of disabled \nAmericans. Mr. Dart has inspired future generations of disabled \nAmericans to reach their full potential as active and engaged members \nof society.\n  The work of my fellow Senators Harkin and Kennedy in the Senate, as \nwell as Representative Hoyer in the House, must also be recognized in \naddition to everyone else who pushed for this legislation. It was my \ngreat privilege to vote in favor of the conference report when it \npassed in the Senate on July 13, 1990. Our collaborative work in \nCongress to push the ADA through to passage showed a strong commitment \nto civil rights and equality. Millions of Americans are forever \ngrateful for the chance they now have to live a better life.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the 15th \nanniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of this landmark legislation which guarantees equal \nopportunity for people with disabilities in employment, transportation, \npublic services, telecommunications, and public accommodations.\n  Over the past 15 years, the ADA has provided opportunity and access \nfor the 54 million Americans with disabilities. The passage of ADA \nresulted from a long struggle by Americans with disabilities to bring \nan end to their inferior status and unequal protection under law. Prior \nto passage of this landmark civil rights legislation, these Americans \nroutinely faced prejudice, discrimination, and exclusion--not to \nmention physical barriers in their everyday lives. Now these Americans \nhave an opportunity to participate more fully in our national life.\n  We recognize, however, our work is not finished. We still need to do \nmore for people with disabilities. In addition to removing the physical \nbarriers, we must also change attitudes. People with disabilities--like \nall people--have unique abilities, talents, and aptitudes. And America \nis better, fairer, and richer when we make full use of those gifts.\n  As we celebrate this historic accomplishment, I encourage all \nAmericans to work towards increased recognition and understanding of \nthe manner in which the physical and social environment can pose \ndiscriminatory barriers to people with disabilities.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 15th \nanniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. On this day in \n1990, President George H.W. Bush signed this monumental piece of \nlegislation into law guaranteeing equal opportunity for people with \ndisabilities in public accommodations, commercial facilities, \nemployment, transportation, State and local government services, and \ntelecommunications.\n  One out of every five Americans today suffers from a disability. In \nthe national workforce, there are currently 4 million men and 3\\1/2\\ \nmillion women with disabilities employed. We have made noteworthy \nstrides in granting equal rights to those with disabilities. However, \nwe still have tremendous work to do to decrease the 70 percent \nunemployment rate for people with significant disabilities.\n  In my own State of Louisiana, 710,000 people over the age of 5 were \nreported to have a disability. This means that 14.8 percent of the \npopulation in Louisiana suffers from some form of disability.\n  There are thousands of stories that capture the significance of this \nmeasure to people around this country, but I want to highlight just \none. Shirley Adams is a constituent of mine, and she typifies the \nimpact that the ADA can have on a person's life.\n  Shirley's road to inclusion into her community was long and filled \nwith obstacles. She is a woman with many labels--profound mental \nretardation, visual impairment, a history of seizures, a rare bone \nailment, and nonverbal. However, with great determination and courage, \nShirley has established a life full of meaning surrounded by people who \nlove and care for her. She would have it no other way.\n  At age 3, Shirley moved to Pinecrest Developmental Center in central \nLouisiana. She received care while living at Pinecrest, but she never \nlearned to take care of herself. In 1997, at age 31, Shirley received \nan MR/DD waiver which enabled her to move from Pinecrest into her own \napartment in the New Orleans area where she continues to receive 24-\nhour support.\n  Shirley is now able to attend church where she has made lifelong \nfriends. In addition, she volunteers at another church where she \nassists staff in passing out lunches to children enrolled in vacation \nBible study, sending mail out to parishioners, and welcoming people to \nthe services each Sunday. She helps her neighborhood association by \nwatering the flowers to the entrance to her apartment complex on a \nregular basis.\n  Living on her own has enabled Shirley to travel, which is something \nthat she was unable to do while living in an institution. She loves to \nvacation in Biloxi and on the beaches of Florida. She is constantly \nlooking for new places to go and for new adventures. If Shirley has it \nher way, she will continue to soak up the Sun on the gulf coast and \nexplore new frontiers for years to come.\n  In sum, Shirley is known and loved by hundreds in her community now. \nShe has a sense of belonging and security that she has never \nexperienced before. Her life is full of people who care for her, and \nshe continues to make wonderful progress in living in her own home to \nthis day. Shirley Adams is clearly an inspiration to anyone who wants \nto explore their surroundings and lead a very happy life surrounded by \nloved ones in their community.\n  Shirley and thousands of others in Louisiana now live a full and \ncomplete life. The ADA gives people with disabilities such as Shirley a \nvehicle to request and secure the accommodations they need for both \nphysical and programmatic access to life in Louisiana.\n  In 1990, when the ADA was passed, Louisiana spent nothing on home and \ncommunity-based services for people with disabilities such as Shirley. \nIn 2003 alone, Louisiana spent $157,447,900. These services, inspired \nby the spirit of equality established by the ADA, allow thousands of \nLouisiana's citizens with disabilities the opportunity to live their \nlives as contributing, participating members of our society.\n  In addition, there are now 3,170 aging or elderly individuals \nreceiving home and community-based services that allow them to remain \nin their own homes.\n  The ADA impacts the daily lives of my constituents living with \ndisabilities and for that reason I want to applaud the honorable work \nbeing done due to the enactment of this legislation while not losing \nsight of the fact that we\n\n[[Page S8771]]\n\nmust work harder to help all disabled persons have equal civil rights \nand the job opportunities they deserve.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I express support for the Senate resolution \nhonoring the 15th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. \nThis piece of legislation is a celebration of the uniquely American \nnotion that all of our citizens can contribute to society if we provide \nthem with the tools and opportunities they need. Since the law was \nenacted in 1990, some 54 million disabled Americans have had better \nopportunities for employment and education. Our public spaces and \ntransportation systems have been improved to ensure access to everyone. \nThe Americans with Disabilities Act gives all people the opportunity to \nenjoy what American society has to offer, and it has changed public \nattitudes. The perception of helplessness and dependency has been \nlargely replaced by a recognition that, with the aid of appropriate \naccommodations, disabled Americans can participate fully in all fields \nof civic life.\n  In commending all those involved in the passage of this legislation, \nwe should take time to single out then Senate Majority leader Bob Dole. \nSenator Dole's sacrifice for his country and service in the Congress \nprove that disability need not be debilitating.\n  I admire the courage and perseverance of the millions of Americans \nwho live with disabilities every day. This resolution celebrates not \nonly the passage of the ADA, but also the positive contributions that \nall Americans make to our society.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise, in support of S. Res. 207, the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act resolution commemorating the 15th \nanniversary of the signing of the law.\n  As one of the original authors of the Americans with Disabilities, \nADA, I am a proud cosponsor of this important resolution. I am pleased \nthat the Senate took the time today to remember the passage of landmark \nlegislation which changed the lives of disabled individuals across the \ncountry. I am also pleased to stand with my colleague, Senator Harkin, \nwho did so much to advance this legislation in 1990, and indeed, to \nnurture its implementation ever since.\n  When this legislation was being debated on the Senate floor back in \n1990, I told my colleagues that I believed that the Americans with \nDisabilities Act would be good for all America. And 15 years later, I \nfeel the same way.\n  The Americans with Disabilities Act has done so much for the disabled \ncommunity throughout our country--due to this law, the lives of \ndisabled individuals have improved dramatically.\n  When Congress passed the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990, we \nknew that this bill would make a difference. As a result of the passage \nof this bill, valuable resources were dedicated to improving the lives \nof the disabled through employment, in public accommodations, in \ntransportation, and in communications services.\n  I credit the passage of this legislation to the millions of disabled \nAmericans, all of whom benefit from the ADA. It was their dedication, \ndetermination and courage that made the difference. They took the time \nto educate their members of Congress about why the Americans With \nDisabilities Act was necessary. And they made a convincing case to many \nof us. That dedication is why we are celebrating the 15th anniversary \nof the passage of this law today.\n  In Utah, I have a disabilities advisory committee that keeps me \nabreast of all issues of interest to the disability community. I must \npay great tribute to the members of this committee as well, for it is \ntheir insights that have helped me to reach a better understanding of \nthe partnership our Government must undertake to promote initiatives \nbenefitting the disabled.\n  I am pleased to be a supporter of the resolution before the Senate \ntoday and urge colleagues to support the passage of this resolution.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, earlier this month, America celebrated the \n41st anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Next month, we will \ncelebrate the 40th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, one of the \nmost important civil rights victories in our Nation's history. Those \nare two of the most important achievements in civil rights in our \nNation since the ratification of the Bill of Rights. Today, I want to \nreflect for a few minutes on another critically important achievement \nin civil rights: the enactment 15 years ago this week of the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act.\n  I recently saw a young man wearing a T-shirt. In large letters on the \nfront of his shirt were the words: ``The ADA . . .'' On the back, the \nshirt read, ``. . . boldly going where everyone else has already \nbeen.'' I think that young man's T-shirt sums up the ADA pretty well.\n  The Americans with Disabilities Act does not grant people with \ndisabilities any special status or position. To the contrary, it simply \nremoves certain barriers that for too long had made it difficult--if \nnot impossible--for people with disabilities to make the most of their \nGod-given skills and abilities, and to participate fully in their \ncommunities and in the workplace.\n  Before the ADA, if you needed a haircut, if you needed to see a \ndoctor, if you just wanted to meet a friend for a cup of coffee, you \nprobably had to rely on family, friends, or a social service agency. \nVery few transit systems in this country had buses or trains that were \naccessible to people using wheelchairs. Today, thanks to the ADA, that \nhas changed. If you need go somewhere, you can go to a comer, catch a \nbus, and be on your way.\n  Let me tell you another story about the difference the ADA has made. \nAnn Ford lives near my hometown, Springfield, IL. She is a grandmother \nnow. She had polio as a child. She uses a motorized scooter now, but \nfor many years, Ann walked with crutches. As anyone who has ever used \ncrutches knows, they can wear you out pretty quickly.\n  Before the ADA, when Ann Ford needed to go to the grocery store, she \nwould first make a very careful list, then plot out her shopping as \nefficiently as possible so that she could buy what she needed in 20 \nminutes and be back home before she ran out of energy.\n  Shortly after the ADA was enacted, the manager of the grocery store \nwhere she shopped pointed out a new electric-powered scooter the store \nhad purchased, and asked Ann if she would like to use it. Well, Ann \nFord shopped for an hour and half that day. She went up and down every \naisle in that store. She said later she had no idea how many things you \ncould buy in a grocery store.\n  By removing physical barriers, the ADA is helping to reduce some of \nthe isolation and prejudice that people with disabilities too often \nhave to battle. It provides people with disabilities a degree of \nautonomy and dignity that everyone deserves. That is progress, and that \nis worth celebrating.\n\n  But we still have a long way to go. The physical barriers are \ndisappearing, but there are other, subtler barriers that continue to \nprevent far too many Americans with disabilities from participating \nfully in their communities and in the workplace.\n  As Senator Harkin noted, the unemployment rate for people with \ndisabilities is still 60 to 70 percent--the same place it was a decade \nago. That has to change. Most people with disabilities want to work, \nand have to work. ADA mandates access but we can't legislate attitudes. \nAnd it is the lingering prejudice or ignorance about disabilities that \ncontributes to this stubbornly high unemployment rate.\n  Congress can mandate access. With the stroke of his pan, the \nPresident can outlaw overt acts of discrimination. But the next step in \nthis civil rights struggle--integrating people with disabilities into \nour workplaces--is a step we must choose.\n  Failure to make the greatest possible use of the skills and talents \nof people with disabilities hurts them. It hurts their families. It \nhurts all of us. Think for a moment. Where would America be today had \nwe not had Franklin Delano Roosevelt to help pull us through the Great \nDepression? Dorothea Lange, the great photojournalist, walked with a \nlimp as a result of childhood polio. How much less we might know about \nour own national history had she not captured it on film for us? How \nmuch poorer would the world be without the brilliant insights of \nStephen Hawking? How much poorer we would all be artistically and \nemotionally if we had never heard Ray Charles sing ``America the \nBeautiful?''\n  We need to tear down the subtler barriers that prevent far too many \npeople\n\n[[Page S8772]]\n\nwith disabilities from participating fully in our economy. Not just \nbecause it is the right thing to do, but because it is the smart thing \nto do.\n  I want to make one final point. I mentioned that the Americans with \nDisabilities Act is part of a tradition of important civil rights \nachievements. But there is one fundamental way in which the ADA differs \nfrom some of those other milestone laws.\n  The Civil Rights Act was enacted primarily to combat legal, \ninstitutionalized racism against African Americans. Title IX of the \neducation amendments of 1972 was passed to prevent discrimination \nagainst women and girls in education. Those laws and others protect \npeople from discrimination based on certain fundamental, unchangeable \ncharacteristics. If you are not born black, you are not going to become \nblack. But any of us can become disabled--in an instant.\n  Today, you may think the ADA is for other people and other families, \nbut you may think differently by the time we celebrate the 16th \nanniversary of the ADA a year from now. In fact, one in three 20-year-\nolds today will become disabled before the reach retirement age.\n  This past year, I have had the privilege of getting to know an \nextraordinary American who became disabled doing her job. Her name is \nTammy Duckworth. She is major in the U.S. Army National Guard. Her job \nwas piloting a Black Hawk helicopter in Iraq. Last November, just \nbefore Thanksgiving, her Black Hawk was shot down by a rocket-propelled \ngrenade and she lost both of her legs. Although now a double amputee, \nshe is determined to both walk and fly helicopters again.\n  Thanks to advances in medicine, we are able to save more people who--\n15 years ago--would not have survived a car crash, or bone cancer, or \neven military combat. Thank goodness for that.\n  As we celebrate the 15th anniversary of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, I hope we will commit ourselves as a Nation to work \nto close the gap between our medical abilities, and our mental \nattitudes. Let us agree that men and women like Tammy Duckworth, who \nsuffered permanent disabilities, will not be forced to fight in this \ncountry for basic rights and gainful employment that is worthy of their \nskills and talents. Let us commit to work across party lines--as \nCongress did when it passed the Americans with Disabilities Act 15 \nyears ago--to fulfill not just the letter but the spirit of this \nimportant law.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendments now be set aside.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before my distinguished colleague leaves \nthe floor, she had the courtesy, as she always does, to show me the \namendments. One of them relates to BRAC. The distinguished Senator from \nSouth Dakota offered a BRAC amendment the other night. I glanced at \nthis one. It seems to be similar in form, but I have not had a chance \nto examine it.\n  The purpose of my colloquy with the Senator would be to encourage \nSenators who are concerned about the important issues on BRAC to take \nnote that we had an extensive colloquy between myself and the \ndistinguished Senator from South Dakota, with the Senator from \nMichigan, the ranking member joining in, the other evening on the \nsubject. I hope that other Senators who may be cosponsors or otherwise \ninterested in this issue will find the opportunity to examine the \noriginal amendment and this amendment and that we hopefully today can \nhave a continuation of this important debate on the issues relating to \nBRAC which are of great concern to a number of colleagues.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I would accept the comments of the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee. This is a very important issue \nto many of us. I understand the chairman and the ranking member did \ndebate this issue at some length last week. I am sure the chairman is \ncorrect in saying we would all benefit from reading that colloquy as we \nprepare to debate these issues further and ultimately cast our votes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague. I do bring to the \nattention of colleagues that today is a\n\n[[Page S8774]]\n\ngood opportunity for debate such that we can have a vote on it as \nquickly as the proposers and others think it is appropriate.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMINT). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1492\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I call up an amendment that Senator Levin \nhas offered, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed], for Mr. Levin, \n     for himself, and Mr. Reed proposes an amendment numbered \n     1492.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To make available, with an offset, an additional $50,000,000 \n    for Operation and Maintenance for Cooperative Threat Reduction)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 330. ADDITIONAL AMOUNT FOR COOPERATIVE THREAT REDUCTION \n                   PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Increased Amount for Operation and Maintenance, \n     Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs.--The amount authorized \n     to be appropriated by section 301(19) for the Cooperative \n     Threat Reduction programs is hereby increased by $50,000,000.\n       (b) Offset.--Of the amount authorized to be appropriated by \n     section 201(4) for research, development, test, and \n     evaluation, Defense-wide activities, is hereby reduced by \n     $50,000,000, with the amount of the reduction to be allocated \n     as follows:\n       (1) The amount available in Program Element 0603882C for \n     long lead procurement of Ground-Based Interceptors is hereby \n     reduced by $30,000,000.\n       (2) The amount available for initial construction of \n     associated silos is hereby reduced by $20,000,000.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this amendment was offered by Senator Levin \nand myself would do several very critical and important things. First, \nthe amendment would increase funding for the Cooperative Threat \nReduction Program by $50 million. The offset would be twofold: $30 \nmillion would be taken from the long lead procurement of ground-based \ninterceptors as part of the National Missile Defense Program and \nanother $20 million would be taken from the funding for initial \nconstruction for silos to house these interceptors.\n  Essentially what Senator Levin is doing with this provision is to \nrecognize the fact that a more immediate threat to the United States \nrests with literally thousands of locations where nuclear material \nmight be housed from the breakup of the old Soviet Union, and other \nlocations that need attention with respect to the reduction of these \nmaterials. I believe the greatest threat we face in this country is the \nfact that--hopefully not, but the situation where a terrorist might \ngain control of these materials, bring them into this country and use \nthem with devastating effect.\n  So this amendment recognizes the most immediate threat comes from \nthese materials and therefore is putting additional resources from the \nNational Missile Defense Program, modest changes, to approach this \nmajor effort with respect to cooperative threat reduction.\n  The funds would come from our ground-based midcourse defense system. \nThe interceptors and silos where the offsets occur are now currently \nbeing deployed at Fort Greely, AK, and Vandenberg Air Force Base in \nCalifornia. Because of recent developments, we have an opportunity to \naddress the critical issue of loose nukes by transferring these funds. \nI would argue this is a most worthy cause. The offset will not affect \nthe missile defense system at all. In fact, as we understand it, in the \nlast several months the missile defense system has been reevaluating \nitself, looking at whether the technical issues are challenging, in \nfact, and have not conducted tests as they thought they could over the \nlast several months. So I think now is the opportune time to put more \nresources in cooperative threat reduction.\n  We are all aware, as I have mentioned before, that the greatest \nthreat to us today is the possibility that terrorists will acquire \nnuclear weapons or nuclear material and use it with devastating effect \nagainst us. Of course, one country with enormous amounts of this \nnuclear material is Russia.\n  It is estimated that Russia has approximately 16,000 nuclear weapons \nstored at between 150 and 210 sites. While that is a significant \nreduction from the 40,000 weapons at the end of the Cold War, it is \nstill a huge number of weapons and also a large number of storage \nsites.\n  Indeed, there is some imprecision about where all the sites might be. \nOf course, we have also heard reports of potential sites for, if not \nnuclear material, other dangerous material in former components of the \nSoviet Union, the newly independent states. So this is a challenging \nissue we have to face.\n  Only about 25 percent of the total number of weapons sites have \nreceived any upgrades in the past five years. Many of them still lack \nadequate security and safeguards. At the rate planned for in the fiscal \nyear 2006 budget request, it would be around 2011 or 2012 before the \nwork at only a portion of the sites would be completed to bring them up \nto levels of security and safety that we would feel confident this \nnuclear material would not be stolen, misplaced or somehow find itself \nin the world community.\n  The Defense Department only expected work to be scheduled on one or \ntwo sites in fiscal year 2006 so they budgeted approximately $60 \nmillion in the process. But then in February, when President Bush and \nPresident Putin met at the summit in Bratislava, Slovakia, the two \nagreed on a way to address security upgrades at 15 key nuclear weapons \nsites. With this agreement, we have the opportunity to accomplish in 2 \nyears what we thought would take 10.\n  The issue, of course, is funding. The total cost of these upgrades is \napproximately $350 million. With this amendment, we are adding $50 \nmillion to this project, which is not the total needed but will allow \nfor a good start. Again, this is a huge breakthrough that occurred \nafter the President's budget submission. It is a major opportunity we \nsimply must take advantage of.\n  As I have indicated before, the proposal of Senator Levin is to move \nthis $50 million into cooperative threat reduction from the National \nMissile Defense Program. I think it is useful to look at this program \nto indicate where these transfers are possible, available, and even \ndesirable.\n  When President Bush first took office in 2001, he made missile \ndefense one of his highest priorities. In May 2000, President Bush said \nAmerica must build effective missile defense based on the best \navailable options at the earliest possible date. Missile defense must \nbe designed to protect all 50 States, our friends, allies, and deployed \nforces overseas from missile attacks by rogue nations or accidental \nlaunches. President Bush's first major action was to significantly \nincrease funding for missile defense.\n  Since fiscal year 2002, approximately $45 billion, including fiscal \nyear 2006 requests, has been provided for missile defense. That is $45 \nbillion and here we are talking about a transfer of $50 million from \nthat huge program. This amount is half of what has been spent on \nmissile defense since President Reagan launched the Strategic Defense \nInitiative in 1984. We have seen a huge acceleration of funding with \nrespect to missile defense. Another aspect of President Bush's plan \nfor missile defense was that the systems would be developed and \nacquired under an approach called spiral development. As the \nCongressional Research Service succinctly summarizes: A major \nconsequence of the administration's proposed evolutionary acquisition \nstrategy is that the Missile Defense Program would not feature the \nfamiliar phases and milestones of the traditional DOD acquisition \nsystem. Another consequence is the Missile Defense Agency cannot \nprovide Congress with a description of its final missile defense \narchitecture, the capabilities\n\n[[Page S8775]]\n\non any near or longer term system, the specific dates by which most \nelements of the emerging architecture are to be tested and deployed, or \nan estimate of the eventual costs of the Missile Defense Program.\n\n  So President Bush's plan was to spend an enormous amount of money in \na short period of time with little plan and no traditional checks and \nbalances with respect to traditional procurement programs.\n  This program has, in fact, come under self-generated pressures. Tests \nthat were proposed to be conducted over the last several months have \nbeen postponed and cancelled. There is a hard relook at the technology. \nThere is potential here, but certainly there is not the kind of \nprogress that would justify the robust spending to date and certainly \nnot indicate that they need an additional $50 million to keep doing \nwhat they are doing.\n  In the past, we have looked very carefully at this program of \nnational defense. Like so many others, I believe if we can produce--and \nI think we can ultimately--a workable system to protect this country, \nprotect its allies, our troops in the field, we have to do that, but we \nhave to do it with deliberate speed, and I would emphasize deliberate \nspeed, not all-out haste, which generally means waste.\n  I believe we should pursue this system, but I also believe we should \ntake the time to determine that the technology, which is \nextraordinarily complex, is mature and effective. So beginning in 2002, \nI offered amendments which I felt would improve the Missile Defense \nProgram. In the fiscal year 2003 bill, I introduced an amendment \nrequiring a report on flight testing of the ground-based midcourse \ndefense, or the GMD, system. In fiscal year 2004, I offered an \namendment which would direct that the Missile Defense Agency provide \ninformation on procurement, performance criteria, and operational test \nplans for ballistic missile defense programs. In fiscal year 2005, I \nintroduced an amendment requiring operationally realistic testing and \nindependent evaluation of the ballistic missile defense system.\n  All of these amendments were modified by the majority. Then they were \npassed. Indeed, it is unclear if they were not modified whether they \nwould have passed.\n  Furthermore, when the Missile Defense Agency met these requirements, \nin many instances details and quality of reporting were lacking. For \nthe most part, the Missile Defense Agency has been doing what it wants \nto do with very little detailed supervision by the Congress and it has \nled to a situation now where the program is being seriously looked at. \nWe certainly have not made the kind of technological breakthrough which \nwas anticipated. One thing is certain, we have spent a great deal of \nmoney in this pursuit.\n  Now, where we are today, interceptor tests are the critical tests \nwhich involve a real missile defense interceptor hitting a real target \nmissile. These tests are the only means to truly assess whether a \nmissile defense system has the chance of working against a real enemy \nmissile. There is nothing elaborate or sensational in this proposition. \nIn order to see if a system works, one has to take it out and use it. \nOne missile has to be fired against another missile and knock down the \nintruding missile. If that is done with enough frequency and enough \nconfidence, then the system is ready to go.\n  The first intercept flight test of the system was conducted in \nDecember 2002 and it failed. Six days after that test failure, \nPresident Bush announced the United States would deploy the missile \ndefense system. Usually such announcements are reserved for success, \nnot failure. In effect, it is almost like looking at a new, expensive \njet fighter prototype going down the way, malfunctioning and then \nturning around and saying let us buy a lot of them, let us put them in \nthe sky. That is not what most people believe is the appropriate \ncriteria for being operational.\n  Over the next 2 years, seven other planned tests were cancelled. Yet, \nin September 2004, the system was declared nearly operational, with six \ninterceptors at Fort Greely, AK, and two interceptors at Vandenberg Air \nForce Base. Three months later, in December 2004, the Missile Defense \nAgency then conducted the only second integrated flight test on a \nmultibillion system. It too failed, and the system was now described as \noperational in the near future.\n  On February 14, there was another integrated flight test and it too \nfailed. After these three consecutive failures, Lieutenant General \nObering, director of the Missile Defense Agency, established an \nindependent review team to examine test failures and recommend steps \nfor improving the test program. The team made some very interesting \nobservations.\n  First, I believe they confirmed suspicions that there was a rush to \ndeployment, a rush not justified by the technology, its maturity, and \nby the operational techniques that were necessary to deploy it, but \nsimply to get it deployed. The team report states:\n\n       There were several issues that led to the flight test \n     failures of the Integrated Flight Tests . . . With the focus \n     on rapid deployment of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense \n     system, there was not always adequate opportunity to fully \n     ground test the system prior to each flight attempt. \n     Again, skipping over critical steps to rush to a \n     deployment. The team also found:\n       Schedule has been the key challenge that drives daily \n     decision making and planning in the program.\n\n  Not the technological maturity of the system, not technical issues, \nbut schedule was driving the technology, not the other way around.\n  The independent review team also took issue with the spiral \ndevelopment and lack of testing. Again, in their words:\n\n       Due to the lack of application of a few well-known \n     verification specification and standards by the GMD program, \n     failure evidence suggests that some problems might have been \n     during the launch. The team feels that considerable \n     opportunity exists to improve the confidence in the \n     reliability of hardware and software by adopting industry \n     best practices that exist as specification and standards.\n\n  In effect saying, we have to have requirements, we have to have \nstandards, we have to have specifications, we have to be able to \nmeasure this program and its components before we rush to deploy it, \nmuch of it echoing comments made on this floor by myself and many \nothers.\n  The team report further states:\n\n       There are not enough ground tests available to verify/\n     validate system operational performance and reliability. The \n     Joint Program office should consider redirecting some \n     production assets for ground tests to gain a higher \n     confidence in the GMD system performance.\n\n  The GMD review team would again recommend, in their words:\n\n       The Ground-based Midcourse Defense Program enter a new \n     phase focused on Performance and Reliability Verification, in \n     which Missile Defense Agencies make tests and mission success \n     the primary objective. The new phase should validate the \n     technical baseline and should be event driven rather than \n     schedule driven.\n\n  In effect, build on success, don't build based on schedule.\n\n       General Obering also requested Rear Admiral Kate Paige to \n     direct a Mission Readiness Task Force to study the review \n     team's recommendations and put the program on a path to \n     flight test and management success.\n       The Mission readiness task force, under the Admiral, made \n     the following recommendation: Four interceptors previously \n     planned for near-term operational deployment will be diverted \n     to serve as ground test missiles. There will be a significant \n     increase in ground testing of all systems, components, and \n     processes before resuming flight testing. Contractors will be \n     held accountable for their performance. The first flight test \n     will not be an intercept test and the first intercept test \n     will not take place for more than a year.\n\n  Let me commend General Obering and the Missile Defense Agency for \nimplementing these recommendations. I believe they will go a long way \ntoward improving the missile defense system, an objective we all share. \nHowever, I note these recommendations sound very familiar and one could \nonly contemplate how much effort and money would have been saved if we \nhad approached the system this way from the beginning--not rushing to \nfailure, but building for success.\n  There are presently six ground-based interceptors in silos at Fort \nGreely and two in silos at Vandenberg Air Force base. The \nadministration also requested, and the Congress has already approved, \nmost of the funding for these 30 interceptors. As I have noted, there \nhas yet to be a successful flight test of these interceptors, so we are \nalready buying an additional 30 interceptors when we do not know how to \nmake the first 6 work. I think a responsible approach is to slow the \nallocation of\n\n[[Page S8776]]\n\nfunds for the procurement of these interceptors until they are proven \noperational and to use that funding for more pressing needs. This \namendment does that.\n  The President's budget request seeks long-lead funding for 10 \noperational interceptors and 8 flight test interceptors, 18 missiles in \nall. However, the actual production rate capacity for the interceptors \nis 1 per month, or 12 per year. That means the Defense Department is \nseeking funds for more missiles than they can build in 1 year. There is \nno need to pay for more interceptors than can be built in 1 year.\n  Instead, we can provide 1 year's worth of funding for 1 year's worth \nof missiles--12 instead of 18. This amendment will not cause a break in \nthe production line.\n  I also note the House Armed Services Committee, in its fiscal year \n2006 Defense authorization bill, reduced the long-lead funding for five \nof the operational interceptors. The administration has not indicated \nthat the proposed reduction would cause any serious problems for the \nprogram.\n  I also want to state that the President's budget request includes $53 \nmillion in long-lead funding for eight test missiles. It is essential \nto produce missiles for testing. This amendment would not reduce that \nfunding for the test missiles at all. We realize we are in the test \nphase. The problem becomes we are attempting to buy operational \nmissiles before we are sure the test missiles will really work. That, I \nthink, is at the heart of much of the criticism.\n  Our missile defense systems are robustly funded in this bill with \nabout $7 billion. What this amendment does is take money that cannot \neven be spent this year and allocate it to a new opportunity to prevent \nloose nukes, which is truly an imminent threat, an existential threat \nto this country. This amendment, which enhances security by funding one \nprogram without causing any harm to another program, is a win-win \nsituation, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  We are trying to exploit a diplomatic breakthrough that was \nengineered by President Bush in his meeting with President Putin that \nallows the expansion, rapidly, of inspection and securing of sites in \nthe former Soviet Union and Russia. We are taking a truly modest amount \nof money, given about $6 or $7 billion for overall missile defense, and \nusing that to try to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and \nnuclear materials across the globe, which is the most serious threat \nthat we face as a nation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might ask my distinguished colleague \na question or two. We are all good, strong supporters of the CTR \nprogram. But I am informed that you are taking $50 million from the \nmissiles. I will address that question momentarily. But I think the \nSenate should know this--and I ask if I am in error, if the Senator \nwould correct me, if not now, perhaps one of your staff members, in due \ncourse, could assist. The Senate should know there is $500 million of \nunspent 2005 money in the CTR program. The amendment would take this \nprogram, which as you point out has some test problems, and to give it \nthe body blow this amendment would render, for $50 million will \nvirtually cause a very severe perturbation in the production line. The \nSenator is familiar with how the production lines work. There are \nestimates of cost up to as much as $270 million to restart the line at \nsome point in the future. But with $500 million for 2005 unexpended in \nCTR, I hope, if colleagues look at this amendment fairly and \npractically, maybe judge it on the merits--the use of these funds, to \nme, is not a justification for supporting the amendment.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chairman for the question. My understanding is \nthat the production cycle for the system, these interceptors, is 12 per \nyear. Yet the budget is asking for more than that. So I don't think \ntaking $50 million--as I understand the amendment, $30 million taken \nfrom long-lead, ground-based interceptors--taking $30 million away I do \nnot think would upset the production line schedule. There is no intent \nto do that, and I think the effect would not be to do that also.\n  With respect to your point, which I think is well taken, about the \nbuildup in funds in the comprehensive threat reduction, some of that--\nwe will check more dutifully--but some of that to my knowledge is the \nresult of the inability to agree on a way to deal with some of these \nsites. We hope that difficulty has been substantially reduced by \nPresident Bush and President Putin's discussion in Bratislava. Now that \nthey have agreed on a framework, they can start applying this money.\n\n  Also, again, I think this money would be well spent, would not \ndisrupt the production of the missile systems, and just the sheer \nscale--this is $50 million total, $30 million from the ground-based \ninterceptors, $20 million for initial construction of silos and housing \nfor the interceptors--again, this is truly long-lead procurement. We \nhave, in my view, and I believe that of Senator Levin, much more of a \nproblem in the site in Russia that contains the nuclear materials.\n  We have all heard the horror stories of people being able to walk in, \nwalk around, and walk out of these sites without anybody interfering \nwith them--no electronic equipment or sensors that would detect or \nreport their presence to anyone's attention. So our view--my view, \nspeaking for myself--is that this money could be much better spent, \nwithout disrupting the missile defense program, by applying it to \ncomprehensive threat reduction.\n  Frankly, $500 million is an impressive amount of money that has not \nyet been spent, but we all recognize, if any of this material made its \nway outside these sites and got into the hands of irresponsible people, \nit would be serious.\n  Mr. WARNER. I agree with the Senator's premise but I wouldn't want \nSenators to believe that, if I am correct, the shortage of money is in \nCTR. I am informed there is, in the bank, $500 million of 2005 \nunexpended funds. Does the Senator want to address that now?\n  Mr. REED. I could say, Mr. President, we will try to determine this, \nbut unexpended does not mean that it is not committed. Some of these \nfunds could in fact be committed to specific sites already so that \nmoney can't be spent again elsewhere. We will try to get a number on \nthat.\n  But the scale of the problem, the number of sites--it is in the \norder, just within Russia, of 200 sites.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am a big supporter of CTR. I happened to be in the room \non the day CTR was born--by Sam Nunn. I will never forget it. I have \nfollowed the program. I have been a supporter. I think there is quite a \nbit of funding in this budget for CTR right now. I point out, if the \nSenator is persuaded by the fact that CTR needs the money more than the \nmissile program--and I will argue the point strenuously that is not the \ncase--there is quite a bit of money. We are way into the 2005 cycle. As \na matter of fact, September is on the horizon.\n  So I hope the Senator could carefully research that point, come back, \nand if I am in error, I would certainly like to hear his views.\n  I point out the current bill is consistent with the President's \nprogram that allocated $50 million toward this next tranche of the \nlong-lead, cumulative money for ground-based interceptors. If you take \n$30 million out of the $50 million, I assure you, that does \nconsiderable disruption to the production line.\n  Then I point out the amount available for construction of associated \nsilos, reduced by $20 million. I wonder if you might take the chance to \ncheck on the fact that the President's budget in this bill only \nallocates $13.5 million to the initial construction of the associated \nsilos, and therefore your $20 million is considerably in excess of the \n$13.5 million.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, my information indicates the fiscal year \n2006 budget for expansion, there is $20.682 million. I will ask my \nstaff to coordinate with your staff.\n  Mr. WARNER. We will have our staffs check those figures. I thank the \nSenator.\n  Mr. President, I would like to vigorously oppose this amendment for \nthe following reasons. The impact of the amendment would be, first and \nforemost, to send a message that we are not supporting, as a nation, \nwholeheartedly the ballistic missile defense capabilities to defend \nourselves. It is clear North Korea has capabilities. This program was \nengendered in large measure, and accelerated in large\n\n[[Page S8777]]\n\nmeasure because of the threat posed by North Korea.\n  I noted here recently that Japan is now building its missile defense \nsystem. So it is not that the United States alone, in the world of \nnations, considers it a threat; other nations consider the North Korean \ncapabilities a threat. It is correct we have had these test bans, but \nthe failures that more or less have been in the mechanical phase--\nsomehow the missile is adjusted in its launch pad as opposed to the \nactual failure of the missile itself. And then I will address this \nquestion of the break in production which could result--assuming the \nprogram is restarted in its full measure--maybe up to $270 million is \none estimate I have been given to restart it.\n\n  Again, I agree with the sponsors of the amendment that the \nCooperative Threat Reduction Program is an important national security \nissue for the defense of our homeland against the growing threats. But \nasking us to choose between missile protection and CTR is a false \nchoice. We need both. This bill funds the President's requested amount \nfully for both programs.\n  The bill before the Senate authorizes the requested amount of $415.5 \nmillion for CTR programs within the Department of Defense and $1.6 \nbillion for other nonproliferation efforts in the Department of Energy. \nThere is a very strong recognition in this bill before the Senate, the \nauthorization bill, of the importance of CTR. There is no current need \nfor extra CTR funds. That is our basic proposition. They have in the \nbank very substantial amounts from 2005. They are unexpended. Whether \nthey have been committed, I will have that checked. With a backlog that \nlarge and only roughly 70 days left in the fiscal year--that is an \nawful lot of money if someone is going to try to commit it and expend \nit in that period of time.\n  The President's budget for missile defense, on the other hand, has \nalready taken a considerable amount of cuts. Due to last-minute \ndecisions made at the Department of Defense as the fiscal year 2006 \nbudget was being finalized, the missile defense budget request was \nreduced by $1 billion in 2006 and $5 billion overall between 2006 and \n2011.\n  The sponsors of this amendment argue we should not provide long-lead \nfunding for the GBI missiles 31 to 40 because of test failures. I am \nmindful of the recent difficulties encountered by the GMD system test \nprogram, but it is my view and that of the Department--and, indeed, \nindependent authorities have looked at this problem--that these \ndifficulties do not represent serious technological hurdles by the GMD \nprogram. Indeed, such problems are to be expected during the R and \ndevelopment phase of complicated weapons systems.\n  To get at the root cause of the testing problems, the Director of the \nMissile Defense Agency, to his great credit, commissioned the \nIndependent Review Team, called the IRT, to examine the recent GMD test \nfailures. The IRT found, one, that no fundamental GMD system design \nflaws are related to the recent test failures. Moreover, this \nindependent panel found no evidence that major modifications of the \ncurrent system hardware or software will be required. In other words, \nit is unlikely that future testing will find some major fault in the \nsystem that will require costly retrofit to the already fielded and \nthose in production line of the GBIs.\n  For those of my colleagues concerned about testing, I point out that \nthis bill before you contains a provision--developed in a bipartisan \nfashion during the committee's markup--which requires the Missile \nDefense Agency, the service operational test agencies, and the Director \nof Operational Test and Evaluation to plan and conduct tests that \ndemonstrate the operational capability of the ballistic missile defense \nsystem. The bill also reallocates $100 million from longer-term \ndevelopment efforts to GMD testing, consistent with the recommendations \nof the Independent Review Team.\n  The current and growing threat posed to our country by long-range \nballistic missiles argues for proceeding without delay with the \nDepartment's approach of concurrent testing and fielding of ballistic \nmissile defense capabilities for the homeland.\n  Some of my colleagues suggest that because the current system is not \nfully proven, we should not procure additional missile interceptors. To \nthis I would respond that General Cartwright, Commander of U.S. \nStrategic Command--the senior military official charged with advising \nthe Secretary of Defense and the President on missile defense matters--\nhas testified, with respect to the current GMD system, that ``in an \nemergency, we are in fact in the position that we are confident that we \ncan operate and employ it.''\n  In addition, the Pentagon's chief independent weapons tester, the \nDirector for Operational Test and Evaluation, noted in his most recent \nAnnual Report to Congress that ``the test bed architecture is now in \nplace and should have some limited capability to defend against a \nthreat missile from North Korea.''\n  In my view, it is a good thing that we have some capability--albeit \nlimited--to defend the homeland against long-range missiles. For as \nGeneral Cartwright testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee \nin April, ``we have a realistic threat here; we have an imperative.''\n  General Cartwright is referring to CIA and DIA estimates that the \nNorth Korean Taepo-Dong 2 ballistic missile is capable of reaching the \nUnited States with a nuclear warhead--and that North Korea could resume \nflight testing of the Taepo-Dong 2 at any time. The Defense \nIntelligence Agency also estimates that Iran will have the capability \nto develop an intercontinental ballistic missile, ICBM, by 2015.\n  We simply can't wait until the threat is upon us to deploy missile \ndefenses; we can't wait until the GMD system is fully and completely \ntested before we start providing some measure of protection against \nthis threat. It is our responsibility to field what capabilities \ncurrently exist, even while we continue to test and improve the system. \nBy continuing to field missile defenses today, we send a message to \npotential adversaries that we will not be deterred or coerced by their \npossession of long-range ballistic missiles.\n  In summary, I ask my colleagues to reject the amendment offered by \nSenator Levin. This amendment would needlessly delay the fielding of a \nballistic missile defense capability to protect the homeland. As the \nCommander of STRATCOM warns, the threat is real. We must continue on \nthe current path of fielding available capabilities--even while testing \ncontinues to improve the system over time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President I express my gratitude to the distinguished \nchairman and other members of the Senate Committee on Armed Services \nfor the work they do. The chairman has worked long and hard to try to \nbring this bill to the Senate floor and do things in the best interest \nof our country, and others have worked with him. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today as an ardent supporter of the \nF/A-22 Raptor. I am pleased that the Armed Services Committee has \nagreed to authorize appropriations for 24 F/A-22 Raptors. However, I am \ndeeply troubled that the Department of Defense has made the decision to \nonly purchase this extraordinary aircraft through fiscal year 2008, in \neffect, limiting the number of Raptors to 180. This is far below the \n381 aircraft that the Air Force has repeatedly stated are required for \nthat service to meet its responsibilities as outlined in the National \nDefense Strategy.\n  Over the past year and half, I have made two trips, to be briefed on \nthe capabilities of this extraordinary aircraft. The first was to \nTyndall Air Force Base, FL, where our pilots are learning to fly the \nRaptor and second to Langley Air Force, VA, where the first operational \nF/A-22 units will be based. As a result of these meetings and \ndiscussions with the pilots who are training to fly the aircraft and \nthe ground personnel who are learning to maintain the Raptor, I have \ncome to conclusion that purchasing sufficient numbers of Raptors is \nabsolutely vital to our national security.\n  Over the past 30 years, the United States has been able to maintain \nair superiority in every conflict largely due to the F-15C. However, \nwith the great advancements in technology over the past several years, \nthe F-15 has struggled to keep pace. For example,\n\n[[Page S8778]]\n\nthe F-15 is not a stealth aircraft and its computer systems are based \non obsolete technology. My colleagues should remember that the F-15 \nfirst flew in the early 1970s. During the ensuing years, nations have \nbeen consistently developing new aircraft and missile systems to defeat \nthis fighter.\n  Realizing that the F-15 would need a replacement, the Air Force \ndeveloped the F/A-22 Raptor. The result is a truly remarkable aircraft.\n  The F/A-22 has greater stealth capabilities than the F-117 Nighthawk. \nThis is a powerful attribute when one remembers that it was the \nNighthawk's stealth characteristics that enabled that aircraft to \npenetrate the integrated air defenses of Baghdad during the first night \nof the 1991 gulf war.\n  The Raptor is also equipped with super-cruise engines. These engines \ndo not need to go to after-burner in order to achieve supersonic \nflight. This provides the F/A-22 with a strategic advantage by enabling \nsupersonic speeds to be maintained for a far greater length of time. By \ncomparison, all other fighters require their engines and these are \nforeign fighters, as well--to go to after-burner to achieve supersonic \nspeeds. This consumes a tremendous amount of fuel and greatly limits an \naircraft's range.\n  The F/A-22 is also the most maneuverable fighter flying today. This \nis of particular importance when encountering newer Russian-made \naircraft which boast a highly impressive maneuver capability.\n  Yet a further advantage resides in the F/A-22's radar and avionics. \nWhen entering hostile airspace, one F/A-22 can energize its radar \nsystem, enabling it to detect and engage enemy fighters far before an \nenemy's system effective range.\n\n  However, one of the most important capabilities of the Raptor is \noften the most misunderstood. Many critics of the program state that, \nsince much of the design work for this aircraft was performed during \nthe Cold War, it does not meet the requirements of the future, I \nbelieve that this criticism is misplaced. The F/A-22 is more than just \na fighter, it is also a bomber. In its existing configuration it is \nable to carry two 1,000 pound GPS-guided JDAM bombs and the aircraft \nwill also be able to carry the Small Diameter Bomb. In 2008, the F/A-\n22's radar system will be enhanced with a ``look-down'' mode enabling \nthe Raptor to independently hunt for targets on the ground.\n  All of these capabilities are necessary to fight what is quickly \nemerging as ``the'' threat of the future--the anti-access integrated \nair defense system. Integrated air defenses include both surface to air \nmissiles and fighters deployed in such a fashion as to leverage the \nstrengths of both systems. Such a system could pose a very real \npossibility of denying U.S. aircraft access to strategically important \nregions during future conflicts.\n  It should also be noted that--for a comparably cheap price--an \nadversary can purchase the Russian SA-20 surface-to-air missile. This \nsystem has an effective range of approximately 120 nautical miles and \ncan engage targets at greater then 100,000 feet, much higher then the \nservice ceiling of any existing American fighter or bomber. The \nRussians have also developed a family of highly maneuverable fighters, \nthe Su-30 and 35s, which have been sold to such nations as China. Of \nfurther import, 59 other nations have fourth generation fighters.\n  It has also been widely reported in the aviation media that the F-\n15C, our current air superiority fighter, is not as maneuverable as \nnewer Russian aircraft, especially the Su-35. However, the F/A-22 is \ndesigned to defeat an integrated air defense system. By utilizing its \nstealth capability, the F/A-22 can penetrate an enemy's airspace \nundetected and, when modified, independently hunt for mobile surface-\nto-air missile systems. Once detected, the F/A-22 would then be able to \ndrop bombs on those targets. Some, correctly state that the B-2 bomber \nand the F-117 could handle these assignments. However, the F/A-22 \noffers the additional capability of being able to engage an enemy's air \nsuperiority fighters such as the widely proficient Su-35. Therefore, \nthe Raptor will be able to defeat, almost simultaneously, two very \ndifferent threats that until now have been handled by two different \ntypes of aircraft.\n  I should like point out that these potential threats are not just \nfuture concerns, but they are here today. For example, last year the \nAir Force conducted an exercise called Cope India, as part of our \neffort to strengthen relations with India. The Indian Air Force has a \nnumber of Su-30 MKKs, an aircraft which is very similar to a version of \naircraft sold in large quantities to the People's Republic of China. \nDuring this exercise, it has been widely reported in the aviation and \ndefense media that the Indian Air Force's Su-30s won a number of \nengagements when training against our Air Force's F-15s.\n  So let me be clear on this point: a developing nation's air force was \nable to defeat the F-15. This was a stunning event and one that \nrequires our immediate attention.\n  Despite the obvious advantages, and now necessity, of this aircraft, \nthe Department of Defense has made the decision to purchase only 180 F/\nA-22s.\n  Some argue that the cost of this aircraft is too high.\n  In response, the supporters of the \nF/A-22 devised a new procurement strategy called ``Buy to Budget.'' \nThis strategy capped the total cost for the procurement of the aircraft \nand forced the Air Force and the Raptor's primary contractor, Lockheed \nMartin, to cut the cost of plane. These efforts have so far been \nsuccessful, and two years ago an additional F/A-22 was procured solely \nbased upon savings.\n  I am also pleased to state that recent articles in the media report \nthat the ``fly-away'' price for an F/A-22 is now approximately $130 \nmillion, down from $185 million an aircraft. Officials of the \nmanufacturer are quoted as saying that each new lot of Raptors costs on \naverage 13 percent less than its predecessor. The manufacturer also \nbelieves that this price can be further brought down to the $110 \nmillion range. Now, of course, this is still a lot of money. However, \nwhen compared to similar aircraft such as the nonstealth Eurofighter, \nwhich cost approximately $110 million an aircraft, coupled with the \nestimated cost, as high as $90 million, for a new F-15, one easily \nconclude that the F/A-22 is much better deal then its critics contend.\n  I wish to reiterate a point that is deeply troubling. I have always \nlistened very closely when our servicemembers have outlined their \nequipment requirements based upon the national security goals that our \nGovernment has outlined. As I have studied this issue, I have been \nstruck by the unanimous opinion of all the members of the Air Force to \nwhom I have spoken.\n  What is their expert opinion? That if the Air Force is to succeed in \nthe tasks outlined in our National Defense Strategy that they require \nadditional F/A-22 aircraft.\n  I should also add that this is not just the opinion of those \nstationed here in Washington but the opinion of the pilots and ground \ncrew in the field such as those of Tyndall Air Force Base and Langley \nAir Force Base. They were truly excited about the F/A-22 Raptor's \npotential.\n  They understand that this aircraft will ensure American dominance of \nthe skies for the next half century.\n  These young men and women stand ready to sacrifice so much for us, we \nowe them the best that our country has to offer. Therefore, I \nrespectfully urge my friends in the Department of Defense to rethink \ntheir plans for this aircraft and provide our warfighters sufficient \nnumbers of this remarkable fighter/bomber.\n  I ask that the pending amendment be set aside so I can call up \nanother amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1516\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], for himself, Mr. Inhofe, \n     Mr. Bennett, and Mr. Chambliss, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1516.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S8779]]\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the investment \n  of funds as called for in the Depot Maintenance Strategy and Master \n                         Plan of the Air Force)\n\n       On page 66, after line 22, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 330. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING DEPOT MAINTENANCE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Depot Maintenance Strategy and Master Plan of the \n     Air Force reflects the essential requirements for the Air \n     Force to maintain a ready and controlled source of organic \n     technical competence, thereby ensuring an effective and \n     timely response to national defense contingencies and \n     emergency requirements;\n       (2) since the publication of the Depot Maintenance Strategy \n     and Master Plan of the Air Force in 2002, the service has \n     made great progress toward modernizing all 3 of its Depots, \n     in order to maintain their status as ``world class'' \n     maintenance repair and overhaul operations;\n       (3) one of the indispensable components of the Depot \n     Maintenance Strategy and Master Plan of the Air Force is the \n     commitment of the Air Force to allocate $150,000,000 a year \n     over 6 years, beginning in fiscal year 2004, for \n     recapitalization and investment, including the procurement of \n     technologically advanced facilities and equipment, of our \n     Nation's 3 Air Force depots; and\n       (4) the funds expended to date have ensured that \n     transformation projects, such as the initial implementation \n     of ``Lean'' and ``Six Sigma'' production techniques, have \n     achieved great success in reducing the time necessary to \n     perform depot maintenance on aircraft.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Air Force should be commended for the \n     implementation of its Depot Maintenance Strategy and Master \n     Plan and, in particular, meeting its commitment to invest \n     $150,000,000 a year over 6 years, since fiscal year 2004, in \n     the Nation's 3 Air Force Depots; and\n       (2) the Air Force should continue to fully fund its \n     commitment of $150,000,000 a year through fiscal year 2009 in \n     investments and recapitalization projects pursuant to the \n     Depot Maintenance Strategy and Master Plan.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Today I rise to propose an amendment that is cosponsored \nby fellow members of the Senate Air Force Depot Caucus, specifically \nSenators Inhofe, Bennett and Chambliss. Before I proceed to discuss the \nmerits of my amendment, I thank publicly my colleagues, and their \nstaffs, of the depot caucus, not only for their assistance in \nsupporting this amendment, but for the tireless work that we have all \nperformed over the past several years to modernize and recapitalize our \nNation's Air Force Depots.\n  Why is that important? Why do we need our Air Force Depots? Simply \nput, today the United States boasts the most formidable military that \nthe world has ever known. However, history has shown, that a \ntechnologically superior force can be defeated if the weapons systems \nbeing utilized by that force cannot be maintained or repaired in a \ntimely fashion.\n  Mindful of this lesson, the Department of Defense and Congress have \ncreated an infrastructure designed to meet the unique sustainment \nchallenges faced by a nation that harnesses the advantages of \ntechnology on the battlefield. It bears remembering that one of our \nNation's primary means of maintaining this advantage is through the \nintegrated sustainment support provided by the Air Force's depots. This \nis true for the maintenance of tactical aircraft, such as the F-16 and \nA-10, which is performed in my home State of Utah at Hill Air Force \nBase. Tactical aircraft require this level of maintenance due to the \nstress caused by supersonic flight and high-g turns. Our tanker and \nairlift fleets also require this level of service due to corrosion and \nmetal fatigue.\n  Equally impressive, this support is accomplished while simultaneously \nproviding supply chain management for millions of components and pieces \nof equipment. However, what makes our depots truly vital to national \nsecurity is their ability to provide immediate support during periods \nof conflict or urgent need. In fact, no one matches our Nation's depots \nin meeting the critical ``surge'' requirements of our Nation.\n  Unfortunately, during the 1990s, our Nation did not make the \nnecessary investments in our depots to build and procure \ntechnologically advanced facilities and equipment technologies. \nTherefore, the depots were not meeting their full potential. Congress \nand the Air Force identified this problem and, I am proud to say, \nworked together to find a solution. That solution was the Air Force \nDepot Maintenance Strategy and Master Plan. This strategy reaffirmed \nour Nation's commitment to the ``essential requirement for the Air \nForce to maintain a ready and controlled source of organic technical \ncompetence to ensure an effective and timely response to national \ndefense contingencies and emergency requirements.''\n  But more than just a piece of paper articulating lofty goals, this \nstrategy committed the Air Force to allocating $150 million a year for \n6 years in order to achieve the objectives of maintaining the depots \nstatus as ``world class'' maintenance repair and overhaul operations.\n  One of the most clear examples of how this money has been \nconstructively allocated can be found in the success of the initial \nimplementation of revolutionary lean production techniques at our \nNation's depots. Lean manufacturing principles, first developed by the \nToyota Corporation, aim to eliminate waste in every area of production. \nIn practice, workers are no longer just responsible for a specific \nsection of production. Workers are challenged to develop new skills and \ntrades so they are responsible for more portions of the production \nprocess.\n  The results have been outstanding. Workflow days, the days it takes \nto provide maintenance to a part or system, are down. At Hill Air Force \nBase, the C-130 and F-16 aircraft maintenance lines have achieved and \nsustained 100-percent on-time delivery rates, a large extent due to the \nefficiencies created by lean techniques. When you tour our depots, you \ncan sense the excitement and renewed pride the workers have, in part, \nbecause of the lean processes and the new tools and infrastructure \nprovided by the funds allocated by the Depot Strategy which make lean \npossible. This has truly been a successful investment.\n  Another example of how the funds allocated under the Depot Strategy \nare assisting the war fighter while providing value to the taxpayer can \nbe found in a project in this year's Defense authorization bill. Hill \nAir Force Base is home to one of only two Carnegie Mellon-rated capable \nmaturity model level 5 software centers in the Department of Defense. A \nlevel 5 designation facility indicates that the facility is in the top \n2 percent of all software development centers. In addition, Hill's \nSoftware Engineering Division affords the Air Force a $40-per-hour \nlabor rate savings over its major industry competitors.\n  For these reasons, the Air Force decided to increase the amount of \nwork performed by the division by 176,000 direct product standard \nhours. However, the existing building is full and unable to support the \nincrease in personnel necessary to accomplish this new workload. The \nfunding allocated under the Depot Maintenance Strategy provides the \nsolution, and this bill authorizes appropriations to build a new \nextension to the facility. Not too bad when it has been determined that \nthis project will pay for itself in 8.75 years.\n  We are only halfway through the 6-year investment plan as called for \nby the Depot Maintenance Strategy. I rise with my colleagues to say to \nthe Air Force: Well done. But I must add--and this is the essential \npoint of my amendment--the Air Force must keep going. The depots have \nmade enormous progress in even further efficiently supporting the war \nfighter, which now is more important than ever. However, if we are to \nsupport our war fighters in the manner in which they deserve, this \ninvestment must continue. The first steps have been made. Completing \nthe full 6 years of Depot Strategy modernization funding is an \nessential component to ensure we will always provide the best to the \nmen and women who risk so much to keep us free.\n  Mr. President, I also desire at this time to thank three individuals \nwho have been steadfast supporters of the Depot Maintenance Strategy.\n  First, I must recognize retiring Assistant Secretary of the Air Force \nNelson Gibbs, who is one of the authors of Depot Strategy. We would not \nbe where we are today without his support and guidance. I wish him well \nin his well-deserved retirement. I also wish to thank the implementers \nof the Strategy, GEN Lester Lyles, the former commander of Air Force \nMateriel Command and its present commander, and\n\n[[Page S8780]]\n\nmy good friend, GEN Gregory Martin. You will not find two finer \nofficers who have ever served. To them I say: Thank you for your \nleadership and guidance in modernizing our infrastructure so we can \nmost efficiently and effectively support the war fighter. I thank them.\n  I thank my colleagues, all of whom support this as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I will first make a comment or two.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may the manager of the bill address the \nSenate for a moment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Oklahoma yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the way we run is the managers usually try \nto get recognition.\n  What we would now like to do, Mr. President, is to have the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma address his amendments--for what period of time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. Chairman, I would like to have a few minutes to \nrespond to some of the substance of the two subjects discussed by the \nSenator from Utah. Then I would like to describe the amendments I have \noffered. It will probably take me 20 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The Senator from Florida desires recognition, so I would ask the \nSenator from Florida if he could give a rough estimate of the time he \nwould like following the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Fifteen minutes. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Oklahoma now be recognized for a period not to exceed 20 \nminutes, to be followed by the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Could we act on the UC request, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, let me say I was listening \nintently while the senior Senator from Utah talked about the F/A-22. I \nwould like to add one thing that perhaps he assumes everyone is aware \nof, but I keep finding people are not aware of it, and that is the \nChief of the Air Force now, General Jumper, not too long ago, I think \n1997, made a very courageous observation. He called to the attention of \nthe American people that the Russians were making--at that time he was \nreferring to the Su-30, a strike vehicle, that it was actually better \nthan anything we had in our inventory, our F-15 or F-16.\n  I think a lot of people assumed automatically that when we go onto \nthe battlefield America has the very best of equipment. That is not \ntrue. It is kind of scary when you think about a strike vehicle that is \nout there that has greater capability than our very best and the fact \nthat the American people expect the United States to have the best of \neverything.\n  I have talked on this floor many times about the fact that our \nartillery piece is not as good as one that is made in five different \ncountries. The old Paladin technology is World War II technology. That \nis something we are going to correct with our future combat system.\n  But I commend the Senator from Utah for his comments about the F/A-\n22. When we get the joint strike fighter and the F/A-22, we will be \nback in a position where we will be sending our young people out there \nwith the best of equipment. We need to get there as rapidly as \npossible.\n  I also want to make a comment about the depot funding plan amendment \nthat is offered by Senator Hatch. It supports the important and vital \nwork being performed by our aircraft depot facilities.\n\n  Since the Bush administration came into office, we have seen a \nrenewed interest in the Air Force's depots. To kind of fill us in where \nwe are right now with that, I can remember when the last Secretary of \nthe Air Force came in, his first trip was to Tinker Air Force Base to \nsee how creative they were, to kind of personally examine the kind of \nwork they were doing. He recognized we have to handle the problem that \nhas been there for many, many years; that is, we need to have an in-\nhouse capability for depot maintenance on core issues.\n  The problem has always been: How do you define the core issue? The \ncore issue is not an easy thing to describe and define. But until it is \nproperly defined, we have been using the ratio of 50-50; in other \nwords, to have the in-house capability to handle 50 percent of the \nfunctions in the case of a war so we would not be held hostage to a \nsingle source contractor.\n  The key to this overall reinvigoration has been the Air Force's Depot \nMaintenance Strategy and Master Plan that will ensure America's air and \nspace assets are ready to rapidly respond to any national security \nthreat. Because of this plan we have begun a restoration and \nmodernization of our Air Force's three depot facilities located in \nOklahoma, Utah, and Georgia, which will ensure the United States is \nable to maintain world-class aircraft repair and overall facilities.\n  If we are to realize the end result of this Maintenance Strategy and \nMaster Plan, it is incumbent upon Congress to fulfill the Air Force's \ncommitment for allocating $150 million a year, over a 6-year period, \nfor recapitalizing, investing, and procuring advanced facilities, \nequipment, and operation. This funding began in fiscal year 2004, and \nsignificant in-roads have already been made.\n  In one year alone, with this funding support, the Air Mobility \nCommand reported that the rate of aircraft grounded due to parts issues \ndecreased by 37.6 percent. It bettered its flying hour goal by 922,000 \nhours. The rate of aircraft incidents due to parts issues decreased by \n23.4 percent. Logistics response time increased by 20.4 percent. And \nthe level of spare parts in stock improved by 5.5 percent. Such \nimprovements are an indication of the impact of this funding, and this \nwas only a single 1-year period.\n  We have spoken frequently in this body about the advanced age and \nchallenges of some of our most critical low-density, high-demand \naircraft, such as the C-130 tactical airlifter, and the KC-135 \nrefueling tanker. The average age of the C-130 E and H models flying \ntoday is 40 years. The average age of the KC-135 E and R models flying \ntoday is 44 years. We went through some arduous times, several years \nago--about 15 years ago--getting the C-17 on line. It was a recognition \nthat we have to modernize this fleet. I am very thankful we have \nincreased the numbers as the years have gone by. No one would have ever \nbelieved, prior to Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq, the need we \nwould have on these heavy-lift vehicles.\n  We could go on and on, but the point we want to make is, if we are \ngoing to keep our aging fleet of aircraft flying, we must not only \nmaintain them but we must also modify them and give them the latest \ntechnology, avionics and things, so we will provide our young people \nwith the same advantage that some of our prospective opponents would \nhave.\n  At our Air Force depots today, we require engineers and fabrication \ntechnicians to solve ever-challenging design and structural problems \ndue to aircraft stress and fatigue that were never anticipated when the \naircraft were manufactured. But because of age, we are seeing such \nflaws. The civilian aviation industry recapitalizes, buying new \naircraft when their planes are no longer feasible to fly. \nUnfortunately, our Air Force does not have such a luxury. The effort \nthe Air Force has started with the Depot Maintenance Strategy and \nMaster Plan must be sustained, and Congress must provide the necessary \nresources.\n  In light of this, I applaud the sense of the Senate being offered by \nSenator Hatch. This has been a problem we have seen coming. We know it \nis there. We have been able to now give our depots some of the same \nresources, some of the same modernization. They have, on a competitive \nbasis, proven they can do a very good job.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1313\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have two amendments I have already \nfiled. The second amendment is going to require a new number. The two I \nam going to be discussing are the ICRC amendment. I have several \ncosponsors of the amendment, including Senator Kyl. I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Enzi be added as a cosponsor to amendment No. \n1313.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The other amendment has a new number. We have talked \nabout it before. It is the U.S.-China\n\n[[Page S8781]]\n\nCommission amendment. It is now No. 1476. It is my intention to make a \nfew comments about these two and then to ask for the yeas and nays. We \nwould like to get to a vote on these amendments by tonight.\n  First, the amendment concerning the ICRC. I simply want to clarify \nsome people's thinking that the ICRC is not the American Red Cross. \nThis is the International Committee on the Red Cross. It has no \nrelationship to the American Red Cross.\n  My first concern is for American troops. The ICRC has been around \nsince 1863 and has been there for American soldiers, sailors, airmen, \nand marines throughout two world wars. I thank them for that work. \nLikewise and moreover, I thank all Americans for military service to \nAmerica. I did have occasion to be in the U.S. Army. It was the best \nthing that ever happened in my life. In my continuing preeminent \nconcern for American troops, however, I am compelled to note some \nconcerns and pose some questions about a drift in focus of the ICRC \naway from its core principles in its mission statement. Indeed, I fear \nthe ICRC may be harming the morale of our American troops by \nunjustified allegations that detainees and prisoners are not being \nproperly treated.\n  For example, an ICRC official visited Camp Bucca, a theater \ninternment facility for enemy prisoners that is, as of January 2005, \nbeing operated by the 18th Military Police Brigade and Task Force 134, \nnear Umm Qasr in southern Iraq. As of late January 2005, the facility \nhad a holding capacity of 6,000 prisoners but only held 5,000. These \nprisoners were being supervised by 1,200 Army MPs and Air Force airmen. \nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, citing a Defense Department \nsource, the ICRC official told U.S. authorities:\n\n       You people are no better than and no different than the \n     Nazi concentration camp guards.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this entire article be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks about the ICRC.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee has now held 13 hearings on the \ntopic of prisoner treatment.\n  Sometimes we get bogged down in all the detail and we forget about \nthe overall picture, the big picture. And I'm shocked when I found, \nonly last Tuesday, from the Pentagon's report, that after 3 years and \n24,000 interrogations, there were only three acts of violation of the \napproved interrogation techniques authorized by Field Manual 3452 and \nDOD guidelines.\n  The small infractions found were found by our own government, \ncorrected and now reported. In all the cases no further incidents \noccurred. We have nothing to be ashamed of. What other country attacked \nas we were would exercise the same degree of self-criticism and \nrestraint. Again, keep in mind, 24,000 interrogations, and they only \nfound three. And they were found by us, not somebody else snooping \naround.\n  Most, if not all, of these incidents are at least a year old. I am \nvery impressed with the way the military, the FBI, and other agencies \nconducted themselves. The report shows me that an incredible amount of \nrestraint and discipline was present at Gitmo.\n  Having heard a lot about the Field Manual 3452, I asked, ``Are the \nDOD guidelines, as currently published in that manual, appropriate to \nallow interrogators to get valuable information, intelligence \ninformation, while not crossing the line from interrogation to abuse?'' \nThe answer from Gen. Bantz J. Craddock, Commander of U.S. Southern \nCommand was, ``I think, because that manual was written for enemy \nprisoners of war, we have a translation problem, in that enemy \nprisoners are to be treated in accordance with the Geneva Conventions--\nthat doesn't apply. That's why the recommendation was made and I \naffirmed it. We need a further look here on this new phenomenon of \nenemy combatants. It's different, and we're trying to use, I think, a \nmanual that was written for one reason in another environment.''\n  Lt. Gen. Randall M. Schmidt, the senior investigating officer said, \n``Sir, I agree. It's critical that we come to grips with not hanging on \na Cold War relic of Field Manual 3452, which addressed an entirely \ndifferent population. If we are, in fact, going to get intelligence to \nstay ahead of this type of threat, we need to understand what else we \ncan do and still stay in our lane of humane treatment.''\n  Brig. Gen. John T. Furlow, the investigating officer, stated, ``Sir, \nin echoing that, F.M. 3452 was originally written in 1987, further \nupdated and refined in 1992, which is dealing with the Geneva question \nas well as an ordered battle enemy, not the enemy that we're facing \ncurrently. I'm aware that Fort Huachuca's currently in a rewrite of the \nnext 3452, and it's in a draft form right now.''\n  It is clear that our military has humane treatment placed at the \nforefront of their concerns.\n  At the same time I want to ask: What other country would freely \ndiscuss interrogation techniques used against high-value intelligence \ndetainees during a time of war when suicide bombers are killing our \nfellow citizens?\n  That was disturbing to me. The last of the many hearings we had was \none where they were describing in detail our interrogation techniques, \nknowing full well that the terrorists are watching on live TV and \ntraining their people on how to handle those. I think it is something \non which we have gone far enough. That is another subject we will be \ndiscussing in a few minutes.\n  In the past 15 years, the United States has provided more than $1.5 \nbillion in funding to the ICRC. I ask for some accountability for the \nuse of this money and a modicum of oversight. For example, I think it \nis fair to ask: How is our money being spent? What are the activities \nof the ICRC to determine the status of American POWs/MIAs, unaccounted \nfor since World War II? What were the efforts of the ICRC to assist \nAmerica's POWs held in captivity during the Korean war, the Vietnam \nwar, and other subsequent conflicts? Has the ICRC exceeded its mandate, \nviolated established practices or principles, or engaged in advocacy \nwork that exceeds the ICRC's mandate as provided under the Geneva \nConvention? That essentially is what this amendment does.\n  At this point I will read the very last paragraph of the Wall Street \nJournal article. It says:\n\n       We are trying to understand how a representative of an \n     organization pledged to neutrality and the honest \n     investigation of detainee practices could compare American \n     soldiers to Nazi SS. And considering the timing and content \n     of several ICRC confidentiality breaches concerning the U.S. \n     war on terror, it's fair to ask if similar views aren't held \n     by a substantial number in the organization.\n       The world needs a truly neutral humanitarian body of the \n     sort the ICRC is supposed to be. But the Camp Bucca \n     incident--in addition to leaked Gitmo and Abu Ghraib \n     reports--is evidence it isn't currently up to the task.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 23, 2005]\n\n                          As Bad as the Nazis?\n\n       The International Committee of the Red Cross is granted a \n     privileged status to inspect the conditions of prisoners of \n     war and other detainees in return for confidentiality. But in \n     recent years it has demonstrated a habit of selective media \n     leaks damaging to American purposes. This is the backdrop for \n     two recent incidents that make us think the U.S. should \n     reconsider the ICRC's role.\n       The first concerns a story we heard first from a U.S. \n     source that an ICRC representative visiting America's largest \n     detention facility in Iraq last month had compared the U.S. \n     to Nazi Germany. According to a Defense Department source \n     citing internal Pentagon documents, the ICRC team leader told \n     U.S. authorities at Camp Bucca: ``You people are no better \n     than and no different than the Nazi concentration camp \n     guards.'' She was upset about not being granted immediate \n     access shortly after a prison riot, when U.S. commanders may \n     have been thinking of her own safety, among other \n     considerations.\n       A second, senior Defense Department source we asked about \n     the episode confirmed that the quote above is accurate. And a \n     third, very well-placed American source we contacted \n     separately told us that some kind of reference was made by \n     the Red Cross representative ``to either Nazis or the Third \n     Reich''--which understandably offended the American soldiers \n     present.\n       The world needs a truly neutral humanitarian body of the \n     sort the ICRC is supposed to be. But the Camp Bucca \n     incident--in addition to the leaked Gitmo and Abu Ghraib \n     reports--is evidence it isn't currently up to the task.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have been informed I will be asking for \nthe yeas and nays for two different amendments. I will do that after \nexplaining the second amendment.\n\n[[Page S8782]]\n\n  I know the Senator from Florida, under UC, now has 15 minutes. My \ntime is about to expire. I would ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of the remarks of the Senator from Florida, I be recognized \nto present what was amendment 1312 and now is No. 1476. And at the \nconclusion, I will be asking for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent to be recognized following the \nSenator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized for 15 \nminutes, followed by the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I want to speak on the Defense \nbill to point out a major national asset with regard to our military \npreparation. What I am about to say actually involves some subterranean \nnegotiations that are going on outside of the light of day on another \nbill, on the Energy conference bill, but it relates directly to what we \nare doing here. I want to point it out.\n  One of the great national assets we have is off the coast of Florida \ncalled restricted airspace. As you can see, off the northeast coast of \nFlorida from Cape Canaveral north all the way to Savannah, GA is a \nconsiderable bit of restricted airspace. You will also notice on this \nmap of the peninsula of Florida and the Gulf of Mexico that almost the \nentire area of the Gulf of Mexico off of the State of Florida is \nrestricted airspace. It is not any puzzle to understand when the \nAtlantic fleet, U.S. Navy training, was shut down on the island of \nVieques off of Puerto Rico, that most of that training came here to \nnorthwest Florida. Not only because of the major military facilities at \nPensacola, Whiting, Eglin Air Force Base, Tindale Air Force Base, \nwhere, by the way, we have been talking about the FA-22, the training \nfor the pilots is at Tindale Air Force Base right here. The training \nfor the pilots for all branches of Government for the new F-135, the \njoint fighter, is done at Eglin Air Force Base. Why? Because we have \nthe restricted airspace in which that training can occur and where \nland, sea, and air exercises can be coordinated. That is a major \nnational asset.\n  Alas, people, certain interests, want to come out here and drill for \noil in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. You can't be conducting these \nmilitary maneuvers, this training that is so essential to our mission \nin the Department of Defense, you can't be doing that if you have to \nworry about oil rigs on the surface of the Gulf of Mexico below. That \nis the same right over here on the east coast, a battle I had to wage \n15, 20 years ago when it was proposed to drill from Cape Hatteras, NC \nall the way south to Fort Pierce, FL. Ultimately, we won that battle \nwith the recognition by the DOD and NASA that you can't have oil rigs \nwhere you are dropping the solid rocket boosters from the space shuttle \nand where we are dropping the first stages of the expendable booster \nrockets coming out of the Cape Canaveral Air Force station.\n  We took on this fight a month or so ago when the Energy bill was here \nand we won this fight, thanks to the agreement of the chairman and the \nranking member of the Energy Committee that they would not support any \namendments that would allow drilling out here in the eastern gulf.\n  Speaking of that, just so you can see how dramatic it is that the \neastern gulf does not have this drilling, I want you to look at this \nparticular map of the gulf coast--Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, \nAlabama, Florida. You will notice the drilling, as represented by the \ngreen, is where the oil is. The geology shows that there is no drilling \nin the eastern gulf. There is no oil there. But there is another reason \nthere are not rigs there, besides the dry holes they came up with, and \nit is all of that area is restricted air space. Now, all well and good.\n  Mr. President, we have just intercepted an e-mail from the White \nHouse, and it is an e-mail sent to energy conference conferees--\nsomething that has some significance to the occupant of the chair. \nAttached is the administration's proposal. The proposal would allow for \nnew leasing activities in the eastern gulf. They define it in Louisiana \nwaters as defined by the use of seaward lateral boundaries. They go on \nin this White House e-mail to say:\n\n       Interior and the Office of Management and Budget have \n     signed off on this language.\n\n  Well, let's sound the alarms because here is what they plan to do. We \nwent through this drill a couple months ago when the Energy bill was \nhere. Why? We got the chairman of the Energy Committee and the ranking \nmember to agree to oppose these amendments--this is in the \nCongressional Record--because this line, which is the Florida-Alabama \nline, beyond which there is no leasing in any of the waters of the \ngulf, well, suddenly, they are going to draw the line of the State of \nLouisiana, which is over here, to be a line that comes out here and \ngoes into the eastern Gulf of Mexico, under the fiction that that line \nwould be the waters of Louisiana and, thus, giving a pretext to invade \nthe waters off of Florida, including the waters underneath the \nrestricted airspace, to allow oil and gas drilling.\n  The administration is pushing a proposal in the conference between \nthe House and the Senate that does not have such a provision in either \nbill. To the contrary. The House took a position against drilling in \nthe eastern gulf, and the Senate did likewise in the agreement of the \nchairman and the ranking member.\n  So I want to alert the Senate. I hope this is not going to be the \ncase because we are down to a week before everybody wants to go home \nfor the August recess and do all of their town hall meetings, and so \nforth. I know there is the interest in passing an energy conference \nbill, if they reach agreement. Clearly, I don't want to slow up the \nenergy conference bill if they reach agreement. But, of course, if the \nrepresentations and the agreements that were made in good faith are \nbroken--in fact, that were made on the floor of the Senate and are part \nof the Congressional Record--if those agreements are broken, this \nSenator from Florida will have no choice.\n  This would represent a reversal of administration policy because this \nadministration has pledged to uphold the moratorium on the Outer \nContinental Shelf from drilling until the year 2012. Although a portion \nright there is not included within the moratorium, nevertheless, the \nline they have drawn clearly includes other portions of the moratorium. \nIt is a reversal of administration policy.\n  It would also give this area, called lease-sale 181, to the State of \nLouisiana. If lease-sale 181 is part of the State of Louisiana, off of \nthe coast of Florida, then why did the administration negotiate in 2001 \nto cut back lease-sale 181 from 6 million acres to a million and a half \nacres, so it would not go over the Florida-Alabama line? There are all \nkinds of inconsistencies here. It is purely--call it what it is; it is \nan intent to drill for oil and gas off of the coast of Florida.\n  I can tell you that 18 million people in Florida don't want oil rigs \noff their shores. In the first place, the geology shows, along with \nmany dry holes, that there is not much oil and gas. In the second \nplace, we have an extraordinary $50 billion a year tourism industry \nthat depends on what? It depends on what is depicted in this picture. \nThis other picture is not what we want. This is a photograph from a \nmonth and a half ago when we had the Energy bill on this floor of 100 \npelicans that were killed as a result of an oil spill off of \nLouisiana--that is a recent photograph--and another 400 were severely \ndamaged. We don't want that. We want the other.\n  The third reason is one I had explained at the outset. This is what \nwe want for the defense of our country. We want to continue to do our \ntraining. We want all of that training that has come from Puerto Rico \nto go unhampered off of the coast of Florida, where land, sea, and air \nmilitary exercises can be coordinated without the threat of \ninterference from oil rigs below.\n  The fourth reason is the coast of Florida has something besides our \nnatural beauty and beaches. It has some of the most pristine and \necologically sensitive estuaries, rivers, and bays that come into the \ngulf. That is a very important place to keep so that the balance of \nnature can occur with the oceans.\n  For all of these reasons, I wanted to share with the Senate that I \nhope I don't have to be out here later this\n\n[[Page S8783]]\n\nweek making these speeches again because I took it at face value and in \ngood faith that the representations that were made here were going to \nstick. If they do not, then the Senator from Florida will have to judge \naccordingly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1313\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, so we can get procedurally back where we \nshould be, I ask unanimous consent that the current amendment be set \naside for the consideration of amendment No. 1313.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before the Senator brings up this matter--\nand he has the floor--I wonder if I can clarify this among my \ncolleagues, to try to accommodate others. We have Senator Dorgan to be \nrecognized under the previous unanimous consent. I understand 10 \nminutes would be sufficient there.\n  Mr. REED. Fifteen minutes, I believe.\n  Mr. WARNER. We are anxious to get going, but we will do 15 minutes. I \nsee the Senator from Colorado here. I know the Senator from Arizona and \nthe Senator from South Carolina called within the hour. They need time. \nCan the Senator advise me as to what his desires might be?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I think 10 minutes would be fine. I was \ngoing to make an argument on an amendment that will be presented. I \ndon't know where it is before us. I do have a couple of amendments I \nwould like to propose. I think for the debate on those two amendments \nand a floor statement, I probably need 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. If the Senator from Colorado could be recognized \nfollowing Senator Dorgan, I would like to reserve an hour for myself \nand Senator McCain and Senator Lindsey Graham.\n  Mr. REED. Senator Levin will need some time, also.\n  Mr. WARNER. He will certainly get that time. I ask unanimous consent \nfor that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REED. Would the Senator restate the UC?\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Oklahoma \ncontinue for about 10 minutes; Senator Dorgan for 15 minutes; the \nSenator from Colorado for 10 minutes; and 1 hour equally divided \nbetween Senators Warner, McCain, and Graham.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REED. Reserving the right to object, I just want to protect the \nability for Senator Levin to have time.\n  Mr. WARNER. He can be recognized following the hour of three of us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on amendment \nNo. 1313.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1476\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask that amendment No. 1313 be set aside \nfor the consideration of amendment No. 1476, which I send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1476.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress that the President should \n       take immediate steps to establish a plan to implement the \n  recommendations of the 2004 Report to Congress of the United States-\n             China Economic and Security Review Commission)\n\n       At the end of title XII, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1205. THE UNITED STATES-CHINA ECONOMIC AND SECURITY \n                   REVIEW COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The 2004 Report to Congress of the United States-China \n     Economic and Security Review Commission states that--\n       (A) China's State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) lack adequate \n     disclosure standards, which creates the potential for United \n     States investors to unwittingly contribute to enterprises \n     that are involved in activities harmful to United States \n     security interests;\n       (B) United States influence and vital long-term interests \n     in Asia are being challenged by China's robust regional \n     economic engagement and diplomacy;\n       (C) the assistance of China and North Korea to global \n     ballistic missile proliferation is extensive and ongoing;\n       (D) China's transfers of technology and components for \n     weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their delivery systems \n     to countries of concern, including countries that support \n     acts of international terrorism, has helped create a new tier \n     of countries with the capability to produce WMD and ballistic \n     missiles;\n       (E) the removal of the European Union arms embargo against \n     China that is currently under consideration in the European \n     Union would accelerate weapons modernization and dramatically \n     enhance Chinese military capabilities;\n       (F) China's recent actions toward Taiwan call into question \n     China's commitments to a peaceful resolution;\n       (G) China is developing a leading-edge military with the \n     objective of intimidating Taiwan and deterring United States \n     involvement in the Strait, and China's qualitative and \n     quantitative military advancements have already resulted in a \n     dramatic shift in the cross-Strait military balance toward \n     China; and\n       (H) China's growing energy needs are driving China into \n     bilateral arrangements that undermine multilateral efforts to \n     stabilize oil supplies and prices, and in some cases may \n     involve dangerous weapons transfers.\n       (2) On March 14, 2005, the National People's Congress \n     approved a law that would authorize the use of force if \n     Taiwan formally declares independence.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--\n       (1) Plan.--The President is strongly urged to take \n     immediate steps to establish a plan to implement the \n     recommendations contained in the 2004 Report to Congress of \n     the United States-China Economic and Security Review \n     Commission in order to correct the negative implications that \n     a number of current trends in United States-China relations \n     have for United States long-term economic and national \n     security interests.\n       (2) Contents.--Such a plan should contain the following:\n       (A) Actions to address China's policy of undervaluing its \n     currency, including--\n       (i) encouraging China to provide for a substantial upward \n     revaluation of the Chinese yuan against the United States \n     dollar;\n       (ii) allowing the yuan to float against a trade-weighted \n     basket of currencies; and\n       (iii) concurrently encouraging United States trading \n     partners with similar interests to join in these efforts.\n       (B) Actions to make better use of the World Trade \n     Organization (WTO) dispute settlement mechanism and \n     applicable United States trade laws to redress China's unfair \n     trade practices, including China's exchange rate \n     manipulation, denial of trading and distribution rights, lack \n     of intellectual property rights protection, objectionable \n     labor standards, subsidization of exports, and forced \n     technology transfers as a condition of doing business. The \n     United States Trade Representative should consult with our \n     trading partners regarding any trade dispute with China.\n       (C) Actions to encourage United States diplomatic efforts \n     to identify and pursue initiatives to revitalize United \n     States engagement with China's Asian neighbors. The \n     initiatives should have a regional focus and complement \n     bilateral efforts. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation \n     forum (APEC) offers a ready mechanism for pursuit of such \n     initiatives.\n       (D) Actions by the administration to hold China accountable \n     for proliferation of prohibited technologies and to secure \n     China's agreement to renew efforts to curtail North Korea's \n     commercial export of ballistic missiles.\n       (E) Actions by the Secretaries of State and Energy to \n     consult with the International Energy Agency with the \n     objective of upgrading the current loose experience-sharing \n     arrangement, whereby China engages in some limited exchanges \n     with the organization, to a more structured arrangement \n     whereby China would be obligated to develop a meaningful \n     strategic oil reserve, and coordinate release of stocks in \n     supply-disruption crises or speculator-driven price spikes.\n       (F) Actions by the administration to develop a coordinated, \n     comprehensive national policy and strategy designed to meet \n     China's challenge to maintaining United States scientific and \n     technological leadership and competitiveness in the same way \n     the administration is presently required to develop and \n     publish a national security strategy.\n       (G) Actions to review laws and regulations governing the \n     Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), \n     including exploring whether the definition of national \n     security should include the potential impact on national \n     economic security as a criterion to be reviewed, and whether \n     the chairmanship of CFIUS should be transferred from the \n     Secretary of the Treasury to a more appropriate executive \n     branch agency.\n\n[[Page S8784]]\n\n       (H) Actions by the President and the Secretaries of State \n     and Defense to press strongly their European Union \n     counterparts to maintain the EU arms embargo on China.\n       (I) Actions by the administration to discourage foreign \n     defense contractors from selling sensitive military use \n     technology or weapons systems to China. The administration \n     should provide a comprehensive annual report to the \n     appropriate committees of Congress on the nature and scope of \n     foreign military sales to China, particularly sales by Russia \n     and Israel.\n       (J) Any additional actions outlined in the 2004 Report to \n     Congress of the United States-China Economic and Security \n     Review Commission that affect the economic or national \n     security of the United States.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this amendment is similar to one that I am \nnot going to offer that was previously going to be offered, No. 1312. \nThere have been several changes made, so a new number is assigned to \nit.\n  Mr. President, in October 2000, Congress established the United \nStates-China Security Economic Review Commission to act as a bipartisan \nauthority on how our relationship with China affects our economy, \nChina's military and weapons proliferation, and our influence in Asia.\n  For the past 5 years, the Commission has been holding hearings and \nissuing annual reports to evaluate ``the national security implications \nof the bilateral trade and economic relationship with the United States \nand the People's Republic of China.'' Their job is to provide us in \nCongress with the necessary information to make decisions about the \ncomplex situation. However, I fear their reports have gone largely \nunnoticed.\n  This has been very disturbing. I have had occasion to give four \nrather lengthy speeches concerning the recommendations. I will not be \nredundant, and I certainly will not take the time I took previously, \nbut it is something that is very significant. This was a bipartisan \ncommission, made up of Democrats and Republicans, some Members of \nCongress, and some former Members of Congress. They came out with \nrecommendations over a period of years.\n  I found the recommendations of the Commission's 2004 report--this is \nthe most recent approach--objective, necessary, and urgent, and I am \noffering an amendment to express our support for these viable steps.\n  This amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that China should, \nfirst, reevaluate its manipulated currency level and allow it to float \nagainst other currencies. In the Treasury Department's recent report to \nCongress, China's monetary policies are described as ``highly \ndistortionary and pose a risk to China's economy, its trading partners, \nand global economic growth.''\n  Second, the appropriate steps ought to be taken through the World \nTrade Organization to hold China accountable for its dubious trade \npractices. Major problem issues, such as intellectual property rights, \nhave yet to be addressed.\n  Third, the United States should revitalize engagement in the Asian \nregion, broaden our interaction with organizations such as ASEAN, which \nis the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Our lack of influence \nhas been demonstrated by the Shanghai Cooperation Organization recently \ndemanding that we set a troop pullout deadline in Afghanistan. This \nclearly shows we do not have much influence there.\n  Fourth, the administration ought to hold China accountable for \nproliferating prohibited technologies. Chinese companies, such as \nNORINCO, have been sanctioned frequently and yet the Chinese Government \nrefuses to enforce their own nonproliferation agreements.\n  Fifth, the U.N. should monitor nuclear, biological, and chemical \ntreaties and either enforce these agreements or report them to the \nSecurity Council. The United States-China Commission has found that \nChina has undercut the U.N. in many areas, undermining what pressures \nwe have tried to apply on problematic states, such as Sudan and \nZimbabwe.\n  Sixth, the administration ought to review the effectiveness of the \none-China policy in relation to Taiwan to reflect the dynamic nature of \nthe situation. The Defense Department's annual report to Congress, \nreleased 2 days ago, states that China's military ``sustained buildup \naffects the status quo in the Taiwan Strait.'' We have been watching \nthis for a number of years. We have also been watching the growth and \nenhancement of China's conventional military capability. We have known \nabout their nuclear capability for some time. Now we see, as the \nSenator from Utah was mentioning a few minutes ago, that countries are \nbuying these superior strike vehicles from Russia, such as the SU-30s. \nChina, in one purchase, I understand, bought some 240. One has to stop \nand think about this. It puts them in the position to have better \nstrike vehicles than we do. Of course, we have seen the buildup, the \neffect on their relationship in the Taiwan Strait.\n  Seventh, various energy agencies should encourage China to develop \nits strategic oil reserve in order to avoid a disastrous economic \ncrisis if oil availability becomes unstable. We have to understand that \nwe have a serious problem in this country with the fact that we are \nrelying upon foreign countries for some 65 percent of the oil we \nimport. We are now starting to compete with China which has that great \nproblem, too.\n  As one travels around and looks at countries such as Iran, Sudan, \nNigeria, and other countries where they are establishing \nrelationships--we have seen what they are doing in Venezuela right \nnow--we have to recognize they are going to be our chief competition in \nbecoming self-sufficient in our ability to fight a war without \ndependency upon foreign countries.\n  Eighth, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, \ncalled CFIUS, should include national economic security as a criterion \nfor evaluation and the chairmanship to be transferred to a more \nappropriate chair allowing for increased security precautions.\n  Right now CFIUS has actually reviewed some 1,500 cases of purchases \nby foreign countries, and they have only questioned 24. They relented \non those and only stopped one. That is 1 out of 1,500. There is \nsomething wrong. We see some things that are going on right now, such \nas Unocal, that have received a lot of publicity. This is a very \nstrong recommendation. In fact, I have a separate resolution that \ncovers just this issue and this alone. It will recommend that the \nchairmanship be changed from the Secretary of Treasury to the Secretary \nof Defense.\n\n  Ninth, the administration should continue its pressure on the EU to \nmaintain its arms embargo on China. The recent Defense Department \nreport states the EU would not have the capability to monitor and \nenforce any limits if the arms embargo is lifted.\n  Tenth, penalties should be placed on foreign contractors who sell \nsensitive military use technology or weapons system to China from \nbenefiting from U.S. defense-related research development in production \nprograms. What is going on is sales are taking place to China on \ntechnology that has been subsidized by the United States. In other \nwords, we are putting ourselves in a situation where our national \nsecurity would be impaired by our own research for which we have paid.\n  Eleventh, the administration should also provide a report to Congress \non the scope of foreign military sales to China.\n  Finally, Congress should support the recommendations of the \nCommission's 2004 report to Congress. Unless our relationship with \nChina is backed up with strong action, they will never take us \nseriously. We will certainly see more violations of proliferation \ntreaties. It is happening over and over. We are looking at it right \nnow. They continue to manipulate regional global trade through currency \nundervaluation and other unhealthy practices. They will develop \nunreliable oil sources and energy alliances with countries that \nthreaten international stability. They will continue to escalate the \nsituation over Taiwan, raising the stakes in a game neither country can \nwin.\n  In today's world, we see how the unpaid bills of the past come back \nto haunt us in full. Ignoring these problems is unacceptable.\n  The United States-China Commission was created to give us in Congress \na clear picture about what is going on. They have done their job. It is \ntime for us to do our job.\n  I repeat, this is a commission that has been working now for 4 years. \nIt is a bipartisan commission. These are specific recommendations. This \namendment is a sense of the Senate to follow these recommendations.\n\n[[Page S8785]]\n\n  This is amendment No. 1476.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1312 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I withdraw amendment No. 1312.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, amendment No. 1312 is \nwithdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1476\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. We are considering amendment No. 1476. I ask for the yeas \nand nays on amendment No. 1476.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, am I now recognized for 15 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague has sought to have the yeas \nand nays on his amendment. Let me do the same. I have two amendments \npending. Should there be cloture invoked on this underlying bill, as my \ncolleague from Oklahoma has suggested, I would like my amendments to be \nconsidered prior to cloture. I have an amendment No. 1429, which is \noffered. I ask for the yeas and nays on both of my amendments. Then I \nwill speak on the amendments ever so briefly.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 1426 and 1429\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask that we consider amendment 1429. I \npreviously filed that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to make that the \nregular order. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on amendment \nNo. 1429.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we consider \namendment No. 1426, which I previously filed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator can make that the regular order. \nThe amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on amendment \nNo. 1426.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will briefly describe amendment No. \n1426. I thank my colleagues for their cooperation. That amendment one \nthat I described at some length on Friday. It has to do with the joint \ninquiry of the two Intelligence Committees into the terrorist attacks \nof September 11, 2001. It has to do with the 28 pages in this joint \ninquiry that have been redacted and classified as top secret. The \nAmerican people should see these 28 pages. The chairman and the ranking \nmember of the Intelligence Committee at the time said they believe the \nAmerican people should see these 28 pages. The Government of Saudi \nArabia said the American people deserve to see these 28 pages. This \nbook went to the White House for publication. The White House redacted \nit and classified it as top secret.\n  I have read the 28 pages. My colleagues have had an opportunity to \nread them. My former colleague from Florida, who was chairman of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee, described the question of whether the \nhijackers on 9/11--and 15 of the 19 were Saudi citizens--whether the \nhijackers received support from foreign interests and, if so, what kind \nof support, which foreign interests. The American people have a right \nto see this.\n  I hope the Senate will finally vote on asking the President to \ndeclassify these pages and give the American people the right to \nunderstand what is in those 28 pages.\n  Again, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee and the ranking \nmember, a Republican and a Democrat, believed at the time those 28 \npages should not have been classified.\n  I will now turn to amendment No. 1429. It deals with waste, fraud, \nand abuse in contracting in Iraq, and it deals especially with \nHalliburton, but not exclusively with Halliburton. I have offered this \namendment previously as well.\n  It is unbelievable to me the billions and billions of dollars being \nspent. A substantial portion of it is being wasted. We know that, and \nyet no one seems to care or do much about it.\n  Let me show some charts, if I may. This is a chart of someone who \ntestified before a policy committee hearing I held. This fellow--you \ncannot see his face--this fellow in the blue striped shirt testified. \nHe was in Iraq when this picture was taken. This is Saran-wrapped \nbundles of 100-dollar bills, some millions of dollars in 100-dollar \nbills. He said in this particular area they often played football with \nthese Saran-wrapped bundles of 100-dollar bills.\n  What was he doing with bundles of 100-dollar bills? The area where \nthis cash was stored, subcontractors in Iraq were told: Bring a bag \nbecause we pay in cash; bring a bag. Show up here and want to get paid \nfor whatever you are doing? Bring a bag because we pay in cash.\n  Let me talk for a moment about the five hearings we held. We heard \nabout cash transactions that were unrecorded, $9 billion that was \nunaccounted for. ``Uncle Sam Looks into Meal Bills: Halliburton Refunds \n$27 Million as Result.'' A company that was a Saudi subcontractor doing \nbusiness through Halliburton billed the Government for 42,000 meals a \nday, but they only served 14,000 meals to our troops. Let me say that \nagain. They were charging the Government for 42,000 meals served every \nday to our troops; they were only serving 14,000 meals.\n  This was not the first time Halliburton has been questioned about \nthis. This was in February 2004.\n  Also in February 2004, ``Halliburton Faces Criminal Investigation.''\n  They focus on efforts to solicit bids that transport fuel to Baghdad. \nPrices Halliburton charged for that work were substantially higher than \nthe cost of trucking in fuel from Turkey. Pentagon launches criminal \ninvestigation for possible fraud.\n  ``Ex-Halliburton Workers Allege Rampant Waste.'' Said one employee: \nThey did not control costs at all. Their motto was do not worry about \ncosts. It is cost plus.\n  Henry Bunting--who testified, incidentally, before one of our Policy \nCommittee hearings--said that they spent $7,500 a month to rent \nordinary vehicles, cars and trucks, when the vehicles could have been \nrented for less than $2,000 a month through the Internet. He also held \nup some towels. He said they had purchased monogrammed towels for \n$7.50--these are hand towels for the troops--that should have cost \n$2.50. Why $7.50? Because Halliburton wanted their logo on the towels.\n  Now it is May. In February, they talked about overcharging 42,000 \nmeals when they only served 14,000 meals. Now it is May of last year, 4 \nmonths later, and the Pentagon says: We are suspending $159 million in \nmeal charges to Halliburton for feeding soldiers because the fact is \nthey were charging for meals they were not serving.\n  They are still engaged in the same contract, still cheating, and \nnobody does a thing about it.\n  ``Millions in U.S. Property Lost.'' Halliburton lost $18.6 million in \nGovernment property in Iraq. Auditors could not account for 6,975 items \non the ledgers of Halliburton's unit.\n  ``Halliburton is Unable to Prove $1.8 Billion in Work, Pentagon \nSays.'' This has gone on and on. Has Congress done a thing about it, \nany oversight hearings? None. Nobody seems to care much.\n  Let me read from a hearing we held in the Policy Committee, a hearing \nwe held because the oversight committees do not hold these hearings. \nLet me read what the top civilian in the Corps of Engineers, who is \nengaged in these contracts and approves these contracts, said. This is \na woman named Bunnatine Greenhouse. She rose to the highest level in \nthe Corps of Engineers for civilian employees, and now she is losing \nher job because she was honest. Here is what she said: I can \nunequivocally state that the abuse related to\n\n[[Page S8786]]\n\ncontracts awarded to Halliburton represents the most blatant and \nimproper contract abuse I have witnessed during the course of my \nprofessional career.\n  This courageous lady comes forward to testify to say these things, \nand now her career pays a price for it because we do not want to upset \nthe good old boy network around here. They want to give a sweetheart \ndeal to a company, suspend the rules, and give a sweetheart deal. They \ncheat you, cheat you again and again, do not worry about it. Do a \nlittle investigation down at the Pentagon, but don't anybody in \nCongress call attention to it. It would be uncomfortable and \nembarrassing to somebody.\n  In 1941, Harry Truman, the Senator from Missouri, served in this \nChamber. He was a flinty, tough independent. A member of his own party \nwas in the White House, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. A Democrat in the \nSenate took on the task of identifying the waste, abuse, and fraud that \nwas occurring in spending on our defense. They held hearing after \nhearing, and they unearthed a massive amount of fraud, waste, and \nabuse. I am sure that was uncomfortable for the Democrat in the White \nHouse, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, because a Democrat Senator was \nleading the fight. He did it through the Truman Committee that took a \nhard look at this kind of fraud and abuse.\n  My amendment would reestablish a Truman-type committee, with Members \nof both parties on it. When we are shoving tens of billions of dollars \nout the door to companies such as Halliburton in sole-source contracts, \nsomebody has to watch the cash register.\n  We had a fellow named Rory testify recently at the Policy Committee. \nAgain, we are holding hearings only because there are not aggressive \noversight hearings held in the rest of the Congress because the \nmajority party worries it would embarrass somebody. So Rory comes to \ntestify. He is running a food service unit for Halliburton in Iraq and \nhe says: We are getting food that is in some cases over a year expired \non the date stamp for the food. What do they do? They are told: Feed it \nto the troops.\n  We get food that comes in on a convoy that has been attacked. What do \nthey do? The supervisors say go into those trucks and remove the \nshrapnel and remove the bullets and save the bullets as souvenirs for \nthe Halliburton supervisors and feed the food to the troops.\n  Yes, this fellow ran one of those agencies. Here is what he said: \nWhen I was an employee for Halliburton and they were doing this sort of \nthing, we were told if a Government auditor comes around, do not dare \ntalk to the Government auditor. If you do, one of two things will \nhappen: You will either be sent to a fire zone in Iraq, one under \nattack, one with significantly more danger than where you work now, or \nyou will be fired summarily. Do not talk to Government auditors.\n  The question is: When will someone care enough to begin to take a \nhard look at the money we are spending? Nearly $200 billion has gone \nout of here, all of it emergency funding, none of it paid for. A \nsubstantial portion of that goes to contractors and much of it sole-\nsource contractors, no-bid and cost-plus contracts. The American \ntaxpayers, in my judgment, are paying the price for very substantial \nabuse and very substantial waste and fraud.\n  The moment someone comes to the Senate floor and mentions the word \n``Halliburton,'' they say: You are attacking the Vice President. I am \nnot. The Vice President used to run Halliburton Corporation. He does \nnot and has not since the year 2000. None of the examples I have cited \nhave happened prior to that time, they have happened since that time. \nThis is not the Vice President's corporation. It is not on his watch as \nCEO of Halliburton. But these are sweetheart contracts, sole-source \ncontracts.\n  Fifty thousand pounds of nails are ordered to the country of Iraq, \nand they are the wrong size. So if one wants some nails, they are \nlaying on the ground somewhere there in the sand, just another piece of \nwaste. Seventy-five hundred dollars to rent a vehicle for a month. Buy \nnew trucks for $85,000, get a flat tire, leave them by the roadside to \nbe trashed. Buy new trucks for $85,000 and have a fuel pump plugged, \nleave them by the roadside to be trashed and looted. All of that comes \nfrom testimony from people who used to work for Halliburton. They have \ncome before our Policy Committee and told these stories that describe \noutrageous amounts of waste, fraud, and abuse. The question is: Why \ndoes no one in this Congress seem to care? My hope is that this \nCongress would agree to create a Truman-type committee, a committee of \nRepublicans and Democrats that would take a hardnosed, flinty look at \nhow money is being spent.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, some of my colleagues have said they would \nlike a vote on their amendments prior to cloture. My hope is that we \nwill not have a cloture vote, by the way. I think the best Defense \nauthorization bills that we have had in the Congress have been those \nthat have been debated on the Senate floor for a week or two where we \nhave had a substantial opportunity to think through and debate \nsignificant and difficult issues. So I would hope we will not have a \ncloture vote tomorrow. If in fact we do, I will join my colleague from \nOklahoma and others who suggest that I would like a vote prior to \ncloture because his amendments and mine would fall postcloture. That is \none of the dilemmas of cloture.\n  Clearly, my amendment deals with something that is very important, \nthat attends to the money we are spending on defense and the money we \nare going to authorize to be spent on defense, but because of the way \nit is written and the subject, it will fall postcloture. For that \nreason, I hope we will not invoke cloture tomorrow.\n\n  I thank my colleagues for the time and hope they will seriously \nconsider both amendments I have described today.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank our colleague. It will be given careful \nconsideration. It relates to an important subject matter.\n  I understand the Senator from Colorado has about 10 minutes, followed \nby Senators McCain, Graham, and Warner for 1 hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the chairman for yielding me 10 minutes.\n  There are three amendments that I have offered and I would like to \nask for their consideration, and then I wish to make some comments \nrelating to one of them and then finally some comments on the Levin \nmissile defense amendment offered earlier today.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1419\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that we set aside the pending amendment, and \nI ask for the consideration of amendment No. 1419.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I ask for the yeas and nays on that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1383\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent to lay aside \nthat amendment, and I ask for the consideration of amendment No. 1383. \nThat amendment has been previously filed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Allard] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1383.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To establish a program for the management of post-project \n completion retirement benefits for employees at Department of Energy \n                       project completion sites)\n\n       On page 378, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 3114.

and\n       ``(B) the Secretary of the Interior shall--\n       ``(i) accept the transfer of the land; and\n       ``(ii) manage the land as part of the refuge.''.\n       (c) Funding.--Of the amounts authorized to be appropriated \n     to the Secretary for the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology \n     Site for fiscal year 2006, $10,000,000 shall be made \n     available to the Secretary for the purposes described in \n     subsection (b).\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, No. 1506 deals with the mineral rights at \nRocky Flats. This basically will provide for the Secretary to purchase \nthese mineral rights. There is money that has been provided for this in \nprevious legislation and that is pending. This allows for the transfer \nof those mineral rights on Rocky Flats. It is based on the owner of the \nmineral rights being willing to sell.\n  In 2001, I successfully inserted a provision in the National Defense \nauthorization bill that authorized the creation of the Rocky Flats \nNational Wildlife Refuge. Under this legislation, the Department of \nEnergy was required to transfer most of the Rocky Flats Environmental \nTechnology Site to the Department of Interior for the purposes of \ncreating a wildlife refuge to preserve Colorado's rare Front Range \nhabitat.\n  Earlier, 2 months ago, the Departments of Energy and Interior signed \na memorandum of understanding that stipulated how and when the \nDepartment of Energy would transfer the management of most of the Rocky \nFlats Environmental Technology Site to the Department of Interior. \nHowever, this memorandum of understanding was incomplete. It completely \ndeferred the issue of the disruptive surface mining of privately owned \nmineral rights that is occurring on the site until later this year. \nThis deferral did not meet the legislation requirement under the Rocky \nFlats National Wildlife Refuge Act and represented a critical \nimpediment to the closure of Rocky Flats.\n  The Department of Interior contended that surface mining such as that \nnow occurring at Rocky Flats is fundamentally contrary to its refuge \nmanagement goals, and makes the achievement of refuge purposes on those \nlands impossible.\n  To better understand this issue, I requested that the Department of \nEnergy hire an independent contractor to conduct an appraisal on the \nvalue of the mineral rights. The independent contractor determined the \nowners and provided a preliminary cost estimate as to the fair market \nvalue of those mineral rights containing sand and gravel.\n  After the appraisal was completed, my staff personally contacted each \nmineral rights owner. I wanted to see if they would be interested in \nselling if they were offered money for the fair market value of the \nmineral rights. I also reassured them that the owners would not be \nforced to sell if they didn't want to.\n  Shortly thereafter, it was brought to my attention that the purchase \nof mineral rights could be included as part of a comprehensive natural \nresource damage settlement. I am pleased to announce that the State of \nColorado, my colleague from Colorado, Senator Salazar, and I have \nworked out legislation providing for such an arrangement. I am \nconfidant that this arrangement will be acceptable to the Department of \nEnergy and the Department of Interior.\n  Under the amendment I am introducing today, the Secretary of Energy \nwill be required to purchase essential mineral rights necessary to \ntransition Rocky Flats to a national wildlife refuge.\n  The Secretary can only purchase these mineral rights once the \nfollowing conditions are met: (1) The owner of the minieral right is a \nwilling seller; (2) the Secretary purchases the mineral right at fair \nmarket value; and (3) the Trustees for Rocky Flats release the \nDepartment from its natural resource damage liabilities under the \nComprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act \nof 1980, CERCLA.\n  Also included in this legislation is a provision that states that if \nthe owner of the mineral right refuses to sell, the Secretary of Energy \nmay satisfy the Department's natural resource liability obligation by \npaying the trustees of the site an amount equal to the fair market \nvalue of the mineral right owned by the unwilling seller.\n  I believe this amendment makes too much sense for us to pass up. We \nhave winners, winners, and winners. It is certainly a win for the State \nof Colorado--the State mechanism that would provide more dollars for \nColorado than most likely would have been gained through the normal \nnatural resources damages settlement process. The owners of the mineral \nrights win because they now have an opportunity to sell their mineral \nrights at fair market value, a possibility that never existed before. \nThe Department of Energy wins because it is able to pay off its natural \nresource damage liabilities that would have arisen under the \nComprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act \nof 1980. The Department of Interior wins because this legislation would \nremove the last impediment to the memorandum of understanding between \nInterior and the Department of Energy so that Interior can move forward \nwith creating a wildlife refuge at Rocky Flats. Most importantly, the \npeople of Colorado win because now they will be able to enjoy the \npristine beauty and splendor of the Rocky Mountain's Front Range \nthrough the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge. Hundreds of acres of \nrare xeric tallgrass prairie will be preserved. The natural wildlife in \nthe refuge will be protected.\n\n  As I said, this is a win-win proposal. Everyone gains. I urge my \ncolleagues to support my amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1492\n\n  I rise in opposition to the Levin missile defense amendment. This \namendment eliminates $30 million--there has been $50 million \nrequested--for long-lead funding for ground-based interceptor missiles \n31-40 and $20 million for associated silo construction. The $50 million \nwould be used to plus-up the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program which \nis already fully funded at $415.5 million, with an additional $1.6 \nbillion for DOE nonproliferation programs.\n\n[[Page S8789]]\n\n  The CTR currently has $500 million in unobligated funds for 2005. So \nI would hope we could keep these provisions in the current \nauthorization bill.\n  DOD already directed a $1 billion reduction in MDA funding in fiscal \nyear 2006 and $5 billion in 2006 through 2011. To add upon that an \nadditional reduction in long-term funding puts this program in \njeopardy. We need to have those long-term plans in place, funded, \nbecause they are very important to the security of this Nation.\n\n  This amendment would unnecessarily delay the fielding of ground-based \ninterceptors in 2009 and 2010. We simply cannot afford such a delay \nbecause the threat is ``real and imminent,'' as General Cartwright has \ntestified. The CIA and DIA assess North Korea as ready to flight test \nan ICBM that can reach the United States, and Iran may have such a \ncapability in 2015, according to the DIA.\n  A production break, by the way, would cost $270 million to restart, \nso there is a cost in delaying these funds.\n  Despite recent test failures, the technology is mature enough to \nproceed with fielding even though we continue to test and improve \nreliability.\n  STRATCOM, the Director of Operational Tests and Evaluation, and the \nIndependent Review Team agree that the ground-based midcourse defense \ntest bed has some limited capability. The Independent Review Team also \nfound no fundamental design flaws with the GMD system, and that we need \nto concentrate on manufacturing quality control.\n  I happen to be in favor of more operational testing. The MDA is \npursuing a prudent approach by delaying further testing until \nreliability issues are addressed. Four flight tests were scheduled for \n2006, starting in October and ending with an intercept next September. \nAlso, the SASC adopted the Nelson amendment that directs increasing \ncooperation between independent testing agencies and MDA, and calls for \nmore operationally realistic testing that will be evaluated by the \nDirector of Operational Test and Evaluation.\n  I have been out to visit the southern parts of the test bed. I am \nconvinced our technology is there. I am convinced the threat is real. \nAs a result, I think we need to move forward and we need to move \nforward in a long-term way so the manufacturers who provide the \nmissiles and technology for the program have some reliable source of \nrevenue as we move forward. We should not interrupt the program. The \nagencies that are responsible for administering the program need to \nhave that funding there so they can continue to plan in the future for \nthe defense of this country.\n  There is an emerging threat. There is a threat that continues to \nemerge, I would say, from North Korea. I think we have to be concerned \nabout Iran.\n  I have always been a strong proponent of missile defense. I think \nthis particular amendment that Senator Levin has introduced tends to \nmake it difficult for us to meet our long-range goals, to protect the \nborders of this country, and protect the American people from some type \nof missile attack. In today's environment, it is important that we have \nthat insurance for the future of America.\n  I wanted to make the comments on the Levin amendment because I think \nit is ill-advised in light of the state of the world today.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the \nchairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, under the unanimous consent requirement, \nSenator McCain, Senator Graham, and I are now recognized for an hour. I \nask our distinguished colleague from Arizona--I would like to amend \nthat to allow Senator Salazar to go for 2 minutes. I request that \nunanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1506\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Arizona, also my \nfriend from Virginia, and my friend from Rhode Island for agreeing to \nlet me speak for a couple of minutes on this amendment.\n  The amendment both Senator Allard and I are proposing, amendment No. \n1506, is very important as we move forward with the Department of \nEnergy complex. We have created a great model for the rest of our \ncountry as to how we clean up the remnants of the Cold War. How we do \nthis in an appropriate fashion to bring the cleanup of Rocky Flats to \ncompletion is a very important part of our Nation's efforts to clean up \nthese facilities.\n  Amendment No. 1506 is a great step in the right direction because it \nwill help us bring to conclusion, in a final form, the cleanup at Rocky \nFlats. I commend my colleague from Colorado, Senator Allard, for his \nleadership on this effort over the years. I also commend him and both \nof our staffs for having worked out the issues with the Department of \nEnergy and Department of Interior over the weekend.\n  I also want to inform my colleagues that I have had a hold on four \nnominees who had been passed out of the committee, out of the Energy \nCommittee. I am lifting the holds on Jill Sigal, David Hill, James \nRispoli, and Thomas Weimer so that they can move forward and hopefully \nbe confirmed by the Senate before we get into the August recess.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we now turn to the three Senators. I would \nlike to take 1 minute to address both Colorado Senators.\n  I followed with interest your amendments. I do hope we now have on \nthe record a clear statement of support by the Secretary of Energy. Am \nI correct in that?\n  Mr. ALLARD. As I have discussed with the Chairman's staff--I assume \nyou are talking about the amendment on the mineral rights.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. That provision is before the OMB, so I cannot publicly \nstate their position until we get a decision back from OMB.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator.\n  Now, Mr. President, we would like to commence the 1 hour. I yield the \nfloor so Senator McCain can gain recognition. But I would want to say \nthis is a subject that is enormously important. I commend Senator \nMcCain and Senator Graham. It merits the full attention and hopefully \nthe support of the Senate. These are issues that go far beyond just the \nquestion of detention. It goes to the perception of the great Nation of \nwhich we are privileged to be citizens, the United States of America, \nas it relates to how we treat those people who come into our custody in \nthe course of defending freedom, on battle fields, and elsewhere in the \nworld. I have such great respect for Senator McCain.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1557, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto modify my amendment No. 1557, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask the pending amendment be set aside, \nand I call up amendment No. 1557, which is at the desk. I ask the clerk \ncontinue the reading of the amendment because it is short and \nimportant.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself, Mr. \n     Warner, Mr. Graham, and Ms. Collins, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1557, as modified:\n\n       At the end of subtitle G of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1073. UNIFORM STANDARDS FOR THE INTERROGATION OF PERSONS \n                   UNDER THE DETENTION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF \n                   DEFENSE.\n\n       (a) Limitation on Interrogation Techniques.--\n       (1) In general.--No person in the custody or under the \n     effective control of the Department of Defense or under \n     detention in a Department of Defense facility shall be \n     subject to any treatment or technique of interrogation not \n     authorized by and listed in the United States Army Field \n     Manual on Intelligence Interrogation.\n       (2) Applicability.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply to with \n     respect to any person in the custody or under the effective \n     control of the Department of Defense pursuant to a criminal \n     law or immigration law of the United States.\n\n[[Page S8790]]\n\n       (3) Construction.--Nothing in this subsection shall be \n     construed to affect the rights under the United States \n     Constitution of any person in the custody or under the \n     physical jurisdiction of the United States.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I asked that amendment be read because \nthere may be various interpretations of what this amendment is and what \nit means. What it means to the sponsors--and I am grateful to my \nfriend, Senator Warner, the distinguished chairman of the committee, \nand Senator Graham and others, including Senator Collins and others who \nhave supported this. Basically, it says the U.S. Army Field Manual on \nIntelligence Interrogation shall be the document that governs \ninterrogation of prisoners who are under Department of Defense custody.\n  Some of us may like to see this expanded to treatment of prisoners \nwho are under custody of different agencies of Government. This applies \nto the Department of Defense.\n  Before I proceed further, I ask my friend from Virginia--as he knows, \nwe have two amendments. One is this one which we have just read, and \nthe other one concerning cruel and inhumane treatment, which we are \nsort of still working on. Is it the desire of the Chairman we take up \nboth amendments at this time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I suggest we take up the other one--you \nand I have discussed it--as soon as the other one is completed because \nI am a cosponsor on the one that is now pending.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the distinguished chairman. For the information \nof my colleagues, the second amendment, which would be before the \nSenate for consideration at a different time, basically says that cruel \nand inhumane treatment will not be inflicted upon any prisoner, and we \nwould adhere to the Geneva Conventions as well as other international \nagreements concerning the treatment of prisoners.\n  But on this issue it says this amendment would prohibit cruel and \ninhumane and degrading treatment of prisoners in the detention of the \nU.S. Government, and it is basically fairly straightforward and simple, \nas I read.\n  The Army Field Manual and its various editions have served America \nwell, through wars against both regular and irregular foes. The manual \nembodies the values Americans have embraced for generations while \npreserving the ability of our interrogators to extract critical \nintelligence from ruthless foes. Never has this been more important \nthan today in the midst of the war on terror.\n  I think we all agree to fight terrorism we must obtain intelligence. \nBut we have to ensure that it is reliable and acquired in a way that is \nhumane. To do otherwise not only offends our national morals but \nundermines our efforts to protect the Nation's security.\n  Abuse of prisoners harms--harms, not helps--us in the war on terror \nbecause inevitably these abuses become public. When they do, the cruel \nactions of a few darken the reputation of our honorable country in the \neyes of millions. Mistreatment of our prisoners also endangers U.S. \nservicemembers who might be captured by the enemy--if not in this war, \nthen in the next.\n  I want to emphasize to some of my friends who say that we should do \nanything that is necessary to extract intelligence, No. 1, torture \ndoesn't work; No. 2, if extraneous or extraordinary actions have to be \ntaken--and there may be cases, and we will get into this in the next \namendment, where someone has information that it is believed poses an \nimmediate threat to the United States--then I would suppose that it \nwould be entirely appropriate, under law, that the President of the \nUnited States could make that judgment and take whatever actions are \nnecessary. In the meantime, the Army Field Manual authorizes \ninterrogation techniques that are proven effective in extracting \nlifesaving information from the most hardened prisoners. It also \nrecognizes that torture and cruel treatment are ineffective methods \nbecause they induce prisoners to say what their interrogators want to \nhear, even if it is not true.\n  It is consistent with our laws and, most importantly, our values. Our \nvalues are different from those of our enemies. When colleagues or \nothers may come on this floor and say: Well, they do it, others do it, \nal-Qaida does it, other nations in the world do it, what differentiates \nus, the United States of America, from other countries is the fact that \nwe do not. We do not abuse human rights. We do not do it. I would argue \nthe pictures, terrible pictures from Abu Ghraib, harmed us--not only in \nthe Arab world, which is an area of great concern but it also harmed us \ndramatically amongst friendly nations, the Europeans, many of our \nallies.\n  Of course, they were appalled. Of course, we were all appalled. As we \ngo through this later on, there were interesting exchanges between the \ncivilian general counsel in the Pentagon and the military judge \nadvocate general's--members of the judge advocate general, who were \ndeeply concerned about regulations that were proposed for adoption, and \nexhibited very serious and fundamental concerns. For a short period of \ntime, unfortunately, those objections by the uniform lawyers in the \nPentagon were overruled, and we went through a period of time--thank \nGod only a few months--where interrogation techniques were allowed \nwhich were then repealed, I am happy to say.\n\n  Our friends in London and elsewhere find themselves confronting the \nsame evil that we do. Preserving the common values we hold dear is more \nimportant than ever. We fight not just to preserve our lives and \nliberties but our morals, and we will never allow the terrorists to \ntake those from us. In this war that we must win--that we will win--we \nshould never fight evil with evil.\n  As I said, the amendment I am offering would establish the Army Field \nManual as the standard for interrogation of all detainees held in \nDepartment of Defense custody. The manual has been developed by the \nexecutive branch for its own uses, with a new edition written to take \ninto account the needs of the war on terror for the new classified \nannexes due to be issued soon.\n  The advantage of setting a standard for interrogation based on the \nfield manual is to cut down on the significant level of confusion that \nstill exists with respect to which interrogation techniques are \nallowed. Two weeks ago, the Committee on Armed Services held hearings, \nunder the chairmanship of Senator Lindsey Graham, with a slew of high-\nlevel Defense Department officials from regional commanders to judge \nadvocate generals from the various branches to the Department's deputy \ngeneral counsel.\n  A chief topic of discussion was what specific interrogation \ntechniques are permitted, in what environment, with which DOD \ndetainees, by whom and when. The answers included a whole lot of \nconfusion. We got a bunch of contradictory answers. Several: I would \nhave to take a look at that. A few: Let me get back to you.\n  Let's think about that for a second. If at the highest level of the \nPentagon they do not know what exact techniques are allowed and what \naren't, what is going on in the prisons? What is going on with the \nsoldiers, the sergeant, the corporal, those who are supposed to do the \nactual interrogations? What we are trying to do is make sure there are \nclear and exact standards set for interrogation of prisoners which have \nheld for other wars and are now being updated to take into \nconsideration the kind of war that we are in.\n  Confusion results in the kind of messes that once again could give \nAmerica a black eye around the world. We need a clear, simple, and \nconsistent standard. We will have it in the Army Field Manual on \ninterrogation. That is not my opinion but that of many more \ndistinguished military legal minds than mine.\n  I received a letter recently from a group of people, 11 former high-\nranking military officers, including RADM John Hutson and RADM Don \nGuter, who each served as the Navy's top JAG, and Claudia Kennedy, who \nwas Deputy Chief of Staff for Army Intelligence. These and other \ndistinguished officers believe that the abuses took place in part \nbecause our soldiers received ambiguous instructions which, in some \ncases, authorized treatment that went beyond what the Field Manual \nallows and that had the Manual been followed across the board we could \nhave avoided the prisoner abuse scandal.\n  I am not sure we could have, Mr. President, but wouldn't any of us \nhave done whatever we could to have prevented that?\n\n[[Page S8791]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent this letter, dated July 22, 2005, be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 22, 2005.\n       Dear Senator McCain: We strongly support your proposed \n     amendments to the Defense Department Authorization bill \n     concerning detainee policy, including requiring all \n     interrogations of detainees in DOD custody to conform to the \n     U.S. Army's Field Manual on Intelligence Interrogation (FM \n     34-52), and prohibiting the use of torture and cruel, inhuman \n     and degrading treatment by any U.S. government agency.\n       The abuse of prisoners hurts America's cause in the war on \n     terror, endangers U.S. service members who might be captured \n     by the enemy, and is anathema to the values Americans have \n     held dear for generations. For many years, those values have \n     been embodied in the Army Field Manual. The Manual applies \n     the wisdom and experience gained by military interrogators in \n     conflicts against both regular and irregular foes. It \n     authorizes techniques that have proven effective in \n     extracting life-saving information from the most hardened \n     enemy prisoners. It also recognizes that torture and cruel \n     treatment are ineffective methods, because they induce \n     prisoners to say what their interrogators want to hear, even \n     if it is not true, while bringing discredit upon the United \n     States.\n       It is now apparent that the abuse of prisoners in Abu \n     Ghraib, Guantanamo and elsewhere took place in part because \n     our men and women in uniform were given ambiguous \n     instructions, which in some cases authorized treatment that \n     went beyond what was allowed by the Army Field Manual. \n     Administration officials confused matters further by \n     declaring that U.S. personnel are not bound by longstanding \n     prohibitions of cruel treatment when interrogating non-U.S. \n     citizens on foreign soil. As a result, we suddenly had one \n     set of rules for interrogating prisoners of war, and another \n     for ``enemy combatants;'' one set for Guantanamo, and another \n     for Iraq; one set for our military, and another for the CIA. \n     Our service members were denied clear guidance, and left to \n     take the blame when things went wrong. They deserve better \n     than that.\n       The United States should have one standard for \n     interrogating enemy prisoners that is effective, lawful, and \n     humane. Fortunately, America already has the gold standard in \n     the Army Field Manual. Had the Manual been followed across \n     the board, we would have been spared the pain of the prisoner \n     abuse scandal. It should be followed consistently from now \n     on. And when agencies other than DOD detain and interrogate \n     prisoners, there should be no legal loopholes permitting \n     cruel or degrading treatment.\n       The amendments proposed by Senator McCain would achieve \n     these goals while preserving our nation's ability to fight \n     the war on terror. They reflect the experience and highest \n     traditions of the United States military. We urge the \n     Congress to support this effort.\n       General Joseph Hoar (Ret.

I read from the letter:\n\n       We strongly support your proposed amendments to the Defense \n     Department Authorization bill concerning detainee policy, \n     including requiring all interrogations of detainees in DOD \n     custody to conform to the U.S. Army's Field Manual on \n     Intelligence Interrogation (FM 34-52), and prohibiting the \n     use of torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment by \n     any U.S. government agency.\n       It is now apparent that the abuse of prisoners in Abu \n     Ghraib, Guantanamo and elsewhere took place in part because \n     our men and women in uniform were given ambiguous \n     instructions, which in some cases authorized treatment that \n     went beyond what was allowed by the Army Field Manual. \n     Administration officials confused matters further by \n     declaring that U.S. personnel are not bound by longstanding \n     prohibitions of cruel treatment when interrogating non-U.S. \n     citizens on foreign soil.

And when agencies other than\n\n[[Page S8792]]\n\n     DOD detain and interrogate prisoners, there should be no \n     legal loopholes permitting cruel or degrading treatment.\n\n  This is signed by GEN Joseph Hoar, LTG Robert Gard, LTG Claudia \nKennedy, MG Melvyn Montano, RADM Don Guter, RADM John Hutson, BG David \nBrahms, BG James Cullen, BG Evelyn Foote, BG David Irvine, BG Richard \nO'Meara, et cetera, and all of these people, including General Hoar, \nserved as Commander in Chief United States Central Command. These are \nvery credible people. If we had chosen, we could have gotten many more \nsignatories to this amendment.\n  We are Americans. We hold ourselves to humane standards of treatment \nno matter how terribly evil or awful they may be. To do otherwise \nundermines our security, and it also undermines our greatness as a \nnation. We are not simply any other country. We stand for a lot more \nthan that in the world: a moral mission, one of freedom and democracy \nand human rights at home and abroad.\n  We are better than the terrorists, and we will win because we are \nbetter than they are. The enemy we fight has no respect for human life \nor human rights. They don't deserve our sympathy. But this is not about \nwho they are--it is not about who they are. It is about who we are. \nThese are values that distinguish us from our enemies.\n  President Bush understands that the war on terror is ultimately a \nbattle of ideas, a battle we will win by spreading and standing firmly \nfor the values of decency, democracy, and the rule of law. I stand with \nhim in this commitment. By applying to ourselves the basic standards we \nrightly preach to others, I believe we will only increase our \neffectiveness as the world's ultimate champion of liberty.\n  I thank Senator Warner and Senator Graham and others who have shown \nan interest. Senator Warner has had a series of hearings for a long \nperiod of time. I believe we can do a great service for the military \nand for the country if we adopt this simple two-paragraph amendment \nthat basically says that prisoners will be treated according to the \nArmy Field Manual, which, by the way, is the tradition of treatment of \nprisoners for many wars.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend Senator McCain. I have been \nprivileged to know him ever since I was Secretary of Navy in the \nclosing years of the war in Vietnam. I know no military family that has \nserved our Nation with greater distinction than the McCain family. This \nis a subject about which my dear friend has knowledge that none of us \npossess. I have absolute confidence they are doing the right thing.\n  The two of us do have some technical differences of opinion. His \namendment is predicated on the Army Field Manual which he mentioned is \nbeing revised. The current Army Field Manual basically dealt with \nState-sponsored conflict. I have every reason to believe that the \nfollow-on manual, in due course, presumably in both classified and \nunclassified form, will be completed.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1566\n\n  There is another approach here. I ask unanimous consent, if it is \nagreeable, to set the McCain amendment aside temporarily and ask \namendment 1566 be brought up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. And in no way do I wish it to substitute for Senator \nMcCain's amendment. This is a complicated subject.\n  Essentially, my amendment simply says it will be the Secretary of \nDefense that will establish uniform standards and procedures for two \nseparable subjects, detention and interrogation.\n  While I have not had a chance to go through in detail the Army's \nField Manual, I am not sure there is the emphasis placed on the \ndetention rule in such a manner as equivalent to the detention and \nregulation that will be and is on the interrogation. Those responsible \nfor detention are often quite different than those responsible for \ninterrogation. If there is any mistreatment in the course of the \ndetention, depending on the timing between such treatment and the \nfollow-on interrogation, it seems to me we have a problem.\n  Therefore, my amendment entrusts to the Secretary of Defense the task \nto put together basically all of the objectives as enunciated by my \ndistinguished friend from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia, [Mr. Warner], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1566.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide for uniform standards and procedures for the \n   interrogation of persons under the detention of the Department of \n                                Defense)\n\n       At the end of subtitle G of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1073. UNIFORM STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES FOR TREATMENT OF \n                   PERSONS UNDER DETENTION BY THE DEPARTMENT OF \n                   DEFENSE.\n\n       (a) Uniform Standards and Procedures Required.--The \n     Secretary of Defense shall establish uniform standards and \n     procedures for the detention and interrogation of persons in \n     the custody or under the control of the Department of \n     Defense.\n       (b) Consistency With Law and Treaty Obligations.--The \n     standards and procedures established under subsection (a) \n     shall be consistent with United States law and international \n     treaty obligations.\n       (c) Applicability.--\n       (1) In general.--The standards and procedures established \n     under subsection (a) shall apply to all detention and \n     interrogation activities involving persons in the custody or \n     under the control of the Department of Defense, and to such \n     activities conducted within facilities controlled by the \n     Department of Defense, regardless of whether such activities \n     are conducted by Department of Defense personnel, Department \n     of Defense contractor personnel, or personnel or contractor \n     personnel of any other department, agency, or element of the \n     United States Government.\n       (2) Exception.--The standards and procedures established \n     under subsection (a) shall not apply with respect to any \n     person in the custody or under the control of the Department \n     of Defense pursuant to a criminal law or immigration law of \n     the United States.\n       (d) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall affect \n     such rights, if any, under the Constitution of the United \n     States of any person in the custody or under the control of \n     the Department of Defense.\n       (e) Notice to Congress of Revision.--Not later than 60 days \n     before issuing any revision to the standards and procedures \n     established under subsection (a), the Secretary of Defense \n     shall notify, in writing, the congressional defense \n     committees of such revision.\n       (f) Deadline.--The standards and procedures required by \n     subsection (a) shall be established not later than 60 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. There are considerable parallels between the two \namendments, with the exception that the subject should be adjusted to \nthe Secretary of Defense. He may well designate the Army Field Manual \nas his work product, but then I would need, under the amendment, the \nassurance that equal emphasis is put on the detention phase as well as \nthe interrogation phase.\n  Recent history has shown we must have uniform standards for detention \nand interrogation across the Department of Defense. We cannot have \ndifferent standards for different theaters.\n  Soldiers, as Senator McCain pointed out, have to be trained and well \nunderstand the rules and regulations as they relate to both detention \nand interrogation. That is the goal of the McCain amendment. I \nwholeheartedly support it. It is best to entrust the entire subject to \nthe Secretary of Defense and hold him accountable, as opposed to the \ndesignation of the specific document which is in the process of being \nchanged.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1557, As Modified\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate return to \nconsideration of the McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, seeing our other colleague, Senator \nGraham, I yield the floor. But I also see Senator McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1566\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have a brief comment on the chairman's \namendment. Leaving it in the hands of the Secretary of Defense is what \ncaused the huge amount of problems we have today.\n  I have here--in fact, thanks to the tenacity of the Senator from \nSouth Carolina--finally, after a year and a half, 2 years, the \nmemoranda that were submitted by the uniformed JAGS when\n\n[[Page S8793]]\n\nthe rules for the treatment of prisoners were set up the first time, I \nsay to my friend from Virginia. They all objected to it. They were \noverruled by the Secretary of Defense and the general counsel.\n  So now, if I understand it, the amendment of my dear friend from \nVirginia is going to return that to the Secretary of Defense. I urge \nhim to read these memoranda which we finally got thanks to, again, the \nSenator from South Carolina: treating OEF detainees inconsistently with \nthe Conventions; arguably lowers the bar for the treatment of U.S. POWs \nin future conflicts, even when nations agree with the President's \nstatus determination. Many would view the more extreme interrogation \ntechniques as violative of international law, other treaties, or \ncustomary international law; perhaps violative of their own domestic \nlaw. This puts the interrogators and the chain of command at risk of \ncriminal accusations abroad, either in foreign domestic courts or \ninternational fora, to include the ICC.\n  I remind my colleagues, these are the memoranda that were sent to \ncomment on the Secretary of Defense guidelines for interrogations of \nprisoners, which were overruled. And then, a couple months later, they \nwere rescinded.\n  So in all due respect, my friend from Virginia has a degree of \nconfidence in the Secretary of Defense which, frankly, is not validated \nby what took place and many argue is one of the reasons why we had Abu \nGhraib.\n  So I thank my colleague and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I could reply to my good friend, you \nare absolutely right. And I know that chapter as you do and have \nstudied it. But under the law, the Secretary of Defense is still the \nhead of the Department, and as such I suppose he can alter the field \nmanual of the Army and make it less in the present form and in the \nrevised form in due course. But I think it is important we have a clear \nchain of authority and accountability. I look up the chain, and there \nare the laws established by the Secretary of Defense as opposed to \nthose who might be involved in drawing up the Army Field Manual. I \npresume the Secretary of the Army is at the top of that pyramid.\n  But that is the reason I put in this amendment. I say to my good \nfriend from Arizona, I hope we can sort this out before final passage \nand possibly amend it. I will withdraw mine because I want you to take \nthe lead in every respect on this important amendment.\n  If I might add, I say to my friend from Arizona, there is another \nimportant amendment you needed to get completed.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thought my colleague wanted me to wait \non the additional amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, whatever.\n  Mr. McCAIN. But I will be glad to proceed. Why don't we let the \nSenator from South Carolina talk, and then maybe, if it is all right, I \nwill offer the other amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request. I ask \nunanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor to amendment No. 1557, \nwhich is the field manual amendment to which they have been referring.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if I could be recognized just for 1 minute \nto comment on this amendment, and then I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first of all, I congratulate Senator \nMcCain. I do not think there is anybody in this body who speaks with \ngreater authority on the subject matter he has spoken to in this \namendment. I commend him for the distinction he is making. It is a \ncritical distinction. In addition to the fact that the field manual is \nthere for everybody to see and has historic meaning, the difference \nbetween the McCain amendment and the one which was offered by the \nSenator from Virginia--another difference--is that the field manual is \na public document. You can read what is in the field manual. The \nSecretary of Defense memoranda too often have been classified \n``unavailable.'' We have been spending sometimes months and years \ntrying to just find out what is in those memoranda.\n  So there is a very important difference between these two amendments \nin a number of regards. I very much believe that the first amendment, \namendment No. 1557, is the way which is most consistent with our \nvalues. It makes it very clear, in public, what the authorities are and \nwhat the standards and criteria are. The contrast between that and \nsomething amorphous, which gives the Secretary of Defense a power he \nalready has anyway, which is to issue regulations but to do so in \nsecret and in a classified way, leads to more vagueness, more \nuncertainty, more conflict, more inability of Congress to perform \noversight.\n  So I commend the Senator from Arizona for this amendment. I believe \nthe differences between these two amendments are significant.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I accept my good friend's critique, but I \ndo point out, as the Army Field Manual is under revision, there will be \nboth a classified and unclassified portion of that manual.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if I could just comment briefly on that, at \nleast with the unclassified portion, we have access to it, unlike the \ndocuments that are issued by the Secretary of Defense memoranda. They \nare classified, but they are also, too often, unavailable to Congress. \nThey just use one excuse after another not to make those memoranda \navailable to Congress. So there may be a classified version of the \nfield manual, but at least Congress has access to that unclassified \nversion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am well aware of the efforts of my good \nfriend from Michigan to get documents from the Department of Defense \nand his modest success and some lack of success.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from \nSouth Carolina such time as he deems necessary.\n  Could the Chair advise us as to the amount of time remaining under \nthe hour that I requested?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has 20 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is the full time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has 13 minutes. The \nSenator from Arizona has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, we will allocate the time among the three of us in \nan equitable way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1557, As Modified\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator McCain's \namendment. The point that Senator Warner is making, I fully understand. \nBut I think we are at a crossroads in the war on terror. Guantanamo Bay \nhas great potential to make us safer as a nation. But one of the \nproblems we have experienced in this war is a problem of image. It is a \nnew kind of enemy with a lot of nuances. But one thing we cannot do as \na nation is forget who we are, what got us here for 200-something \nyears. We can fight this enemy aggressively, no-holds-barred, go after \nthem, and not lose who we are.\n  Senator McCain is addressing one of the problems we have found crop \nup in different areas of the world when it comes to noncitizen foreign \nterrorists, and that is how you interrogate and stay within the \nboundaries of who you are as a people and not getting your own people \nin trouble by cutting corners.\n  So the reason I am supporting his amendment--and we are not just \nsaying: Secretary of Defense, come up with a solution here--is because, \nafter a lot of thought and study, it is clear to me that the Army Field \nManual gives you everything you need to aggressively interrogate and \nseek good intelligence from foreign noncitizen terrorists held at GTMO \nand any other place under DOD control.\n\n[[Page S8794]]\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to submit for the Record several memos \nthat have just been recently declassified. They were requested on \nOctober 7 of last year by myself, Senator Levin, and Senator McCain. \nThe first one is a 27 February 2003 memo from BG Kevin M. Sandkuhler, \nU.S. Marine Corps, Staff Judge Advocate to CMC. The next one is from MG \nThomas J. Romig, U.S. Army, the Judge Advocate General, dated 3 March \n2003. The next is from MG Jack L.

The next is Rear Admiral Lohr, dated 13 March 2002. And the final \nmemo is from Major General Rives, Deputy Judge Advocate General, U.S. \nAir Force, dated 5 February 2003. I ask unanimous consent those \nmemorandums be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Department of the Navy,\n\n\n                               Headquarters U.S. Marine Corps,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 27, 2003.\n     Memorandum for General Counsel of the Air Force\n     Subject: Working Group Recommendations on Detainee \n         Interrogations\n\n       1. In addition to comments we submitted 5 February, we \n     concur with the recommendations submitted by the Navy (TJAG \n     RADM Lohr), the Air Force (TJAG MGen Rives), and the Joint \n     Staff Legal Counsel's Office. Their recommendations dealt \n     with policy considerations, contention with the OLC opinion, \n     and foreign interpretations of GC IV (Civilians) and \n     customary international law, respectively.\n       2. The common thread among our recommendations is concern \n     for servicemembers. OLC does not represent the services; \n     thus, understandably, concern for servicemembers is not \n     reflected in their opinion. Notably, their opinion is silent \n     on the UCMJ and foreign views of international law.\n       3. We nonetheless recommend that the Working Group product \n     accurately portray the services' concerns that the \n     authorization of aggressive counter-resistance techniques by \n     servicemembers will adversely impact the following:\n       a. Treatment of U.S. Servicemembers by Captors and \n     compliance with International Law.\n       b. Criminal and Civil Liability of DOD Military and \n     Civilian Personnel in Domestic, Foreign, and International \n     Forums.\n       c. U.S. and International Public Support and Respect of \n     U.S. Armed Forces.\n       d. Pride, Discipline, and Self-Respect within the U.S. \n     Armed Forces.\n       e.

Change p. 54, fifth paragraph, to read as follows (new \n     language italic):\n       ([S/NF]U) Choice of interrogation techniques involves a \n     risk benefit analysis in each case, bounded by the limits of \n     DOD policy and law. When assessing whether to use exceptional \n     interrogation techniques, consideration should be given to \n     the possible adverse effects on U.S. Armed Forces culture and \n     self-image which suffered during the Vietnam conflict and at \n     other times due to perceived law of war violations. DOD \n     policy indoctrinated in the DOD Law of War Program in 1979 \n     and subsequent service regulations, greatly restored the \n     culture and self-image of U.S. Armed Forces by establishing \n     high benchmarks of compliance with the principles and spirit \n     of the law of war and humane treatment of all persons in U.S. \n     Armed Forces custody. In addition, consideration should be \n     given to whether implementation of such techniques is likely \n     to result in adverse impacts for DOD personnel who are \n     captured or detained [become POWs,] including possible \n     perceptions by other nations that the United States is \n     lowering standards related to the treatment of prisoners and \n     other detainees, generally.\n       2. Add to p. 68, a paragraph after the seventh paragraph \n     that reads:\n       (U) Comprehensive protection is lacking for DOD personnel \n     who may be tried by other nations and/or international bodies \n     for violations of international law, such as violations of \n     the Geneva or Hague Conventions, the Additional Protocols, \n     the Torture Convention, the Rome Statute of the ICC, or the \n     Customary International Law of Human Rights. This risk has \n     the potential to impact future operations and overseas travel \n     of such personnel, both on and off duty.\n                                  ____\n\n         Department of the Army, Office of the Judge Advocate \n           General,\n                                    Washington, DC, March 3, 2003.\n\n\n   MEMORANDUM FOR GENERAL COUNSEL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE\n\n     Subject: Draft Report and Recommendations of the Working \n         Group to Access the Legal, Policy and Operational Issues \n         Related to Interrogation of Detainees Held by the U.S. \n         Armed Forces in the War on Terrorism (U)\n\n       1. (U) The purpose of this memorandum is to advise the \n     Department of Defense (DOD) General Counsel of a number of \n     serious concerns regarding the draft Report and \n     Recommendations of the Working Group to Access the Legal, \n     Policy and Operational Issues Related to Interrogation of \n     Detainees Held by the U.S. Armed Forces in the War on \n     Terrorism (Final Report). These concerns center around the \n     potential Department of Defense (DOD) sanctioning of detainee \n     interrogation techniques that may appear to violate \n     international law, domestic law, or both.\n       2. (U) The Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), Department of \n     Justice (DOJ), provided DOD with its analysis of \n     international and domestic law as it relates to the \n     interrogation of detainees held by the United States \n     Government. This analysis was incorporated into the subject \n     draft Report and forms, almost exclusively, the legal \n     framework for the Report's Conclusions, Recommendations, and \n     PowerPoint spreadsheet analysis of the interrogation \n     techniques in issue. I am concerned with several pivotal \n     aspects of the OLC opinion.\n       3. (U) While the OLC analysis speaks to a number of \n     defenses that could be raised on behalf of those who engage \n     in interrogation techniques later perceived to be illegal, \n     the ``bottom line'' defense proffered by OLC is an \n     exceptionally broad concept of ``necessity.'' This defense is \n     based upon the premise that any existing federal statutory \n     provision or international obligation is unconstitutional per \n     se, where it otherwise prohibits conduct viewed by the \n     President, acting in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief, as \n     essential to his capacity to wage war. I question whether \n     this theory would ultimately prevail in either the U.S. \n     courts or in any international forum. If such a defense is \n     not available, soldiers ordered to use otherwise illegal \n     techniques run a substantial risk of criminal prosecution or \n     personal liability arising from a civil lawsuit.\n       4. (U) The OLC opinion states further that customary \n     international law cannot bind the U.S. Executive Branch as it \n     is not part of the federal law. As such, any presidential \n     decision made in the context of the ongoing war on terrorism \n     constitutes a ``controlling'' Executive act; one that \n     immediately and automatically displaces any contrary \n     provision of customary international law. This view runs \n     contrary to the historic position taken by the United States \n     Government concerning such laws and, in our opinion, could \n     adversely impact DOD interests worldwide. On the one hand, \n     such a policy will open us to international criticism that \n     the ``U.S. is a law unto itself.'' On the other, \n     implementation of questionable techniques will very likely \n     establish a new baseline for acceptable practice in this \n     area, putting our service personnel at far greater risk and \n     vitiating many of the POW/detainee safeguards the U.S. has \n     worked hard to establish over the past five decades.\n       5. (U) I recommend that the aggressive counter-resistance \n     interrogation techniques under consideration be vetted with \n     the Army intelligence community before a final decision on \n     their use is made. Some of these techniques do not comport \n     with Army doctrine as set forth in Field Manual (FM) 34-52 \n     Intelligence Interrogation, and may be of questionable \n     practical value in obtaining reliable information from those \n     being interrogated.\n\n                                              Thomas J. Romig,\n\n                                         Major General, U.S. Army,\n     The Judge Advocate General.\n                                  ____\n\n         Department of the Air Force, Office of the Judge Advocate \n           General,\n                                 Washington, DC, February 6, 2003.\n\n\n                         MEMORANDUM FOR SAF/GC\n\n     From: AF/JA\n     Subject: Comments on Draft Report and Recommendations of the \n         Working Group to Assess the Legal, Policy and Operational \n         Issues Relating to Interrogation of Detainees Held by the \n         U.S. Armed Forces in the War on Terrorism (U)\n\n       1. (U) Please note that while I accept that the Department \n     of Justice, Office of Legal Counsel (DoJ/OLC), speaks for the \n     Executive Branch and that its legal opinions in this matter \n     are to be followed, I continue to maintain that DoJ/OLC's \n     opinions on several of the Working Group's issues are \n     contentious. Others may disagree with various portions of the \n     DoJ/OLC analysis. I believe we should recognize this fact and \n     therefore urge that certain factors should be prominently \n     provided to the DoD/GC before he makes a final recommendation \n     to the Secretary of Defense. I recommend the following \n     specific modifications to the draft report dated 4 February \n     2003:\n       a. Page 2, add the following sentence to the end of \n     paragraph 2:\n       It should be noted that several of the legal opinions \n     expressed herein are likely to be viewed as contentious \n     outside the Executive Branch, both domestically and \n     internationally.\n       b. Page 54, change fourth full paragraph to read as \n     follows:\n       (U) Choice of interrogation techniques involves a risk \n     benefit analysis in each case, bounded by the limits of DOD \n     policy and law. When assessing whether to use exceptional \n     interrogation techniques, consideration should be given to \n     the possible adverse effects on U.S. Armed Forces culture and \n     self-\n\n[[Page S8795]]\n\n     image, which suffered during the Vietnam conflict and at \n     other times due to perceived law of armed conflict \n     violations. DoD policy, indoctrined in the DoD Law of War \n     Program in 1979 and subsequent service regulations, greatly \n     restored the culture and self-image of U.S. Armed Forces by \n     establishing high benchmarks of compliance with the \n     principles and spirit of the law of war, and humane treatment \n     of all persons in U.S. Armed Forces custody. U.S. Armed \n     Forces are continuously trained to take the legal and moral \n     ``high-road'' in the conduct of our military operations \n     regardless of how others may operate. While the detainees' \n     status as unlawful belligerents may not entitle them to \n     protections of the Geneva Conventions, that is a legal \n     distinction that may be lost on the members of the armed \n     forces. Approving exceptional interrogation techniques may be \n     seen as giving official approval and legal sanction to the \n     application of interrogation techniques that U.S. Armed \n     Forces have heretofore been trained are unlawful. In \n     addition, consideration should be given to whether \n     implementation of such techniques is likely to result in \n     adverse impacts for DoD personnel who become POWs, \n     including possible perceptions by other nations that the \n     United States is lowering standards related to the \n     treatment of prisoners, generally.\n       Alternatively, change the last paragraph on page 68, to \n     read as follows:\n       (U) The cultural and self-image of the U.S. Armed Forces \n     suffered during the Vietnam conflict and at other times due \n     to perceived law of armed conflict violations. DoD policy, \n     indoctrinated in the DoD Law of War Program in 1979 and \n     subsequent service regulations, greatly restored the culture \n     and self-image of U.S. Armed Forces. U.S. Armed Forces are \n     continuously trained to take the legal and moral ``high-\n     road'' in the conduct of our military operations regardless \n     of how others may operate. While the detainees' status as \n     unlawful belligerents may not entitle them to protections of \n     the Geneva Conventions, that is a legal distinction that may \n     be lost on the members of the armed forces. Approving \n     exceptional interrogation techniques may be seen as giving \n     official approval and legal sanction to the application of \n     interrogation techniques that U.S. Armed Forces have \n     heretofore been trained are unlawful. General use of \n     exceptional techniques (generally, having substantially \n     greater risk than those currently, routinely used by U.S. \n     Armed Forces interrogators), even though lawful, may create \n     uncertainty among interrogators regarding the appropriate \n     limits of interrogations, and may adversely affect the \n     cultural self-image of the U.S. armed forces.\n       c. Page 68, add the following new paragraphs after the \n     sixth full paragraph:\n       (U) Several of the exceptional techniques, on their face, \n     amount to violations of domestic criminal law and the UCMJ \n     (e.g., assault). Applying exceptional techniques places \n     interrogators and the chain of command at risk of criminal \n     accusations domestically. Although one or more of the \n     aforementioned defenses to these accusations may apply, it is \n     impossible to be certain that any of these defenses will be \n     successful as the judiciary may interpret the applicable law \n     differently from the interpretation provided herein.\n       (U) Other nations are likely to view the exceptional \n     interrogation techniques as violative of international law \n     and perhaps violative of their own domestic law. This places \n     interrogators and the chain of command at risk of criminal \n     accusations abroad, either in foreign domestic courts or in \n     international fora, to include the ICC.\n       d. Page 68, add the following new paragraphs after the \n     eighth full paragraph:\n       (U) Employment of exceptional interrogation techniques may \n     have a negative effect on the treatment of U.S. POWs. Other \n     nations may disagree with the President's status \n     determination regarding Operation ENDURING FREEDOM (OEF) \n     detainees, concluding that the detainees are POWs entitled to \n     all of the protections of the Geneva Conventions. Treating \n     OEF detainees inconsistently with the Conventions arguably \n     ``lowers the bar'' for the treatment of U.S. POWs in future \n     conflicts. Even where nations agree with the President's \n     status determination, many may view the exceptional \n     techniques as violative of other law.\n       2. (U) Should any information concerning the exceptional \n     techniques become public, it is likely to be exaggerated/\n     distorted in both the U.S. and international media. This \n     could have a negative impact on international, and perhaps \n     even domestic, support for the war on terrorism. It could \n     likewise have a negative impact on public perception of the \n     U.S. military in general.\n\n                                                Jack L. Rives,\n\n                                              Major General, USAF,\n     Deputy Judge Advocate General.\n                                  ____\n\n         Department of the Navy, Office of the Judge Advocate \n           General,\n                                 Washington, DC, February 6, 2003.\n     Subj: Working Group recommendations relating to interrogation \n         of detainees.\n\n       1. Earlier today I provided to you a number of suggested \n     changes, additions, and deletions to the subject document.\n       2. I would like to further recommend that the document make \n     very clear to decision-makers that its legal conclusions are \n     limited to arguably unique circumstances of this group of \n     detainees, i.e., unlawful combatants held ``outside'' the \n     United States. Because of these unique circumstances, the \n     U.S. Torture Statute, the Constitution, the Geneva \n     Conventions and customary international law do not apply, \n     thereby affording policy latitude that likely does not exist \n     in almost any other circumstance. (The UCMJ, however, does \n     apply to U.S. personnel conducting the interrogations.)\n       3. Given this unique set of circumstances, I believe policy \n     considerations continue to loom very large. Should service \n     personnel be conducting the interrogations? How will this \n     affect their treatment when incarcerated abroad and our \n     ability to call others to account for their treatment? More \n     broadly, while we may have found a unique situation in GTMO \n     where the protections of the Geneva Conventions, U.S. \n     statutes, and even the Constitution do not apply, will the \n     American people find we have missed the forest for the trees \n     by condoning practices that, while technically legal, are \n     inconsistent with our most fundamental values? How would such \n     perceptions affect our ability to prosecute the Global War on \n     Terrorism?\n       4. I accept the premise that this group of detainees is \n     different, and that lawyers should identify legal \n     distinctions where they exist. It must be conceded, however, \n     that we are preparing to treat these detainees very \n     differently than we treat any other group, and differently \n     than we permit our own people to be treated either at home or \n     abroad. At a minimum, I recommend that decision-makers be \n     made fully aware of the very narrow set of circumstances--\n     factually and legally--upon which the policy rests. Moreover, \n     I recommend that we consider asking decision-makers directly: \n     is this the ``right thing'' for U.S. military personnel?\n\n                                              Michael F.

Finally, add new footnote to reference \n     the OLC opinion to read ``Memorandum dated March xx, 2003., \n     Re: xxxxxxxxxx.\n       Rationale: this WG paper contains large segments of DOJ \n     work product, rather than being ``informed'' by DOJ. We \n     believe the OLC opinion should be incorporated by reference \n     into the WG report.\n       2. (U) Page 24, second paragraph, last sentence: delete.\n       Rationale: this sentence is not true. There are domestic \n     limits on the President's power to interrogate prisoners. One \n     of them is Congress's advice and consent to the US \n     ratification to the Geneva Conventions that limit the \n     interrogation of POWs. The willingness of the Executive, and \n     of the Legislative Branch, to enforce those restrictions is a \n     different matter.\n       3. (U) Page 24, footnote 20: delete or rewrite to read, \n     ``This is the stated view of the Department of Justice.''\n       Rationale: Mr. Yoo clearly stated that he believes the \n     viability of these defenses is greatly enhanced by advance \n     Presidential direction in the matter. He specifically \n     recommended obtaining such direction in writing.\n       4. (U) Page 26, first full paragraph, first sentence: \n     delete.\n       Rationale: this statement is too broad. The similar \n     language used at the end of the following paragraph is more \n     accurate.\n       5. (U) Page 29, second paragraph, fifth sentence: Rewrite \n     sentence to read, ``A leading scholarly commentator . . .'' \n     and later in the sentence change ``. . . section 2340 would \n     be justified under . . .'' to ``. . . section 2340 should be \n     justified under . . .''\n       Rationale: There is only one article written by one person \n     cited. Also the quoted language from the commentator \n     indicates his view that torture should be permissible, not a \n     statement that international law allows such.\n       6. (U) Page 29, second paragraph, last sentence: delete.\n       Rationale: this conclusion is far too broad but the general \n     principle can be inferred from the discussion.\n       7. (U) Page 31, para d, third sentence and penultimate \n     sentences: delete.\n       Rationale: This analogy is inapt. There is nothing in law \n     enforcement that would authorize the use of torture or \n     excessive force against persons for intelligence gathering.\n       8. (U) Page 41, second paragraph, penultimate sentence: \n     delete.\n       Rationale: it is not clear what the meaning of the sentence \n     is.\n       9. (U) Page 59, second paragraph: it is unclear if SECDEF \n     must approve exceptional techniques on a case-by-case basis, \n     or just approve their use generally.\n       10. (U) Page 63, footnote 86. The text of this footnote \n     does not correspond to its citation\n\n[[Page S8796]]\n\n     in the paper. It appears that the current text of footnote 86 \n     belongs as part of the discussion of API in the paragraph \n     above, or as part of the text of footnotes 83 or 84. Footnote \n     86 should detail the rationale for the Justice Department \n     determination that GCIV does not apply.\n       11. (U) Page 67, technique 26: Add last sentence to read, \n     ``Members of the armed forces will not threaten the detainee \n     with the possible results of the transfer, but will instead \n     limit the threat to the fact of transfer to allow the \n     detainee to form their own conclusions about such a move.''\n       Rationale: threatening the detainee with death or injury \n     (by the transfer) may be considered torture under \n     international law.\n       12. (U) Page 72, second paragraph: in the last sentence \n     replace ``protections of the Geneva Conventions'' with \n     ``protections of the third Geneva Convention.''\n       Rationale: clarity\n       13. (U) Page 72, second paragraph: add new last sentence to \n     read: ``Under international law, the protections of the \n     fourth Geneva Convention may apply to the detainees.''\n       Rationale: this view is shared by Chairman's Legal and all \n     the services.\n       14. (U) Page 72, third paragraph: at the beginning add, \n     ``In those cases where the President has made a controlling \n     executive decision or action . . .''\n       Rationale: this is the standard by which the President may \n     ``override'' CIL.\n       15. (U) Page 73, sixth paragraph: Add new last sentence to \n     read, ``Presidential written directive to engage in these \n     techniques will enhance the successful assertion of the \n     potential defenses discussed in this paper.''\n       Rationaie: much of the analysis in this paper is premised \n     on the authority of the President as delegated/directed, in \n     writing, to SECDEF and beyond. This point needs to be made \n     prominently.\n       16. (U) Matrix Annex, Technique 33: delete.\n       Rationale: It is not clear what the intent of this \n     technique is. If it loses its effectiveness after the first \n     or second use, it appears to be little more than a gratuitous \n     assault. Other methods are equally useful in getting/\n     maintaining the attention of the detainee. It also has the \n     potential to be applied differently by different individuals.\n       17. (U) Page 75, first paragraph, in the discussion re \n     technique 36: Rewrite 3rd to last and penultimate sentences \n     to read, ``The working group believes use of technique 36 \n     would constitute torture under international and U.S. law \n     and, accordingly, should not be utilized. In the event SECDEF \n     decides to authorize this technique, the working group \n     believes armed forces personnel should not participate as \n     interrogators as they are subject to UCMJ jurisdiction at all \n     times.''\n       This is a correct statement of the positions of the \n     services party to the working group, who all believe this \n     technique constitutes torture under both domestic and \n     international law.\n       18. Thank you for the opportunity to comment. My action \n     officer in this matter is CDR Steve Gallotta.\n\n                                              Michael F. Lohr,\n\n                                    Rear Admiral, JAGC, U.S. Navy,\n     Judge Advocate General.\n                                  ____\n\n         Department of the Air Force, Office of the Judge Advocate \n           General,\n                                 Washington, DC, February 5, 2003.\n\n\n                         memorandum for saf/gc\n\n     From: AF/JA\n     Subject: Final Report and Recommendations of the Working \n         Group to Assess the Legal, Policy and Operational Issues \n         Relating to Interrogation of Detainees Held by the U.S. \n         Armed Forces in the War on Terrorism (U)\n\n       1. (U) In drafting the subject report and recommendations, \n     the legal opinions of the Department of Justice, Office of \n     Legal Counsel (DoJ/OLC), were relied on almost exclusively. \n     Although the opinions of DoJ/OLC are to be given a great deal \n     of weight within the Executive Branch, their positions on \n     several of the Working Group's issues are contentious. As our \n     discussion demonstrate, others within and outside the \n     Executive Branch are likely to disagree. The report and \n     recommendations caveat that it only applies to ``strategic \n     interrogations'' of ``unlawful combatants'' at locations \n     outside the United States. Although worded to permit maximum \n     flexibility and legal interpretation, I believe other factors \n     need to be provided to the DoD/GC before he makes a final \n     recommendation to the Secretary of Defense.\n       2. (U) Several of the more extreme interrogation \n     techniques, on their face, amount to violations of domestic \n     criminal law and the UCMJ (e.g., assault). Applying the more \n     extreme techniques during the interrogation of detainees \n     places the interrogators and the chain of command at risk of \n     criminal accusations domestically. Although a wide range of \n     defenses to these accusations theoretically apply, it is \n     impossible to be certain that any defense will be successful \n     at trial; our domestic courts may well disagree with DoJ/\n     OLC's interpretation of the law. Further, while the current \n     administration is not likely to pursue prosecution, it is \n     impossible to predict how future administrations will view \n     the use of such techniques.\n       3. (U) Additionally, other nations are unlikely to agree \n     with DoJ/OLC's interpretation of the law in some instances. \n     Other nations may disagree with the President's status \n     determination regarding the Operation ENDURING FREEDOM (OEF) \n     detainees; they may conclude that the detainees are POWs \n     entitled to all of the protections of the Geneva Conventions. \n     Treating OEF detainees inconsistently with the Conventions \n     arguably ``lowers the bar'' for the treatment of U.S. POWs in \n     future conflicts. Even where nations agree with the \n     President's status determination, many would view the more \n     extreme interrogation techniques as violative of other \n     international law (other treaties or customary international \n     law) and perhaps violative of their own domestic law. This \n     puts the interrogators and the chain of command at risk of \n     criminal accusations abroad, either in foreign domestic \n     courts or in international fora, to include the ICC.\n       4. (U) Should any information regarding the use of the more \n     extreme interrogation techniques become public, it is likely \n     to be exaggerated/distorted in both the U.S. and \n     international media. This could have a negative impact on \n     international, and perhaps even domestic, support for the war \n     on terrorism. Moreover, it could have a negative impact on \n     public perception of the U.S. military in general.\n       5. (U) Finally, the use of the more extreme interrogation \n     techniques simply is not how the U.S. armed forces have \n     operated in recent history. We have taken the legal and moral \n     ``high-road'' in the conduct of our military operations \n     regardless of how others may operate. Our forces are trained \n     in this legal and moral mindset beginning the day they enter \n     active duty. It should be noted that law of armed conflict \n     and code of conduct training have been mandated by Congress \n     and emphasized since the Viet Nam conflict when our POWs were \n     subjected to torture by their captors. We need to consider \n     the overall impact of approving extreme interrogation \n     techniques as giving official approval and legal sanction to \n     the application of interrogation techniques that U.S. forces \n     have consistently been trained are unlawful.\n\n                                                Jack L. Rives,\n\n                                              Major General, USAF,\n                                    Deputy Judge Advocate General.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Now, over time, we are going to learn more about what \nthese memos tell us, but basically these memos are telling us that the \nproposed interrogation techniques dealing with the war on terror, \nsuggested by the Department of Justice, sent over to Department of \nDefense, were such a deviation from the normal way of doing business \nthat it would get our own people in trouble. It was such a deviation \nfrom the normal way of doing business that we would lose the moral high \nground in fighting the war on terror.\n  General Rives sums up:\n\n       Finally, the use of the more extreme interrogation \n     techniques simply is not how the U.S. armed forces have \n     operated in recent history. We have taken the legal and moral \n     ``high-road'' in the conduct of our military operations \n     regardless of how others may operate. Our forces are trained \n     in this legal and moral mindset beginning the day they enter \n     active duty. It should be noted that [the] law of armed \n     conflict and code of conduct training have been mandated by \n     Congress and emphasized since the Viet Nam conflict when our \n     POWs were subjected to torture by their captors. We need to \n     consider the overall impact of approving extreme \n     interrogation techniques as giving official approval and \n     legal sanction to the application of interrogation techniques \n     that U.S. forces have consistently been trained are unlawful.\n\n  He talks about a slippery slope that we are about to embark on that \nwill result in some of our own people being subject to being court-\nmartialed because the Uniform Code of Military Justice has many \nprovisions dictating how you will treat someone who is in your custody \nas a detainee. And they were trying to tell the Department of Justice \nand the Department of Defense civilian lawyers: Do not go down this \nroad. You are going to bite off more problems than it is worth.\n  Admiral Lohr says that some of the techniques would violate the \ntorture statute. I will read in more detail later what these memos are \ntelling us the rules of the road are. But these are not from the ACLU. \nThese are not from people who are soft on terrorism, who want to coddle \nforeign terrorists. These are all professional military lawyers who \nhave dedicated their lives, with 20-plus year careers, to serving the \nmen and women in uniform and protecting their Nation. They were giving \na warning shot across the bow of the policymakers that there are \ncertain corners you cannot afford to cut because you will wind up \nmeeting yourself.\n  What Senator McCain is trying to do is build upon their advice by \nputting in\n\n[[Page S8797]]\n\nplace an interrogation technique that this country can be proud of, \nthat we all will understand, and that can be implemented to make us \nsafer without having a black eye throughout the world.\n  I asked the question--when I went to GTMO with the chairman about a \nweek or 2 ago--to all the interrogators there: Is there anything \nlacking in the Army Field Manual that would inhibit your ability to get \ngood intelligence? And they said no. I asked: Could you live with the \nArmy Field Manual as your guide and do your job? They said yes.\n  The reason the Army Field Manual is a good source is because it has \nbeen part of who we are for years. People are trained on it. What was \nhappening is, the Department of Justice, understandably, after \nSeptember 11, wanted to come up with the most aggressive techniques \npossible to deal with foreign terrorists. But the JAGS are telling us \nyou cannot look at this one event in isolation. You have to understand \nwhat we have been standing for for 60 years and what the law actually \nsays. The DOJ's interpretation of the torture statute from a lawyer's \npoint of view was absurd. And the JAGS were telling the policymakers: \nIf you go down this road, you are going to get your own people in \ntrouble. You are on a slippery slope. You are going to lose the moral \nhigh ground. This was 2003. And they were absolutely right.\n  To Secretary Rumsfeld's credit, when he heard about the working group \nhaving problems with the DOJ's suggested interpretations of \n``interrogation,'' he reconvened and the techniques changed. But as \nSenator McCain has said very well, we need to bring certainty to this \nprocess of interrogating foreign terrorists to make sure we can get \ngood, reliable information. We can do it in a way that people \nunderstand, our troops will not get in trouble, and we can show the \nworld we are truly a rule-of-law nation.\n  There is nothing inconsistent with interrogating people to get good \ninformation to protect our country and using the Army Field Manual. \nWhat has got us in trouble is when we try to make it up as we go, when \nwe forget who we are, when we will not listen to people who have worn \nthe uniform, who are in uniform, telling us: Do not go down this road, \nour people are trained to do it one way, you are confusing the heck out \nof them.\n  What have we learned in the last 2 years? If you know what the rules \nare about interrogating anybody, come tell me because I can't figure it \nout. I have spent 20 years as an Air Force lawyer myself. There is much \nconfusion, and confusion in war is dangerous. Anyone who misunderstands \nwhat we are doing here in terms of our view of terrorists is playing \npolitics. No one supporting this amendment wants a foreign noncitizen \nterrorist not to be aggressively detained, prosecuted, if appropriate, \nand interrogated to make our country safer. We can prosecute, we can \ndetain, and we can interrogate aggressively, but we have to have rules \nthat our people can understand and don't deviate from who we are as a \nNation. That is why I am supporting this amendment.\n  Everyone who works at GTMO dealing with the 500 foreign noncitizen \nterrorist suspects, enemy combatants, has told me, because I asked the \nquestion, if you use the Army Field Manual, we have everything within \nthat manual we need to do the job right. If you use the Army Field \nManual, we will be back in a good place with the law. We will be back \nin a place where our people can understand what is going on. We will \nagain capture the moral high ground which is the ultimate way to win \nthis war.\n  There is no downside to this. The upside is huge. We are able to get \ngood information, not get our people in trouble, and have a better \nimage in the world. That is why I am supporting this amendment.\n  I have included these memos for the record. It would serve every \nSenator well to spend 5 or 10 minutes reading through them because \nthese people were telling us in 2003, if you go down this road, the \nroad we chose initially, you are going to get everybody involved in \ntrouble. That is exactly what happened.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1556, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have amendment No. 1556 at the desk. I \nask unanimous consent for its modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, is it the desire that I call up 1556 at \nthis time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, Mr. President, I suggest that we have amended the \npresent one which is referred to as the Army Field Manual, and I am a \ncosponsor on that. Now there is a second amendment. I submitted to the \nSenator a suggestion, I believe that is----\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is modified.\n  Mr. WARNER. Let's bring that up now and have that pending.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nNo. 1556 be considered at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Reserving the right to object, I know the discussion \nhas been going on about the field manual issue. Is the Senator now \ngoing to that amendment or are we leaving that amendment? I would like \nto at least make a few remarks about that subject.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the field manual amendment has been laid \naside for the moment. This goes to a second amendment which is----\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Was there a unanimous consent request made for that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair heard a unanimous consent request to \nmove to a new amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. And the Chair asked if there was objection. \nDid the Senator from Alabama object?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I object at this point because I don't understand what \nwe are doing. I want to be able to speak on the amendment dealing with \nthe field manual.\n  Mr. WARNER. I believe the Senator has just come on the floor. We have \nbeen on this now for about 45 minutes covering the parameter of the \nissues that would be brought up. I respect his desire to speak. We will \ntry to accommodate you at any point. I would urge that we allow the \nSenator from Arizona to perfect this amendment and then in due course \nhe will speak to it. I will speak to it, and we will lay it aside. And \nwe will find the time for the distinguished Senator from Alabama to \nspeak.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, everybody has spoken for it. Nobody has spoken \nagainst it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I ask, maybe we could take a maximum of 5 minutes, \n3 or 4 minutes on this amendment, for which I had unanimous consent, \nand then go back to allow the Senator from Alabama to speak.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That would be fine. If I could have 10 minutes, if I \ncould share a few thoughts on the previous amendment in the next 10 \nminutes, I would be happy.\n  Mr. WARNER. We definitely will make that happen. But I want to \ninquire of the Senator from South Carolina, you also have a third \namendment. I am not sure of the status. You have it at the desk. You \nhave spoken to it.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would like at this time to submit it to the desk if I \nmay.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to propose this \namendment, the Senator from Alabama be allowed to speak for 10 minutes, \nthe amendment be set aside, and the Senator from South Carolina be \nallowed to propose his amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think that is a very orderly manner in \nwhich to accommodate. Then the Senator from Alabama--let's get the time \nremaining and I will yield some of my time to the Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion on the floor right now is to call \nup, as I understand it, amendment No. 1556 by the Senator from Arizona \nas modified.\n  Mr. McCAIN. As modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Reserving the right to object, I don't intend to \nobject, I understand we are working out some amendments. I also have an \namendment I would like to offer. I wanted to raise, as the agreement is \nbeing put together, that I have the opportunity to do that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will assure you, working with the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan, we\n\n[[Page S8798]]\n\nwill arrange--he has time immediately following the 1 hour being \ndivided between three Senators and now a fourth. I want to make sure we \nhave the time remaining to satisfy the needs of the Senator from \nAlabama. We now are proceeding on the second McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to reporting amendment No. \n1556 by the Senator from Arizona?\n  Mr. McCAIN. As modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. As modified. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1556, as modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle G of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1073. PROHIBITION ON CRUEL, INHUMAN, OR DEGRADING \n                   TREATMENT OR PUNISHMENT OF PERSONS UNDER \n                   CUSTODY OR CONTROL OF THE UNITED STATES \n                   GOVERNMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--No individual in the custody or under the \n     physical control of the United States Government, regardless \n     of nationality or physical location, shall be subject to \n     cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.\n       (b) Presidential Waiver.--(1) The President may waive the \n     prohibition in subsection (a), on a case-by-case basis, if \n     the President--\n       (A) determines that the waiver is required for a military \n     or national security necessity; and\n       (B) submits the appropriate committees of Congress timely \n     notice of the exercise of the waiver.\n       (2) The authority of the President under paragraph (1) may \n     not be delegated.\n       (c) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall not be \n     construed to impose any geographical limitation on the \n     applicability of the prohibition against cruel, inhuman, or \n     degrading treatment or punishment under this section.\n       (d) Limitation on Supersedure.--The provisions of this \n     section shall not be superseded, except by a provision of law \n     enacted after the date of the enactment of this Act which \n     specifically repeals, modifies, or supersedes the provisions \n     of this section.\n       (e) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) The term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' means--\n       (A) the Committees on Armed Services and Appropriations and \n     the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate; and\n       (B) the Committees on Armed Services and Appropriations and \n     the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House \n     of Representatives.\n       (2) The term ``cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or \n     punishment'' means the cruel, unusual, and inhumane treatment \n     or punishment prohibited by the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth \n     Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, as \n     defined in the United States Reservations, Declarations and \n     Understandings to the United Nations Convention Against \n     Torture and Other Forms of Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading \n     Treatment or Punishment done at New York, December 10, 1984.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we would like to have the Senator from \nArizona take such time as he desires to explain this. I wish to be \nadded as a cosponsor to this amendment. Then we will yield the floor to \nthe Senator from Alabama to speak for up to 10 minutes on the subjects \nof these three amendments. Then the balance of the time will be \naccorded to the Senator from South Carolina to bring forth his \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will notify the Senators that the \nChair is still working under the original previous order of an hour \nequally divided, 20 minutes to the Senator from South Carolina, 20 \nminutes to the Senator from Virginia, and 20 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct. Would the Chair advise of the three \nSenators in the original order, what is the time remaining for each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 2 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from Virginia has 9 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WARNER. I can't hear the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has 9 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from South Carolina has 2 minutes--10 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield from my 9 minutes such time as the Senator from \nArizona may need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, with all due respect to the chairman, I \ndon't think that is going to quite work because the Senator from \nAlabama needs 10 minutes. And if you are using your 9 and I only have \n2, that doesn't get it done. I ask unanimous consent that I have 3 \nminutes to discuss my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is an additional 3 minutes. I ask unanimous consent \nthat following that, the Senator from Alabama be recognized for 10 \nminutes in addition to the unanimous consent agreement, and then the \nSenator from South Carolina be allowed to propose his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this \namendment and the previous amendment, No. 1557.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request to ask for \nthe yeas and nays on two amendments at this time?\n  Without objection, it is in order to so request.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nWarner, Senator Lindsey Graham, and Senator Collins be added as \ncosponsors. I believe we are still scheduled for a vote at 5:30.\n  Mr. President, this amendment would prohibit cruel, inhuman, and \ndegrading treatment of persons in the detention of the U.S. Government. \nThe amendment doesn't sound like anything new. That is because it \nisn't. The prohibition has been a longstanding principle in both law \nand policy in the United States. The Universal Declaration of Human \nRights adopted in 1948 states simply that: No one shall be subject to \ntorture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment. The \nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which the U.S. \nis a signatory, is the same. The Binding Convention Against Torture, \nnegotiated by the Reagan administration, ratified by the Senate, \nprohibits cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment. On last year's DOD \nauthorization bill, the Senate passed a bipartisan amendment \nreaffirming that no detainee in U.S. custody can be subject to torture \nor cruel treatment as the U.S. has long defined these terms. All of \nthis seems to be common sense and in accordance with longstanding \nAmerican values.\n  I will be glad to explain that amendment more if anyone wants. In the \nmeantime, I know the Senator from Alabama is waiting.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time on this amendment. I ask \nunanimous consent we return at this time to amendment No. 1557, \naccording to the previous unanimous consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Alabama is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. If the Senator will withhold, I want to endorse the \nMcCain amendment. Essentially what he is doing is codifying what is \npolicy now. I think it is of such importance that it would require this \nbill to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1557\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will share a little bit of the history \nof what has happened, as I recall it. I am sorry, I just got back from \nAlabama and was not able to participate earlier in the debate. We have \nhad maybe 29 hearings involving prisoner abuse. That is a lot of \nhearings. I serve on the Judiciary and Armed Services Committees. \nProbably 20 of those have been in those 2 committees of which I have \nbeen a member and tried to participate as much as I could in each one \nof them. I remember that the U.S. military announced they had problems \nin Abu Ghraib with prisoner abuse. They indicated they were conducting \nan investigation of it. Members of the Senate, like dogs that chase a \ncar down the road, sometimes I thought they thought they were making \nthe car go because they were chasing it.\n  The military commenced, on its own accord, an investigation that has \nculminated in the conviction of a number of people who have gone to \njail for rather substantial periods of time for\n\n[[Page S8799]]\n\nviolating the policies of the Department of Defense and the laws of war \non those prisoners in Abu Ghraib. It took place on a midnight shift and \nwas not justified. It was beyond the law, and they have been punished \nfor it. That has been morphed into allegations about what happened at \nGuantanamo.\n  We apprehended 17,000 prisoners in Afghanistan and Iraq. We brought \n700 to Guantanamo. There are only 500 left. Some of those are the worst \nof the worst. Allegations were made that they were being abused. A \nthorough investigation has been conducted of that. Once again, we had a \ncommittee hearing to rehear the report. General Schmidt said there were \n24,000 investigations. He found three areas in which he felt things had \ngone awry at Guantanamo. All happened right quickly after 9/11, not \ngoing on now, because I was there at Guantanamo Friday a week ago and \nthey absolutely assured us, Senator Graham and others who were with us, \nChairman Warner, that nothing like that is going on today.\n  But what were the three complaints? Mr. Khatani, the 20th hijacker, \nhe found, had been abused cumulatively, three different things \nhappened. He was interrogated for 20 hours. He was made to listen to \nloud music. And at certain times he had been put in shackles. The \ngeneral found that was not torture under the definition of torture. It \nwas not inhuman. But together, they violated the standards the U.S. \nmilitary adheres to, and he felt that was in error.\n  One individual was screaming loudly repeatedly and would not stop. \nSomeone said he should be stopped. They found some duct tape, and \nAmericans, I guess, are good with that. They put it around his mouth. \nHe took it off, and they did it again. He took it off, and they did it \nagain. So they put it all the way around his head. He felt that was an \nabuse. A woman interviewer-interrogator, perhaps losing her temper, or \nwhatever, issued a threat to one of the prisoners and their family. \nThere were 3 out of 24,000 matters in Guantanamo.\n  So, first, I reject the idea that this Defense Department and our \nArmy and our military is out of control, is confused about what their \npowers and duties and responsibilities are. I reject that. I don't \nbelieve that is accurate.\n  Now, the field manual is good. We had a number of witnesses before \nthe committee. In one of the many hearings, General Taguba and several \nothers, when asked, or they just volunteered that the current rules of \ninterrogation under the field manual aren't appropriately applicable to \nall the kinds of new threats we face today and the kind of prisoners we \ndeal with today. These prisoners today are not under the Geneva \nConventions and aren't prisoners of war. They are unlawful combatants. \nThey sneak into countries. They don't wear a uniform. They don't carry \ntheir arms openly. They make bombs. They direct them not at military \ntargets but at men, women, and children who are going about their \npeaceful business. So it is indisputable that the Geneva Conventions \ndon't apply to them.\n  We have a statute in this country that prohibits torture of anybody \nin our control, and that statute stands firm and clear, and that is \ncertainly a basis for a criminal prosecution for anybody who goes too \nfar in interrogating witnesses.\n  Now, you are limited in what you can do when you interrogate a \nprisoner of war. We are told to give only name, rank, and serial \nnumber, and others have similar instructions from their countries. You \nare limited as to how much you can interrogate them and how much you \ncan expect them to say. These people are not prisoners of war. They are \nterrorists, unlawful combatants, determined to savage the peaceful \npeople of Spain and their railroad, the people of London, or the people \nof New York City. Thank God that because we have been aggressive and \nbeen after them and obtained intelligence from interviews and \ninterrogation and techniques within the rules of warfare, we have been \nable to prevent another attack on this country--Lord be praised--for \nalmost 4 years now. It can happen again at any time.\n  I am proud of what our men and women are doing. I was at one of the \ncommittee hearings when a young lieutenant commander in the Navy \ntestified that the prosecutor blocked him from interviewing a witness. \nHe told him what to do. He told him he could only plead guilty.\n  I said: Sir, you are a lieutenant commander in the U.S. Navy--I was \nin a JAG officer slot. Unlike Senator Graham, I was not trained at the \nJAG officer school. But I had some training in it and taught the laws \nof warfare to our soldiers in the Army Reserve. At any rate, this guy \nsaid he was ordered by the prosecutor.\n  I said: I never heard of a defense counsel saying a prosecutor could \norder them around.\n  He said: Well, he told me I could not see the prisoner.\n  I said: You could not see the prisoner?\n  He said: Except at limited times.\n  It was out of this that he came up with this bizarre allegation that \nhe was somehow defending the terrorist. He was given a letter, and he \nsaid he could only represent him to plead guilty. The letter that \nappointed him to defend the guy said he was to represent him in all \ncategories. I was disappointed in the quality of his complaints. I \ndon't think they held up to be nearly what he was saying publicly. \nWhatever got into people's craw about how these matters were handled is \na bit out of whack.\n  Let's say this: The field manual is the manual that controls our \nhandling of a lot of things in the Army, including interrogation. But \nthe President of the United States is Commander in Chief of the \nmilitary, and these kinds of prisoners, as the witnesses told us in \ncommittee, were not contemplated when the field manual was written. \nDifferent techniques could be legitimate against them that would not be \nlegitimate against lawful combatants--the kinds of people we have seen \nso many times in the history of warfare. It is a weird thing. We should \nnot treat them inhumanely. It is an order of the President that we \ncannot. We cannot torture them. We have a criminal statute that defines \nthat and says you cannot do it. You can go to jail if you do.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I wonder if \nwe can line up some time at this point. I will not object, but after he \nis recognized, I believe then the majority has additional time for \nanother amendment going up to what time?\n  Mr. WARNER. We are operating under an original 1-hour agreement that \nwas modified to give 10 minutes to the Senator from Alabama. I think \nunder the original 1 hour the Senator from Virginia has time and the \nSenator from South Carolina has time. Would I be correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senator from \nVirginia has 9 minutes remaining. The Senator from South Carolina has \n10 minutes remaining. We still show the Senator from Arizona, Mr. \nMcCain, with 2 minutes remaining.\n  The Chair also notifies Senators that under the previous order, at 5 \no'clock, the Senate is to go to 30 minutes of debate on the Americans \nwith Disabilities resolution.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that is followed by a vote, is my \nunderstanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it is scheduled for 5:30.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nfollowing the completion of those three time periods on the Republican \nside, I be allocated 10 minutes on this side, which I will provide \nequally between the junior Senator from Michigan, the Senator from \nWashington, and myself, so that four amendments can be introduced and \nlaid aside.\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object, and I do not wish to \nobject, it seems to me that reality dictates that in 6 minutes we will \ngo on the ADA; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. In effect, the Senator from South Carolina, unless he \nwants to take the 6 minutes and put his amendment in, we would have to \ncome back to it at the conclusion of the ADA. Would that be acceptable?\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I don't want to stop Senator Sessions from finishing. I \ncan come back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent request right now is 2 \nadditional minutes for the Senator from Alabama.\n\n[[Page S8800]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, we have not had any time \nprior to the ADA matter, and it was intended that we have some time. \nThere is a prepared UC that would perhaps assist us, which has been \nhanded to us. I wonder if the manager will read this.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding the previous order, the Senate resume consideration of \nS. 207 at 5:15 today, with 15 minutes to debate under the control of \nSenator Harkin. I further ask that following the use or yielding back \nof the time, the Senate proceed to a rollcall vote on the resolution as \nunder the previous order.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, I ask that that be modified \nto allow 10 minutes between 5:15 and 5:30 to be granted to this side \nfor the introduction of those amendments. They will be introduced, with \na minute on each, and then set aside.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I believe that will accommodate our \ndistinguished colleague from South Carolina to introduce his amendment \nbeginning now, concluding at 5:10, at which time the Chair will \nrecognize the junior Senator from Michigan for a period not to exceed 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. No.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, can we include my 2 minutes?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The junior Senator from Michigan, 2 minutes; the Senator \nfrom Washington, 2 minutes; and me for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator modify the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. WARNER. I do so to accommodate Senator Levin. We have 2 minutes \nnow for the Senator from Alabama to complete his remarks before the \nChair recognizes the Senator from South Carolina; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request by the \nSenator from Alabama?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, does that include the UC \nwhich the Senator from Virginia read?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The separate unanimous consent request of the \nSenator from Virginia would incorporate that. There is one request for \n2 additional minutes for the Senator from Alabama; 9 minutes for the \nSenator from Virginia--\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, the Democratic leader is \ngoing to want 2 minutes prior to the vote on leadership time, or prior \nto 5:15. You all figure it out.\n  Mr. WARNER. We certainly want to accommodate the Democratic leader. \nThe Senator from South Carolina indicated that perhaps he would like to \ntake up his amendment following the vote, giving him then such time as \nhe requires, and giving the Senator from Michigan such time as he may \nrequire. So perhaps let us allocate the remaining time between now and \n5:15 between the Senator from Alabama, the two colleagues on that side, \nand the distinguished Democratic leader.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That is acceptable to me.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, following the completion of the rollcall \nvote, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from South Carolina be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Chair understands the now-modified \nunanimous consent request, it is a request that the Senator from \nAlabama be recognized for 2 additional minutes, the time between that \nand 5:15 would be the Senator from Michigan, and at 5:15, under the \nprevious order, the Senate would consider the Americans with \nDisabilities resolution, followed by a vote at 5:30, followed by the \nSenator from South Carolina being recognized to offer his amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Reserving the right to object, I would like to be able to \nstate some general areas of agreement and disagreement concerning \nSenator Sessions' statement. Is that possible when I introduce my \namendment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator will yield. We need only 7\\1/2\\ \nminutes before 5:15. I wonder if the chairman will agree to this: After \nSenator Sessions, go to the Senator from South Carolina for 5 minutes, \nand then come to me.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is acceptable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama is recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will try to conclude and sum this up.\n  This country was attacked by a very dangerous group of people. I \ncertainly respect my colleagues' concern and commitment that our \nprisoners be treated humanely and consistent with the rules of war. I \nhave also said that the rules of the Geneva Conventions do not apply to \nthese unlawful combatants. The field manual is an Army Department of \nDefense document that sets the rules for our conduct. But the DOD can \nalter that.\n  As I understand what this amendment would do, it would make the field \nmanual, with regard to the section involving interrogation and \nintelligence, the equivalent of law; that before the Army or Department \nof Defense could make any changes in those field manuals, somebody \nwould have to offer legislation in the House and the Senate, which \nwould be subject to a filibuster and maybe we could fix it and maybe we \ncould not. It becomes force of law. I think that is a mistake.\n\n  Finally, alterations in procedure by which these prisoners or \ndetainees were handled was done with review by the Department of \nJustice. We had Attorney General Gonzales, when he was White House \ncounsel and Attorney General, testify about how it came about and all \nthe legal research that went into it. We had the Department of Defense \nleadership discuss this. They reviewed it. The generals reviewed the \nheightened techniques personally, individually, and carefully on a \ncase-by-case basis, and they recommended this general at Guantanamo, \nMiller, be disciplined because these combination of events exceeded \nwhat was proper. It was overruled later, but that is how seriously they \ntake this.\n  I don't think this is the way to fix this situation. Some prisoners \nneed to be handled differently than others. We should not bind by law \nwhat the field manual states.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Under the \nunanimous consent agreement, the Senator from South Carolina is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to build on what Senator \nSessions said. If this amendment did the things suggested, I would \nsupport it. One, the Army Field Manual is being revised, as we speak, \nwith two groups in mind--lawful combatants and unlawful combatants. The \namendment says that the Army Field Manual be the guide in whatever form \nit is in. It does not lock in this version. They are going to have a \nversion part of it classified so our enemy does not have a chance to \nprepare for interrogation techniques that deal with lawful combatants \nand unlawful combatants.\n  The reason we are doing that is because what the JAGs told us over 2 \nyears ago. The common thread among our recommendations is concern for \nservicemembers.\n  If we put people on the line in this war in terror, we want to give \nthem everything they need as far as equipment. If we put people on the \nline in terms of handling detainees, we want to give them everything \nthey need, the tools to get good information, but what we do not want \nto do is put our own people at risk.\n  We are trying to armor all our vehicles. What we are trying to do \nwith the people who are holding these terrorists and interrogating them \nis not getting them in trouble. The Office of Legal Counsel, on 27 \nFebruary 2003, from a Marine general, not exactly the ACLU, said:\n\n       The common thread among our recommendations is concern for \n     our service members. The Office of Legal Counsel does not \n     represent the services, thus understandably concern for \n     service members does not reflect in their opinion. Notably, \n     their opinion is violent on the foreign views of \n     international law.\n\n  This is what the judge advocate general of the Army said:\n\n       I recommend the aggressive counterresistant interrogation \n     techniques under consideration be vetted with the Army \n     intelligence community before a final decision on their use \n     is made. Some of these techniques do not comport with Army \n     doctrine as set forth in the Field Manual, FM 34-52, \n     intelligence interrogation, and may be of questionable \n     practical value in obtaining reliable information of those \n     being interrogated.\n\n  What we are trying to do is have a guide our troops can understand \nwith\n\n[[Page S8801]]\n\ntwo parts--one for lawful combatants and one for unlawful enemy \ncombatants. We will know what the rules of the road will be. We are \nputting congressional approval on those rules.\n  We have had the White House, Congress, and eventually the courts \nsaying you can aggressively interrogate prisoners not covered by the \nGeneva Conventions. We have been all over the board for the last couple \nof years. We are trying to bring it together in symmetry where the \nmilitary can write the rules. They know better than I do. I am not \nsaying I am an expert on interrogations. They are going to write the \nrules the way they need to be written, and Congress is going to say you \nare good to go.\n  These JAGs were telling us you have confused concepts, so we are \ntrying to do away with that confusion to make it stronger, not weaker, \nto make us better at gathering intelligence and avoid the problems we \nhave had in the last 2 years.\n  I think it is a very smart thing to do. I look forward to trying to \nhelp change it if it needs to be changed, but nobody is locking the \nmilitary into a set of rules that does not allow them to aggressively \nget what they need to make us safe. We are trying to provide the \nmilitary and all those in charge of detainees clear guidance so they \nwill have the flexibility they need and we will not get our people in \ntrouble. That is what we have been working on for 2 years. We are at a \npoint where we can actually accomplish something that will be good for \nthis country, good for the military, and help win this war on terror. \nPart of this war is about image.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It did say ``not authorized in the field manual.'' But \nthe Senator from South Carolina interprets that to mean that the \nmilitary could amend it at any point in time.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Absolutely.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think that is more acceptable, but even then the \npolicies in the field manual should reflect the executive branch, it \nseems to me, being able to use extraordinary events and extraordinary \ncircumstances.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. And it will be. There will be a section that is specific \nfor unlawful enemy combatants. That is not a traditional way to deal \nwith them versus POWs.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMichigan has the time remaining up to 5:15 p.m. under his control.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to my colleague from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1435\n\n (Purpose: To ensure that future funding for health care for veterans \n        takes into account changes in population and inflation)\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my friend and distinguished \ncolleague. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment, \nand I call up amendment No. 1435.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Ms. Stabenow], for herself, Mr. \n     Johnson, Mr. Akaka, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Nelson of \n     Florida, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Salazar, Mrs. Lincoln, and Mr. \n     Corzine, proposes an amendment numbered 1345.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of July 23, 2005 under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, today's soldiers are tomorrow's \nveterans, and America has made a promise to these brave men and women \nto provide them with the care they need and deserve. Senator Johnson \nand I and others are offering an amendment today to provide full \nfunding for VA health care to ensure that the VA has the resources \nnecessary to provide quality care in a timely manner to our Nation's \nsick and disabled veterans.\n  The Stabenow-Johnson amendment provides guaranteed funding for \nAmerica's veterans from two sources. First, the legislation provides an \nannual discretionary amount that would be locked in for future years at \nthe 2005 funding levels and, second, in the future, the VA would \nreceive a sum of mandatory funding that would be adjusted year to year \nbased on the changes in demand from the VA health care system and the \nrate of health care inflation.\n  This is about whether we are going to fully support our brave men and \nwomen who are fighting today and have fought in the past and will fight \ntomorrow, whether we are going to continue to debate year to year \nwhether there is adequate funding for veterans health care or whether \nwe will make a statement in this bill that part of national defense is \nmaking sure that when our men and women come home and put on the \nveteran's cap, they will, in fact, be assured that the health care they \nneed will be there, not dependent on the Appropriations Committee \nentirely, not dependent on what happens year to year, but knowing there \nis a full commitment that we have made to them for veterans health \ncare.\n  I will speak further at a later time. I understand there are other \ncolleagues who wish to speak on other amendments. I simply ask \ncolleagues to support this very important commitment, keeping our \npromises to our veterans, starting with the fact that we say very \nloudly and clearly that veterans health care, in the full amount \nneeded, will be available to each and every one of our brave veterans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nWashington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1348\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay the \npending amendment aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \ncall up two amendments, and in the event cloture is invoked on the \nunderlying bill, I will ask for the yeas and nays on both amendments.\n  First, I ask unanimous consent to call up amendment No. 1348 and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1348.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To amend the assistance to local educational agencies with \n significant enrollment changes in military dependent students due to \nforce structure changes, troop relocations, creation of new units, and \n                        realignment under BRAC)\n\n       Strike section 582 of the bill and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 582. ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES WITH \n                   SIGNIFICANT ENROLLMENT CHANGES IN MILITARY \n                   DEPENDENT STUDENTS DUE TO FORCE STRUCTURE \n                   CHANGES, TROOP RELOCATIONS, CREATION OF NEW \n                   UNITS, AND REALIGNMENT UNDER BRAC.\n\n       (a) Availability of Assistance.--To assist communities \n     making adjustments resulting from changes in the size or \n     location of the Armed Forces, the Secretary of Defense shall \n     make payments to eligible local educational agencies that, \n     during the period between the end of the school year \n     preceding the fiscal year for which the payments are \n     authorized and the beginning of the school year immediately \n     preceding that school year, had (as determined by the \n     Secretary of Defense in consultation with the Secretary of \n     Education) an overall increase or reduction of--\n       (1) not less than 5 percent in the average daily attendance \n     of military dependent students enrolled in the schools served \n     by the eligible local educational agencies;

Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their \nconsideration. I will come to the floor later to discuss both of these \namendments, but essentially they deal with the children of our Guard \nand Reserve. I think all of us understand the impacts to families \nacross our country. Our members from home have been called up for Guard \nand Reserve duty.\n  The first amendment I offered will help schools handle the sudden \nchanges in student enrollment and help schools handle base closures, \ndeployment, and force realignments. And the second amendment will make \nsure our military students get the counseling and support they need. \nOur Guard and Reserve families are spread across our States, not \nnecessarily close to a base, and the schools are impacted across this \ncountry. When they are impacted, our children are impacted.\n  Both of these amendments will help all of our students in our schools \nmake sure they reach the goals we all desire. I will be here again \nlater to talk about both of these amendments. I thank the managers for \ntheir consideration in allowing me to call them up at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1494\n\n(Purpose: To establish a national commission on policies and practices \n        on the treatment of detainees since September 11, 2001)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I call up amendment 1494, cosponsored by Senators Kennedy, \nRockefeller, and Reed of Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for himself, Mr. \n     Kennedy, Mr. Rockefeller, and Mr. Reed, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1494.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment would establish an \nindependent commission on the treatment of detainees in Afghanistan, \nIraq, Guantanamo, and elsewhere. U.S. policies, and too often \npractices, in the treatment of detainees have veered off the course \nwhich was established by decades of U.S. leadership in international \nhumanitarian law and has been a champion of the Geneva Conventions on \nthe treatment of prisoners of war and other detainees.\n  Our troops serve honorably and courageously across the globe. Their \nhonor is besmirched when some of those who are captured are abused. Our \ntroops' future security is jeopardized when people we detain are not \ntreated as we rightfully insist others treat our troops when they are \ncaptured.\n  The amendment we are proposing today would help reaffirm the values \nwe cherish as Americans. It would protect our troops should they be \ncaptured. It is going to be argued that there have been dozens of \ninquiries and hundreds of interviews and thousands of pages provided to \nCongress, but the fact is that huge gaps and omissions remain.\n  First, we do not know the role of the CIA and other parts of the \nintelligence community in the mistreatment of detainees or what \npolicies apply to these intelligence personnel.\n  Second, we do not know what the policies and practices of the United \nStates are regarding the rendition of detainees to other countries \nwhere they may be interrogated using techniques that would not be \npermitted at U.S. detention facilities.\n  Third, we have insufficient information on the role of contractors in \nU.S. detention and intelligence operations.\n  Fourth, the detention and interrogation of detainees by special \noperations forces need close examination.\n  Fifth, we are still missing key documents, including legal documents, \nfrom the Office of Legal Counsel.\n  Sixth, there are just too many significant questions which have been \nleft unanswered.\n  I hope we can appoint an independent commission on the treatment of \nthese detainees, on policies involved, patterned after the 9/11 \nCommission. We owe it to our military personnel who might someday be in \nenemy custody to demonstrate our commitment to the humane treatment of \ndetainees, to strengthen our standing, to object and to take \nappropriate action against anyone who would mistreat an American \nprisoner of war.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wonder if I might bring to the attention \nof the Senate that we now have 215 amendments offered on this bill; 27 \namendments have been proposed and are pending, a number desiring to \nhave rollcall votes. I know of five rollcall votes that I think are \nready to go. I ask the Senator, might we advise our leaders that we can \ncontinue tonight with rollcall votes and hopefully that can be \nfacilitated.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would have to check with our leadership on that. In \nterms of continuing tonight, I surely would be happy to do that, but \nlet me check with our leaders.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague because it is \nimportant that we keep momentum going forward on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I mentioned to Senator Warner I would be \nsaying this. He suggested the possibility of votes tonight. My response \nto him privately, and now publicly, is we would be happy to try to see \nif we could work out additional amendments that are pending where we \ncould agree on rollcall votes tonight. I will work with Senator Warner \nto see if those amendments can be identified mutually during this \nrollcall vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/25/senate-section/article/S8803-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8803-S8805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      HONORING 15TH ANNIVERSARY OF AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 5:15 \nhaving arrived, there will be 15 minutes for\n\n[[Page S8804]]\n\ndebate on the Americans with Disabilities resolution. The Senator from \nIowa will control 15 minutes.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, in remarks on the floor this morning I spoke about the \nremarkable progress that we have made since the Americans with \nDisabilities Act became law 15 years ago tomorrow. Today, the physical \nimpact of ADA's quiet revolution is all around us. Sidewalks are \nequipped with curb cuts allowing access for people using wheelchairs. \nNew buildings are outfitted in countless ways with ramps, wide doors, \nand large bathroom stalls to accommodate people with disabilities. Many \nbanks have talking ATMs to assist individuals who are blind. Service \nanimals are welcome in restaurants and shops, and on and on.\n  For those of us who are able-bodied, these changes are all but \ninvisible. For a person with a disability, they are transforming and \nliberating. So are provisions in the ADA outlawing discrimination \nagainst qualified individuals with disabilities in the workplace, and \nrequiring employers to provide reasonable accommodations.\n  The ADA is about designing our policies and also our physical \nenvironment so that America can benefit from the contributions of all \nof our citizens. The ADA is about rejecting the false dichotomy between \ndisabled and abled. It is about recognizing that people with \ndisabilities, like all people, have unique abilities, talents, and \naptitudes and that our country, that our America, is better, fairer and \nricher when we make full use of those gifts.\n  Last week, in anticipation of this 15th anniversary, I asked people \nfrom all across America to send stories about how their lives are \ndifferent today thanks to the Americans with Disabilities Act. I wanted \nto find out what the ADA means to people in their everyday lives.\n  I want to recite some of those.\n  Before I do, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Cantwell and \nVoinovich be added as original cosponsors of S. Res. 207.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. One young woman whose name is Cheri Blauwet wrote me and \nsaid:\n\n       I am a paraplegic as the result of a farming accident when \n     I was 15 months old. I am now 25 years old and am currently a \n     medical student at Stanford University in addition to being a \n     wheelchair racer on the United States Paralympic Team. My \n     ultimate goal is to become a physician and to work \n     internationally to provide sport and physical activity \n     opportunities to my peers with disabilities.\n\n  She continued:\n\n       I was 10 years old when the ADA was passed in 1990. \n     Although I didn't know it at that time, my realization of my \n     own talents and capacities would be shaped on this fateful \n     day. As I grew into adulthood, I attended a public university \n     and had an accessible dorm room and classrooms that were \n     wheel chair friendly. I received financial assistance from \n     the state Vocational Rehabilitation program. I was able to \n     apply for jobs, scholarships, and schools and to know I would \n     be viewed without discrimination. My ability to easily take \n     buses, trains, and airplanes led me to domestic and global \n     travel for the purposes of building my sports and medical \n     careers. I knew that something as simple as a set of stairs \n     would not stop me from achieving my life goals.\n\n  A woman from Chicago who uses a wheelchair and works for the Federal \nReserve wrote the following:\n\n       I am part of the first generation of Americans with \n     disabilities to grow up with the ADA in effect, and as a \n     result, it never crossed my mind that going to college, \n     studying abroad, or working in a big city would be impossible \n     for me. I knew these goals would be challenging--as they \n     would be for anyone. But I also knew they were possible, in \n     part, because of the ADA. The law laid the groundwork to make \n     this country more accessible for everyone, and it gave me the \n     access I need to do the things I'm capable of doing. For \n     example, I need accessible transportation to go to work so I \n     can afford my apartment. My apartment is located near a city \n     bus line, and all of the buses have lifts to accommodate my \n     wheelchair. ADA helped to make these necessities available to \n     me and others with disabilities, giving us more opportunities \n     than ever before to be active members of the community. It's \n     hard for me to imagine what my life would be like without the \n     ADA and without the accessibility I take advantage of every \n     day.\n\n  An individual from Laramie, WY, wrote:\n\n       The ADA has made a tremendous impact in my life. The \n     ability to go into a store to shop, or to travel, and to find \n     a place to stay have been the largest differences I've \n     experienced. Now, when I find a place of business that I \n     can't get into or get around in because of my wheelchair, \n     it's the exception rather than the rule. In 1990, in Wyoming, \n     the number of businesses I couldn't get into, or get around \n     in, far outnumbered the number of businesses that were \n     accessible. That has changed. Many have added ramps, \n     doorbells, or simply rearranged displays to make wider \n     aisles.\n\n  An individual with a spinal cord injury from St. Paul, MN, wrote:\n\n       I'm 32. Growing up, I was never sure whether I would be \n     employed. Thanks to the ADA, I received accommodations to \n     enable me to earn a B.A. and a J.D. I passed the bar in 1998, \n     thanks to accommodations received under the ADA. One of my \n     first jobs was clerking for a district court judge. Under the \n     ADA, the court provided me with assistive technology to \n     enable me to write judicial opinions and orders. The ADA has \n     made a tremendous difference in my life, both personally and \n     professionally. The ADA has enabled me to participate in \n     every facet of daily life, including the mundane things like \n     going to a movie or staying at a hotel. I can't imagine what \n     my life would be like if this law had not passed.\n\n  A woman who has an 11-year-old son with a disability wrote:\n\n       I am thankful for the ADA each time we pull into a \n     handicapped parking space, hit the automatic door to the \n     building, and can move around due to widened doorways. Each \n     time we go into a movie theater and don't have to sit on the \n     very front row. Each time we go to a theme park show where we \n     don't have to sit in the very back row.\n\n  Those are just a few of the many letters. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the remainder of the letters I have be printed in the Record at \nthis point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n       A woman with multiple disabilities wrote: ``Without the \n     ADA, I would either be on welfare or Social Security, unable \n     to support myself. Thanks to the ADA, I am a tax-paying \n     citizen helping to support others, living in my own little \n     home which I bought myself, paying for my own car, bills and \n     medicine. The ADA has helped me to secure meaningful \n     employment. In the 70's and 80's, when I was hard of hearing \n     with hearing aids, I had a very difficult time finding and \n     holding jobs because I was not able to hear on the phone, and \n     most often misunderstood verbal instruction. I could often \n     only find jobs paying the minimum wage. Now, though, thanks \n     to the ADA, I am happily employed with an employer who \n     recognizes me for my abilities, not my limits.''\n       A German woman with a disability wrote the following: \n     ``Although I am not an American with a disability but a \n     German with a disability, the ADA had an impact on my life. \n     The United States is one of my favorite countries for \n     traveling. Why? I am a wheelchair user and I enjoy having no \n     problems finding an accessible hotel. I don't have any \n     trouble finding accessible restrooms, and I never have any \n     problems visiting museums, parks, attractions and public \n     buildings. There are many more parking spaces for the \n     disabled than in Europe. And if I book my flight at an \n     American airline, there will be no stupid questions--I am \n     just a passenger who uses a wheelchair. No big deal! I try to \n     travel to US at least once a year, because of the ADA. It \n     means seamless travel to me.''\n       And one final story. A man from Minnesota with a spinal \n     cord injury wrote the following: ``Six years ago, my spine \n     was severed in a car accident. In that one afternoon I went \n     from being a positive and productive husband, father, and \n     worker in the U.S. to spending months at the Mayo Hospitals. \n     Before that time I didn't know or think much about the ADA. \n     Since my accident I have remained a positive husband not just \n     the right to be independent and have a job, but the \n     wherewithal to be independent and hold a job.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, shortly we are going to have a vote on a \nresolution commending the 15th anniversary of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act and all it has achieved for our society. It truly has \nopened the doors and torn down the walls of segregation and \ndiscrimination and the denial of equal opportunity for people with \ndisabilities.\n  As I said this morning, after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 passed, we \nthought we had done a great thing, and indeed we had. But for a large \ngroup of Americans with disabilities, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 left \nthem out because they still faced segregation on a daily basis. They \nfaced discrimination on a daily basis; they faced inequality of \nopportunity on a daily basis. So the Americans with Disabilities Act, \nsigned into law on July 26, 1990, finally accorded to Americans with \ndisabilities every right that every American ought to have. That is the \nright to live independently, the right to have equality of opportunity, \nthe right to have economic self-sufficiency, and the right to be \naccorded full participation in our society. Those are the four goals of \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act, and now we see the evidence all \naround us.\n\n[[Page S8805]]\n\n  On July 26, 1990, when he signed the Americans with Disabilities Act \ninto law, President George Herbert Walker Bush spoke with great \neloquence, and I will never forget his final words before taking up his \npen.\n  He said, ``Let the shameful wall of exclusion finally come tumbling \ndown.''\n  Today, that wall has indeed fallen. We must continue this progress. \nWe must go forward and not backward.\n  As I said this morning, we have come a long way in making sure people \nwith disabilities are able to participate in American society. We see \npeople in restaurants, traveling, in theaters and sports arenas, people \nwith jobs, people going to school, people becoming lawyers and doctors \nand everything else, regardless of their disability, and it is a \nwonderful thing for our country. It has made us a better, richer, and \nfairer country.\n  We only have one other thing that we have to do. We have to make sure \npeople with disabilities have personal attendant services so they can \ngo to work. Right now, 15 years after the Americans with Disabilities \nAct, over 60 percent of people with disabilities are unemployed, no \njob. Many of them can have a job if they just have some personal \nattendant services to help them get going in the morning or help them \nat night, maybe help them on their job. As taxpayers we know this will \ncost us less money than institutionalizing people, and it will make \ntheir lives and our lives better.\n  One final thought. As chairman of the Disability Policy Subcommittee, \nI brought the Americans with Disabilities Act to the floor in 1990. \nRight after it was passed, I spoke in sign language from this desk down \nhere about what this would mean for people like my brother Frank who \nwas deaf. So I will close my remarks today by using another sign. I \nwill not speak at all in sign language, but I would like to close by \nsaying that there is a wonderful sign--see, sign language is very \nexpressive. There is a wonderful sign in sign language for ``America.'' \nI am going to teach it right now to Senators who are watching. The sign \nfor ``America'' in sign language is where one puts all of their fingers \ntogether like this, intertwined, and makes a circle. That is the sign \nfor America, all of the fingers intertwined, one family in a closed \ncircle. It is a beautiful sign. It really expresses volumes about \nAmerica.\n  Fifteen years ago, not all of those fingers were there. People with \ndisabilities were not part of that family. Now they are. So our family \nin America is more complete, the circle is more complete because of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act. For centuries they were excluded. \nPeople were excluded from our family. Now they are a part of our \nfamily, and it has made us a better, fairer, and richer country.\n  So I hope all Senators will give a strong vote of approval to this \nresolution; one, to recognize the advances that we have made; second, \nto recommit ourselves to make sure that we will not go backward but \nthat we will continue forward to even break down more barriers, to \nbecome even more inclusive, to make sure that every single person with \na disability is a member of that American family.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 207) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the preamble is \nagreed to and the motion to reconsider is laid upon the table.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 207\n\n       Whereas July 26, 2005, marks the 15th anniversary of the \n     enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990;\n       Whereas prior to the passage of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act, it was commonplace for individuals with \n     disabilities to experience discrimination in all aspects of \n     their everyday lives--in employment, housing, public \n     accommodations, education, transportation, communication, \n     recreation, voting, and access to public services;\n       Whereas prior to the passage of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act, individuals with disabilities often were \n     the subject of stereotypes and prejudices that did not \n     reflect their abilities, talents, and eagerness to fully \n     contribute to our society and economy;\n       Whereas the dedicated efforts of disability rights \n     advocates, such as Justin Dart, Jr. and others too numerous \n     to mention, served to awaken Congress and the American people \n     to the discrimination and prejudice faced by individuals with \n     disabilities;\n       Whereas Congress worked in a bipartisan manner to craft \n     legislation making such discrimination illegal and opening \n     doors of opportunity to individuals with disabilities;\n       Whereas Congress passed the Americans with Disabilities Act \n     and President George Herbert Walker Bush signed the Act into \n     law on July 26, 1990;\n       Whereas the Americans with Disabilities Act pledged to \n     fulfill the Nation's goals of equality of opportunity, \n     economic self-sufficiency, full participation, and \n     independent living for individuals with disabilities;\n       Whereas the Americans with Disabilities Act prohibited \n     employers from discriminating against qualified individuals \n     with disabilities, required that State and local governmental \n     entities accommodate qualified individuals with disabilities, \n     encouraged places of public accommodation to take reasonable \n     steps to make their goods and services accessible to \n     individuals with disabilities, and required that new trains \n     and buses be accessible;\n       Whereas since 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act has \n     played an historic role in allowing some 54,000,000 Americans \n     with disabilities to participate more fully in our national \n     life by removing barriers in employment, transportation, \n     public services, telecommunications, and public \n     accommodations;\n       Whereas accommodations such as curb cuts, ramps, accessible \n     trains and buses, accessible stadiums, accessible \n     telecommunications, and accessible Web sites have become \n     commonplace since passage of the Americans with Disabilities \n     Act, benefitting not only individuals with disabilities but \n     all Americans; and\n       Whereas the Americans with Disabilities Act is our Nation's \n     landmark civil rights legislation for people with \n     disabilities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes and honors the 15th anniversary of the \n     enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990;\n       (2) salutes all people whose efforts contributed to the \n     enactment of such Act; and\n       (3) encourages all Americans to celebrate the advance of \n     freedom and the opening of opportunity made possible by the \n     enactment of such Act.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my understanding is that the Senate now \nreturns to the Defense authorization bill. Is that the pending \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1477\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1477 and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nlaid aside. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1477.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To make oral and maxillofacial surgeons eligible for special \n   pay for Reserve health professionals in critically short wartime \n                              specialties)\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title VI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 624. ELIGIBILITY OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGEONS FOR \n                   SPECIAL PAY FOR RESERVE HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IN \n                   CRITICALLY SHORT WARTIME SPECIALTIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 302g(b) of title 37, United States \n     Code, is amended by inserting ``, including oral and \n     maxillorfacial surgery,'' after ``in a health profession''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect on October 1, 2005.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment, and \nit is going to add one more category to those who will be able to \nreceive special incentive pay for signing up to come in to serve our \nmilitary in the medical field. This field is oral surgery. Those who \nare deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan and other military theaters have \ncritical needs for oral surgery. Complex facial trauma comes with \nbattlefield injuries.\n  In addition to being on the ground in mobile surgical hospital units, \noral surgeons are serving on every aircraft carrier to provide \nessential facial reconstruction and trauma care. These surgeons are \nindispensable military personnel who provide a unique and necessary \nrole in caring for our troops. Unfortunately, this valuable role is \nbeing threatened by an ever-widening compensation gap between military \nand civilian pay and the unlimited practice opportunities that oral \nsurgeons have in the civilian market. With a historical retention rate \nof 85 percent, a loss of 15 percent, recent statistics predict the \ncurrent retention rate for oral surgeons is closer to only 75 percent. \nEven more concerning, many of our military's oral surgeons are senior \nofficers who could retire at any time. In fact, if all oral surgeons \neligible for retirement were to retire next year, we could have a 50-\npercent reduction in this force.\n  As a means to recruit and retain essential specialties vital to \nmaintaining the military's readiness, the military offers a variety of \nspecial pay programs to supplement a specialist's base pay and to help \nclose the military-civilian pay gap. One such special pay program is \nknown as incentive special pay. Available to medical personnel, \nincentive special pay is a yearly bonus that is designed to bring the \nsalaries of military specialists into closer line with civilian \nspecialists. Although it doesn't get there, it does help. Applied at \ndifferent levels based on medical specialties, wartime role, and \nretention, incentive special pay ranges from now between $12,000 for \npediatrics to $36,000 for trauma surgery specialists. Ear, nose, and \nthroat specialists, the most comparable medical personnel to oral \nsurgeons, are eligible for incentive special pay around $30,000.\n  Although oral surgeons stand the same facial trauma watches as ear, \nnose, and throat specialists and provide the same critical head and \nneck trauma care as ENTs, they are not eligible for incentive special \npay. Often serving as the only head and neck specialist on aircraft \ncarriers and smaller hospitals, our oral and maxillofacial surgeons are \nproviding essential services for our troops in combat, services we \ncannot afford to lose.\n  Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the important \nand necessary role that oral surgeons are providing our military by \nmaking these surgeons eligible for incentive special pay. We can't \nallow the pay disparity between military and civilian oral surgeons to \nbecome so substantial that these necessary specialists retire from the \nservice or resign their commissions to be in private practice. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in allowing oral surgeons in uniform who are \nproviding critical trauma services for our troops in the war on terror \nto be eligible for incentive special pay just as many other medical \nspecialties are.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I know the Senator from Wyoming desires to address the \nSenate.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1342\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of amendment No. 1342, the \nSupport Our Scouts Act offered by my distinguished colleague from \nTennessee, Senator Frist. The amendment was intended to be simple and \nstraightforward in its purpose to ensure the Department of Defense can \ncontinue to support youth organizations, including the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica, without fear of frivolous lawsuits. The dollars that are being \nspent on litigation ought to be spent on programs for youth. Every time \nwe see a group such as the Boy Scouts that will teach character and \ntake care of community, we ought to do everything we can to promote it.\n  Last Saturday, over 40,000 Boy Scouts from around the Nation and the \nworld met at Fort A.P. Hill in Virginia for the National Boy Scout \nJamboree. This event provides a unique opportunity for the military and \ncivilian communities to help our young men gain a greater understanding \nof patriotism, comradeship, and confidence.\n  Since the first jamboree was held at the base of the Washington \nMonument in 1937, more than 600,000 Scouts and leaders have \nparticipated in the national event. I attended the Jamboree at Valley \nForge in 1957. Boy Scouts has been a part of my education. I am an \nEagle Scout. I am pleased to say my son was in Scouts. He is an Eagle \nScout. Boy Scouts is an education. It is an education of possibilities \nfor careers. I can think of no substitution for the 6 million boys in \nScouts and the millions who have preceded them. There are dozens on \nboth sides of the aisle who have been Boy Scouts. I say it is part of \nmy education because each of the merit badges that is earned is an \neducation. I tell school kids, as I go across my State and the country, \nthat even though at times I took courses or merit badges or programs \nthat I didn't see where I would have any use for them, I later wished I \nhad paid more attention at the time I was doing it.\n  I always liked the merit badge pamphlet on my desk called \nentrepreneurship. It is the hardest merit badge in Boy Scouts. It is \nalso one of the most important ones. I do believe that small business \nis the future of our country. Scouts promote small business through the \nentrepreneurship merit badge. Why would it be the toughest to get? Not \nonly do you have to figure out a product or a service, not only do you \nhave to do a business plan, not only do you have to find financing, the \ntoughest requirement is the final requirement, and that is that you \nactually have to start the business.\n  I could go on and on through the list of merit badges required in \norder to get an eagle badge. There are millions of boys in this country \nwho are doing that and will be doing that. They do need places to meet. \nThey are being discriminated against. They are being told they cannot \nuse military facilities even for their national jamboree. That is a \ntradition. These jamborees become a great American tradition for our \nyoung people, and Fort A.P. Hill has been made the permanent site of \nthe gatherings. But now the courts are trying to say that this is \nunconstitutional. It isn't just military facilities, it is Federal \nfacilities.\n  A couple of years ago, we had an opportunity to debate this on the \nSenate floor. It had to do with the Smithsonian. Some Boy Scouts \nrequested that they be able to get their Eagle Scout Court of Honor at \nthe National Zoo. \n\n[[Page S8807]]\n\nThey were denied. Why? The determination by the legal staff of the \nSmithsonian that Scouts discriminate because of their support for and \nencouragement for the spiritual life of their members. Specifically, \nthey embrace the concept that the universe was created by a supreme \nbeing, although we surely point out Scouts do not endorse or require a \nsingle belief or any particular faith's God. The mere fact they ask you \nto believe in and try to foster a relationship with a supreme being who \ncreated the universe was enough to disqualify them.\n\n  I read that portion of the letter twice. I had just visited the \nNational Archives and read the original document signed by our Founding \nFathers. It is a good thing they weren't asked to sign the Declaration \nof Independence at the National Zoo.\n  This happens in schools across the country. Other requests have been \ndenied. They were also told they were not relevant to the National Zoo. \nThat is a kind of fascinating experiment in words. I did look to see \nwhat other sorts of things have been done there and found that they had \na Washington Singers musical concert and the Washington premiers for \nboth the Lion King and Batman. Clearly, relevance was not a determining \nfactor in those decisions, but it was in the Boy Scouts decision.\n  The Boy Scouts of America has done some particular things in \nconservation that are important, in conservation tied in with the zoo. \nIn fact, the founder of the National Zoo was Dr. William Hornaday. He \nis one of the people who was involved in some of the special \nconservation movements and has one of the conservation badges of Scouts \nnamed for him.\n  If the situations did not arise, this amendment would not come up. \nBut they do. In 2001, I worked with Senator Helms to pass a similar \namendment requiring that the Boy Scouts be treated fairly, as any other \norganization, in their efforts to hold meetings on public school \ngrounds. This amendment clarified the difference between support and \ndiscrimination. It has been successful in preventing future unnecessary \nlawsuits. The Frist amendment is similar to the Helms amendment and \nwill help prevent future confusion.\n  Again and again, the Scouts have had to use the courts to assure they \nwere not discriminated against. I am pretty sure everyone in America \nrecognizes that if you have to use the courts to get your rights to use \nschool buildings, military bases, or other facilities, it costs money. \nIt costs time. This amendment eliminates that cost and eliminates that \ntime to allow all nationally recognized youth organizations to have the \nsame rights.\n  The legal system is very important, but it has some interesting \nrepercussions. Our system of lawsuits, which sometimes is called the \nlegal lottery of the country, allows people who think they have been \nharmed to try to point out who harmed them and get money for doing \nthat. It has had some difficulties through the Boy Scouts. I remember \nwhen my son was in Scouts, their annual fundraiser was selling \nChristmas trees. One of the requirements when we were selling Christmas \ntrees was that the boys selling the trees at the lot had to be \naccompanied by two adults not from the same family. I didn't understand \nwhy we needed all of this adult supervision. It seemed as if one adult \nhelping out on the lot would be sufficient. The answer was, they have \nbeen sued because if there is only one adult there and that adult is \naccused of abusing boys, they get sued.\n  So two adults provides some assurance that they won't get sued. The \ninteresting thing is, it was just me and my son. We still had to have \nanother adult in order to keep the Boy Scouts from being sued. They run \ninto some other difficulties with car caravans.\n  So the legal system of this country has put them in the position \nwhere they are doing some of the things that they are doing. The legal \nsystem of this country has caused some of the discrimination that is \ndone. It is something we need to correct.\n  This discussion of the Frist amendment is timely. U.S. District Judge \nBlanche Manning recently ruled that the Pentagon could no longer spend \nGovernment money to ready Fort A.P. Hill for the National Boy Scouts \nJamboree. The Frist amendment would ensure that our free speech \nprotections would also apply to the Boy Scouts of America.\n  The Boy Scouts of America is one of the oldest and largest youth \norganizations in the United States and the world today. The \norganization teaches its members to do their duty to God, to love their \ncountry, and to serve their fellow citizens. The Boy Scouts of America \nhas formed the minds and hearts of millions of Americans and prepared \nthese boys and young men for the challenges they are sure to face the \nrest of their lives. It is an essential part of America.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in defending the Boy Scouts from \nconstitutional discrimination by supporting the Frist amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before my distinguished colleague leaves \nthe floor, I regret to say that I just got a call from the Department \nof Defense in which I was advised that at the jamboree being held just \na short distance down 95 in Virginia, a power line collapsed, and at \nthe moment there is one deceased and five critically injured and an \nassortment of other problems associated with this.\n  So I am delighted that you gave that speech. I am a cosponsor of the \nbill. I support it. I was a Scout myself, and I got a lot out of it. I \nthink we ought to close this set of remarks out by offering our prayers \nand hearts and minds to this tragic accident that occurred an hour or \nso ago. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are still on the bill and speakers are \ncoming to the Senate floor.\n  At this time, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: What is the pending \nbusiness? Are we now on an amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on amendment No. 1477.\n  Mr. LOTT. Further parliamentary inquiry: Are we in a position where \nwe can discuss any amendment that has been offered and has been set \naside? For instance, amendment No. 1389 by Senator Thune?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is in order to discuss any amendment at \nthis time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator is free to go. He spoke with \nme. It is an important element before the Senate. The general subject \nis BRAC.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1389\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the chairman, Mr. Warner, the \nSenator from Virginia. I wanted to begin by congratulating him and \nSenator Levin for the bill they have produced from the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. I, frankly, had my doubts that we were going to be \nable to get the bill up at this time in a way that would have momentum \nand would get through to passage. I think they have succeeded in doing \nthat. The atmosphere is such that I believe we will pass the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  As the Senator from Virginia knows, I always made a window for him, \nwhen I had the opportunity to make that call. Sometimes it took 2 \nweeks. Sometimes we put it up against a recess. Sometimes we put it \ntogether with Defense appropriations. But it is of a high priority, and \nI would be delighted if I could see us pass this bill in an orderly \nfashion this week.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished leader. The \nSenator forgot the one time it was 5 weeks, but we got there.\n  Mr. LOTT. We did. I think the atmosphere is different now. The \nSenator understands and the American people understand that we are at \nwar, and terrorism is a very serious threat. We cannot expect homeland \nsecurity and our law enforcement agencies to do the job alone. This is \nbroader than that. We have to have a defense that is prepared to do the \njob at home and overseas. Certainly, we have called on our National \nGuard and Reserve to fill in, and they are doing a wonderful job. We \nhave to provide the additional authorization necessary to get the funds \nso\n\n[[Page S8808]]\n\nour men and women can continue to do the fine job they have done.\n  I thank the Senator for his cooperation on amendments that have been \naccepted and the language in the bill. I served on the Armed Services \nCommittee for a few years--I believe 6\\1/2\\ years. I enjoyed it very \nmuch. I always had a real interest in this area. I am happy to be on \nthe Intelligence Committee now. I am obviously interested in \nshipbuilding because of what it means to not only my hometown and my \nState but to our country, the Navy, and a lot of other issues you have \naddressed for our military.\n  I am worried about what we are having to expend and how we are having \nto expend things now because we have certain demands in Afghanistan and \nIraq for the Army and the Marines. I am concerned that in 5 or 10 \nyears, we will need to have a military that can address new and \nemerging threats. I think that is part of what this bill is about--to \ntry to begin to address some of those issues. I look forward to working \nwith the Senator.\n  I rise in support of Senator Thune's amendment No. 1389, which would \ndefer Congress's consideration of closure and realignment \nrecommendations that the President will forward to the Congress this \ncoming fall. This is not a new position for me. I have always been \nopposed to the Base Realignment and Closure Commission process. I \ngenerally don't like commissions. I have spoken against them on a \nnumber of subjects on the Senate floor. I probably will again before \nthe week is out. I think that is what we were hired to do. That is our \njob.\n  I get nervous sometimes that from Social Security, to tax policy, to \ndetainees policy, to intelligence, we basically say: Well, we cannot do \nthe job, so let a commission give us advice here. A commission can do \nit for us. Our attitude is see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil, \nsave us. But doing that difficult work is our job.\n  Up until recent years, we did our job and it worked. After World War \nII and Korea, certainly as the chairman knows, we closed bases in his \nState and mine. I can take you around Mississippi and show you those \nbases that were closed. How was it done? The Pentagon assessed their \nneeds, recognized the fact that we were not on war footing, and we had \nto begin to close some of those airbases in Greenwood, MS, and in \nMobile, AL, and make difficult recommendations, and Congress considered \nit and dealt with it. We did our job. Now we are in the fifth BRAC \nround, or something like that. I have opposed every one of them.\n  One day, I was walking up to the floor of the House of \nRepresentatives and this young Congressman from Texas named Dick Armey \ncame up to me as a member of the Rules Committee and said, ``I got this \nidea and I want you to talk to me about how I get it through the Rules \nCommittee.'' He would remember this. I told him, ``I don't agree with \nwhat you are trying to do, and I am absolutely going to vote against \nit. But if I were you, this is how I would do it.'' He did it, and it \nled to this BRAC process. Congressman Dick Armey from Texas went on to \nbe majority leader.\n  I voted against BRAC every time. Some people say: Wait a minute, you \nare just protecting your own bases; you are troubled because of bases \nin your own State. Not true. Not a single base has been closed in my \nState in these rounds. Contrary to popular opinion, we don't have a \nwhole lot of bases. We have been through every round, and we have been \nfortunate. The commissions have decided not to go forward with closing \nthose bases. So it is not that I have a grudge or that I am angry at \nanybody. I don't like the process, No. 1.\n\n  No. 2, this amendment doesn't kill the process. It allows the \nCommission to finish their independent and important work and forward \nthe recommendations to the President.\n  The amendment permits the President to submit a set of \nrecommendations to the Congress. At that point, the Congress would hold \nthe President's recommendations in abeyance, pending completion of \nseveral requirements that are critical to achieving a fully informed \ninteragency perspective of our basing requirements.\n  Here is my problem with BRAC this time. I don't like the process, No. \n1. No. 2, I think the timing could not be worse. At a time when we are \nin war in Iraq and, of course, have been and are still exposed in \nAfghanistan, a war on terror, with communities all over America having \nto cope with Reserve and Guard units from all of our States there on \nextended tours in Iraq, Afghanistan, or in the region, it has had an \nimpact on communities. They are already stressed, and they are asking \nthemselves, What next? Now you are going to come in and close my Air \nGuard unit or this hospital or you are going to do this or that. The \ntiming could not be worse. That is the second problem.\n  Next is I think this particular process, the way it is set up by the \nPentagon, is a lot less reassuring and messier and more unreliable than \nthe previous BRAC rounds have been. They have made significant \nmistakes. At a time, also, when we are looking at overseas alignment, \ntalking about reformation, I have serious questions about some of the \nPentagon's reformation plans.\n  So in instance after instance, I think we are making a mistake here. \nIt is going to have huge negative ramifications, and I think we are \ngoing to wake up later and find out, wait a minute here, we didn't \nevaluate the impact of the reduction of military medical services and \nwhat it means in the local communities. The local communities may not \nbe able to absorb that additional service. Who is going to serve these \nmilitary men and women? Or, wait a minute, you mean we are bringing \nthat heavy unit back from Europe? Where are we going to put them? Where \nare the spouses going to live? What are the quality of life facilities? \nIn some instances, they won't be there. This BRAC, in my opinion, is \nset up to be worse than all the previous rounds.\n  Senator Thune has done a very thoughtful job. He has allowed the \nprocess to go forward to a point where he will then put it on hold \nuntil some very important things are done.\n  The conditions that have to be met:\n  First, complete analysis and implementation of recommendations from \nthe Overseas Basing Commission. We have been talking about this, and we \nare planning on doing it. We are going to have realignment of where our \nunits are based in Europe. We are going to bring some units home, \nperhaps some heavy units. We are going to have to bring them somewhere. \nWe need to know what that is and where we are going to put them.\n  Second, submission of the Quadrennial Defense Review by the DOD to \nthe Congress, and that will be completed before very long--I think this \ncoming winter. Why don't we wait until we see what the needs and the \nplans are for the future? It would not cause an inordinate delay for \nthat in itself.\n  The next condition is that we complete deployment and implementation \nby the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security of the \nnational maritime security strategy and the homeland defense and civil \nsupport directive. It would have to be held until we get a submission \nof a report by the DOD to Congress to assess military installation \nneeds in view of the Overseas Basing Commission, returning troops, QDR, \nnational maritime strategy, and the homeland defense and civil support \ndirective.\n  And return of substantially all troops from Iraq. We need to weigh \nthe impact of what is going on in Iraq, when they will be coming home, \nand where they are going.\n  So those are the factors that would have to be considered before the \nCongress could actually act on the present recommendations.\n  When the Department of Defense released its BRAC recommendations last \nMay, it was very evident that many of the recommendations were flawed \nand developed in a vacuum. Their recommendations did not consider the \nimpact on other agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security \nor the Veterans' Administration.\n  The Department of Defense did not even involve the Governors of \nStates that would be affected by recommendations concerning Air \nNational Guard units. The Air Guard is under the Governors. I don't \nknow how they missed that turf. More than one counsel has advised the \nBRAC Commission that they cannot willy-nilly go in there and say they \nare shutting down this Air Guard unit. The Governor is going to have \nsome say in that.\n  I, along with many of my Senate colleagues, was also alarmed that DOD\n\n[[Page S8809]]\n\nused transformational options in lieu of military value as the \nframework for many of the recommendations. Even distinguished Chairman \nWarner noted in his testimony before the BRAC Commission, ``A number of \nthe Department's recommendations'' deviate substantially from the BRAC \nlegislative requirements in three important areas.\n\n       First, certain recommendations were justified by factors \n     and priorities other than the selection criteria in violation \n     of section 2914(f) [of the base closure law];\n       Two, certain recommendations were based on data that was \n     not certified as required by section 2903 [of the BRAC law];\n       Three, certain recommendations did not contain accurate \n     assessments of the costs and savings to be incurred by the \n     Department of Defense and other Federal agencies as required \n     by section 2913(e) [of the BRAC law].\n\n  The experience in my own State of Mississippi in looking at the \ninstallations was similar to what the great State of Virginia obviously \nobserved and experienced: that DOD recommendations were not based in \nfact and analysis was faulty. For example, for Keesler Hospital at \nKeesler Air Force Base, the cost for admitting patients was \nunderestimated by over $2,000 per patient. A math error decreased the \nmilitary value by 20 percent, and the Department of Defense ignored the \nfact that local VA facilities and community hospitals have no--none--no \nexcess capability.\n  Where are these military men and women going to go? It is a problem, \nit is a big problem for the local community and, more importantly, for \nthe military men and women who deserve quality health care.\n  Let me get even more simply to the statement of what happened. In one \nmilitary value critical category, for some reason they gave this \ncategory almost a zero rating. When they actually went back at our \nurging, they said that obviously a mistake was made, and that should \nhave been an 11 military value points instead of a zero. It moved that \ninstallation up 44 places. Little error? Big error.\n  There is a lot more embedded in this than we have been able to dig \nout even yet. Regarding the Navy Personnel Center at Stennis Space \nCenter, DOD mistakenly assumed that the building was a commercially \nleased property with no security perimeter. It is not. The personnel \ncenter is on a secure compound owned and operated by NASA and is the \nmodel of interagency cooperation. Just a little detail there. We have \nthis huge buffer zone. It is a totally secure facility, and they missed \nthat little point.\n  For Pascagoula Naval Station, DOD proposed to abandon a naval \npresence for 35 percent of our Nation's coastline, leaving unprotected \nover 30 percent of this Nation's gas and oil reserves, 60 percent of \nour trade sealanes, and 14 of America's largest 23 ports. But just 3 \nweeks ago, the Department of Defense issued a new policy stating that \ndefense of the homeland is their new No. 1 priority.\n  DOD's proposal to the BRAC Commission would mean we would not have a \nsingle naval port between the east coast of Florida at Mayport, FL, to \nSan Diego. It is all sitting there, a vast gulf with all kinds of \nsealanes and potential threats and future dangerous areas. But DoD says \nno presence at all is ok; that causes me a great deal of concern.\n  Even if DOD's work had been perfect, we should not be closing bases \nat home if we are engaged in armed conflict overseas. It is not fair to \nthe families of our service men and women who have to endure the \nuncertainty of where they will live and where their children will go to \nschool.\n  Closing bases right now is also detrimental to our war-fighting \nability. The Overseas Basing Commission has already noted that `` . . . \nto launch major realignments of bases and unit configurations at a time \nwhen we are in the midst of two major conflicts takes us to the edge of \nour capabilities.''\n  The Overseas Basing Commission also expressed concern that the \ndomestic BRAC is disconnected from the proposed closure of overseas \nbases, and DOD's budget is woefully inadequate to implement necessary \nchanges. These are some of the Commission's recommendations:\n\n     . . . adequate strategic sealift, airlift, and prepositioned \n     equipment and stocks do not exist . . .\n\n  And--\n\n     budgetary plans for mobility assets are inadequate to meet \n     projected lift demand--\n\n  When forces return from overseas.\n\n       We [intend to] reposition tens of thousands of family \n     members to localities that have not been given adequate time \n     or budget to prepare for their proper reception . . .\n        . . . DOD estimates the implementation of [global basing \n     changes] to be between $9 billion and $12 billion with only \n     about $4 billion currently budgeted in fiscal years 2006 \n     through 2011.\n\n  If it was just up to me, I would vote to kill this process right now. \nI have never liked it. I must admit, I have fought it three times in \nthe Senate and was almost able to kill it one of those times. It is an \nabrogation of Congress's responsibility to oversee basing and, if \nnecessary, to close excess bases.\n  DOD insisted on doing its BRAC assessment in a vacuum. We tried to \nfollow what was going on. We could not get the answers. But we, the \nCongress, are obligated to the American people to take a larger \nperspective.\n  Commissioner Principi and the entire BRAC Commission are doing a good \njob. They are doing honorable work right now to try to fix some of the \nfundamental flaws in DOD's set of recommendations. I want to make it \nclear, it is not that I don't have confidence in the chairman and the \nCommission. I do. I think they are a good quality group. But even the \nCommission can only do so much. The Commission is bound by a set of \nlegal constraints that did not anticipate DOD recommendations would \ndeviate from the laws so substantially.\n  So if we are not willing to stop this flawed process in its tracks, \nlet's do the next best thing. Senator Thune's amendment is a workable \ncompromise. It gives breathing room to take a larger view to consider \nour basing requirements in a global fashion and across all affected \nagencies. The distinguished Senators from Virginia and Michigan have \nboth said that we do need to close unneeded bases. I agree with that. I \nam not unrealistic. I know different times call for different things. I \nknow we have some duplication and overlapping, and we can have more \nefficiencies and we can consolidate.\n  I do know we are trying to change our forces to deal with where the \nchallenges may be, where our forces are more light, more mobile, and \nprepositioned. The problem is that many of the recommendations of the \nBRAC undermine the construct of lighter and more mobile and \nprepositioned. They do not mesh with what we are saying we should do \nhere, and what we are saying we do should do in reformation does not \nfit with making our troops lighter and more mobile and prepositioned. \nLet's not ride a flawed process into oblivion. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport Senator Thune's amendment so that we, the Congress, can make an \ninformed decision when we are asked to vote on the merits of closing \ndomestic bases. I think we will feel better about it.\n  I realize perhaps the die is cast. I tried last year with an \namendment to defer it for a couple of years. We got, I think, 44 votes \nor close to that. A couple votes who were absent, and we got close. In \nretrospect, that was the key vote. The opposition was effective, and \nthey won the day. And we have moved forward. I don't think we can turn \nback that clock, but I do think we can take a pause. We can take some \ntime to see if certain things are considered before we actually pull \nthis trigger and make some changes that we may regret.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if my distinguished leader would enter \ninto a little discussion with me, the Thune amendment, to which he has \nreferred in his remarks, apparently has been modified in a way that I \nwish to advise the Senate on this modification, as I read it. It is \nextraordinary.\n  The concept of BRAC only works if the President decides on the block \nof closures and sends it to the Congress to vote it up or down en bloc.\n  As I read this and I just read it for the first time a few minutes \nago I draw your attention to the page I handed the Senator from \nMississippi. It says as follows:\n  In the heading by striking ``congressional disapproval'' and \ninserting ``congressional action.'' In subparagraph A, by striking \n``the date on which the President transmits such report'' and inserting \n``the date by which the President is required to transmit such \nreport,'' and subparagraph B, by striking ``such report is \ntransmitted'' and inserting ``such report as required''--all\n\n[[Page S8810]]\n\nthis gets down to the following: that the Secretary may not carry out \nany closure or realignment--that is any of the number on the whole \nlist, any of them:\n\n       The Secretary may not carry out any closure or realignment \n     recommended by the Commission report transmitted by the \n     President pursuant to section 2903 if a recommendation for \n     such closure or realignment is specified as discussed by \n     Congress in a joint resolution partially disapproving the \n     recommendations of the Commission that is enacted before the \n     earlier of. . . .\n\n  It seems to me, as I read this, Congress can now go in and cherry-\npick base after base and pass a resolution to take it out.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator would allow me to ask, is \nthis a modification of the Thune amendment? Is this the Thune \namendment? This sounds similar to an amendment I heard discussed \nearlier as maybe one that was being suggested or considered by Senator \nCollins. It is not clear to me.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I may inquire at the desk, was there not a \nmodification put in by Senator Collins this morning, three amendments, \nand among them\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine called up three \namendments on behalf of the Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Thune. None \nof the amendments have been modified.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is an important point, I say to the Senator from \nVirginia. That is not my understanding of the Thune amendment. If a \nmodification along these lines were added to the Thune amendment, I \nwould have some reservations about that. I want to take a look at it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Let me point out, I say to my distinguished former \nleader, that the original Thune amendment that was offered, I think, \nThursday or Friday night and was the subject of a detailed colloquy \nbetween myself and the distinguished Senator from South Dakota, is \nstill at the desk, and then this amendment that I read to you is the \nfinal paragraph in an amendment which is identical in every way to the \none we discussed--Senator Thune and myself--on Thursday night.\n  With the exception of the last paragraph in that amendment, it has \nbeen changed to read the same as this one.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee, I would want to take a good look at the different amendments \nthat might be pending. I want to be sure I understood any modification \nor change to Senator Thune's amendment. The Thune amendment, as I \nunderstand it and as I described it in my remarks, is an approach which \nI think is good. I think what the chairman is saying about the idea \nthat Congress would start cherry-picking at this point from this list, \nI have my sincere reservations about that. That would be a messy thing \nto do without proper consideration. I would have a lot of reservations \nabout it. I would want to hear what the sponsors have to say. My \npredisposition is to be very hesitant about that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished leader. I cannot \nremember how many years he was in the House and how many years he has \nbeen in the Senate, but I have only been here 27.\n  Mr. LOTT. So long my memory has faded to the point I can't remember.\n  Mr. WARNER. If he had something such as this on the roll, he would \nhave a challenge----\n  Mr. LOTT. I think, if we should start to cherry-pick from this list \nor any list at this time, it would not be very wise.\n  Mr. WARNER. Give them the benefit of the doubt to find out, but this \nis at the desk right now. This is the moving target on this BRAC. I am \nstrongly in favor of the current BRAC law being implemented as it is \nwritten in the law, not deviating in any way. I cannot accept the \ndelay, I say to my distinguished leader, because there are too many \ncommunities burdened by all the expenses of lobbyists, and so forth, \nand the uncertainty that would throw onto the business community not \nknowing, with the Thune amendment, for maybe another 2 years whether \nthey are going to stay open.\n  Mr. LOTT. I certainly agree with that argument. I have a problem with \nwhy these communities and States have had to spend a lot of money on \nit. I thought that is what we were for.\n  Having said that, if you gave a lot of them a choice--have your base \nclosed or delay it for 2 years--I think I know what the answer would \nbe: Give me 2 more years to deal with the demands of this kind of \nchoice.\n  There have been instances where these closures have taken place and \nthe communities have done pretty well. The old Brookley Air Force Base \nin Mobile, AL--talking about a State other then my own--recently won a \ncompetition to assemble airbus airplanes there. I think they are making \npretty good use of it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am familiar with that.\n  These communities could not begin to attract new business, could not \nget new capital. They would become almost stagnated not knowing which \nway that decision would go. I thank my distinguished leader for his \nparticipation in this debate.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might advise the Senate, there was a \nUC in place whereby the Senator from South Carolina was to be \nrecognized for the purpose of bringing an amendment to the attention of \nthe Senate. He has been patiently waiting some period of time. I would \nlike to consult with the distinguished Senator from Michigan. I would \nlike to give the Senator from South Carolina the opportunity to \nproceed, but I would like to be aware of what the needs of the Senator \nfrom Michigan are in regards to his side.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my good friend from Virginia. I think Senator \nGraham was actually part of a UC.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is a part of the Record.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Right. So he has the right to go next.\n  I would ask, if it is convenient for the Senator from Florida, that \nafter Senator Graham, I will ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Florida be recognized to introduce his amendment at that time. I \nwonder if we could find out from Senator Graham about how long he \nexpects to be.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Less than 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, might I suggest that we take 15, and I \nwould like to have 5 of those minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Fifteen minutes, and the Senator from Virginia can have \n5; yes, sir.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Then I would make inquiry also from my friend from \nVirginia. I understand that the Republican TV monitor has already \nindicated no votes tonight. Is that correct?\n  Mr. WARNER. I am not aware of that. I have been on the floor. I know \nthat we checked with the Senator's side and there was some doubt as to \nwhether there could be votes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If we could work out votes, we were willing to do that, \nbut I think it is becoming clear that is not going to happen.\n  Mr. WARNER. In fairness to our colleagues, let us clear that up in \nthe course of the debate on the amendment of the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Might I ask from the Senator from Florida how much time he would \nlike?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator from Florida would need about how much time?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. At the Senator's great pleasure, 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Whatever the Senator needs is fine. Then I would be \noffering two amendments, if that is agreeable with the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Absolutely.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be introducing them immediately following the \nSenator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized \nunder the previous order.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think we had modified the previous order \nwith a new UC whereby the Senator from South Carolina gets 15 minutes, \n5 minutes under the control of the Senator from Virginia, and 10 under \nhis control, followed by the Senator from Florida for 10 minutes. Am I \nnot correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would note that is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1505, as modified\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent at this time to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 1505 and send it to the \ndesk with a modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S8811]]\n\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Graham], for himself, \n     and Mr. McCain, proposes an amendment numbered 1505, as \n     modified.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of subtitle G of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1073. AUTHORITY TO UTILIZE COMBATANT STATUS REVIEW \n                   TRIBUNALS AND ANNUAL REVIEW BOARD TO DETERMINE \n                   STATUS OF DETAINEES AT GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA.\n\n       (a) Authority.--The President is authorized to utilize the \n     Combatant Status Review Tribunals and a noticed Annual Review \n     Board, and the procedures thereof as specified in subsection \n     (b), currently in operation at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in order \n     to determine the status of the detainees held at Guantanamo \n     Bay, including whether any such detainee is a lawful enemy \n     combatant or an unlawful enemy combatant.\n       (b) Procedures.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the \n     procedures specified in this subsection are those that were \n     in effect in the Department of Defense for the conduct of the \n     Combatant Status Review Tribunal and the Annual Review Board \n     on July 1, 2005.\n       (2) Exception.--The exceptions provided in this paragraph \n     for the procedures specified in paragraph (1) are as follows:\n       (A) To the extent practicable, the Combatant Status Review \n     Tribunal shall determine, by a preponderance of the evidence, \n     whether statements derived from persons held in foreign \n     custody were obtained without undue coercion.\n       (B) The Designated Civilian Official shall be an officer of \n     the United States Government whose appointment to office was \n     made by the President, by and with the advise and consent of \n     the Senate.\n       (3) Modification of procedures.--The President may modify \n     the procedures and requirements set forth under paragraphs \n     (1) and (2). Any modification of such procedures or \n     requirements may not go into effect until 30 days after the \n     date on which the President notifies the congressional \n     defense committees of the modification.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) The term ``lawful enemy combatant'' means person \n     engaging in war or other armed conflict against the United \n     States or its allies on behalf of a state party to the Geneva \n     Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, \n     dated August 12, 1949, who meets the criteria of a prisoner \n     of war under Article 4 of that Convention.\n       (2) The term ``unlawful enemy combatant'', with respect to \n     noncitizens of the United States, means a person (other than \n     a person described in paragraph (1)) engaging in war, other \n     armed conflict, or hostile acts against the United States or \n     its allies, or knowingly supporting others so engaged, \n     regardless of location.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Very quickly, I appreciate the patience of the Senator \nfrom Florida and Chairman Warner.\n  Mr. President, this amendment deals with the concept called unlawful \nenemy combatant, a concept being used to detain about 500 people at \nGuantanamo Bay who have been captured throughout the world, many of \nthem on battlefields. It is a concept that goes back to World War II \nwhere the Supreme Court, during World War II, coined the phrase ``enemy \ncombatant'' to deal with some German saboteurs who were caught coming \ninto America in civilian clothes, with a plan to disrupt American life \nin the war operations.\n  These individuals--I think there were seven of them--were tried by \nmilitary tribunals. A couple of them were put to death. Some were given \nlengthy prison sentences. Then the Court recognized the concept of \nenemy combatant.\n  Fast forward 60 years. What do we find? We find ourselves in a war \nwith a group of people who are not part of a state or a nation. They do \nnot wear uniforms. They are terrorists. They hide among civilians. They \ncheat. They do anything one can imagine to have their way. They do not \nabide by any international regimes.\n  When we capture these people, we have made a decision as a nation to \nhouse them at Guantanamo Bay, a place run by the military. It has three \nfunctions: To interrogate foreign terrorists to get good information to \nmake sure that we are safer as a nation. Senator McCain has an \namendment to standardize the interrogation techniques. I think the \ncountry would be well served to have everything dealing with unlawful \nand lawful combatants in separate categories.\n  We want the Geneva Conventions to apply to people who are under it. \nWe do not want the Geneva Conventions to apply to terrorists. We want \nto do it right. We want our troops to not be confused. Senator McCain \nhas an amendment that would basically allow the Army Field Manual to be \nthe one source of law to deal with both categories, which would be a \ngreat benefit to the military and the country at large, in my opinion.\n  I have an amendment that gets Congress involved for the first time. \nIn a general way, the Congress authorized the President to go to war \nafter 9/11. A lot has happened since then, some good, some bad. I think \nit is now time for the Congress to weigh in on the issues that affect \nthis Nation in the war on terror. My amendment allows Congress to \ndefine ``unlawful enemy combatant'' in a very flexible way similar to \nwhat is being used at Guantanamo Bay now. It incorporates the \nprocedures that are used to classify and review enemy combatant status.\n  The way it works now, if the military or appropriate authority sends \nsomeone to Guantanamo Bay, the first thing that happens is there is a \nreview process where a determination will be made as to whether that \nperson fits the definition of ``unlawful enemy combatant.'' We are \ncodifying that procedure. We are accepting most of it. We are tweaking \nthe definition in line with Supreme Court cases that have reviewed this \nwhole subject matter.\n  That is another point I would like to make. There are about five \ncases in Federal court now dealing with issues like enemy combatant \nstatus, military commissions to try noncitizen foreign terrorists. The \nGovernment has won on most of these cases. But enemy combatant status \nneeds to be defined, in my opinion, by the Congress working in \nconjunction with the administration because courts will defer to a \nstatute much quicker than it will defer to anything else.\n  In one of these opinions, Justice Scalia has been telling us that \nCongress has been AWOL. Congress needs to get involved. So this \namendment allows the procedures in place at Guantanamo Bay to make the \ninitial determination, if one is an enemy combatant, to be authorized \nto be utilized by the President. Every year, a review is made of each \nperson's case. Every year the Government has to come and show that the \nenemy combatant status is still justified, that the person who is being \ndetained is not dangerous to us or our allies, or they no longer have \nany intelligence capability or intelligence value. At that point, they \ncan be released. Two hundred and something have been released. What we \nare trying to do with this amendment is to get Congress involved in \nthat process so that the courts will understand that Congress agrees \nwith the concept of unlawful enemy combatant and that the review \nprocess in place is a good process. I have made two changes.\n  One, I have addressed the issue of using statements that are derived \nfrom foreign interrogations. I do not think anybody in this country \nwants our Nation to be using evidence that may be tainted by torture or \nundue coercion. So I have a provision in there that says if a statement \nor information is used that comes from a foreign detention or a foreign \ninterrogation, we have to simply prove, where practical, that it is \nreliable, that it is not as a result of coercion. The courts will \nappreciate that, and I think the American public would appreciate that.\n  Second, we have a provision that the releasing authority, the person \nwho decides if someone can be released, should be confirmed by the \nSenate. Under Secretary England performs that function right now, but I \nthink it would be a good relationship to have the Senate involved in \npicking that person who has the ultimate authority to determine to let \nthese people go because 12 of them have gone back to the fight. Some \npeople who have been released have gone back to the war. Some people \nwho have been picked have probably been misidentified.\n\n  We are trying to get a procedure that the courts will accept, that \nwill be good for the country, that will keep terrorists off the \nbattlefield, that would withstand legal scrutiny and live up to the \nideals of who we are.\n  If Congress will get involved and legitimize unlawful enemy combatant \nstatus, it will pay great dividends to the operation at Guantanamo Bay \nbecause we will have the administration and the Congress on the same \nsheet of music and the courts will soon follow.\n\n[[Page S8812]]\n\n  My goal is to strengthen Guantanamo Bay, make sure that abuses in the \npast never occur again, have standardization of interrogation \ntechniques so our troops will not get in trouble so that we can get \ngood, reliable information. The military commissions are on track to be \napproved by the Supreme Court. We need a place to try these terrorists \nfor their crimes. If they are not being tried, they need to be kept off \nthe battlefield. Enemy combatant status does that. We need due process \nrights. We are a nation of laws. This amendment incorporates the due \nprocess that already exists with some improvement.\n  If we will do these things, Guantanamo Bay will be more effective in \nthe future. It will be a forward-looking, reform-type process. We will \nnot be captured by the mistakes of the past, and we will be a safer \nnation.\n  I appreciate Senator Warner's support and leadership on this issue. \nWe are trying in concert to make sure that we are stronger as a nation, \nnot weaker. We learn from our problems. We clean up some of the \nproblems we have had in the past and Congress finally gets involved. I \nthink the courts will appreciate that. I know the American public will.\n  With that, I will yield to Senator Warner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this is another very important step \nforward, drawing on the very profound remarks made earlier today by our \ndistinguished colleague from Arizona. The three of us have worked \ntogether.\n  I want to clarify one aspect because when I looked at the Senator's \nearlier draft, it appeared to me that a military judge being given to \nan unlawful combatant appearing before an administrative review board \nwould give that individual more due process than accorded a lawful \ncombatant, a POW. My understanding is the Senator's modification now \nembraces that concern, and I want to make that clear to our colleagues.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Why does the Senator not state it in his own words?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That is a very good point. Under the procedure in place \nnow, a military representative is provided to the enemy combatant \ninitially. When the determination is made whether someone is an enemy \ncombatant, our own rules provide a military representative. In an \nannual review, a military representative is given to the enemy \ncombatant to make their case that they are no longer a danger. What I \nwanted to do at the annual review is make that person a military lawyer \nbecause the potential of keeping these people there for a long period \nof time is great because unlike other wars dealing with traditional \nPOWs, there is nobody to sign surrender documents.\n  I can understand the Senator's concerns. We can deal with that issue \nlater. So we will go back to the old way of doing business. The lawyer \nrequirement will be taken out and we will go back to the procedures \nthat are in place now.\n  Right now, every unlawful enemy combatant has a military \nrepresentative to help them make their case about their status. We will \nnot make that person a military judge advocate. I think it would help \nus in court, but I do not believe it is that important. It will pass \nmuster with the courts in its current form, so that has been changed.\n  Mr. WARNER. Clearly, the unlawful has no advantages over, as we might \nsay, the lawful. They are on equal status, so to speak?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Geneva Convention would govern how we treat the \nlawful combatant. That is something we all understand and have been \nworking with for 60 years. The unlawful enemy combatant can now be \ndetained for an indeterminate period of time, once that determination \nhas been made, with an annual review required to see if they should be \nkept based on danger to our country that the person presents, and any \nintelligence data that they present.\n  So this legitimizes what the courts have been telling us to do. The \ncourts have said that an unlawful enemy combatant status determination \nis an appropriate legal concept as long as the person is given notice \nand the right to challenge. So what we are doing in this statute is \ntaking the court's directive and we are giving them notice and we are \ngiving them a right to challenge. A lawful combatant already has that \nunder the Geneva Conventions.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I ask that I now be \na cosponsor, with that modification.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Senator has made my day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the three of us, together with others who \nhave talked with us, I think, have made a very valuable contribution \nbecause all eyes are on America as to how we conduct these difficult \nsituations.\n  Tomorrow we will have an opportunity to further go into this question \nabout the use of the Army manual. My concern over that is that the \ncurrent manual, in my judgment, does not quite strike the balance \nbetween detention and interrogation. I am hopeful that we can draw from \nthe Department of Defense, as best we can, what the modification of the \nArmy manual would be.\n  If I can be assured that is going to be balanced and take into \nconsideration the need to address this unlawful category of these \nindividuals who are not acting on behalf of a State-sponsored \nconflict--am I not correct?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I say to the chairman, he is absolutely correct. It is a \nvery simple concept we are trying to achieve. There are two problems, \nthere are two groups of people we worry about for two different \nreasons. One group I worry about is the Americans in charge of these \ndetainees because we have all kinds of laws that we have adopted, for \n60 years, directing our people in how to treat folks who are captured--\nwhether they are lawful or unlawful. We have had policy statements and \ndirectives that are at best inconsistent, that are all over the board, \nfloating out there in legal cyberspace. We are trying to put into one \ndocument, the Army Field Manual, the rules of the road for both groups, \nlawful combatants and unlawful combatants.\n  We are not writing the field manual, we are not telling the experts \nwhat to put in the manual, how to write it, we are saying, for the sake \nof our own troops, you have one document you can go to now. And we are \nsaying to the world we are going to standardize our techniques. We are \nnot going to have inconsistent messages. The JAG memos we were talking \nabout a while ago that were 2 years old now are telling us if you get \ntoo far afield from what we have been doing for 60 years, you are going \nto get yourself in trouble. So the Army Field Manual will be one-stop \nshopping for all those responsible for detainees in both categories, \nand it will standardize procedures that will allow us to get good \ninformation, be aggressive, without losing who we are as a people. That \nis why we need this, in my opinion.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I do need to make certain that this \nmodification will treat the subject of how a person is detained with \nequal specificity as to how they are to be interrogated.\n  As you know from your experience of 20 years in the JAG--as a matter \nof fact, you and I went to Guantanamo a week or so ago. It is important \nthat detention be conducted in a way that it doesn't somehow influence \nhow the interrogation might go. I will not draw the picture here as to \nwhat could be done.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Absolutely.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from South Carolina, the amendments \nwhich you have offered and were cosponsoring with Senator McCain, \nSenator Warner, and others, do they make it clear that the policy of \nthe United States is not to engage in cruel, inhuman, and degrading \ntreatment of any prisoner in our control?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. It becomes a statute----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I can answer that. If you look at the \nsecond McCain amendment, basically that amendment is directed at that \nquestion. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That is absolutely right. It uses the terms the Senator \nhas just uttered and makes it a statutory\n\n[[Page S8813]]\n\nprohibition to engage in that conduct. It takes what the President \nsaid, we are going to treat people humanely, gets the Congress \ninvolved, and we are putting parameters around what we do with foreign \nterrorists, noncitizens. We can interrogate them, but we are not going \nto change who we are as a people, and the interrogators tell us that \nthe Army Field Manual--as we were down there a week ago--gives them all \nthe tools they need to aggressively pursue the interrogations. You \nreally don't get things out of torture. They do not believe it is good \npractice, to begin with, so you are absolutely right. There will be a \nprohibition in law as well as rhetoric.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes for the \nSenator from South Carolina or Virginia--whoever wants the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Florida for his patience, too.\n  If I can ask either Senator--both served in the military, and the \nSenator from South Carolina in the Judge Advocate General Corps--it \nstrikes me this is an important thing for our troops, to give them \nclarity, in terms of policy. I would ask the Senator from South \nCarolina if, in his visits to Guantanamo or visits with other military \npersonnel, he has found that sentiment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. This is absolutely giving clarity. What had been \nconfusing will now be clear, and it will be protection for the troops \nwho are having to administer the detainees, in terms of interrogation. \nThat is what Senator Warner said, in terms of detention.\n  The Marine Corps Judge Advocate, who was part of a review process 2 \nyears ago, said the one thing he thought policymakers were missing, or \nmisunderstood, was the effect on our own troops. Under the Uniform Code \nof Military Justice, it is a crime to abuse a detainee. So you are \ncreating a new model for interrogation, and you may be getting your own \npeople in trouble if you don't understand how the law exists already.\n  We are trying to reconcile those concepts; let the military tell us \nwhat they need and not put our own people at jeopardy. This will help \nGTMO in two regards: Get better, more reliable information that will \nnot give us a black eye and help the troops understand what their \nduties are.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say in closing to the Senator from South Carolina, I \nthank him for his leadership, along with Senators Warner and McCain. I \nknow better than most in this Chamber this is a very delicate issue, \nand I think they have handed it in a positive way, with clarity along \nthe lines we are drawing, so we protect America and protect our troops \nand give them clear guidance in terms of conduct that is acceptable and \nup to American's standard of value. I thank the Senator for his \nleadership.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for an additional question? And I \nask unanimous consent that I be allowed to proceed for 3 minutes with \nthe Senator from South Carolina, if the Senator from Florida will be so \ngracious.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I also commend the Senators who are involved in these \nproposals. These are extremely important proposals. I hope that they \nwould not be nongermane if, indeed, cloture is invoked tomorrow.\n  By the way, I wonder if I could ask the Chair whether or not the \npending amendment would be germane, if cloture is invoked?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would note there is not sufficient \ninformation at this time to make that determination.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator allow me to address the Senate on a \nseparate matter for 1 minute? On the subject of cloture, my leader, \nSenator Frist, and I will confer in the morning and then confer with \nthe Democratic leader himself. At the moment, it is not a matter of \nabsolute certainty, even though it ripens, as to whether the leader \nwill wish to pursue it.\n  Also, we would like to advise all Senators there will be no more \nvotes tonight, if you concur in that?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have no objection.\n  Mr. WARNER. The assistant Democratic leader is here.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I can go back and make inquiry of my good friend from \nSouth Carolina, I think he has focused, along with the cosponsors, on \nsomething which is critically important, and that is reliance on the \nArmy manual so everybody knows the roadmap, as he puts it.\n  Is it the Senator's understanding of the Army manual that abusive and \ndegrading treatment would be prohibited?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. It is not only my understanding, it is also part of the \nUniform Code of Military Justice. There is a specific section that \nmakes it a crime to abuse a detainee or a prisoner.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The reason this comes up is those words have now been \nutilized by a witness, by somebody who has made investigation. So I \nwant to be as precise as I can, in my question, about whether it would \nbe the belief of the Senator from South Carolina that abusive and \ndegrading treatment would be a violation of the manual?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. It is my understanding that the Army Field Manual, as \nwritten--and it is being revised--rejects that concept in interrogation \nof abusive and degrading behavior. I am not an expert on the terms of \nit. But the whole point of these amendments also is to make sure that \nwe have standardized interrogation techniques that get good information \nwithout having to be abusive and degrading. But you can be forceful. \nYou can be stressful. You can be psychologically and physically \nstressful under the Army Field Manual without crossing the line that we \nare all concerned about.\n  That is exactly what we did. We had confusing messages--if I may \ncontinue for a second--to our troops. We had a DOJ memo that was a \nbasic departure from the way we have lived as a nation for 60 years. \nUnderstandably, after 9/11 we wanted to be aggressive. But the JAGs in \nquestion told us: Don't go down this road too far because we have \ntrained people for 60 years to do it one way. It works that way. And \nyou are going to confuse our own troops.\n  Lo and behold, that's exactly what happened. So we are trying to get \nit back to where we have been.\n  We fought World War II, Hitler--a pretty bad guy--using these \nconcepts. We can fight these terrorists using these concepts.\n  My goal, and I am sure it is your goal, is to kill them if we have \nto, capture them, interrogate them, detain them and prosecute them and \ndo all that without giving up who we are as a nation.\n  We can do that. This is a step in that direction.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Again, I commend my friend from South Carolina. I am glad \nwe have the reassurance that he would consider at least abusive and \ndegrading treatment to be inhumane treatment within the meaning of \nthose words. I thank him, and I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 762\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired. The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I want to talk about widows and \norphans. I call up amendment No. 762, which is filed at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Nelson], for himself and Mr. \n     Hagel, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Smith, Ms. \n     Cantwell, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Landrieu, Ms. Mikulski, \n     Mrs. Murray, Ms. Stabenow, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Durbin, \n     Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Johnson and Mr. Salazar proposes an \n     amendment numbered 762.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To repeal the requirement for the reduction of certain \n    Survivor Benefit Plan annuities by the amount of dependency and \n  indemnity compensation and to modify the effective date for paid-up \n               coverage under the Survivor Benefit Plan)\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title VI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 642. REPEAL OF REQUIREMENT OF REDUCTION OF SBP SURVIVOR \n                   ANNUITIES BY DEPENDENCY AND INDEMNITY \n                   COMPENSATION.\n\n       (a) Repeal.--Subchapter II of chapter 73 of title 10, \n     United States Code is amended--\n       (1) in section 1450(c)(1), by inserting after ``to whom \n     section 1448 of this title applies'' the following: ``(except \n     in the case of a death as described in subsection (d) or (f) \n     of such section)''; and\n\n[[Page S8814]]\n\n       (2) in section 1451(c)--\n       (A) by striking paragraph (2); and\n       (B) by redesignating paragraphs (3) and (4) as paragraphs \n     (2) and (3), respectively.\n       (4) as paragraphs (2) and (3), respectively.\n       (b) Prohibition on retroactive benefits.--No benefits may \n     be paid to any person for any period before the effective \n     date provided under subsection (e) by reason of the \n     amendments made by subsection (a).\n       (c) Prohibition on recoupment of certain amounts previously \n     refunded to SBP recipients.--A surviving spouse who is or has \n     been in receipt of an annuity under the Survivor Benefit Plan \n     under subchapter II of chapter 73 of title 10, United States \n     Code, that is in effect before the effective date provided \n     under subsection (e) and that is adjusted by reason of the \n     amendments made by subsection (a) and who has received a \n     refund of retired pay under section 1450(e) of title 10, \n     United States Code, shall not be required to repay such \n     refund to the United States.\n       (d) Reconsideration of optional annuity.--Section \n     1448(d)(2) of title 10, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following new sentences: ``The \n     surviving spouse, however, may elect to terminate an annuity \n     under this subparagraph in accordance with regulations \n     prescribed by the Secretary concerned. Upon such an election, \n     payment of an annuity to dependent children under this \n     subparagraph shall terminate effective on the first day of \n     the first month that begins after the date on which the \n     Secretary concerned receives notice of the election, and, \n     beginning on that day, an annuity shall be paid to the \n     surviving spouse under paragraph (1) instead.''.\n       (e) Effective date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall take effect on the later of--\n       (1) the first day of the first month that begins after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act; or\n       (2) the first day of the fiscal year that begins in the \n     calendar year in which this Act is enacted.\n\n     SEC. 643. EFFECTIVE DATE FOR PAID-UP COVERAGE UNDER SURVIVOR \n                   BENEFIT PLAN.\n\n       Section 1452(j) of title 10, United States Code, is amended \n     by striking ``October 1, 2008'' and inserting ``October 1, \n     2005''.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, it is an honor for me, on \nbehalf of some folks who have not been treated with fairness and \nequity, to rise on the floor of the Senate to try to obtain it for \nthem. There will be attempts to strip this amendment from the bill. But \nI offer it tonight, whether or not cloture is invoked on the overall \nbill, with the hope that we are going to get an up-or-down vote. It is \nimportant that widows and orphans in this country, whose husbands and \nfathers died as a result of their military service, can know where the \nSenators stand on this important issue. It is an honor for me to offer \nthis amendment, and it is going to correct two important inequities \nfaced by our military widows and our military retirees.\n  There is an unfair and painful offset of the Defense Department's \nSurvivors Benefits Plan, offset against the Veterans Affairs Dependency \nand Indemnity Compensation. What is Survivors Benefit Plan? When \nservicemembers die on active duty, their survivors receive a benefit to \nrecognize their sacrifice. You also have 100-percent disabled military \nretirees who actually go out and purchase this survivors benefit so \ntheir loved ones will have this when they have passed on. Yet that \nsurvivor benefit is today being taken away unfairly from our military \nwidows and orphans. Fixing that is what my amendment is all about.\n  If you go back into the Good Book, you will find that one of the main \nthings that we are admonished is to look out for the widows and \norphans. With our Nation now in a violent struggle with brutal and \nvicious enemies, and Americans being lost every day, we simply must not \nforget that the families left behind by those courageous men and women, \nthose families, bear tremendous pain. Their survivors' lives are \nforever altered. Their future is left unclear. They have made the \nultimate sacrifice and our Nation expects us to honor that sacrifice.\n\n  It reminds me of President Lincoln, who during the midst of the Civil \nWar, said:\n\n       As God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to \n     finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to \n     care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his \n     widow, and his orphan.\n\n  The immortal words of President Lincoln.\n  Since the beginning of this session we have considered and adopted \nincreased death gratuity benefits for the survivors of our troops lost \nin this present war. But the survivors of those killed in action are \nentitled to automatic enrollment in the survivors benefit plan. That is \na change we made in the law, but it is not complete.\n  We now see the pain caused. At the same time a widow or a widower is \nenrolled in the Survivor Benefit Plan, and in many cases paid for it, \nanother set of laws under the Department of Veterans Affairs says they \nare also entitled to dependency and indemnity compensation. However, \nunder current law one offsets the other--they can't get both.\n  Widows instantly recognize the injustice of this offset. It deeply \nwounds their sense of the value of their sacrifice. It is wrong, the \nway we treat these families. This offset is no less painful for the \nsurvivors of our 100-percent disabled military retirees because it is a \npurchased plan, yet they cannot get what they have purchased because it \nis offset by Dependency and Indemnity Compensation.\n  Survivors of service members killed on active duty are entitled, in \nlaw, to automatic enrollment in the Survivor Benefit Plan, and 100-\npercent disabled military retirees can purchase the survivors benefit \nplan. Survivors stand to lose most or even all of the benefits under \nthat plan because they are offset by a second benefit to which they are \nalso entitled, Dependency and Indemnity Compensation.\n  That is not right. I have 22 cosponsors of this amendment. They are \nfrom both sides of the Senate. This amendment is going to remedy these \ninequities. It is going to honor our commitments to military retirees \nand servicemembers who are killed in the line of duty, and their \nsurviving widows and dependent children.\n  We have sergeants and corporals losing their lives. Their base pay \ndetermines the benefits for their surviving spouse. The base pay of a \ncorporal isn't very much, and their survivors are supposed to live off \neven less; yet, in fact, in another part of the law, they are due \nsomething as the widow of a veteran, and we are saying under the \ncurrent law: You cannot get both benefits you are entitled to.\n  Is this what we want to do for these young families who lost a loved \none in Iraq or elsewhere? Will the Nation not stand tall to support \nthem? This is not what the law intended. We ought to change it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor to \nSenator Nelson's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Florida--to make \nsure I understand exactly what he is saying--here is a person in \nservice to our country who was killed in combat. If that soldier had \nbasically bought an insurance policy on his life, then the amount of \nmoney his family would receive from our Government is going to be \nreduced by the amount he would have received from that insurance \npolicy? Is that, in shorthand, the way to describe the current law?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Let me tweak it a little bit for the Senator, \nand I thank the Senator for the compassion coming out of his heart and \nexpressed on his face as he asks this question. This Senator from \nIllinois is right on.\n  In the first place, in current law the soldier does not actually have \nto make an affirmative purchase. Under current law we enroll the \nsurvivors of any service member who is killed in the Survivors Benefit \nPlan. However, for a private, a corporal, a sergeant, that is not a lot \nbecause of their base pay.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I might ask the Senator from Florida, through the Chair, \nso the benefit the soldier receives depends on rank and salary?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Under the Survivors Benefit Plan it does. \nHowever, there is another part of the law that says survivors shall \nreceive a second benefit, Dependency and Indemnity Compensation, to \nattempt in one small way to make those survivors whole for all the \nsacrifice their loved one has given.\n  But, no, because of a problem with the current law, they cannot get \nboth. One offsets the other, the long and short of which is that a \nyoung widow of a private or corporal or sergeant can't make it with \nwhat the U.S. Government is going to give her unless we rectify this \ninequity in the law.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Does the Senator have remaining time?\n\n[[Page S8815]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Florida be \nrecognized for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Florida this specific question. We \nare about to consider whether we are going to shut down debate on this \nbill. It is called cloture. It closes down the debate on the bill, \nlimits the amendments to the bill. As to the Senator's amendment, which \nprotects these widows and surviving children of a soldier killed in \ncombat, once we have closed down debate and limited amendments, would \nwe still be able to vote on the Nelson amendment?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The Senator asked a good question.\n  I ask the Presiding Officer, would the Nelson amendment, with its 22 \ncosponsors, be considered germane following a successful cloture \nmotion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is insufficient information at this \npoint to be able to make that determination.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. So the answer, I say to the Senator from \nIllinois, it could well be knocked off if cloture is brought on this \nDefense authorization bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask through the Chair one last question. How often do \nwe have an opportunity to change the law and to help these soldiers and \ntheir families? How many times do we get a chance in the Senate during \nthe course of the year to consider the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill or another bill that might give us a chance to help \nthose families and to rectify this injustice which the Senator from \nFlorida has pointed out and which I think every Member on both sides of \nthe aisle would like to change?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The Senator from Florida will ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n\n  If the chairman of the committee, the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia, is persuasive in talking to the Republican majority leader \nnot to bring the motion for cloture to cut off debate so that \namendments like this to help widows and orphans might fall, maybe we \ncan get it to a vote. It is the least we can do for Americans who have \ngiven their lives, or their best years, in defense of our country. We \nsimply cannot allow this situation to continue. We need to restore fair \nbenefits to these folks. I am going to continue my fight for these \npeople who have given their all to their Nation and especially to the \nloved ones whom they have left behind.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to our good friend and colleague, we \nwill take under consideration the Senator's amendment with great care.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to address to the chairman \nthe following. I have two pending amendments which I would like to call \nup. I will do this briefly.\n  Mr. WARNER. Please proceed.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1428\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside for the purpose of calling up amendment No. 1428.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1428.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To authorize the Secretary of the Air Force to enter into \n    agreements with St. Clair County, Illinois, for the purpose of \n constructing joint administrative and operations structures at Scott \n                       Air Force Base, Illinois)\n\n       On page 371, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 2887. ADMINISTRATIVE AND OPERATIONS STRUCTURES, SCOTT \n                   AIR FORCE BASE, ILLINOIS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the Secretary of the Air Force may enter into agreements \n     with St. Clair County, Illinois, for the joint construction \n     and use of administrative and operations facilities at Scott \n     Air Force Base, Illinois.\n       (b) Limitations.--\n       (1) Total cost.--The total cost of agreements entered into \n     under subsection (a) may not exceed $60,000,000.\n       (2) Lease payments.--All payments made by the Air Force \n     under leases entered into under subsection (a) shall be made \n     out of funds available for the Air Force for operation and \n     maintenance.\n       (3) Terms of leases.--Any lease agreement entered into \n     under subsection (a)--\n       (A) shall provide for the lease of such administrative or \n     operations facilities for a period not to exceed 30 years; \n     and\n       (B) shall provide that, upon termination of the lease, all \n     right, title, and interest in the facilities shall, at the \n     option of the Secretary, be conveyed to the United States.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, and to the chairman and ranking member of \nthe committee, I hope this is an amendment which will be accepted \nbecause it is noncontroversial and important to my State and to the \nprotection of our country.\n  The amendment authorizes the Secretary of the Air Force to enter into \nagreements with local county officials for the construction and lease \nof joint administration and operation facilities needed at Scott Air \nForce Base, currently operating under a joint use agreement with \nMidAmerica Airport, to accommodate new missions.\n  The fiscal year 05 Defense Appropriations conference report included \n$259 million to procure three C-40C aircraft to be based at Scott Air \nForce Base and flown by the 932nd Airlift Wing with the 375th Air Wing \nas an active associate, move three C-9C aircraft from Andrews Air Force \nBase to Scott AFB, and to support these new and expanded missions.\n  The expanded C-9 mission and new C-40 mission will strain existing \nTRANSCOM and TACC facilities and require additional administrative and \noperations space/structures.\n  Due to the accelerated funding schedule of the C-9 and C-40 missions, \nimmediate administrative and operations space is needed.\n  St. Clair County, IL, the appropriate local unit of Government, has \noffered to enter into an agreement with the Air Force to construct the \nnecessary facilities, saving our Department of Defense some money. \nThese structures would be for joint military-civilian use. Currently, \nScott AFB and MidAmerica Airport operate on a joint use plan. St. Clair \nCounty is a partner in MidAmerica Airport.\n  The Air Force has estimated the cost of a new facility for TRANSCOM \nand HQ TACC is about $60 million.\n  This general provision is needed in order for the Air Force and St. \nClair County to enter into an agreement on joint use facilities. The \nconstruction would be at no cost to the Air Force. The county would \ninvite the Air Force to lease space in the buildings, consistent with \nmilitary lease requirements.\n  If the chairman has not had a chance to review this amendment, I \nwould like to ask his staff to take a look at it. It is no expense to \nthe Government and it provides a necessary facility at a very important \nairbase.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we will take the amendment under careful \nconsideration, I assure the Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask for the yeas and nays on that pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1571\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask that amendment be set aside and we \ncall up amendment No. 1571.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for himself, Ms. \n     Mikulski, Mr. Allen, Mr. Graham, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n     Sarbanes, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n     Salazar, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Chafee, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Biden, \n     Mr. Kennedy, and Mrs. Murray, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1571.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment is not new to this Senate. \nWe have considered it several times and passed it. It has not survived \nconference committees, but I hope this time it will be successful, we \nwill be successful in our effort in passing it. It is the reservist pay \namendment.\n  Here is what is going on in America: All across America members of \nGuard units and Reserve units are being activated, called into service \nfor our country, risking their lives, spending lengthy periods of time \naway from their families. We understand these new assignments create a \nlot of personal hardship and sacrifice on the part of these soldiers \nand marines, sailors, airmen, members of the Coast Guard, and others. \nWe also understand it creates much financial hardship on some as well.\n  So we, as a nation, encourage the employers of Guard and Reserve \nmembers to try to stand by the men and women who are serving our \ncountry, even when they have been activated. It turns out that well \nover 1,000 employers across America have said: We will do just that. \nThey continue to make up the difference in pay for these activated \nmembers of the Guard and Reserve. We salute them. We thank them. They \nare bringing financial peace of mind to men and women who are serving \nour country every day, separated from their homes and their families.\n  Now, the concern I have is the fact that one of the largest employers \nin America is not doing the same thing, and that is the Federal \nGovernment. The Federal Government is not making up the difference in \npay for those members of the Guard and Reserve who are activated. Some \nof them face quite a setback when they are activated and receive less \nmoney and a lot of financial hardship.\n  Last year, when we debated this amendment, the Government \nAccountability Office told us that about 40 percent of Guardsmen and \nReservists lose some amount of income when mobilized. Well, I want to \nreport to the Senate that figure has now been updated. The new figure \nis 51 percent. More than half of the men and women activated in the \nGuard and Reserve lose income because of that activation, causing \nfinancial hardship and economic difficulties for some. Over 11 percent \nof those activated lose more than $2,500.\n  We also find that income loss is one of the top reasons given by \nGuardsmen and Reservists as to why they stop serving in Reserve \ncomponents. We need to actively recruit and retain the very best to \nserve in America's military. And when you ask those currently serving \nwhy they are not reupping, why they are not reenlisting, many of them \ngive as a major reason--one of the top reasons--the loss of income when \nthey are activated to serve from Reserve units.\n  We want to make certain that we salute the employers across America \nwho are dealing with these troops and helping them. But I think we have \nan obligation, those of us who work here in Washington, to make sure \nour Government does the same.\n  Roughly 1 out of every 10 Guardsmen and Reservists in service to our \ncountry is also a Federal employee. How can we on the one hand say to \nprivate employers, and even State governments, ``We salute you for your \nforesight and compassion in helping our troops'' and not do the same? I \nthink we ought to be standing by those Federal employees who are \nactivated in the service to our country as well. We should not be \nlagging behind those who have made real contributions and have shown \nthis leadership. We should be setting an example.\n  This measure does not bust the budget. It results in some \nexpenditures, but the money to make up any lost income by mobilized \nFederal workers is drawn from funds already previously appropriated. \nSecondly, it is not additional pay for military service. Reservists \ncontinue to receive the same military pay for the same military job. \nAny differential pay they receive is separate and apart, simply \nintended to keep such employees financially whole while serving our \ncountry.\n  I do not believe our service men and women sit down and ask those \nserving with them, ``Do you have a supplement in pay coming in here?'' \nand resent it if some do and some do not. Why, then, would we put \nFederal employees in this unfortunate situation? The wisdom of this \namendment is it is readily understandable by the entire force, whether\n\n[[Page S8817]]\n\nActive Duty or Reserve. They know that private-sector companies are \nmaking whole these employees' pay, and they can certainly understand it \nif the Federal Government did the same.\n  I think we ought to be sensitive to the fact that if we do not make \nup the difference in regular civilian income, it could create great \nhardship, concern, worry, stress, and anxiety on troops that we want in \nthe field with a positive attitude doing their job and coming home \nsafely.\n  The reason to support this measure is simple: The Federal Government \ncannot continue to do less for its employees than other major \nemployers. It is time for the Government to be as generous, as caring, \nas compassionate as Sears, Roebuck, IBM, Home Depot, General Motors, \nand 24 State governments that stand behind their soldiers once they are \nactivated to serve our country.\n  How can we commend everyone else and not do our part? We can adopt \nthis amendment. I invite all of my colleagues to come together once \nmore to adopt the Reservist Pay Security Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1496\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1496.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1496.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for normalizing relations with \n Libya pending resolution with Libya of certain claims relating to the \n         bombing of the LaBelle Discotheque in Berlin, Germany)\n\n       At the end of title XII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1205. LIMITATION ON AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS FOR \n                   NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS WITH GOVERNMENT OF \n                   LIBYA.\n\n       None of the funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act \n     or any other Act may be obligated or expended for purposes of \n     negotiations towards normalizing relations with the \n     Government of Libya until the Attorney General, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of \n     Defense, certifies to Congress that the Government of Libya \n     has made a good faith offer in the negotiations on the claims \n     of members of the Armed Forces of the United States who were \n     injured in the bombing of the LaBelle Discotheque in Berlin, \n     Germany, and the claims of family members of members of the \n     Armed Forces of the United States who were killed in that \n     bombing.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on April 5, 1986, Libya directed its agents \nto execute a terrorist attack in West Berlin for the sole purpose of \nkilling and maiming as many American military personnel as possible. So \nthey selected a discotheque that military personnel frequented in \nBerlin. They placed a bomb in the discotheque when 260 people, \nincluding U.S. personnel, were present. When that bomb detonated, two \nU.S. soldiers were killed and over 90 soldiers were severely injured. \nThey have not been compensated.\n  The German civilians who were in that discotheque were compensated, \nbut the American military personnel and their families have not been, \ndespite promises of the Libyan Government to do so.\n  So this amendment simply says that we will not normalize, in any \nfurther way, relations with Libya until the Attorney General, after \nconsulting with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense, \ncertifies to Congress that Libya has made a good-faith effort and a \ngood-faith offer in negotiating with U.S. service members who were \ninjured in that discotheque bombing and with the family members of U.S. \nservice members who were killed in that bombing.\n  It is a very straightforward amendment that is so essential if we are \ngoing to do justice for U.S. military personnel who were killed in a \nterrorist attack by Libya the way justice has been done for the German \ncivilians who were killed in that attack at that discotheque that was \nperpetrated by Libya and its agents.\n  So we provide a very carefully worded assessment by the Secretary of \nState and the Attorney General. They will decide if the good-faith \noffer has been made the way it has been promised. We do not make that \ndecision in this amendment. We leave that up to the Attorney General, \nafter consulting with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of \nDefense.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1497\n\n  Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment \nbe laid aside, and I call up amendment No. 1497.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1497.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To establish limitations on excess charges under time-and-\n   materials contracts and labor-hour contracts of the Department of \n                                Defense)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title VIII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 807. LIMITATION ON EXCESS CHARGES UNDER TIME-AND-\n                   MATERIALS AND LABOR-HOUR CONTRACTS.\n\n       (a) Regulations Required.--Not later than 90 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense \n     shall prescribe regulations governing the terms and \n     conditions of time-and-materials contracts and labor-hour \n     contracts entered into for or on behalf of the Department of \n     Defense.\n       (b) Limitation on Excess Charges.--\n       (1) In general.--The regulations prescribed pursuant to \n     subsection (a) shall authorize the use of a time-and-\n     materials contract or a labor-hour contract for or on behalf \n     of the Department of Defense only if the contract provides \n     for acquiring supplies or services on the basis of--\n       (A) direct labor hours provided by the prime contractor at \n     specified fixed hourly rates that include wages, overhead, \n     general and administrative expenses, and profit; and\n       (B) the reimbursement of the prime contractor for the \n     reasonable costs (including overhead, general and \n     administrative expenses, and profit, to the extent permitted \n     under the regulations) of subcontracts for supplies and \n     subcontracts for services, except as provided in paragraph \n     (2).\n       (2) Subcontractor labor hours.--Direct labor hours provided \n     by a subcontractor may be provided on the basis of specified \n     fixed hourly rates that include wages, overhead, general and \n     administrative expenses, and profit only if such hourly rates \n     are set forth in the contract for that specific \n     subcontractor.\n       (c) Department of Defense Purchases Through Contracts \n     Entered by Non-defense Agencies.--The regulations prescribed \n     pursuant to subsection (a) shall include appropriate measures \n     to ensure compliance with the requirements of this section in \n     all Department of Defense purchases through non-defense \n     agencies.\n       (d) Effective Date.--The regulations prescribed pursuant to \n     subsection (a) shall take effect on the date that is 90 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act, and shall apply \n     to--\n       (1) all contracts awarded for or on behalf of the \n     Department of Defense on or after such date; and\n       (2) all task or delivery orders issued for or on behalf of \n     the Department of Defense on or after such date, regardless \n     whether the contracts under which such task or delivery \n     orders are issued were awarded before, on, or after such \n     date.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we read the other day in the Washington \nPost about a procedure that is used by a number of contractors that \nreimburses those contractors for services rendered by subcontractors \nand where the contractor is charging the Government significantly more \nfor that service than the subcontractor is paid. We are talking about \nlabor rates.\n  Here is what the Post told us and reminded us:\n\n       Security guards in Virgin Islands paid $15 and $20 an hour \n     were billed to the government at [twice that rate]. Office \n     workers provided by [a subcontractor] at $20 an hour were \n     billed to the government [by the prime contractor] at $48.07 \n     an hour.\n\n  This is not just to have a profit put in there for the prime \ncontractor. That\n\n[[Page S8818]]\n\nis legitimate. This is a theory that prime contractors are using known \nas ``mapping,'' where instead of basing their charge to the Government \non the cost of labor, they are basing the charge to the Government on a \ntheoretical cost of labor--not on the subcontractor's cost but on what \nthe prime would have paid for the same service. So we are billed as a \nGovernment for labor performed, and the cost of that labor, although it \nis not the true cost of the labor, is a theoretical cost.\n  That kind of practice should end. This amendment would fix the \nproblem by requiring that prime contractors charge the Government their \nactual subcontract costs, unless the subcontract rates are specifically \nset forth in the prime contract. The General Services Administration \nhas been balking at this change, although the Department of Defense \nitself says they have recognized the problem and are working to fix it. \nSo we are going to come down with the effort to correct this problem \nthat the DOD recognizes and override the obstinacy of the GSA to \ncorrect a very obvious inequity in terms of the American taxpayer.\n  So that is the sum and substance of this amendment. We would ask that \nthis amendment be considered in the usual course, assuming, again, that \ncloture is not invoked.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, we are a nation at war. I can think of no \nother legislation deserving of this body's complete attention than the \nDefense Authorization bill. What could be more profound than debating \ncritically important amendments on the very issues of war and peace? \nWhat could honor our men and women in uniform fighting in the sands of \nIraq and Afghanistan than a full and complete discussion of amendments \nthat will promote the safety and well-being of our troops, their \nfamilies, our veterans, and our national security. Unfortunately, there \nare those who wish to shut down this critically important debate. And \nso I rise today to urge my colleagues to consider the consequences of \nterminating such discourse. When the time comes tomorrow, I ask my \ncolleagues to vote against cloture to end debate on this important \npiece of legislation.\n  I am not a member of this committee. And I commend the distinguished \nchairman from Virginia and the ranking member from Michigan and the \nother members of this committee who have worked tirelessly to bring \nthis bill to the floor.\n  In my more than 20 years as a Member of this body, I can tell you, \nhistorically, the Defense authorization bill has come up at about this \ntime, and has generally been subject to between five and ten days of \nunlimited debate over its amendments. From the time that John Stennis \nwas the chairman of the Armed Services Committee to the tenure of its \ncurrent Chairman, Senator Warner, I have observed the great care that \nthis body has taken to ensure adequate consideration of amendments that \nwould serve the national security interests of our nation. And we in \nthis body have done so because of the importance of this legislation--\nparticularly at times, such as now, when the Nation faced down grave \nthreats around the globe.\n  As a matter of tradition as well as law, the Armed Services Committee \nhas always produced an authorization bill. Unlike any other government \nagencies, the Defense Department has always been subject to both an \nauthorization and appropriations bill.\n  Other than some expenditures that occur as a result of our demands \nunder Medicaid, Medicare, and the like, nothing consumes as much of our \nTreasury as does the Defense appropriations bill. Therefore, Mr. \nPresident, I rise because of my concern that we are about to vote \ntomorrow after little more than a day and a half of debate on this \nDefense authorization bill. Here we are bringing up one of the most \ncritically important pieces of legislation we ever consider here, and \nwe are going to potentially truncate this debate down to a few hours.\n  Here we are, a nation at war, with literally thousands of our fellow \ncitizens in uniform serving in Afghanistan and Iraq. We are facing \nmajor questions about the conduct of a war and considerable strain is \nbeing placed on our military personnel--with active duty, reserve, and \nnational guard members. Are constituents are asking How well protected \nare our troops? How much do we provide for them when they come back?\n  We have listened to my colleague from Florida, my colleague from \nIllinois, and my colleague from Michigan, who raise serious issues \nabout whether we are going to provide additional benefits for our \nveterans. I am told by many who have analyzed these amendments that \nthere is a very good likelihood that those amendments would not survive \na post-cloture environment. If we do invoke cloture tomorrow, at 10 or \n10:30 tomorrow morning, I am told that those amendments would require a \nsupermajority to consider them, and there is little or no likelihood \nthey would ever have any chance of being even considered by this body.\n  I do not understand that. I do not quite understand the logic that \nwould suggest somehow we ought to so truncate this debate that these \nvery important amendments would not be considered or at least \npotentially not be considered. There are a number of amendments being \noffered on the Base Realignment and Closure Commission that has been \nformed.\n  I know the Presiding Officer, like this Senator, has more than a \npassing interest in what happens with the Base Closure commission. \nFacilities in both of our States are listed for closure. There are \nthose of us who have deep concerns about how this process is working. \nIf, in fact, cloture is invoked tomorrow, I suspect, based on what I \nhave been told, that any effort by the Presiding Officer or this \nSenator or others to bring up these amendments, to talk about those \nissues, to at least debate them here and ask our colleagues whether \nthey are sympathetic to our proposals would fail. We would not be \nallowed to consider those amendments.\n\n  Again, I am not suggesting that every idea we have ought to be \nadopted by this body. But the fact that we wouldn't even be allowed to \ndebate these matters strikes me as a breach of our obligations to our \nconstituents back home as well as American troops fighting on the \nfrontlines in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I realize you have to close the debate at some point. You can't go on \nendlessly. We are getting near the end of this session before we take \nthe August break. So clearly over the next several days, we have to \nconclude these debates. But there ought to be ample enough time, short \nof 10:30 tomorrow morning, for us to conclude our deliberations, going \nthrough amendments, dropping those which may be redundant. At least \nthere ought to be a fair consideration of those matters before we just \ncut off the debate, slam the door shut on matters as important as the \nsafety and well-being of our troops, American veterans, the BRAC \nprocess, the future of new nuclear weapons programs and a whole host of \nissues that would no longer be viable under a postcloture environment.\n  For example, Senator Stabenow would like to offer a critically \nimportant amendment to guarantee adequate funding levels for veterans \nhealth benefits; Senator Murray would like to offer an amendment on \nchildcare for troops based overseas; Senator Kerry has an amendment on \nthe GI bill. And Senators McCain and Graham have a number of issues \nrelated to the treatment of detainees held in U.S. military facilities.\n  For those who care about BRAC amendments, those who care about the \nGeneva Convention, those who care about whether we can have a good \ndebate regarding our veterans, the base-closing commission, all of that \ndiscussion would be precluded from having a final consideration if, in \nfact, cloture is to be invoked.\n  The Presiding Officer, when queried whether these amendments would \nfall, properly responded that you would have to see the amendment \nbefore you could make a categorical statement. But for those who have \nbeen through these amendments and examined whether they would survive \npostcloture, the conclusion has been that this list of amendments, \nincluding many more that I have in front of me, would not survive a \npostcloture environment.\n  I urge my colleagues, regardless of how you may feel about these \namendments, give this body a chance to do its\n\n[[Page S8819]]\n\njob. Otherwise, by closing off the debate, we deprive our members and \nthe American people of critically important discourse at a time when \nour nation is at war.\n  Throughout my tenure here, I do not ever recall a debate that would \nlast about a day and a half on a Defense authorization bill, \nparticularly when our troops were engaged in combat overseas. Some of \nthe best debates I have ever witnessed as a Member of this body have \noccurred on the Defense authorization bill because the chairs of this \ncommittee, Republicans and Democrats, have insisted that authorization \nbill be considered by this body in its entirety. We made better \ndecisions because we had those debates about the direction in which our \ncountry ought to go.\n  Arguing over the wisdom of certain weapons systems, arguing over \nwhether we ought to be involved in certain military conflicts, it has \nbeen educational for the country.\n  And in the end, no other issue was more important than those \nimpacting our troops deployed in harm's way. We have lost somewhere \nbetween 1,700 and 2,000 of our men and women in uniform, battling in \nIraq and Afghanistan. It is for them and their families that we ought \nto continue to take into serious consideration the various amendments \nproposed to support their operations at home and abroad.\n  What matter could possibly trump the importance of having a full \ndebate about the national security needs of our country? I can't think \nof another subject matter that is more important than this one. \nAllowing this body to be heard on these issues is the patriotic thing \nto do. It would be unpatriotic to cut off debate prematurely. There \nshould be a time certain on final passage and not to delay going on \nendlessly in this discussion. But these are important amendments my \ncolleagues have drafted.\n  I have no amendment on this list. I am a cosponsor of a couple of \nthem. But I have no matter that I am insisting be brought up here. But \nthere are others here who do have amendments that ought to be heard. \nBut I would hope that the leadership would ask to vitiate the cloture \nvote, work out the arrangements we traditionally do here so that \namendments could be brought up and debated and discussed in a \nreasonable amount of time, and try to limit the number of amendments so \nwe don't have duplication.\n  I hope this evening as the leadership considers its game plan for \ntomorrow and the coming days, they will decide that the Defense \nauthorization bill ought to be the business of the day, of every day \nthis week to finish this debate and to do so in the kind of spirit that \nI think is warranted, when Members of both bodies get a chance to fully \ndebate and discuss the importance of these issues.\n  We ought to have a debate about the Base Closure Commission. There \nare important issues. Is it wise for us to be shutting down major \nmilitary facilities at a time of war? Would it not be wiser maybe to \ndelay those decisions a few months to determine whether we truly are \ngoing to need these facilities in the coming months? That is a \nlegitimate debate to occur. When else is it going to occur if not on \nthis bill? When can it come up? After September 8, when the decisions \nare made, when we are already just coming back from an August break and \npeople look back and say, Why didn't you raise it then, why didn't you \ndebate it on the floor of Senate to let the American public know what \nthe choices ought to be?\n  If we cut off this debate, I am told that those amendments that would \ndeal with the Base Closure Commission would not be allowed under a \npostcloture environment.\n  I think that is an important debate. Our colleagues may decide to \nvote against those amendments, may decide they are all wrong, but at \nleast give us a chance to be heard and to vote up or down on whether \nyou think it is the right time to close these facilities.\n  Certainly, when it comes to veterans' benefits and some of the other \nissues that my colleagues are offering--Senator Dorgan from North \nDakota wants to form a special committee dealing with contracting. Lord \nknows, given the amount of waste and abuse that there have been reports \nof that have occurred, that certainly is a good amendment, in my view. \nI think we probably ought to have such a committee to determine whether \ntaxpayer money is being wasted. That amendment, I am told, would fall.\n  Senator Kennedy and Senator Feinstein want to offer an amendment on \ndealing with the robust nuclear earth penetrator. We have had a good \ndebate here. I listened intently to both sides as they argued the \nwisdom of having that system or not. I am told that amendment would \nfall as well. That is an important debate to have, regardless of your \nview. We ought to be debating the wisdom of that weapons system. If \nthat debate does not occur here, where does it occur, if not on the \nDefense authorization bill? Is it unpatriotic to have a debate about a \nweapons system that will cost millions and millions of dollars when \nthere are strong feelings on both sides? If we cut off that debate, we \nwill never have an opportunity to understand the wisdom of having a \nsystem or not having that system.\n  It is not my intention to go down and list every single one of these \namendments that I am told would fall. My colleague from Connecticut, \nwould like to propose an amendment increasing Army end strength, he is \noffering that amendment with several of our colleagues. That is a very \nimportant amendment. That is a very important debate, for it gets to \nthe core of the readiness of the American Armed Forces. What is the \nappropriate personnel level for our forces to both fight wars on two \nfronts while staying prepared to mobilize against threats that have not \nyet emerged? If you don't have that debate on this bill, when do you \nhave it? If you don't authorize it, you can't appropriate it. If you \ncan't appropriate it, then we never can decide whether that end \nstrength ought to be increased. Again, there may be those who will \noffer very strong arguments against the Lieberman amendment about why \nwe don't need to increase the end strength, but let's have the debate \nand let's have the vote, if you think it is important. I believe it is.\n  I feel strongly about this and many other issues. Some have suggested \nthat there will be those who will be accused of being not patriotic if \nthey appear to be having an extended debate on the Defense \nauthorization bill. I think just the opposite. It is unpatriotic not to \nhave the debate. Not unlimited debate, not debate that goes on forever, \nbut is it unlimited debated to go on for the next 2 or 3 days to \ndiscuss this issue which is in the headlines every day we pick up the \npaper? Terrorists attacking the transit system in London, hotels in \nEgypt. We find soldiers dying from suicide bombers every day. What \ncould be more important than this subject matter, to be discussing how \nbest to prepare our troops and our country for what needs to be done to \nsupport our veterans when they come back from these conflicts?\n  It is unpatriotic to cut off the debate. The patriotic thing to do is \nto have a good discussion, a good civil debate over the important \nissues that confront our country when it comes to the Defense \nauthorization. I commend the chairman of the committee for insisting \nthat there be a debate on the Defense authorization bill. That is the \ngreat tradition of this committee. It is one of the few committees that \nis an authorizing committee that insists every year that there be a \nDefense authorization bill. I commend every member of that committee \nfor insisting that we take the time to do it. I wish other authorizing \ncommittees were insistent as well so that we would have these debates \nabout policy before deciding on the appropriations levels. That is the \nway it ought to proceed. My commendations to Senators Warner and Levin \nand other members of the committee. I thank them for giving us the \nopportunity to at least discuss these matters tonight.\n  Every year we have had a good debate on Defense authorization. Armed \nServices is one of the few committees that insist upon it. I wish \nothers did as well. It is the way we are supposed to proceed.\n  It is the tradition of this great body to have good discussions, \neducate our constituents about the difficult choices with not unlimited \nresources. Where do we go? What do we invest in? How far do we go in \nhelping veterans and in the support structures we need? That debate \noccurs because there has been a\n\n[[Page S8820]]\n\ntradition in the committee of insisting that we have that discussion. I \nhope, as I said in the absence of the chairman, we have a reasonable \namount of time this week--call for a time certain on Thursday or \nFriday, whenever it would occur, to end debate and come to final \npassage.\n  Why don't we stay in tomorrow night and Wednesday night later than we \nnormally retire here, and we can come in a bit earlier. Say you have an \nhour or half an hour for debate on amendment. Let's have that good \ndiscussion.\n  The country would be better for it, and our men and women in uniform \ndeserve it. They want to know where we are and where we are going. \nThere is no vehicle other than the Defense authorization bill for us to \nhave that kind of discussion and to consider these important \namendments. It has been the history of this great body, and I hope it \nwill continue to be after tomorrow. And I would suggest, that at a time \nwhen this Nation is engaged in a war on terrorism, it is important that \nwe take as much care as possible to consider these critically important \nmatters.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may I assure our colleague and others who \nhave expressed an interest, Senator Levin and I are working toward \nthose ends. I take full responsibility for the concept of the cloture. \nIt has achieved, a significant result thus far. We have up to 240 \namendments. Another 18 amendments are pending at the desk with \nrollcalls requested. So the Senate is actively participating. I assure \nyou I am going to meet with my leader--and I respect his judgment--\nfirst thing in the morning. I will explore the options that are \navailable with him. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. While Senators Dodd and Warner are on the floor, let me \nfirst thank Senator Dodd for the passion he brought to this issue. This \nsounds like a process issue. It is not a process issue. These are life-\nand-death issues we are debating. These are war issues and how do we \nsupport our troops and their families issues. These are issues of \nwhether there will be benefits for families who have lost loved ones in \nwar. These are issues of whether bases will be closed, issues of \nnuclear weapons, and issues of whether we are going to go down the road \nof new nuclear weapons use at the same time we are trying to persuade \nthe world not to go down that road.\n  These are the most vital issues we can possibly face as a people. I \ncommend the chairman. He is, in good faith, going to attempt to see if \nwe cannot find a way we can have a reasonable few days of debate before \nthis debate is closed off, so we can consider the important amendments \nthat have been filed.\n  The chairman is very much aware of the tradition of this committee \nbecause he has been part of it and supportive of it for so long. The \ntradition the Senator from Connecticut talks about is tradition which \nis plenty deep, but it is also law. I think we are the only committee \nwhich, by law, must pass an authorization bill. So that tradition is \nembodied in the law itself.\n  There is one little statistic, and this is something the Senator from \nConnecticut feels in his bones is true. But I want to give a statistic \nto support that passion and feeling that has been so beautifully \nexpressed by the Senator from Connecticut. Last year, the first cloture \nmotion was filed on the 11th day of debate. This year, it was the \nbeginning of the second day. The second cloture motion, because the \nfirst wasn't adopted last year, was filed after 15 days of debate and \nafter 148 amendments were considered. That is how important this bill \nis. So look at a longer period of time--a 10-year average. The average \nlength of time for the first filing of cloture on a Defense \nauthorization bill during that 10-year period is the fifth day of \ndebate, and the second filing is on the ninth day of debate. So we have \nalways historically, and by law, taken a reasonable period of time--a \nweek or 2 weeks--to debate this bill because of its importance to the \ncountry.\n  As I was saying a moment ago, the chairman is very much aware of this \ntradition. He embodies it. He has fought for it. The Defense \nauthorization bill should have due consideration, and I know he will do \nwhat he can in the next 24 hours to see if we cannot work out something \nthat would allow some critically important amendments to be considered.\n  I thank the chairman for that and I thank the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we have labored together these 27 years. \nThis, too, shall be overcome in one way or another. I thank my friend \nfrom Connecticut. I am impressed with the enthusiasm he expressed at \nthis hour of the night.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my friend. Enthusiasm at any hour of the night is \nappreciated.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to express concerns about the Levin \namendment related to Federal time and material contracts.\n  The proposed amendment would direct that when prime contractor \nengages a subcontractor to augment the delivery of hours under a time \nand materials contract, the prime should be entitled to be reimbursed \nonly at the price the subcontractor is billing the prime.\n  I want to bring to the attention of the Senate the rational for the \npricing of these time and materials contracts. The prime contractor \nmust locate, negotiate and obtain the subcontractors with whom he \nperforms the contract and assume the risk associated with his and the \nsubcontractors performance. If a subcontractor does not perform or is \nsubstandard in its performance, the prime is responsible. If a \nsubcontractor quits or is dismissed, the prime must find a substitute. \nAssuming this management role, and more importantly, the risk, is one \nof the reasons for the time and management contract and the blended \npayment arrangement.\n  Of particular concern to me about the Levin amendment is its \npotential impact on small business. The proposed amendment would be \ncounter to the President's mandate to promote small business \nparticipation in government acquisitions by de-incentivizing prime \ncontractors from engaging subcontractors--most of whom are small \nbusinesses--in the fulfillment of their contracts.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I am told that the administration is about to \ninitiate a rule making to revise how time and materials contracts are \nmanaged. Federal contracting is a very complex process which is best \nresolved through a thorough review among all the parties and through \nthe regulatory process. If there are abuses, I am the first to stand \nand say that they should be stopped. But it is very difficult for the \nSenate today to understand fully the implications of the Levin \namendment and whether it will even resolve any alleged abuses in \ncontracting.\n  I would like to work with Senator Levin and others to encourage the \nadministration to issue its proposed rule promptly, put it out for \ncomment so that all the impacted parties would have the opportunity to \ncomment. If the Senate continues to have concerns once the rule making \nis completed, that is the appropriate time for us to act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that several letters I received on this \nsubject be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                Professional Services Council,\n\n                                                    July 25, 2005.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As the Senate continues with its debate \n     on S. 1042, the fiscal year 2006 National Defense \n     Authorization Act, we understand that Senator Levin may offer \n     an amendment to dictate the method for pricing time and \n     materials and labor-hour (T) contracts and subcontracts on \n     Defense Department contracts and purchases through non-\n     defense agencies. On behalf of the Professional Services \n     Council (PSC), I am writing to urge you to oppose the \n     amendment in its current form.\n       PSC is the leading national trade association that \n     represents more than 185 companies of all business sizes \n     providing professional and technical services to virtually \n     every agency of the federal government, including information \n     technology, engineering, logistics, operations and \n     maintenance, consulting, international development, \n     scientific environmental and social sciences.\n       We strongly disagree with the characterization contained in \n     the amendment's title that it is necessary to limit ``excess\n\n[[Page S8821]]\n\n     charges.'' Nothing in the DCAA work or in the contract \n     negotiation process supports the allegation that there are \n     ``excess charges'' on these T contracts. Furthermore, if \n     the Levin amendment was adopted, we believe it would \n     significantly restrict defense agencies' flexibilities to \n     select the best contract type to meet its mission needs. The \n     amendment will also directly affect prime contractor-\n     subcontractor relationships, particularly where the agency's \n     procurement needs are addressed through a task order under an \n     existing multiple-award contract or through purchases from \n     the GSA schedules. It could also particularly affect small \n     business subcontractors and the ability of prime contractors \n     to manage those subcontracts, as well as a contractor's \n     ability to meet existing small business subcontracting \n     requirements.\n       Finally, because the amendment applies to new task orders \n     under already awarded contracts, all of the government's \n     approved pricing agreements would have to be renegotiated to \n     adopt the regulatory changes that would flow from the \n     legislative prescription. This is a significant \n     administrative task for the department and would \n     significantly slow up new work under these task orders until \n     these actions can be completed.\n       Over a year ago, the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) \n     identified a potential ambiguity between provisions in the \n     Federal Acquisition Regulation and the terms and conditions \n     of T type contracts, particularly under the GSA Schedules \n     program. Since then, both DCAA and GSA have been meeting to \n     resolve the matter. This discussion should be allowed to \n     continue to timely resolution. In addition, the Federal \n     Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Council is reviewing proposed \n     clarifications to the FAR and that process would, importantly \n     and appropriately, provide an opportunity for public comment \n     on any changes. We strongly encourage the Senate to not \n     preclude the regulatory process from considering the full \n     implications of this important contracting matter.\n       We appreciate the importance of transparency in the \n     contracting process and believe it can be accomplished \n     through appropriate administrative policies and contract \n     negotiations.

No prime will accept the work of \n     subcontractors if they cannot properly price risk and yet \n     still be held accountable for total performance. The losers \n     will probably be the small- to mid-size businesses that are \n     now flourishing, since the integrators will do the work \n     themselves at possibly higher rates. The government will have \n     to take on the additional role of the systems integrator and \n     then contract separately with these smaller firms.\n       While the Levin amendment allows initial subcontractor \n     rates to be included with some overhead and profit \n     considerations, additional future subcontractors could only \n     be added at their labor rates, thus not allowing the prime to \n     price for risk and overhead. The prime contractors, however, \n     would still be held responsible for their performance. Since \n     many of these contracts run 3 to 5 years or more, this would \n     be very disruptive for federal contractors. Also, the \n     amendment seems to go into effect immediately, so that \n     contracts already in place could be affected. The IT industry \n     is very dynamic with new businesses entering the market. The \n     Levin Amendment would freeze the contract to the original \n     participants and take away the flexibility of adding new \n     technology to government contracts.\n       To summarize the situation, the prime contractor serves the \n     same role as the general contractor when building a new \n     house. It is the company's role to guarantee that a total \n     solution is provided by managing the subcontractors, \n     overseeing the delivery of supplies, and thus presenting the \n     homeowner with a completed building. This amendment singles \n     out future subcontractors and applies different pricing rules \n     to them while still holding the prime contractor responsible \n     for the total project.\n       We urge your opposition to the Levin Amendment.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                 Harris N. Miller,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           Comments on Time and Materials Contract Amendment\n\n\n                    risk and small business impacts\n\n       This is a problem more for the small to medium size service \n     firms that have to use significant subcontract labor to \n     obtain the appropriate expertise. Larger firms will opt to \n     self-perform rather than subcontract for labor, which will \n     serve to reduce subcontract opportunities. In the final \n     analysis, it is the SB/SDB that will be impacted.\n       The proposed amendment would not allow prime contractor \n     risk to be added to the subcontractor rate. This likely will \n     militate against using T subcontracts in favor of cost type \n     contracts. This may be a problem for subcontractors that do \n     not have CAS compliant systems that would be required under \n     cost reimbursable contracts. This would probably impact \n     commercial sources and small businesses the most.\n\n\n                         administrative burden\n\n       Most large services contracts over the last few years have \n     included large teams of subcontractors (20 + companies). \n     There will be a large administrative burden to the Government \n     (and the contractor) if each subcontractor labor category \n     must be billed out at a separate rate. This will require \n     extensive invoice reconciliation. Also, as subcontractors are \n     added to the team over time for specific requirements a new \n     set of rates will be required to be negotiated and added to \n     the contract. Since the Government is likely to be reluctant \n     to negotiate and administer multiple sets of rates, primes \n     will retain more work in house and small business \n     participation will be reduced.\n       The use of a single rate per category, eases \n     administration, increases contractor risk and opportunity, \n     and provides labor at commercially competitive rates. If the \n     Government truly believes that the use of subcontractor \n     specific rates is necessary, the solution is already \n     available through the use of a cost type contract.\n       If enacted, this amendment would slow proposal preparation \n     and submission to a crawl, as no competent prime contractor \n     will conclude a T contract containing subcontractor costs \n     until the subcontractor is selected and costs are fully-\n     priced.\n       The amendment would limit contractor flexibility to cope \n     promptly with changed circumstances without processing a \n     contract modification. Changed circumstances include \n     unanticipated surges in requirements to react to an emergent \n     situation necessitating the hiring of subcontract personnel, \n     the need to substitute for a poor performing subcontractor \n     listed in the contract, and the need to add a subcontractor \n     to meet small business goals.\n       The legislation is silent on how a contractor would be \n     reimbursed if it reacted to an emergent situation by using \n     subcontracted effort, to the benefit of the Government, when \n     the subcontractor's rates are not listed in the contract. \n     Some labor hour contracts extend over multiple years and have \n     goals for the utilization of small and small disadvantaged \n     businesses, all of which may not be known at the time of \n     contract award.\n       This requirement would inhibit changing from one \n     subcontractor to another subcontractor for underperformance. \n     The contractor would potentially have to propose the new \n     subcontractor to the contracting officer and have the \n     appropriate rate included in the contract before the change \n     could be made. This would be particularly problematic for \n     contractors working in a deployed situation where completion/\n     delivery may directly impact mission success and the safety/\n     welfare of military personnel.\n\n\n                     impact on commercial practices\n\n       The proposed legislation fails to exclude ``commercial'' \n     T purchases. Commercial pricing is not cost-based but is \n     market driven. The legislation would require that certain \n     elements of cost plus profit be included in the specified \n     rates. Commercial contractors will be reluctant or refuse not \n     propose elements of cost which would seem to be required by \n     the proposed legislation.\n       This revision would preclude the use of commercial T \n     contracts which was specifically authorized by legislation \n     just last year.\n\n\n                             other concerns\n\n       Section (d)(2), which applies the requirement retroactively \n     to task or delivery orders under existing contracts, may be \n     unconstitutional under Winstar. (Supreme Court case that \n     ruled that Congress cannot change laws that will affect \n     contracts retroactively.)\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1425\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Healy\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to remember and honor Senior \nChief Petty Officer Daniel Healy of Exeter, NH for his service and \nsupreme sacrifice for his country.\n  Daniel exhibited a willingness and enthusiasm to serve and defend his \ncountry by joining the United States Navy. He was dedicated to a cause \nmuch greater than himself, demonstrated by his decision to join the \nU.S. Navy SEALs, one of the most challenging, rigorous, and elite \nfighting organizations in the history of the world. Navy SEALs are \nnamed after the environment in which they operate, the Sea, Air, and \nLand, and are the foundation of Naval Special Warfare combat forces. \nThey are organized, trained and equipped to conduct a variety of \nSpecial Operations missions in all operational environments. SEAL \ntraining is extremely demanding, both mentally and physically, and \nproduces the world's best maritime warriors that live by the motto of \n``the only easy day was yesterday.'' Daniel knew that he would be \ncontinually challenged and surely would face dangerous assignments when \nhe signed up for this premier fighting organization. He was a stellar \nexample of today's elite warriors that are upholding the values of \nfreedom and democracy around the world.\n  Daniel graduated from Exeter High School in 1986, and answered the \ncall to serve our great Nation when he enlisted in the Navy on June 5, \n1990. He attended Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL School and Basic \nAirborne School from 1991-1992, and then was assigned to SEAL Delivery \nVehicle Team ONE for four years. After attending a year of extensive \nlanguage training in California, Daniel was assigned to SEAL Delivery \nTeam TWO in 1998 and was most recently stationed in Pearl Harbor, HI, \nagain with SEAL Delivery Team ONE. Daniel dutifully and confidently led \na training platoon in submerged delivery vehicles. He was deployed to \nthe Middle East in March of 2005, for what should have been a six-month \ntour. Tragically, on June 28, 2005, Daniel made the ultimate sacrifice \nfor this great Nation. Daniel and 16 other service members were killed \nwhile conducting combat operations when the MH-47 helicopter that they \nwere aboard crashed in the vicinity of Asadabad, Afghanistan in Kumar \nProvince.\n  Throughout his career, Daniel earned a series of awards which testify \nto the dedication and devotion he held for his fellow SEALS, the Navy, \nand his country. Daniel's hard work and perseverance contributed \ngreatly to his unit's successes and placed him among many of the great \nheroes and citizens that have paid the ultimate price for their \ncountry. Daniel was recognized throughout his distinguished career by \nreceiving the Navy/Marine Corps Achievement Medal, Joint Meritorious \nUnit Award, Meritorious Unit Commendation, three Good Conduct Medals, \nand three National Defense Service Medals. He also attended the Basic \nAirborne School and was a graduate of language training at the Defense \nLanguage Institute, Monterey, CA.\n  Daniel was truly an exceptional special operations warrior with more \nthan 15 years of service and an unparalleled dedication to serve his \ncounty and fellow Navy SEALs. Daniel was also a noble and selfless \nfamily man, being a compassionate husband and father of four. He leaves \nbehind a family proud of all that he had accomplished throughout his \ndistinguished life and career in the military. His valor and service \ncost him his life, but his sacrifice will live on forever among the \nmany dedicated heroes this Nation has sent abroad to defend freedom.\n  My condolences and prayers go out to Daniel's family, and I offer \nthem my deepest sympathies and most heartfelt thanks for the service, \nsacrifice, and example of their Navy SEAL, Senior Chief Petty Officer \nDaniel Healy. He was respected and admired by all those\n\n[[Page S8823]]\n\naround him, and continually performed above and beyond all expectations \nwhile in U.S. Navy. Because of his efforts, the liberty of this country \nis made more secure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/25/senate-section/article/S8823-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO ADMIRAL VERN CLARK\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor ADM \nVern Clark, U.S. Navy, our 27th Chief of Naval Operations, who last \nweek turned over the helm of the U.S. Navy to his successor. As former \nSecretary of the Navy and a member of the Armed Services Committee for \n27 years, I have worked closely with every Chief of Naval Operations \nsince Admiral Clark was Ensign Clark.\n  A child of the Midwest, Admiral Clark is a graduate of Evangel \nCollege and holds a master's degree in business administration from the \nUniversity of Arkansas. It is this Nation's great fortune that Admiral \nClark heard the call of the sea and attended Officer's Candidate \nSchool, receiving his commission in August 1968.\n  His first sea duty tour was aboard USS John W. Weeks, DD 701. One of \nthe first things Admiral Clark did upon assuming his present post was \nto obtain the picture that formally hung in the wardroom of USS John W. \nWeeks to remind him of where he came from and to keep his focus on the \nfleet.\n  Admiral Clark has had the good fortune to spend more than half of his \ncareer in command. The Navy recognized early on his potential for \nleadership when as a lieutenant he commanded USS Grand Rapids, PG98. He \nwould go on command USS McCloy, FF 1038, USS Spruance, DD 963, the \nFleet Anti-Submarine Training Center Atlantic, Destroyer Squadron One \nSeven, Destroyer Squadron Five, Cruiser Destroyer Group Three, Second \nFleet, and the U.S. Atlantic Fleet.\n  On those rare occasions when Admiral Clark was not in command, he \nserved in a series of increasingly challenging shore assignments. He \ncompleted assignments as the Special Assistant to the Director of the \nSystems Analysis Division in the Office of the Chief of Naval \nOperations, the Administrative Assistant to the Deputy Chief of Naval \nOperations, Surface Warfare, and as the Administrative Aide to the Vice \nChief of Naval Operations. He served as head of the Cruiser-Destroyer \nCombat Systems Requirements Section and Force Anti-Submarine Warfare \nOfficer for the Commander, Naval Surface Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, \nand he directed the Joint Staff's Crisis Action Team for Desert Shield \nand Desert Storm.\n  Admiral Clark first hoisted his flag aboard the U.S. Transportation \nCommand where he was Director of both Plans and Policy, J5 and \nFinancial Management and Analysis, J8. While commanding the Carl Vinson \nBattle Group, he deployed to the Arabian Gulf and later served as the \nDeputy Commander, Joint Task Force Southwest Asia. Admiral Clark has \nalso served as the Deputy and Chief of Staff, United States Atlantic \nFleet; the Director of Operations, J3 and subsequently Director of the \nJoint Staff.\n  Admiral Clark assumed his duties in peacetime on July 21, 2000. \nSitting in his office on September 11, 2001, war came to Admiral \nClark's Navy when American Airlines flight 77 hit the Pentagon just a \nfew yards from where he was sitting. Since that day he has skillfully \nled the Navy in the global war against terrorism. Throughout this time, \nhe has continued to focus on his top five priorities manpower, current \nreadiness, future readiness, quality of service and alignment. Chief \namong those priorities is manpower. Admiral Clark is fond of saying \nthat the Navy is winning the war for people. That is due in no small \npart to his leadership during this difficult time.\n  Standing beside this officer throughout his superb career has been \nhis wife Connie, a woman to whom he owes much. She has been his key \nsupporter, devoting her life to her husband, to her family, and to the \nmen and women of the Navy family. She has traveled by his side for \nthese many years visiting the fleet. Her sacrifice and devotion have \nserved as an example and inspiration for others. This team has served \nour Navy well and we will miss them both.\n  With these words before the Senate, I seek to recognize Admiral Clark \nfor his unswerving loyalty to the Navy and this great Nation. We thank \nhim and wish Vern, his wife Connie, and his sons Jeffery and \nChristopher fair winds and following seas as they continue forward in \nwhat will most assuredly remain lives of service to our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/25/senate-section/article/S8823-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 CONGRATULATING KANSAN ANDREW WOJTANIK\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK.

Andrew Wojtanik, of Overland Park, KS, won gold for the 2004 \nNational Geographic Bee, and has also published a book, called \nAfghanistan to Zimbabwe: Country Facts that Helped Me Win the National \nGeographic Bee.\n  Then 14-year old-Andrew was among three young Americans to compete \nagainst over 5 million students from all over the world. In preparation \nfor the 5 day world championship, Andrew compiled a 432-page study \nguide with information on 193 countries around the world. After \nAndrew's guide was published by National Geographic Society, he was \ncongratulated by the United States Congress on the floor of the House \nof Representatives. The House passed House Resolution 815 in honor of \nAndrew as the champion of the National Geographic World Championship.\n  Andrew Wojtanik's recognition for the Geographic Bee is well \ndeserved. His commitment to understanding the world helped America \ndefend its championship title in the 2004 National Geographic Bee.\n  Today, I join the United States Congress in recognizing and paying \ntribute to this extraordinary young American. Andrew Wojtanik is a true \nchampion, and I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing this young \nman for his outstanding achievement in the 2004 National Geographic \nWorld Championship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/25/senate-section/article/S8823-3", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TURNER COUNTY FAIR\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

From August \n14 through August 18, 2005, the citizens of Turner County will gather \nin Parker, SD, to celebrate their proud past as well as their hope for \na promising future.\n  The Turner County Fair is South Dakota's oldest fair, first organized \nby the Turner County Agricultural Society and held on October 13 and 14 \nof 1880.\n  Since then, the fair has grown into a major event. This year, more \nthan 65,000 people are expected to visit during the 4 days of \nfestivities, and fairgoers will be treated to a rich variety of \nentertainment. Scheduled activities include a parade, races, concerts, \na carnival, a livestock show, and a rodeo. The fair will end with a \nfireworks display that the local newspaper, the Southeast Trumpet, has \nadvertised as ``bigger and better than ever.''\n  I would especially like to recognize the Turner County 4-H Club for \ntheir part in this event. Turner County 4-H has played a leading role \nin the fair for the last 103 years and will figure prominently again \nthis year. The local Jaycees Club, fire department, and a number of \nother community organizations also deserve recognition for their \nparticipation in organizing and producing this event.\n  For 125 years, the Turner County Fair has brought citizens together \nto celebrate their heritage, their communities, and their shared hopes. \nIt is indeed a privilege for me to officially recognize its anniversary \ntoday, and to wish the citizens of Turner County another 125 years of \nprosperity and happiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/25/senate-section/article/S8823-4", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8823-S8824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             JUNKO CUSHMAN\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I wish to submit to the record the \nfollowing resolution regarding the passing of Junko Cushman. Beloved by \nall her friends and neighbors, Junko always found time to serve her \ncommunity. Whether\n\n[[Page S8824]]\n\nworking to bring arts and culture to her community, or improving the \nquality of healthcare, Junko always showed uncommon passion and \ndetermination in her efforts. She discovered very young that the key to \na fulfilling life is a life of helping others. Junko's community may be \nweaker for her loss, but is no doubt stronger for her service. It is my \nprivilege to honor her on the Senate floor today.\n  The resolution follows:\n\n       Whereas, the passing, at 60, of a distinguished California \n     resident, Junko Cushman, whose good deeds earned her the \n     respect and admiration of her colleagues and the countless \n     individuals whose lives she touched, brought immense sorrow \n     and loss to people throughout the state; and\n       Whereas, although she never sought attention, Junko \n     Cushman's natural sense of style and hands-on commitment to \n     charitable causes were impossible to overlook; and\n       Whereas, a Japanese-born San Diegan, she entertained with \n     international flair, excelled at multicultural floral \n     arrangements, and took a leadership role in the Union of Pan \n     Asian Communities; and\n       Whereas, Mrs. Cushman served as chairwoman of events \n     benefiting the San Diego Museum of Art and the Arthritis \n     Foundation and had been on the boards of the Old Globe \n     Theatre, San Diego Foundation, and Burnham Cancer Institute; \n     and\n       Whereas, Mrs. Cushman dedicated her time and service to San \n     Diego State University's Japanese Cultural Fair in Balboa \n     Park; and\n       Whereas, in 1987, Mrs. Cushman served as Chairwoman of a \n     Union of Pan Asian Communities dinner dance on Harbor Island \n     and, in 1989, she played a similar role for the Arthritis \n     Foundation; and\n       Whereas, Over the years, Mrs. Cushman has shown her strong \n     support for California's political system through her \n     affiliation with the Democratic Party; and\n       Whereas, in 1989, Mrs. Cushman and her husband, Larry, were \n     honored for their community service at a Meals on Wheels \n     dinner dance; and\n       Whereas, born in Nagano, Japan, and raised in Tokyo, Mrs. \n     Cushman graduated from the prominent Tamagawa High School \n     and, at age 19, she moved to Los Angeles, California, where \n     she studied English for two years before returning to Japan; \n     and\n       Whereas, she leaves to mourn her passing and celebrate her \n     legacy her husband; Larry; her brother, Hisato Hara; her \n     stepdaughters, Diane Cushman and Janice Ziegler; her \n     grandson, Zachary; her two granddaughters, Ashley and Sarah; \n     her niece Mari; and her nephew Yasuto; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by Assembly Member Juan Vargas, That he expresses \n     his deepest regret at the passing of Junko Cushman, and \n     extends his heartfelt sympathy to her bereaved family and \n     friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/25/senate-section/article/S8824-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/25/senate-section/article/S8824-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/25/senate-section/article/S8824-3", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 7:28 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 571.

 By Mr. DOMENICI:\n  S. 1478. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 regarding \nthe definition of a high need local educational agency, the definition \nof a Hispanic-serving institution, and the 2-year wait out period for \ncertain grant recipients; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Higher Education Act of 1965 was \nsigned into law for the purpose of increasing access to higher \neducation for all citizens of the United States and to strengthen the \ncapacity of higher education institutions to better serve their \ncommunities. The reauthorization of the Higher Education Act during the \n109th Congress presents a powerful opportunity for the Nation to \naddress the higher education needs of our constituencies and it is for \nthis reason that I rise today to introduce the Improving Educational \nOpportunities for All Act. This bill will make changes to definitions \nlocated within title II, teacher quality enhancement grants, and title \nV, the development institutions sections of the Higher Education Act.\n\n[[Page S8829]]\n\n  When the Higher Education Act was reauthorized in 1998, Congress \nresponded to the Nation's critical need for high-quality teachers by \ncreating grants to help States invest in the recruitment, preparation, \nlicensing, and support of teachers. Title II of the Higher Education \nAct, the teacher quality enhancement grants initiative, encourages \nStates to improve the quality of their teaching force through such \nreforms as strengthening teacher certification standards; holding \ninstitutions of higher education accountable for preparing teachers \nwith strong teaching skills and knowledge of their content areas; and \nreducing shortages of qualified teachers in high-need areas. I believe \nthat these grants have been very effective in meeting their goals, but \nI also want to make sure that this money is targeted to our highest \nneed local education agencies.\n  The changes I am proposing to title II of the Higher Education Act \nwill enhance the definition of high need local education agencies to \ninclude local education agencies that have a high percentage of \nstudents who are minority or of limited English proficiency, residing \nin rural areas as defined by the Bureau of Census, or have high \npercentages of Naive American students.\n  Nationwide, studies show the most disadvantaged children are the ones \nmost likely to be taught by the newest, least-qualified and lowest-\nscoring teachers. We need to attract good teachers who are committed to \ntheir profession, and reward teachers who are qualified and want to \nteach in areas of most critical need. We need teachers to be well-\nprepared to teach all students to the highest standards and I hope that \nthe changes I am proposing will help States develop and implement \nprograms to meet these needs. \n  Another positive addition to the Higher Education Act, has been the \ncreation of title V grants to developing institutions. Title V of the \nHigher Education Act is the primary vehicle used to target urgently \nneeded funds to Hispanic serving institutions, HSIs. HSI's use grants \nunder this section to strengthen academic quality, improve \ninstitutional management, and increase financial stability. These \ngrants are essential to institutions that provide and increase the \nnumber of educational opportunities available to Hispanic students.\n  Under current guidelines, in order to qualify for a grant under title \nV, an institution must, have at least 25 percent full time, Hispanic \nundergraduate student enrollment, and not less than 50 percent of its \nHispanic student population must be low income. Title V grants are \nawarded for 5 years, with a minimum 2-year wait out period after the \ntermination of a grant period before eligibility to apply for another \ngrant.\n  The first change I am proposing is a change to title V's current ``50 \npercent'' low-income assurance requirement. I believe that this \nrequirement is an unnecessary bureaucratic regulation that constrains \nHispanic serving institutions abilities to implement programs designed \nto provide long range solutions to Hispanic higher education \nchallenges. Currently, there are no Government authorized means to \ncollect student financial data, and, although some information  can be \nextrapolated from student financial aid forms, it is not enough \ninformation to complete the title V forms.\n  The bill I am introducing today will improve the HSI eligibility \nrequirements by allowing applicants for title V funding to satisfy the \n50 percent low-income Hispanic student population criterion with \nappropriate evidence of student eligibility for title IV, need-based, \naid. The revised title V section will retain the requirement that to be \neligible for title V funds, an institution must have an enrollment of \nneedy students. However, rather than conditioning grant qualification \nupon the cumbersome requirement that institutions prove 50 percent of \ntheir Hispanic students are low income, it will allow institutions to \nqualify for title V money if 50 percent of the students are receiving \nneed-based assistance under title IV or a substantial percentage of the \nstudents are receiving Pell grants.\n  Another unnecessary regulation under title V is the minimum 2-year \nwait out period after the termination of a grant period before \neligibility to apply for another grant. Title V's 2-year  wait out \nperiod impedes Hispanic Serving Institutions efforts to implement \ncontinuing programs with long range solutions to Hispanic higher \neducation challenges. Eliminating the 2-year wait out period will be of \ngreat importance to equipping our Nation's Hispanic serving \ninstitutions with the continuous funding that they need to best answer \ncomplex challenges. In 2000, Congress eliminated the wait out period \nfor tribally controlled colleges and universities, Alaskan Native and \nNative Hawaiian-serving institutions. Historically Black colleges and \nuniversities also do not have a wait out period. It is now time for us \nto eliminate the wait out period for Hispanic serving institutions.\n  Hispanic serving institutions provide the quality education essential \nto full participation in today's society. Many students in my home \nState of New Mexico have benefited from the academic excellence that \nHispanic serving institutions seek to provide. Title V grants are \nintended to provide assistance to these less advantaged, developing \ninstitutions. However, by convoluting the application process, Congress \nis preventing these institutions from applying for grants and \nobstructing their development.\n  I know that the chairman and ranking member of the Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions committee have been working very hard on the \nreauthorization of the Higher Education Act. I appreciate their \nefforts, and hope they will consider making the changes I am \nrecommending.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1478\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the expansion of Federal efforts \nconcerning the prevention, education, treatment, and research \nactivities related to Lyme and other tick-borne diseases, including the \nestablishment of a Tick-Borne Diseases Advisory Committee; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1479\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Lyme and Tick-borne Disease \n     Prevention, Education, and Research Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Lyme disease is a common but frequently misunderstood \n     illness that, if not caught early and treated properly, can \n     cause serious health problems.\n       (2) Lyme disease is a bacterial infection that is \n     transmitted by a tick bite. Early signs of infection may \n     include a rash and flu-\n\n[[Page S8830]]\n\n     like symptoms such as fever, muscle aches, headaches, and \n     fatigue.\n       (3) Although Lyme disease can be treated with antibiotics \n     if caught early, the disease often goes undetected because it \n     mimics other illnesses or may be misdiagnosed. Untreated, \n     Lyme disease can lead to severe heart, neurological, eye, and \n     joint problems because the bacteria can affect many different \n     organs and organ systems.\n       (4) If an individual with Lyme disease does not receive \n     treatment, such individual can develop severe heart, \n     neurological, eye, and joint problems.\n       (5) Although Lyme disease accounts for 90 percent of all \n     vector-borne infections in the United States, the ticks that \n     spread Lyme disease also spread other diseases, such as \n     ehrlichiosis, babesiosis, and other strains of Borrelia. All \n     of these diseases in 1 patient makes diagnosis and treatment \n     more difficult.\n       (6) Studies indicate that the actual number of tick-borne \n     disease cases are approximately 10 times the amount reported.\n       (7) Persistence of symptomatology in many patients without \n     reliable testing makes treatment of patients more difficult.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 207\n\n       Whereas July 26, 2005, marks the 15th anniversary of the \n     enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990;\n       Whereas prior to the passage of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act, it was commonplace for individuals with \n     disabilities to experience discrimination in all aspects of \n     their everyday lives--in employment, housing, public \n     accommodations, education, transportation, communication, \n     recreation, voting, and access to public services;\n       Whereas prior to the passage of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act, individuals with disabilities often were \n     the subject of stereotypes and prejudices that did not \n     reflect their abilities, talents, and eagerness to fully \n     contribute to our society and economy;\n       Whereas the dedicated efforts of disability rights \n     advocates, such as Justin Dart, Jr. and others too numerous \n     to mention, served to awaken Congress and the American people \n     to the discrimination and prejudice faced by individuals with \n     disabilities;\n       Whereas Congress worked in a bipartisan manner to craft \n     legislation making such discrimination illegal and opening \n     doors of opportunity to individuals with disabilities;\n       Whereas Congress passed the Americans with Disabilities Act \n     and President George Herbert Walker Bush signed the Act into \n     law on July 26, 1990;\n       Whereas the Americans with Disabilities Act pledged to \n     fulfill the Nation's goals of equality of opportunity, \n     economic self-sufficiency, full participation, and \n     independent living for individuals with disabilities;\n       Whereas the Americans with Disabilities Act prohibited \n     employers from discriminating against qualified individuals \n     with disabilities, required that State and local governmental \n     entities accommodate qualified individuals with disabilities, \n     encouraged places of public accommodation to take reasonable \n     steps to make their goods and services accessible to \n     individuals with disabilities, and required that new trains \n     and buses be accessible;\n       Whereas since 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act has \n     played an historic role in allowing some 54,000,000 Americans \n     with disabilities to participate more fully in our national \n     life by removing barriers in employment, transportation, \n     public services, telecommunications, and public \n     accommodations;\n       Whereas accommodations such as curb cuts, ramps, accessible \n     trains and buses, accessible stadiums, accessible \n     telecommunications, and accessible Web sites have become \n     commonplace since passage of the Americans with Disabilities \n     Act, benefitting not only individuals with disabilities but \n     all Americans; and\n       Whereas the Americans with Disabilities Act is our Nation's \n     landmark civil rights legislation for people with \n     disabilities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes and honors the 15th anniversary of the \n     enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990;\n       (2) salutes all people whose efforts contributed to the \n     enactment of such Act; and\n       (3) encourages all Americans to celebrate the advance of \n     freedom and the opening of opportunity made possible by the \n     enactment of such Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/25/senate-section/article/S8831-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8831-S8832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 208--COMMEMORATING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n              NATIONAL CITIZENS' CRIME PREVENTION CAMPAIGN\n\n  Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Leahy) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I seek recognition today to submit a \nSenate Resolution commemorating the 25th anniversary of the National \nCitizens' Crime Prevention Campaign. This effort is being led by the \nNational Crime Prevention Council, NCPC, and its icon, McGruff the \nCrime Dog.\n  NCPC is a private, nonprofit educational organization. NCPC is well \nknown by the general public for coordinating the public service \nadvertising efforts featuring McGruff. Yet the National Crime \nPrevention Council provides comprehensive crime prevention technical \nassistance and training to communities throughout the United States; \ndevelops and implements highly acclaimed and innovative programs; and \ndisseminates information on effective crime prevention practices to \nthousands of individuals and organizations every year. The council also \npublishes books, program kits, posters, and consumer education \nmaterials that can be localized by crime prevention activists \neverywhere.\n  On July 1, 2005, the National Citizens' Crime Prevention Campaign and \nMcGruff the Crime Dog celebrated their 25th anniversary. I, along with \nSenator Leahy, acknowledge this significant milestone with a resolution \nthat: 1. Commemorates the 25th anniversary and commends all individuals \nand organizations involved in the Campaign for advancing the principles \nand practices of effective crime prevention; 2. Asks all Americans to \njoin in the celebration of the 25th anniversary; and 3. Encourages the \nefforts of the National Citizens' Crime Prevention Campaign to promote \nindividual and collective action, in collaboration with law enforcement \nand other supporting agencies, to reduce crime and build safer \ncommunities throughout the United States of America.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to join my friend and colleague, \nSenator Specter, in submitting this bipartisan resolution commemorating \nthe 25th anniversary of the National Citizens' Crime Prevention \nCampaign, which is managed by the National Crime Prevention Council. I \napplaud all individuals and organizations involved in the Campaign for \ntheir efforts to advance the principles and practice of effective crime \nprevention throughout the United States.\n\n[[Page S8832]]\n\n  We have all been urged over the years by McGruff the Crime Dog, the \nCampaign's icon, to ``Take A Bite Out Of Crime'' a simple and effective \nslogan to help begin to educate and make the public aware of the \nimportance of crime prevention. Through their leadership, the Campaign \nand McGruff have played vital roles in reducing crime and making our \ncommunities safer.\n  The Campaign was the first public education program on crime \nprevention in the country. It is designed to stimulate community \ninvolvement, generate confidence in comprehensive crime prevention \nactivities and provide a national focus and resource for crime \nprevention programs nationwide. When it was formally launched in 1979, \nmost Americans viewed crime as inevitable and its prevention as the job \nof the police. Today, three out of four Americans believe that they can \npersonally take actions to reduce crime and that their neighborhoods \nand communities can act to prevent crime. A major force behind this \nshift to a more positive attitude is the National Citizens' Crime \nPrevention Campaign.\n  Crime prevention is central to maintaining a sound criminal justice \nsystem at the national, State, and local levels, and to ensuring safer \nand more secure communities. Making prevention a priority through the \nNational Citizens' Crime Prevention Campaign is a collective effort. \nThis alliance of national, State and Federal organizations works with \nbusinesses, civic groups, individuals and law enforcement to generate \ncrime prevention awareness and action throughout the country through a \nvariety of mechanisms.\n  The National Citizens' Crime Prevention Campaign has inspired and \ndirected millions of citizens to take action, individually and \ncollectively, to reduce crime, drug abuse and the fear of crime. I look \nforward to another 25 years and beyond of McGruff and the Campaign, \nunder the skilled leadership of its President and CEO, Al Lenhardt, who \nis the former Sergeant At Arms of the U.S. Senate, continuing to be \nnational leaders in improving the quality of life in every community \nthrough crime prevention. I have no doubt that together they will \ncontinue to promote individual and collective action, in collaboration \nwith law enforcement and other supporting agencies, to reduce crime and \nbuild safer communities throughout the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/25/senate-section/article/S8832-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8832-S8833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 209--TO STRENGTHEN FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY BY IMPROVING \n               SENATE CONSIDERATION OF CONFERENCE REPORTS\n\n  Mr. CONRAD (for himself and Mr. McCain) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration:\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased that Senator McCain is \njoining me today in submitting a bipartisan Senate resolution to \nstrengthen fiscal responsibility and restore some common sense to the \nconsideration of conference reports in the Senate.\n  Last November the Senate received an omnibus appropriations \nconference report that totaled 3,646 pages. It included nine different \nappropriations bills, seven of which had never been debated, amended or \nvoted on by the Senate. It spent more than $388 billion. And it also \nincluded a miscellaneous title with several extraneous provisions that \nhad nothing to do with appropriations. Like the appropriations titles, \nmany of these non-appropriations items had never been considered in the \nSenate.\n  Even though the vast majority of the Senate had never had a chance to \nreview these provisions, the conference report was rushed to the Senate \nfloor just hours after a handful of members and their staff had \nfinished their work putting it together behind closed doors.\n  Throughout the day, I and several members of my staff read and \nanalyzed the provisions of this bill. During the examination, we \ndiscovered a particularly egregious provision. It would have allowed an \nagent of the Chairman of the House or Senate Appropriations Committee \nto look at the tax return of anyone in America. And, further, it would \nhave allowed them to release the private information contained in those \nreturns without any civil or criminal penalty. That would have created \nthe opportunity for an abuse of power almost unprecedented in our \nhistory.\n  Thankfully, my staff and I were able to catch this, and after \nstrenuous debate the provision was nullified. But this is an indication \nof how completely flawed this process has become. None of us could know \nwhen the time came to vote, just a few hours after the bill was \nreleased, what other inappropriate provisions it contained. There \nsimply had not been enough time to thoroughly scour the more than 3,600 \npages in this bill.\n  Unfortunately, this is not an isolated example. Over the past several \nyears, we have seen increased abuses of the conference process. There \nhas been a trend toward a handful of members writing legislation in \nsecret, without full opportunity for minority participation or thorough \ndebate in the Senate. In addition to the omnibus appropriations bills \nwe have seen in the past several years, there are several other \nexamples of this trend.\n  Last year, for example, the majority leadership was unwilling or \nunable to move a bill through the Senate to extend expiring tax \nprovisions. Apparently, the leadership did not want to vote on \namendments to pay for these provisions, and it did not want to debate \nthe fiscal irresponsibility of its tax policy.\n  So what did the leadership do? It took a modest tax relief measure \naimed at making the child tax credit more useful to low- and middle-\nincome families that had languished in conference for over a year, and \nturned it into a $146 billion revenue loser that extended the 2001 tax \ncuts relating to the child credit, marriage penalty, and the 10 percent \nmarginal rate bracket through 2010. The conferees also tacked on \ntraditional extenders, R, work opportunity tax credit, etc., added a \nyear of AMT relief, and dropped the revenue offsets that had covered \nall but about $250 million of the original cost. No Democrats \nparticipated in the conference, and the Senate had no opportunity to \ndebate the merits of these individual provisions or offer amendments to \noffset their costs.\n  But it is not just tax and appropriations bills that have been \nhijacked in conference. On issue after issue, we have had conferences \nwhere the minority was excluded so that the majority could ram through \nunpopular provisions as part of an un-amendable conference report.\n  That is not right. We should not be writing brand new legislation in \nconference in order to bypass Senate consideration. We should not be \nbundling together 3,646 page conference reports in the middle of the \nnight and asking Senators to vote on them without the opportunity for \nthorough review and debate. It is clear to me the conference process is \nbroken. Former President Ronald Reagan in his 1988 State of the Union \nAddress told us we should not do business this way, in omnibus \nconference reports that no Senator has an opportunity to fully \nunderstand before they are voted on. He was right.\n  The Conrad-McCain resolution would address these problems. It would \nimprove Senate consideration of conference reports in five simple, \ncommon-sense ways.\n  First, our resolution would require conference reports to be filed \nand made available for at least 48 hours prior to Senate consideration. \nUnder our resolution, all Senators would have the opportunity to know \nwhat is in each and every conference report that comes before this \nbody.\n  Second, our resolution would require a written cost estimate or table \nby the Congressional Budget Office prior to Senate consideration of any \nconference report. Senators desereve to know before they vote on a bill \nhow much it will cost.\n  Third, our resolution would require that a bill coming out of \nconference be primarily in the jurisdiction of the same committee, or \nappropriations subcommittee, as the Senate-passed bill that was \nsubmitted to conference. We should not be sending a $19 billion foreign \noperations appropriations bill to conference and having it come back as \na close-to $400 billion bill that includes Labor-Health and Human \nServices and other domestic spending. This will help ensure that the \nSenate considers each bill before it comes back from conference.\n  If any of those three conditions are not met, our resolution would \nallow any Senator to raise a point of order\n\n[[Page S8833]]\n\nagainst the conference report. That point of order be waived only with \na vote of 60 Senators.\n  In addition, the Conrad-McCain resolution would strengthen current \nrules that are designed to prohibit extraneous provisions in conference \nreports. Extraneous provisions are those that are either outside the \nscope of the bills that the House and Senate sent to conference, or in \nthe jurisdiction of some other committee.\n  Provisions that are either outside the scope of conference or in \nanother committee's jurisdiction could be stricken from the conference \nreport on a point of order made by any Senator. That point of order \ncould be waived only with a vote of 60 Senators. Importantly, the point \nof order would not bring down the entire conference report. Instead, it \nwill only remove the extraneous matter, leaving the rest of the \nconference report intact. This change--similar to the application of \nthe Byrd rule on reconciliation bills--will remove a significant \nimpediment to challenging attempts to push unpopular riders through the \nSenate on unrelated but otherwise popular legislation.\n  This common-sense legislation is long overdue. Our political process \nhas become too bogged down with bloated spending bills and special-\ninterest tax break legislation. Too often, it is not until after a \nconference report has passed that its true cost comes to light. Massive \nand unwieldy bills have become almost routine in the Senate. This has \nto stop.\n  Our resolution would improve the legislative process while \nstrengthening fiscal responsibility in a way that is simple, \nstraightforward, and reasonable. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n                              S. Res. 209\n\n     SECTION 1. CONFERENCE REPORTS OUT OF ORDER.\n\n       (a) Availability.--It shall not be in order to consider a \n     report of a committee of conference under paragraph 1 of rule \n     XXVIII of the Standing Rules of the Senate unless such report \n     is filed and made available 48 hours prior to presentation.\n       (b) Cost Estimate or Table.--It shall not be in order to \n     consider a report of a committee of conference under \n     paragraph 1 of rule XXVIII of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate unless an official written cost estimate or table by \n     the Congressional Budget Office is available at the time of \n     consideration.\n       (c) Jurisdiction.--It shall not be in order to consider a \n     report of a committee of conference under paragraph 1 of rule \n     XXVIII of the Standing Rules of the Senate if the \n     preponderance of matter in the conference report is not in \n     the jurisdiction of the committee (or Appropriations \n     subcommittee for one of the regular appropriation bills) that \n     had jurisdiction of the Senate passed bill submitted to \n     conference.\n       (d) Supermajority Waiver and Appeal.--This section may be \n     waived or suspended in the Senate only by an affirmative vote \n     of \\3/5\\ of the Members, duly chosen and sworn. An \n     affirmative vote of \\3/5\\ of the Members of the Senate, duly \n     chosen and sworn, shall be required in the Senate to sustain \n     an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order \n     raised under this section.\n\n     SEC. 2. EXTRANEOUS PROVISIONS OF CONFERENCE REPORTS OUT OF \n                   ORDER.\n\n       (a) Provisions Outside Scope of Conference.--It shall not \n     be in order to consider a report of a committee of conference \n     under paragraph 1 of rule XXVIII of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate if it contains extraneous material outside the scope \n     of conference under rule XXVIII of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate.\n       (b) Provisions Outside Jurisdiction.--It shall not be in \n     order to consider a report of a committee of conference under \n     paragraph 1 of rule XXVIII of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate if it contains extraneous material in the jurisdiction \n     of a committee other than a committee from whom conferees \n     were appointed.\n       (c) Form of Point of Order.--It shall be in order for a \n     Senator to raise a single point of order that several \n     provisions of a bill, resolution, amendment, motion, or \n     conference report violate this section. The Presiding Officer \n     may sustain the point of order as to some or all of the \n     provisions against which the Senator raised the point of \n     order. If the Presiding Officer so sustains the point of \n     order as to some of the provisions against which the Senator \n     raised the point of order, then only those provisions against \n     which the Presiding Officer sustains the point of order shall \n     be deemed stricken pursuant to this section.

More than 51 percent of our citizen \n     soldiers take a pay cut when they are deployed, and 11 \n     percent of them lose more than $2,500 per month.\n       (4) The pay gap can make it difficult for military families \n     to make ends meet while a member of the National Guard or the \n     Reserves is mobilized.\n       (5) There are hundreds, if not thousands, of patriotic \n     employers that continue to pay the salaries of members of the \n     National Guard and the Reserves who are called or ordered to \n     active duty.\n       (6) Some of these employers not only continue to pay \n     salaries to their employees who are members of the National \n     Guard or the Reserves on active duty, they often need to hire \n     a temporary employee to keep their businesses going while \n     such employees are on active duty.\n       (7) While these patriotic employers make this sacrifice, \n     there are thousands more who cannot afford to do so.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the tax provisions under budget reconciliation should contain \n     provisions to provide tax relief to employers who make up the \n     pay gap for their employees who are called or ordered to \n     active duty in the National Guard or the Reserves.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1457.

Mr. JOHNSON submitted an amendment intended to be proposed \nby him to the bill S. 1042, to authorize appropriations for fiscal year \n2006 for military activities of the Department of Defense, for military \nconstruction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, \nto prescribe personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed \nForces, and for other purposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; \nas follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n  TITLE __--FULL RECOGNITION OF SACRIFICE AND VALOR OF UNITED STATES \n                            SERVICE MEMBERS\n\n                          Subtitle A--Findings\n\n     SEC. __01. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In his prepared testimony for the June 28, 2005, \n     hearing of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate, \n     Secretary R. James Nicholson reported that over 103,000 \n     veterans of the Global War on Terrorism, including operations \n     in Iraq, are projected to seek health care from the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs during fiscal year 2005.\n       (2) In his prepared testimony for the May 19, 2005, hearing \n     of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the House of \n     Representatives, Department of Veterans Affairs Seamless \n     Transition Office Director John Brown testified that--\n       (A) over 85,000 veterans of the Global War on Terrorism, \n     including operations in Iraq, had already sought care from \n     the Department of Veterans Affairs; and\n       (B) 24 percent of all veterans returning from these \n     operations were seeking health care from the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs.\n       (3) In his testimony before the Subcommittee on Defense of \n     the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate on May 11, \n     2005, Air Force Surgeon General Lieutenant General George \n     Peach Taylor, Jr. testified that over 55,000 service members \n     had been medically evacuated since the beginning of Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom.\n       (4) The Department of Defense reports that, through July \n     22, 2005--\n       (A) 13,559 service members had been wounded in action in \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom; and\n       (B) 511 service members had been wounded in action in \n     Operation Enduring Freedom.\n       (5) The number of wounded service members reported wounded \n     by the Department of Defense constitute less than \\1/6\\ of \n     the number of veterans reported to have already sought health \n     care from the Department of Veterans' Affairs, a number which \n     excludes wounded service members still serving on active duty \n     in the Armed Services and wounded service members who sought \n     health care from private physicians.\n       (6) In his testimony before the June 28, 2005, hearing of \n     the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate, Secretary \n     Nicholson estimated that the Department of Veterans Affairs \n     will experience a $1,300,000,000 funding shortfall for fiscal \n     year 2005 and a $1,700,000,000 funding shortfall for fiscal \n     year 2006, in large part because of the Department's \n     inability to plan for the increased workload experienced as a \n     result of large numbers of veterans returning from Operations \n     Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom and seeking health care \n     from the Department.\n       (7) It is impossible for the Department of Veterans Affairs \n     to estimate, and for Congress to appropriate, the resources \n     necessary to ensure that the Department of Veterans Affairs \n     can adequately provide quality health care to veterans \n     returning home from Operation Iraqi Freedom and other \n     critical operations if the number of wounded and disabled \n     service members is not accurately reported.\n\n Subtitle B--Accounting for Casualties Incurred in the Prosecution of \n                      the Global War on Terrorism\n\n     SEC. _11.

THE UNITED STATES-CHINA ECONOMIC AND SECURITY \n                   REVIEW COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The 2004 Report to Congress of the United States-China \n     Economic and Security Review Commission states that--\n       (A) China's State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) lack adequate \n     disclosure standards, which creates the potential for United \n     States investors to unwittingly contribute to enterprises \n     that are involved in activities harmful to United States \n     security interests;\n       (B) United States influence and vital long-term interests \n     in Asia are being challenged by China's robust regional \n     economic engagement and diplomacy;\n       (C) the assistance of China and North Korea to global \n     ballistic missile proliferation is extensive and ongoing;\n       (D) China's transfers of technology and components for \n     weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their delivery systems \n     to countries of concern, including countries that support \n     acts of international terrorism, has helped create a new tier \n     of countries with the capability to produce WMD and ballistic \n     missiles;\n       (E) the removal of the European Union arms embargo against \n     China that is currently under consideration in the European \n     Union would accelerate weapons modernization and dramatically \n     enhance Chinese military capabilities;\n       (F) China's recent actions toward Taiwan call into question \n     China's commitments to a peaceful resolution;\n       (G) China is developing a leading-edge military with the \n     objective of intimidating Taiwan and deterring United States \n     involvement in the Strait, and China's qualitative and \n     quantitative military advancements have already resulted in a \n     dramatic shift in the cross-Strait military balance toward \n     China; and\n       (H) China's growing energy needs are driving China into \n     bilateral arrangements that undermine multilateral efforts to \n     stabilize oil supplies and prices, and in some cases may \n     involve dangerous weapons transfers.\n       (2) On March 14, 2005, the National People's Congress \n     approved a law that would authorize the use of force if \n     Taiwan formally declares independence.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--\n       (1) Plan.--The President is strongly urged to take \n     immediate steps to establish a plan to implement the \n     recommendations contained in the 2004 Report to Congress of \n     the United States-China Economic and Security Review \n     Commission in order to correct the negative implications that \n     a number of current trends in United States-China relations \n     have for United States long-term economic and national \n     security interests.\n       (2) Contents.--Such a plan should contain the following:\n       (A) Actions to address China's policy of undervaluing its \n     currency, including--\n       (i) encouraging China to provide for a substantial upward \n     revaluation of the Chinese yuan against the United States \n     dollar;\n       (ii) allowing the yuan to float against a trade-weighted \n     basket of currencies; and\n       (iii) concurrently encouraging United States trading \n     partners with similar interests to join in these efforts.\n       (B) Actions to make better use of the World Trade \n     Organization (WTO) dispute settlement mechanism and \n     applicable United States trade laws to redress China's unfair \n     trade practices, including China's exchange rate \n     manipulation, denial of trading and distribution rights, lack \n     of intellectual property rights protection, objectionable \n     labor standards, subsidization of exports, and forced \n     technology transfers as a condition of doing business. The \n     United States Trade Representative should consult with our \n     trading partners regarding any trade dispute with China.\n       (C) Actions to encourage United States diplomatic efforts \n     to identify and pursue initiatives to revitalize United \n     States engagement with China's Asian neighbors. The \n     initiatives should have a regional focus and complement \n     bilateral efforts. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation \n     forum (APEC) offers a ready mechanism for pursuit of such \n     initiatives.\n       (D) Actions by the administration to hold China accountable \n     for proliferation of prohibited technologies and to secure \n     China's agreement to renew efforts to curtail North Korea's \n     commercial export of ballistic missiles.\n       (E) Actions by the Secretaries of State and Energy to \n     consult with the International Energy Agency with the \n     objective of upgrading the current loose experience-sharing \n     arrangement, whereby China engages in some limited exchanges \n     with the organization, to a more structured arrangement \n     whereby China would be obligated to develop a meaningful \n     strategic oil reserve, and coordinate release of stocks in \n     supply-disruption crises or speculator-driven price spikes.\n       (F) Actions by the administration to develop a coordinated, \n     comprehensive national policy and strategy designed to meet \n     China's challenge to maintaining United States scientific and \n     technological leadership and competitiveness in the same way \n     the administration is presently required to develop and \n     publish a national security strategy.\n       (G) Actions to review laws and regulations governing the \n     Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), \n     including exploring whether the definition of national \n     security should include the potential impact on national \n     economic security as a criterion to be reviewed, and whether \n     the chairmanship of CFIUS should be transferred from the \n     Secretary of the Treasury to a more appropriate executive \n     branch agency.\n\n[[Page S8848]]\n\n       (H) Actions by the President and the Secretaries of State \n     and Defense to press strongly their European Union \n     counterparts to maintain the EU arms embargo on China.\n       (I) Actions by the administration to discourage foreign \n     defense contractors from selling sensitive military use \n     technology or weapons systems to China. The administration \n     should provide a comprehensive annual report to the \n     appropriate committees of Congress on the nature and scope of \n     foreign military sales to China, particularly sales by Russia \n     and Israel.\n       (J) Any additional actions outlined in the 2004 Report to \n     Congress of the United States-China Economic and Security \n     Review Commission that affect the economic or national \n     security of the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1477.

REPORT ON NUCLEAR WEAPONS DEVELOPMENT IN NORTH \n                   KOREA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since the 1993 announcement by officials of the \n     Government of North Korea that North Korea intended to \n     withdraw from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \n     Weapons, done at Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968 \n     (21 UST 483) (hereinafter referred to as the ``Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty''), the United States and its allies \n     have carried out a number of diplomatic initiatives to \n     address concerns related to nuclear weapons development in \n     North Korea.\n       (2) Diplomatic negotiations led to the Agreed Framework \n     between the United States and North Korea, signed in Geneva \n     October 21, 1994 (hereinafter referred to as the ``Agreed \n     Framework''), under which more than 8,000 plutonium spent \n     fuel rods suitable for reprocessing into weapons grade \n     material were kept under international monitoring.\n       (3) During the period that the Agreed Framework has not \n     been in effect since 2002--\n       (A) officials of the Government of North Korea have \n     indicated North Korea has reprocessed all of the 8,000 \n     plutonium spent fuel rods that were previously under \n     international monitoring so that such rods are in a form \n     suitable for use in multiple nuclear weapons;\n       (B) North Korea has withdrawn from the Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty; and\n       (C) officials of the Government of North Korea have \n     indicated that North Korea has restarted its known plutonium-\n     based reactor at Yongbyon which allows North Korea to prepare \n     more nuclear weapons material.\n       (4) Since 2002, the United States diplomatic strategy with \n     respect to nuclear materials in North Korea has centered on a \n     six party talks process, the last meeting of which occurred \n     in June 2004, and next meeting of which is expected to begin \n     on July 26, 2005.\n       (5) Complete and open debate by Congress and the people of \n     the United States of the national security interests and an \n     accurate assessment of the diplomatic options available to \n     the United States with respect to North Korea require that \n     the most complete data regarding nuclear materials \n     development in North Korea be made available.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States negotiators in the process of six \n     party talks regarding the development of nuclear materials in \n     North Korea should be fully empowered with the flexibility to \n     negotiate meaningfully to seek agreements and understandings \n     that advance toward the goal of a denuclearized North Korea, \n     as such agreements and understandings are in the national \n     security interest of the United States; and\n       (2) such six party talks should occur in an ongoing, \n     regular, and frequent basis.\n       (c) Report.--\n       (1) Requirement.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to \n     Congress a report on the development of nuclear materials in \n     North Korea. Such report shall include--\n       (A) an estimate of the number of nuclear weapons that the \n     President believes that it is likely that North Korea \n     produced--\n       (i) prior to the signing of the Agreed Framework in 1994;\n       (ii) during the period from 1994 through 2002 that the \n     Agreed Framework was in effect; and\n       (iii) after the date that the United States and North Korea \n     ceased adhering to the Agreed Framework in 2002; and\n       (B) an assessment of the number of plutonium and uranium-\n     based nuclear weapons that the President--\n       (i) believes that North Korea has control of on the date of \n     the enactment of the Act; and\n       (ii) projects that North Korea could have control of on the \n     dates that are 1, 3, 5, and 10 years after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act if diplomatic efforts to prevent the \n     proliferation of nuclear materials in North Korea are \n     unsuccessful.\n       (2) Form of report.--The report required by paragraph (1) \n     shall be submitted in an unclassified form.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1485.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON UNITED STATES PARTICIPATION \n                   IN REVIEW CONFERENCES OF THE PARTIES TO TREATY \n                   ON THE NON-PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, \n     done at Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968 (21 UST \n     483) (hereinafter referred to as the ``Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty''), which has 188 party countries, is \n     the centerpiece of the international regime to prevent the \n     spread of nuclear weapons.\n       (2) Since 1975, a Review Conference of the Parties to the \n     Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons has been \n     held every five years to review the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \n     Treaty, evaluate the progress has been made, and assess the \n     additional steps that must be carried out to prevent the \n     spread of nuclear weapons.\n       (3) The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty must be \n     strengthened to respond to current proliferation challenges, \n     and the leadership of the United States is crucial in such \n     effort.\n       (4) The United States was represented at each of the first \n     four Review Conferences, which were held during 1975, 1980, \n     1985, and 1990, by an official no lower than the equivalent \n     of a Deputy Secretary of State, who reported directly to the \n     Secretary of State, and at the last two conferences, which \n     were held during 1995 and 2000, the United States was \n     represented by the Vice President and the Secretary of State.\n       (5) The Assistant Secretary for Arms Control of the \n     Department of State, who reports to the Secretary of State \n     through the Undersecretary for Arms Control and International \n     Security Affairs and the Deputy Secretary of State, \n     represented the United\n\n[[Page S8850]]\n\n     States at the 2005 Review Conference and was the lowest-level \n     representative ever to represent the United States at a \n     Review Conference.\n       (6) The level of United States representation at Review \n     Conferences affects the ability of the United States \n     Government to exert leadership in strengthening the \n     international nuclear nonproliferation regime.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Secretary of State should represent the United \n     States at all future Review Conferences of the Parties to the \n     Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons;\n       (2) not later than 90 days prior to the start of each \n     Review Conference or any preparatory conference to the \n     Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the President should submit \n     to Congress a plan that outlines the United States objectives \n     for the Review Conference or preparatory conference and a \n     comprehensive strategy for achieving such objectives; and\n       (3) not later than 90 days after the conclusion of a Review \n     Conference or any such preparatory conference or, with \n     respect to the Review Conference held during 2005, not later \n     than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     President should submit to Congress an after-action review of \n     the Review Conference or preparatory conference, including an \n     assessment of which United States objectives related to \n     strengthening international nuclear nonproliferation efforts \n     were achieved and which such objectives were not achieved \n     during the Review Conference or preparatory conference.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1486. Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Obama) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by him to the bill S. 1042, to authorize \nappropriations for fiscal year 2006 for military activities of the \nDepartment of Defense, for military construction, and for defense \nactivities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe personnel \nstrengths for such fiscal year for the Armed Forces, and for other \npurposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the end of title XII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1205. UPDATE OF UNITED STATES STRATEGY TO COMBAT THE \n                   PROLIFERATION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On February 11, 2004, President George W. Bush stated \n     that ``the greatest threat before humanity today is the \n     possibility of secret and sudden attack with chemical or \n     biological or radiological or nuclear weapons'' and on \n     September 30, 2004, President George W. Bush stated that \n     ``the biggest threat facing the country is weapons of mass \n     destruction in the hands of a terrorist network.''\n       (2) Protecting against nuclear, radiological, biological, \n     or chemical terrorism requires a layered defense drawing upon \n     a full spectrum of capabilities and tools, beginning with a \n     national strategy for a domestic and international effort to \n     detect, prevent, and respond to the proliferation of weapons \n     of mass destruction (WMD), or, if prevention fails, to manage \n     the consequences of attacks while preserving fundamental \n     liberties and economic activity.\n       (2) A National Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass \n     Destruction was published in December 2002.\n       (3) Since the development of the National Strategy--\n       (A) the nature of the weapons of mass destruction threats \n     to the United States has changed; and\n       (B) the understanding of likely future weapons of mass \n     destruction threats has also changed.\n       (4) Since the development of the National Strategy, United \n     States policies and capabilities for detecting, preventing, \n     and responding to weapons of mass destruction threats have \n     also changed:\n       (A) President George W. Bush enumerated on February 11, \n     2004, a number of new actions the United States would call \n     for to address weaknesses in efforts to combat the \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Some of the \n     most important of these actions have not yet been implemented \n     or have met international resistance.\n       (B) A significant intelligence failure has been identified \n     with respect to the assessment of the weapons of mass \n     destruction capabilities of Iraq, which failure has \n     precipitated several efforts to identify systemic \n     deficiencies in intelligence and implement recommended \n     improvements, including implementation of 70 recommendations \n     of the Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the \n     United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction.\n       (C) As required by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \n     Prevention Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-458), and as \n     recommended by the Commission on the Intelligence \n     Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass \n     Destruction, President George W. Bush announced in June 2005 \n     the intent to establish a National Counter Proliferation \n     Center (NCPC). The Center will exercise strategic oversight \n     of the work of the intelligence community on threats posed by \n     the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and will \n     play a unique leading role within the United States \n     Government in addressing such threats.\n       (D) A number of other significant changes to United States \n     policies and capabilities to combat the proliferation of \n     weapons of mass destruction have been recommended, and in \n     some cases, implemented since December 2002, in the absence \n     of an updated national strategy on combatting the \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n       (b) Update of National Strategy To Combat Weapons of Mass \n     Destruction.--(1) Not later than 6 months after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the President shall develop and \n     submit to Congress an update to the National Strategy to \n     Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction of December 2002.\n       (2) The update of the National Strategy shall take into \n     account developments since the publication of the National \n     Strategy in December 2002.\n       (3) The update of the National Strategy shall include the \n     following:\n       (A) Intelligence-based threat assessment.--An assessment of \n     the threat to United States territory, citizens, and \n     interests from the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction and the threat of terrorist acquisition and use \n     of weapons of mass destruction, which assessment should draw \n     upon, and be consistent with, the coordinated judgments of \n     the intelligence community.\n       (B) Objectives.--A statement of the objectives of United \n     States policy, both domestically and internationally, \n     regarding detection, prevention, and responding to the \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the threat \n     of terrorist acquisition (including through development or \n     theft) and use of weapons of mass destruction.\n       (C) Capabilities, roles, missions, concepts of \n     operations.--A statement of the full spectrum of currently-\n     available capabilities necessary, both domestically and \n     internationally, to address the proliferation of weapons of \n     mass destruction and the threat of terrorist acquisition and \n     use of weapons of mass destruction, and a statement of the \n     roles, missions, and concepts of operations for each of the \n     organizations and programs responsible for providing such \n     capabilities.\n       (D) Policy, program and operational coordination.--A review \n     of the mechanisms for planning, coordinating, and \n     implementing policy, programs, and operations, including \n     government-wide strategic operational planning, across all \n     agencies and entities undertaking work to combat the \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and to protect \n     the homeland against weapons of mass destruction attacks, and \n     a statement of plans for improving such mechanisms.\n       (4) The update of the National Strategy shall address \n     specific areas key to a successful national strategy to \n     combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \n     including, but not limited to the following:\n       (A) National counter proliferation center.--A description \n     of the roles, missions, and concepts of operations for the \n     National Counter Proliferation Center, including a plan and \n     schedule for establishing the Center and developing it to \n     full working capacity.\n       (B) International nonproliferation regimes.--A review of \n     how the United States will seek to strengthen the \n     international nonproliferation regimes, including, but not \n     limited to, the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and \n     associated entities (such as the Nuclear Suppliers Group) in \n     the wake of the 2005 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty review \n     conference, the Missile Technology Control Regime, the \n     Biological Weapons Convention, and the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention and associated entities (such as the Australia \n     Group).\n       (C) Security of nuclear materials.--A review of how the \n     United States plans to enhance programs to secure weapons-\n     usable nuclear materials and radiological materials suitable \n     for use in a so-called ``dirty bomb'' that are located around \n     the world, including but not limited to fulfilling \n     commitments made under the G-8 Global Partnership Against the \n     Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction.\n       (D) Detection and characterization capabilities.--A review \n     of how the United States plans to improve the array of \n     technologies and devices for the detection of weapons of mass \n     destruction to help ensure the homeland is protected from any \n     means by which weapons of mass destruction could be used \n     against the United States and to prevent the unauthorized \n     movement of such weapons.\n       (E) Interdiction capabilities.--An assessment of the \n     ability of the United States and the international community \n     to interdict in transit illicit equipment, technology, \n     materials, and personnel related to weapons of mass \n     destruction, including--\n       (i) an assessment of the date, type, number, and impact of \n     interdictions under the Proliferation Security Initiative and \n     any other similar initiatives or programs;\n       (ii) an assessment of whether and how the capabilities \n     under the Initiative, and any other similar initiatives or \n     programs, can be strengthened to achieve more concrete \n     results; and\n       (iii) an assessment of the amount of funding needed to \n     support such capabilities.\n       (F) Nuclear inspections and safeguards.--A review of how \n     the United States will seek to strengthen the ability of the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to monitor peaceful \n     nuclear energy programs to ensure that such programs are not \n     used as a cover for nuclear weapons development, including, \n     but not limited to--\n       (i) how the United States will encourage the adoption and \n     ratification by each non-nuclear weapon state of the Model \n     Additional Protocol with the Agency; and\n\n[[Page S8851]]\n\n       (ii) how the Executive Branch will implement the United \n     States Additional Protocol with the Agency in light of its \n     inability, thus far, to reach agreement on implementing \n     legislation that would permit United States ratification of \n     the Additional Protocol to which the United

   \n  SA 1487. Mr. REID submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by \nhim to the bill S. 1042, to authorize appropriations for fiscal year \n2006 for military activities of the Departmet of Defense, for military \nconstruction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, \nto prescribe personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed \nForces, and for other purposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; \nas follows:\n\n       At the end of division A, add the following:\n\n TITLE XV--NATIONAL COMMISSION ON THE FUTURE OF THE ALL-VOLUNTEER ARMY\n\n     SEC. 1501. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The war in Iraq and military operations in Afghanistan \n     and elsewhere around the world have put the regular Army, the \n     Army National Guard, and the Army Reserve under extreme \n     stress.\n       (2) There is a severe mismatch between the size of the \n     force and the missions that it is being asked to perform.\n       (3) The operational requirements of a sustained protracted \n     conflict, combined with the supply and demand mismatch, are \n     having a current negative and corrosive effect on the force, \n     which could worsen over time.\n       (4) The demands on the force are not likely to diminish in \n     the foreseeable future.\n       (5) 40 percent of the forces in Iraq are from the National \n     Guard or the Reserve.\n       (6) The severe stresses on the force are having an effect \n     on recruitment and retention for all components of the Army.\n       (7) The regular component of the Army could be thousands of \n     recruits short of its goal by the end of 2005, and the Army \n     National Guard and the Army Reserve could be even further \n     behind their recruiting goals by that time.\n       (8) Shortfalls in recruiting impose further stress on the \n     force, exacerbate recruiting and retention difficulties, and \n     put pressure on recruiters to use more aggressive tactics and \n     to lower standards.\n       (9) The stress is also seen in the day-to-day challenges \n     faced by military families confronting multiple and extended \n     tours of duty in combat operations abroad.\n       (10) Surveys of members of the National Guard and the \n     Reserve reveal that the combination of multiple and extended \n     tours with the resulting family burdens is the principle \n     reason for the decision of such members not to continue \n     service in the Army.\n       (11) Addressing size, resources, recruiting, retention, \n     military family quality of life, and others issues facing the \n     Army, the Army National Guard, and the Army Reserve is an \n     urgent national priority.\n       (12) These are admittedly very complex issues, and a \n     partisan inquiry into who is responsible for ``breaking the \n     force'' is not what is needed.\n       (13) Given the profound importance of these issues, a \n     bipartisan commission of prominent Americans should study \n     these issues and make recommendations to Congress on an \n     appropriate response to them.\n\n     SEC. 1502. ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--There is established the National \n     Commission on the Future of the All-Volunteer Army (in this \n     title referred to as the ``Commission'').\n       (b) Membership.--\n       (1) Composition.--The Commission shall be composed of eight \n     members of whom--\n       (A) two shall be appointed by the Majority Leader of the \n     Senate;\n       (B) two shall be appointed by the Minority Leader of the \n     Senate;\n       (C) two shall be appointed by the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives; and\n       (D) two shall be appointed by the Minority Leader of the \n     House of Representatives, from among the members of such \n     House.\n       (2) Date.--The appointments of the members of the \n     Commission shall be made not later than 90 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Period of Appointment; Vacancies.--Members shall be \n     appointed for the life of the Commission.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING DEPOT MAINTENANCE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Depot Maintenance Strategy and Master Plan of the \n     Air Force reflects the essential requirements for the Air \n     Force to maintain a ready and controlled source of organic \n     technical competence, thereby ensuring an effective and \n     timely response to national defense contingencies and \n     emergency requirements;\n       (2) since the publication of the Depot Maintenance Strategy \n     and Master Plan of the Air Force in 2002, the service has \n     made great progress toward modernizing all 3 of its Depots, \n     in order to maintain their status as ``world class'' \n     maintenance repair and overhaul operations;\n       (3) One of the indispensable components of the Depot \n     Maintenance Strategy and Master Plan of the Air Force is the \n     commitment of the Air Force to allocate $150,000,000 a year \n     over 6 years, beginning in fiscal year 2004, for \n     recapitalization and investment, including the procurement of \n     technologically advanced facilities and equipment, of our \n     Nation's 3 Air Force depots; and\n       (4) the funds expended to date have ensured that \n     transformation projects, such as the initial implementation \n     of ``Lean'' and ``Six Sigma'' production techniques, have \n     achieved great success in reducing the time necessary to \n     perform depot maintenance on aircraft.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Air Force should be commended for the \n     implementation of its Depot Maintenance Strategy and Master \n     Plan and, in particular, meeting its commitment to invest \n     $150,000,000 a year over 6 years, since fiscal year 2004, in \n     the Nation's 3 Air Force Depots; and\n       (2) the Air Force should continue to fully fund its \n     commitment of $150,000,000 a year through fiscal year 2009 in \n     investments and recapitalization projects pursuant to the \n     Depot Maintenance Strategy and Master Plan.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1510.

SENSE OF SENATE ON F/A-22 RAPTOR AIRCRAFT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) It is widely held that integrated air defense systems, \n     composed of next generation surface-to-air missiles and fifth \n     generation fighters, will be the primary threat to United \n     States dominance of the skies and the ability of the Nation \n     to access strategically important regions during future \n     conflicts.\n       (2) Many of the current tactical aircraft of the United \n     States first flew more than 30 years ago and several nations \n     have deployed integrated air defense systems designed to \n     counter these aircraft. These aircraft include the F-15 \n     Eagle, F-16 Fighting Falcon, and F/A-18 Hornet, none of which \n     are stealth aircraft.\n       (3) the F/A-22 Raptor aircraft is a highly-capable stealth \n     aircraft designed to neutralize both surface-to-air missiles \n     and fifth generation fighters.\n       (4) The F/A-22 Raptor aircraft is a truly transformational \n     aircraft incorporating--\n       (A) super-cruise engines that allow for extended supersonic \n     flight (a magnitude longer than its after-burner \n     predecessors);\n       (B) unmatched stealth capabilities; and\n       (C) a radar and avionics system that will permit the \n     identification of ground targets and engage enemy aircraft at \n     great ranges.\n       (5) The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is being designed as a \n     compliment to the F/A-22 Raptor aircraft, but the F-35 Joint \n     Strike Fighter will not be as stealthy the F/A-22 Raptor \n     aircraft, nor will it be able, due to design constraints, to \n     utilize super-cruise engines.\n       (6) The F/A-22 Raptor aircraft is the most maneuverable \n     fighter flying today, a matter of particular importance when \n     encountering newer Russian-made aircraft that have been sold \n     widely throughout the world and boast a highly impressive \n     maneuver capability.\n       (7) The F/A-22 Raptor aircraft is a capable bomber, with a \n     large weapons bay having the capacity to carry two 1,000 \n     pound Global Positioning System-guided Joint Direct Attack \n     Munitions or several Small Diameter Bombs.\n       (8) The National Defense Strategy calls for a force \n     structure that--\n       (A) defends the homeland;\n       (B) is capable of forward deterrence in four regions;\n       (C) can swiftly defeat adversaries in two overlapping \n     conflicts; and\n       (D) can decisively defeat an enemy in one of those \n     conflicts.\n       (9) The Air Force has repeatedly warned that, in order to \n     meet the requirements of the National Defense Strategy, the \n     service requires far more than the 180 F/A-22 Raptor aircraft \n     currently planned for procurement by the Department of \n     Defense.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the Secretary of Defense should review the decision \n     articulated in Program Budget Decision 753 to ensure that \n     sufficient numbers of F/A-22 Raptor aircraft are procured in \n     order meet applicable requirements in the National Defense \n     Strategy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1511.

COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY FOR SECURITY AND \n                   ACCOUNTABILITY OF WEAPONS-USABLE NUCLEAR \n                   MATERIAL IN THE FORMER SOVIET UNION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On September 30, 2004, President George W. Bush stated \n     that ``the biggest threat facing this country is weapons of \n     mass destruction in the hands of a terrorist network.''.\n       (2) In a joint statement with President of Russia Vladimir \n     Putin on February 24, 2005, President George W. Bush further \n     noted that ``[w]e bear a special responsibility for the \n     security of nuclear weapons and fissile material, in order to \n     ensure that there is no possibility such weapons or materials \n     would fall into terrorist hands.''.\n       (3) When the Soviet Union disintegrated, it left behind an \n     estimated 30,000 nuclear warheads, as well as sufficient \n     plutonium and highly enriched uranium to produce more than \n     40,000 additional weapons. Most of this material is not \n     secure and is therefore vulnerable to theft by potential \n     terrorists.\n       (4) In 1991, Congress adopted the Soviet Nuclear Threat \n     Reduction Act of 1991 (title II of Public Law 102-228; 22 \n     U.S.C. 2551 note; commonly referred to as ``Nunn-Lugar'') to \n     assist the Soviet Union and ``successor entities'' with \n     efforts to promptly and safely destroy its nuclear weapons \n     arsenal and secure its stockpiles of weapons-usable nuclear \n     materials.\n       (5) It is the stated goal of the Department of Energy to \n     complete comprehensive security and accountability upgrades \n     through programs under the Soviet Nuclear Threat Reduction \n     Act of 1991 for all of the former weapons-usable nuclear \n     material in the Soviet Union by 2008. However, after 13 years \n     of work, less than 50 percent of such nuclear materials and \n     warheads have received basic cooperative security upgrades, \n     and only 26 percent have received comprehensive upgrades.\n       (6) Acquiring fissile materials is the most difficult step \n     for terrorists seeking to build a nuclear weapon, and also \n     the easiest step for the United States and friendly nations \n     to stop, making control over fissile material the first and \n     best line of defense for preventing terrorist groups from \n     using nuclear weapons.\n       (7) It has now been nearly 10 years since Congress first \n     received testimony about the risk of theft of nuclear \n     material in the former Soviet Union.\n       (8) Statements by Osama bin Laden and other terrorist \n     leaders have made it clear that terrorists will stop at \n     nothing to obtain nuclear weapons material and capability.\n       (9) In February 2005 Porter Goss, Director of the Central \n     Intelligence Agency, testified that sufficient Russian \n     nuclear material was unaccounted for to enable terrorists to \n     build a nuclear weapon.\n       (10) The September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the \n     United States highlighted the importance of preventing \n     terrorists from obtaining nuclear weapons or materials, yet \n     the pace of progress toward that goal has decreased when \n     compared with the years immediately preceding those attacks.\n       (11) The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks on the \n     United States (September 11th Commission) concluded that a \n     ``maximum effort'' was required to keep nuclear weapons and \n     fissile material out of terrorist hands.\n       (12) Securing only a portion of the loose nuclear material \n     is insufficient because terrorists seeking nuclear weapons \n     materials will likely seek out the worst defended site.\n       (13) A new report published by the Project on Managing the \n     Atom of Harvard University, in conjunction with the Nuclear \n     Threat Initiative, entitled ``Securing the Bomb 2005'', \n     concluded that ``a dramatic acceleration will be needed to \n     meet [the Department of Energy's] stated goal of finishing \n     upgrades less than 4 years from now.''.\n       (14) In January 2001, a bipartisan task force chaired by \n     Howard Baker, former Majority Leader of the Senate and Lloyd \n     Butler, former White House counsel, concluded that ``the most \n     urgent, unmet national security threat to the United States \n     today is the danger that weapons of mass destruction or \n     weapons-usable material in Russia could be stolen and sold to \n     terrorists or hostile nation states and used against American \n     troops abroad or citizens at home,'' and recommended \n     investing $30,000,000,000 over 10 years on Department of \n     Energy programs to secure nuclear material. The pace of \n     spending since then on all nonproliferation and threat \n     reduction programs in the former Soviet Union has been only \n     about $1,000,000,000 per year.\n       (15) Many reports, including the report referred to in \n     paragraph (14), have called for a single, strategic plan to \n     secure nuclear material in the former Soviet Union, but none \n     has yet been produced.\n       (16) The urgency for this work is demonstrated by the fact \n     that customs officials in Russia reported 200 potential \n     attempts to smuggle nuclear or radiological materials out of \n     Russia in 2004.\n\n[[Page S8888]]\n\n       (17) While an increasing number of nuclear sites in Russia \n     have been secured, the remaining unsecured sites include \n     several very sensitive locations that hold vast stocks of \n     nuclear weapons and materials.\n       (18) Concentrated attention to these sensitive sites is \n     required, including an effort to increase the seriousness \n     with which the Government of Russia and the public in Russia \n     view the problem, in order to help overcome remaining issues \n     of access, liability, and allocation of Russian resources \n     which have long slowed progress on the objectives of the \n     Soviet Nuclear Threat Reduction Act of 1991.\n       (19) The horrific terrorist attack on schoolchildren in \n     Beslan may help to increase attention in Russia to problems \n     of terrorism, including nuclear terrorism, making United \n     States support for these efforts all the more crucial at this \n     time.\n       (20) Eliminating onerous certification requirements for \n     cooperative threat reduction programs with Russia, or \n     providing permanent authority to waive those requirements on \n     an annual basis, could significantly accelerate the pace of \n     efforts to secure loose nuclear material and warheads.\n       (21) Recent developments with the G-8 Global Partnership \n     and the Global Threat Reduction Initiative, as well as \n     funding increases included in the fiscal year 2006 budget \n     request, offer the potential for accelerated progress on this \n     crucial objective.\n       (22) Russia has become a valuable partner in the war on \n     terrorism and a full partner in efforts to secure nuclear \n     weapons and weapons-usable nuclear material and to destroy \n     strategic delivery systems, chemical weapons, and excess \n     nuclear warheads.\n       (b) Statement of United States Policy.--\n       (1) Statement of united states policy.--It shall be the \n     policy of the United States that the Department of Defense \n     and the Department of Energy shall seek to work with the \n     Government of Russia and governments of other states of the \n     former Soviet Union to complete comprehensive security and \n     accountability upgrades for all of the weapons-usable nuclear \n     material in the former Soviet Union by not later than \n     September 30, 2008, in accordance with the stated goal of the \n     Department of Energy.\n       (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the President should request, and Congress should \n     appropriate, the funds necessary to ensure that the policy \n     set forth in paragraph (1) is carried out.\n       (c) Strategy Required.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than the February 6, 2006, the \n     Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, and the \n     Secretary of Energy shall, in cooperation with the Director \n     of the Office of Management and Budget, jointly submit to \n     Congress a report setting forth a strategy for completing \n     comprehensive security and accountability upgrades for all of \n     the weapons-usable nuclear material in the former Soviet \n     Union by not later than September 30, 2008.\n       (2) Elements.--The report shall include, in addition to the \n     strategy--\n       (A) an assessment of the funding required to implement the \n     strategy; and\n       (B) a description of any legislative or administrative \n     actions required to facilitate implementation of the \n     strategy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1555.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 210, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 210) expressing sympathy for the \n     people of Egypt in the aftermath of the deadly terrorist \n     attacks on Sharm el-Sheik, Egypt, on July 23, 2005.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this evening the Senate will agree to a \nresolution expressing our condolences to the people of Egypt for the \ndeadly terrorist attacks that swept the resort of Sharm el-Sheik this \npast weekend.\n  Hundreds were injured, and probably when it is all over, more than \n100 will have died after terrorists detonated four large bombs in a \ncrowded hotel in this seaside resort.\n  Among the dead was an American, Kristina Miller, of Las Vegas, NV. \nKristina was a daughter of Nevada and a citizen of the world. A 1996 \ngraduate of Durango High School, Kristina was remembered by her friends \nas good-hearted, popular, and always adventurous.\n  She was in London on July 7 when the terrorists struck the mass \ntransit system of London. She survived those attacks unscathed and \ndecided to go to Egypt on vacation when these tragic attacks occurred \nat the resort she chose to go to.\n  Acts of terror, such as that which took her life, are a tragedy no \nmatter where they occur, but the loss of one of our own spreads \npersonal sadness across Nevada and the entire country. They also \ngenerate a sense of resolve and solidarity to hunt down and to bring to \njustice the thugs responsible for these heinous acts.\n  I am glad the Senate will speak with one voice in condemning these \nbarbaric acts, and I personally extend my deepest sympathy to the \nvictims, especially the family and friends of Kristina Miller.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.
