Mr. President, we will shortly begin this morning's \nsession with a rollcall vote on the adoption of the conference report \nto accompany the Agriculture appropriations bill. After that vote, we \nwill resume the deficit reduction reconciliation bill. All time expired \nlast night, and therefore we will begin a series of rollcall votes in \nrelation to the pending amendments. We will, in a few moments, enter \ninto an agreement which states the order for those votes. At this time, \nthere are approximately 16 pending amendments that we would need to \nvote on.\n  Following those votes, additional amendments may be offered, and \ntherefore the voting sequence would continue. This stacked series of \nvotes could be very lengthy, but we will continue voting until we \ncomplete the deficit reduction bill or up until 6 o'clock tonight. I \nhope and believe we can finish this afternoon, but that will depend on \nthe number of amendments and how many will be offered over the course \nof the so-called vote-arama that we will be in a little bit later \ntoday. We have asked Senators to remain in and around the Senate \nChamber over the course of the day to avoid missing any recorded votes. \nThese vote-aramas are very trying as the day goes on so I do wish to \nthank everybody in advance for their patience during what will be a \nvery busy session of voting today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/03/senate-section/article/S12285-7", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12285-S12286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND ANWR\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, over the past couple of weeks prices at the \npump have been steadily falling--thank goodness. After the shock of \npaying nearly $3, sometimes over, sometimes well over $3 a gallon, \nfamilies are finally getting some relief when they are filling up their \ncars or trucks, automobiles with gas. Gas prices are finally back to \npre-Katrina levels.\n  And that is the good news. The bad news is that prices are still much \nhigher than they were a year ago. Americans are paying significantly \nmore to fill up their cars, their automobiles with gas. And as we all \nknow with winter right around the corner, home heating costs threaten \nto literally break the family bank.\n  Meanwhile, America's oil companies are making multibillion dollar \nprofits, record profits. You could not miss the news last week that oil \ncompanies posted these record-breaking profits with one company posting \nthe biggest profit in U.S. history. So while Americans have been \nreeling from Katrina, standing in long lines at the pump at gas \nstations following Katrina and the other hurricanes and their cutting \nback on the necessities of everyday life, what they see are oil profits \nthat are booming, going off the chart. And we have constituents \nnaturally calling and writing and e-mailing saying, Why? How could that \npossibly be?\n  Literally, what they see is pumping gas and watching the little \nfigures come up higher and higher and higher, seeing money go out of \ntheir pocket and then going home and turning on the news and seeing \nthat the coffers of oil companies, that same money going into the gas \ntank almost being in the coffers of these large oil companies, and they \nare asking why.\n  I think these are legitimate questions, and Americans do have the \nright to know what is going on. Is this the way the market works and, \nif so, what are those dynamics? They need to know why those gas prices \nand those oil and natural gas prices are so much higher than they used \nto be at the same time these profits are off the chart.\n  That is why last week I asked Chairman Domenici and Chairman Stevens \nto hold a joint hearing to be able to answer those basic questions. \nNext week, several executives will be coming in from some of the \nbiggest oil companies to explain. We may well learn that there are no \nsinister reasons behind all\n\n[[Page S12286]]\n\nthis, but I think we all agree that our free market works best when we \nall know and we all follow the rules of the road and all have \nconfidence in that system.\n  That is what the focus of those hearings will be. If there are people \nabusing the free enterprise system to advantage themselves or their \nbusinesses at the expense of everyday Americans, they need to be \nexposed and they should be ashamed.\n  Next week's hearings will help shed light on this very important \nmatter.\n  Meanwhile, the Senate is also working to strengthen and secure \nAmerica's energy supply. Indeed, we are doing it, in part, in the bill \nthat we will be voting on over the course of today.\n  Last summer, the Senate passed a comprehensive energy plan that \nlooked, in terms of framework, at production, at consumption, at \nconservation, at alternative uses of fuel, at nuclear, at hydrogen, at \nthe investment of science and technology to make fuel use more \nefficient, and that was a good first step. But we have a lot more to \ndo.\n\n  When you go home and you are talking to constituents and you say: \nWhat if I told you that most of the oil that you are pumping into your \ngas tank comes from overseas, from foreign sources, from countries that \nare very specifically hostile to the United States, and what if I told \nyou that the United States has barely 45 days' worth of oil on hand in \nour own Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the answer is obvious. You would \nwant to diversify your energy sources, you would want to move toward \nenergy independence, and that is exactly what we need to do.\n  Now, if I told you that in the United States we have untapped oil \nreserves comparable to all of the oil in Arizona, California, Oregon, \nWashington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, North \nDakota, and South Dakota combined, you would want to find it since it \nis here and get it to the American people.\n  Well, we do have that resource. It is in Alaska under the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Reserve, ANWR. We all know ANWR is the Nation's \nsingle greatest prospect for future oil. The Government estimates that \nANWR contains approximately 10.4 billion barrels of technically \nrecoverable oil. At peak production at this one site could be produced \nmore oil than any other U.S. State, any other State in this country, \nTexas or Louisiana, from this one site.\n  In 1968, the Federal Government estimated that Prudhoe Bay held 9 \nbillion barrels of oil. To date, Prudhoe Bay has produced 13 billion \nbarrels and it is still producing. Now, more than ever, we need to \nrecognize the need to strengthen America's oil supply and now we have \nthe opportunity to do that. America can't afford $3 a gallon, and we \ncan't afford to depend on sources many of which are hostile to the \nUnited States.\n  Some critics complain that drilling in ANWR will hurt the \nenvironment. It is simply not true. It was stated again and again in \nthe Chamber yesterday and explained, the prospective drilling site is \nan area equivalent to the size, if you took a tennis court, of a single \npostage stamp.\n  State-of-the-art drilling technology has made remarkable advancements \nto preserve and protect the environment. It is now possible to extract \noil using that horizontal drilling technique from a site that could \nreach way out from a site that is very tiny, as you look at it on the \nhorizon or area. These are called extended reach wells. We talked \nyesterday about how far out you can go. You can go out horizontally \ntwice as far as you can vertically, therefore reducing the number of \ndrilling sites.\n  Developing the Reserve will create hundreds of thousands of jobs for \nhard-working Americans. It will contribute billions to the economy and \nstrengthen America's energy independence. The oil in ANWR is critical \nto our economic and national security. I look forward to the vote today \non developing this tremendous resource. Responsible, environmentally \nsensitive exploration will help ease the bottom line for every American \nfamily. We are working hard to deliver real solutions for the real \nproblems facing the American people by taking strong, decisive action. \nIndeed, by today's floor action, we are moving America forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/03/senate-section/article/S12286-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 2347 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I strongly oppose the Republican budget and \nthe package of reconciliation bills we will be debating and have \ndebated this past week. The Republican budget and the reconciliation \nbills are fiscally irresponsible and simply will increase the deficit, \nwhich is already staggering--$8 trillion.\n  The budget and these reconciliation bills are based on the wrong \nvalues. They harm vulnerable Americans. And these cuts simply provide \ntax breaks for special interests. With so many other serious problems \nfacing middle-class families and our Nation, the decision to focus on \nthis reconciliation legislation reflects seriously misplaced \npriorities. Certainly, together we can do better than this.\n  The budget of the United States ought to be a mirror of our Nation's \nvalues. The budget should reflect what we think is important, what we \ncare about and what we don't. It says a lot about who we are and what \nwe value as a people and a nation, this thing we call the budget.\n  In essence, a budget is a moral document. Unfortunately, the \nRepublican budget is an immoral document. That is not my term, Mr. \nPresident. That is the conclusion of some of our Nation's leading \nreligious leaders who, citing scripture and the Bible, have urged all \nof us to oppose this budget reconciliation process. As Bishop Mark \nHanson, the presiding bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in \nAmerica, put it, ``This is not the time to cut . . . important programs \nwhile using the cuts to pay for tax breaks for those who don't need \nthem.''\n  My Republican friends will portray their budget as a way to reduce \nthe deficit. In truth, their budget and these reconciliation bills \nactually make the deficit worse. In fact, debt under their budget would \ngo up by about $3 trillion in just 5 years. That is fiscally \nresponsible? No. It is irresponsible at any time but especially when we \nshould be saving to prepare for the baby boomers' retirement.\n  Let's review a little bit of the history. When this administration \ncame to power, our Nation had finally put our fiscal house in order. \nAfter many years of deficits and raids on Social Security to pay for \nother programs, Democrats, without the help of a single Republican \nvote, stopped that practice.\n  As a result of our efforts, this Nation ran a surplus from 1998 \nthrough 2001, and it was projected we would enjoy surpluses as far as \nthe eye could see. At the time, our future looked so bright that many \neconomists, including Alan Greenspan, seriously worried about what \nwould happen to financial markets if we eliminated our debt altogether. \nUnfortunately, in these 5 short years, with Washington Republicans in \ncontrol of the House, the Senate, and the White House, we have moved \nfrom a period of record surpluses to a time of record deficits. Once \nagain, we are raiding Social Security, and the deficits in each of the \nlast 3 years have been higher than at any time before President Bush \ntook office.\n  This year, Social Security has had taken from it--I don't know the \nexact amount--about $175 billion to mask the deficit. The latest \nRepublican budget before us will make matters even worse. While the \nmajority has divided its budget in a way that obscures its overall \neffect, nobody should be fooled.\n\n[[Page S12287]]\n\nViewed as a whole, budget reconciliation would increase the deficit by \nmore than $30 billion. After 5 years under their budget, our national \ndebt would exceed $11 trillion.\n  But the problems with their budget go well beyond its fiscal \nirresponsibility. This budget reflects the wrong values. It puts more \nburdens on those already struggling. And if that isn't bad enough, it \ntakes the sacrifices it demands of the less fortunate to partially pay \nfor another round of large tax breaks for the elite of this country.\n  Let's look at what is in the bill before us.\n  The budget increases burdens on America's seniors by increasing \nMedicare premiums, and we have not seen what the House is going to give \nus.\n  It cuts health care, both Medicare and Medicaid, by a total of $27 \nbillion.\n  It cuts support for our farmers by $3 billion.\n  It cuts housing.\n  It allows drilling in an Alaskan wildlife refuge, at the behest of \nthe oil and gas industry, even though this year they are going to make \na $100 billion profit.\n  If we take a look at what is happening in the House of \nRepresentatives, we can see what is likely coming down the pike from \nthem:\n\n       Student loan cuts, food stamp cuts, cuts in child support \n     enforcement, deeper and more painful cuts in health care.\n\n  Why? Why are we using expedited procedures for cuts that will harm \nmillions of seniors and working Americans? Is it to reduce the deficit \nor to pay for Katrina? No; no on both counts. Is it to prepare for the \navian flu? No. It is to provide congressional Republicans fiscal cover \ntoday so they can turn around tomorrow to provide tax breaks to special \ninterests and multimillionaires.\n  Let me be more specific. The capital gains and dividend tax breaks in \nthe Republican budget would provide 53 percent of its benefits to those \nwith incomes greater than $1 million. Those lucky few would get an \naverage tax break of about $35,000.\n  What about those with incomes between, say, $50,000 and $200,000? \nWell, they will get an average cut of $112. How about those with \nincomes of less than $50,000? Six dollars--$35,000 for those with \nincomes of more than $1 million, $6 for those earning less than \n$50,000. And to partially pay for these tax breaks, many Republicans \nnow want to cut Medicare, cut Medicaid, cut agriculture, cut housing, \ncut student loans, cut child support enforcement, cut services on which \nKatrina survivors should be relying, cut benefits needed by our \nNation's most vulnerable Americans.\n  Now you know why some of our Nation's most respected religious \nleaders call this budget immoral. These choices do not reflect the best \nof American values. That is not what Americans would want. America can \ndo better.\n  Finally, beyond the fiscal irresponsibility of this budget and the \ndisturbing choices it makes, there are other more important priorities \nthe Senate should be addressing. Take, for example, skyrocketing prices \nof fuel. Families are struggling to fuel their vehicles and heat their \nhomes. Farmers and businesses are feeling the pinch. Democrats have a \nplan to respond, to address price gouging, and ultimately make our \nNation energy independent. That is more important than harming the \nvulnerable to provide tax breaks to special interests while increasing \nthe deficit.\n  Hurricane survivors are still struggling. Thousands lack health care \ncoverage. More than 200,000 still live in motel and hotel rooms. \nDevastated communities have been forced into massive layoffs and are \nunable to provide even basic services, such as a place for kids to go \nto school. And many survivors who have lost everything are facing the \nthreats of foreclosure and bankruptcy in homes that do not even exist. \nDemocrats have a plan to address these urgent needs. That is more \nimportant than harming the vulnerable to provide tax breaks to special \ninterests and multimillionaires while increasing the deficit.\n  The Iraq war is not going well, as we all know. We were promised by \nthis administration that it would. Mr. President, 2,036 American \nsoldiers have been killed in Iraq. Tens of thousands have been wounded, \nbadly injured; 150,000 more are still in harm's way in Iraq, while the \nadministration still has no plan to end the conflict and bring them \nhome. Instead of being greeted as liberators, the violence continues \nnearly 3 years after the start of this conflict. Our Nation badly needs \na strategy for success, and that, too, is more important than harming \nthe vulnerable to provide tax breaks to special interests and \nmultimillionaires while increasing the deficit.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat this budget piece by piece. It is \nfiscally irresponsible. It is based on the wrong values and reflects \nthe wrong priorities. I would hope together we could do better. Let's \nreject this budget, and let's focus on the real needs of the middle \nclass and our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/03/senate-section/article/S12287-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12287-S12291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   APPROPRIATIONS FOR AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG \n    ADMINISTRATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING \n             SEPTEMBER 30, 2006--CONFERENCE REPORT--Resumed\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, while I recognize there are good things in \nthis bill, today I will be voting against the Agriculture \nappropriations conference report for two primary reasons. One, it \ndelays the implementation of the country- of-origin labeling for beef \nand other foods. U.S. consumers deserve to know where their food is \ngrown and processed, and domestic producers deserve the opportunity to \ndifferentiate their products from foreign imports. While mandatory \ncountry-of-origin food labeling passed as part of the 2002 farm law, \nits implementation continues to be delayed and this bill would delay it \nan additional 2 years.\n  My other primary concern is that the bill cuts funding for many \nimportant conservation programs, such as the Conservation Security \nProgram. Since the farm bill was enacted in 2002, the USDA conservation \nprograms have taken hits year after year. They have been used \nrepeatedly as a source of offsets to fund other needs. Including this \nconference report, the annual appropriations measures from fiscal year \n2003 through fiscal year 2006 have cut $1.13 billion in mandatory funds \nthat we dedicated to conservation in the farm bill.\n  I appreciate the hard work of the chairman and the ranking member, \nbut what came back from the House is not good for our Nation's farmers, \nit is not good for consumers, and it is not good for conservation. I \nwill, therefore, be voting against it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on the \nconference report to H.R. 2744, the Agriculture Appropriations bill for \nfiscal year 2006. Unfortunately, I cannot support final passage of this \nbill.\n  The conference agreement to H.R. 2744 appropriates about $100.9 \nbillion in spending, an amount that is approximately $848 million over \nthe administration's request, $258 million more than the Senate-\napproved bill and $660 million more than the House-passed bill. As is \nthe case with many of the appropriations bills that come to the floor, \nthis bill and its accompanying report contain earmarks and pork \nprojects which have not been authorized or requested.\n  I believe that some Federal involvement is necessary to assist low-\nincome families under the Food Stamp Program and that we ensure that \nour farmers stay out of the red. And to this end, many of the programs \nunder the Agriculture Department are worthwhile and I support their \nfunding. I know that many of my colleagues have spoken before the \nSenate about the economic struggles of America's farmers, but as \nCongress looks ahead towards legislating a new farm bill in the near \nfuture, we once again conform to the practice of diverting taxpayer \ndollars into an array of special interest pork projects.\n  Let's take a look at some of the earmarks that are in this bill: \n$350,000 for a report on the economic development of the sheep industry \nin the United States; $1,250,000 for the National Sheep Industry \nImprovement Center; $210,000 to the Little Red River Irrigation \nproject, Arkansas; $1,800,000 for the Muskingam River Watershed, \nMohican River, Jerome and Muddy Fork obstruction removal projects, \nOhio; $1,000,000 for a flood prevention project\n\n[[Page S12288]]\n\nin Kane County, Illinois; $200,000 for a grant to administer a private \nlands wildlife management program in Alaska; $1,000,000 for a grant to \nthe Ohio Livestock Expo Center in Springfield, OH; $2,250,000 for a \ngrant to the Wisconsin Federation of Cooperatives for pilot Wisconsin-\nMinnesota health care cooperative purchasing alliance; $200,000 for a \ngrant to the Utah State University for a farming and dairy training \ninitiative; and $500,000 for a grant to the Nueces County, Texas \nRegional Fairground.\n\n  It is a violation of Senate rules to legislate on an appropriations \nbill, and this fact is far too often overlooked. Authorizing policy is \na function reserved for the authorizing committees, not the \nappropriations committee. As is done far too frequently, this \nappropriations bill includes a variety of policy changes. Examples \ninclude:\n  The conference agreement authorizes the purchase of land by the \nAgriculture Research Service in Florence, SC.\n  The conference agreement authorizes the lease of 40 acres of Federal \nARS land to the Colorado State University system.\n  The conference agreement authorizes the ARS to convey 19 acres of \nFederal land to Oktibbeha County, MS.\n  The conference agreement allows for the granting of easements at the \nBeltsville, MD, Agricultural Research Center.\n  The conference agreement amends the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 \nregarding Federal loans.\n  The conference agreement amends the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n  The conference agreement amends the Organic Food Production Act of \n1990.\n  The conference agreement amends the Federal Meat Inspection Act.\n  The statement of managers that accompanies this conference report \nalso includes hundreds of earmarks and questionable projects. Here are \nsome examples: $300,000 for beaver management in North Carolina; \n$625,000 for game bird predation work with the University of Georgia; \n$50,000 for control of feral hogs in Missouri; $50,000 for animal \ntracking projects in the State of Washington; $380,000 to continue \ncontrol measures for minimizing blackbird damage to sunflowers in North \nDakota and South Dakota; $196,000 for geese control in the State of New \nYork; $75,000 for research into peanut production, Dawson, GA; $75,000 \nfor research into seafood waste, Fairbanks, AK; and $250,000 for turf \ngrass research, Beaver, WV.\n  Despite high gas prices, despite a swelling budget deficit, despite \nour military operations overseas, and despite our domestic emergencies, \npork continues to thrive in good times and bad. The cumulative effect \nof these earmarks erode the integrity of the appropriations process \nand, by extension, our responsibility to the taxpayers. We can do \nbetter for our farmers and the American people.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I voted to reject the conference \ncommittee's report on the fiscal year 2006 Agriculture appropriations \nbill. There is much about this bill that I support. It funds important \nresearch in North Dakota and across the country that will greatly \nbenefit American agriculture.\n  I voted against the conference report because of how it treats an \nimportant issue called country-of-origin labeling. The 2002 farm bill \nrequired that fruits, vegetables, seafood, and meat sold in grocery \nstores and supermarkets be labeled with its country of origin. This is \na consumer-friendly, farmer-friendly, rancher-friendly law, and I \nstrongly supported it. After all, if we can look at a label on our T-\nshirt and know where it came from, we should be able to do the same \nwith the T-bone steak on our dinner plate.\n  Country-of-origin labeling, or COOL, was supposed to begin in \nSeptember 2004. If we had followed the law we passed in the farm bill, \nAmerican consumers would today be able to know where their food comes \nfrom, and our farmers and ranchers would be reaping the benefits. \nUnfortunately, 2 years ago, opponents of this commonsense law hid a \nprovision in a massive spending bill that delayed the start date for \nCOOL until 2006.\n  COOL is the law of the land. The Senate has voted overwhelmingly in \nfavor of it. It should have gone into effect years ago. So I was \noutraged to learn there was another 2-year delay of COOL in this year's \nAgriculture Appropriations bill.\n  I knew some opponents of COOL wanted to delay this important program. \nBut I expected that when the conference committee met to write a final \nversion of the Agriculture appropriations bill, we would get a chance \nto debate this issue and vote on it, in public. Instead, a handful of \nRepublican Senators and Representatives went behind closed doors and \ndecided on their own to delay the program for an additional 2 years.\n  That is an outrage. I voted no today because I think we should send \nthis bill back to the conference committee and force the conference \ncommittee to vote on this issue.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today I discuss the Agricultural \nAppropriations conference report, which recently passed the Senate. \nThough I was not pleased with all aspects of the final report, I voted \nin favor of this bill because I support New York farmers and consumers.\n  I am proud to support the increases made to the Food Stamp Program, \nwhich is vital to feeding New York families and children.\n  The Food Stamp Program plays a critical role in fighting hunger and \nameliorating poverty in both our urban and rural communities. This \nprogram provides critical resources to millions of low-income families \nwith children, seniors and individuals with disabilities.\n  In addition, hundreds of thousands of displaced evacuees are \ncurrently in need of critical food assistance due to Hurricanes Katrina \nand Rita. As the Nation works to recover and rebuild from these \ndevastating natural disasters, the widespread need for increased \nassistance demands that Federal Government food relief efforts be \nexpanded, not cut.\n  I also welcomed increased funding to child nutrition programs, though \nI was upset to see that New York State was not included in the USDA's \nFruit and Vegetable Program this year. I will continue to work with my \nSenate colleagues on the Agriculture Committee to ensure that New York \nis added next year. New York children deserve to have access to fresh \nproduce in their lunch lines and in their schools.\n  These positive aspects of the bill won my support for the bill as a \nwhole. However, the bill has several important flaws that I must make \nnote of. I am dismayed by the decision to cut funds to the Conservation \nSecurity Program, CSP, which provides voluntary incentives for farmers \nand ranchers to participate in efforts to preserve and enhance their \nfarmland, their natural resources and the environment.\n  Five watersheds in New York State are currently eligible for CSP sign \nup in FY 2005--Ausable, Northern and Southern Long Island, Buffalo and \nNiagara--and about 2,860 farms and over 436,000 acres are enrolled. Two \nadditional New York State watersheds have been proposed to be added to \nCSP for FY 2006--East Branch Delaware and Oak Orchard--which would add \nan estimated 1,800 new farms and almost 390,000 acres to the program. \nDue to the drastic nature of the cuts to the Conservation Security \nProgram, these contracts to New York State farmers are in jeopardy.\n  I am also extremely disappointed by several of the provisions that \nwere included in the conference report, particularly the decision to \nonce again delay mandatory country-of-origin labeling. This provision \nwas inserted behind closed doors and does not serve the interests of \nproducers and consumers in my state of New York.\n  The 2002 farm bill required that the U.S. Department of Agriculture \nwrite rules and implement mandatory country-of-origin labeling, COOL, \nof meat products, seafood, fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables, and \npeanuts by September 2004.\n  My producers want mandatory COOL because it will give them a \ncompetitive advantage over foreign goods, particularly for the fresh \nmarket specialty crops that New York produces. It is also good for \nconsumers, who will be able to make an informed choice and buy food \nproduced closer to home. In addition, mandatory COOL will enhance food \nsafety through increased traceability of our food products and will \nbetter protect animal and human health.\n\n[[Page S12289]]\n\n  Despite practical suggestions from small farmers and ranchers for \nstreamlining the country-of-origin labeling process, I am disheartened \nto see that the decision has instead been made by agribusiness, which \ndoesn't want consumers to know where food comes from.\n  While I voted for this bill because I feel that it is imperative to \nkeep agriculture and nutrition programs moving forward, I hope to \ncontinue to work with my Senate colleagues to address some of the \nshortcomings in the future.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr President, the fiscal year 2006 Agriculture \nappropriations conference report was written under some very difficult \nspending constraints compared to the needs of U.S. agriculture. Because \nthe bill contains many positive elements for North Dakota agriculture, \nI intend to vote for its passage. However, I am deeply concerned that \nthe appropriators have again adopted a delay in the implementation of \nthe mandatory country-of-origin labeling for U.S. agricultural \nproducts. This provision is broadly supported by U.S. farmers and \nlivestock producers who wish to be able to differentiate their products \nin the marketplace. It is also supported by our consumers who desire to \nknow where their food is produced. It is unfortunate the conference \nfailed to represent those interests.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the fiscal year \n2006 Agriculture appropriations bill. I want to thank Chairman Bennett \nand Ranking Member Kohl for their long, hard work on this important \nbill. In the current fiscal environment, it is extremely difficult to \nput together an Agriculture appropriations bill that meets the needs of \nrural communities across the U.S., and I believe that Senators Bennett \nand Kohl have done an admirable job.\n  I am very pleased that two of my amendments that were adopted during \nSenate consideration of this bill were included in the final conference \nreport--specifically, my first amendment will result in a thorough \nreview of the impact the increased cost of gas, natural gas, and diesel \nis having on farmers, ranchers, and rural communities; and my second \namendment will help to address ongoing bark beetle infestation \nproblems.\n  In addition, I am pleased that Colorado State University will receive \nfunding for several important agricultural research programs such as \ninfectious disease research, Russian wheat aphid research, and beef \ncattle genetics research.\n  Unfortunately, I am still concerned about the rural communities this \nconference report is primarily designed to assist. I am concerned that \nwe are not doing everything we can on behalf of those farmers, ranchers \nand agri-businesses that continue to play a vital role in our Nation's \nrural communities. We are not making the necessary investments to keep \nour young people in these communities, and we are not making the \nnecessary investments in research and development that will allow those \ncommunities to compete economically.\n  I am also concerned that this bill includes yet another delay for \ncountry-of-origin labeling. I believe this is a commonsense provision \nthat will provide American consumers with information about where their \nfood is coming from--information they need and deserve. Common sense \ndictates that if we can label where our shirts and socks are made, we \ncan surely label where our meat and other kinds of food come from. I \nwas disappointed to see this provision in the conference report, one \nthat I believe will prevent our consumers from receiving the \ninformation they need to make an informed choice--the choice to buy \nAmerican meat.\n  We can do more. Here is what I am hearing from my State: During \nharvest, agricultural producers are some of the largest fuel consumers \nin the U.S., and producers are facing enormous fuel costs. In Grand \nJunction, CO, diesel prices are over $3.00.\n  I have heard from one Colorado farmer in Kit Carson County who has \nestimated that, in order to harvest this year, he will need an \nadditional $46,000 to cover fuel costs alone.\n  I have also heard from a farmer in northeastern Colorado who, in \norder to cover the increasing price of fuel, has applied for additional \nloans at his bank--only to be turned down because he is already \noverextended with existing loans.\n  That is why I am so pleased this bill now includes my amendment to \nrequire the Secretary of Agriculture to work with the Secretary of \nEnergy to produce a comprehensive report on the impact of high gas \nprices on our farmers, ranchers, and rural communities across the \ncountry. That data is the first step toward a comprehensive solution \nthat will help these communities address these terrible prices.\n  When you consider that these increasing fuel costs come on top of \nboth natural disasters and an overall budget picture that has resulted \nin $3 billion worth of cuts to important agricultural programs, it is \npainfully clear that we must do more to help our producers. I believe \nwe must cooperate to provide our rural residents with increased rural \ndevelopment and sustainable agricultural opportunities as well as \nreasonable commodity supports and eligibility guidelines to ensure that \nFederal supports go to the family farmers who are the intended \nbeneficiaries.\n  Our family farmers, ranchers, and rural business people deserve fair \nfarm, rural development, and conservation programs. They also deserve a \nsafe food supply and other policies that help create more successful \ncommunities. I will support this bill, which is a step in the right \ndirection. However, I do so with the recognition that it is not the \nwhole answer, and that we must continue to fight--fight for the \nimportant investments that will assure our rural communities that we \nhave not forgotten them.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to a vote on the adoption of the conference report to accompany \nH.R. 2744.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. They have not.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in September I was pleased to support \nthe Senate version of H.R. 2744, the fiscal year 2006 appropriations \nbill providing funding for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Drug \nAdministration, and related agencies. I want to thank Senators Bennett \nand Kohl for their hard work in crafting that legislation. While I may \nnot have supported every provision, on balance, the Senate bill \nprovided important funding to support our Nation's farmers, rural \ncommunities, and conservation programs and to provide nutritious food \nfor seniors, children, and those in need. While I still support many of \nthe provisions that remained in the conference report, there were \nsignificant changes and new provisions added that prevent me from \nsupporting the final conference report.\n  After years of delay, I was encouraged that the Senate bill included \nfunds to implement mandatory country-of-origin labeling, COOL, for \nmeat, vegetables, and fruits. Unfortunately the conference report \ndelays COOL for another 2 years, which is unacceptable for a provision \nthat was part of the 2002 farm bill. Country-of-origin labeling is \nvitally important to enable our farmers to show their pride in the \nquality of their products, from ginseng to cheese to cranberries. \nWisconsin farmers are proud of their work, and many consumers want to \nsupport American products--with country-of-origin labeling, both \nfarmers and consumers benefit.\n  The strength of the organic certification and labeling program \nthrough USDA has been the ability of organic consumers, farmers, \nprocessors, and retailers to work together to create a seal that \neveryone has confidence in. The Harvey court decision challenged some \nof the procedures in place for organic farming and food processing. \nThis situation should have caused the organic community to again come \ntogether, openly discuss the issues, and more than likely propose \nconsensus changes to the law to both ensure the reputation of the \norganic label and allow for the continued record growth of the organic \nmarket. The Senate had included an amendment to require the USDA to \nreport on the effects of the Harvey decision as part of this open \nprocess.\n\n[[Page S12290]]\n\n  Unfortunately, some powerful corporate interests who see organic \nfoods simply through the lens of potential profit were able to have \nlanguage inserted in conference. While some of the inserted changes \nmight ultimately have been adopted after open discussions with \ninterested parties, back-room deals in the dead of night are not the \nway to go and have the potential for undermining confidence in the \nentire organic program.\n  This closed-door process extended to other provisions that were \nchanged in conference to the detriment of the final report, including \nreductions in conservation funding and the removal of a provision \nproposed by Senator Harkin that would have prevented the privatization \nof food stamp offices.\n  I am also disappointed that there are not stronger protections \nagainst the politicization of decisions made by the Food and Drug \nAdministration. There is no room for politics in science, yet the FDA \nhas demonstrated an alarming indifference to scientific integrity in \nits unprecedented decision preventing emergency contraception, or Plan \nB, from being offered over the counter. I strongly believe women should \nhave access to all available contraceptive methods so that they can \nmake choices regarding their personal health. I have supported \nscientific integrity in the past, and I must express my displeasure \nthat stronger language was not included in the final conference report \nto prevent the FDA from allowing politics to affect its decision \nmaking.\n  By highlighting the problems with the conference report's process and \npolicy I don't mean to suggest that nothing good remains from the \nSenate bill. The conference report still rejects a number of \nadministration proposals to reduce or eliminate important programs such \nas funds for research at our land-grant colleges and universities, \nconservation partnerships through resource conservation and development \ncouncils, and funds to combat Johne's disease in our dairy industry. I \nwas also heartened that the conferees included critical funds to \naddress chronic wasting disease, and an amendment I proposed with \nSenator Allard to speed USDA's development of uniform regulations \ngoverning captive deer and elk. But, on balance, I simply cannot \nsupport the detrimental changes made in conference to the Senate bill.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as a member of the Agriculture \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I rise today to speak in support of the \nAgriculture appropriations conference report.\n  I would particularly like to thank the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Subcommittee, Senators Bennett and Kohl, for including $7 million \nin the bill for specialty crop funding.\n  Americans tend to forget that California is the largest agricultural \nproducing State in the Nation. Of the top 10 agricultural producing \ncounties nationwide, 8 are located in California. We export more crops \nthan any other State, and I am proud to say that 97 percent of our \nfarms are family owned.\n  As a result, I supported the Specialty Crop Competitiveness Act, \nlegislation to boost the marketing of highly nutritious fruits, \nvegetables and other specialty crops to American consumers and \ninternational markets. The legislation provided, for the first time, a \ndedicated source of funding to promote the marketing of specialty crop \nproducts.\n  Specialty crops are fruits and vegetables, tree nuts, dried fruits, \nand nursery crops, including floriculture. Farms in the Golden State \nproduce more than half of the Nation's fruits, vegetables and nuts from \njust 3 percent of the Nation's farmland. While California accounts for \nabout 13 percent of national cash receipts from agriculture, it \nreceives only about 3 percent of direct government payments to \nagriculture. These funds, while open to all 50 States, will help \nCalifornia specialty crop farmers.\n  As the globalization of markets continues, it is becoming \nincreasingly difficult for United States producers to compete against \nheavily subsidized foreign producers in both the domestic and foreign \nmarkets. United States specialty crop producers also continue to face \nserious tariff and nontariff trade barriers in many export markets. The \nfunding for specialty crops will promote the marketing of specialty \ncrops and improve access to foreign markets and competitiveness.\n  I am extremely pleased that we were able to include $7 million for \ncrops that are so vital to our Nation's food supply.\n  In addition, I would like to thank the chairman and ranking member \nfor including other projects that will benefit California.\n  They include: $1.35 million for the California County Pest Detection \nAugmentation Program. These funds will help California counties \nincrease high-risk pest exclusion inspection activities of new \nshipments of plants, seeds, fruits, vegetables, and animals. Pest \nexclusion is critical to a successful agricultural industry because it \nis more effective and less costly to prevent the introduction and \nestablishment of potentially harmful exotic pests from the local \nenvironment than it is to eliminate them;\n  $24.25 million for the Glassy-winged Sharpshooter/Pierce's Disease \nControl Program. The glassy-winged sharpshooter is an invasive pest \nthat spreads bacteria that kills grapes, almonds and tree fruits. This \nfunding will be used to develop the resources to eliminate the spread \nof the disease;\n  $200 million for the Market Access Program. This nationwide program \nprovides funding to promote the export of American agricultural \nproducts;\n  $1.929 million for Exotic Pest Disease Research at the University of \nCalifornia. The Exotic Pest and Disease Research Program funds research \nto combat a wide variety of exotic organisms that have invaded or could \ninvade California. Recent successes in the program include determining \nthe origin of avocado thrips found in Ventura and Orange counties--\ncausing an $8.7 million annual loss to growers--and identifying natural \nenemies to control the thrips and replace pesticides previously in use. \nA similar approach is being developed for the Avocado Lace Bug. In \naddition, the program has funded work on such organisms as Sudden Oak \nDeath, red imported fire ant, and Mediterranean fruitfly;\n  $20 million for the Farmers' Market Nutrition Program. The program \nprovides nutritional information and supplements as well as healthcare \nreferrals to low-income mothers and pregnant women. The Farmers Market \nNutrition Program provides coupons to participants to use to buy \nproduce from small farmers, and nutrition information is provided \nthrough the local Farmers Market Nutrition Program agency;\n  $3.076 million for the Sudden Oak Death Control Program. Funding will \nbe used to continue researching Sudden Oak Death Disease, which infects \nand destroys oak and tanoak trees;\n  $401,000 for Ozone Air Quality Research by the San Joaquin Valleywide \nAir Pollution Study Agency. A multi-year, intensive air quality study \nis needed to meet the requirements of Regional Haze State \nImplementation Plans anticipated after 2008. This study would build \nupon the Central California Ozone Study and the California Regional Air \nQuality Study. These new studies will include an ozone filed study, \ndata analysis, modeling performance evaluations, air quality and \nmeteorological modeling improvements, and a retrospective look at \nprevious State Implementation Plan modeling.\n  This bill is extremely important to ensuring a safe and secure \ndomestic food supply. I would like to again thank the chairman and the \nranking member for all of their hard work on this bill.\n  The question is on agreeing to the conference report. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

It is now in order to consider the Conrad \namendment. There is 2 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Biden \nbe added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the best argument made for my amendment, \nwhich is to restore fiscal responsibility, is the argument made by the \nchairman of the Budget Committee in 2002. Here is what he said:\n\n       The second budget discipline, which is pay-go, essentially \n     says if you are going to add a new entitlement program, or \n     you are going to cut taxes, you must offset that event so \n     that it becomes a budget neutral event. If we don't do this, \n     if we don't put back in place caps and pay-go, we will have \n     no budget discipline, and as a result we will dramatically \n     aggravate the deficit, which, of course, impacts a lot of \n     important issues but especially impacts Social Security.\n\n  The budget chairman was right then. It is the right position now. \nSupport the restoration of the budget discipline of pay-go.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I was correct then, and that is why we put \npay-go into this resolution. The budget resolution does have pay-go in \nit, and it is the appropriate approach to pay-go because it recognizes \nthere is a difference between tax relief and raising spending. The \nother side of the aisle has always looked on people's taxes as their \nmoney. We don't look at it that way on this side of the aisle. We look \nat it as the people's money, and they should be able to keep it. We \nshould not have a rule that arbitrarily takes it from them.\n  For that reason, I oppose the amendment.\n  I make a point of order that the pending amendment is not germane \nbefore the Senate, and I raise a point of order under section 305 of \nthe Budget Act.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsection of the act for the consideration of the pending amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays, and I ask my colleagues to support this \nbudget discipline.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 50, the nays are \n49. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Madam President, I rise today to speak in favor of fiscal \nresponsibility. This pay-go amendment introduced by Ranking Member \nConrad of the Budget Committee, of which I am a cosponsor, seeks to \nfully reinstate the pay-as-you-go requirement for direct spending and \nrevenue legislation in the Senate through 2010.\n  This is about restoring responsible budgeting. Previously, pay-go \nrules applied equally to increases in mandatory spending and decreases \nin revenue. New spending or tax cuts could only become law if they were \noffset or found 60 votes in support. This enforced a badly needed \nbudget discipline. It said, either pay for your priorities whether \nentitlement spending or tax cuts or both or find a supermajority of \ncolleagues willing to override the rule. Simple logic. Simple balance. \nCommon sense. Pay-go worked well in the 1990s to reduce deficits and it \ncan work well today.\n  Unfortunately, the rules were changed, and the balance was \noverturned. Now, the requirements of budget discipline apply to only \nhalf of the budget. Tax breaks are exempt from the logic and balance \nand common sense of budget discipline.\n  The problem is that there is no such thing as half a budget. Budget \ndiscipline requires enforcing control over both sides of the ledger. \nYou can't fill a bath tub just by plugging the drain. You can't drive a \ncar just by pressing on the brakes.\n  The original pay-go rules were abandoned to provide for a series of \nunfunded tax breaks. And since the tax breaks were unfunded, the \nGovernment had to borrow money to pay for them. So we borrowed from \ncountries like Japan and China. And we borrowed from the Social \nSecurity trust fund. In the process, our national debt shot up to $8 \ntrillion, and it is still rising. Last year, for example, our national \ncommitments exceeded our national resources by more than $550 billion. \nAnd we continue to borrow.\n  Some have argued that this first chapter of reconciliation is an \neffort to reduce the deficit. They tout the reductions in spending, \nmany of which I would support. But later this month, the Senate will \nget to chapter two of reconciliation, which proposes further unfunded \ntax breaks and guarantees additional deficits and growing debt. So much \ndebt, in fact, that the third chapter of budget reconciliation, which \nno one really wants to talk about, will involve raising our country's \ndebt ceiling to almost $9 trillion.\n  Americans deserve better financial leadership. The people I talk to \nin Illinois are not fooled by what is going on. They know what is \nhappening with higher deficits and reduced levels of government \nservice. They understand that, in this life, you get what you pay for \nand if you don't pay for it today, it will cost you more tomorrow.\n  Washington could learn a lot from the American people about fiscal \nresponsibility. The people I have met with know that if you need to \nspend more money on something, you also\n\n[[Page S12292]]\n\nneed to make more money, and if your income falls, your spending must \nfall, too. This is the essence of the pay-go rules we are trying to \nreinstate in the Senate. Changes in spending must be offset by changes \nin revenue, and vice versa.\n  Americans know that when you are already deep in debt, it is not the \noptimal time to be gutting your revenue stream, whether it's a few \nhundred dollars in the case of a family or a $70 billion tax break in \nthe case of the Federal Government.\n  They also understand the difference between a home mortgage, a \nstudent loan, a credit card debt for uninsured health care expenses, \nand an unpaid tab at the bar. They know that some debts are good \ninvestments or may be unavoidable. But some debts are irresponsible the \nresult of spending more than you can afford on purchases you could \npostpone or do without.\n  The people I have met with know that you do not respond to \nemergencies by indiscriminately cutting all parts of the family budget. \nYou make choices and forego luxuries before cutting back on essentials \nlike food, heating, education, and healthcare. They understand that \nacross the board cuts are neither fair nor responsible. Such cuts sound \nbold, but they represent a lack of leadership, not an example of it.\n  The American people also know that the whole family must share in \nsacrifice--it is not right to pick on any one member of the family, or \nany one State in our Union. We are in this together. Singling out \nAlaska's bridge projects or any one State's earmarked funds is the \nwrong approach. If Congress is going to eliminate frivolous pork \nprojects, as we should to support the gulf coast, let's eliminate all \nof them, in all States, together.\n  Finally, the people I talk to understand that when you have massive \ncosts coming down the road, you need to prepare for them. There is no \nexcuse for ignoring the financial consequences of foreseeable expenses \nwhether it is the rising costs of health care, the retirement of the \nbaby boom generation, or the growing inequality of wealth in our \nsociety.\n  You don't have to be a deficit hawk to be disturbed by the growing \ngap between revenues and expenses. This makes sense to people because \nthe same principles that apply to our national budget apply to their \nfamily budgets as well. Americans are willing to share in the hard \nchoices required to get us back on track, as long as they know that \neveryone is pulling their weight and doing their fair share.\n  That is why it is so important that we reinstate pay-go in a way that \nmeaningfully enforces the budget discipline both sides of the aisle \nneed to honestly tackle our short-term and long-term fiscal challenges.\n  Mr. President, it is time for fiscal responsibility to return to \nWashington. Adult supervision must return to the budgeting process.\n  Pay-go provides a necessary tool at a necessary time. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2352, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At this time there is 2 minutes on the Enzi \namendment.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I will yield to Senator Enzi.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senate is not in order. The Senator deserves a chance \nto be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, at the end of 2 minutes, that time being \nexpired, I intend to send a second-degree amendment to the Enzi \namendment to the desk. Let me briefly describe it. My amendment \naddresses the concerns of the Orthodox Union, the Catholic Bishops, and \nthe Council on American Private Education. My amendment clearly \nestablishes an indirect aid program for displaced private school \nstudents that meets all the constitutional requirements without placing \nunworkable and unnecessary restrictions on private schools serving \nthese displaced families. It ensures accountability for the funds and, \nmost important, delivers on the much-needed relief to ensure the \nrestart and operation of schools at all levels in the affected areas.\n  The 2002 Zellman decision by the Supreme Court clarified that \nreligious schools which accept Government funding do not have to modify \ntheir teachings and curricula in order to receive Government funding so \nlong as the Government aid arrives at the school by virtue of an \nindependent choice made by the student and parent, and this amendment \ncomplies with that decision and meets all of its constitutional \nrequirements.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I hate to debate a second-degree amendment that has not yet \nbeen sent to the desk.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Could we have order, Madam President.\n  Mr. ENZI. At the appropriate point in time I will be raising the \npoint of germaneness. This amendment shows the Gordian knot we are \ntrying to cut through so we can do the right things for the children of \nKatrina.\n  What we have is constitutional. We are not trying, in the amendment \nthat will be up as the original amendment, to resolve vouchers. We are \nnot trying to resolve faith-based initiatives. What we are trying to do \nis do the right thing to treat the kids of Katrina the right way, and \nin order to solve this it has to be a very bipartisan way because we \nalso will have to overcome a point of germaneness.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Kennedy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, we should not penalize the children of \nLouisiana and the gulf, once by the storm and once by this amendment. \nThis amendment does not have accountability. It allows Federal funds to \nbe used for religious purposes. It guts the civil rights protections of \nour proposal.\n  For the sake of the children and for the sake of the schools, I hope \nthis amendment will be defeated.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 2404 to Amendment No. 2352, as Modified\n\n (Purpose: To provide assistance for elementary and secondary schools \n    and students, and institutions of higher education, affected by \n                           Hurricane Katrina)\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I send a second-degree amendment to the Enzi amendment to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign] proposes amendment No. \n     2404 to amendment No. 2352, as modified.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. ENZI. The pending amendment is not germane to the measure now \nbefore the Senate. I raise a point of order under section 305 of the \nBudget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Pursuant to section 904(c) of the Congressional Budget \nAct of 1974, I move to waive section 305 of the Budget Act for the \nconsideration of the Ensign second-degree amendment. I ask for the yeas \nand nays on the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, as I understand it, and I am not sure I \nunderstand it, I believe there is now still 2 minutes of debate \navailable between the proponent of the second degree and the proponent \nin opposition. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. I presume Senator Enzi and Senator Ensign can continue \ntheir discussion.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Is this the total time? I thought we had a minute on each side on \neach amendment. Are we now debating the Enzi underlying amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes on the second-degree \namendment, the Ensign amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry. And I ask \nunanimous consent that this time not be applied to the time relative to \nthe debate that is available.\n\n[[Page S12293]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. As I understand the situation, the 2 minutes of debate has \nalready occurred on the Enzi amendment. We are now under 2 minutes of \ndebate on the second-degree amendment, which is the Ensign amendment. \nIs that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. After this amendment is debated, there will be a vote on \nthe motion to waive the point of order made by Senator Enzi from \nWyoming, the motion to waive being made by Senator Ensign relative to \nthe second-degree amendment. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Parliamentary inquiry, Madam President: I thought we \nwere having the 2 minutes prior to each vote just over the course of \nthe day on these different amendments. It is my mistake because I \nthought we were just voting on the Ensign amendment, and then, when we \ndisposed of that, we would have a vote up or down on the underlying \namendment. But I guess that is not the way we are going to proceed.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, if I may respond to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I say to the Senator from Massachusetts, \nbecause there was a second degree, the way it worked out, the debate on \nthe Enzi amendment occurred as part of that process. So the 2 minutes \ndid occur. However, because this is the first exercise here in this \nundertaking, I would suggest that, after the Ensign amendment is \ndisposed of, if it is favorably disposed of, that there won't be 2 \nminutes, but if it is not favorably disposed of we would have another 2 \nminutes of debate on the Enzi amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the chairman of the Budget Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, to clarify this, why would we have the \ndebate on the overlying motion before we have the debate on the \nunderlying motion and then try to deny a debate on the overlying motion \nat the appropriate time?\n  I would ask the chairman and the ranking member to consider this \nprocess. It will save a lot of time if the person suggesting a second-\ndegree amendment do the debate on the second-degree amendment. Did \nanybody here hear the debate on the first-degree amendment? That was \ndebate on the second-degree amendment.\n  So we disposed with the debate on the second-degree amendment. Now we \nought to have the vote on the second-degree amendment, not another \ndebate on the second-degree amendment and then go to the first-degree \namendment without debate--or even with debate.\n  If we are going to limit the time, we need to limit the time each \ntime. And if somebody is going to do a second-degree amendment, they \nought to do their debate on the second-degree amendment, face the vote \non the second-degree amendment, and move on. But you ought to get your \ntime to debate your motion at the time of the vote on the motion, not \nan hour later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I think the Senator from Wyoming has made \nan excellent case. We will try to orchestrate it in that manner, should \nwe get additional second degrees.\n  At this point, the debate for 2 minutes is on the second-degree \namendment, and Senator Ensign has a minute, and whoever claims the \nopposition has a minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, as I understand it, Senator Enzi has \nmade the point of order, has he not, on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Parliamentary inquiry: I think I would have to withdraw \nthat point of germaneness and he would have to withdraw his in order \nfor us to have continuing debate. Is that not true?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All debate is expired except under the order.\n  There is now 2 minutes of debate on the second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: Does that mean my \npoint of order was on my amendment and his motion to waive was on my \namendment, not on his?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending motion is to waive the point of \norder against the Ensign second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. ENZI. That will be what the debate is on? I thought debate did \nnot happen once the germaneness was entered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the order was changed.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, now that we have been through all that, \njust to restate, the managers of the underlying amendment believe their \nproposal is constitutional. But the lawyers for the private schools, \nthe ones who have looked at this, believe they could not accept the aid \nin a constitutional manner, that people will be able to bring a court \ncase against them and that they would lose if they did not change the \nway they do their instruction. They have a moral, religious-based \ninstruction. They believe they would have to change it.\n  Our amendment clearly makes the way they receive the funds \nconstitutional. We both want to provide help for those people who have \nbeen displaced, for those schools that have taken in these displaced \nstudents. We both want to have the help go. What we want to do, though, \nis allow the private schools to function as they have been functioning \nin the past. If you are a Catholic school, you would be able to \nfunction as a Catholic school functions and not be penalized for that \nbecause you have taken in these displaced students and are getting some \nFederal aid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I guess there have been a lot of \nconstitutional lawyers involved in all of this. I certainly want people \nto know we also conferred with constitutional lawyers and found a way \nto be able to do, on a one-time emergency basis, what needs to be done \nproperly for the kids of Katrina and for any other major event where we \nhave a large number of displaced students. But this one just deals with \nthe one-time emergency event. It is constitutional. It does not, \nhowever, as Senator Ensign would like to do, resolve the voucher issue, \nand it does not resolve the faith-based initiative issue. But it does \nget help to kids, and that is what we are trying to do with all the \neducation amendments we have today.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, as the chairman of the committee has \npointed out, we have reviewed and cleared this with constitutional \nauthorities. This is an indirect way of providing help and assistance \nto the children. The alternative is effectively a voucher program. We \nhave tried to stay clear from ideological fixes on this.\n  Let's treat the children with respect and the schools with respect \nand in the generosity with which they have treated these children. I \nhope the amendment will be defeated.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I would like to talk about the Enzi-\nKennedy amendment to S. 1932, the deficit reduction bill. We all want \nto do the right thing and help the hundreds of thousands of students \ndisplaced by Hurricane Katrina. Just a few weeks after the tragic \nevents surrounding Hurricane Katrina, I came to the floor of the Senate \nand offered an amendment to the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations \nbill to assist students and schools impacted by Hurricane Katrina. I \nalso cosponsored a bill with Senators Enzi and Kennedy, S. 1715, to \nassist schools and students impacted by Katrina. But I have tremendous \nconcerns about the amendment before us today.\n  This amendment sets up an unworkable mechanism to assist displaced \nstudents attending private schools. It requires states to funnel \nFederal dollars to local school districts to establish private accounts \nto pay the tuition to private schools. In contrast, current\n\n[[Page S12294]]\n\nlaw provides a reasonable mechanism for local school districts to \nassist students attending private schools, called equitable \nparticipation, without establishing a national voucher program. I \nsupport efforts to use equitable participation to assist private \nschools serving these displaced students. Unfortunately, this amendment \nfails to use this mechanism. At the same time, it establishes the first \nnational voucher program. Accordingly, along with educators, school \nboards, principals, teacher unions, and many civil rights and faith-\nbased organizations, I must oppose this provision.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, while the Enzi-Kennedy amendment passed on \na voice vote, I want the record to reflect my opposition to this \namendment.\n  We have all seen the devastation of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and \nI certainly understand and share my colleagues' desire to address the \nneeds of displaced school children.\n  Unfortunately, this amendment, which frankly is more than 2 months \noverdue, falls far short of the help needed for the affected families \nand public schools. It falls short financially, since it provides less \nmoney than these schools need in order to re-open and serve the \nchildren of the Gulf Coast. It also falls short constitutionally by \nmaking payments to private religious schools on behalf of students who \nfled these hurricanes and are now attending such schools across the \ncountry.\n  Now, I understand that these hurricanes did not differentiate between \npublic and private school students, and that we need to be able to \nprovide some assistance for all students affected by them. However, \nthis amendment is not the answer. As my colleagues are very well aware, \nwe currently have a mechanism in current law to provide support to \nstudents in private schools. We do it everyday under Title I and Title \nV of NCLB, and under IDEA.\n  These children should have been helped over 2 months ago with the \nfunding mechanisms we already have in place. That is why this amendment \nis not about getting help to these students. This is about using these \nstudents' needs as a pawn to further the Republican agenda of vouchers.\n  In addition, we are doing a disservice to families displaced by \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita by not informing them that this assistance \nis just for this school year. No where in this legislation is there a \nrequirement that parents be notified that this assistance is temporary \nand that it will not be renewed beyond August 2006. Instead of being \nfair to these parents by providing them with transparent information, \nthis amendment fails to include a provision to notify parents that this \nassistance is time-limited. We have an obligation to inform parents \nreceiving this assistance that this funding is a one-time deal. Without \nclear language on this point, language which I suggested to the \nsponsors of the amendment, parents will have an unfounded expectation \nthat this aid will be there next year and perhaps even for years to \ncome. These families are settling down in new communities, and they may \nlack the resources, ability, or desire to go back to the gulf coast.\n  Of course, we want to help families in their moment of need and \ndistress. I understand my colleague, Senator Landrieu's position on \nthis matter, and her sincere desire to help her constituents. I too \nbelieve this assistance to schools, both public and private, is \nimportant, needed, and appropriate. But this amendment could and should \nhave been structured in a way that contains clear notification \nrequirements and that mirrors current law.\n  This legislation is not the direction we should be heading. This \nlegislation is a stalking horse for a national voucher program. At the \nsame time, it provides less funding than is needed to repair and fund \nour devastated public schools. It provides very little accountability \nfor the use of taxpayers' funds and provides little or no enforcement \nof the civil rights protections that would exist if money were sent \nthrough existing funding mechanisms.\n  I want to thank Senators Enzi, Alexander, Kennedy, and Dodd, because \nI know that they have worked very hard to improve this amendment, and I \nappreciate their efforts. I urge my colleagues to continue to work to \naddress the concerns I have raised as this bill moves forward.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I support the Enzi amendment. This \namendment would provide $1.6 billion in emergency funding to address \nthe desperate funding needs of schools who have taken in displaced \nKatrina students and the schools that have been damaged or destroyed by \nthe hurricane.\n  Over 2 months ago, hundreds of thousands of children in the gulf \nregion were displaced from their homes, their communities, and their \nlocal schools. Neighboring communities have welcomed these students \nwith open arms. It is only fair to provide school districts the funds \nnecessary to educate and care for dislocated students left in the wake \nof Hurricane Katrina.\n  I know some are concerned about funding for displaced students who \nare attending private schools. However, this provision is carefully \ncrafted to ensure that funding flows directly to school districts, much \nlike similar provisions in Title I and special education. This program \nwill not set up a national school voucher program. Rather, it simply \nensures, on a temporary, one-time basis, that all students in need and \nschools that take them in have access to the relief they need. In this \nextraordinary circumstance, I believe that this provision takes a \nbalanced approach, and we will continue to monitor its implementation.\n  It is my hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting the Enzi \namendment, thereby supporting students who became displaced through no \nfault of their own.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S12295]]\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, the next amendment is the Lincoln \namendment. I ask unanimous consent that all votes on additional \namendments be 10 minutes.\n  We are going to clarify the issue of second-degree amendments that we \njust went through because, under the rule, all time has to expire on \ndebate on the first degree before you can debate a second degree or \noffer it. That is why we had the confusion before. We are going to \nadjust that through this unanimous consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that for the purposes of today's votes, all \nsecond-degree amendments must be offered prior to beginning the 2 \nminutes of debate on the underlying first-degree amendment. Before the \nChair rules, as a clarification, this will now mandate that second-\ndegree amendments must be offered before we begin the 2-minute debate \non the first degree. We would then have 2 minutes of debate on the \nsecond degree, both in relationship to the second degree, and then have \n2 minutes of debate on the first degree prior to the vote in \nrelationship to that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object, I would say to Senators \nwho are in the back of the Chamber, who are most interested in this \nquestion, this is a good time to hear what is being done to correct \nwhat occurred previously. What occurred previously was, under the rule, \nall time had to expire on the first-degree amendment before a second-\ndegree amendment could be offered. Under the interpretation of the \nChair, that included the 2 minutes of debate on the first-degree \namendment. Now what we are doing is modifying that through unanimous \nconsent agreement so if someone offers a second degree, they have to \noffer it before the 2 minutes of debate on the first degree. Then we \nwill be able to have 2 minutes of debate on the second degree, a vote \non the second degree. Then, in consideration of the first degree, we \nwill be able to have the 2 minutes of debate in conjunction with it. \nFor the interest of our colleagues, that is what is being done.\n  We should take this moment, as well, to say to our colleagues, we \nhave 35 amendments filed. That would take 12 hours of straight voting. \nWe have to end today at 6 o'clock, which would mean we would be in \ntomorrow for at least 4 hours. I ask our colleagues to show restraint \non calling up amendments that have been filed. We have had a good \ndebate on this matter. It has been an absolutely fair debate in terms \nof how we have been treated with respect to amendments being offered. \nWe really don't need to have 35 amendments offered to this measure. I \nurge my colleagues to show restraint.\n  I will not object.\n  Mr. GREGG. I also renew my request that votes on additional \namendments be 10-minute votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. The next amendment is that of Senator Lincoln.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2356, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes of debate evenly \ndivided on the Lincoln amendment.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN.

The Secretary shall use such sums as are necessary \n     to carry out this chapter.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, this amendment truly reflects the \nvalues that we hold as an American family. When one of us is sick or \nill, the rest of us are there to help. The amendment simply provides \nimmediate access to Medicaid for displaced individuals from the gulf \ncoast disaster. It provides full Federal support to the affected States \nonly in the Medicaid Program so that we don't leave them hanging \nwithout the means to be able to take care of their own people. We \nprovide disaster relief funds through an uncompensated care pool for \nour providers who have, without being asked, provided the care for \nthose individuals who needed it so desperately. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this. We have tried time and time again to do what is right. We \nhave the opportunity here. We have offered it many times. I encourage \nmy colleagues, please do the right thing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, this amendment is opposed by the Finance \nCommittee. The Finance Committee has aggressively funded this account \nwith $1.94 billion in this bill, which will cover 1.9 million victims \nof the hurricane. Therefore, these additional funds, if this amendment \nwere to pass, would basically put the Finance Committee section of the \nbill out of compliance with the Deficit Reduction Act. Therefore, we \noppose it.\n  I make a point of order that the pending amendment is not germane to \nthe measure now before the Senate. I raise that as a point of order \nunder section 305 of the Budget Act.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for consideration of the pending amendment, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Corzine) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my vote on \nthe motion to waive with respect to the Lincoln amendment No. 2356, as \nmodified, be recorded as a ``yea.'' This does not change the outcome of \nthe vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2355\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, we are now going to the Inhofe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, there have been many sincere, well-\nmeaning efforts to put fiscal discipline into this legislation. Some \npeople have tried to stop projects only to find out it does not save \nany money; it just causes them to rearrange their projects.\n  This amendment actually does that. This is the only amendment that \ndoes. I will read it for my colleagues:\n\n       All non-defense, non-trust fund discretionary spending \n     shall not exceed the previous fiscal year's level without a \n     two-thirds vote.\n\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, the pending amendment contains matter \nwithin the jurisdiction of the Committee on the Budget. I raise a point \nof order against the amendment under section 306 of the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back on the amendment?\n  Mr. INHOFE. No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, the amendment of the Senator from \nOklahoma would freeze spending on veterans, on homeland security, on \neducation, on National Institutes of Health, not just for 1 year but \npermanently--permanently. Permanently is a long time. The only way you \nget around it is a supermajority vote of 67 votes in the Senate.\n  I urge colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, what the Senator from North Dakota said \nis exactly right. That is exactly what this amendment does. And if you \nare really serious about doing something about the deficit, this is \nyour chance to do it.\n  This morning we passed the Agriculture appropriations conference \nreport which had a very small increase, but last week we passed the \nLabor-HHS appropriations bill with $107 billion more than the previous \nyear. This has to stop, and that is why this is a very significant \nvote.\n  Mr. President, I say to my conservative friends, this is going to be \nscored very heavily by conservative organizations, such as the National \nTaxpayers Union. I urge a positive vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I renew my point of order. The pending \namendment contains matter within the jurisdiction of the Committee on \nthe Budget. I raise a point of order against the amendment under \nsection 306 of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of the act for the consideration of the pending amendment. I \nurge a ``yes'' vote.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, my amendment would prevent a \nhike in Medicare premiums for our 42 million senior citizens. In the \nbill, doctors' fees are increased in their reimbursement. In my \namendment, that is paid for with drug company money that would be \nstaying the same under the existing law where the drug companies have \nto give discounts under the Medicaid law as they transition into \nMedicaid HMOs. This saves our seniors over $1 billion in increased \npremiums.\n  This amendment is supported and endorsed by the AARP. I want to \nwelcome the bipartisan support of the Senate for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the Nelson \namendment. I think everybody knows that the taxpayers pay 75 percent of \nthe Part B premium and 25 percent is paid by the individual. Whenever \nwe increase doctors' reimbursement--and we do that in this bill by 5.3 \npercent so that doctors do not lose their money--then, obviously, the \n25 percent is going to go up a little bit, just as the 75 percent goes \nup a little bit when reimbursement is increased.\n  The Senator from Florida takes offense at the fact that the premium \nis going to go up in the year 2007 by $1.69. It is the way the formula \nworks. I think every Senator wants to vote to give the doctors fair \nreimbursement because without doctors senior citizens cannot be served. \nSo we ought to let the formula work.\n  The offset is very egregious toward managed care as well. Also, do \nnot forget that low-income people, people on\n\n[[Page S12303]]\n\nMedicaid, do not pay the Part B and those who are not on Medicaid but \nbelow the poverty level have help through the QI program that we passed \nand the President signed recently to continue that program. So I hope \nmy colleagues will defeat the amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nsupport of Senator Nelson's amendment to protect seniors against the \noutrageous increases in their Medicare costs.\n  Health care costs are skyrocketing and seniors are paying a greater \nshare out of their pockets for health care each year. Medicare premium \nincreases are outpacing inflation. Prescription drug costs are shooting \nthrough the roof.\n  Other out-of-pocket medical expenses are also increasing. Seniors are \nfacing higher copays and deductibles. Last year's Medicare bill \nincreased deductibles for doctors' visits by 10 percent. Deductibles \nfor hospital and skilled nursing home visits are also rising.\n  Medicare beneficiaries spend a sizable portion of their income on \nhealth care. In 2004, beneficiaries spent about $3,725--nearly one-\nquarter--of their income on health care costs. Over the last 3 years, \nMedicare premiums have increased by 50 percent. Compare this to the \nonly 10-percent increase in seniors' cost-of-living adjustments, COLA. \nNext year, Part B premiums will increase by another 12 percent.\n  But there is another problem this amendment addresses. The current \nMedicare physician payment formula, known as the sustainable growth \nrate, SGR, has serious flaws. The current formula has generated \nnegative updates since 2001. Without congressional intervention, \nreimbursement rates for physicians in the Medicare Program will \ndecrease by 4.3 percent next year.\n  I have long supported fixing this flawed formula. With the majority \nof my colleagues, I have written letters to CMS Commissioner Dr. Mark \nMcClelan and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mr. \nJoshua Bolten. I have supported legislation trying to address this \nissue. Without a permanent fix, this uncertainty causes considerable \nangst among the physician community every year. Although I believe \nCongress needs to enact a long-term solution, this amendment supports a \n1 percent increase in the physician reimbursement rate for the next \nyear.\n  But this increase in physician payments will also increase overall \nspending on Medicare Part B. This will in turn increase Medicare \npremiums, which are set at 25 percent of Part B expenses. While I \nstrongly support the payment change, I believe it is equally important \nthat Medicare beneficiaries not have their premiums unexpectedly \nincreased.\n  This amendment ensures that Medicare beneficiaries will not have to \npay unexpectedly higher premiums in 2007 because of the payment changes \nfor 2006 in the Senate's budget reconciliation bill. This amendment \nprevents us from having to make a King Solomon-like decision. With this \namendment, we do not have to consider ``cutting the baby in half.'' We \ndo not have to decide between this modest increase to physician \nreimbursement and a further hike to our senior citizens--especially for \nthose who are forced to live on a fixed income.\n  In addition, the increase necessary to provide for physician \nreimbursement will not have to come from taxpayers. The offset for this \namendment is an expansion of a drug rebate program currently in place \nsince 1990. Drug manufacturers currently pay a rebate to participate in \nMedicaid. The Nelson amendment would offset the cost of protecting \nMedicare beneficiaries from the Part B premium increase by providing \nMedicaid managed care plans access to these drug rebates.\n  I think it is a good idea to expand the drug rebate program from \nMedicare fee-for-service to all of Medicaid, including the managed care \nprograms. When we first passed this law, 15 years ago, Medicaid managed \ncare did not have such a strong presence. It now accounts for much of \nMedicaid services and should be part of this rebate program.\n  I believe honor thy mother and father is not just a good commandment \nto live by, it is good public policy to govern by.\n  That's why I feel so strongly about Medicare. Congress created \nMedicare to provide a safety net for seniors. In 1965, seniors' biggest \nfear was the cost of hospital care. One heart attack could have put a \nfamily into bankruptcy. That is what Medicare Part A is all about.\n  Then Congress added Medicare Part B to help seniors pay for doctor \nvisits as an important step to keep seniors healthy and financially \nsecure. Now, Part B premium increases are racing ahead of seniors' \nability to pay. So seniors may lose the ability to pay for coverage for \ntheir doctor's visits.\n  This amendment is not an answer to skyrocketing health care costs, \nbut a stopgap measure to give seniors a little breathing room. I am \nworking hard on several bills to fix the Medicare bill that was passed \nlast year. I am fighting to protect seniors' Social Security COLAs from \nincreases in both Part B and Part D premiums.\n  I am fighting to close the coverage gap to provide a real drug \nbenefit for seniors. I am fighting to allow the Government to negotiate \nwith drug companies to lower the cost of prescription drugs to save \nmoney for the Government and for seniors. I am fighting to end the \ngiveaways to insurance companies and use those savings to improve \nMedicare.\n  And I could go on.\n  I am fighting to protect physician reimbursement rates by supporting \nlegislation and writing to government officials who have the authority \nto make changes to the flawed formula.\n  And I will continue to fight.\n  This amendment is a good step down in our constant attempt to reign \nin Medicare premium costs for seniors while protecting reimbursement \nrates for physicians.\n  Seniors cannot afford 17-percent increases in their Medicare \npremiums. Physicians cannot afford to have their reimbursement rates \ncut. I urge my colleagues to join me in expressing support for this \namendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2358\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we are making progress, but it is slow. The \nnext amendment is the amendment of Senator Cantwell, which is obviously \nthe big polar bear.\n\n[[Page S12304]]\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. My amendment strikes the language allowing for drilling \nin the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The underlying bill is a \nsweetheart deal for oil companies that have made a record $30 billion \nin profits last quarter. The bill gives oil companies a free ride with \nback-door language that allows them to circumvent environmental laws, \nlegal standards and Federal agency oversight that every other business \nin America has to comply with.\n  This wildlife area has been protected since the Eisenhower days, and \nfor good reason. There is an average of over 500 oil spills a year on \nthe Alaska North Slope and over 4,000 spills in the last 10 years. \nLet's not pollute one of the great last refuges of America, and let's \ntake the polluting language out of this bill. The Department of Energy \nsays drilling in ANWR will do nothing in the near term and very little \nin the long term, reducing gas prices by only one penny. America wants \na better energy plan than putting a sweetheart deal in the budget \nlanguage.\n  I urge my colleagues to strike this language.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr President, I join with my colleagues in strong \nopposition to opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, ANWR, to oil \ndrilling. I believe including it in a reconciliation package is a \nbackdoor attempt to achieve a shortsighted, environmentally \nirresponsible outcome. It is little more than a scheme to raise $2.5 \nbillion that will ultimately be used to cover a portion of the cost of \ntax cuts for the wealthy. Further, it will have a great and lasting \ncost to the environment with few benefits in terms of affordable \nenergy.\n  Let me lay out a few reasons why I oppose drilling in ANWR.\n  The area we are talking about is home to nearly 200 species of \nwildlife, including polar, grizzly, and black bears, rare musk oxen, \nand millions of migratory birds. Each year, thousands of caribou travel \nto the Coastal Plain of the Arctic Refuge to give birth to their \ncalves. It has been protected for decades, during Republican and \nDemocratic administrations. It is not as if we have said no to oil and \ngas exploration in the entire North Slope. It is only the remaining 5 \npercent--the Coastal Plain of the Arctic Refuge--that we want placed \noff limits. If we open this pristine land now, we can never turn the \nclock back. Setting the process in motion will entail a web of oil \nplatforms, pipelines, production facilities, power facilities, support \nstructures, and roads across the entire area. The administration \ncontention that development would be confined to a 2,000-acre footprint \nis simply false because the recoverable oil is spread out in small \ndeposits across the entire Coastal Plain.\n  I firmly believe we need to ensure our country's economic security, \nbut drilling in ANWR will do nothing to reduce our energy price and \nsupply problems in the near term and very little to reduce our \ndependence on foreign supplies of oil. With transportation accounting \nfor nearly 70 percent of oil use in this country, the Bush \nadministration and many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nhave refused to tackle the issue of automobile fuel efficiency. \nAccording to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, if \nthe Corporate Average Fuel Economy, CAFE, standards are raised by just \n5 percent annually until 2012, and by just 3 percent thereafter, more \nthan 1.5 million barrels of oil per day could be saved by 2010, and 67 \nbillion barrels of oil over the next 40 years--more than 10 times what \ncould be recovered in ANWR. In 1998, the U.S. Geological Survey \nestimated that there is no more than 5.2 billion barrels of \neconomically recoverable oil in ANWR, a number that is equivalent to \nwhat the United States consumes in about 6 months.\n  Any recoverable oil that might be below the Refuge would not begin \nflowing for at least 10 years and would never meet more than a small \npercentage of our oil needs at any given time. So, therefore, it would \nhave no impact on my constituents and your constituents for at least a \ndecade. Further, the Energy Information Administration, EIA, has said \nthat because the price of oil is set by the world market, ANWR would \nhave a negligible impact on gasoline prices.\n  The United States dependence on foreign oil is growing, with current \nimports at 58 percent. We currently have about 3 percent of the world's \noil reserves but consume more than a quarter of the world's oil supply. \nWe simply cannot drill our way out of our problems. Last year, EIA \nstated that at peak production, oil from ANWR would account for just a \nfraction of our consumption--no more than 4 percent. Further, there is \nno guarantee that any oil produced domestically from ANWR would make it \nto the rest of the country. There is no assurance that it will not all \nbe exported to foreign countries. It is simply too big a risk to take \nwhen there are other, less intrusive ways to truly alleviate our \ndependence on oil--fuel efficiency, renewable and alternative sources \nof energy, and, dare I say it, conservation, something the Bush \nadministration would have you now believe it wholly endorses.\n  ANWR drilling proponents are always quick to contend that 735,000 \njobs would be created by opening this area to oil extraction. Those \nestimates are based on figures from 15 years ago that the forecasters \nhave since acknowledged were based on flawed assumptions. In October \n2005, the Congressional Research Service reported that full development \nof the Arctic Refuge would result in 60,000 jobs. Even the three oil \ncompanies that stand to reap the most profits by expanding their \npresence in Alaska--ExxonMobil, BP, and Conoco-Phillips--have been \nrelatively silent this year about their interest in ANWR.\n  Little oil industry interest, less job creation than anticipated, \nminimal recoverable oil deposits, no impact on current energy prices \nand negligible impact on future prices, no reduction in foreign oil \ndependence, and a web of infrastructure across the Coastal Plain--does \nthat justify pillaging the Arctic Refuge? I think it is irresponsible \nto do so.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support the Cantwell amendment and \nwork with us to enact policies that provide economic relief for \nresidential and business consumers and set our country on a path to \nenergy security.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to oppose drilling in the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge. Opening the refuge is not the answer to \nsolving our country's energy needs. We cannot drill our way out of our \nenergy problems.\n  We need to focus on real solutions not gimmicks--solutions that \ndecrease our dependence of foreign oil, protect the environment and \nhelp consumers at a time when the costs to fill up their gas tanks and \nheat their homes are at all time highs.\n  If we open the Arctic Refuge for oil and gas drilling, it would \nprovide only about a 6-month supply of oil and would not even be \navailable for 10 or more years. That means that drilling in the \nwildlife refuge would not affect our current oil and gasoline prices \nnor will it reduce our country's dependence on foreign oil. Even in 10 \nor so years when we might get the oil, drilling in the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge will help little if at all.\n  Rather than trying to get a couple of months of oil supply in 10 \nyears, we need to address the most pressing issues facing our country \nnow: our growing dependence on foreign oil, sky-high oil and gas \nprices, and global warming. This is what I have been fighting for--real \nsolutions to real problems that would help today's consumers and \ntomorrow's energy needs.\n  That is why I fought to include an amendment to the Commerce, \nJustice, Science Appropriations bill that would provide a million \ndollars to the Federal Trade Commission to immediately investigate \nclaims of price gouging. While oil companies and refineries report \nrecord profits, American consumers shouldn't have to scrimp to buy \ngasoline to go to work, or church or to buy groceries. I also \ncosponsored a bill that would place a federal ban on price gouging for \noil, gasoline and other petroleum products during times of energy \nemergencies. To drive this point home, I sent a letter to the \nchairwoman of the FTC, expressing my concern over the consolidation of \noil refineries, resulting in the lack of competition.\n  I also recently sent a letter to President Bush urging him to convene \na White House summit of oil and gas company CEOs to insist that they\n\n[[Page S12305]]\n\nlower their sky-high gas and home heating oil prices. These are some of \nthe President's closets political supporters and friends They are also \nthe same men and women who the President called on to write the \nadministration's energy policy in 2001. If the President can call them \nin to help themselves, he should call them back to help ordinary \nAmericans. Another letter called on the oil and gas company CEOs to \ntemporarily halt unnecessary exports of any home heating oil products \nthat they are currently sending abroad. We cannot expect Americans to \npay over $1,000 to heat their homes this winter when U.S. companies are \nexporting billions of gallons of refined heating oil and propane.\n  We need to find solutions for tomorrow's energy needs as well as \nthose facing Americans today. I introduced a bill that would provide \ntax incentives for energy efficient hybrid and fuel cell vehicles, \nwhich was included in the Energy bill. I also voted for a proviso in \nthe Senate energy bill that would have required utilities to generate \n10 percent of their energy from renewable sources. In addition, I \nsupported a provision in the bill that requires the Federal Government \nto get at least 7.5 percent of our energy from renewable sources by \n2013. I also supported an amendment that would require the U.S. to \nreduce foreign oil imports by 40 percent in 20 years\n  Just last week, oil companies reported record third quarter profits, \nsome more than 85 percent higher than last year. As Americans struggle \nto fill their gas tanks and pay high home heating bills, the oil and \ngas companies are filling their pockets with historic profits. And now, \nhere we are, in the Senate, giving them the opportunity to drill in \nfederally protected land.\n  This is not a time to reward oil and gas companies with the promise \nof more profits. We need to give these companies the opportunity to be \npatriots--not profiteers. They need to join us by holding down prices, \ninvesting in renewable energy, serving the needs of Americans and \nconserving as much as possible. Together, America can do better.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Who yields time in opposition? The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me say to the Senate it is finally \ntime. It is finally time that we decide to do something about our oil \ndependency. It is time that we do something for the American people \nabout the rising, escalating price of gasoline at the pump.\n  As I see it, this is a rare opportunity to produce substantial \nquantities of crude oil from our own homeland, from one of our States. \nNot only will it produce oil, it will produce the equivalent of what \nthe State of Texas has in reserves. To say it has very little is to say \nthe full State of Texas has very little reserves.\n  It will produce jobs, up to 736,000. You see them on this list. \nAmerica cries out for good jobs. We wonder why we don't have them. Then \nwe ignore our own source of supply which would create them.\n  Any time I have left I yield to the Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 5 seconds.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this is the Senate's opportunity and \nthe country's opportunity to address our national security, our energy \nsecurity, and our environmental security. Defeat this amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?

Madam President, you cannot look the public in the eye \nafter all the speeches about how the oil is needed here at home and \npass legislation that is an invitation to export Alaskan oil to \ncountries such as China. The history is, if you do not ban these \nexports, this oil is going to go to Asia. That was confirmed not long \nago by oil company executives who came before the Senate Commerce \nCommittee. Without this amendment, there is no assurance that even one \ndrop of Alaskan oil will get to hurting Americans.

The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we now go to Senator Grassley's amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, will the Senator withhold for one moment?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, colleagues, we now have a list of the \nnumber of amendments that have been filed and that are pending and that \nSenators have noticed to us they intend to insist to have a vote on. \nThat is 25 in number. That would take 8 hours. We have to stop at 6 \no'clock. There is no way we would complete business today if every one \nof our colleagues insists on a vote on their amendment.\n  So I am asking on our side--I am asking, please--if you have an \namendment filed that you really don't need a vote on or that you could \npossibly work out, let's work very hard in the next few hours to try to \nwork it out. I would implore colleagues to not force a vote on every \namendment they have filed.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would like to second the request of the \nSenator from North Dakota. I think it is a very appropriate statement.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2359\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the amendment?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this is a bipartisan amendment, the \nGrassley-Dorgan amendment, with a lot of cosponsors. We have a problem \nin the existing bill that will hurt family farmers. It cuts farm \npayments across the board for 100 percent of the farmers. It cuts \nconservation programs, so it harms the environment to a greater extent. \nWhat we do is solve a problem and help every family farmer in the \nprocess.\n  Ten percent of the farmers in the United States get 72 percent of the \nbenefit out of the farm program. That is unfair. The farm programs have \nalways been targeted toward medium- and small-sized farmers. So we put \nin a hard cap of $250,000. Mr. President, $250,000 is all one farm \nentity can get from the farm program. We redistribute that money so we \ndo not have that 2.5-percent cut. We restore some money for \nconservation and things of that nature.\n  So I hope you will support our amendment. The last time it was up, we \ngot 66 votes for it.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, reducing overall Federal spending on farm \nprograms is important if we are to succeed in reducing the Federal \nbudget deficit. The current budget-reconciliation package includes $39 \nbillion in savings, including $3 billion from agriculture programs. To \nachieve these savings, the Senate Agriculture Committee cuts farm \nspending by implementing an-across-the-board 2.5 percent reduction in \npayments for all farm commodities. I wholeheartedly support these cuts \nin farm spending.\n  However, I cannot support waiving the Budget Act to consider the \nGrassley Dorgan amendment to impose more restrictive payment limits on \nfarm commodities. This amendment is being offered as a substitute to \nthe cost savings achieved by the fair, across-the-board reductions \ncurrently in the package. Substituting the Grassley-Dorgan payment \nlimits is eerily reminiscent of the flawed formula in the highway bill: \nInstead of all States bearing the burden equally, the farm cuts would \nbe achieved on the backs of Arizona farmers and other farmers of \ncapital intensive crops in the West and South.\n  The advocates of the Grassley-Dorgan amendment claim that reducing \npayment limits preserves the family farm. What they meant to say is \nthat it preserves family farms in North Dakota, Iowa, and other \nMidwestern States that grow certain commodities: namely grains and \noilseeds such as corn, wheat, and soybeans. Family farmers in Arizona \nfarm cotton. It is a highly capital intensive crop, in fact, one of the \ntwo most expensive program crops to grow. To illustrate, cotton program \npayments represent 39 percent of western farmers' cash costs of \nproduction. Corn and wheat program payments represent 49 percent and 50 \npercent of Midwestern farmers' cash costs, respectively.\n  Thus, in order to achieve economies of scale and remain competitive, \nArizona farms must be large. According the Economic Research Service, \nover 30 percent of cotton production occurs on farms operating on an \naverage of 3,500 acres. Are we to believe that none of these large \nfarms are owned by Arizona families? I know for a fact that they are.\n  The average farming operation in Arizona consists of about 7,000 \nacres. Using a farm in near Buckeye, AZ as an example, this family farm \nis run by four brothers. Several children are managers of the \noperation, including performing marketing and financial services. About \na third of the farm grows cotton, about a third grows feed grains, and \nthe remaining third alfalfa. The annual budget is $5 million, and the \nbrothers draw an annual salary of about $50,000 each when the farm \ngenerates sufficient income. This farm would be hit hard by the payment \nlimitations in the Grassley-Dorgan amendment. Its operators would be \nforced to cut the amount of acres on which they grow cotton. In years \nwhen prices decline at harvest, their cash flow would be restricted and \ntheir ability to qualify for financing would be severely hampered.\n\n  The Grassley-Dorgan amendment, in equating large with bad, ultimately \nfavors growers of corn, wheat, and soybeans at the expense of farmers \nof cotton, rice, and peanuts. To further illustrate what I am talking \nabout, let us apply the limitations in the amendment: a farm that \nproduces cotton or rice would, at today's world prices and average \nyields, hit the limit on payments at about 400 to 600 acres. This \nacreage is generally deemed to be too small to sustain the investment \nin the specialized equipment necessary for cotton and rice production. \nIn contrast, a corn farmer with an expected yield of 190 bushels per \nacre, would not hit the limit on payments until just over 3,100 acres. \nClearly, very few corn farmers will ever feel the effects of the \nGrassley-Dorgan amendment.\n  It has been further estimated that the more restrictive eligibility \nrules that are part of the amendment, combined with the limits on \ndirect payments, would reduce direct payments to Arizona growers by \n$24.6 million. This represents a reduction of 62 percent, the highest \nof any State. Iowa would see a loss of just 4 percent and North Dakota, \n10 percent.\n  I am not going to argue that the farm law is off limits for the \npurpose of finding savings for the American taxpayer. However, I \nencourage my colleagues to look closely at the ways we achieve that \nsavings. It is simply not fair to use a faulty perception of what\n\n[[Page S12307]]\n\nconstitutes a family farm to favor one farming region of the country at \nthe expense of another. Yet, that is exactly what the Grassley-Dorgan \namendment would do. Thus, I cannot support a motion to waive the Budget \nAct with respect to this amendment and must vote against it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, in 2002, this body, along with the \nHouse and along with the President, made a commitment to farmers and \nranchers all across America with the signing and implementation of the \n2002 farm bill. This was an issue back then, in 2002, in the farm bill. \nIt will be an issue in the farm bill in 2007.\n  Today, when our farmers are hit with high fuel prices, with low \ncommodity prices, and with disasters all across the country in \ndifferent sections, this is not the time to say to our farmers, who \nfeed all of America, we are going to change the program in midstream. \nThis issue will be dealt with in the farm bill in 2007.\n  Mr. President, I raise a point of order under section 305 of the \nBudget Act that the pending amendment is not germane to the measure now \nbefore the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904(c) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive section 305 of the \nBudget Act for the consideration of amendment No. 2359, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment deals with the fact that \nunder current law, 31 of our States are seeing significant cuts in \nFederal support for Medicaid because of a reduction in the percentage \nthe Federal Government will pay, the FMAP, as we always refer to it, \nthe Federal matching rate. Alaska is held harmless in the underlying \nbill. They will not suffer a cut. My amendment would say that for the \nother 30 States, the cut should not be more than five-tenths of 1 \npercent next year. The amendment is more than offset. In fact, the \noffset is supported strongly by Secretary Leavitt's Medicaid \nCommission. It is supported strongly by the National Governors \nAssociation. It would save the States over $3 billion if this offset is \nagreed to as part of this amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. This map shows the \nStates in red that would get a more fair share of Medicaid funds, if \nthe amendment passes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask Members to vote no on this \namendment. There is an odd situation here. We have had a formula in the \nlegislation for 40 years. That formula regularly has some States \ngetting more reimbursement, some States getting less. Next year your \nState might go up. The next year it might go down. That is the way it \nhas been working. All of a sudden, some States are receiving a \nreduction, and they want to keep it where it is. I have never had a \nsituation where, when the formula worked to the benefit of the State, \ntheir reimbursement went up, that you come in here and ask for us to \nreduce the reimbursement. No, you accept the formula. If you want to \nchange the formula, Senator Baucus and I have a good plan to change the \nformula. It would smooth out the peaks and valleys. That is what we \nought to be doing instead of piecemeal doing it this way. I ask Members \nto vote against the amendment.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2365, as Modified\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

There is 2 minutes equally divided on the Lott \namendment No. 2360.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the next amendment is the Lott amendment, \nthe Amtrak amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2360.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will take a couple minutes to discuss the \namendment. First of all, my cosponsor on this amendment is Senator \nLautenberg.\n  This is an amendment that adds provisions of S. 1516, the Passenger \nRail Investment and Improvement Act of 2005. It was reported out of the \nCommerce Committee in July and has been ready to be considered by the \nSenate, but repeated efforts to have it brought up in the regular order \nwere not cleared.\n  We are running out of time. The administration has made it clear that \nwithout reform, they are not going to be supportive of future funds \nthrough the appropriations process for Amtrak. This is genuine reform \nwith a lot of input from management and labor, the administration, and \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  I believe this is the last chance for the Senate to act on this \nimportant legislation, making it possible for us to have it included in \nsome legislation, before we finish this year, to reform Amtrak.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I appreciate the work the Senator from \nMississippi and the Senator from New Jersey have done on this bill.\n  It is absolutely true that this does represent some significant \nadditional reforms for Amtrak. In discussions with Senator Lott from \nMississippi and others, I do believe there is an opportunity to do a \nlot more. Unfortunately, the House has not really undertaken any reform \neffort at all, and that is certainly one of the concerns that I have, \nthat this not be a dead-end process, that we do more in this bill to \ndeal with long distance routes that lose $200 or $300 per passenger on \nevery single car that rides on those long distance routes and labor \nconstraints that the management of Amtrak has said they want to have \nmodified and adjusted so they can operate more effectively and more \nefficiently. These items are not in this legislation, although it does \nrepresent a step forward.\n  I look forward to continuing to work to improve the legislation, but \nI certainly cannot support its adoption on this reconciliation bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I note that Senator Burns has also been \nactive in this process.\n  I ask unanimous consent that other Senators' names be allowed to be \nadded as cosponsors to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Corzine) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is 2 minutes now equally divided prior \nto a vote on the McCain amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment does one very simple thing. \nIt would move the DTV transition date forward by 1 year, making the \ncompletion date April 7, 2008. My colleagues will be asked to believe \nthe earlier date is not doable. Do not believe it. We have the ability. \nWe have the technology. It can be accomplished. It is supported by \nevery first responder organization in America, every single one. The \nNational Governors Association: We support the amendment, based upon \ncertain clearing of channels. People's lives are at stake. The only \npeople who are against this amendment are the National Association of \nBroadcasters. We will see if they win again.\n\n[[Page S12309]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment would close off the analog \nbroadcasting too close to the auction of spectrum. We currently have an \nApril 2009 date. The auction date is January of 2009. It is just too \nclose together. The leases cannot be processed. There is no way those \nauction proceeds can be available until licenses are issued. This \namendment would end analog broadcasts before the funds are available \nfor the converter box fund or the translator conversion fund authorized \nby S. 1932. We need help in this transition. The amendment makes \nspectrum available to public safety groups before they can put it to \nuse because we are informed public safety groups must have at least 3 \nyears to prepare for the use of spectrum.\n  We are going to get them the spectrum. They will not be able to use \nit until we have the money to bring about the transition. I believe our \nwhole committee should oppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

At the pace \nwe are going, we are not going to get them all done today, and we are \ngoing to be here on Friday.\n  I ask, Mr. President, if we can be advised as to how long the last \nthree votes have taken. If we could hear from the clerks, approximately \nhow long? We do not have to be precise.\n  How long have the votes taken?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. An hour 6 minutes for three votes.\n  Mr. GREGG. At this pace, we are here Friday.\n  I hope Members will think about their amendments, if they have some \nthey are still talking about, and give serious consideration to \nallowing a voice vote or allowing it to be worked out.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 2368, Withdrawn\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Corzine amendment, No. 2368, be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2372\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we are now on to Senator Murray's \namendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nCorzine be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, in a few short weeks some of our most \nvulnerable Americans, our sickest and poorest, so-called dual \neligibles, are going to be shifted from Medicaid to Medicare. We have a \ntrain wreck coming. Medicare is going to randomly assign these people \nto a plan which they may not know about and which might not cover their \nlifesaving drugs. Doctors, hospitals, and pharmacists are scrambling. \nThese prescription drug policies themselves have not defined the drugs \nthey are going to cover. My amendment simply gives a 6-month transition \nfor those people so they do not get lost in this switch. I support \nMedicare coverage for these dual eligibles, but I cannot--and I don't \nthink we should--support turning these people away at the drugstore.\n  This amendment does not delay the implementation of the Medicare drug \nbenefit. It simply assures thousands of our most vulnerable Americans \nthat they will not be lost in the transition from Medicaid to Medicare \ncoverage.\n  I thank Senator Rockefeller and my cosponsors, and I urge adoption of \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, CMS has a plan in place, and 6 months ago \nCMS introduced a strategy for transitioning dual eligibles from \nMedicaid to Medicare which lays out in great detail the steps CMS will \ntake to ensure the continuity of coverage of this valuable group of \nbeneficiaries. Therefore, the leadership of the Finance Committee \nstrongly opposes this amendment.\n  I make a point of order that the pending amendment is not germane to \nthe measure now before the Senate, and I raise a point of order under \nsection 305 of the Budget Act.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act, I move to waive the applicable sections of \nthat act for purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The pending question is the Landrieu amendment \nnumbered 2366.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield to the Senator from Louisiana for the purpose of \nsending a modification to the desk.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, with Senator Landrieu's consent, I request \nthe Landrieu amendment be withdrawn, and we call up the Stevens-Vitter-\nLandrieu-Domenici amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2412\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter], for Mr. Stevens, \n     for himself, Mr. Vitter, Ms. Landrieu, and Mr. Domenici, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2412.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To modify the distribution of excess proceeds from the \n auction authorized by section 309(j)(15)(C)(v) of the Communications \n                              Act of 1934)\n\n       On page 95, strike lines 13 through 21, and insert the \n     following:\n       (f) Use of Excess Proceeds.--Any proceeds of the auction \n     authorized by section 309(j)(15)(C)(v) of the Communications \n     Act of 1934, as added by section 3003 of this Act, that \n     exceed the sum of the payments made from the Fund under \n     subsection (c), the transfer from the Fund under subsection \n     (d), and any amount made available under section 3006 \n     (referred to in this subsection as ``excess proceeds''), \n     shall be distributed as follows:\n       (1) The first $1,000,000,000 of excess proceeds shall be \n     transferred to and deposited in the general fund of the \n     Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.\n       (2) After the transfer under paragraph (1), the next \n     $500,000,000 of excess proceeds shall be transferred to the \n     interoperability fund described in subsection (c)(3).\n       (3) After the transfers under paragraphs (1) and (2), the \n     next $1,200,000,000 of exceess proceeds shall be transfered \n     to the assistance program described in subsection (c)(5).\n       (4) After the transfers under paragraphs (1) through (3), \n     any remaining excess proceeds shall be transferred to and \n     deposited in the general fund of the Treasury as \n     miscellaneous receipts.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes of debate evenly divided.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I present this on behalf of Mr. Stevens, \nthe main author, as well as myself, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Domenici, Mr. \nBingaman, Mr. Lott, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Craig, and others. This will not \nchange our budget numbers or our goal of deficit reduction in any way. \nIn fact, it could enhance it.\n  This amendment says if and when--and only if and when--the spectrum \nauction produces more than is forecast, the first $1 billion over that \namount would go to deficit reduction, the next $500 million would go to \ninteroperability, the next $1.2 billion, in that order, goes to a \ncoastal program under Commerce jurisdiction, and the remainder, if at \nall, would go to deficit reduction. This could, in fact, enhance \ndeficit reduction.\n  Of course, it is very important to coastal States, including \nLouisiana, to beef up the coastline and to protect us in the future \nfrom major storms like Hurricane Katrina.\n  I yield the remaining time to Senator Landrieu.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Louisiana and \nparticularly thank the leadership of Senator Stevens and Senator \nDomenici and so many who have joined the effort. It has been a great \neffort. We thank our colleagues.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask for a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2412) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, just to update our colleagues, we now have \n19 amendments still pending. On our current course, that is going to \ntake at least 6\\1/2\\ hours. That would take us to 8:30. I ask \ncolleagues, please, if you can withhold on your amendment, do so. If \nyou have a chance to work out the amendment, please work hard and \ndiligently to work it out. I urge colleagues, we have a drop-dead time \nat 6 o'clock tonight. We cannot go beyond that with business. We have \nless than 4 hours to go through 19 amendments. The only way this is \ngoing to happen is if colleagues will give up on some of their \namendments. Otherwise, we are here tomorrow. Once we are here tomorrow, \nwe all know what happens: we will be here a long time tomorrow.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2367\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the reconciliation bill would increase \nimmigrant work visas by 350,000 per year, about one-third of the \ncurrent level. It is a massive and destabilizing increase that does not \nbelong on the reconciliation bill.\n  My amendment would strike the increase in immigrant work visas and \nimpose a $1,500 immigrant application fee on multinational \ncorporations. With my amendment, the Judiciary Committee would exceed \nits reconciliation savings targets and do so without increasing \nimmigrant work visas. We authorized over half a million H-1B visas in \n2000. Last year, we authorized another $100,000 over 5 years. Do we \nreally need another 150,000 visas on top of that? When is enough \nenough?\n  My amendment has the support of the unions. It has the support of \nimmigrant enforcement groups. It has the support of Republican and \nDemocrat Senators. I urge agreement of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am opposed to this amendment because \nthe fees for L visas would raise funds but would do nothing to fill \nvery important jobs in the United States. The existing plan submitted \nby the Judiciary Committee imposes a fee, but it extends the H-1B visa \nand recaptures the visas which were not used in the last 5 years. There \nare very careful safeguards so that U.S. jobs are not lost.\n  I understand the position of the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, the position of the unions, but I believe their concerns are \nmisplaced and that there is a real need for these positions of highly \nskilled professionals, Ph.D.s, advanced degrees. Therefore, with due \nrespect to my colleague from West Virginia, I ask for a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Corzine) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the next item is the Harkin amendment, a \nsense of the Senate. I ask unanimous consent that we have 2 minutes \nequally divided on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. For the information of the Senate, we are now off of the \noriginal list, having completed that. So we are into a period where, \nbetween myself and the Senator from North Dakota, we have organized a \nseries of amendments to come forward. These will continue to be 10-\nminute votes, and they are going to be hard 10 minutes. That means that \nat the end of 10 minutes, I am going to ask the vote to be closed. \nSecondly, I ask unanimous consent that for all amendments which are \nbrought forward from here on, there be 2 minutes equally divided \nbetween the proponent and the opponent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let us repeat the message loud and clear: \nThese next three votes are going to be strict 10-minute votes. At the \nend of 10 minutes, the manager and I are going to call the vote. That \nis the only possible, conceivable way we can get done today.\n  Mr. GREGG. Of course, we may actually get a voice vote in here, \nhopefully.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2363\n\n  (Purpose: To affirm that the Federal funding levels for the rate of \n reimbursement of child support administrative expenses should not be \nreduced below the levels provided under current law, that States should \n    continue to be permitted to use Federal child support incentive \n payments for child support program expenditures that are eligible for \nFederal matching payments, and to express the sense of the Senate that \n   it does not support additional fees for successful child support \n                              collection)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, my amendment is a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution that the Senate go on record opposing the House's $9 billion \ncut to child support enforcement programs. It is not reasonable to cut \na program that last year served 17,300,000 children. This is money that \ngoes out to States for child support enforcement to go after deadbeat \ndads to get them to pay the money for child support. As a matter of \nfact, this is one of the best things that has happened out of welfare \nreform. For every $1 we spend, we are getting back $4.38, not to the \nGovernment but to the families and the kids who need it. This is just a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution that says we do not agree with the House \n40-percent cut in this program and we won't hold up to it when it goes \nto the conference. It is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  The bill approved by Ways and Means would slash funding for child \nsupport enforcement efforts by 40 percent over the next 10 years. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that, as a result of these cuts, \nmore than $24 billion in delinquent payments will go uncollected. And \nthe biggest negative impacts will be felt by children living in poverty \nand children in low-income households.\n  And let's be clear: Why is the House doing this? Why is it cutting \nthis essential program that benefits some of the most vulnerable, \ndisadvantaged, neglected children in our society? They are doing this \nin order to make room for another $70 billion in tax cuts--tax cuts \noverwhelmingly benefiting our wealthiest citizens.\n  Indeed, that is what this entire reconciliation process is all about. \nFor 25 years, the budget reconciliation process was used to reduce the \ndeficit. But, today, the majority party has a different idea. They are \nusing reconciliation to increase the deficit. They are cutting child \nsupport enforcement, food assistance for the poor, foster care \nbenefits, Medicaid, and other programs for the most disadvantaged \nAmericans. At the same time they are ramming through another $70 \nbillion in tax cuts for the most privileged.\n  There is no other word for it: This is simply immoral. Last year, \nmore than 17 million children received financial support through the \nChild Enforcement System, including nearly two-thirds of all children \nin single-parent households with incomes below twice the poverty line.\n  Child support helped to lift more than 1 million Americans out of \npoverty in 2002. As a result of cuts passed by the House, many of those \npeople--mostly children--would be plunged back into poverty. Not only \nis this cruel, it is also counterproductive. It is penny wise and pound \nfoolish, because those families that are shoved into poverty by the \nHouse's action will end up on food stamps, Medicaid, Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families, and other forms of public assistance.\n  This chart shows the State-by-State impact of the cut in child \nsupport collection. In my State of Iowa, alone, children would lose \nsome $239 million over the next 10 years. This is a proven program, an \neffective program. It reduces poverty. It gets resources to children \nwho desperately need them. It is cost effective. Research has shown \nthat the decline in families relying on TANF in recent years is \ndirectly linked to improvements in the Child Support Enforcement \nProgram. For all these reasons, this program has enjoyed broad \nbipartisan support.\n\n  In the past, President Bush himself has praised this program, calling \nit one of our highest performing social services programs. And he is \nright because for every Government dollar spent, $4.38 is recovered for \nfamilies in child support payments. With good reason. Reforms over the \nlast decade have made this program even more effective. Since 1996, \nthere has been an 82-percent increase in collections, from $12 billion \nto $22 billion.\n  Child Support Enforcement is essential to helping families to achieve \nself-sufficiency. For families in poverty who receive child support, \nthose payments account for an average of 30 percent of their income. \nNext to a mother's earnings, child support is the largest income source \nfor poor families receiving assistance. Child support payments are used \nto pay for food, child care, shelter, and the most basic essentials of \nlife.\n  If we were smart, if we were compassionate, if we were looking at \nways to get maximum bang for the buck, we would be increasing funding \nfor this essential program. But the action of the other body, slashing \nChild Support Enforcement by 40 percent to make way for more tax cuts, \nis just unconscionable. It is bad public policy, bad values, and bad \npriorities.\n  A strong bipartisan vote for this resolution will send a strong \nmessage to the House conferees that this cut is unacceptable to the \nSenate and that this body will not accept a slash-and-burn attack on a \nprogram that lifts more than 1 million people out of poverty every \nyear. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself, Mr. Kohl, \n     Mr. Obama, and Mr. Bayh, proposes an amendment numbered 2363.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) On October 26, 2005, the Committee on Ways and Means of \n     the United States House of Representatives approved a budget \n     reconciliation package that would significantly reduce the \n     Federal Government's funding used to pay for the child \n     support program established under part D of title IV of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 651 et seq.) and would \n     restrict the ability of States to use Federal child support \n     incentive payments for child support program expenditures \n     that are eligible for Federal matching payments.\n       (2) The child support program enforces the responsibility \n     of non-custodial parents to support their children. The \n     program is jointly funded by Federal, State and local \n     governments.\n       (3) The Office of Management and Budget gave the child \n     support program a 90 percent rating under the Program \n     Assessment Rating Tool (PART), making it the highest \n     performing social services program.\n       (4) The President's 2006 budget cites the child support \n     program as ``one of the highest rated block/formula grants of \n     all reviewed programs government-wide. This high rating is \n     due to its strong mission, effective management, and \n     demonstration of measurable\n\n[[Page S12312]]\n\n     progress toward meeting annual and long term performance \n     measures.''\n       (5) In 2004, the child support program spent $5,300,000,000 \n     to collect $21,900,000,000 in support payments. Public \n     investment in the child support program provides more than a \n     four-fold return, collecting $4.38 in child support for every \n     Federal and State dollar that the program spends.\n       (6) In 2004, 17,300,000 children, or 60 percent of all \n     children living apart from a parent, received child support \n     services through the program. The percentage is higher for \n     poor children--84 percent of poor children living apart from \n     their parent receive child support services through the \n     program. Families assisted by the child support program \n     generally have low or moderate incomes.\n       (7) Children who receive child support from their parents \n     do better in school than those that do not receive support \n     payments. Older children with child support payments are more \n     likely to finish high school and attend college.\n       (8) The child support program directly decreases the costs \n     of other public assistance programs by increasing family \n     self-sufficiency. The more effective the child support \n     program in a State, the higher the savings in public \n     assistance costs.\n       (9) Child support helps lift more than 1,000,000 Americans \n     out of poverty each year.\n       (10) Families that are former recipients of assistance \n     under the temporary assistance for needy families program \n     (TANF) have seen the greatest increase in child support \n     payments. Collections for these families increased 94 percent \n     between 1999 and 2004, even though the number of former TANF \n     families did not increase during this period.\n       (11) Families that receive child support are more likely to \n     find and hold jobs, and less likely to be poor than \n     comparable families without child support.\n       (12) The child support program saved costs in the TANF, \n     Medicaid, Food Stamps, Supplemental Security Income, and \n     subsidized housing programs.\n       (13) The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the \n     funding cuts proposed by the Committee on Ways and Means of \n     the House of Representatives would reduce child support \n     collections by nearly $7,900,000,000 in the next 5 years and \n     $24,100,000,000 in the next 10 years.\n       (14) That National Governor's Association has stated that \n     such cuts are unduly burdensome and will force States to \n     reevaluate several services that make the child support \n     program so effective.\n       (15) The Federal Government has a moral responsibility to \n     ensure that parents who do not live with their children meet \n     their financial support obligations for those children.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Senate will not accept any reduction in funding for \n     the child support program established under part D of title \n     IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 651 et seq.), or any \n     restrictions on the ability of States to use Federal child \n     support incentive payments for child support program \n     expenditures that are eligible for Federal matching payments, \n     during this Congress.\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \nHarkin amendment, which expresses the sense of the Senate that this \nbody will not accept the cuts to the child support program that have \nbeen proposed by the Committee on Ways and Means in the House of \nRepresentatives. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The child support program is an effective and efficient way to \nenforce the responsibility of noncustodial parents to support their \nchildren. For every public dollar that is spent on collection, more \nthan $4 is collected to support children. That is a good return on our \ninvestment in families. Moreover, these families are then less likely \nto require public assistance and more likely to avoid or escape \npoverty. This is a program that works.\n  The evidence is compelling. For example, in 2004, enforcement efforts \nhelped collect almost $22 billion in child support. Our aggressive \nState and Federal efforts have translated into $1 billion in collected \nchild support payments in Illinois alone this year. That means 386,000 \nIllinois families will be better equipped to provide for their \nchildren.\n  Preliminary budget estimates suggest the cuts proposed by the Ways \nand Means Committee will translate into $7.9 billion in lost \ncollections within 5 years, increasing to a loss of over $24 billion \nwithin 10 years. This proposal is not even pennywise, and it is \ncertainly pound foolish. Today, the State of Illinois reports a 32 \npercent child support collection rate. Let's not take a step backwards \nin the progress that has been made by stripping the States of necessary \nFederal support. Moreover, the welfare of too many is at stake. Child \nsupport is the second largest income source for qualifying low-income \nfamilies. We cannot balance our budget on the backs of families who \nrely on child support to remain out of poverty.\n  This Congress claims that strengthening the family is a priority. \nSenator Harkin's amendment is a firm expression that we are serious \nabout this worthwhile investment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Senator from Iowa has been kind enough \nto represent that he will accept a voice vote on this. I move that we \nproceed to a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2363.\n  The amendment (No. 2363) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the next item of business will be Senator \nByrd's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senator from Iowa set a very good \nexample. We encourage other Senators to follow that example.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2414\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for the suspension of the debate limitation on \n   reconciliation legislation that causes a deficit or increases the \n                                deficit)\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, my amendment will suspend the time \nlimitations on debate for reconciliation bills that increase the \ndeficit. The Congress will never succeed in balancing the budget, \ncutting the deficit, as long as the reconciliation process can be used \nto shield controversial tax-and-spending decisions from debate and \namendment. If Senators want to ensure offsets for deficit-increasing \nmeasures, then we must protect our rights to debate and amend within \nthe budget process. The more tax cuts that can be forced through now \nwithout offsets, the tougher the budget decisions and the worse the \npain in the coming months and years. The budget cuts that seem tough \nnow will grow enormous, and they will be unbearable, if tax cuts \ncontinue without offsets. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Harkin be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], for himself and \n     Mr. Harkin, proposes an amendment numbered 2414.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SUSPENSION OF DEBATE LIMITATION ON RECONCILIATION \n                   LEGISLATION THAT CAUSES A DEFICIT OR INCREASES \n                   THE DEFICIT.\n\n       (a) In General.--For purposes of consideration in the \n     Senate of any reconciliation bill or resolution, or \n     amendments thereto or debatable motions and appeals in \n     connection therewith, under section 310(e) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974, section 305(b) (1), (2), \n     and (5), section 305(c), and the limitation on debate in \n     section 310(e)(2) of that Act, shall not apply to any \n     reconciliation bill or resolution, amendment thereto, or \n     motion thereon that includes reductions in revenue or \n     increases in spending that would cause an on-budget deficit \n     to occur or increase the deficit for any fiscal year covered \n     by such bill or resolution.\n       (b) Germaneness Required.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), \n     no amendment that is not germane to the provisions of such \n     reconciliation bill or resolution shall be received.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the practical effect of this amendment \nwould be to essentially vitiate the reconciliation process. It would \nmean we would end up with an event that could be filibustered. The \nwhole purpose of reconciliation is to have a time limit and to get to a \nvote. Therefore, this amendment would undermine completely the concept \nof reconciliation which, as is hopefully going to be proven by this\n\n[[Page S12313]]\n\nbill and others, is a very constructive way to get legislation through \nthis institution and move forward with the business of the people.\n  Therefore, I make a point of order that the pending amendment \ncontains matter within the jurisdiction of the Committee on the Budget, \nand I raise a point of order against the amendment under section 306 of \nthe Budget Act.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I move to waive the act in connection with \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that votes on this \nand all further amendments be 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant Journal clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The next amendment is Senator Lautenberg's.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I have offered an amendment to ensure that people \nunderstand what they are signing up for when the new Medicare drug \nbenefit comes to life and that is beginning in 2006. There is such a \nmix of things that the recipient beneficiaries, I am sure, will be very \nconfused as to what the cost is going to be on the gap of coverage, \nwhether they have to pay it all out of their pockets. I want to make \nsure they understand what it is they are applying for and the pitfalls \nor the advantages thereof.\n  This is very simple. We ask them to sign a note when they apply for \nthe plan so that they are saying they are fully aware of the \nconsequences of their signature. This should be passed, Mr. President, \nbecause it helps the senior citizens understand what it is they are \ngetting into.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am sure this amendment is well-\nintentioned, as are all amendments from the Senator from New Jersey, \nbut essentially it creates an unnecessary level of paperwork for the \nenrollee in the plan, and in addition, as a practical matter, it enters \ninto a portion of the Medicare trust fund which we have not addressed \nin this reconciliation bill, which is the Part D section of the trust \nfund, that being the new drug program the theory being that program \nshould be allowed to get rolling before it gets amended.\n  There are a number of regulations coming out from CMS relative to \nmaking sure the beneficiaries are adequately protected under their \nplan, and I believe they pick up the issues that are raised by the \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  That being said, I make a point of order that the pending amendment \nis not germane to the measure now before the Senate, and I raise that \npoint of order under section 305 of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, pursuant to the relevant sections of \nthe Congressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive those sections \nfor consideration of the pending amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would simply announce that this is a 10-\nminute vote and it will be 10.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.

What is the will of the Senate? The Senator \nfrom North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask the Chair of the committee if it \nwould be appropriate now to go to the Cantwell amendment?\n  Mr. GREGG. Absolutely.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I direct my colleagues' attention to the \nCantwell amendment and indicate that we are now trying to make an \nanalysis of\n\n[[Page S12314]]\n\nwhere we are with respect to the funding of the bill, where we are with \nrespect to the requirements the Senate is under under reconciliation, \nto make certain that all of this fits together. That is the reason for \nthe delay at this moment, to make certain that the numbers work \ncorrectly.\n  With that, we will go to the Cantwell amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2400\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to offer a perfecting amendment. \nIn order to raise the $2.4 billion claimed in the underlying bill, it \nassumes a 50-50 split of oil leasing revenues between the State of \nAlaska and the Federal Treasury.\n  But my colleagues may be surprised to learn that whether or not this \n50-50 legislative language is upheld in court is a matter of some \nuncertainty. The State of Alaska has long maintained it is due 90 \npercent of these revenues, so instead of the Federal Government getting \n$2.4 billion, it would only get $480 million.\n  If you don't believe me, the State of Alaska just passed a resolution \nthis spring, saying it would insist on the 90-10 split. I ask my \ncolleagues to be faithful in telling the taxpayers the real story. \nLet's support maintaining the 50-50 and not moving forward until we are \ncertain that is $2.4 billion of revenue for the Federal Government.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this bill already contains the first \nportion of this amendment: Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \nthe existing law applies to this area of Alaska.\n  This is a vindictive amendment. It says if my State decides to pursue \na legal right that all production in ANWR would stop. There would be no \nfurther production. I don't understand this amendment because we have \nbeen a State since 1958. We have not filed that suit. That resolution \npassed the State legislature almost every year, and it is an act of the \nState legislature, but the Federal law governs this area and it says a \n50-50 split, which applies to all States.\n  I yield to the Senator from New Mexico what time we have left.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we had a very critical vote. You all \nlistened to it. This is nothing but an amendment to try to come in the \nback door and kill ANWR. It is absolutely wrong. We ought not even be \nconsidering it. The very same people who wanted to kill it for 30 years \nare making this last-ditch effort. The amendment should not even be on \nthe floor, and we ought to kill it. If it doesn't take 10 minutes we \nought to do it in 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Ms. Cantwell] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2400.\n\n  The amendment follows:\n\n       On page 101, strike lines 12 through 19 and insert the \n     following:\n       (d) Receipts.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, of the amount of adjusted bonus, rental, and royalty \n     receipts derived from oil and gas leasing and operations \n     authorized under this section--\n       (A) 50 percent shall be paid to the State of Alaska; and\n       (B) the balance shall be deposited into the Treasury as \n     miscellaneous receipts.\n       (2) Judicial review.--\n       (A) In general.--Any civil action brought by the State of \n     Alaska to compel an increase in the percentage of revenues to \n     be paid under paragraph (1) shall be filed not later than 90 \n     days after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (B) Limitation.--\n       (i) In general.--If a civil action is filed by the State of \n     Alaska under subparagraph (A), until such time as a final \n     nonappealable order is issued with respect to the civil \n     action and notwithstanding any other provision of law--\n\n       (I) production of oil and gas from the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge is prohibited;\n       (II) no action shall be taken to establish or implement the \n     competitive oil and gas leasing program authorized under this \n     title; and\n       (III) no leasing or other development leading to the \n     production of oil or gas from the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge shall be undertaken.\n\n       (ii) Final order.--If the court issues a final \n     nonappealable order with respect to a civil action filed \n     under subparagraph (A) that increases the percentage of \n     revenues to be paid to the State of Alaska--\n\n       (I) production of oil and gas from the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge is prohibited; and\n       (II) no leasing or other development leading to the \n     production of oil or gas from the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge shall be undertaken.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am thrilled that the Senate has agreed to \naccept by unanimous consent to the Budget Reconciliation Act, S. 1932, \na bipartisan amendment offered by Senator Specter and myself to \nallocate the extra $278,000,000 in revenue provided from the Judiciary \nCommittee markup on reconciliation to supplement funding for the \nBulletproof Vest Partnership, programs authorized by the Justice For \nAll Act, and the Copyright Royalty Judges Program.\n  I thank my good friend and colleague, Senator Specter, for his \nleadership on and commitment to seeing that these important programs \nare funded as much as we can during these tough fiscal times. As \nChairman and Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Specter \nand I have joined forces before to champion funding for these programs. \nI am privileged to partner with him again in that pursuit.\n  The Judiciary Committee markup on its reconciliation title provided \n$278,000,000 more in revenue than was mandated by the budget resolution \ninstructions. We now seek to include additional provisions within the \njurisdiction of our committee into the Senate reconciliation package. \nOur bipartisan amendment funds a number of Judiciary programs that \nenjoyed broad bipartisan support when Congress authorized them. These \nmandatory spending changes would simply spend some of the additional \nrevenue that we raised through increases in immigration fees during our \nmarkup.\n  Our proposal would provide $60,000,000 over the next 5 years for such \ninitiatives as the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Program, which helps \nlaw enforcement agencies purchase or replace body armor for their rank-\nand-file officers. Recently, concerns over body armor safety surfaced \nwhen a Pennsylvania police officer was shot and critically wounded \nthrough his new vest outfitted with a material called Zylon. The \nJustice Department has since announced that Zylon fails to provide the \nintended level of ballistic resistance. Unfortunately, an estimated \n200,000 vests outfitted with that material have been purchased--many \nwith Bulletproof Vest Partnership funds--and now must be replaced. Law \nenforcement agencies nationwide are struggling to find the funds \nnecessary to replace defective vests with ones that will actually stop \nbullets and save lives. Our amendment will help them replace those \nfaulty vests.\n  Our amendment also provides over $216,000,000 for programs authorized \nby the Justice For All Act of 2004, a landmark law that enhances \nprotections for victims of Federal crimes, increases Federal resources \navailable to State and local governments to combat crimes with DNA \ntechnology, and provides safeguards to prevent wrongful convictions and \nexecutions. The bipartisan amendment that Senator Specter and I propose \nwill, among other things, allow for training of criminal justice and \nmedical personnel in the use of DNA evidence, including evidence for \npost-conviction DNA testing. It will promote the use of DNA technology \nto identify missing persons. With these funds, State and local \nauthorities will be better able to implement and enforce crime victims' \nrights laws, including Federal victim and witness assistance programs. \nState and locals can apply for grants to develop and implement victim \nnotification systems so that they can share information on criminal \nproceedings in a timely and efficient manner. The amendment will also \nhelp improve the quality of legal representation provided to both \nindigent defendants and the public in State capital cases.\n\n  Last, but certainly not least, our amendment provides $6,500,000 over \n5 years for the Copyright Royalty Judges Program at the Library of \nCongress. The Copyright Royalty Distribution Reform Act of 2004 created \na new program in the Library to replace most of the current statutory \nresponsibilities of the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels program. \nThe Copyright Royalty Judges Program will determine distributions of \nroyalties that are disputed and will set or adjust royalty rates, terms \nand conditions, with the exception of satellite carriers' compulsory \nlicenses. Our amendment would help pay the salaries and related \nexpenses of the three royalty judges and three administrative staff \nrequired by law to support this program.\n  The Specter-Leahy amendment will give to programs that help protect \npolice officers and victims of violent crime, allow State and local \ngovernments to combat crimes with DNA technology, and provide \nsafeguards to prevent wrongful convictions and executions. Chairman \nSpecter and I are proud that the Judiciary Committee was able to agree \nto a reconciliation package that will provide $278 million more in \nrevenue than was mandated by the Budget Resolution instructions. I \nthank our colleagues for supporting our amendment and agreeing to use \nthat additional money to fund some of these important priorities that \ncontinue to lack adequate Federal resources.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2413\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of an amendment to \nS. 1932, the deficit reduction bill. I am pleased to be joined in this \nbipartisan effort with Senators Lieberman, Roberts, Durbin, and Allen. \nI am grateful to each of them for working closely with me in crafting \nthis amendment. In addition, I would like to thank Chairman Enzi and \nSenator Kennedy for working closely with me in support of this \namendment.\n  Under the deficit reduction bill, certain educational programs are \nauthorized or reauthorized that provide Federal dollars to help low-\nincome students with the costs associated with higher education. These \nprograms include: (1) Pell grants--in fiscal year 2005 $12.787 billion \nwas spent on Pell grants by the Federal Government; (2) ProGAP grants--\na new mandatory spending program consisting of approximately $1.45 \nbillion a year that is designed to provide supplemental grants to low-\nincome Pell grant recipients, regardless of their majors; and (3) SMART \ngrants--a new mandatory spending program consisting of $450 million a \nyear that is designed to provide supplemental grants to low-income Pell \ngrant recipients in their third and fourth year of college who are \npursuing majors in math, science, engineering, and foreign languages.\n  These initiatives are commendable. I support them. Each program will \nsignificantly increase dollars targeted to low-income individuals who \nwish to pursue higher education to help them with the costs associated \nwith their schooling.\n  But while I support these programs, I also fervently believe that \nwhen the Congress expends taxpayer money, it ought to do so in a manner \nthat meets our Nation's needs.\n  The fact of the matter is that should this bill become law, the \nFederal Government will spend, next year alone, approximately $14.5 \nbillion on grants to help low-income students attend higher education. \nI repeat $14.5 billion.\n  Of this $14.5 billion, though, without this amendment, only $450 \nmillion each year will be specifically targeted towards encouraging \nstudents to enter courses of study that are critical to our national \nsecurity. That amounts to only about 3 percent of the total amount \nspent. I repeat, 3 percent. That is astonishing to me.\n  It is astonishing to me because a key component of America's \nnational, homeland, and economic security in the post 9/11 world of \nglobal terrorism is having home-grown, highly-trained scientific minds \nto compete in today's one-world market. Yet alarmingly,\n\n[[Page S12317]]\n\nAmerica faces a huge shortage of these technical minds.\n  Strikingly, America faced a similar situation nearly 50 years ago. On \nOctober 4, 1957, the Soviet Union successfully launched the first \nmanmade satellite--Sputnik--into space. The launch shocked America, as \nmany of us had assumed that we were preeminent in the scientific \nfields. While prior to that unforgettable day America enjoyed an air of \npost World War II invincibility, afterwards our Nation recognized that \nthere was a cost to its complacency. We had fallen behind.\n  In the months and years to follow, we would respond with massive \ninvestments in science, technology and engineering.\n  In 1958, Congress passed the National Defense Education Act to \ninspire and induce individuals to advance in the fields of science and \nmath. In addition, President Eisenhower signed into law legislation \nthat established the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, \nNASA. And a few years later, in 1961, President Kennedy set the \nNation's goal of landing a man on the Moon within the decade.\n  These investments paid off. In the years following the Sputnik \nlaunch, America not only closed the scientific and technological gap \nwith the Soviet Union, we surpassed them. Our renewed commitment to \nscience and technology not only enabled us to safely land a man on the \nMoon in 1969, it spurred research and development which helped ensure \nthat our modern military has always had the best equipment and \ntechnology in the world. These post-Sputnik investments also laid the \nfoundation for the creation of some of the most significant \ntechnologies of modern life, including personal computers, and the \nInternet.\n  Why is any of this important to us today? Because as the old saying \ngoes: he or she who fails to remember history is bound to repeat it.\n  The truth of the matter is that today America's education system is \ncoming up short in training the highly technical American minds that we \nnow need and will continue to need far into the future.\n  The fact is that over the last two decades the number of young \nAmericans pursuing bachelor degrees in science and engineering has been \ndeclining. In fact, the proportion of college-age students earning \ndegrees in math, science, and engineering is now substantially higher \nin 16 countries in Asia and Europe than it is in the United States. If \nthese current trends continue, then, according to the National Science \nBoard, less than 10 percent of all scientists and engineers in the \nworld will be working in America by 2010.\n  This shortage in America of highly trained, technical minds is \nalready having very real consequences for us as a country. For example, \nthe U.S. production of patents, probably the most direct link between \nresearch and economic benefit, has declined steadily relative to the \nrest of the world for decades, and now stands at only 52 percent of the \ntotal.\n\n  In the past, this country has been able to compensate for its \nshortfall in homegrown, highly trained, technical and scientific talent \nby importing the necessary brain power from foreign countries. However, \nwith increased global competition, this is becoming harder and harder. \nMore and more of our imported brain power is returning home to their \nnative countries. And regrettably, as they return home, many American \nhigh-tech jobs are being outsourced with them.\n  Simply put, in today's one world market, while we in America are \nsleeping at night, the other half of the world is thinking and \ncontriving of every possible way to compete against us economically. \nMoreover, while we are sleeping at night, there are persons in this \nworld who are awake, working hard in support of efforts aimed at taking \nour security and our freedoms away from us.\n  Fortunately, we can do something here today to help us become better \nprepared. Certainly, the SMART grant program is an important step in \nthe right direction. But while the SMART grant program is one small \nstep for man, it is not a giant leap for America. More has to be done. \nRemember, even with the SMART grant program, next year only 3 percent \nof the $14.5 billion targeted towards low-income students will be \nfocused on meeting our security needs.\n  That is why I am offering this amendment today. The Warner, \nLieberman, Roberts, Durbin, and Allen amendment is simple. It simply \nallows the Secretary of Education to provide to low-income Pell grant \nrecipients who pursue majors at the college and university level in \ncritical national and homeland security fields of math, science, \nengineering, and foreign languages, an additional sum of money on top \nof their normal ProGAP grants. The amendment gives incentives and \ninducements to students who accept the challenge of pursuing the more \nrigorous and demanding curriculum of these studies that are critical to \nour Nation.\n  The amendment achieves its goal without adding a single new dollar to \nthe underlying bill.\n  The Warner, Lieberman, Roberts, Durbin, and Allen amendment does not \nchange the Pell grant program or the SMART grant program in any way. It \nmerely changes the formula of payments to students who will receive \nProGAP grants. This change is desperately needed to put our nation on \nthe road to meeting the ever increasing competition from India, China, \nand other nations where more and more of their students are pursuing \nstudies in the scientific area.\n  The amendment builds upon the SMART grant program by enabling the \nSecretary to provide even greater incentives to encourage individuals \nto pursue studies critical fields. The amendment accomplishes this goal \nby allowing the Secretary of Education to award larger ProGAP grants to \nstudents majoring in programs of math, science, engineering and foreign \nlanguages that are key to our national and homeland security.\n  While I believe studying the liberal arts is an important component \nto having an enlightened citizenry, we simply must do more to address \nthis glaring shortage in other critical fields.\n  America can ill afford a 21st century Sputnik. This amendment will \nmake sure that additional monies get focused on training the highly \nskilled minds that are needed in the 21st century to protect our \nnational, economic, and homeland security.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, this amendment modifies the way retail \npharmacies are paid for brand-name generic drugs under Medicaid. The \nunderlying bill makes some important, positive changes but has the \nunintended consequence of forcing the independents--that is, the \nindependent drugstores and the chains--in a disadvantaged position \ncompared with mail-order drug companies and long-term care drug \ncompanies, the point being that the last category, because they are \nlarge-sized, have greater purchasing power to be able to acquire drugs \non a discount basis, whereas the earlier category, the independent \npharmacist and the chains themselves who do not have the same \npurchasing power, will be forced to pay higher prices compared to the \nlarger. It is a complicated subject.\n  This is an amendment designed to even the playing field so the \nsmaller guys get a break. It will not be to the disadvantage of the \nlarger guys, because with their larger size, they will be able to get \ndiscounts that will more than offset the amendment provided for the \nsmaller guys.\n  Mr. GREGG.

The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer], for himself and \n     Mr. Rockefeller, proposes an amendment numbered 2348.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To strike the provisions increasing the Medicaid rebate for \n                             generic drugs)\n\n       On page 125, strike lines 3 through 14.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I will speak for a moment about the \nSchumer-Rockefeller generics amendment to the budget reconciliation \nbill.\n  The amendment that Senator Schumer and I are offering today would \neliminate the provision in this bill that increases the generics \nMedicaid rebate from 11 percent to 17 percent. Increasing the rebate \nfor generics would jeopardize consumer access to lower-cost \nprescription drugs and that's why this provision needs to be stricken \nfrom this bill.\n\n[[Page S12319]]\n\n  The reconciliation bill before us has a number of flaws--it cuts \nMedicaid by $7.5 billion despite Hurricane Katrina and the high health \ncare costs working families continue to face. It imposes even greater \npremiums on Medicare beneficiaries when Part B premiums have already \ngone up by more than $10 per month in each of the last 2 years. And, it \nfails to address many of the problems we know will occur when the \nMedicare drug benefit is implemented on January 1, 2006. But, that's \nnot all.\n  This bill also includes a provision--which was added to the Finance \nCommittee reconciliation bill the night before the markup--that would \nincrease the rebate amount that generic manufacturers pay to State \nMedicaid programs from 11 percent to 17 percent. That's an increase of \n55 percent.\n  At a time when access to generic drugs represents the greatest \nopportunity for prescription drug cost savings, this bill seeks to \nlimit such access. Not only will this policy result in greater costs to \nMedicaid over the long term, but it could also threaten access to \nlower-cost drugs for all Americans.\n  In the recent past, when Missouri and New Jersey considered \nimplementing generic drug rebate increases for the purpose of achieving \nsavings, they actually found they would have incurred greater costs as \na result of reduced access to affordable generic drugs.\n  New Jersey officials estimated that increasing rebates on generics \nused in their Pharmaceutical Assistance for the Aged and Disabled and \nSenior Gold programs would have increased state costs $18 million in \nthe first year. Missouri's SeniorRx Program estimated that increasing \ngeneric rebates would have increased state costs by $8.5 million \ndollars in the first year alone.\n  According to a 1998 study by the Congressional Budget Office, generic \ndrugs save consumers approximately $8-10 billion each year. Why would \nwe undercut access to generics when low-cost prescription drugs should \nbe a priority?\n  I question the merits of such a far-reaching policy that was added in \nthe dead of night seemingly for the purpose of achieving greater budget \nsavings. I understand the temptation to act in reconciliation to \naccomplish longstanding policy goals as well as to address requests \nfrom special interest groups.\n  We should resist such temptation when we have not done our homework--\nwhen we don't know the real rationale or effects of this policy or the \ninteraction with other policies. We can do better.\n  We can be more thoughtful--and we have a responsibility to be very \ncareful when we're dealing with pocketbook issues that affect working \nfamilies, our states, as well as long-term costs to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I thank the Chair and urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the \nSchumer-Rockefeller generic drug amendment.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. In a \nsincere effort to cut costs, what has happened in this bill is, in \neffect, we have eliminated the ability of generic drugs to be sold \nusing Medicaid. That will raise costs dramatically.\n  Over half the prescription drugs used in Medicaid are generic. They \nare only 16 percent of the cost, but because we have raised the fees so \ndramatically on what a generic drug company must pay a pharmacy to \nhandle the drug, it is now going to be the same as a prescription drug. \nEven though the prescription drug costs a whole lot more and, \ntherefore, it is a much lower base, pharmacies are not going to use the \ngeneric. In the long run, that will cost the Medicaid Program billions \nof dollars.\n  This is a huge mistake. It was not done by design. They raised all \nthe fees and figured that will bring this amount of money in the next \nyear.\n  Can anyone imagine we are saying, in Medicaid, where we need to save \nmoney, we are not going to use generic drugs? My amendment corrects \nthat situation and is within the fiscal confines of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we do not need an amendment to improve \nthis situation because this bill has in it already very significant \nincentives for generic utilization through the way we reimburse \ngenerics and the dispensing fee we require.\n  A very significant thing is to remember that brand drugs account for \n67 percent of Medicaid prescriptions, but they also account for 81 \npercent of the Medicaid rebates. This is reasonable policy for us, \nthen, to create parity between brand and generic rebates. This \namendment would upset that parity.\n  The amendment before the Senate also simply strikes generic rebates; \nit does not pay for it. So I strongly oppose bringing the Committee on \nFinance out of compliance with our budget instructions. This amendment \nwould do that. I ask Members to oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the significance of Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac to our economy cannot be overstated. Together they guarantee almost \n46 percent of all mortgage loans in the United States. They also back \nover $3.9 trillion in mortgage-backed securities and have amassed over \n$1.7 trillion in outstanding debt. This amendment would require Fannie \nand Freddie to register their debt in securities with the Securities \nand Exchange Commission, like any other company. Both are currently \nexempt from having to do so and, because of this, both are exempt from \nthe accounting requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley. The Senate Banking \nCommittee, under the leadership of Chairman Shelby, passed a \ncomprehensive, strong, GSE regulatory reform bill earlier this year. We \nneed to take this bill up in this Congress.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 2391, Withdrawn\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Sununu be allowed to speak for 1 \nminute, after which I ask that amendment No. 2391 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I join the Senator from Nebraska in \nsupporting this amendment. We absolutely need strong, credible, \neffective regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These are enormous, \ncomplex financial institutions. We want to ensure their safety and \nsoundness. We want to ensure they stay focused on their chartered \nmission, which is to provide liquidity in our secondary mortgage \nmarket. It sends the wrong message if we treat them differently from \nother big investment services companies. It sends the wrong message if \nwe don't have a credible regulator. We need to pass legislation that \nincludes this kind of a provision, SEC registration for their stocks \nand bonds. It is common sense. We have passed legislation in the \nBanking Committee that is increasingly unlikely, given the opposition, \nlack of cooperation of the GSEs in working on this legislation. Their \nallied interest groups have weighed in against the legislation. I think \nit does a disservice to the capital markets and to the consumers if we \nfail to have a strong, credible regulator. I certainly support the \namendment, but I will yield back to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the only amendments remaining \nin order be two by Senator Reed, one by Senator Lieberman, one by \nSenator Santorum, and one by Senator Snowe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my personal capacity as a Senator from \nTexas, I object.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Chair objects.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Chair objects.\n  Mr. GREGG. And one by Senator Cornyn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the last \none is a Cornyn amendment?\n  Mr. GREGG. It appears there may be.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think we can accept it.\n  Mr. GREGG. We will now go to Senator Santorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2419\n\n  (Purpose: To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to make a \n  technical correction regarding purchase agreements for power-driven \n  wheelchairs under the Medicare program, to provide for coverage of \n  ultrasound screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms under part B of \n  such program, to improve patient access to, and utilization of, the \ncolorectal cancer screening benefit under such program, and to provide \n for the coverage of marriage and family therapist services and mental \n         health counselor services under part B of such title)\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum], for himself, \n     Mr. Bunning, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n     Dodd, and Mr. Rockefeller, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2419.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, this is a four-part amendment. The first \npart would provide for a screening for aortic aneurysms, offered by \nSenator Bunning and Senator Dodd. The second part of the amendment \nwould allow for the purchase of electronic mobility equipment for our \nseniors, something Senator Voinovich has been working on, as opposed to \nhaving a long-term lease. The third part is offered by Senator Thomas, \nwhich has to do with rural mental health care under Medicare. And \nfinally, the piece I have been offering is on colorectal screenings. We \npassed that benefit back in 1997. As a result of that payment of the \nbenefit for screenings, we have only seen a 1-percent increase in \nscreenings. This is an attempt to try to increase that by allowing for \nthe payment of the pre-doctor visit as well as the part B deductible.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Landrieu as a cosponsor of the \namendment.\n\n[[Page S12321]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be listed as a \ncosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask for a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2419.\n  The amendment (No. 2419) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and to lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. We now go to Senator Reed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2409\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask that amendment No. 2409 be called up \nfor immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. REED], for himself, Mr. \n     Baucus, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Corzine, \n     Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Obama, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2409.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To strike provisions relating to reforms of targeted case \n                              management)\n\n       Strike section 6031 of the bill.\n\n  Mr. REED. This amendment strikes section 6031 of the reconciliation \nact which pertains to case management services. States have the ability \nto identify groups such as children and adults with AIDS, children in \nfoster care, other vulnerable groups, and find comprehensive services. \nThese services include educational and social as well as medical \nservices. The underlying reconciliation bill will force these services \nto be paid for by third parties, the State or others. That will \ndecrease the use of these services and actually end up costing more to \nthe States, and it will disrupt many of the very appropriate programs \nwe have. In fact, many of these programs save money by dealing with \nthese people.\n  I would point out that this legislation does not require an offset, \nnor does it require a supermajority vote since we are striking language \nin the underlying bill.\n  I reserve any time I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am shocked anybody from the other side \nof the aisle would raise any questions against the policy we have in \nour bill. This is not a Republican policy. This is not a Bush \nadministration policy. This is a policy that was offered by the \nprevious administration, the Clinton administration. The targeted case \nmanagement provision of this bill merely codifies that policy that was \noffered by the Clinton administration. I have a letter I got from the \nU.S. Psychiatric Rehabilitation Association expressing thanks for the \ntargeted case management provisions:\n\n       Your measured steps and considerations of TCM will preserve \n     the needed services to those who cannot attain housing, \n     employment, or health care on their own. [We] appreciate your \n     work in helping to ensure that mentally disabled Americans \n     have the opportunity to access Medicaid services.\n\n  It seems to me this is something that ought to be of the heart and \nthe brain of anybody on the other side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island has 7 seconds.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this bill will hurt programs that exist \ntoday that help children, people with AIDS, a host of people. I \nreceived this information not from the Clinton administration but from \nproviders in my own community, Christian Brothers who deal with \nchildren, social workers who deal with adults.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Smith \nbe added to the list of amendments that will be considered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object, we don't yet know what the \nSmith amendment is. Can we get that first?\n  Mr. GREGG. I withdraw that.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2409.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Oklahoma (Mr. Coburn).\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Corzine) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, a very important provision is being \npassed in this year's reconciliation bill establishing Medicare Value-\nBased Purchasing Programs. Value-based purchasing brings a pay-for-\nperformance provision to Medicare. Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus \nand the Finance Committee staff on both sides of the aisle have pushed \nforward an initiative that has been needed for a long time in American \nhealth care. I applaud them for their efforts.\n  A recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found \nthat less than 55 percent of patients in America receive appropriate \nmedical care. This means that if you go to the doctor and have \npneumonia there is a good chance you may not receive the right \nantibiotic; or CPR might be performed on a patient with the incorrect \nnumber of breaths; or you may not receive the best surgery for your \nheart condition. Americans are not systematically receiving appropriate \nmedical treatment. And receiving appropriate medical treatment should \nnot be a matter of luck.\n  We know that it is too easy for Americans to get inappropriate \nmedical care. But there are patient groups throughout our country that \nare in even more medical danger. Disparities in health care quality in \nminority groups are well documented. This would mean that a Hispanic or \nAfrican-American male is less likely to receive the right medication \nfor a heart condition than a White male. These findings are not related \nto income, insurance status, age, or what hospital a person goes to, \namong other factors. Special attention must be paid to minority patient \ngroups in our current efforts to improve the quality of medical care in \nthe U.S.\n  The 2003 Institute of Medicine report, Unequal Treatment, recommended \nthat the ``collection, reporting, and monitoring of patient care data \nby health plans and federal, and state payors should be encouraged'' to \nmove towards eliminating health disparities.\n  My amendment to section 6110 S. 1932 addresses this IOM \nrecommendation to more specifically encourage the collection and \nreporting of health care quality data for both majority and minority \ngroups as Medicare Value-Based Purchasing Programs are being developed \nand established.\n  My amendment encourages the Secretary of the Department of Health and \nHuman Services to focus on diseases where there are disparities between \nmajority and minority groups. Diseases such as infant mortality, \ndiabetes, heart disease, breast cancer, cervical cancer, HIV/AIDS, \nchildhood immunizations, and adult immunizations are all \ndisproportionately problematic in minority patient groups. They must be \nconsidered in any systematic attempt to measure and improve health care \nquality.\n  My amendment also encourages the collection of specific data on \npatient characteristics that are key to measuring and collecting data \non health care quality. Collecting information on gender, race/\nethnicity, language spoken, and insurance status are encouraged. \nWithout this information, we will not have any way of knowing whether \nor not disparities between majority and minority groups are decreasing.\n  In the existing provisions of section 6110, the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services will work with various expert \ngroups in development and implementing quality measurement systems. \nHowever, experts in minority health are not currently included in the \nlegislation. My amendment ensures that experts in minority health will \nbe included in developing and implementing a health care quality \nmeasurement system.\n  Lastly, my amendment would reward hospitals, physicians, clinics, and \nhome health care providers, among other groups that demonstrate \nimprovement in quality of care for patient subgroups and minorities.\n  I thank Senators Grassley and Baucus and the Finance Committee staff \nfor working with us to try to focus necessary attention on the health \ncare needs of all Americans. This would mark the first time our Federal \nGovernment made a commitment to improving the quality of health care \nthat minority groups--our constituents--are receiving. I believe this \ngroundbreaking legislation to bring pay-for-performance accountability \nto Medicare is an important step forward and I believe it will be much \nmore powerful and have much greater impact if we tackle how to \neliminate racial and ethnic disparities in health care.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we now turn to Senator Reed for his second \namendment.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2396.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2396.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To strike subtitle C of title II relating to FHA asset \n                              disposition)\n\n       On page 86, strike line 22 and all that follows through \n     page 90, line 19.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, my amendment would restore the ability of \nHUD to preserve and rehabilitate affordable housing.\n  The FHA upfront grant and below-market sales programs are designed to \nhelp local governments purchase FHA foreclosed multifamily properties \nin order to preserve and rehabilitate these units into affordable \nhousing.\n  Currently, the money for this program comes from the FHA General \nInsurance Fund, not from appropriations. This gives HUD significant \nflexibility in providing these funds if the need arises.\n  The proposal before us today will restrict HUD from using the FHA \nGeneral Insurance Fund to support both the below-market sales program \nand the upfront grant program. It is a program of about $50 million a \nyear.\n  My amendment would strike the language prohibiting the use of these \nfunds to allow them the flexibility to continue this program. Because \nit strikes language, no supermajority vote is necessary, and no offset \nis necessary.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Reed \namendment. In the Banking Committee, as part of the reconciliation \nprocess, we save, in this instance, $270 million. This proposal simply \nmakes the FHA's use of rehab grants and below-market sales subject to \nappropriations.\n  If these programs are, in fact, beneficial--some of them are--\nappropriations can still be granted in the future, and using the \nappropriations process allows the Congress to better oversee the use of \nthese dollars and to ensure that our resources are well spent.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. This $270 million is a \nlot of savings that we can put forth today.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee).

The amendment I am offering authorizes $450 million for \nState demonstration projects to provide Medicaid coverage to low-income \nindividuals living with HIV. It is similar to S. 311, Early Treatment \nfor HIV Act. I introduced this earlier this year with strong support of \n33 of my colleagues. As Medicaid generally covers only those disabled \nby full-blown AIDS, the amendment would vastly improve the treatment \navailable to some of our most vulnerable citizens.\n  With more States having difficulty maintaining their AIDS drug \nassistance program, it is imperative that we provide alternative \nmethods of delivering treatment to those individuals with HIV who are \nliving in poverty. It is simply the right thing to do. I ask for my \ncolleagues' support for this fiscally and morally defensible policy.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask for a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nClinton be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am offering this amendment on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Wyden, who has offered considerable leadership on \nthis issue over the years providing affordable medications to our \nseniors, along with Senator McCain and Senator Stabenow. So many of us \nin Congress have worked to make prescription drug coverage a part of \nthe Medicare Program, but the fact remains that the costs are rising \nsince the time we first created this program, from $523 billion to now \nup to $720 billion for the Part D Program.\n  As we see in this first chart, the brand-named prices are \nconsistently outpacing inflation because they have no competition. As \nwe can see with the generic drugs, where there is competition, the \nprice is lower. We want to give the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices the ability to negotiate prices, particularly for those \nseniors who will not have access to more than two prescription drug \nplans or where the plans ask for negotiating authority.\n  This is not price setting. This is price saving. In fact, we have \nexplicit language in the legislation that says this is not about price \nsetting. It does not give the Secretary that authority. It allows him \nto save money for the Part D Program that is expected and projected to \nincrease in cost by more than 8.5 percent as called for by the \nCongressional Budget Office. That is the CBO's very own numbers.\n  Finally, 80 percent of seniors in America have called for the \nSecretary to have this authority.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for \namendment No. 2371 offered by Senators Snowe and Wyden, which I am \npleased to cosponsor. The amendment ensures that the Health and Human \nServices, HHS Secretary has an active role in managing the costs of the \nnewly-created Medicare prescription drug program, part D, by striking \nlanguage in the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 that prohibits the \nHHS Secretary from using the bulk purchasing power of the Federal \nGovernment to obtain prescription drugs at the lowest possible cost to \ntaxpayers.\n  On the eve of the vote on the final Medicare bill, my colleague \nSenator Wyden and I agreed that this prohibition language, also \nreferred to as ``the noninterference clause,'' was a major flaw in the \noverall bill. Although we both voted in favor of the bill because it \nafforded seniors and the disabled the first-ever opportunity to \nvoluntarily sign up for a drug benefit in Medicare, we agreed to work \nto repeal this prohibition language in the bill. I have been pleased to \njoin with Senators Snowe and Wyden on legislation the past two \nCongresses to do just that.\n  Since casting my vote on the final Medicare bill which, at the time, \nI believed was for a $400 billion bill, we have all learned that more \naccurate estimates of the cost of the overall bill were withheld from \nCongress and that the true cost of the bill will now exceed $720 \nbillion over the next 10 years. Now, more than ever, Congress must do \neverything it can to ensure that the government and taxpayer dollars \nare getting the best deal out there on the cost of drugs covered by \nMedicare.\n  That is what this amendment will do. The amendment strikes the so-\ncalled ``noninterference'' clause, gives the HHS Secretary authority to \nnegotiate prices with drug manufacturers, and requires that the HHS \nSecretary do so for covered part D drugs for each fallback prescription \ndrug plan--plans where the Federal Government is assuming the risk--and \nupon the request of an approved prescription drug plan or a medicare \nadvantage prescription drug plan.\n  What the amendment does not do is require the Secretary to set drug \nprices or formularies. I have heard the argument that this amendment \nwill result in price controls. That argument has been made time and \ntime again by drug companies who would rather profit from the Federal \nGovernment paying too much for drugs than allow the Federal Government \nto use its purchasing power to negotiate for the best deals on drug \nprices.\n  The reality is that this amendment specifically states that the \nSecretary may not require a particular formulary or institute a price \nstructure for the reimbursement of covered part D drugs.\n  I have also heard the argument that the Secretary won't be able to \nnegotiate better drug prices than private plans currently do. I come \nfrom a State with the largest purchasing power in the country for drugs \nin its Medicaid program and it is clear that the size of California's \nmarket has helped California's ability to negotiate more competitive \ndrug prices in Medicaid.\n  But don't take my word for it. In 2004, CBO stated, ``giving the \nSecretary an additional tool--the authority to negotiate prices with \nmanufacturers of such drugs--would put greater pressure on those \nmanufacturers and could produce some additional savings.'' With respect \nto sole source drugs, CBO went on to say, ``there is potential for some \nsavings if the Secretary were to have the authority to negotiate prices \nwith manufacturers of single-source drugs that do not face competition \nfrom therapeutic alternatives.''\n  Prescription drug prices for existing drugs--these are not new drugs, \nbut old ones--have been rising at two to three times the inflation \nrates, according to the Government Accountability Office. So I ask the \nquestion: Why are we not doing everything in our power to ensure the \nFederal Government is getting the lowest prices for drugs?\n  The Snowe-Wyden amendment ensures fiscal responsibility in an \nentitlement program whose escalating costs pose a very serious problem \nfor future generations. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this \namendment and urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. SNOWE. The former Secretary of HHS said: I would like to have had \nthe opportunity to negotiate.\n  Let us give this power to the Secretary to save money for the program \nand to save money for seniors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield to the Senator from Iowa.\n\n[[Page S12325]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the fact is that the Government does not \nnegotiate prices, it sets prices. The second thing is that we set in \nplace in the Medicare bill plans to negotiate prices, and we know now \nfrom experience, and I did not know it when this amendment was offered \nbefore, that these plans are negotiating prices that are much lower for \nbeneficiaries and the taxpayers than we even anticipated when we passed \nthe bill 2 years ago.\n  One thing that ought to be taken into consideration is the fact that \nthere is no savings from this amendment. I would like to quote from The \nWashington Post, February 17: Governments are notoriously bad for \nsetting prices, and the U.S. Government is notoriously bad at setting \nprices in the medical realm.\n  We need to defeat this amendment as we defeated it a few months ago.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Kerry and Senator \nDodd as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the amendment is not germane to the \nmeasure before the Senate so I raise a point of order under section 305 \nof the Budget Act.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I move to waive that.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Corzine) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

What we are \nbeing asked to do here, what the taxpayers are being asked to suffer is \na transfer of money from their pocket basically to the living rooms of \nthe television-watching public so we can transition from analog to \ndigital TV. But to make things even more ironic, what this $3 billion \nis supposed to do is to provide converters so they can take the digital \nsignal and transition it back to the analog and reverse the action of \nthis Congress. It makes no sense. We can do better than this.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask for a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded back, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2408) was rejected.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. At this point, I believe the Senator from North Dakota has \nan amendment to offer.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2422\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I call up amendment 2422.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The Journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad], for himself and \n     Mr. Salazar, proposes an amendment numbered 2422.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To ensure Medicaid enrollees have access to small, \n      independent pharmacies located in rural and frontier areas)\n\n       On page 121, after line 25, add the following:\n       ``(5) Rules applicable to critical access retail \n     pharmacies.--\n       ``(A) Reimbursement limits.--Notwithstanding paragraph \n     (2)(A), in the case of a critical access retail pharmacy (as \n     defined in subparagraph (C)), the upper payment limit--\n       ``(i) for the ingredient cost of a single source drug, is \n     the lesser of--\n\n       ``(I) 108 percent of the average manufacturer price for the \n     drug; or\n       ``(II) the wholesale acquisition cost for the drug; and\n\n       ``(ii) for the ingredient cost of a multiple source drug, \n     is the lesser of--\n\n       ``(II) 140 percent of the weighted average manufacturer \n     price for the drug; or\n       ``(II) the wholesale acquisition cost for the drug.\n\n       ``(B) Application of other provisions.--The preceding \n     provisions of this subsection shall apply with respect to \n     reimbursement to a critical access retail pharmacy in the \n     same manner as such provisions apply to reimbursement to \n     other retail pharmacies except that, in establishing the \n     dispensing fee for a critical access pharmacy the Secretary, \n     in addition to the factors required under paragraph (4), \n     shall include consideration of the costs associated with \n     operating a critical access retail pharmacy.\n       ``(C) Critical access retail pharmacy defined.--For \n     purposes of subparagraph (A), the term `critical access \n     retail pharmacy' means an retail pharmacy that is not within \n     a 20-mile radius of another retail pharmacy.''.\n       (2) Increase in basic rebate for single source drugs and \n     innovator multiple source drugs.--Section \n     1927(c)(1)(B)(i)(VI) (42 U.S.C. 1396r-8(c)(1)(B)(i)(VI), as \n     added by section 6002(a)(3), is amended by striking ``17'' \n     and inserting ``18.1''.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, in the interest of time, very briefly, \nthis is to help rural remote pharmacies with modestly enhanced \nreimbursement. I very much thank my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle who have agreed to support this amendment. I especially thank the \nchairman of the Finance Committee for his support.\n\n[[Page S12326]]\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I urge the amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2422) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2392\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to reiterate my statement which was \ninadvertently omitted from yesterday's Record with regard to amendment \nNo. 2392 that we will support an effort to pass legislation to make the \ntechnical change deleted from our bill in a more appropriate vehicle.\n\n\n                        Pharmacy Dispensing Fees\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I engage my colleague, the Chairman of the \nSenate Finance Committee, in a colloquy about his intent regarding \nMedicaid pharmacy dispensing fees in the Medicaid pharmacy \nreimbursement reform section of the Budget Reconciliation Act.\n  As I understand the intent of these provisions, States are required \nto pay dispensing fees to pharmacies for Medicaid prescriptions, but \nthere are no specific minimum fees set forth in the bill. States are \ngiven some guidance regarding the factors to use when setting the fees, \nbut there are no requirements to do anything more than take those \nfactors into ``consideration'' when setting fees.\n  I am concerned that the States will not be able to accurately account \nfor these factors when setting these dispensing fees. As a consequence, \npharmacies will be paid significantly less for the drug product that \nthey provide to Medicaid recipients. This could make it difficult for \nMedicaid recipients to continue to obtain their prescription \nmedications from their neighborhood pharmacy, and many pharmacies may \nhave to close or reduce hours. The total payment to pharmacies for the \ndrug product and dispensing fee must be adequate to pay pharmacies to \nbuy the drug, dispense the medication, and have a reasonable return. It \nis my understanding that States would have to pay double or triple the \ndispensing fees currently being paid to he pharmacies just to break \neven.\n  I am also concerned that States do not have any guidance or direction \nin the bill on how to set their dispensing fees for generic drugs in \nrelation to brand name drugs. While the bill does say that States \nshould set dispensing fees for non innovator multiple source drugs \nhigher than innovator multiple source drugs that are therapeutically \nequivalent and bioequivalent, I urge that the language require that \nfees for generic drugs in general be set higher than fees for brand \nname drugs. This will encourage the dispensing of generic drugs which \ncan be one-fifth the cost of a brand name drug.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator for his concerns and want to \nclarify for him the intent of the bill regarding dispensing fees and \nrespond to some of his concerns. I agree that States will need to \nreview and increase the fees that they pay pharmacies for dispensing \nMedicaid prescriptions. We want to be sure that Medicaid recipients can \ncontinue to have access to prescription medications from their local \npharmacies. Coming from a rural State, I know that many of my \nconstituents rely on pharmacies for health care services and the \npharmacist may be the only health care professional for many miles.\n  The overall assumptions made in the bill is that States will increase \ntheir dispensing fees to account for the fact that States would \nprobably be paying pharmacists a lower amount for the drug product that \nmore accurately reflects the cost of the drug product that is being \ndispensed. The amount of the dispensing fee increase will depend on \nmany factors in each State.\n\n  We expect that each State will regularly undertake surveys of current \npharmacy dispensing costs to determine their dispensing fees, and that \nsuch costs would include those that are listed in the bill. States \nwould set their dispensing fees based on those surveys. We also expect \nthat States will pay pharmacies a reasonable return for dispensing \nMedicaid prescriptions.\n  Our expectation is that States will do all they can to encourage the \ndispensing of generic drugs in Medicaid. It is my expectation that \nStates will set significantly higher fees for generics than for brands, \nsuch as one and a half or twice the brand name fee. If an innovator \nmultiple source drug is less than or equal to the cost of a generic, \nthen the State should pay the generic dispensing fee for that drug.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chairman for his clarification regarding \ndispensing fees. I look forward to working with you as this process \nmoves forward to ensure that any reforms in the Medicaid pharmacy \npayment system will provide adequate reimbursement to pharmacies for \ndispensing Medicaid prescriptions since beneficiary access to \nlifesaving medications depends on pharmacies to dispense them.\n\n\n                            medicaid waivers\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Last month, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices--CMS, approved a comprehensive Section 1115 waiver for the \nState of Florida, the latest in a string of waivers that allows States \nto dramatically reshape the financing and entitlement guarantees \nestablished by law in the Medicaid program. These far-reaching Medicaid \nwaivers are generally negotiated in secret without input from the very \nbeneficiaries who would be affected by such drastic changes to the \nprogram. That is why I have filed an amendment to this budget \nreconciliation bill that will require CMS to post public notification \non their website within 5 business days whenever a State submits a \nwaiver concept paper for feedback or a formal waiver proposal for \ndiscussion and review.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Senator Rockefeller, I share your concerns about the \nSection 1115 waivers recently negotiated by CMS and several States, \nincluding Florida and Vermont. I am also concerned about pending \nwaivers being negotiated in South Carolina, Kentucky, Georgia and West \nVirginia. Medicaid is a joint Federal-State partnership in all \nrespects, including its financing, and both Congress and beneficiaries \nshould be aware of the extent to which CMS is negotiating waivers with \nStates that modify the Federal-State financing relationship or the \nFederal guarantee of health benefits. CMS has taken several steps to \nimprove the waiver information available on its website since early \n2002. However, as you pointed out at the Finance Committee hearing last \nweek, CMS does not post notification on their website when they have \nreceived formal or informal communication from a State regarding a \nwaiver and the ``State Waiver Programs and Demonstrations'' portion of \nthe website is not updated by CMS on a regular basis.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Senator Grassley, I think it is more than just a question \nof transparency. It is also a question of legality. In many cases, the \ncontent of the waivers that CMS is negotiating fundamentally alters the \nFederal guarantee of Medicaid benefits. This is not the intended \npurpose of Medicaid demonstration authority. Section 1115 waiver \nauthority allows the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human \nServices to waive certain provisions of the Medicaid program if the \nchanges are determined to ``promote the objectives'' of Medicaid. I am \nconcerned that the current waivers being approved by CMS go well beyond \nCMS' authority and that Congress should be more vigilant in its \noversight.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Senator Baucus, I certainly appreciate your views on \nthis issue. You and I have worked hard over the last couple of years to \nimprove Medicaid waiver transparency, and I think we have made some \nprogress. But, I understand your desire to do more. I want to continue \nworking with you to ensure that the Senate Finance Committee fulfills \nits oversight obligation in this area. I also think that the Medicaid \nwaiver amendment that Senator Rockefeller is offering has merit, and I \nwould like to continue working with him to improve the waiver \ninformation available on CMS' website.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Chairman Grassley, I thank you for your willingness \nto work with me. This is a matter of good government. The Government \nAccountability Office has published several reports which indicate that \nthe Department of Health and Human Services has failed to follow its \nown policy on providing opportunities for the public to learn about and \ncomment on pending waiver requests. Congress has a responsibility to \nassert its oversight authority on Section 1115 waivers because Medicaid \nis too important a program to allow it to be waived\n\n[[Page S12327]]\n\naway through secret negotiations and without input from those who will \nbe affected or their advocates.\n\n\n           medicaid pharmacy, reimbursement for prescriptions\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. Chairman, I applaud your leadership on the \nMedicare and Medicaid portion of this reconciliation package and am \ncommitted to working with you to achieve reductions in mandatory \nspending programs under your jurisdiction as instructed in the \ncongressional budget resolution. I believe that it is necessary to \nmaintain fiscal constraint and recognize the difficult task involved in \nachieving that end while ensuring that the country's health care safety \nnet remains available for our citizens who truly need it the most.\n  As we move forward in advancing that goal, I understand that there \nare several changes included in the reconciliation package being \nconsidered today that address Medicaid pharmacy reimbursement for \nprescription drugs dispensed in the pharmacy setting. I know you and \nyour staff worked very hard to craft the Medicaid provisions contained \nin this legislation and that we both share the common goal of ensuring \nthat Medicaid beneficiaries continue to have access to cost-effective \nprescription drugs reimbursed at an appropriate rate.\n  In that light, I understand that it is not your intent to \ninadvertently disrupt the highly efficient drug distribution system \nresponsible for assuring access to needed drugs across the Nation's \npharmacies. I think we both believe that the drug distribution system \ncan best be preserved if prompt-pay discounts paid to distributors are \nexcluded from the new Medicaid pharmacy reimbursement methodology. Was \nthis the Chairman's intention?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I do recognize the valuable role drug distributors play \nin the delivery of prescription medication and our Nation's health care \nand did intend to exclude prompt pay discounts from the methodology.\n  I say to my colleague from Ohio that I will work with him to ensure \nthat my intention to exclude the discounts is preserved through the \nconference and enacted into law.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I thank the chairman and look forward to working with \nhim in this effort. I know he agrees with me that Congress should not \nestablish a Medicaid pharmaceutical reimbursement system that might \ndiscourage manufacturers from paying distributors prompt-pay discounts \nif wholesalers pay their bill prior to their contractual obligation--a \npractice that has occurred for the past 30 years.\n  We both understand that the drug distribution system has consistently \nensured that every pharmacy in the Nation has access to prescription \ndrugs in a timely manner. This system is highly complex but provides an \nextremely efficient delivery model that reduces health care costs to \nthe overall health care system.\n  Within the system, pharmaceutical distributors are able to reduce the \ncost by minimizing the overall number of transactions required to \ndistribute prescription drugs, over-the-counter products, and medical \nsupplies. Nationally, wholesalers serve more than 130,000 customers. \nThe typical distributor purchases products from an average of 850 \nvendors. These distributors take ownership of the products and \nresponsibility for warehousing and distributing individual orders to \nretail pharmacies and other sites of care on a daily basis. This \nefficient model ensures that pharmacies have pharmaceutical products \navailable for their patients.\n  I look forward to working with Chairman Grassley to maintain this \ncurrent drug distribution system and to ensure that when the \nlegislation before us is enacted into law, it clearly excludes prompt-\npay discounts from the pharmacy reimbursement methodology that will be \nused to pay pharmacies for drugs dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries.\n\n\n                     medicare bad debt, collection\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I will discuss today with my distinguished colleague \nfrom Idaho, Senator Crapo, to discuss the change in Medicare bad debt \npolicy as proposed in this budget reconciliation bill. I feel there is \na need to differentiate between debt owed by individuals and debt owed \nby States. The sponsors of this policy argue that it will encourage \nskilled nursing facilities to be more efficient in the collection of \nbad debt. However, how can the facility be more efficient if the state \nsimply refuses to pay the Medicare copayments through its Medicaid \nprogram? In 2003, nursing homes in my home state of Arkansas never \nreceived the $589,263 in coinsurance owed to them from the Medicaid \nprogram. This body should examine the root of this problem before \nimplementing the bad debt policy in this bill. It is my hope that the \nconference committee considers this when examining this policy.\n  Mr CRAPO. Senator Lincoln makes a good point. While I support the \nFinance Committee's goal of encouraging accountability and \nincentivizing the collection of Medicare bad debt by skilled nursing \nfacilities, I do see the need to differentiate between debt owed by \nindividuals and debt owed by States. I believe this conference should \nconsider this point as well.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nsay how deeply concerned I am over the wrong priorities in the spending \nreconciliation bill that is before us today.\n  The United States faces a Federal deficit of $331 billion for fiscal \nyear 2005 alone, according to the Congressional Budget Office. This is \na complete turnaround from when President Bush took office just under \nfive years ago. He inherited record budget surpluses and turned them \ninto record deficits. Unfortunately, that has not stopped Republicans \nfrom pushing relentlessly for the wrong priorities and irresponsible \npolicies.\n  As a result, we now have encountered years of record deficits that \nhave contributed to $3 trillion added to our country's debt. Moreover, \nunder President Bush's watch, American debt to foreigners has doubled. \nJapan holds $680 billion of our debt, China holds $240 billion, and the \nCarribean Banking Centers hold over $100 billion. Increasingly, our \nfate is in the hands of their central banks and investors.\n  We must take action so that we don't put this burden on our Nation's \nfuture generations. The budget reconciliation process was designed for \nsuch a situation: to give Congress the tools necessary for deficit \nreduction. Reconciliation could have offered us the opportunity to work \nacross the aisle to take responsible steps toward reducing the deficit.\n  Instead, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are pushing for \nthe wrong priorities. Take for example their opposition to Senator \nConrad's commonsense amendment on fiscal responsibility. His amendment, \ncalled paygo, would have reinstated a rule meant to stop Congress from \nworsening the deficit. It was my hope that it would have once again \nserved as a check against irresponsible spending or new rounds of tax \ncuts at a time when the Nation cannot afford them.\n  My colleagues across the aisle say that tough choices are needed to \nget our fiscal house in order. I agree--we should balance the federal \nbudget just as every American must balance theirs, unless a natural \ndisaster or other national crisis demands it. Anytime Congress wants to \nraise spending--or lower revenue--Congress should pause and be required \nto stand up to vote and defend its action. That is what this amendment \nwould have required, but Republicans voted against fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  Today, we are debating the spending reconciliation bill for fiscal \nyear 2006, but it is only half of the equation. This bill makes $39 \nbillion in cuts to critical spending programs. Many of these cuts will \ndirectly hurt low- and middle-income Americans. The bill takes away \nAmericans' access to health care and affordable housing and jeopardizes \ntheir pensions. The bill attacks important conservation efforts by \ncutting funding and opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to \ndrilling. But the bill stays silent on lowering energy prices for \nworking families who can no longer afford to pay their monthly gas \nbills. Simply put, it leaves too many Americans out in the cold.\n  In several weeks, the Senate will be taking up a tax reconciliation \nbill. That bill will cut taxes by $70 billion, with an average giveaway \nof $35,500 for those making more than $1 million each year. Those with \nincomes between $50,000 and $200,000 would get just over $100 on \naverage. The difference is striking, but not so much as the fact that \nthis will all be done under the Senate's\n\n[[Page S12328]]\n\nprocedure of reconciliation--which was designed to lower the deficit, \nnot raise it. These tax cuts will undermine the cuts that the bill is \nmaking today to critical spending programs and will add an additional \n$31 billion to the deficit. This is irresponsible. It's just another \nexample of how the President and his allies in Congress have the wrong \npriorities, and not the best interest of America, at heart.\n  What is most frustrating is the knowledge that the final budget will \nlikely be even worse than what we pass in the Senate. The House of \nRepresentatives plans to cut $50 billion in critical services, \nincluding student loans, food stamps, child support enforcement, foster \ncare, and health care. Again, these cuts will not go to lowering the \ndeficit. Instead, they will finance another round of tax cuts at a time \nwhen we also have staggering energy costs, a war in Iraq, many unfunded \neducation needs, an exploding population of seniors, and an \nunprecedented relief and rebuilding effort stemming from Katrina.\n  I believe we must work together to realign priorities so they reflect \nthose of the American people. Working together, we can do better. I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to vote against this misguided bill.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I strongly oppose the so-called Deficit \nReduction Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 2005. This reconciliation bill \nand the administration's budget are fiscally irresponsible and reflect \nmisguided priorities. As a matter of fact, the reconciliation bill at \nthe end of the day will further increase the deficit by more than $35 \nbillion over the next 5 years.\n  In 2 weeks, both the Senate Finance and the House Ways and Means \nCommittees are expected to report a second reconciliation bill that \nwill cut taxes by $70 billion. This $70 billion reduction in tax \nrevenue will more than eliminate the effect of the cuts to critical \nprograms in the reconciliation bill that we are considering this week. \nWith the enactment of two reconciliation bills, there is a real effort \nby this administration and the majority to perform a bait and switch on \nthe American people.\n  Significant portions of the reduction that are achieved in this \nreconciliation bill are achieved by cuts in programs on which low- and \nmoderate-income Americans rely. The Senate reconciliation package \nincludes a total of $39.1 billion in spending cuts over 5 years, of \nwhich $10 billion will come from Medicaid and Medicare. The House \nreconciliation package could have cuts as high as $50 billion over the \nsame period, with $9.5 billion coming out of Medicaid.\n  In contrast, the benefits of the second reconciliation bill that this \nbody will soon undertake will go overwhelmingly to high-income \nindividuals. The tax reconciliation bill is expected to extend many \nprovisions from the 2003 tax cut that expire in 2008 to 2010 that lower \nthe rate on dividend income and capital gains. Just extending these \nprovisions through 2010 is likely to cost nearly $23 billion.\n  The bill before us today includes a series of spending reductions \nthat target pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement, curtail the \ndefinition of `targeted case management' under Medicaid, and eliminate \nthe `HMO slush fund' under the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 and \nthe Federal Housing Administration's affordable housing preservation \nprograms. A provision to update reimbursements for doctors will have a \ndirect impact on seniors in the form of higher Medicare part B \npremiums.\n  Republicans have tried to disguise these cuts by restoring funding \nfor the State Health Insurance Program SCHIP for States such as Rhode \nIsland, allowing parents of severely disabled children to `buy-into' \nMedicaid, and by increasing student financial aid.\n  Meanwhile, the House reconciliation bill is truly an even worse deal \nfor low-income and vulnerable Americans, as it would impose new \ncopayments on Medicaid beneficiaries and allow States to scale back \ncoverage. It also would tighten rules designed to limit the ability of \nelderly people to shed assets in order to qualify for nursing home \ncare. And, for the first time, people with home equity of $500,000 \nwould be ineligible for nursing home care under Medicaid.\n\n  The House bill also includes $844 million in cuts to food stamps, \noverturns a critical court ruling, Rosales v. Thompson, which allows \nfor Federal support of abused and neglected children in foster care who \nreside with family members, weakens States' ability to establish and \nenforce child support orders, and raises interest rates and fees that \nstudents pay on their college loans.\n  The House package takes almost $20 billion out of child support and \nstudent loans alone, compounding the effect on struggling working \nfamilies.\n  I commend Chairman Grassley and the rest of the Finance Committee for \ntheir diligence in attempting to craft a reconciliation measure that \nwould not directly impact Medicaid beneficiaries. By contrast, the \nHouse, targeted beneficiaries through increased Medicaid cost sharing \namong other program changes.\n  In an effort to further minimize the impact of the reconciliation \nbill on these populations, I offered two amendments. The first \namendment would restore Targeted Case Management services, TCM, to \nassist eligible high-need Medicaid beneficiary groups, such as children \nin foster care, children and adults with HIV/AIDS, children with \ndevelopmental disabilities and mental retardation, individuals with \nsubstance abuse disorders and mental illness, and at-risk tribal \npopulations, access to needed medical, social, educational, and other \nservices. States have flexibility whether to offer TCM services and \nwhich population to cover, and, nearly every state now offers TCM \nservices. We should not jeopardize an essential bridge to services for \nthese populations.\n  By focusing cuts on Medicaid and other essential Federal programs, \nthe reconciliation package will most harshly impact those who cannot \nadvocate for themselves--abused and neglected children in foster care, \nat-risk youth, single parents, the disabled, persons with mental \nillness, and vulnerable elderly.\n  I understand that the intent of the TCM provision was to codify a HHS \npolicy from January 2001. Again, I applaud the Chairman for attempting \nto clarify this provision, however, I am deeply concerned that the \nprovision, when implemented, will severely restrict the providers' \nability to serve our most vulnerable Medicaid beneficiaries.\n  The second amendment would strike the Banking Committee's portion of \nthe reconciliation bill that eliminates the ability of HUD to use the \nFHA General Insurance Fund to provide grants to help preserve FHA-\nforeclosed multifamily properties as affordable housing. Given the \ncurrent affordable housing crises in our country, the grants are more \nimportant than ever and should be maintained. I am disappointed that \nthese and other amendments that would have addressed many of the \ndeficiencies of the bill failed.\n  One such amendment was Senator Cantwell's amendment to protect the \nArtic National Wildlife Refuge from drilling. Earlier this year, the \nSenate Budget Committee included in the fiscal year 2006 budget \nresolution provisions that paved the way to arctic drilling. Senator \nCantwell offered an amendment to strike language authorizing artic \ndrilling from the reconciliation bill, which would undo this \nexploitation of the budget process and permit an open debate of the \nissue. Unfortunately, her amendment failed. The bill not only opens up \nthe Artic to oil and gas development, but does so in a way that does \nnot accord this pristine wilderness protection under existing mineral \nleasing laws and regulations, existing environmental protections, and \nexisting rules of administrative procedure and judicial review. In \nshort, it affords the Arctic Refuge less protection than current law \naffords other refuge or public land that is open to oil and gas \ndevelopment. Drilling in the Artic will not help us address our \nnation's energy problems. It is yet another giveaway to big oil \ncompanies.\n  The reconciliation bill also includes a provision that would extend \nagricultural commodity payments until 2011. Extending existing subsidy \nprograms will continue policies that are bad for the environment. While \nthe bill extends the life of subsidy programs and three conservation \nprograms until 2011, it does not extend the life of four other \nconservation programs past 2007. These programs, which restore \nwetlands,\n\n[[Page S12329]]\n\ngrasslands, and other wildlife habitat and protect farmland and \nranchland are critical to meeting some of the Nation's most significant \nenvironmental challenges.\n  In the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, escalating home energy \nprices, and stagnant wage growth, taking money from important federal \nprograms in order to pave the way for billions of dollars in tax cuts \nshows how out of touch the majority and administration are with \nhardworking Americans.\n  The bill before us is lamentable, and I only hope that those who \nsupport it today will reassess their positions in the weeks ahead as we \nconsider other reconciliation bills that will further add to our \ndeficit and continue a path towards misguided priorities.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, my Amendment No. 2415 would inject a dose \nof accountability and responsibility into America's efforts to rebuild \nthe gulf coast and Iraq.\n  It will bar from all reconstruction efforts, both at home and in \nIraq, all firms found--over the last 5 years--to have overcharged or \nimproperly billed the government by more than $10 million on one or \nmore occasions.\n  It will also bar from all reconstruction efforts--both at home and in \nIraq--all firms that have overcharged or defrauded the Government of \nmore than $10 million over the last 5 years.\n  It will also bar from all reconstruction efforts--both at home and in \nIraq--all firms that have been suspended or debarred from competing for \nfederal contracts.\n  It includes a national security waiver for those instances where \ndealing with such firms may serve the national interest.\n  These are serious penalties, but in both Iraq and on the gulf coast \nwe face serious challenges, and we should not do anything less than our \nvery best to face those challenges.\n  We cannot move forward on the gulf coast without looking at the \nadministration's weak oversight of funds in Iraq. The amendment I offer \ntoday seeks to do that by assuring the American people that the \nGovernment will spend gulf coast reconstruction funds wisely.\n  The bill we are debating is ultimately about saving taxpayer dollars. \nWhy not start by weeding out companies that have overcharged the \ntaxpayer in the past?\n  We enjoy the privilege of living in a vastly diverse country of \nvastly talented citizens. In the country with the world's biggest \neconomy, we don't need to rely on just a few privileged firms to do \nAmerica's work.\n  We don't need over-billers, underperformers, or those who have \ndefrauded the American taxpayer to do America's work. We need to \nentrust America's work, and American taxpayer dollars, to firms that \nembrace hard work, accountability, and a sense of responsibility about \nthe public trust into which they enter when they serve as a Government \ncontractor.\n  America has countless firms that fit that bill. They come from across \nthe gulf coast region and from across the country. This amendment \nsimply helps assure that they will have a clear opportunity to shoulder \nthe burden of rebuilding, by clearing away those firms that have abused \nthe public trust.\n  Last Friday, the President announced that he would ask this Congress \nto reallocate $17.1 billion in hurricane emergency funding, taking it \naway from the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Disaster Relief \nFund, and dedicating it to rebuilding and repairing of the gulf coast. \nThe President wants the authority to replace critical infrastructure, \nfacilities, and equipment damaged during this year's hurricanes. These \nare important projects addressing important needs, and I fully support \nthem. We must move forward, but we have to do it right.\n  These are big projects, including the rebuilding of key stretches of \nInterstate 10, a main artery connecting Texas cities such as San \nAntonio to New Orleans and New Orleans to points east. The proposed \nprojects include two Veterans Administration hospitals, major military \nbases, and other highways and bridges damaged by the storms.\n  This work will help shape the gulf coast region for a generation or \nmore. We cannot afford to get it wrong.\n  Sadly, this administration has gotten it wrong before. On Sunday, the \nSpecial Inspector General for Iraqi Reconstruction, Stuart Bowen, \nreleased his latest report on reconstruction in Iraq. Bowen's report \nmakes for sobering reading.\n  It tells a cautionary tale as we look forward to rebuilding our gulf \ncoast communities. It paints a grim picture of conditions in Iraq and \nit tells a story of administration hubris, lack of foresight, poor \nplanning, poor execution, and the squandering of millions and perhaps \nbillions of U.S. taxpayer dollars.\n  The Special Inspector General has warned us all that America's \nambitious reconstruction effort in Iraq, an effort managed by this \nadministration, is, ``likely to fall far short of its goals.''\n  We cannot let the same fate befall our communities here at home. We \nneed to ensure--here at home--the accountability that the \nadministration's efforts in Iraq have sorely lacked. In both \nsituations, the situation demands that we act with speed. In neither \ncase, though, should we ignore our oversight responsibilities.\n  Special Inspector General Bowen's work assessing the administration's \nIraq reconstruction efforts reveals the challenges we now face at home.\n  Since November 2003, Congress has appropriated $21 billion for Iraq \nreconstruction and relief. The President came to us that fall, seeking \nsupport for his ambitious plans to build Iraq anew, and in a bipartisan \nfashion, we gave him everything he asked for.\n  Billions of dollars later, Iraq is still struggling to rebuild.\n  As Michael O'Hanlon and Nina Kamp of the Brookings Institution \ndescribed Iraq last month in the New York Times:\n\n       On balance, the indicators are troubling. Electricity \n     production remains stuck at prewar levels even as demand \n     soars, and the power is off in Baghdad more often than it is \n     on. Unemployment is stubbornly high. Infant mortality rates \n     are still among the Middle East's highest. And Iraq is the \n     most violent country in the region, not only in terms of war \n     casualties but of criminal murders as well.\n\n  How did we come to this pass?\n  Secretary Rumsfeld and his tight circle of Defense Department \nadvisors--awash in unreality--failed to plan for occupation and \nreconstruction. Their plans for rebuilding postwar Iraq were, according \nto the Inspector General, ``insufficient in both scope and \nimplementation.''\n  The Coalition Provisional Authority managed Iraqi oil revenues placed \nin the Development Fund for Iraq. The Special Inspector General has \nfound that it did so erratically and irresponsibly, often with no \naccountability, and no records.\n  The Special Inspector General found that in the town of Hillah, for \nexample, the CPA left 7 million dollars worth of projects uncompleted. \nWhat's more, the money allocated for these projects is missing.\n  Indeed, the Special Inspector General has found that the CPA burned \nthrough nearly $100 million in Development Fund for Iraq money without \nkeeping adequate records, and in too many instances, the money just \nvanished.\n  That is simply inexcusable, and there may be no way now to trace and \nrecover those funds. But where we can track fraud and overbilling to \nspecific companies, why should we keep giving more money to the \noffenders? If they won't protect the public trust, why should we trust \nthem with new money?\n  Where is the accountability? Do we want any of the firms involved in \nthe most egregious of these abuses handed new sums of money to rebuild \nNew Orleans and the gulf coast?\n  Many of our Republican colleagues are demanding that we provide \noffsets for every penny we dedicate to Katrina reconstruction. In too \nmany instances, they seek to place the burden for rebuilding the gulf \ncoast squarely on the poor. Yet they failed to demand offsets, or even \nsimple accountability, when the administration came to Congress looking \nfor reconstruction funds for Iraq.\n  By adopting this amendment, we would promote honesty, transparency, \nand accountability in hurricane reconstruction and we would bar the \ndoor to contractors that have abused the public trust. We need to learn \nfrom the gross failings we have seen in Iraq, learn and do better.\n\n[[Page S12330]]\n\n  Now we face a crisis at home. The President has waited 2 months to \ncreate his Gulf Coast Recovery and Rebuilding Council, which he \nannounced yesterday, and 2 months to name Donald Powell to serve as \nCoordinator of Federal Support for the Gulf Coast's Recovery and \nRebuilding. Let us hope history is not repeating itself.\n  Does the administration have a plan to hold accountable those who \nhave misused Iraq reconstruction funds, and to ensure that the same \ncompanies, or similar firms, are not handed more taxpayer dollars in \nmassive contracting projects?\n  All the major multinational firms working in Iraq have ``cost plus'' \ncontracts. Under such contracts, the Government reimburses companies \nfor all their costs, plus a percentage of those costs as a fee.\n  I don't think that is the best way to protect the taxpayer, but that \nis what this administration has done. If we are going to give \ncorporations cost-plus contracts, is it too much to ask that they take \ncare to charge us only for legitimate costs and not to take advantage \nof our trust, the public trust, to sneak in millions of dollars in \nillegitimate expenses? Why should we give this important work to \ncompanies that will pad their expense sheets and hope that we don't \ncatch their overbillings?\n  Writing big, no-bid deals was quick and easy, but it wasn't good for \nAmerica, and it wasn't good for our reconstruction efforts in Iraq. The \nadministration has shown itself unable or unwilling to manage these \ncontracts.\n  America can do better than this. At home on the gulf coast, it \nabsolutely must do so. It is time to cut off companies that gorge \nthemselves at the public trough.\n  General John Abizaid, the Commander of U.S. Central Command, said \nrecently that the key to military success in Iraq, ``is whether we can \nlearn from our mistakes.''\n  The same holds true for our reconstruction efforts, both at home and \nabroad. Yet poor financial controls and questionable performance by \ncontractors continues to squander an important part of the treasure we \nsink into this effort. We already have seen how FEMA and the \nAdministration dropped the ball in planning for disaster, and in \nresponding to the crisis.\n  We must not fail. The reconstruction challenge now before us is here \nat home.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, the average American might not follow the \nintricacies of our budget reconciliation process. However, they do know \nwhen the government has misplaced its priorities, shirked its \nresponsibilities and shortchanged the families who need help the most.\n  Given our record budget deficits, I am prepared to make tough \ndecisions to cut government spending, but what this bill represents is \na misguided effort to balance the budget on the backs of hard-working \nfamilies.\n  I question the rationale of some of my colleagues in this body who \npropose providing tax breaks for multimillionaires and special \ninterests, while cutting resources that are critical to the families of \nArkansas. For example, I am particularly disappointed that this package \nslashes: health care by $27 million for seniors and the poor; \nagriculture supports for farmers by $3 billion.\n  Mr. President, I want to tell you about Maya Romney of Arkansas. A \nDown's syndrome patient, Maya is able to receive critical therapies \nthrough Easter Seals, allowing her to interact in a classroom setting \nand live more independently. Quite simply, Maya's therapy services \ncould be in jeopardy because Easter Seals is funded primarily through \nMedicaid. And while this saddens me greatly, it should also sadden \neveryone in this body because we all have Mayas in our State or others \nwho depend on Medicaid.\n  This program, that some of my colleagues look to cut, provides vital \nresources for persons with disabilities and seniors. In my State, \nalmost 50 percent of our Medicaid recipients are children. \nAdditionally, 958 beneficiaries in Arkansas right now are Hurricane \nKatrina evacuees.\n  I know that in the long-term we can find ways to save money and \nimprove the efficiency of Medicaid--in fact the Senate has supported \nmeasures to do just that. But, it is unacceptable to impose arbitrary \ncuts for a program that does so much to support families. By taking \naway these services we are endangering the health of too many \nAmericans.\n  As an Arkansan, I am particularly disappointed in proposed cuts to \nagriculture. I know that the chairman of the Agriculture Committee has \nworked hard to make sure these cuts are distributed fairly, and he has \ndone the best he can. I commend him for that.\n  But now is not the time to be cutting our support of agriculture in \nthis country. Our farmers have gone through too much in the past year--\nrising energy costs, drought, and storm damage. They need us now more \nthan ever.\n  But instead of reaching out to help the community that feeds America, \nsome of my colleagues have proposed slashing $3 billion from \nagricultural programs, and imposing further payment limits that will \ndramatically hurt family farms.\n  Rural America is fed up. It seems as though every time this \nadministration has needed to find revenue, whether to pay for the war \nin Iraq, cut the deficit, or provide relief from Hurricane Katrina, \nagriculture has been first on the chopping block.\n  Our farmers know they must do their fair share, but they are \ncurrently doing much more than that.\n  For the government's part, we should be investing in rural America \nnot taking from it. There is enormous potential in rural communities \nand we should harness that potential to help drive our economy.\n  Now as I said earlier, the budget process requires us to take \nresponsibility in balancing our books. But in the dense pages of the \nreconciliation package, we have lost sight of fiscal responsibility and \nare blithely ignoring several issues that will affect our budget for \nyears to come.\n  After the Senate considers these budget cuts we will then vote on a \nset of tax breaks totaling $70 billion. It is no secret that the only \nreason we are looking at these budget cuts is to make room for tax \ncuts--most of which could be argued will not make it in to the pockets \nof people that need it the most.\n  And oddly enough, some of the tax cuts that we will be voting on, \nsuch as the capital gains and dividends cuts do not even expire for \nanother 2 years.\n  But even more baffling is the fact that neither this budget bill or \nthe tax cut bill we will consider in the coming weeks takes into \naccount the billions of dollars we have spent and will continue to \nspend in Iraq. Neither bill takes into account the billions of dollars \nwe have spent and will spend in the gulf coast.\n  I have voted for tax cuts in the past, and I will vote for them in \nthe future but if we were truly being honest brokers this body would \nhave the courage to look at all of our fiscal issues in a single \npackage. Instead, we seem content to legislate in a vacuum where we \nrefuse to recognize the reality of our fiscal situation.\n  We separate tax cuts bill from the budget bill, and the budget bill \nfrom emergency spending bill because deep down we know that we are \nwrong. We know that if we were to look at this fiscal puzzle as a \nwhole, there would be no way to justify our actions. We would have to \nfinally admit that we are being fiscally irresponsible.\n  Overall, this measure shows America that their government is willing \nto turn their backs on the families who need our help the most in order \nto provide favors for special interest groups. I cast my vote in \nopposition to this bill: it does not reflect my priorities, and it \ncertainly does not reflect America's priorities.\n  Mr. President, I would like to express my serious concerns about \nefforts today, and possibly during the conference committee, that could \ndramatically cut Medicaid funding through this bill. Medicaid provides \nvital services for millions of Americans, especially persons with \ndisabilities, children, and seniors. As we all know, access to health \ncare is critically important for improving the quality of life and \npromoting greater independence for these individuals.\n  In my State alone, 17 percent of Arkansans depend on the Medicaid \nProgram. An additional 1,000 Hurricane Katrina evacuees currently \nresiding in Arkansas are receiving their health care through the \nState's Medicaid Program. It is essential that State Medicaid Programs \nand patients get the\n\n[[Page S12331]]\n\nsupport they need, particularly at a time when States are facing \nbudgetary crises and struggling to deal with skyrocketing costs \nassociated with providing health care.\n  I understand that tough financial decisions have to be made in order \nkeep this country's fiscal house in order, but I do not believe it is \nfair that we require our seniors, our children, and the disabled to \nshoulder this burden. It is simply unacceptable to impose arbitrary \ncuts for a program that does so much to support families in need. I \nbelieve we can find appropriate savings in Medicaid without \njeopardizing the health care of so many Americans, and this body has \nsupported measures to do that in the past. For example, I supported a \nbill to charge the Institutes of Medicine with evaluating Medicaid to \nfind appropriate cost savings and improve efficiency within the \nprogram. But the proposals many Members of the House of Representatives \nare promoting in their version of this legislation completely fail to \nconsider the implications for the health and well-being of Medicaid \nrecipients. Rather, these cuts would have more to do with paying for \ntax cuts targeted to benefit the wealthiest Americans.\n  I believe Senator Grassley and some members of the Finance Committee \ntried hard to soften the blow of the cuts required by the budget \nresolution, but I recognize that a much worse bill will likely emerge \nfrom the conference committee with the House of Representatives, and we \nwill likely regret starting down this slope toward drastic cuts to an \nessential part of our Nation's health care system.\n  I have heard from many organizations and constituents who have \nexpressed their concerns. Dana Plunkett and Angela Romney have both \nsent letter expressing their concerns for their children. Both of these \nmothers' children participate in the Easter Seals program which relies \nheavily on Medicaid. Dana's son Larry is able to live in an independent \nliving facility because of Medicaid. Angela's daughter Maya who has \nDown's syndrome has been able to receive vital therapies to allow her \nto interact in a classroom setting and live more independently.\n  I am aware of the challenges many families, health care providers, \nStates, and private payers for health care face under our burdened \nhealth care system. I appeal to my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to find a solution to adequately fund Medicaid and avoid gutting \nthe program during conference negotiations.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, this week, the Senate is undertaking a \nsignificant effort to reduce Federal spending and return fiscal \nresponsibility to the Congress. Not since 1997 has Congress attempted a \nbudget reconciliation bill. But the fiscal situation facing the \nAmerican people today demands a serious commitment from the Federal \nGovernment to reduce deficit spending. This reconciliation package is \nan important part of that process.\n  I recommend the chairman of the Budget Committee for his efforts on \nreconciliation. He has been an outstanding advocate for fiscal \nrestraint, while trying to respond fairly to the competing demands for \nincreased spending. While I do have some concerns about certain cuts \nincluded in this bill, on the whole I think it is a balanced package \nthat accomplishes meaningful restraints on Government spending.\n  One of the positives of this bill is the provisions relating to \nenergy production in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. It is time to \nopen ANWR for oil production to increase our domestic supply of \npetroleum. We need to look no further than the gas pump to see what \nhappens when U.S. oil production lulls. High gas prices hurt Montanans \nand dependence on foreign oil hurts our national security.\n  The Energy Information Administration states that the coastal plain \nregion harboring the 1.5 million-acre 1002 Area is ``the largest \nunexplored, potential productive onshore basin in the United States.'' \nStudies by the U.S. Geological Survey, USGS, estimate that drilling in \nANWR could yield up to 16 billion barrels of oil--an amount roughly \nequal to 30 years of oil imports from Saudi Arabia.\n  Most people don't understand that the 1002 Area is only 1.5 million \nacres within the 19 million acre Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. This \nbudget allows for development of only 2000 of those 19 million acres in \nANWR. That means 99.99 percent of ANWR will be untouched. If this \ntragedy-filled hurricane season has taught us anything, we should \nrealize that by concentrating our production and refinery capability in \nthe Gulf of Mexico, we are risking supply disruption.\n  We need to do more offshore, and more onshore across this country. \nLast week, I held a hearing on onshore oil and gas development. The \nbacklog we face in processing permits for reasonable onshore production \ncontributes to the energy crisis we are facing now. All segments of the \neconomy are directly impacted by the costs of fuel to produce and move \nour output. From keeping warm in our homes to moving food to the \nmarket, the American taxpayer faces a tighter budget as a result of \nskyrocketing energy costs. We simply must consider all options when it \ncomes to increasing production, and ANWR are an important part of that.\n  The United States has some of the strictest environmental laws in the \nentire world. We can safely and carefully produce oil within our own \nshores, or we can ignore our responsibility to domestically produce \nthis resource. Royalty revenues from oil production in ANWR is expected \nto produce $2.5 billion for the Federal Government over the next 5 \nyears alone, plus provide valuable jobs, and reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil.\n  It is time for this body to do the right thing and increase our \ndomestic production of energy, and ANWR is a good place to start. So I \napplaud the work of the chairman of the Energy Committee for including \nANWR in this budget.\n  I am also pleased with the provisions to address digital television \ntransition. Setting a firm date of April 7, 2009, allows the FCC to \nmake critical spectrum available for the emergency workers who protect \nour communities. Our first responders need access to this spectrum to \nensure communications in times of national emergencies.\n\n  In a rural State like Montana, this spectrum can also be used to \nexpand broadband access, linking rural communities not just for \nemergency needs, but for education, telehealth, and economic \ndevelopment.\n  The revenues generated by this spectrum auction generate billions \ntoward paying down the national debt, but also give us the flexibility \nto address some other priorities, including essential air service. I \nwas pleased to be able to include language in this bill that will \nprovide an additional $75 million for essential air.\n  Thirty-seven States rely on essential air, but skyrocketing fuel \nprices are placing that service in jeopardy. The provision I included \nwill increase EAS funding over the next 5 years, and ensure that \ncommunities relying on essential air will continue to have \ntransportation options.\n  Also important to Montana is ensuring that Federal incentives for \nhigher education remain intact. Though significant cost savings have \nbeen achieved in the reconciliation package adopted by the Senate's \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, many positive changes \nhave been made to benefit the students who most need assistance.\n  The higher education reforms save $9.8 billion over 5 years, while \nstill preserving critical benefits for students across the country. For \nfirst- and second-year college students, the loan limits will be \nincreased to $3,500 for the first year and $4,500 for the second year. \nThis is especially important in a State like Montana, which ranks \nthird-from-last in retention of first-year college students who \ncontinue on to their second year.\n  Not only are we increasing the overall aid available, but are also \nemphasizing the various types of education needed from the current \nworkforce. This bill provides for additional funding for grants for \nPell-eligible students who major in math, science, technology, \nengineering, and some foreign languages. All too often, employers \ncomment that they have skilled jobs available, but are unable to find \nthe kind of specialization they need from students, and by providing \nincentives for students to study in these under-utilized areas, they \nare able to obtain an affordable education and fill a much-needed place \nin the workforce.\n  I am especially proud of the provision in this bill which provides \nfor\n\n[[Page S12332]]\n\ndeferment on loan payment for borrowers serving in active duty or in \nthe National Guard. This provision sends a strong message of support to \nour men and women in uniform, and I am pleased to support its \ninclusion.\n  While there is plenty to praise in this reconciliation package, I \nhave very strong concerns about the proposals to cut $4 billion out of \nagriculture programs. When this Senate debated the spending cuts and \nreconciliation instructions earlier this year, this body agreed to $3 \nbillion in agriculture cuts.\n  While I would prefer no cuts to farm bill programs, I understand that \neveryone must do his or her part to reduce Government spending. The \nHouse of Representatives wanted to cut more out of farm programs, as \ndid the President. I think the Senate settled on a fair amount, and I \napplaud the chairman of the Budget Committee for retaining that level \nin conference.\n  But we are not talking about $3 billion in cuts, the $3 billion that \nwe all agreed to. Instead, farm programs are taking a massively \ndisproportionate cut. Commodity and conservation programs are being \nreduced by nearly $4 billion. The extra money is not being returned to \nthe Government to pay down the debt. It is going to a select group of \ninterests, to subsidize small dairies. These budget cuts pit one \nproducer against another. My Montana wheat growers are being asked to \npay for dairy subsidies. That is simply unreasonable.\n  In these times of high energy and fertilizer costs, we are asking \nfarmers to bear much more than their fair share of program cuts. I urge \nmy colleagues to reconsider this proposal. Cuts to agriculture spending \nneed to be fair and shared across the board. Giving one sector of one \nindustry a billion dollars for 2 years, at the expense of farmers all \nover the country sends a terrible message to the hardworking families \nthat feed this Nation.\n  Lastly, I want to turn to the issue of cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. \nWhile I believe the proposals to reform and strengthen Medicare and \nMedicaid included in this reconciliation package are generally good, \nthere are some issues I want to highlight.\n  I remain concerned about our community and independent pharmacists. \nIn Montana, they are small business men and women, and, all too often, \nthey are the only place in small towns where folks can get the \nmedication they need. I remain concerned about how this package may \naffect them and will do what I can to make sure they are not adversely \naffected by provisions in this bill.\n  However, this bill also provides funding to states that face \nshortfalls in the State Children's Health Insurance Program. SCHIP, and \nexpands outreach and enrollment activities to cover more children. The \nSCHIP program has been incredibly important in Montana, in ensuring \nchildren have the health care they need to lead healthy, fruitful \nlives. I am glad to see that this bill also establishes a new grant \nprogram to finance innovative outreach and enrollment efforts designed \nto increase enrollment and promote an understanding of the value of \nhealth insurance coverage. I expect this outreach to be helpful in \nMontana, where reaching those in need is often difficult because of the \nvastness of our state.\n  This bill will also extend the Medicare Dependent Hospital program, \nwhich provides financial protections to rural hospitals with less than \n100 beds that have a greater than 60 percent share of Medicare \npatients. Many of Montana's hospitals fall into this category, as our \nMedicare population, especially in the most rural areas continues to \ngrow rapidly.\n  Medicaid options are expanded through the Family Opportunity Act, so \nthat parents of severely disabled children can go to work, without \nrisking Medicaid benefits. New incentives are provided to purchase \nlong-term care, and new resources are provided to help states combat \nfraud and abuse that steal money away from low-income families that \nneed it the most. These are good reforms, and they will greatly benefit \nMontanans.\n  Undertaking spending cuts on any scale is a difficult task. But \nCongress must do its duty to rein in the growth of the Federal \nGovernment, provide incentives to economic growth, and ensure that the \nsafety nets we have in place are truly benefiting those who need \nassistance most. Although there are certainly things I would change \nabout this package, I urge my colleagues to support it. The American \npublic must know that Congress is willing to make difficult choices to \nreduce runaway Government spending and use tax dollars wisely. This \nbudget is a good start, and I look forward to supporting its passage.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I oppose the legislation the Senate \nis considering today. This bill does not reflect American values. \nAlthough proponents of the bill try to claim that this is a deficit \nreduction bill, it is transparently not so. This bill is only the first \nhalf of their budget policy. The second half, which we will see in a \ncouple of weeks, provides tax cuts almost double the size of these \nspending cuts. In the end, the policy advanced by this reconciliation \nprocess is to increase the deficit by more than $30 billion in order to \nprovide additional tax cuts while shortchanging valuable programs.\n  I am extremely concerned about how this legislation will affect the \npeople in my State of West Virginia. I believe that the effect will be \nvery painful indeed. This bill cuts $10 billion from Medicaid, on which \nour most vulnerable members of society depend for basic health care. I \nhave fought very hard to improve the provisions of this bill related to \nMedicare and Medicaid, but I am sorry to say that in the end, this bill \nwill deal a terrible blow to those programs. And the effects will \ncertainly be felt by our neediest and sickest citizens.\n  In a letter to the Congress, the National Council of Churches said of \nthis budget bill, ``It violates all the fundamental Christian values of \nloving thy neighbor, caring for the poor, and showing mercy.'' In fact, \nthey said that this proposed budget would be a ``moral disaster of \nmonumental proportion.'' I think it is a very sad day when the Senate \nof the United States would vote for such legislation, especially in the \ncontext of a fiscal policy that is focused on giving additional tax \ncuts.\n  In a broader sense, I am very concerned about what this bill says \nabout the state of Congress' budget process. I am afraid that the \nbudget reconciliation process that was originally intended to help \nCongress enact difficult policies to reduce deficits is being utterly \nabused by the majority to enact policies that not only cannot garner \nbroad support but also do nothing to improve our nation's fiscal \nsituation. The unique role of the Senate is undermined when the \nreconciliation process is used to enact policies that are not related \nto deficit reduction, most egregiously in this bill drilling for oil in \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  Today, Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan testified to the Joint \nEconomic Committee that unless reversed the nation's ``budget trends \nwill cause severe economic disruptions.'' I agree with Mr. Greenspan, \nand I stand ready to work with my colleagues toward the goal of deficit \nreduction. However, the reconciliation process underway in Congress \ntoday, in fact, will exacerbate our runaway deficits.\n  I vehemently oppose this bill. I ask my colleagues to join me in \ndefeating it so that we can make real progress toward improving our \nNation's budget situation in a way that is consistent with our American \nvalues, in a way that is truly compassionate toward the least fortunate \nof our fellow citizens.\n  Mr. President, I also wanted to make a brief statement about the \nfundamental importance of providing help and support to the families \ndevastated by Hurricane Katrina. This is an unprecedented disaster. \nMany families lost every thing they own and they have been displaced \nfor months, and that sadly will continue to be the case for quite some \ntime.\n  For weeks, I joined Senators Grassley, Baucus and others to fight for \nlegislation to expand health care coverage for these needy families. \nToday, I voted for Senator Lincoln's amendment to expand Medicaid \ncoverage to help the evacuees of this disaster. I am disappointed that \nthis amendment failed by a vote of 52 to 47. These families need and \ndeserve health care. It is tragic that the Senate refused to help \nvulnerable Americans.\n  On the education front, the reconciliation package included by voice \nvote an Enzi-Kennedy amendment to provide support to the schools that \nhave\n\n[[Page S12333]]\n\nalready accepted evacuee students. The children and all the schools \nthat accepted such students, without knowing how or when they would get \nfunding deserve our support.\n  I voted against the Ensign-Santorum amendment that sought to change \nthe Enzi-Kennedy bill into a direct voucher program. It would have \nremoved the carefully negotiated provisions designed to maintain the \nbasic civil rights protections in the underlying education package. \nThis legislation, in my view, merely provides a one time emergency \nfinancial grant to the schools and communities that opened their doors \nand classrooms to evacuee students following such an historic disaster.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank the leadership for giving me an \nopportunity to express some concerns with the version of ``value-based \npurchasing'' for physicians in the Medicare program, as presented in \nthe Senate reconciliation legislation. While I commend the committee's \nefforts in finding budget off-sets to stop the Medicare payment cuts \nfacing physicians next year I believe the committee, and Congress as a \nwhole, has accepted the idea of ``value-based purchasing'' with little \ndiscussion, vetting and evidence that it will actually do what people \nsay it will do.\n  We have a big problem in the Medicare system. Our physicians, the \nbread and butter of the Medicare program who provide millions of \nservices each year to Medicare beneficiaries, are facing unprecedented \ncuts in their reimbursement at a time when their own costs are \nskyrocketing. We have known about this problem for years, have taken \naction to prevent previously scheduled cuts and once again we must take \naction this year to prevent more cuts. I commend the Senate Finance \nCommittee's efforts for at least preventing these cuts for a year and \nrecommending that physicians receive a modest one percent increase \ninstead of a 4.4 percent cut. I know the physician community is \ngrateful for this effort in a time of budget deficits, hurricanes and \nother problems.\n  I am concerned about another provision included in the bill--\nspecifically, value-based purchasing, a.k.a. ``pay-for-performance.'' \nMy concern is that this concept is not ready to be codified and be \ntaken to prime-time. In the last decade, we have already declared two \nMedicare physician payment systems--the current sustainable growth rate \nformula and the volume performance standard--dysfunctional and \nunworkable. I do not see the value of diving so quickly into adding a \nnew, untested and unproven system on top of an already declared \ndisaster--the sustainable growth rate or ``SGR.''\n  As a physician, I can attest that most doctors are dedicated to \nimproving the quality of care they provide their patients. The concept \nof continuing medical education and continuous quality improvement is \nengrained in our medical culture. For years, physicians have been \ninvolved in peer review, the development of clinical guidelines and \nbest practices, and outcome measurement. The concept of value-based \npurchasing is to turn these practices into a payment system that pays \nhigher performers more and pays less to those who cannot make the \ngrade. In theory, this has great promise and I believe it will improve \nthe quality of care provided to all Medicare beneficiaries while \nincreasing efficiency in the system.\n  However, I am concerned that the language included in S. 1932, the \n``Deficit Reduction Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 2005'' will not \nachieve these goals. While it does give physicians a 1 percent update \nfor 2006, it does not address the impending cuts scheduled for January \n1, 2007. The proposed legislation does not fix the SGR, it instead \nplaces cuts on top of cuts, and infuses a system that mandates greater \nvolume on top of one that penalizes physicians for volume increases. \nValue-based purchasing and the SGR are not compatible and cannot work \ntogether. In exchange for a one percent increase in 2006, physicians \ncould receive cuts of up to 7.5 percent in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and \n2011. If you think your physician constituents are frustrated now, wait \nuntil they understand this.\n  Under the suggested program, some physicians may have the opportunity \nto earn back that additional two percent cut if they meet specific \n``quality'' and/or ``efficiency'' measures. Many of these measures have \nnot yet been developed, have not yet been vetted by consensus building \ngroups like the National Quality Forum and may or may not be evidenced-\nbased. Before there is value-based purchasing, there must be agreed \nupon, comprehensive quality and efficiency measures for each medical \nspecialty developed by the specialties themselves. In this proposed \nlegislation, bureaucrats in Baltimore would primarily develop the \nmeasures that physicians across the country--with limited input from \nthe physician and specialist community. I can tell you as a doctor that \nI am not interested in having some bureaucrat in Baltimore tell me how \nto deliver a baby in Muskogee, OK, and my patients are not either. \nPhysicians must be the ones to develop these measures if they are going \nto be held accountable and if it is really going to improve quality and \nnot just be another layer of paperwork and bureaucratic administration.\n  I believe pay-for-performance is critical to improving quality in our \nhealthcare system. But we must get it right. Our physicians are facing \nyear after year of cuts and beneficiaries are facing a loss of access \nto the physicians they know and trust. I believe the correct course is \nto deliberately and methodically build up toward a new physician \npayment system that accurately accounts for the cost in providing care \nto beneficiaries while encouraging and rewarding high quality and \nimprovement.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to the \nspending reconciliation bill, which has been misleadingly titled the \n``Deficit Reduction Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 2005.'' As some of my \ncolleagues have mentioned, the spending bill before us today is only \none-third of the budget reconciliation picture--the other two pieces \nare a tax cut bill and a bill to increase the debt limit. Taken \ntogether, this package of reconciliation legislation would increase the \nbudget deficit and impose greater costs on some of the most vulnerable \nmembers of our society. It would also allow for drilling in the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge, which would be environmentally damaging and \ndo nothing to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. The bill fails to \nreflect the priorities of the people of our nation and it fails to \nseriously address the major challenges we face as a Nation.\n  We are living today in an increasingly global society, one that \npresents tremendous opportunities. But with those opportunities come \nchallenges. Today, countries like China and India are becoming \nincreasingly desirable for venture capitalists interested in \ninvestment, for students interested in higher education, and for \ncompanies interested in labor that is not only inexpensive but well-\neducated and well-trained, too. With economic development and expansion \nhave come greater competitive pressures.\n  Our labor market is under strain--real wages are stagnating, health \ncare is becoming increasingly unaffordable, and pension benefits are \nbeing eroded and cut. The science and math scores of our high school \nseniors are at the bottom of the pack of industrialized nations. And we \nare the only nation in the developed world where literacy levels of \nolder adults are higher than those of young adults.\n  Our Nation faces a choice. Are the administration and Congress going \nto respond to new challenges in a sensible and progressive way or will \nthey continue to ignore the facts and adhere to policies that have \nbrought Americans higher deficits, higher unemployment, and lower \nincomes? Will they continue to hold to the primitive philosophy that \nlower taxes on the most affluent, higher taxes on everyone else, and \nless investment in education, research, and business growth will \nsomehow magically restore us to our place of economic preeminence in \nthe world?\n  This view is naive and betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of our \nhistory. Our economic success has not been achieved despite investments \nwe made in our people, but because of them. The not-so-benign neglect \nthat characterizes much of our current national economic policy is not \na strategy for success. It's an excuse for complacency, and ultimately \na recipe for mediocrity.\n  Regrettably, this reconciliation package continues failed policies \nthat will only continue to erode our Nation's place in the world.\n\n[[Page S12334]]\n\n  First and foremost, the budget reconciliation package takes the worst \nfiscal record of any president in history and makes it worse. It takes \nprocedural rules specifically designed to reduce the deficit and uses \nthem to increase the deficit by $30 to 35 billion over the next 5 \nyears. Part one of this reconciliation legislation may be cutting \nspending by $35 billion, but part two will provide tax breaks costing \neven more--$70 billon.\n  This fiscal irresponsibility is not an isolated case. Under President \nBush, the Federal budget has gone from a surplus of $236 billion in \n2000 to a deficit of $319 billion in 2005. The national debt has risen \nby nearly two and a half trillion dollars since 2000, totaling roughly \n$8 trillion as of this morning. That amounts to $27,041.81 for every \nman, woman, and child in the United States. Every minute in 2005, \nRepublican budget policies have added $1,048,952 to the national debt.\n  As we have borrowed more, we have been forced to rely increasingly \nheavily on foreign lenders--particularly the central banks of countries \nlike China and Japan--to fund our profligate ways. Foreign holdings of \nU.S. Treasury debt have more than doubled under the Bush administration \nfrom $1.01 trillion in January 2001 to $2.06 trillion in August 2005. \nJapan now holds $684 billion of that debt and China now holds $248 \nbillion. We are playing a dangerous game here by relying so heavily on \nborrowing from abroad.\n  Some in this administration have reportedly argued that deficits \ndon't matter. I strongly disagree. By blowing a massive hole in our \nbudget, this administration and the Republican majority in Congress \nhave seriously jeopardized our ability to meet the needs of our \nnation's other critical priorities.\n  The cost of the Bush administration's deficits is reflected right \nhere in this spending reconciliation bill. In order to pay for just a \nsmall piece of the Bush tax cuts for the most affluent, this \nlegislation would impose harmful cuts that would fall \ndisproportionately on working Americans and the most vulnerable in our \nsociety.\n  For example, this bill cuts funding for Medicare and Medicaid, which \nprovide health care to poor children, working men and women, the \ndisabled, and the elderly. It cuts funding to rehabilitate FHA-insured \nmulti-family housing. It dramatically increases the premiums paid by \npension plans to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, the Federal \npension insurer, making it more expensive for companies to offer \ndefined benefit pension plans for their employees.\n  While many of the health care cuts in the Senate's reconciliation \nbill are less severe than what is contained in parallel House \nreconciliation proposal, I remain concerned that even under the Senate \nplan Medicare beneficiaries will have to pay more for critically needed \nservices and access to Medicaid services could be limited for some \nbeneficiaries.\n  As bad as the cuts are in the bill before this body, the companion \nlegislation in the House of Representatives is much, much worse. It \ncontains food stamp cuts for roughly 300,000 people, most of them in \nworking families. It contains Medicaid cuts that would reduce health \ncare benefits and increase health care costs for roughly 6 million \nchildren, as well as many low-income parents, the elderly, and people \nwith disabilities. And it contains cuts in child support enforcement, \nchild care assistance, and Federal foster care assistance.\n  So let us not be under any illusions: any conference agreement with \nthe other body is likely to be even more harmful to the well-being of \nAmericans.\n  The reason for these cuts is to pay for a small portion of President \nBush's tax breaks for those who need them least. More than 70 percent \nof the benefits of the Bush 2001 and 2003 tax break packages have gone \nto the 20 percent of taxpayers with the highest incomes, according to \nthe nonpartisan Tax Policy Center of the Urban Institute and the \nBrookings Institution. More than 25 percent of the tax-cut benefits \nhave gone to the top one percent. I believe these priorities are \nseriously out of step with the values of this Nation.\n  In addition to cutting assistance for the poor to pay for tax cuts \nfor the wealthy, this legislation would open the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge to drilling. Not only would such drilling be incredibly \ndamaging to the region's fragile ecosystem, it would do nothing to \nreduce our Nation's dependence on foreign oil. Reasonable estimates \nproject that drilling in the Refuge would provide only enough oil to \nsatisfy U.S. demand for 6 months. Moreover, this supply would not even \ncome on-line for 10 years. The belief that our country can drill our \nway out of dependence on foreign energy sources is misguided.\n  As a nation, we face significant challenges in both the short and \nlong term. Americans are concerned about finding and keeping good jobs, \npaying for soaring energy prices, and whether they will have good \nhealth care when they need it. They are concerned about hurricane \ndisaster relief and rebuilding assistance, and preparedness for the \nthreat of an avian flu crisis. They are concerned about the war in Iraq \nand protecting the homeland from terrorist attacks. They are concerned \nabout our education system and our competitiveness in the global \neconomy.\n  The budget resolution--and the reconciliation legislation that \ncarries out its instructions--is a statement of priorities. \nUnfortunately, the bill before this body today fails to seriously \naddress the concerns of American families and businesses.\n  We can do better than this legislation. We can do better than harmful \ncuts for the poor and for children and for seniors. We can do better \nthan using these cuts to pay for tax breaks for the most well-off in \nour society--who are, by the way, hardly clamoring for the kind of tax \nlargesse that this Administration and its allies in the Congress insist \non heaping upon them.\n  We should be investing in our society--in our education system and \nour knowledge base. We should be investing in science and technology \nand research and development. This legislation is not about investing \nin America. It is about fiscal irresponsibility in the name of tax \nbreaks for those who need them least. Therefore, Mr. President, I \ncannot support this bill.\n  While I am unhappy with this reconciliation package overall, I am \npleased that this bill does contain lifesaving legislation that I have \nintroduced the past two Congresses that will provide Medicare coverage \nfor screening for a dangerous condition known as abdominal aortic \naneurysm--or AAA--a silent killer that claims the lives of 15,000 \nAmericans each year. AAAs occur when there is a weakening of the walls \nof the aorta, the body's largest blood vessel. This artery begins to \nbulge, most often very slowly and without symptoms, and can lead to \nrupture and severe internal bleeding. AAA is a devastating condition \nthat is often fatal without detection, with less than 15 percent of \nthose afflicted with a ruptured aorta surviving. Estimates indicate \nthat 2.7 million Americans suffer from AAA. Further, research indicates \nthat when detected before rupturing, AAAs are treatable and curable in \n95 percent of the cases. And while most AAAs are never diagnosed, \nnearly all can be detected through an inexpensive and painless \nscreening.\n  I want to thank my colleague Senator Jim Bunning for joining me in \nsupporting this important and lifesaving legislation. When we first \nintroduced this legislation in the last Congress, we were joined by \npatients who had suffered a ruptured aorta as result of an AAA and \ntheir families. At this event these patients shared with us their \nharrowing and personal stories of battling this deadly condition. It is \nbecause of struggles like theirs that we are here today at the outset \nof an effort to prevent abdominal aortic aneurysms from advancing to \nthe point of rupture by providing coverage for a simple yet lifesaving \nscreening. Simply put this legislation is about saving lives and I am \npleased that it is contained in the bill passed today.\n  Finally, I would also like to say a brief word about the amendment \nbeing offered by Senator Byrd that deals with the issue of H-1B and L-1 \nvisas. His amendment would strike the text in the underlying bill \ndealing with immigrant worker visas and replace it with a $1,500 fee \nfor employers who file a petition to hire a foreign worker under the L-\n1 visa program.\n  Immigration reform is a critical issue that this body must address. \nIt is a matter of national security, of overall economic well being, \nand of protecting American workers. Simply put,\n\n[[Page S12335]]\n\nthe underlying bill is not the appropriate place to address such \ncritical and complicated immigration issues as the H-1B visa. So I \nthank Senator Byrd for offering his amendment. I strongly support it \nand I hope that my colleagues will as well when it comes to a vote.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today's vote is the first part of a \nthree-step budget reconciliation package that actually leaves this \nNation's budget worse off than it is now, not by tens of millions of \ndollars, which itself would have been a disservice to the American \npublic, but by tens of billions of dollars.\n  Using reconciliation to push through legislation that will worsen our \nbudget deficit and add billions more to the mountain of debt our \nchildren and grandchildren will have to pay is a perversion of a \nprocess designed to expedite measures to reduce the deficit.\n  Reconciliation was intended to help facilitate the enactment of \nmeasures to reduce the deficit. It is ironic, to say the least, that it \nshould be used to enact measures that only aggravate our budget \ndeficits and increase our massive debt.\n  No one who has served in this body for the past 10 years, and \nespecially the past 4\\1/2\\ years, should pretend to be shocked, \nhowever. This is only the latest abuse of a reconciliation process that \nin recent years has been the principal tool used to enact some of the \nmost reckless fiscal policies in recent history.\n  But for even the most cynical, there are new lows in this bill, most \nnotably the use of reconciliation to jam through a controversial policy \nmeasure to permit drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge. At the very least, the Senate should be allowed to conduct a \nfull and open debate on this misguided decision to undermine the crown \njewel of our National Wildlife Refuge System. To say that the inclusion \nof this provision in the reconciliation package is based on dubious \nrevenue assumptions would be kind. By perverting the budget process to \npush through oil and drilling in the Arctic Refuge, the majority has \nsuccessfully squandered away the legacy of environmental stewardship \ninitiated by President Eisenhower in 1960.\n  Also of concern are the significant changes to the Medicare and \nMedicaid programs, cutting programs that offer critical health care \nservices to people who most need it. The Senate package does adopt some \npositive changes, such as cutting the Medicare Advantage slush fund, \npreventing Medicare cuts to physician payments, and protecting \ninpatient rehabilitation hospitals. Unfortunately, the President has \nmade it clear that he does not support many of the provisions that will \nprotect beneficiaries, but instead would rather give money to insurance \nand pharmaceutical companies.\n  The administration has stated that it prefers provisions offered in \nthe House budget package. The House plan for Medicaid cuts includes \ncutting programs for children, pregnant mothers, the disabled, and the \nelderly, while including stipulations to shift costs onto already poor \nand vulnerable populations. This bill will result in considerable \nchanges to these programs that could negatively affect multiple \ngenerations of American families, and I am deeply concerned about the \npossibility of a final conference report that adopts the House approach \non these issues.\n  In one of the few bright spots in this package, the Agriculture \nCommittee overwhelmingly and in a bipartisan manner proposed an \nextension of the Milk Income Loss Contract, MILC, program as part of \nits reconciliation package. This committee action and the lack of an \nattempt to remove the extension on the floor show the strong support \nfor this vital dairy safety net. I renew my call to the administration \nto fulfill the President's campaign promise and actively work with \nmembers of the House to reaffirm the Senate's strong support for MILC.\n  I close by cautioning my colleagues in the majority party that the \nprecedents set by previous reconciliation bills and being set in this \none lay the groundwork for the leveraging through of policies they may \nfind troubling the day Democrats become the majority party in the \nSenate. And that day will come.\n  My friends across the aisle may be thinking, ``We have nothing to \nlose. When Democrats take control, there will be enough of them who \nwill object to the kinds of abuses of the reconciliation process in \nwhich we engaged.''\n  Well, if that is their thinking, they may be right. But I suggest \nthat it is an unreliable strategy. The best protection against possible \nDemocratic abuse of reconciliation in the future is to ensure that the \nrules are enforced as they were intended at all times, not just when \nthey serve your immediate policy objectives.\n  Using reconciliation to enact controversial energy and health \npolicies is an abuse of that process. Using reconciliation to enact \nlegislation that will worsen budget deficits and increase the debt is \nan abuse of that process.\n  And, please, let's not waste the Senate's time with arguments that \nsomehow this particular bill before us isn't an abuse because this \nbill, by itself, does not worsen the deficit. No matter how many pieces \nyou slice it into, the reconciliation package will leave us with bigger \ndeficits, not smaller ones.\n  When Congress and the White House become serious about cleaning up \nthe fiscal mess they created, and when they are willing to spread the \nburden of that clean up across all programs--defense and nondefense \ndiscretionary programs, entitlements, and the spending done through the \nTax Code--I am ready to help. But so long as we see reconciliation \nmeasures that are contemptuous of the principles on which \nreconciliation was based, I must oppose them.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I strongly oppose the reconciliation bill \nbefore the Senate.\n  The bill would cut vital programs for the middle class, elderly, and \npoor in order to pave the way for yet another tax cut for the richest \nindividuals in the county.\n  Hurricane Katrina focused the Nation's attention on America's poor \nand displaced. In the wake of the storm, the people demanded that \nCongress act to help Americans in need and were justifiably angry at \nthe administration's slow and inadequate response. Americans recognize \nthat their government should aid those in distress in order to make \nthis a better country for everyone.\n  That is why I cannot believe only 2 months after Katrina, we have a \nbill that would cut Medicare and Medicaid by $27 billion, increase \nMedicare premiums for seniors, cut the availability of affordable \nhousing, and cut support for our farmers by $3 billion.\n  Even worse, the House of Representatives is looking to make even \ndeeper cuts to Medicare and Medicaid and to cut the food stamp program, \nchild support enforcement, the foster care program, and student loan \nprograms.\n  These cuts will harm millions of Americans.\n  And why are the Republicans doing this? Not to reduce the deficit, \nwhich is spinning out of control, but to provide tax cuts for \nmillionaires that will at the end of the day actually increase the \ndeficit.\n  The tax portion of the reconciliation package will provide $70 \nbillion in tax breaks--$30 billion more than the proposed spending \ncuts. In a perversion of the budget reconciliation process, the \nRepublicans will be adding to, not decreasing, the Nation's $8 trillion \ndebt.\n  The majority of those $70 billion in tax breaks will go to the \nwealthy. People making over $1 million a year will get an average tax \ncut of $35,491. In comparison, those making between $50,000 to $200,000 \na year will get a break of $122. And those making less than $50,000 a \nyear will get an average tax cut of $6.\n  That means that people who are most hurt by the spending cuts--the \nmiddle class, seniors, and the poor--will get almost no benefit the tax \ncuts.\n  The reconciliation package also is a windfall for big oil. It would \nallow them to drill in one of American's most pristine areas--Alaska's \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge. Fragile wilderness will be opened, \nthreatened, and ultimately ruined for the sake of 6 months' worth of \noil.\n  What makes America the greatest Nation in the world is our sense of \ncommunity and compassion. Americans look out for each other, and our \ngovernment should do the same.\n  The budget reconciliation package reflects none of the core American \nvalues of compassion and equity. Instead,\n\n[[Page S12336]]\n\nit harms those who are most vulnerable in order to benefit the rich and \na handful of special interests.\n  For these reasons, I cannot support the budget reconciliation \nspending bill and will vote against it.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, Earlier today, an amendment I have worked \nclosely with Senator Dodd from Connecticut on was passed as part of the \nbudget reconciliation package. The amendment is based on legislation we \nintroduced which would provide a new, one-time screening benefit for \nabdominal aortic aneurysms, AAAs, under Medicare for certain, eligible \nbeneficiaries.\n  I am pleased this amendment was accepted, and I appreciate the hard \nwork from Senator Dodd in helping get this amendment passed. I hope \nthat we can continue working to ensure that this provision is included \nin the final reconciliation package.\n  AAAs occur when there is a weakening of the walls of the aorta, the \nbody's largest blood vessel. The artery begins to bulge and can lead to \na rupture and often severe internal bleeding. In cases where an artery \nruptures, the survival rate is less than 15 percent, and approximately \n15,000 people die from ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms each year.\n  When detected before rupturing, AAAs are treatable and curable in 95 \npercent of cases. Nearly all AAAs can be detected through an \ninexpensive ultrasound screening. Once detected, a physician can \nmonitor small aortic aneurysms and begin treating the risk factors, \nsuch as high blood pressure and smoking. Large or rapidly growing \naneurysms are often treated using either an open surgical procedure or \na less invasive stent graft, both of which serve to repair the artery.\n  It is estimated that between 5 to 7 percent of adults of the age of \n60 have AAAs.\n  Our amendment targets AAA screenings to Medicare beneficiaries with a \nfamily history and those who exhibit risk factors recommended for \nscreening by the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force, specifically \nmen who smoke. The amendment also limits screening to those eligible \nbeneficiaries who participate in the Welcome to Medicare Physical.\n  This amendment could save thousands of lives each year, and I am \npleased we were able to include it in this package.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am in reluctant but adamant opposition to \nthe reconciliation bill before us. I say reluctant, because I am glad \nto see the Senate using the reconciliation procedure for the purposes \nfor which it was intended: making difficult choices to reduce spending. \nAnd reluctant because some of the policy changes incorporated in this \nbill are necessary and worthy of the Senate's support.\n  One such provision relates to extension of the Milk Income Lost \nContract, MILC, program. MILC, which expired at the end of the last \nfiscal year, provides counter-cyclical support for the nation's dairy \nsector. It is targeted. It is fair. It is essential. Moreover, it \nenjoys the President's support. It makes sense as part of the balanced \nAgriculture package in this bill.\n  But my opposition to the entire package is adamant because this bill \nis just one piece of a fiscally and morally bankrupt budget. Though \nthis bill asks for sacrifices from seniors, students, farmers and \nworking families, the budget of which it is part will add over $30 \nbillion to the deficit over the next 5 years. Though this bill makes \nreal cuts in Medicaid, Medicare, aid to farmers and funding for \nconservation programs across the country, the budget of which it is \npart will add $3 trillion to the national debt by 2010.\n  If this bill was what many on the floor have argued--a carefully \ncrafted compromise to cut $39 billion from our growing federal deficit, \nI would have to think hard before opposing it. But the budget calls for \ntoday's bill to be followed with $70 billion tax cut, the bulk of which \nwill go to those with more than $1 million in annual income.\n  I am willing to make the hard choices to bring our budget deficit \ndown. I am not willing to support taking needed services away from \nthose that need them the most--and use those cuts as a fig leaf to hide \ntax breaks for those who need them the least.\n  Our budget is the most basic expression of what we stand for as a \ngovernment. Is this budget really what we want to vote to say? That we \nare the sort of country that threatens our own economic stability by \npiling deficit upon deficit? That we show our fiscal toughness by \nchopping aid to those in need? That we show our compassion only to \nthose whose biggest problem is finding a really good tax shelter for \ntheir growing capital gains?\n  Make no mistake, this bill is the first piece of the budget that says \njust that, and for that reason alone, it deserves our solid opposition. \nBut beyond that, there are individual provisions in this bill to which \nI take exception. One is the use of this bill's extraordinary fast \ntrack procedures to accomplish what big Oil's proponents have not been \nable to get through the Senate in the past: opening the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge to oil drilling.\n  I have long supported protecting this valuable and fragile natural \nwonder, and I think it is unfortunate that we are drilling in this \nwilderness for a relatively small payback. Those on the other side of \nthis issue who use the current high price of oil to justify the \nviolation of this pristine area are short sighted. According to the \nDepartment of Energy's own analysis the oil from the refuge will only \nlower the price of a barrel of oil by one penny. In addition, this oil \nwill not come on line for almost a decade. Instead of threatening our \nnatural heritage, I believe we should be looking instead at encouraging \nconservation efforts, and taking a careful look at high oil company \nprofits. We do need to act to lower our dependency on foreign oil, but \nwe cannot drill our way out of dependency.\n  I'm also particularly disappointed that the bill we are considering \ntoday contains harmful program cuts that would fall disproportionately \non the most vulnerable in our society. This legislation cuts funding \nfor health care provided through the Medicaid program, which provides \nhealth insurance to poor children, pregnant women, and elderly. My \nRepublican colleagues argue that we must cut waste and fraud in \nMedicaid and I am not opposed to that. However, I do not agree with the \narbitrary way they have gone about cutting funding from this critical \nsafety net program--without which millions of Americans would be \nuninsured--and using that money to pay for tax cuts for people with \nhigh incomes. I'm also concerned about the increased burden this bill \nplaces on seniors through additional cuts in the Medicare program and \nan increase in Medicare Part B premiums. I hope my colleagues will \nsupport several of the amendments offered today to help minimize the \nimpact these cuts could have on our Nation's elderly.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this bill--and the irresponsible and \ncruel budget of which it is part.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today truly alarmed about the \nadministration's fiscal irresponsibility. In the past 5 years, the \nPresident's policies have turned record surpluses into record deficits. \nJust a few weeks ago, the Department of Treasury announced that this \nyear's budget deficit is the third largest in history at $319 billion.\n  But, that is not where the bad story ends.\n  By sleight of hand, the administration continues to use other \nresources to finance debt, including foreign lenders and Social \nSecurity. The real deficit is a staggering $551 billion, 4.5 percent of \nGDP.\n  Administration officials are nonchalant about the fiscal disarray.\n  I am deeply worried. We all should be.\n  On October 18, the national debt passed the $8 trillion mark. Even \nmore disturbing, the national debt is being financed by Chinese, \nJapanese, and other overseas lenders. To put this into perspective, in \nabsolute dollars, the country is borrowing more than ever in its \nhistory, close to $2 trillion from foreign nations. We owe over $680 \nbillion to Japan, $390 billion to the European Union, $240 billion to \nChina, and $57 billion to OPEC nations, to name a few.\n  It is beyond me how this administration can turn a blind eye to these \nnumbers, or how Congress can approve legislation that exacerbates these \nfiscal problems.\n  Instead of facing up to the fiscal truth, President Bush ignores the \nmountain of debt that will burden generations to come.\n\n[[Page S12337]]\n\n  First, this President shortened the budget timeline from 10 years to \n5 years. Relying on this kind of gimmickry covers up for the \nPresident's destructive fiscal decisions, especially as they relate to \ntax cuts for the rich.\n  Second, this Republican Congress voted against a system to keep the \nbudget in balance. I am referring to the pay-go rule endorsed by \nFederal Chairman Alan Greenspan and former Secretary of Treasury Robert \nRubin. Pay-go would have required an offset for any decrease in \nrevenue. The method would have ensured a balanced approach to tax cuts. \nUnfortunately, Republican congressional leaders opted for shunting \naside integrity in budgeting. They back pay-go in name, but not in \npractice.\n  By any standard, the decisions to ignore a 10 year budget timeline \nand disregard balancing methods have caused massive red ink and send \nthe country precisely in the wrong direction.\n  In fact, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan put it this way:\n\n       The federal budget deficit is on an unsustainable path, in \n     which large deficits result in rising interest rates and \n     ever-growing interest payments that augment deficits in \n     future years . . . Unless this trend is reversed, at some \n     point these deficits will cause the economy to stagnate or \n     worse.\n\n  I fear this reconciliation package, coupled with the administration's \ntax cuts, will lead us to even worse times.\n  Reconciliation is simply asking too much of middle income families \nwho are facing cost increases for basic needs.\n  For instance, energy costs to heat one's home have increased 20 \npercent from last year. Education costs for public universities have \nincreased 7.1 percent. Interest rates that impact college loan payments \nhave doubled over the last 10 months. And, gas prices have increased 19 \npercent over the last 4 months.\n  Instead of assisting families with these increased costs, raising the \nstandard of living for the poor, or improving the opportunities to \nattain a college education, this package adds to financial pressures.\n  For health care alone, premiums have climbed higher than $10,000 for \nfamilies, and this bill will do nothing to reduce out-of-pocket health \ncare spending.\n  More perniciously, what the bill does do is cut $10 billion in health \ncare spending for the poorest Americans.\n  While the bill provides a 1-year temporary relief to physicians, a 1 \npercent increase in Medicare reimbursements is not enough. This is a \nBand-Aid fix, at best. When expenses to practice are increasing at a \nrate of 3 to 5 percent annually, a 1-year 1 percent increase in \nreimbursements is insufficient. In my State, where the cost of living \nis beyond the reach of many Californians, doctors are simply choosing \nnot to see any new Medicare patients or are retiring early due to low \nreimbursement levels.\n  To make matters worse, the temporary relief for physicians in the \nbill is borne on the back of Medicare beneficiaries in the form of \nhigher Part B premiums. This provision will directly increase the \namount Medicare beneficiaries pay each month in premiums by $2.90 in \n2007. That is a 33-percent increase in monthly premiums. While it is \nvital that Congress prevent future cuts in Medicare reimbursement to \nphysicians, the provision in this bill amounts to a $1.4 billion tax on \nseniors. That is unacceptable.\n  Further, it is no secret that increased debt puts pressure on \ninflation. In just this past year, the Federal Reserve enacted 11 \nconsecutive interest rate increases.\n  This means the American people will have to make higher mortgage \npayments, pay higher interest, and for those who own debt, it will take \neven longer to pay off their credit cards.\n  For some, this bill will put a college education out of reach. \nMiddle-income families, who have no choice but to borrow money for \ncollege, will struggle even more to pay tuition bills.\n  Due to increasing costs of basic needs, there are 1 million more \nAmericans living in poverty this year than there were last year. Not \nonly does this budget reconciliation do nothing to reduce that number, \nit puts many more Americans at risk of poverty due to higher health \ncare costs and reduced access to social services and education.\n  As for the environment, this reconciliation blatantly undermines the \nnatural wonders of our country. Shamefully, it opens the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge for drilling to already profit-soaked oil \ncompanies.\n  And, if that is not enough, this administration's fiscal policy \nforces our children to pay it all back--not only to the Social Security \nTrust Fund, but to foreign nations.\n  At any point, foreign countries can stop investing in the dollar, and \nany small movement could have a significant and immediate impact on the \nfiscal stability of our Nation's currency.\n  Does this Congress believe it is good foreign policy to put our \neconomic interests and security in the hands of China, Japan, and the \nEuropean Union?\n  Let me be clear, this budget reconciliation is asking Americans to: \npay more in interest payments, pay more in health care premiums without \nimproving benefits, borrow more from foreign lenders, further damage \nour habitat and environment, and leave an even larger bill for future \ngenerations to pay.\n  We should be talking about helping American families, not punishing \nthem with new financial burdens. And, for what good reason? None \nwhatsoever.\n  The Bush administration's Pavlovian response to everything that ills \nthe economy is: tax cuts--not to middle- and low-income families, who \nneed it most, but, instead, to the wealthiest Americans.\n  The wealthiest Americans have received tax cuts that are 140 times \nthe size of the average tax cut for middle-income families. That means \nmillionaires have received an average tax break of $100,000 a year \nwhile middle-income families have received a mere $742.\n  Let me be frank, the President's tax cuts do not help working \nAmericans. In fact, the after-inflation wages of the average American \nearners have dropped for the first time in a decade.\n  Meanwhile, the President's tax cuts account for 57 percent of the \ndeficit increase. In fact, President Bush's tax cuts are more expensive \nthan all spending increases combined, including new spending for \nhomeland security, the war in Iraq, operations in Afghanistan, expanded \nantiterrorism efforts, and all domestic spending increases. It is a \nfiscal record of excess and recklessness.\n  And without batting an eye, this President goes right along, \nreiterating his intention of making tax cuts permanent--at a cost of \n$11 trillion over 75 years--making it clear that even in the wake of \nhurricanes, rising gas prices, increasing interest rates, and higher \nhealth care costs, this administration will continue to push for lining \nthe pockets of the wealthy.\n  I believe we can do better. I believe we can bring fiscal \nresponsibility back to the budget process and help middle-income \nfamilies. We have done it in the past. We can do it now.\n  In 1982, Ronald Reagan agreed to undo a significant share of tax cuts \nto combat substantial budget deficits.\n  Ten years later, President George H.W. Bush changed his position on \ntaxes and signed a bipartisan deficit-reduction package.\n  More recently, in the late 1990s, after inheriting a national deficit \ntotaling 4.7 percent of GDP, the Clinton administration turned deficits \ninto our first budget surpluses since 1969.\n  Today, with the national deficit including trust fund accounts \nreaching 4.5 percent of GDP, it is time to do the same.\n  In the words of Former Secretary of Treasury Robert Rubin:\n\n       We are at a critical juncture with respect to the longer-\n     term future of our economy, and the outcome at this juncture \n     will be enormously affected--for good or for ill--by the \n     policy action we take in response to the great issues we \n     face.\n\n  It is time to have the courage to act responsibly. This so called \ndeficit reduction package is not what it claims to be. Yes, it will cut \nspending by more than $30 billion, but in a few weeks these savings \nwill be spent on tax breaks for the rich. In the end, this \nreconciliation package titled ``Deficit Reduction'' will actually \nincrease the deficit by $36 billion. This fiscal strategy edges us \ncloser to fiscal insanity and leaves our children and their children \nimpoverished and riddled with debt. The first step to doing better is \nvoting no on this reconciliation bill.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, in order to meet its reconciliation \ninstructions, the Banking Committee\n\n[[Page S12338]]\n\nrecommended that S. 1562, the Safe and Fair Deposit Insurance Act of \n2005 be included in the banking title of the budget reconciliation \nbill.\n  Earlier this year, I joined with Senators Enzi, Hagel, and Allard in \nintroducing this important legislation which has garnered strong \nbipartisan support and was overwhelmingly approved by the Banking \nCommittee last month. Additionally, it has the strong support of the \nadministration, Treasury Department, the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation, and the financial services industry.\n  Deposit insurance is one of the cornerstones of our country's \nfinancial system. It protects depositors against risks they cannot \ncontrol, ensures stability, and allows deposits to remain in our local \ncommunities. This important legislation will ensure that deposit \ninsurance maintains its strength even during times of economic \nweakness.\n  Borne out of the need to promote financial stability during the Great \nDepression, deposit insurance has served depositors well by providing \nstability to banks and to the economy, and it is especially critical to \nour Nation's smaller financial institutions and community banks.\n  While there have been differing opinions as to how deposit insurance \nshould be reformed, there is general agreement that the system needs to \nbe reformed and modernized. The banking industry is rapidly evolving \nand is becoming increasingly complex and sophisticated. Yet the last \ntime any change was made to our system of deposit insurance was over 20 \nyears ago. Reform is long overdue. The time has come for the system \nthat was put in place to promote the stability of the banking system be \nappropriately reformed to keep pace with the evolution of that system.\n  Depositors must have confidence that their hard-earned money is \nprotected, including the funds that cover their daily living expenses \nto the funds they are saving for retirement and a rainy day. To that \nend, this legislation introduces some very key reforms.\n  First, it merges the bank insurance fund with the savings association \ninsurance fund to create the deposit insurance fund. By doing so, we \ncreate a stronger and more diversified fund, and eliminate the \npossibility for disparities in premiums between banks and thrifts.\n  Second, insurance premiums will be risk-based to ensure that banks \npay based on the risk they pose to the system, and the FDIC will be \nable to price insurance premiums accordingly. The current system does \nnot allow for premium assessments to be based on risk, and therefore, \nsafer banks are subsidizing riskier banks. This inflexibility will be \neliminated and the assessment burden will be distributed more evenly \nand fairly over time. When deposit insurance is priced for risk, \nwhether the coverage limit is higher or lower is less relevant. Banks \nwill have to pay higher premiums for riskier behavior, reducing any \nmoral hazard. It is important to note, however, that in developing a \nnew risk based premium system, the FDIC should not negatively impact \nthe cost of homeownership or community credit by charging higher \npremiums to institutions simply because they fund mortgages and other \ntypes of lending through advances from Federal Home Loan Banks. \nCongress reaffirmed this relationship between community lenders and \nHome Loan Banks most recently in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and \ndeposit insurance reform is not intended to impose any financial cost \non the relationship through direct or indirect premiums.\n  Third, the FDIC will have the discretion to periodically index \ncoverage levels for both general and retirement accounts to keep pace \nwith inflation. This is a compromise made in order to secure the Bush \nadministration's support. Frankly, I feel some form of automatic \nindexation would be far preferable, and I am disappointed that \nindexation is left as a discretionary matter. The real value of deposit \ninsurance coverage is now less than half of what it was in 1980 when it \nwas set at $100,000. By increasing the level of coverage for retirement \naccounts, we are adjusting for the real value of coverage. Insuring \nretirement accounts up to $250,000 will keep the coverage level up with \ninflation and will promote financial stability for individual retirees. \nRetirement accounts are the only accounts under this bill that will get \na higher coverage level. I believe in the current environment, with the \nuncertainty surrounding social security and pension benefits, that it \nis critical that we provide appropriate coverage for the hard-working \nAmericans who have saved for their retirement and long-term care needs. \nThis legislation strikes the appropriate balance in that regard.\n  Finally, I would be remiss if I did not recognize the banking \ncommunity in South Dakota for the invaluable and critical role they \nhave played in this process over the past 5 years. I truly appreciate \nthe input and recommendations that I have received from the industry \noverall. I would also like to thank Chairman Shelby, and Ranking Member \nSarbanes for their leadership, Senators Enzi, Hagel and Allard for the \nmany hours of hard work, and FDIC Chairman Don Powell for his \ncommitment to deposit insurance reform.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I voice my opposition to the \nreconciliation bill before the Senate today. America can and should do \nbetter. This bill, which masquerades as a vehicle to help shrink the \ndeficit, is actually a part of a broader, fiscally irresponsible \npackage of policy and legislation that will actually increase the size \nof the deficit by over $30 billion in the next 5 years, even as this \nbill cuts programs that are important to the most vulnerable Americans. \nIn other words, this series of proposals moves America in exactly the \nwrong direction.\n  This bill moves in the wrong direction when it comes to agriculture. \nAgriculture program spending amounts to about 1 percent of the spending \nin the Federal budget, however, at a time when fuel prices are at a \nrecord high and many rural areas in Colorado across the country \ncontinue to feel the effects of weather-related natural disasters, \nagriculture programs have been forced to take $3 billion worth of cuts. \nThese cuts will come out of the programs that farmers, ranchers and \nrural communities count on most, including commodity program payments \nand conservation programs like the Conservation Reserve Program, CRP. \nDuring my time in the Senate I have spoken many times about my concern \nthat too often Washington leaves our rural communities to wither on the \nvine. I believe that this budget reconciliation package only \ncontributes to their decline.\n  This bill moves in the wrong direction when it comes to health care \nand education. The bill cuts college student aid by over $7 billion, \ncreating less opportunity for young Americans when we should be in the \nbusiness of creating more. It makes deep Medicaid and Medicare cuts, \nhurting the poor, elderly, and disabled who struggle with healthcare \ncosts. Because of this bill, seniors will see a 33 percent increase in \npremiums for Medicare Part B. Because of this bill, independent, \ncommunity pharmacies, particularly in rural areas, will see a change in \nreimbursement formulas that could force them to close their doors, \nfurther eroding access to health care in this country.\n  This bill moves in the wrong direction when it comes to the \nenvironment and to energy policy. It would open the pristine Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling. Ultimately, this fight is not \nabout barrels of oil, it's about the deeper moral decisions we make as \na nation about how best to address our energy needs. Drilling for oil \nin the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge won't do a thing for gas prices \nthis winter. It won't do a thing for gas prices in 10 years or even 15 \nyears. In fact, it won't do a thing for energy prices ever, because \neven if this provision passes and becomes law, the total amount of \n``technically recoverable oil,'' according to the administration's own \nestimates, would reduce gas prices by only a penny--and then, not \nbefore 10 to 15 years from now.\n  This reconciliation bill does not reflect the right budget \npriorities. This bill tightens the squeeze already being felt by so \nmany hardworking Americans trying to make ends meet as oil and gas \nprices soar and winter approaches. Adding insult to injury, these \nirresponsible cuts will not even help the country with the bottom line, \nbecause they are being combined with tax breaks for the wealthiest \nAmericans that exceed, by tens of billions of dollars, the value of the \ncuts themselves. The average benefit of these tax\n\n[[Page S12339]]\n\nbreaks for those with incomes more than $1 million would be $35,491. \nBut for those with incomes under $50,000, the average benefit comes to \n$6. America can do better.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, earlier this year I voted against the \nbudget resolution that passed the Congress because it reflected the \nwrong priorities. That budget resolution short changed vital public \nneeds such as education and health care for all Americans in order to \nfurther cut taxes mainly for the wealthiest Americans. The bill before \nus today is the first part of a three-part budget reconciliation \nprocess set up to help carry out that misguided budget. Budget \nreconciliation is a special process that gives privileged short cuts \nunder the rules of the Senate. For many of the same reasons that I \nopposed the original budget resolution, I must also oppose this \nreconciliation bill. Instead of improving our fiscal situation, the \nreconciliation package worsens the problem.\n  This first of the three reconciliation bills is focused on spending \ncuts. It cuts funding for Medicaid, Medicare, low-income housing grants \nand other important programs. These cuts, along with the revenue that \ncould be generated as a result of a shortsighted decision to drill in \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, ANWR, in Alaska, are projected to \nreduce the deficit by $39.1 billion over the next 5 years.\n  However, at the same time, both Houses of Congress are working on \nseparate versions of the second part of the reconciliation package--the \ntax bill. That bill would extend $70 billion worth of tax cuts \nbenefiting largely the wealthiest Americans. It simply does not make \nsense to say we need to cut $39.1 billion out of vital programs to \nreduce the deficit while at the same time increasing the deficit with \n$70 billion in tax cuts. These bills continue an irresponsible and \ninequitable tax policy that recklessly adds to our deficit.\n  The third part of this three-part reconciliation process will be a \nbill to allow the national debt to increase by another $781 billion. \nThe need for that third bill shows how dreadful our budget situation \nhas become. The U.S. national debt has already climbed above $8 \ntrillion. In the fiscal year that just ended, we spent over $350 \nbillion just to pay the interest on that debt. That is 14 percent of \nthe Federal Government's spending last year. That is money that doesn't \ngo toward important infrastructure improvements, homeland security or \nother priorities like health care, education or environmental \nprotection. We simply cannot afford to continue building up this \nmassive debt.\n  Not only is it financially irresponsible to add to this already heavy \ndebt, but it adds risk to our national security. Forty-four percent of \nour national debt is held by foreign investors. If these investors ever \ndecide, for economic or political reasons, to stop financing our debt, \nour markets could be severely impacted. This can provide other \ncountries with greater leverage during trade or other negotiations with \nus.\n  In addition to the fiscal irresponsibility in this reconciliation \npackage, it is unconscionable that this body would once again decide to \ncut services for the poor and the disabled and the elderly and \ndisadvantaged children and then to turn around next week and provide \nthe mostly the wealthiest Americans with $70 billion of tax cuts. I \nwill say at the outset, this bill contains some good provisions. This \nbill halts an unwise looming 4.4 percent decrease for physicians \ntreating Medicare patients and instead provides a 1 percent increase. \nThis bill was amended and now contains a provision that will prevent a \nreduction in Federal money for Michigan Medicaid. This bill also has \nseveral provisions to help victims of Hurricane Katrina.\n  However, a large portion of the spending cuts in this reconciliation \nbill impacts the millions of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries as \nwell as providers. This is not the first time Congress has attempted to \nbalance the budget on the backs of people who rely on Medicare and \nMedicaid. In 1997, Congress cuts payments to providers and services to \nbeneficiaries and the cuts were overreaching. It is my fear the same \nresult will come from our actions today. This bill before us cuts \nreimbursement for several types of Medicare providers including nursing \nfacilities, hospitals and managed care. This bill also places caps on \npayments for Medicare and Medicaid services. People who rely on \nMedicare and Medicaid are going to be hurt by this bill. I hope that my \ncolleagues take a long look at by how much the bad outweighs the good \nin this bill.\n  In addition, I also regret that the majority decided to include in \nthis budget reconciliation the opening of the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge, ANWR, to oil and gas development.\n  I have consistently opposed opening ANWR to oil and gas development \nbecause I believe it is the wrong approach to addressing our Nation's \nneed for long-term energy security. The actual reserves in the area \nthat will be available for leasing under this provision are too small \nto have a significant impact on our Nation's energy independence and \nwill not produce any oil for more than a decade. I do not believe that \nthis limited potential for oil and gas development in ANWR warrants \nendangering what is one of the last remaining pristine wilderness areas \nin the United States.\n  But, also, the process for consideration of ANWR on the budget \nreconciliation bill has been flawed from the start. Including this \nimportant issue in the budget reconciliation bill has short-circuited \nthe normal legislative process and has eliminated the opportunity for \nCongress to give the issue the consideration it deserves. In fact, this \nissue was not even considered when the Senate debated the Energy Policy \nAct of 2005 for 2 weeks this past summer. Opening ANWR to oil and gas \ndevelopment was not considered on the Energy bill because the votes \nwere not there to pass it except by including it in the budget \nreconciliation bills that we are considering now.\n  On a positive note, I am pleased that I was able to include language \nin this bill that recognizes the needs of border States when awarding \nemergency and interoperable communications grants.\n  First responders in border States like Michigan, New Mexico, and \nMinnesota face unique challenges and must be able to communicate with a \nnumber of Federal, State, and local entities including FEMA, Customs \nand Border Protection, and the National Guard in addition to police, \nfirefighters and emergency medical services personnel from other \njurisdictions who may assist in the event of a large scale disaster or \nterrorist attack. What is often overlooked is that first responders \nnear border crossings must also be able to maintain seamless \ncommunication with their Canadian or Mexican counterparts across the \nborder. My amendment would assist our first responders by creating \ndemonstration projects at our northern and southern borders. The \namendment provides that the Secretary of Homeland Security shall \nestablish at least two International Border Community Interoperable \nCommunications Demonstration Projects--with at least one of these \ndemonstration projects on each of the northern and southern borders. \nThese interoperable communications demonstrations will address the \ninteroperable communications needs of police officers, firefighters, \nemergency medical technicians, National Guard, and other emergency \nresponse providers at our borders.\n  In closing, I sincerely hope that future budgets coming from this \nbody will be more responsible than this one. Furthermore, as imprudent \nas this bill is, I hope it won't be made worse in conference after \nmerging with the even more misguided House bill. Major bipartisan \nefforts will be needed to make true progress on the long-term fiscal \nproblems we face. I will continue to fight for fair and fiscally \nresponsible policies that help generate jobs and economic security from \nwhich all Americans can benefit.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this past March, I stood here to express my \nreluctant support for the fiscal year 2006 concurrent budget \nresolution. My support was reluctant for one reason only. I believed \nthe budget did not go far enough in slowing the growth of Federal \nspending.\n  My colleagues will remember that passing that budget resolution was \nnot an easy thing. Both the original Senate version and the conference \nreport passed by very narrow margins. Not one Democrat voted in favor \nof the budget resolution, so it was left up to those of us on this side \nof the aisle to pass that resolution.\n\n[[Page S12340]]\n\n  The major reason why the budget was so difficult to pass was the \ninherent problem in getting a majority to agree on legislation that \ncuts the growth in spending for entitlement programs. Entitlement \nprograms are those that grow automatically without any action from \nCongress. While they are many of the most important programs in the \nGovernment, they are also the most expensive. Some Senators wanted more \ncuts in spending growth than did others, and it was hard to get a \nconsensus, especially when there was absolutely no support from the \nother side.\n  Nevertheless, we did manage to pass the budget resolution, which was \nthe first step in the process we are trying to complete here tonight \nwith the budget reconciliation bill. This bill ``reconciles'' the \nspending in the budget with the programmatic changes necessary to \nachieve the budget numbers. And while the projected spending growth in \nthis budget over the next few years is still alarming, the cuts in that \ngrowth included in this bill are very much a good first step in the \nright direction.\n  What Senator Gregg, the chairman of the Budget Committee, emphasized \nin his opening remarks is very significant. This is the first time \nsince 1997 that Congress has attempted to restrain the growth of \nentitlement spending programs. I think we can conclude that although \nthe magnitude of the change is not as large as many of us would like to \nsee, the directional change is very important.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, this reconciliation \nbill would reduce federal outlays by more than $39 billion over the \nnext 5 years and by almost $109 billion over the next 10 years. I \nrealize that many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are \nscoffing at the idea these numbers are not large enough in terms of \nreducing the deficit. Why, then, are we not seeing any spending \nreduction proposals from them? It is because it is much easier to throw \nrocks at our attempts to rein in spending growth than it is to make the \nhard choices themselves.\n  Rather than having an honest debate about how best to deal with out-\nof-control budgets, most of what we are hearing from our friends on the \nother side is the same old tiresome accusation that we are reducing \nspending for lower-income Americans so that we can cut taxes, once \nagain, for those Americans who are wealthy and do not need a tax \nreduction. This, of course, is a gross distortion of the truth.\n  As Chairman Gregg has pointed out, the spending growth reductions in \nthis bill are not directed at low-income individuals. We worked very \nhard to make sure that was the case, especially in the Finance \nCommittee which has jurisdiction over such important safety-net \nprograms as Medicaid.\n  Indeed, the bill includes a significant amount of new spending. The \namount of this new spending, some of which I recognize is necessary, is \none of the problems I have with the bill. In addition, a great deal of \nthe deficit reduction in this bill is achieved by raising fees or \nselling a portion of the broadcast spectrum. That being said, I will \ndetail some of my specific objections about this in a little while.\n  As to criticisms about so-called tax cuts, there are not any in this \nbill. The tax reconciliation bill comes later, after this bill has \npassed. And the tax provisions that will be in that bill are generally \nin the nature of preventing tax increases on the middle class, not tax \ncuts for the wealthy. Moreover, most of those provisions enjoy broad \nsupport on both sides of the aisle.\n  Do I believe this reconciliation bill is perfect? Far from it.\n  Do I think we could have and should have done more in trimming the \nspending growth of entitlement programs? Absolutely.\n  As I mentioned before, the significance of this bill is not in the \namount of deficit reduction it delivers, but in the change in direction \nthat it represents. I hope we can pass it and then use it as a building \nblock for more deficit reduction next year.\n  We have only a few short years to make much larger changes in our \nentitlement spending programs. All of us know that they are on an \nupward trajectory that is simply not sustainable. Passing this \nreconciliation bill now begins to turn the tide. It sets the stage for \nmore responsible spending. With a smart mix of pro-growth policies that \nwill help ensure continued economic growth and future spending \nrestraint, we can begin to lower the deficit and put our budget in a \ncondition to withstand the storms ahead.\n  Now, I would like to take the time to get into some of the details of \nthe changes included in the bill by the three committees on which I \nserve.\n  As a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, I worked hard \nwith Chairman Grassley to ensure that our Committee met the goal of \nfinding $10 billion in savings. Unfortunately, the Finance package also \nspends a significant amount of money when I believe that our national \nfocus needs to be on saving money. Some of it is necessary. Some not.\n  And, I am very troubled by how we are paying for this spending. Close \nto $5 billion comes from eliminating the MedicareAdvantage Regional \nPlan Stabilization Fund, something I strongly oppose. The stabilization \nfund is a critical component to facilitating regional Preferred \nProvider Organizations, PPOs, in the Medicare Advantage program, thus \nproviding these plans to beneficiaries throughout the country, \nparticularly in rural areas.\n  The MMA has made Medicare Advantage plans more widely available with \ngreater beneficiary savings than ever before, including in rural areas \nand many other areas that previously were not served by Medicare \nAdvantage plans.\n  Since the MMA was enacted in 2003, there has been a large increase in \nthe availability of Medicare Advantage health plans that provide \nadditional benefits and corresponding reductions in total health care \ncosts. For example, in rural areas where there has historically been \nminimal managed care available, there are now three regional PPOs \noffering an integrated package of medical and prescription drug \nbenefits with extra coverage at lower prices, one of these regional \nPPOs even offers a zero drug deductible.\n  The stabilization fund will help make it possible to provide secure \naccess to these new, lower-cost coverage options in underserved areas. \nWhile more Medicare beneficiaries than ever will have regional Medicare \nAdvantage options in 2006, further progress is needed for people with \nMedicare in 13 States, specifically: my home state of Utah; Alaska; \nColorado; Connecticut; Idaho; Maine; Massachusetts; New Hampshire; New \nMexico; Oregon; Rhode Island; Vermont; and Washington.\n  When developing the MMA, the Congress recognized that some states \nmight not be served by regional Medicare Advantage plans in the initial \nyears of the program and strategically created the benefit \nstabilization fund, which sunsets in 2013, to encourage plans to \noperate in all areas of the Nation. Utah is one of those States and \nthat is why I strongly supported the creation of the stabilization fund \nduring the MMA negotiations.\n  The stabilization fund helps to make sure that, in future years, \nplans will choose to serve the people with Medicare who do not have \nMedicare Advantage options in 2006. And, conversely, repealing the \nfund, or cutting its revenues, means reduced benefits and higher costs \nfor these seniors in future years.\n  Many Medicare Advantage plans are already serving Medicare \nbeneficiaries with some very generous benefit offerings for 2006, with \nthe expectation that there would be stability in the program. For the \nhealth plans that are interested in potentially providing this regional \nPPO coverage, it is essential for them to know that they will get some \nhelp with starting up if they need it in areas that had been \nunderserved before, and that the Medicare program will keep their \npayments predictable.\n  If Congress and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, \nstart cutting promised funding and/or changing program rules even \nbefore the first benefit is administered, we send a very negative \nsignal to plans, and that may mean worse coverage options and higher \ncosts for Medicare beneficiaries in the future.\n  Cuts to or reductions in the stabilization fund, and therefore, \npayments to regional plans amount to adding costs for beneficiaries in \nthe form of higher premiums, reduced benefits, or both. Without this \nfund, it will be difficult to convince plans to offer coverage to \nbeneficiaries who currently do not have access to regional PPOs.\n\n[[Page S12341]]\n\n  Maintaining the current stabilization fund will encourage more \nregional PPOs to enter the Medicare Advantage program and make sure \nthat significantly more people, including my fellow Utahns, have access \nto Medicare Advantage plans next year.\n  I do not understand why we would be eliminating this fund, especially \nbefore the Medicare drug plan program is even operational. It just does \nnot make good policy sense and that is why I oppose the elimination.\n  This is especially vexing given that there are a number of other \nsources for revenue. I will be fighting for more extensive restrictions \non asset transfers and the inclusion of provisions which would prohibit \nintergovernmental transfers. Including these provisions would have \nseverely curtailed activities where individuals and some State \ngovernments have intentionally defrauded the Medicaid program.\n  I have heard the arguments about why we should not have included them \nin the proposal, but I do not buy those arguments. More aggressive \nlegislating in these areas would preclude some of the other reductions \nnecessitated in this bill, such as those for the stabilization fund.\n  The provisions on payment for prescription drugs under the Medicaid \nprogram are another deep concern of mine. These have only been made \nworse by adoption of amendments in the Chamber. Let me say that while I \nagree that changes are warranted, I am very worried about the approach \nincluded in the bill. I am not sure that the new definitions created \nfor Average Manufacturer's Price, AMP, Weighted Average Manufacturer's \nPrice, WAMP, and the new formula which were created for the Federal \nUpper Payment Limit, FUPL, will address the criticisms of the current \npolicy. In fact, these new definitions could make the situation worse. \nI am also troubled that the genesis of these changes was not a desire \nfor good policy, but rather an interest in seeking funding from a \n``deep pocket.'' That trend was only exacerbated during Senate \nconsideration of the Finance title, as we added two rebate-related \namendments with spending implications that totaled several billions of \ndollars more.\n  It is clear to me that, as consideration of the conference report \nbegins, we must continue discussions with the various stakeholders who \nhave a vested interest in making this policy work, in particular, the \npharmacists and the pharmaceutical companies.\n  The budget resolution contained a reconciliation instruction \ndirecting the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, HELP \nCommittee, on which I serve, to reduce spending by $13.7 billion in 5 \nyears. We on the HELP Committee worked very hard to achieve this goal, \nwhich required difficult spending vs. savings decisions.\n  Within the past months, as we wrote reauthorizing language for the \nWorkforce Investment Act, WIA, Head Start, the Perkins Act, career and \ntechnical education, and the Higher Education Act, HEA, we kept in mind \nthe need to meet the reduction in spending goals. Each of these \nreauthorization bills was unanimously approved in committee.\n  While I recognize the tough choices we needed to make, I am pleased \noverall with the reconciliation bill as it relates to education \nprovisions, accounting for a total savings of $9.8 billion. Spending \nincreases in the bill include increases in Pell grants, along with \nProGAP, a new grant assistance to Pell eligible students.\n  Another new program, SMART grants, would provide assistance to \nstudents studying math, science, technology, engineering, or a foreign \nlanguage. Subsidized borrowing levels were increased, along with a \npermanent extension of the Taxpayer-Teacher Protection Act. Additional \nloan deferments were made for members of the Armed Services or the \nreserves. These programs would give Utah students, particularly those \nof low or moderate income, greater access to college educations and \nwill boast our local and national economy as we seek to meet the \ndemands of the 21st century workforce.\n  Significant savings were found in student loans, mostly from lending \ninstitutions, including a requirement for guaranty agencies to deposit \none percent of their collections in the Federal Reserve fund, a \nreduction in lender insurance and repeal of the provision that \nguarantees 100 percent of loans for certain lenders. An additional fee \nis charged for lenders originating consolidation loans, and permanent \nrestrictions are made on transfer or refunding of certain tax-exempt \nbonds that receive a 9.5 percent rate of return.\n  I have concerns about last-minute changes to include major spending \nincreases, even though they appear to have been reconciled by savings. \nHowever, my colleagues should know that I am paying particular \nattention to fixing the interest rate for undergraduate and graduate \nnon-consolidation borrowing at 6.8 percent, preferring a choice of a \nvariable rate similar to the House provision. I am also concerned about \nthe way certain bills are structured that are currently before the \nSenate that deal with the inclusion of Katrina public and private \nschool payments.\n  The HELP Committee also included provisions increasing significantly \nthe amounts of premiums employers that sponsor defined benefit pension \nplans must pay to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, PBGC. \nThese increases were larger than they needed to be, and represent \nplaceholders until we can pass the pension reform bill that was \nproduced by the Finance and HELP Committees. I hope we will soon be \nable to consider and pass that legislation, partly for the reason of \nreducing these premium increases to more reasonable amounts.\n  The Judiciary Committee greatly exceeded its reconciliation targets, \nand I applaud that accomplishment even though I do not support the \nmeans by which it was achieved. Federal spending is out of control and, \nas my colleagues know, this has been a concern of mine for a long time. \nI am gratified to see that so many others now share my concerns and, \nmore importantly, that we are finally doing something about \nirresponsible spending despite the efforts of a few members on the \nother side of the aisle to scuttle this reconciliation bill.\n  I am pleased that the Judiciary Committee did not report a proposed \ntax on the explosives industry. It was just plain wrong, and it would \nhave hurt a lot of people in Utah. Naturally, I fought tooth and nail \nto make sure it was off the table and I, along with others, succeeded \nin stopping it.\n  This brings us to the current Judiciary title. I do not think we \nshould have used a reconciliation measure to alter immigration policy, \nparticularly in light of the current debate on comprehensive \nimmigration reform. For this, and other reasons, I offered an amendment \nthat would have imposed a 5 percent increase in all immigration related \nfees instead of simply allowing more people into the country as a way \nof reducing our Nation's deficit. Unfortunately, my amendment was \ndefeated in committee.\n  That being said, I recognize that it is not easy to come up with \nsavings. It means tough choices. But it is our job to make the tough \ncalls and the Judiciary Committee did just that.\n  I strongly support moving this package through the Senate. However, I \nwant my colleagues to understand my concerns and that I intend to \ncontinue working with them on improving the package. I know this was an \nextremely difficult task, and I appreciate all the hard work of many of \nmy colleagues, and particularly the chairmen of the committees on which \nI serve.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Senate will vote shortly on final \npassage of S. 1932. We have had a good debate on this bill. I commend \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee for his effective and fair \nmanagement of the consideration of this bill this week.\n  The Senate Finance Committee title was carefully crafted to address a \nwide range of member priorities. The Senate Finance Committee title is \na compromise--one that was meticulously negotiated over many months. It \nrepresents clear-headed, commonsense reforms.\n  But here is something that should make a lot of people wonder what is \ngoing on around here. I noted with interest a recent Washington Post \narticle which notes:\n\n       The Senate package is gaining kudos from some unlikely \n     sources. Liberal budget and antipoverty groups say the Senate \n     budget-cutting legislation largely avoids cuts that will hit \n     low-income beneficiaries . . .\n\n  And here is another one. The Associated Press reports:\n\n       As a result, the Senate's Medicare and Medicaid cuts \n     largely won't touch beneficiaries of the programs, instead \n     tapping\n\n[[Page S12342]]\n\n     drug companies, pharmacies and insurance subsidies for much \n     of the savings.\n\n  I am therefore somewhat confused why more of my friends and \ncolleagues from the Democratic side are not going to support final \npassage of this bill. I think I know partly what the answer is--is it \nbecause the House version of this bill is much more far-reaching than \nthe Senate proposal? Is it because the same groups that praise the \nSenate bill oppose the process moving forward on that basis?\n  I would make the point that I think the Senate's position in going to \nconference with the House would be strengthened if S. 1932 passed with \nstrong bipartisan support. I do not understand why the liberal budget \ngroups are not urging Democrats to unite in support of the Senate bill.\n  I believe that the American people want us to join together to get \nthings done. They want us to get our fiscal house in order, but they \nalso want us to enact compassionate policies that help honest-to-\ngoodness working families. The Senate bill meets both of those \npriorities. Here is the bottom line, and I want all my friends on the \nother side of the aisle to hear this. Here is what a vote against the \nSenate bill we have before us today means. Opposition to the Senate \nbill's balanced approach to Medicaid reform and program improvements is \nopposition to achieving savings, preserving services, and protecting \nbeneficiaries.\n  A ``no'' vote is a vote against cutting wasteful spending in Medicaid \nand other changes that provide additional resources to State Medicaid \nprograms.\n  A ``no'' vote is a vote against having the State and Federal \nGovernment pay less for drugs.\n  A ``no'' vote is a vote against tightening up asset transfers, \nthereby paying less for nursing home care through Medicaid.\n  A ``no'' vote is a vote against increasing State and Federal payments \nfrom drug companies.\n  A ``no'' vote is a vote against a $2 billion windfall to the States.\n  Opposition to the Senate bill's balanced approach to Medicaid reform \nand program improvements is opposition to the bipartisan Family \nOpportunity Act.\n  So that means that a ``no'' vote is a vote against the Family \nOpportunity Act's expansion of Medicaid eligibility for severely \ndisabled children. Opposition to this provision means forcing many \nworking families to refuse better jobs or promotions--keeping them poor \nin order to qualify for Medicaid or, worse, relinquish custody of their \ndisabled child to the State so that their child can continue to get the \nservices they need.\n  A ``no'' vote is also a vote against the Family Opportunity Act's \nprotection for families whose newborn is diagnosed with a severe \ndisability from being liable for thousands of dollars of medical costs.\n  A ``no'' vote is a vote against ``Money Follows the Person,'' which \nprovides grants to States to increase the use of home and community \nbased services, rather than institutional services. ``Money Follows the \nPerson'' also eliminates barriers so that individuals can receive \nsupport for long-term services in the settings of their choice.\n  Opposition to the Senate bill's balanced approach to Medicaid reform \nand program improvements is opposition to a down payment on Hurricane \nKatrina disaster relief.\n  So that means that a ``no'' vote is a vote against providing $1.8 \nbillion to protect Medicaid benefits in Alabama, Louisiana, and \nMississippi for people affected by Hurricane Katrina.\n  Opposition to the Senate bill's balanced approach to Medicaid reform \nand program improvements is opposition to protecting health coverage \nfor thousands of children and improving the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program.\n  A ``no'' vote is a vote against preventing funding shortfalls in the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program in 23 States.\n  A ``no'' vote is a vote against providing new options for private \ncoverage of long-term care through Long-term Care Partnerships.\n  A ``no'' vote also means opposition to closing loopholes that permit \nthe unscrupulous ``gaming'' of Medicaid eligibility rules to \nintentionally shelter assets to qualify for taxpayer-financed long-term \ncare coverage in Medicaid.\n  Those who vote against this bill are also opposing the Senate bill's \nbalanced approach to Medicaid reform and program improvements is \nopposition to protecting access for rural beneficiaries.\n  So that means that a ``no'' vote is a vote against protecting small \nrural hospitals and sole community hospitals by extending the hold-\nharmless provisions that protect them from losses resulting from \nimplementation of the hospital outpatient prospective payment system.\n  A ``no'' vote is also opposition to extending the Medicare Dependent \nHospital Program, which provides financial protections to rural \nhospitals with less than 100 beds that have a greater than 60 percent \nshare of Medicare patients.\n  A ``no'' vote also means opposition to expanding coverage of \nadditional preventive benefits under Federal Qualified Health Centers.\n  Why would my Democratic colleagues oppose such commonsense, practical \npolicies that save the States money, expand access for low income and \ndisabled children, help rural hospitals and make progress to \nrebalancing the institutional bias in the Medicaid program?\n  I am saddened that it appears my colleagues cannot put partisan \npolitics aside and get behind a bill that saves money for States, \nprotects and expands access, and preserves benefits. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Senate bill. Let's show the American people \nthat we can put politics aside and stand together and get things done \nfor the good of the country.\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, at this time, we have come to the end of \nthe amendment process. I now ask, before we go to final passage, we \nhave 5 minutes equally divided between myself and Senator Conrad, and \nthen we will go to final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the staffs, the very \nprofessional staffs on both sides. I especially thank the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee for his professionalism and his diligence in \nworking on this bill. He has been such a pleasure to work with. His \nword is gold.\n  I appreciate very much his staff, as well--Scott Gudes, Gail Millar, \nJim Hearn, Cheri Reidy, and the rest of the majority staff.\n  I want to also thank my staff--Mary Naylor, John Righter, my counsel \nLisa Konwinski, Jim Esquea, Sarah Kuehl, Mike Jones, Cliff Isenberg, \nJim Miller, Kobye Noel, Shelley Amdur, Steve Baily, Rock Cheung, Dana \nHalvorson, Tyler Haskell, Jim Klumpner, Jamie Morin, Stu Nagurka, Anne \nPage, Steve Posner, and David Vandivier.\n  Mr. President, you can't judge a book by its cover. The language \nbeing used here is that this is a package of deficit reduction. But \nthis is the first chapter. The first chapter reduces spending by $39 \nbillion. But the next chapter will reduce taxes by $70 billion. The \nthird chapter will increase the debt by $781 billion. You have to read \nthe whole book to know the conclusion. The conclusion of their book is \nmore deficits and more debt.\n  No one should believe this vote is about deficit reduction while \ninsisting on another $70 billion of tax cuts as part of this package. \nIn the second chapter of the book, the deficit actually goes up. The \nmajority's proposal to increase the debt limit by $781 billion, which \nis the third chapter of their book. With passage of this, the debt of \nthis country will have increased by $3 trillion during just this \nPresident's administration.\n  This package represents a continuation of the failed fiscal policies \nof this administration.\n  We can do better as a nation, and we can do much better--and we must.\n  This budget, if approved, will increase the debt of this country over \nthe next 5 years by another $3 trillion.\n  These policies are driving us deeper and deeper into debt to foreign \nnations.\n  In just the 4 years or 5 years of this administration, we have seen \nthe debt of the country multiplied by $3 trillion.\n  I urge my colleagues to say no. Let us not continue any further down \nthis course of deficits and debt.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking all my colleagues \nfor their very constructive efforts today. The fact that we were able \nto complete the voting process today was a reflection of the \nwillingness of people in this Chamber, especially the staff who acted \nin an extraordinarily professional way.\n  Also, of course, I want to thank Senator Conrad and his staff, Mary \nNaylor and her team.\n  Senator Conrad has been an incredibly positive, constructive, and \nprofessional individual to work with on this bill. This bill would not \nhave been completed--even though he may not agree with the bill, which \nhe doesn't, obviously, and he has argued his position--he has been more \nthan fair in allowing us to proceed through the bill. And it is a \nreflection of his extraordinary professionalism.\n  I thank everyone on the staff, except his chart maker.\n  (Laughter)\n  I also especially want to thank my staff--led by the inimitable Scott \nGudes--Gail Miller, Jim Hearn, Cheri Reidy, and the rest of the staff--\nDave Fisher and Denzel McGuire. We have had two staff members who have \nhad children just recently, Bill Lucia and Matt Howe. Matt's child was \nborn just as the debate started. I am sure he called him ``deficit \nreduction.'' We are all very excited about that. We very much \nappreciate the extraordinary job the staff has done here.\n  I think it is important for our membership to remember that this is \nthe first time in 8 years that this Congress has stepped forward to try \nto reduce spending by addressing the entitlement and mandatory accounts \nof our Government. This is a major step forward in the activity of \nfiscal responsibility.\n  The other side of the aisle has tried to join this bill with other \nbills. The simple fact is, the only vote you will cast--the only vote \nthat will be cast in the next few minutes--will be the only vote you \nare going to have to significantly reduce the deficit. It will be a \nveto to reduce the deficit by approximately $35 billion.\n  If you oppose the next bill that comes down the pike--the tax relief \nbill--that is your choice. But that is not what you are voting on here. \nWhat you are voting on here is the opportunity to reduce the deficit, \nand it is the only opportunity you are going to have, and it is the \nfirst time, as I mentioned, in 8 years that we will be proceeding down \nthis road. It is a step toward fiscal responsibility, and it is a \nreflection of the Republican Congress's commitment to pursue a path of \nfiscal responsibility.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it has been a long day. The next vote on \nfinal passage will be our last vote of the day. This will be our 22nd \nrollcall vote of the day.\n  I thank the chairman and the ranking member for a tremendous job. \nAbout 4 or 5 days ago, we said it was going to be done by 6 o'clock. We \nwere going to complete this bill. Indeed, they have accomplished just \nthat.\n  We will be in session tomorrow, but there will be no rollcall votes. \nWe will go to the DOD authorization bill. Again, there will be no \nrollcall votes tomorrow. We will be on the DOD authorization bill on \nFriday and Monday.\n  We will have rollcall votes Monday night. We will not be voting \nbefore 5:30 on Monday.\n  With that, congratulations. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I and some of my colleagues, in a \nbipartisan effort, introduced the Integrity in Professional Sports Act. \nI especially thank my colleague from Arizona, Senator John McCain, for \nworking with me on this important legislation. I thank the chairman of \nthe Commerce Committee, Senator Stevens, and Senators Grassley and \nRockefeller, for cosponsoring our bill.\n  This is certainly not a bill any of us wanted to introduce. We wish \nCongress did not have to get involved in the issue of drug abuse in \nprofessional sports. Unfortunately, this might be the only way to get \nprofessional sports to finally clean up its act.\n  As a former major league baseball player and member of its Hall of \nFame, protecting the integrity of our national pastime is a matter near \nand dear to my heart. I know it is near and dear to the hearts of so \nmany across America. We have heard a lot of talk over the last year \nabout the leagues working to implement new, tougher drug-testing \nstandards. So far, that is all it has been, a lot of talk. Major League \nBaseball and its baseball union told us over a month ago they hoped to \nhave a new agreement in place by the end of the World Series. The World \nSeries is over and there is still no agreement. The time for talking is \nover. The leagues have had their chance and have failed to lead. Now we \nare going to do it for them.\n  We are, in a way, obligated to act since they cannot. We must not \nonly ensure that our Federal drug laws are not being circumvented, but \nwe also need to restore some integrity to the games that tens of \nmillions of Americans enjoy so much. We must act for the sake of our \nchildren who see these players as heroes and want to emulate them. Like \nit or not, professional athletes are role models. They need to set a \nbetter example to kids who see them smashing home runs or sacking the \nquarterback and want to be like them. Unfortunately, too many \nprofessional athletes are injecting themselves and popping pills with \nfalse hopes and dangerous health effects. Now these acts are being \nemulated by kids even in high school because of the pressure they feel \nto perform at such a young age. We have a duty to help bring this to an \nend.\n  As Members of Congress, we can play an important role in educating \nthe public on the terrible health effects from steroids. Illegal \nperformance-enhancing drugs are a serious problem in professional \nsports and they need to stop now. I hope my colleagues will continue to \njoin us in this bipartisan cause. I look forward to working with both \nsides of the aisle on moving this bill forward swiftly.\n  I yield to my colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am very proud to join Senator Bunning, \nwho many know is a Major League Baseball Hall of Famer. Not many know \nhe was a founding member of Major League Baseball's Players Union. He \nbrings to this issue impeccable credentials and an enormous amount of \npassion. I am pleased to be supportive of his leadership in this \neffort.\n  It is my hope this legislation would not be necessary. Senator \nBunning and I both come to this legislation with great reluctance. But \nas Senator Bunning pointed out, the Major League Baseball players said \nthey would, by the World Series, come up with an agreement. That has \nnot happened.\n  The legislation is an effort to set minimum standards that have \nproven effective in Olympic sports and would also introduce \nindependence--and this is crucial--into the drug testing programs of \nprofessional leagues.\n  Without an independent entity, such as the U.S. Anti-doping Agency \nthat establishes and manages a testing and adjudication program, the \nfox will continue to guard the henhouse. That is exactly the problem \nthat the U.S. Olympic movement faced several years ago, and they \nbrought integrity back to American Olympic sports by putting the \nresponsibility for testing in the hands of an independent entity.\n  There are some who argue that Senator Bunning and I have no business \nlegislating an issue which is basically a labor-management issue. We \nagree. We agree. We do not want to have to legislate. We do not want to \nhave to force both entities to do something they otherwise should have \ndone, but we have no choice. As the Senator from Kentucky has so \neloquently pointed out, our obligation is not to the people who are \nmaking millions of dollars this year. Our obligation is not even to \nthose who are members of professional sports. Our obligations are to \nthe families of the young people who believe the only way they can make \nit in the major leagues is to inject these substances into their \nbodies.\n  Anybody who followed the hearing on the House side, where there was \ntestimony from parents of young men who had committed suicide as a \nresult of the use of these substances, knows this issue has now \ntranscended a labor-management issue. Senator Bunning and I come to \nthis floor more in sorrow than in anger that we have had to take this \nextraordinary step. But we will take it; we will take it for the \nbenefit of young Americans who believe the only way they can make it in \nthe major leagues is by using these substances and to give hope to \nothers who refuse to do it and want to make it on their own merits.\n  Mr. President, I again thank the Senator from Kentucky, who has been \na role model to so many millions of young Americans for so many years, \nfor his involvement in this effort.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, might I speak for a moment?\n  Mr. President, I wish to say, before Senator McCain and Senator \nBunning leave the floor, I think my colleagues know I must recuse \nmyself from all matters on baseball because my wife represents Major \nLeague Baseball. But as a personal matter, I wish to thank Senator \nMcCain and Senator Bunning for their moral leadership. It is a\n\n[[Page S12346]]\n\nscourge not only for professional sports but for amateur sports \nbecause, increasingly, those who are competing on an amateur level \nbelieve they have to use steroids to compete. That is a tragedy.\n  We are seeing usage of steroids at 20 to 40 percent in high school \nathletes because they read the stories, and they see what others are \ndoing who have been at the very highest levels.\n  So I wish to give my profound thanks to Senator McCain and Senator \nBunning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it has been a long day in the Senate, \nespecially for our capable and dedicated staff. I wish to take a couple \nof minutes to say thank you to the Senators who, a bit ago, supported \nthe Snowe-Wyden legislation to hold down the cost of prescription \nmedicine.\n  Tonight a majority of the Senate voted to make the Federal Government \na smart shopper when it comes to prescription drugs. For the first \ntime, the Senate voted to remove an error of commission: the \nauthorization of a provision in the prescription drug law that bars the \nFederal Government from negotiating to hold down the cost of \nprescription drugs.\n  For the life of me, at a time when the Federal budget is \nhemorrhaging, when the Government must pay for the costs of Katrina, I \ndo not see how you can argue against the Snowe-Wyden amendment that was \noffered tonight. It prohibits price controls--that is certainly \ncritical--so we can encourage innovation and research in the \npharmaceutical area, but what the Snowe-Wyden amendment does is ensure \nthat the Federal Government is going to do what everybody does in the \nmarketplace--and that is use its bargaining power to hold down the \ncosts. That is what the Federal Emergency Management Agency does when \nit buys cots, what every Federal agency does to make sure taxpayers and \nour citizens have their concerns addressed responsibly.\n  Now, tonight, Senator Snowe and I had to get a supermajority to \nprevail. I want it understood that no matter how many procedural \nhurdles are put in front of us, no matter how many roadblocks are put \nup, we are going to keep coming back on this issue again and again and \nagain until the needs of seniors and our taxpayers are met.\n\n  The older people of this country are insisting that an offensive \npiece of special interest legislation, one that defies common sense, \nget changed. The AARP made the case when they backed our bipartisan \nbill. They pointed out that drugs seniors use, such as Lipitor, are \ngoing up more than twice the rate of inflation. Seniors want that \nchanged. They will not abide it. Taxpayers will not abide it. And \nSenator Snowe and I are going to stay at it until Medicare is liberated \nand can act as a smart shopper.\n  Fifty-one Senators--a majority of this body--said tonight it is time \nto get serious about holding down the cost of medicine in the United \nStates. Fifty-one votes is not the supermajority we needed, but Senator \nSnowe and I are going to stay at it until we get justice done for our \nolder people.\n  Finally, I want to say a special thanks to our bipartisan group of \nsponsors and particularly thank Senator Stabenow, Senator McCain, and \nSenator Feinstein. They are all Senators who got this from the get-go. \nThey understood this was a question of making sure that, at a time when \nthe Federal Government begins the biggest expansion of entitlement \nhealth care in years, we take steps to protect the interests of \ntaxpayers and the interests of older people who, right now, are \nbeginning to sign up for the program and will, in fact, start \nparticipating formally next year.\n  We believed it was important tonight to offer this amendment. We wish \nwe had more time to discuss it this evening. I went into it at some \nlength yesterday, but I am pleased we made real progress. For the first \ntime, a majority of the Senate says that this provision that keeps the \nFederal Government from being a smart shopper simply does not add up. \nIt does not make sense. It defies logic. It is contrary to what \neverybody else does in the marketplace across the country. I wish we \ncould have gotten the 60 votes needed to prevail tonight, but for the \nfirst time we got a majority, and we are going to come back again and \nagain and again. We are going to do it because the older people of this \ncountry deserve a fair shake. They are going to insist we keep coming \nback.\n  I close my comments tonight by thanking the Presiding Officer, as \nwell, for his support in this effort.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I was saddened to learn today that James \nGray passed away after a long illness on November 1, 2005. Mr. Gray was \n78 years old and lived in Danville, CA. I knew him as the founder of \nthe National Writing Project, which today is credited with perfecting \nthe training model of teachers teaching teachers how to teach writing.\n  For more than 30 years, teachers of all grades and nearly the entire \nspectrum of subject areas have benefitted from the vision and \ndedication of Jim Gray to finding better ways of raising a new \ngeneration of writers. Thousands of teachers have participated every \nyear in workshops, classes and retreats to perfect their skills, and as \na result, an exponential tens of thousands of students continue taking \nnew steps to becoming skillful writers.\n  It was his work that gave me the good fortune of meeting him, and my \nbecoming a close friend to the Writing Project as the sponsor of \nlegislation to make it a Federal program under the U.S. Department of \nEducation.\n  Across the country, many teachers and students mourn him, but I hope \nthey take his serious creativity in teaching and live his legacy of the \nNational Writing Project. I extend to his family, and to all who knew \nhim, my message of gratitude for his life's work and my deep sympathy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the obituary of James Gray \nreleased today by the National Writing Project be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         National Writing Project Founder James Gray Dead at 78\n\n       James Gray, founder of the National Writing Project, died \n     November 1 in Danville, California, after a long illness.\n       Gray, a former high school teacher and then a senior \n     lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley's Graduate \n     School of Education, founded the innovative Bay Area Writing \n     Project in 1974. Acting on his belief that successful \n     classroom teachers were an untapped resource for providing \n     their peers with professional development, Gray brought \n     together 25 talented Bay Area teachers and charged them with \n     sharing their expertise about the teaching of writing.\n       The Bay Area Writing Project became the first site that \n     offered a professional development model for teachers of \n     writing. Now known as the National Writing Project (NWP), the \n     program has grown to 189 university-based sites located in \n     fifty states, Washington, DC, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. \n     Virgin Islands.\n       Gray served as Executive Director of the NWP until his \n     retirement in 1994 and remained on the NWP Board of Directors \n     until his death.\n       Gray's simple but highly successful model has been \n     responsible for transforming classroom practices and \n     improving student writing performance at schools in rural, \n     urban, and suburban communities across the U.S.\n       ``Jim's belief in teachers and their knowledge, commitment, \n     and creativity never wavered,'' said NWP Executive Director \n     Richard Sterling. ``We are all the beneficiaries of his \n     vision and his tireless work on behalf of the National \n     Writing Project.''\n       For more information about Jim Gray and the National \n     Writing Project, visit the NWP website at \n     www.writingproject.org.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/03/senate-section/article/S12346-3", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12346-S12348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                LAUNCHING OF JEWISH SOCIAL ACTION MONTH\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to announce the launching\n\n[[Page S12347]]\n\nof the first Jewish Social Action Month--a month where Jews around the \nworld will be encouraged to engage in good works and service to their \ncommunities.\n  I am joined in this effort by my colleague in the House, Congressman \nSteve Israel of New York, as well as members of the Israeli Knesset.\n  Throughout the month--and every year in the second month of the \nHebrew calendar, Heshvan, from here on out--Jews from across the globe \nwill be encouraged to perform acts of loving kindness to their \nneighbors, regardless of faith.\n  The concept of Social Action can be interpreted broadly and there are \nendless possibilities for action.\n  The Israeli Friends of the Earth, for example, will be launching \ninitiatives to clear up the debris which ruins our countryside.\n  In Boston, Jewish students are working to help students in inner city \nschools develop their reading and writing skills.\n  In New York, Jewish groups are delivering Thanksgiving meals to the \nelderly who are housebound.\n  These are just three quick examples of the kinds of service we hope \npeople will be inspired to undertake in November and continue year \nround--inspiring people of all faiths to join in service to their \nneighbors as well.\n  The idea for Jewish Social Action Month came from two young men--\nJosef Abramowitz of Boston and Aryeah Green of Israel--during a retreat \nin the Israeli desert.\n  They wanted a way to motivate people of all ages to realize the words \nof The Scriptures that tells us to help those who have the least among \nus. For instance, in Deuteronomy we are told to love a poor stranger \nand give him food and clothing because we too were strangers in Egypt \nand God fed and clothed us.\n  The President of Israel, Moshe Katsav, has been an enthusiastic \nsupporter of Jewish Social Action Month and is lending the prestige of \nhis office in Israel to urge that people heed this call to community \nservice.\n  I want to thank all of those individuals, groups, synagogue and \ntemple leadership and membership who are joining this effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na number of statements and articles relating to Jewish Social Action \nMonth.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Declaration Regarding Chodesh Chesed Vetzedek, the Social Action Month\n\n       It has been taught to you O man what is good and what the \n     Lord requires of you, only to do justice and loving kindness \n     and to walk humbly with your G-d (Micah VI:8).\n       At the foundation of our faith lies the importance of acts \n     of loving kindness. Through its narratives and the laws of \n     the Torah, God calls on us to make our world a holier, more \n     just and caring place.\n       At Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur we think about our \n     responsibilities to God, and everyone around us including the \n     needy of the world who depend on our support. We promise to \n     do more for them in the coming year. Just a few days later, \n     we celebrate Succot. This festival recalls Biblical times \n     when the Jewish people lived in temporary shelters as they \n     journeyed through the desert. It also reminds us that in our \n     own times there are people across the world in need of food, \n     shelter, warmth and love.\n       As Succot ends, we enter the month of Cheshvan, the month \n     that has no festivals, a time dedicated to putting into \n     practice our pledges to be better people and to better the \n     lives of those around us.\n       The Government of Israel, through its Ministry for Israeli \n     Society and the World Jewish Community has invited \n     communities in Israel and across the globe to proclaim this \n     Cheshvan a month of Chesed and Tzedek (loving kindness and \n     social justice). Everywhere, Jewish organisations will be \n     launching Chesed and Social action programmes.\n       We are delighted to add our voices to this call which \n     echoes the voice of our tradition. We invite our communities \n     to seek ways to help and support those in need wherever they \n     are, so that through our acts of loving kindness, we may \n     indeed ``mend the world according to the Kingship of God''.\n       May our efforts bring peace and blessing upon our \n     communities, the whole House of Israel and the whole world.\n       Rabbi Menachem HaCohen--Chief Rabbi of Romania, Rabbi \n     Warren Goldstein--Chief Rabbi of South Africa, and Sir \n     Jonathan Sacks--Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom.\n                                  ____\n\n         Office of the Prime Minister, Ministry for Israeli \n           Society & the World Jewish Community,\n                                      Jerusalem, November 3, 2005.\n       I am delighted to send my greetings to this distinguished \n     gathering at the Congress in Washington to launch the first \n     ever Jewish Social Action Month. I would like to thank \n     everyone who has come today and in particular my dear friend \n     Senator Joe Lieberman and Congressman Steve Israel who are \n     hosting this event. My thanks also Yossi Abramovitch, Rebecca \n     Lieberman and all the members of Kol Dor who have worked so \n     hard to make it such a success.\n       At the heart of the Jewish religion lies the importance of \n     caring for others. According to the rabbis, God made all of \n     humanity in his image in order to show that all people of all \n     faiths, colors and creeds are important to the Almighty. We \n     are taught in the Jerusalem Talmud that there is no limit to \n     the amount of loving kindness we should do or to the Divine \n     reward we receive for these actions.\n       It is therefore gives me great pride as Deputy Minister for \n     Israeli Society and the World Jewish Community in the \n     Government of Israel together with the Kol Dor Organization \n     to launch the very first ever Jewish Social Action month \n     whereby Jews from all over the world and from every \n     background will take part in different activities to mend the \n     world and make it a better place for us all.\n       I wish everyone here much success in their activities and I \n     thank you all once again for your support for this important \n     project.\n     Rabbi Michael Melchior,\n       Deputy Minister responsible for Israeli Society and the \n     World Jewish Community.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Testimony of Yosef I. Abramowitz in Support of Declaring the Hebrew \n           Month of Heshvan Global Jewish Social Action Month\n\n       Chairwoman Collette Avital, other Members of Knesset, Kol \n     Dor conference chair Yael Andoran, fellow Kol Dor Members, \n     friends and others who care about the future of the Jewish \n     people and Jewish mission.\n       It is a great privilege to introduce a global Jewish idea \n     to this important body, an idea that can: help unite Jews \n     around the world; strengthen the global integrity of the \n     Jewish people; highlight positive Jewish values; and, of \n     course, catalyze the performance of hopefully countless acts \n     of hesed and tzedek, of social action and social justice.\n       We at Kol Dor recognize that there are multiple points of \n     entry into Jewish peoplehood, especially for the under-\n     affiliated of the next generation who are not joining through \n     traditionally prescribed ways. The prophetic call to repair \n     the world, which resonates clearly in Israel's Declaration of \n     Independence, clearly speaks to young Jews around the world, \n     across the religious and political spectrum. We seek to \n     harness this idealism, unfortunately often cast in a \n     universal rather than particularly Jewish frame. We seek to \n     join a strong social justice stream found in Jewish \n     teachings--as Rav Gideon Sylvester just demonstrated--with \n     the growing tide of alienated young Jews, and create a \n     powerful current of Peoplehood with Purpose.\n       The idea is quite simple: The Jewish people, who have \n     contributed so much to the moral advancement of civilization, \n     will focus our energies and attention on the month of Heshvan \n     and transforming it internationally into Jewish Social Action \n     Month. Following the Yamim Noraim, when world Jewry is \n     mobilized to celebrate the High Holy Days, Jews will be \n     invited to express our people's universal hopes for humanity \n     and civilization by actions--local, national, international--\n     that express our values of aryevut, and tzedek.\n       The idea is to open-source this idea in all Jewish \n     communities, from Hodu and Kush, from Metula to Eilat, from \n     San Francisco to San Paulo, from Sydney to London, and \n     everywhere in between.\n       As Jews, we know the power of symbols. In an era of Jewish \n     history when we live with so many internal divisions, our \n     communities want to rally around positive ideas and actions \n     that unite Jews worldwide.\n       We seek neither to dictate nor control, but to provide \n     leadership. We seek to link powerful ideas with personal \n     example, doogma Isheet, and to seed the great imagination and \n     intellectual power of Jews worldwide, as they seek ways to \n     make a difference in the world.\n       We, Kol Dor members from sixteen countries, respectfully \n     offer this committee and the Knesset the opportunity to \n     provide not just leadership to Medinat Yisrael, but to Am \n     Yisrael.\n       Thank you for your positive consideration of declaring \n     Heshvan Global Jewish Social Action Month.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Rabbi Michael Melchior Op Ed Piece for the JTA for the Jewish Social \n                              Action Month\n\n       As the member of the Government of Israel with \n     responsibility for the world Jewish community, I have the \n     privilege of meeting Jews of all types, from all over the \n     world. There are huge cultural, historical and theological \n     variations amongst Jews and these lend color and variety to \n     our people. But the differences also create problems. The \n     deep rifts that occurred in Israel over the issue of \n     disengagement and the battles between different groups \n     demonstrated once again the profound divisions amongst us. \n     The Jewish people stand in danger of splitting into different \n     factions with different narratives. Amidst so much diversity, \n     what can unite us?\n\n[[Page S12348]]\n\n       Wherever I travel in the Jewish world, I am struck by the \n     way that Jewish people of all types are determined to make a \n     Kiddush Hashem (sanctification of God's name) and to avoid a \n     Hillul Hashem (desecration of God's name). The concept of the \n     Kiddush Hashem originates in the Biblical command ``I shall \n     be sanctified amongst the people of Israel''. One \n     interpretation of this verse is that Jews should display \n     total dedication to their faith and even be willing to lay \n     down their lives for it. This belief motivated millions of \n     Jewish martyrs throughout our history to give up their lives \n     rather than abandon their Judaism. Today, it is rare for Jews \n     to be faced with such a stark choice between their faith and \n     their lives, but Kiddush Hashem offers another powerful \n     challenge which has particular resonance in our times. Each \n     one of us has to ensure that the word ``Jewish'' is always \n     associated with the highest levels of ethics and kindness, so \n     that our behavior always brings credit to our heritage and to \n     our God.\n       On a daily basis, we witness the disgrace that is attached \n     to religion when it is linked with the horrors of priests \n     engaging in child abuse and the fanaticism of ``religious'' \n     suicide bombers. Tragically, throughout our long history, our \n     own faith has also spawned instances of the desecration of \n     God's name. The rabbis recognized these and declared that it \n     was our failure to show care, compassion, decency and loving \n     kindness to one another that caused so many of our sorrows \n     including the destruction of the Temple. In our own times, \n     the most famous desecration of God's name was the massacre of \n     Arabs at prayer in the mosque in Hebron and the murder of the \n     Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. It was these outrages \n     that drove me to put to aside my work as a Chief Rabbi of \n     Norway and to enter Israeli politics. I felt that it was \n     crucial for the government of Israel to work on a grand scale \n     to restore the image of Judaism from one of intolerance and \n     fanaticism to one of ethics, tolerance and compassion. It was \n     my duty as a rabbi to play my part in that campaign. This is \n     a crucial message of Judaism. Holiness is not the exclusive \n     possession of those who engage in detailed ritual observance \n     nor is it the preserve of those who devote their energies to \n     the pursuit of spirituality; true holiness is found in the \n     small actions that make a profound difference to the lives of \n     the people around us and the world they live in.\n       This is why I am so delighted that in partnership with the \n     Koldor organization, my office is launching the Jewish Social \n     Action Month this Cheshvan (November). It falls one month \n     after Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur so it is a time to draw on \n     all of the resolutions that we made over the High Holidays. \n     It's also a month with no festivals in it which enables us to \n     dedicate time to Social Action activities.\n       Throughout the month Jews from across the globe will be \n     performing acts of loving kindness to their neighbors both \n     Jewish and Gentile. The concept of social action can be \n     interpreted broadly and there are endless possibilities for \n     action. The Israeli Friends of the Earth, for example, will \n     be launching initiatives to clear up the debris which ruins \n     our countryside, the Israeli Police Force will be engaging in \n     projects to show care and concern in the community, one youth \n     movement will be organizing a sports event for the \n     underprivileged, another arranging a national blood donation \n     drive. It is beautiful to see how in Israel, and spreading \n     across South America, North America, Russia, and Europe, Jews \n     ranging from Chief Rabbis to the most secular of our people \n     will be engaged in the Social Action Month.\n       I very much hope that you will feel moved to join in the \n     project; to make a Kiddush Hashem and turn our world into a \n     better place. I look forward to hearing about your activities \n     and reading about them on the website of the Prime minister \n     of Israel.\n                                  ____\n\n\n     Check the Calendar--Cheshvan is now Jewish Social Action Month\n\n                             (By Tzvi Kahn)\n\n       New York, June 30.--Aryeh Green and Yosef Abramowitz were \n     sipping tea in a Bedouin tent last year in Sde Boker, a \n     kibbutz in Israel's Negev desert, when they had an idea.\n       Participants at a conference of Kol Dor, an organization \n     that seeks to revitalize Jewish activism and unity across the \n     globe, the two were discussing how the group could promote \n     Jewish identity and peoplehood.\n       ``Most Jewish institutions and endeavors are out of touch \n     with the next generation of Jews because of a lack of \n     relevance,'' Abramowitz, CEO of Jewish Family and Life, which \n     publishes several Jewish Web sites and magazines, told JTA. \n     ``But we do know that the idealism and the desire to \n     contribute to the world'' are predominant.\n       It occurred to them that a month in the Jewish calendar \n     formally dedicated to social action would be an ideal means \n     of mobilizing and inspiring the Jewish community.\n       Their initiative received a major boost this week when the \n     Knesset's Committee on Immigration, Absorption and Diaspora \n     Affairs proclaimed the Jewish month of Cheshvan, which falls \n     in November this year, as Social Action Month.\n       According to Green, who serves as an adviser to former \n     Israeli Cabinet minister Natan Sharansky, ``We agreed that if \n     we wanted Kol Dor to succeed, we would have to focus on \n     practical, tangible contributions.''\n       ``What makes this initiative interesting and unique is that \n     it harnesses the power of different social action and Jewish \n     organizations to get involved,'' Green said. The goal is not \n     to spearhead specific projects, but to ``pull together the \n     existing frameworks of social action.''\n       The effort has garnered the support of various Jewish \n     groups, including the Jewish Agency for Israel and Hillel: \n     The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life, the Israel Defense \n     Forces' education branch and the World Union of Jewish \n     Students.\n       Abramowitz said Labor Party legislator Colette Avital, who \n     chairs the Knesset's immigration committee, has sent a letter \n     to various Jewish organizations expressing support.\n       Jewish schools in Israel and the Diaspora will be a \n     particular focus of the initiative. According to Abramowitz, \n     Social Action Month will receive special attention in the \n     BabagaNewz, a monthly magazine on Jewish values that JFL \n     publishes for elementary school students. The magazine serves \n     1,400 Jewish schools and has a circulation of more than \n     40,000.\n       The JFL journal Sh'ma and magazine JVibe also intend to \n     publish features on the subject, he said.\n       Abramowitz said Cheshvan was selected for the project \n     because it immediately follows the High Holidays, which \n     usually spur higher levels of Jewish observance.\n       The Knesset decision also represents a victory for Kol Dor, \n     whose philosophy formed the ideological foundation for Social \n     Action Month.\n       ``The paradigm that we are advocating in Jewish life is \n     that peoplehood is a central mobilizing force,'' Abramowitz \n     said, citing the success of the movement to rescue Soviet \n     Jewry as one example.\n       The group seeks to use the Jewish concept of tikkun olam, \n     or repairing the world, as a unifying theme.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/03/senate-section/article/S12348-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING MRS. ROSA PARKS\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. This week we have honored the memory of Rosa Parks, a \nwoman whose quiet stand for her individual rights reverberated across \nthis country.\n  We often discuss how far we have to go as a country in terms of race \nrelations. Thinking of Rosa Parks reminds me how far we have come. In \n1955 when she refused to give up her seat on the bus in Montgomery, \nAfrican Americans in the South could not eat in the same restaurants, \ngo to the same colleges, sleep in the same motels, be cared for in the \nsame hospitals or compete on the same sports teams as other Americans.\n  Rosa Parks' actions that day in Montgomery helped spark a movement \nthat changed our country forever for the better. Condoleezza Rice, one \nof the bright minds leading our country today, rightly noted at the \nmemorial service in Alabama, ``. . . that without Mrs. Parks, I would \nnot be standing here today as Secretary of State.''\n  Rosa Parks and those who took up the call inspired me, too. As editor \nof the student paper at Vanderbilt University, I wrote editorials \nurging desegregation of that school in 1962.\n  We made great progress in those days, as we continue to do today. Our \nNation has always been a work in progress, ever since our Founders \nsigned the Declaration of Independence declaring that ``all men are \ncreated equal.'' We're still working to achieve that noble goal of \nrecognizing our equality. But thanks to Americans like Rosa Parks, \nwe've come a long way.\n  Rosa Parks' courage has earned for her a noble place in the history \nof our Nation's struggle for equal opportunity. We will miss her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/03/senate-section/article/S12348-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12348-S12349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On October 1, 2003, just east of West Hollywood, a gay man was \nattacked in his home with a bat by a pair of assailants.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the dedicated team \nof scientists, engineers, and innovators of NASA's Glenn Research \nCenter in Cleveland for their hard work and perseverance. I have \nrecognized in previous years the award-winning work of researchers and \nengineers at NASA Glenn and am proud to do so again today.\n  The Glenn Research Center has come up with a wide range of products \nthat not only contribute to further progress in our space exploration \nmission, but also provide for remarkable enhancements in the quality of \nlife of citizens throughout the United States. Through NASA's \ncommercialization initiatives, these products have enabled the creation \nof new jobs in the country, thereby encouraging additional economic \ngrowth nationwide.\n  This year, four products introduced by NASA Glenn have been \ndistinguished among the ``Top 100 Most Technologically Significant \nProducts of the Year.'' They have been recognized by the editors of \nResearch & Design Magazine and awarded four of the ``R 100'' awards--\nawards known by many as the ``Oscars of Invention.'' Their remarkable \nachievements clearly illustrate the high level of professionalism that \ndistinguishes the Glenn Research Center, its employees, and the \nnumerous organizations and individuals who work in partnership with the \nCenter.\n  It is with great pride that I recognize each of the award \nparticipants and congratulate them for their outstanding work. In \ndeveloping an award-winning family of rod-coil block copolymers, Dr. \nMary Ann Meador and Dr. James Kinder of Glenn's Materials Division have \nimproved ionic conductivity in lithium polymer batteries. These new \npolymers will enable cost-saving advances in battery technologies, \nresulting in improvements to products ranging from mobile phones to \nfuel cells. Through this important innovation, it will be possible to \noffer lower manufacturing costs, while increasing battery safety to \nmeet future aerospace application requirements.\n  The NASA Glenn Sensors and Electronics Branch team has been \nrecognized for its development of a new sensor-based fire detection \nsystem that effectively recognizes the presence of fire while screening \nout false alarms. Dr. Gary Hunter led the development effort in \ncollaboration with colleagues from Case Western Reserve University, the \nOhio State University, Makel Engineering, and the Federal Aviation \nAdministration. This revolutionary device will improve fire alarms in \ncargo and baggage compartments of commercial aircraft and is also \nspecifically adapted to fit the requirements of the International Space \nStation.\n  The Center also has received recognition for its work on a material \nknown as the Glenn Refractory Adhesive for Bonding and Exterior Repair, \nGRABER. This material, which was considered for use in the Space \nShuttle Return to Flight program, was developed and tested by Dr. \nMrityunjay ``Jay'' Singh, now a four-time ``R 100'' award winner, and \nTarah Shpargel of NASA Glenn's Ceramics Branch. This dynamic material \nwill allow in-space repair of both large and small cracks in the space \nshuttle thermal protection system--a capability that is absolutely \nessential for the safety and success of future Space Shuttle missions \nfollowing the tragic loss of the Columbia. In addition to its \napplications in space, GRABER has a number of potential industrial \napplications due to its low cost and excellent adhesive properties.\n  Finally, NASA Glenn's Numerical Evaluation of Stochastic Structures \nUnder Stress, NESSUS, software program has been recognized as an award \nwinner this year. The NESSUS program combines state-of-the-art \nalgorithms with general-purpose numerical analysis methods to predict \nresponses in hi-tech systems, such as aerospace and automotive \nstructures, biomechanics, and gas turbine engines. Dr. Shantaram Pai, \nof Glenn's Structural Mechanics and Dynamics Branch, was responsible \nfor developing the probabilistic heat transfer module integrated in the \nsystem and managing the integration of nine other NASA-developed \nmodules into NESSUS, enabling analysis of a diverse range of problems.\n  I extend my most genuine congratulations to everyone who participated \nin each of NASA Glenn's award-winning projects.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/03/senate-section/article/S12349-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12349-S12350]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SUPERFUND LITIGATION\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the issue of \nclarifying Congress's intent regarding agricultural operations in \nrespect to Superfund litigation. I, along with my colleague from Idaho, \nSenator Craig, offered an amendment during the agriculture \nappropriations conference committee that would have done that very \nthing. The amendment passed the Senate, by a 9 to 8 vote, yet was \nstripped from the final conference report. Needless to say, I am \ndisappointed with this result. So much so, in fact, I decided not to \nsign the conference report.\n  When the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and \nLiability Act, or CERCLA, was passed in 1980 and the Emergency Planning \nand Community Right-To-Know Act, or EPCLA, was passed in 1986, \nagriculture was never part of the deal. These acts were intended to \nprovide for clean up of toxic waste dumps and spills such as Love Canal \nand Times Beach. To this end, Congress created the Superfund to tax \nbuilding blocks, such as petrochemicals, inorganic raw materials and \npetroleum oil, used to make all hazardous products and waste. Animal \nagriculture waste, or manure, is clearly not among these materials. In \nfact, if you would have tried to attach agriculture to either of these \ntwo acts, they would not have passed. It was not Congress's intent to \napply Superfund rules to manure which contains naturally occurring \norganic compounds--such as orthophosphate, ammonia and hydrogen \nsulfide--which occur naturally in the environment in the same form as \nthey appear in manure.\n  Recently, municipal and State governments have filed suit against \nlivestock and poultry operations claiming Superfund liability in Texas \nand Oklahoma.\n  On April 24, 2004, the City of Waco, TX, filed suit in Federal court \nagainst eight dairies in the North Bosque River Watershed and later \namended the suit to include six additional dairies, seeking $45 million \nin damages under Superfund. The suit alleges that orthophosphate is \ndischarged from the dairies and has affected the water quality of Lake \nWaco which is located approximately 100 miles downstream from the \ndairies.\n  On June 13, 2005, the attorney general of the State of Oklahoma filed \nsuit in Federal court against 14 major integrated poultry production \nfirms claiming joint and several liability for damaged water quality in \nthe Illinois River Watershed caused by poultry litter runoff from \nagricultural lands to which it has been applied as fertilizer. The suit \nseeks to recover past, present, and future response costs under \nSuperfund, as well as natural resource damages that is expected to add \nup to several hundreds of millions of dollars. If these two cases are \nsuccessful, other municipalities and States could bring similar \nlawsuits and every animal feeding operation and farm could be held \nliable under Superfund.\n  This is another example of our judicial system overstepping its \nboundaries. Our judicial system is usurping the will of Congress and \ncreating laws Congress never meant to create.\n  Animal agriculture operations have been appropriately regulated and \nrequired to have permits for years under the Clean Water Act, the Clean \nAir Act, and various State laws to protect the environment, but never \nunder Superfund. My amendment would have left these laws in place. My \namendment would have only protected agricultural producers from another \nexample of an activist judicial system. Agriculture is already an over \nregulated industry and adding the possibility of Superfund litigation \nwill be too much to bear for farmers and ranchers.\n  Further, Superfund was created with a specific goal and mission in \nmind. The EPA is burdened to meet these goals as it is. To now add the \nmillions\n\n[[Page S12350]]\n\nof acres of agriculture as possible Superfund sites would be too heavy \na burden for the EPA to carry. Including agriculture within Superfund \ntakes away from Superfund's initial, worthy mission.\n  As I stated earlier, I am disappointed that the Superfund amendment \nwas stripped from this report after having passed the Senate. I fully \nintend to bring this item up next year and I am currently looking for \nways to move this legislation. This needs to happen for our farmers and \nranchers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/03/senate-section/article/S12350-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12350]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PROTECTING OUR HOMELAND SECURITY\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, despite the potential threat from \nterrorists armed with easily accessible powerful firearms, Congress \nstill has taken no action to require Federal registration of .50 \ncaliber sniper rifles. We must do more to protect our families and \ncommunities.\n  The .50 caliber sniper rifle is a favorite weapon of militaries \naround the world and is also among the most powerful weapons legally \navailable to private individuals in the United States. Published \nreports indicate that .50 caliber sniper rifles are capable of \naccurately hitting a target more than 1,500 yards away with a bullet \nmeasuring a half inch in diameter. In addition, these thumb-size \nbullets come in armor-piercing, incendiary, and explosive varieties \nthat can easily punch through aircraft fuselages, fuel tanks, and \nengines. Currently, these highly destructive sniper rifles, which have \nno sporting purpose, are subject to only minimal Federal regulation and \nare treated the same as other long rifles, including shotguns, hunting \nrifles, and smaller target rifles.\n  In August, the House of Delegates of the American Bar Association \nadopted a resolution in support of ``Federal, State, and territorial \nlaws that would restrict the sale, distribution, transfer, and \npossession of .50 caliber sniper weapons except to the U.S. military, \nand the National Guard and law enforcement agencies.'' The ABA report \nthat accompanied the resolution states:\n\n       Despite its destructive potential, the .50 caliber weapon \n     is sold like any other rifle. Under current law, one needs \n     only be 18 years of age, have a driver's license and pass a \n     minimal background check in order to buy the gun.\n       The U.S. Congress has acted to restrict various weapons \n     including specific firearms and ammunition. Rockets, mortars \n     and ammunition over .50 caliber size cannot be sold or \n     legally possessed by civilians. Machine guns, sawed-off \n     shotguns, imported junk handguns, silencers, guns made of \n     plastic or otherwise undetectable by metal screening devices \n     and some armor-piercing ammunition are currently banned or \n     restricted under federal law.\n\n  I am a cosponsor of the Fifty-Caliber Sniper Weapon Regulation Act \nintroduced by Senator Feinstein. This bill would reclassify .50 caliber \nrifles under the National Firearms Act, NFA, treating them the same as \nother high-powered or especially lethal firearms like several of those \nmentioned in the ABA's report. Among other things, reclassification of \n.50 caliber sniper rifles under the NFA would subject them to new \nregistration requirements. Future transfers or sales of .50 caliber \nsniper rifles would have to be conducted through a licensed dealer with \nan accompanying background check. In addition, the rifle being sold \nwould have to be registered with Federal authorities.\n  We must take proactive steps to help prevent terrorists armed with \nmilitary style firearms purchased in the U.S. from carrying out attacks \non innocent Americans. I urge the Senate to take up and pass \ncommonsense gun safety legislation, like the Fifty-Caliber Sniper \nWeapon Regulation Act, to assist our law enforcement officials in \nprotecting our homeland security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/03/senate-section/article/S12350-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12350]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ARTHUR GIBB SR.\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this week my home State lost a \ndevoted public servant, an environmental pioneer, a good friend, and a \ngreat Vermonter: Art Gibb.\n  I first met Art when we served together in the Vermont Legislature \nwhere Art was known for his unassuming and gracious temperament. Art \nalso established a reputation as an insightful legislator with an \nunusual ability to forge consensus. These skills impressed me and, for \nover 30 years, I frequently sought Art's wisdom and advice when I found \nmyself confronted with difficult decisions both in Washington and \nMontpelier.\n  Though Art was remarkably accomplished as a member of the Vermont \nLegislature, he will undoubtedly be remembered for his work on the \nGovernor's Commission on Environmental Control through which he helped \nsave Vermont's beauty and natural resources from reckless \noverdevelopment.

Deane Davis appointed Art to lead the commission, \nwhich became known as the ``Gibb Commission,'' in 1969 as developers \nbegan exploiting lenient building regulations in an effort to turn a \nquick profit at the expense of public health and the environment. The \nGibb Commission traveled the State, held public hearings, and worked \ntirelessly to draft recommendations to address this pressing concern. \nThe result of the Gibb Commission's work was the bold and pioneering \nAct 250, legislation that has protected Vermont's waterways, forests, \nand natural landscape ever since.\n  Art's leadership of the Gibb Commission and his work during his two \ndecades in the legislature earned him well-deserved accolades. Still, \nArt never operated with any fanfare. Despite his newsworthy \naccomplishments, Art was never interested in seeing his name in the \nheadlines. His temperament and fair and nonpartisan nature won Art the \nrespect and admiration of colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Today, \nArt's portrait hangs in the State House, a rare honor and a fitting \ntribute for a man who left such an important mark on Vermont, both as a \nperson and a policymaker.\n  When Art retired from the Vermont Senate in 1986 I noted, on the \nfloor of the U.S. House of Representatives, ``I am more than certain, \nhowever, that all of us in Vermont will continue to benefit from his,--\nArt's--wit, his intelligence, his commitment, and his grace for many, \nmany years to come.'' This statement proved to be true, as Art remained \nan active member of the community and even served 12 years on the State \nEnvironmental Board after his retirement. Today, as we remember Art, I \ntake comfort in the certainty that generations of Vermonters will \ncontinue to benefit for years to come from Art's devotion to the \npreservation and conservation of our great State.\n  I extend my deepest condolences to Art's surviving children Barbara, \nDwight, Lowrie, Arthur, Jr. and Henry, as well as Art's ten \ngrandchildren and seven great grandchildren. All Vermonters mourn with \nyou knowing that without Art, Vermont would not be the beautiful and \nhealthy place it is today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/03/senate-section/article/S12350-3", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12350-S12351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING DR. BONNIE J. DUNBAR\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize \nthe extraordinary achievements of a gifted Washingtonian named Dr. \nBonnie J. Dunbar. Dr. Dunbar is widely acknowledged as one of the \nworld's most experienced female astronauts as well as a pioneer in \nbiomedicl engineering. In tribute to her accomplishments, Dr. Dunbar \nhas been selected to receive the distinguished Women in Engineering \nAchievement Award for 2005.\n  Born and raised on a ranch in Sunnyside, WA, Dr. Dunbar took an early \ninterest in space. As a child, she studied the exploits of astronauts \nlike Alan Shepherd and spent her nights studying the sky for signs of \npassing satellites. By the third grade, she had already declared that \nshe would one day be an astronaut. Encouraged by her parents to follow \nher dreams, Bonnie Dunbar attended the University of Washington where \nshe received her bachelor and master degrees in engineering, an \nimportant precursor to her career at NASA. However, her journey to \nspace was not without its hurdles.\n  Like a true pioneer, Dr. Dunbar worked to break down barriers. At a \ntime when women were generally discouraged from pursuing science based \ncareers, Dr. Dunbar both succeeded and prospered in her field, paving \nthe way for countless women who shared her interest in science. After \nreceiving her doctorate in Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering from \nthe University of Houston, Dr. Dunbar went on to\n\n[[Page S12351]]\n\nhold a number of esteemed research and engineering positions in the \nprivate sector. During this time, Dr. Dunbar assisted in the \ndevelopment and manufacture of Space Shuttle Thermal Protection Systems \nintegral to NASA flight operations.\n  In 1978, when NASA opened its astronaut program to women for the \nfirst time, Dr. Dunbar was one of the first candidates to enroll. \nAlthough she was not chosen in the final selection, NASA recognized her \ntalents and hired her as a payload officer and flight controller. This \nwould mark the beginning of a distinguished 27-year career at NASA. In \n1981, Dr. Dunbar earned her astronaut wings and was assigned to the \n1985 Challenger Spacelab mission. Following this successful mission, \nshe was selected to participate in four more missions in space. All \ntold, Dr. Dunbar logged more than 1,208 hours or 50 days in space.\n  Dr. Dunbar's exceptional performance during these missions garnered \nmore than six NASA Space Flight Medals, including the Superior \nAccomplishment Award in 1997, and the NASA Exceptional Achievement \nAward in 1996.\n  Doctor Bonnie Dunbar's meteoric rise from a small ranching community \nin the State of Washington to a veteran of five successful missions to \nspace is both extraordinary and inspiring. Her courageous trailblazing \ntook the world's fascination for space to new plateaus and encouraged \nwomen to follow their dreams. She truly is a remarkable pioneer and a \nworthy recipient of the distinguished Women in Engineering Achievement \nAward for 2005.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/03/senate-section/article/S12351-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CELEBRATING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF HULMAN-GEORGE FAMILY OWNERSHIP OF \n                    THE INDIANAPOLIS MOTOR SPEEDWAY\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to \nrecognize the important leadership of the Hulman-George family \nthroughout their 60 years of stewardship of the Indianapolis Motor \nSpeedway. I am honored to have this opportunity to congratulate them on \nreaching this signal milestone on November 14, 2005.\n  The Hulman-George family members have been remarkable champions of \nIndianapolis and the State of Indiana through their hosting of what \nmany consider to be the greatest spectacle in racing, the Indianapolis \n500. In recent years, they have also hosted the Brickyard 400 and the \nUnited States Grand Prix, remarkable events that bring people from \naround the world to Indianapolis to experience true Hoosier \nhospitality.\n  I have especially enjoyed a close relationship with the Hulman-George \nfamily, which began when I was Mayor of Indianapolis. My wife, Char, \nand I would take our four boys to the track for activities throughout \nthe month of May.\n  On May 16, 1981, I first had the opportunity to participate in \nanother great tradition at the Speedway when we gathered to celebrate \nthe annual Armed Forces Induction Ceremony. This event came about \nbecause recruitment was low and members of our community were looking \nfor a creative way to celebrate the decision of Hoosier men and women \nto serve our country in the Armed Forces. To address this dilemma, the \nHulman-George family offered the Indianapolis Motor Speedway as a \nbackdrop for an enlistment ceremony. Anyone who enlisted during the \nmonth of May would be a part of the Tony Hulman Squadron and would fly \naway from the infield to basic training. While the ceremony has evolved \nover the ensuing years, it remains special to me because it offers an \nexcellent opportunity to celebrate the patriotism of so many talented \nand dedicated young Hoosiers.\n  As race fans gather in Indianapolis to cheer their favorite drivers \non to victory, I am hopeful that they will take a moment to reflect \nupon the years of dedicated leadership that the Hulman-George family \nhas provided in the Indianapolis community, leadership that has helped \nto make Indianapolis the motorsports capitol of world.\n  Like so many of my fellow Hoosiers, I am grateful that the Hulman-\nGeorge family continues to call Indiana its home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/03/senate-section/article/S12351-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DANNY J.

Mr. President, I am very pleased to take a few \nmoments to recognize the many important accomplishments of Danny J. \nBakewell, Sr., as he prepares to step down as CEO of the Brotherhood \nCrusade.\n  Danny J. Bakewell, Sr. has spent the past 35 years building the \nBrotherhood Crusade into a nationally-recognized charitable \norganization in southern California. In that time, he has raised over \n$60 million to support a host of programs. Nurturing nonprofit groups \nand local small businesses is first and foremost among the Brotherhood \nCrusade's priorities. The venerable institution funds programs that \nprovide services for adults seeking job training and job placement, \nyoung people looking to realize their academic potential, and families \nseeking to improve their physical health.\n  The funding that Brotherhood Crusade provides is the lifeblood for \nmany organizations, making it possible for them to be the catalyst in \nbringing change to communities and change to individuals.\n  Danny's commitment to equality for all, fair representation in the \nmedia, and strengthening communities has been steadfast, as evidenced \nby his activist work. He was active in the struggle to bring a \npeaceable end to apartheid in South Africa. Danny galvanized a \ncoalition of community leaders to change the way entertainment \ncompanies represented slavery on prime time television. Along with his \nfamily, Danny launched a foundation to uplift the lives of children \nduring their treatments associated with leukemia and other life-\nthreatening diseases.\n  Danny Bakewell's success in the private sector have been important to \nunder-served communities throughout Los Angeles county as well. He is \nthe publisher of the Los Angeles Sentinel, the largest and oldest \nAfrican-American owned newspaper west of the Mississippi River. Danny \nwas the catalyst behind two development projects--the Compton Towne \nCenter and Compton Renaissance Plaza--which have helped to bring \neconomic vitality into an area that had been written off by many. In \naddition to creating much needed jobs for community residents and \nadditional tax revenues for the city, these projects are giving \nresidents a deeper sense of pride in their neighborhood.\n  I invite my colleagues to join me and the thousands of people touched \nby his work in commending Danny J. Bakewell, Sr. for his great \nleadership of the Brotherhood Crusade and tireless advocacy throughout \nhis lifetime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/03/senate-section/article/S12351-3", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12351-S12352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE DETROIT WINDSOR TUNNEL ON ITS 75TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \n75th anniversary of the Detroit Windsor Tunnel. Over the past 75 years, \nthe tunnel has been an indispensable link between the United States and \nCanada.\n  In the years before the construction of the tunnel, cars and trucks \ncrossed the Detroit River on ferries. During the winter, the river \nfroze and made the ferry ride between Detroit and Windsor dangerous. On \nNovember 3, 1930, President Herbert Hoover ushered in a new era in \nU.S.-Canadian relations when he officially opened the Detroit Windsor \nTunnel.\n  Not only has the tunnel been a vital commercial and cultural link \nbetween the United States and Canada, at the time of its construction \nit was an unparalleled engineering feat. The tunnel is approximately 1 \nmile long and reaches depths of 75 feet below the river. It is the only \nunderwater international vehicular border crossing in the world. At \nfull capacity, 2,400 vehicles can pass between Detroit and Windsor each \nhour through the tunnel.\n  During the tunnel's construction, there were as many as 600 workers \nsimultaneously building the structure. One group of workers called the \n``muckers'' dug a 32-foot hole in tight quarters through sand and clay \ndeep below the Detroit River. As a tribute to the workers who built the \nDetroit Windsor Tunnel a year ahead of schedule, the first person to \ndrive the distance of the tunnel and back was Joseph Zuccatto, a \nconstruction worker who earned 35 cents an hour.\n  The Detroit Windsor Tunnel is one of the cornerstones of the close \neconomic relationship between the United States\n\n[[Page S12352]]\n\nand Canada. The United States and Canada trade $1.2 billion worth of \ngoods and services each day that supports 5.2 million jobs. Trade \nbetween the United States and Canada is valued over $400 billion per \nyear. Michigan's trade with Canada represents 19 percent of the United \nStates land-based trade and supports 174,000 Michigan jobs.\n  The Detroit Windsor Tunnel is a crucial link between the U.S. and \nCanadian economies. The tunnel is one of the 15 busiest border \ncrossings nationally, with more than 9 million vehicles passing through \nthe tunnel each year. Additionally, at least 850 trucks and 5,000 \ncommuters pass through the tunnel for business, entertainment, and \nshopping each day.\n  In recent years, all U.S. ports of entry have balanced increased \nborder security requirements with the needs of tourists and business \ntravelers to quickly enter and leave the United States. The Detroit \nWindsor Tunnel has enthusiastically responded to these challenges and \nworked with local, State and Federal officials to meet these urgent \nneeds.\n  Mr. President, I commend the Detroit Windsor Tunnel on its 75th \nanniversary, for its service to the people of the United States and \nCanada, and for its continuous innovation to serve those who rely on \nit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/03/senate-section/article/S12352-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  At 9:20 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 2967.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \ncreate a new three-tiered approval system for drugs, biological \nproducts, and devices that is responsive to the needs of seriously ill \npatients, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1956\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Access, Compassion, Care, \n     and Ethics for Seriously Ill Patients Act'' or the ``ACCESS \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The necessity of placebo controlled studies has been \n     questioned on both scientific and ethical grounds for \n     seriously ill patients.\n       (2) The current standards of the Food and Drug \n     Administration for approval of drugs, biological products, \n     and devices deny the benefits of medical progress to \n     seriously ill patients who face morbidity or death from their \n     disease.\n       (3) Promising therapies intended to treat serious or life \n     threatening conditions or diseases and which address unmet \n     medical needs have received unjustified delays and denials of \n     approval.\n       (4) Seriously ill patients have a right to access available \n     investigational drugs, biological products, and devices.\n       (5) The current Food and Drug Administration and National \n     Cancer Institute case-by-case exception for compassionate \n     access must be required to permit all seriously ill patients \n     access to available experimental therapies as a treatment \n     option.\n       (6) The current emphasis on statistical analysis of \n     clinical information needs to be balanced by a greater \n     reliance on clinical evaluation of this information.\n       (7) Food and Drug Administration advisory committees should \n     have greater representation of medical clinicians who \n     represent the interests of seriously ill patients in early \n     access to promising investigational therapies.\n       (8) The use of available investigational products for \n     treatment is the responsibility of the physician and the \n     patient.\n       (9) The use of combinations of available investigational \n     and approved products for treatment is the responsibility of \n     the physician and the patient.\n       (10) The development and approval of drugs, biological \n     products, and devices intended to address serious or life-\n     threatening conditions or diseases is often delayed by the \n     inability of sponsors to obtain prompt meetings with the Food \n     and Drug Administration and to obtain prompt resolution of \n     scientific and regulatory issues related to the investigation \n     and review of new technologies.\n\n     SEC. 3. TIERED APPROVAL SYSTEM FOR DRUGS, BIOLOGICAL \n                   PRODUCTS, AND DEVICES.\n\n       Section 506 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 356) is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 506.

A bill to direct the Architect of the Capitol to obtain a \nstatue of Rosa Parks and to place the statue in the United States \nCapitol in National Statuary Hall; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, our Nation is mourning the recent loss of \nan icon in this country's civil rights movement and a true national \nhero, Ms. Rosa Parks. Today, along with Senators Obama, Levin, \nStabenow, Kennedy, Corzine and Smith, I am introducing legislation to \nhonor the memory of Rosa Parks by placing her statue in the United \nStates Capitol. This will help future generations understand her \nefforts to increase equality in the United States.\n  When I met Rosa Parks, I was overwhelmed by this graceful, small \nwoman's quiet strength and humility--her conviction in taking on the \narmy of power that was deployed before her--her courage to dig in, \nknowing full well the power of the courthouse, the power of the \nsheriff's badge, the power of the vigilante, the power of the \nestablishment--knowing that on dark country roads or after a knock on \nthe door in the middle of the night, people still disappeared and died \nalmost anonymous deaths. So many were killed just trying to be citizens \nin the land of the free.\n  Rosa Parks reminded many and taught even more how to speak the truth \nto power. In an era when these words are thrown around too easily, she \nlived the words `courage' and `patriot'--she loved the dream of our \ncountry more than herself, and she was willing to risk it all to live \nthe dream.\n  In the struggle for civil rights, some were called to stand up to \nBull Connor's fire hoses and police dogs--some to stand up to Klan \nterrorism--and some to stand up to state sponsored acts of violence. \nBut some were called simply to sit down--at lunch counters in \nGreensboro and Nashville and Atlanta--or on a bus in Montgomery.\n  Ms. Parks' dedication to civil rights has had an impact on the lives \nof all Americans. Her act of courage on December 1, 1955 inspired a \nmovement that eventually brought about laws to\n\n[[Page S12358]]\n\nend segregation, ensure voting rights, end discrimination in housing, \nand create a greater equality throughout this Nation. Thanks to Rosa \nParks, a path was forged for future generations to encourage freedom \nand social justice. Her legacy of courage and commitment plays an \nimportant role each time our Nation acts for equality and justice, and \nmost of all, in the hope for a better America.\n  If just one woman was able to do all this, then how much greater the \nresponsibility is for those of us with privilege and power who pay \ntribute to her today. The life of Rosa Parks demands deeds, not \nepitaphs. Our final words cannot be spoken or written while her cause \nis still unfinished. No simple words can match what she did in that \nsacred moment on a municipal bus in Montgomery, Alabama. What matters \nnow is what we do after the candles are quenched, the speeches have \nbeen exhausted, and the next bus comes by.\n  I am grateful for the opportunity to join my colleagues in this body, \nas well as those in the House of Representatives, to honor the legacy \nof this graceful, humble, and courageous woman who embodies the \nAmerican spirit. If this legislation is adopted, when our children and \nour grandchildren visit the United States Capitol, they will have the \nopportunity to learn more about the women who risked so much for their \nfreedom. Ms. Parks belongs among the other great leaders that have \nshaped this country and made the world a better place.\n  Sometimes the days seem heavy and the odds seem high, but that moment \non a bus in Montgomery always comes. Someone gets on that bus, refuses \nto equivocate or yield and changes history. Today, that someone must be \nus, for Rosa Parks and for our country.\n  The bus still comes by again and again and each time we have to \ndecide whether to go quietly to the back, or by simple acts of courage \nand conviction, change the direction of our own country's journey. A \nstatue of Rosa Parks in the Capitol can help future Senators and \nCongressmen find the courage necessary to make sure our Nation takes \nthe right course in the future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1959\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PLACEMENT OF STATUE OF ROSA PARKS IN NATIONAL \n                   STATUARY HALL.\n\n       (a) Obtaining Statue.--The Architect of the Capitol shall \n     enter into an agreement to obtain a statue of Rosa Parks, \n     under such terms and conditions as the Architect considers \n     appropriate and consistent with applicable law.\n       (b) Placement.--Not later than 2 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Architect shall place the statue \n     obtained under subsection (a) in the United States Capitol in \n     a suitable permanent location in National Statuary Hall.\n\n     SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be \n     necessary to carry out this Act, and any amounts so \n     appropriated shall remain available until expended.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/03/senate-section/article/S12358-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 298--DESIGNATING THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 2005, AS \n                       ``FEED AMERICA THURSDAY''\n\n  Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Bennett) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 298\n\n       Whereas Thanksgiving Day celebrates the spirit of selfless \n     giving and an appreciation for family and friends;\n       Whereas the spirit of Thanksgiving Day is a virtue upon \n     which our Nation was founded;\n       Whereas 33,000,000 Americans, including 13,000,000 \n     children, continue to live in households that do not have an \n     adequate supply of food;\n       Whereas almost 3,000,000 of those children experience \n     hunger; and\n       Whereas selfless sacrifice breeds a genuine spirit of \n     Thanksgiving, both affirming and restoring fundamental \n     principles in our society: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates Thursday, November 17, 2005, as ``Feed \n     America Thursday''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on the people of the United States to sacrifice 2 \n     meals on Thursday, November 17, 2005, and to donate the money \n     that they would have spent on food to a religious or \n     charitable organization of their choice for the purpose of \n     feeding the hungry.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to offer S. Res. 298, \ndesignating Thursday, November 17, 2005, as Feed America Thursday. I \nappreciate my friend, Senator Robert Bennett, joining with me in this \nresolution.\n  On Thanksgiving Day, we remember with deep gratitude the many \nbounties of life, including an appreciation for families and friends \nand the great country in which we live. Part of what makes this country \ngreat is the spirit of selfless giving and generosity of its citizens. \nThe great outpouring of support and assistance for the victims of \nHurricane Katrina is a most recent example.\n  In this season of Thanksgiving, it is important to also remember that \nover 33 million Americans, including 13 million children, continue to \nlive in households that do not have an adequate supply of food. These \nfellow citizens in need of food must not be forgotten.\n  On behalf of the Utah congressional delegation, Congressman Chris \nCannon has submitted a companion resolution in the House of \nRepresentatives. We urge our distinguished colleagues to join us in \ndesignating Thursday, November 17, 2005, as Feed America Thursday, to \nencourage our fellow citizens to sacrifice two meals on that day and \ndonate the money they would have spent on food to a religious or \ncharitable organization of their choice for the purpose of feeding the \nhungry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/03/senate-section/article/S12358-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 299--TO EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR THE GOALS OF NATIONAL \nADOPTION MONTH BY PROMOTING NATIONAL AWARENESS OF ADOPTION, CELEBRATING \n CHILDREN AND FAMILIES INVOLVED IN ADOPTION, AND ENCOURAGING AMERICANS \n     TO SECURE SAFETY, PERMANENCY, AND WELL-BEING FOR ALL CHILDREN\n\n      Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Mr. DeMint, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Nelson \n        of Nebraska, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Craig, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Coleman, \n        and Mr. Salazar) submitted the following resolution; which was \n        considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

In Texas alone, over \n     45,000 displaced students have enrolled in schools.\n       (4) In response to these extraordinary conditions, this \n     subtitle creates a one-time only emergency grant for the \n     2005-2006 school year tailored to the needs and particular \n     circumstances of students displaced by Hurricane Katrina.\n\n     SEC. 7953.

Con. Res. \n95); which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       On page 256, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n\n                   Subchapter D--Sense of the Senate\n\n     SEC. 6065. TO EXPRESS THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING \n                   MEDICAID RECONCILIATION LEGISLATION TO BE \n                   REPORTED BY A CONFERENCE COMMITTEE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Medicaid program provides essential health care and \n     long-term care services to more than 50,000,000 low-income \n     children, pregnant women, parents, individuals with \n     disabilities, and senior citizens. It is a Federal guarantee \n     that ensures that the most vulnerable will have access to \n     needed medical services.\n       (2) The Medicaid program provides critical access to long-\n     term care and other services for the elderly and individuals \n     living with disabilities, and is the single largest provider \n     of long-term care services. The Medicaid program also pays \n     for personal care and other supportive services that are \n     typically not provided by private health insurance or under \n     the Medicare program, but are necessary to enable individuals \n     with spinal cord injuries, developmental disabilities, \n     neurological degenerative diseases, serious and persistent \n     mental illnesses, HIV/AIDS, and other chronic conditions to \n     remain in the community, to work, and to maintain \n     independence.\n       (3) The Medicaid program supplements the Medicare program \n     for more than 6,000,000 low-income elderly or disabled \n     Medicare beneficiaries, assisting those beneficiaries with \n     their Medicare premiums and co-insurance, wrap-around \n     benefits, and the costs of nursing home care that the \n     Medicare program does not cover. The Medicaid program spent \n     nearly $40,000,000,000 in 2002 on services not covered under \n     the Medicare program.\n       (4) The Medicaid program provides health insurance for more \n     than \\1/4\\ of America's children and is the largest purchaser \n     of maternity care, paying for more than \\1/3\\ of all the \n     births in the United States each year. The Medicaid program \n     also provides vital access to care for children with \n     disabilities, covering more than 70 percent of the poor \n     children with disabilities in the United States.\n       (5) Medicaid's benefits for children are comprehensive, \n     including mandatory coverage for Early and Periodic Screening \n     Diagnosis and Treatment benefits covering all medically \n     necessary care. Medicaid ensures that children have the \n     benefits, health services and health care support they need \n     to be fully immunized and that children can secure \n     eyeglasses, dental care, and hearing aids when necessary, and \n     that children have access to comprehensive, regularly \n     scheduled, and as-needed health examinations, as well as \n     preventive interventions, to correct physical and mental \n     conditions that threaten to delay proper growth and \n     development.\n       (6) More than 16,000,000 American women depend on the \n     Medicaid program for their health care. Women comprise the \n     majority of seniors (71 percent) on Medicaid. Half of \n     nonelderly women with permanent mental or physical \n     disabilities have health care coverage under the Medicaid \n     program. The Medicaid program also provides critical access \n     to treatment for low-income women diagnosed with breast or \n     cervical cancer.\n       (7) The Medicaid program is the Nation's largest source of \n     payment for mental health services, HIV/AIDS care, and care \n     for children with special needs. Much of this care is either \n     not covered by private insurance or is limited in scope or \n     duration. The Medicaid program is also a critical source of \n     funding for health care for children in foster care and for \n     health care services provided in schools.\n       (8) Funds under the Medicaid program help to ensure access \n     to care for all Americans. The Medicaid program is the single \n     largest source of revenue for the Nation's safety net \n     hospitals, health centers, and nursing homes, and is critical \n     to the ability of these providers to adequately serve all \n     Americans.\n       (9) The Medicaid program serves a major role in ensuring \n     that the number of Americans without health insurance, \n     approximately 45,000,000 in 2003, is not substantially \n     higher. The system of Federal matching for State Medicaid \n     expenditures ensures that Federal funds will grow as State \n     spending increases in response to unmet needs, enabling the \n     Medicaid program to help buffer the drop in private coverage \n     during recessions. More than 4,800,000 Americans lost \n     employer-sponsored health care coverage between 2000 and \n     2003, during which time the Medicaid program enrolled an \n     additional 8,400,000 Americans.\n       (10) Many individuals living below the Federal poverty \n     level are ineligible for Medicaid because of stringent income \n     eligibility rules. For parents, eligibility levels are often \n     very far below the Federal poverty level. On average, a \n     working parent in a family of three would have to make less \n     than $224 per week and a non-working parent in a family of \n     three would have to make less than $150 per week to qualify. \n     Single individuals with disabilities would be ineligible if \n     they have more than $147 per week in income.\n       (11) Eligibility levels for pregnant women and children are \n     generally at or just above the Federal poverty level, but a \n     family with income just over minimum wage can be disqualified \n     for Medicaid. At the minimum eligibility levels for pregnant \n     women, earning as little as $8.80 per hour at a full-time job \n     could disqualify a pregnant woman from Medicaid eligibility. \n     A working parent in a family of three earning less than $8.40 \n     per hour at a full-time job could make their child 6 years-\n     old or older ineligible for Medicaid.\n       (12) Title III of the budget reconciliation bill of the \n     House of Representatives, as reported out by the Committee on \n     Energy and Commerce, would adversely affect these low-income \n     beneficiaries, many of whom are children or have special \n     health care needs, by increasing beneficiary cost-sharing, \n     limiting access to benefits, and restricting eligibility for \n     long-term care services that the Medicaid program covers. \n     These new limits make up \\2/3\\ of the House of \n     Representative's projected Medicaid spending reductions, \n     accounting for $30,100,000,000 of the total $45,300,000,000 \n     in Medicaid reductions over 10 years.\n       (13) Making beneficiaries pay more for more limited \n     benefits under Medicaid may put a significant financial \n     burden on these very low-income individuals. Research also \n     demonstrates that increasing beneficiary cost-sharing can \n     make prescription drugs and other essential health services \n     unaffordable for beneficiaries, can cause the health of \n     children and adults to deteriorate, and can lead to higher \n     emergency room and hospital costs.\n       (14) By contrast, while this title includes substantial \n     cuts to the Medicaid program, it does not include direct \n     limits on beneficiary access to Medicaid services. Even so, \n     enactment of this title would result in a net Medicaid cut of \n     $14,200,000,000 over 10 years, less than \\1/3\\ of the \n     projected Medicaid reductions contained in the House of \n     Representative's budget reconciliation bill.\n\n[[Page S12367]]\n\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the conferees for any budget reconciliation bill of the \n     109th Congress shall not report a reconciliation bill that \n     would--\n       (1) with respect to low-income children, pregnant women, \n     disabled individuals, elderly individuals, individuals with \n     chronic illnesses like HIV/AIDS, cancer, and diabetes, \n     individuals with mental illnesses, and other Medicaid \n     beneficiaries--\n       (A) impair access to Medicaid services;\n       (B) undermine eligibility for such Medicaid beneficiaries;\n       (C) make Medicaid services unavailable by making them \n     unaffordable to such Medicaid beneficiaries; or\n       (D) cut health care services for such Medicaid \n     beneficiaries; or\n       (2) undermine the Federal guarantee of health insurance \n     coverage that the Medicaid program provides, which would \n     threaten not only the health care safety net of the United \n     States, but the entire health care system of the United \n     States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2411.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 300 submitted earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 300) relative to the death of Henry \n     Ku'ualoha Giugni, former Sergeant-at-Arms of the United \n     States Senate.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am deeply saddened to inform my \ncolleagues that at 3:30 this morning, my friend and colleague, Henry \nGiugni, passed away at Shady Grove Adventist Hospital in Rockville, MD. \nHis passing is a great loss for the people of Hawaii, the United \nStates, and the Senate, an institution he loved dearly, and in which he \nserved as its 30th Sergeant at Arms for 4 years, beginning on January \n6, 1987.\n  I had the privilege of knowing Henry for nearly 50 years, beginning \nin 1956 when he joined my re-election campaign to the Hawaii \nTerritorial House of Representatives. We quickly forged an unbreakable \nbond.\n  With his tireless work, dedication, and loyalty, he proved invaluable \nas the top aide on my staff when I served as a Hawaii legislator, U.S. \nRepresentative, and U.S. Senator.\n  His keen political instincts also made him invaluable on campaigns, \nand beginning with my first congressional race in 1959, when I \nsuccessfully ran to be the State of Hawaii's first U.S. Representative, \nhe coordinated my campaign activities on all of Hawaii's islands.\n  And, I am proud to say, I once anointed Henry as ``the supreme \ncommander of Hawaiian politics'' in recognition of his political acumen \nand skill as a political strategist. It was an unofficial title that \nHenry relished.\n  Henry also enjoyed being called ``Dr. Giugni.'' Circumstances \nprevented him from receiving his undergraduate degree, but 2 years ago, \nthe University of Hawaii at Hilo conferred upon him an honorary \ndoctorate of humane letters for his exemplary service to the State of \nHawaii and the Nation, and for serving as a role model for Native \nHawaiians. It was an honor he truly deserved.\n  From January 6, 1987, to December 31, 1990, Henry served as the \nSenate's Sergeant at Arms, ably managing a budget of nearly $120 \nmillion, overseeing a staff of more than 2,000, and supervising support \nservices, which included law enforcement and telecommunications.\n  More importantly, as the first person of color and the first person \nof Polynesian ancestry to serve in this position, he left an indelible \nmark during his tenure by promoting minorities and women. He appointed \nthe first minority, an African-American man, to lead the Sergeant at \nArms' Service Department, and he was the first to assign women to the \nCapitol Police plainclothes unit.\n  His special interest in people with disabilities resulted in a major \nexpansion of the Special Services Office, which now conducts tours of \nthe U.S. Capitol for the blind, deaf, and wheelchair-bound, and \npublishes Senate maps and documents in Braille.\n  In 1991, Henry joined Cassidy & Associates, one of Washington's \nleading public policy consulting firms. With his intimate knowledge of \nHawaii and Washington, and with a vast network of contacts that spanned \nthe entire country and crossed party lines, Henry was able to continue \nhis support for policies that he believed best served the Nation.\n  Even as a high-powered vice chairman of Cassidy & Associates, Henry \ncontinued to describe himself as ``just a poor Hawaiian boy.'' Henry's \nsoul was very much Hawaiian, but he was never poor in experience, \ngenerosity of the heart, or patriotism.\n  After the attack on Pearl Harbor, he enlisted in the Army at the age \nof 16, and saw combat at Guadalcanal. He was part of the Hawaii \ndelegation that greeted then-Vice President Lyndon Baines Johnson in \nthe islands just before the start of the Cuban missile crisis. As a \nstaunch support of civil rights, he carried the Hawaii flag and marched \nwith Dr. Martin Luther King in Selma, AL.\n  He volunteered to drive Senator Edward Kennedy following the \nassassination of his brother, President John F. Kennedy. Henry was also \na member of one of the first official delegations that traveled to the \nPeople's Republic of China following President Nixon's historic visit.\n  As Senate Sergeant at Arms, he presided over the inauguration of \nPresident George H.W. Bush, and escorted numerous foreign dignitaries, \nincluding Nelson Mandela, Margaret Thatcher, and Vaclav Havel, when \nthey visited the U.S. Capitol.\n  Indeed, for a ``poor Hawaiian boy'' who was born in Hawaii in 1925 to \nAlfred Giugni and Kealoha Hookano, Henry has done much on the national \nstage since his days when he studied at Hanahauoli School, Iolani \nSchool, and the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and when he worked as a \nHonolulu firefighter, police officer, and liquor inspector.\n\n[[Page S12373]]\n\n  However, while he was an acquaintance of Presidents and kings, his \nheart was always with the native people of Hawaii, who are still \nstruggling for their moment in the sun.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and all who have known and loved Henry \nin expressing our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Muriel Roselani; \nhis four daughters, H. Kealoha Giugni, Deborah Roselani McMillan, \nHeather Haunani Giugni, and Gina Pilialoha Giugni-Halbach; 11 \ngrandchildren; and 12 great-grandchildren.\n  I look forward to submitting a resolution expressing our condolences \nto the Giugni family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it is with deep sadness that I learned of \nthe death of Henry K. Giugni, who passed away this morning. He was a \nformer Sergeant at Arms.\n  In January 1987, it was my pleasure, as the Senate majority leader, \nto nominate Mr. Giugni to be the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate. When \nthe Senate elected him to the position, Mr. Giugni became not only the \nthirtieth Sergeant at Arms of the Senate, he became the first \nPolynesian-American to serve in this capacity.\n  Mr. Giugni brought a wealth of experience to this most important \nSenate position. Born in Hawaii in 1925, he enlisted in the U.S. Army \nduring World War II. After the war, he joined the Honolulu Police \nForce. From 1963 to 1987, he had served as the administrative assistant \nin the office of my dear friend and colleague, my hero--Senator Daniel \nK. Inouye.\n  As the second ranking officer in the United States Senate, Mr. Giugni \nperformed the duties of the office of Sergeant at Arms of the Senate \nproudly and with distinction. In his 4 years as head of the largest \noffice in the Senate, Mr. Giugni supervised a number of major changes \nand improvements. This included the purchase and installation of \nmillions of dollars of new computer and telecommunications equipment \nfor Senators and their offices.\n  Mr. Giugni took special pride in having helped to make the U.S. \nCapitol accessible to the disabled by expanding the Special Services \nOffice. Under his direction, the office implemented tours and other \nprograms for the disabled, and published a braille version of Senate \ndocuments.\n  Sergeant at Arms Giugni worked with the House Sergeant at Arms to \nimprove the operation of the Capitol Police Force. And, his office \ninstituted cost-effective measures of hiring civilian guards to perform \nduties which he did not believe required uniformed officers.\n  Mr. Giugni left his work at the Senate in 1990 to become vice \npresident of corporate development for Washington, DC, firm, Cassidy \nAssociates. His presence in the Senate, and his devotion to it, were \nquickly and sorely missed. But I was pleased and proud of having \nnominated him to this most important position, and I was even more \npleased and proud of the work he had performed while there.\n  I close my remarks with a poem that I have always cherished. It is a \npoem that evokes the triumph of a life well lived over the sorrow of \ndeath. It is a poem that addresses the life and career of my good \nfriend, Henry K. Giugni.\n\n     Let fate do her worst, there are relics of joy,\n     Bright dreams of the past, which she cannot destroy;\n     that come, in the nighttime of sorrow and care,\n     And bring back the features that joy used to wear.\n     Long, long be my heart with such memories filled,\n     Like the vase in which roses have once been distilled,\n     You may break, you may shatter the vase, if you will,\n     But the scent of the roses will hang around it still.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to say a few \nwords of a dear friend, Henry Giugni, who passed away this morning. \nHenry enjoyed an illustrious career both on and off Capitol Hill. He \nbegan his career in Washington as Senator Inouye's Chief of Staff and \ncontinued until he was appointed Sergeant at Arms of the United States \nSenate. In both positions, he enjoyed the confidence and respect of all \nand he served them well. He was a well-recognized presence on the Hill, \nparticularly in the Senate. After leaving the Hill, Henry joined one of \nthe largest consulting firms in Washington where he was serving his \nclients effectively.\n  I will remember Henry as one of the first friends who welcomed me and \nmy family to Washington when I was elected to Congress nearly 30 years \nago. His kindness continued over many years and we knew him to be a \nloving husband and father. Millie and I always appreciated his visits \nwhether for business or a social call.\n  It was only a few weeks ago that Millie and I chatted with him and we \nwere extremely saddened to hear of his passing. Millie and I express \nour warmest aloha to his wife Lani and their family. Henry was our dear \nand cherished friend and we will miss him greatly. God bless Henry and \nhis family. May he rest in peace.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and any statements relating thereto be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 300) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n       Whereas Henry Ku`ualoha Giugni was born on January 11, \n     1925, in Honolulu, Hawai`i;\n       Whereas Henry Giugni served with distinction in the United \n     States Army, after enlisting at the age of 16 after the \n     attacks on Pearl Harbor, and served in combat at the Battle \n     of Guadalcanal during World War II;\n       Whereas Henry Giugni began his service in the Senate in \n     1963 as Senior Executive Assistant and Chief of Staff to \n     Senator Daniel K.

We will return to the \nbill on Monday and, as announced earlier, we will begin voting Monday \nevening at approximately 5:30.\n  Again, I appreciate everyone's patience over the last 9 hours. Vote-\naramas are not a pretty part of the budget process, but under the \ndirection of our able, our outstanding chairman and ranking member, it \nwas made a lot less painful than it could have been. They give \ntremendous success to the American people--35, or just right at $35 \nbillion in savings, and that goes directly to the bottom line when it \ncomes to deficit reduction. As we travel around the country, people \nwill say: Get serious, Congress, on fiscal discipline, on spending.\n  Well, this is the first time in 8 years that this body has gone after \nmandatory spending in a responsible way to the tune of $35 billion.\n  I also wish to thank my colleague, the assistant Republican leader, \nMitch McConnell, who did a tremendous job. We had, I guess, 22 rollcall \nvotes today, and he did a terrific job in terms of whipping those votes \non our side of the aisle, a truly remarkable accomplishment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/03/senate-section/article/S12374-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
