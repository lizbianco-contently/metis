The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4097.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To modify the requirements for confidentiality of certain \ninformation submitted by an alien seeking an adjustment of status under \n                             section 245B)\n\n       Beginning on page 362, strike line 4 and all that follows \n     through page 363, line 12, and insert the following:\n       ``(e) Confidentiality of Information.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2) or \n     (3) or as otherwise provided in this section, or pursuant to \n     written waiver of the applicant or order of a court of \n     competent jurisdiction, no Federal agency or bureau, or any \n     officer or employee of such agency or bureau, may--\n       ``(A) use the information furnished by the applicant \n     pursuant to an application filed under paragraph (1) or (2) \n     of subsection (a) for any purpose other than to make a \n     determination on the application;\n       ``(B) make any publication through which the information \n     furnished by any particular applicant can be identified; or\n       ``(C) permit anyone other than the sworn officers and \n     employees of such agency, bureau, or approved entity, as \n     approved by the Secretary of Homeland Security, to examine \n     individual applications that have been filed.\n       ``(2) Required disclosures.--The Secretary of Homeland \n     Security and the Secretary of State shall provide the \n     information furnished pursuant to an application filed under \n     paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (a), and any other \n     information derived from such furnished information, to--\n       ``(A) a duly recognized law enforcement entity in \n     connection with a criminal investigation or prosecution or a \n     national security investigation or prosecution, in each \n     instance about an individual suspect or group of suspects, \n     when such information is requested by such entity; or\n\n[[Page S5136]]\n\n       ``(B) an official coroner for purposes of affirmatively \n     identifying a deceased individual, whether or not the death \n     of such individual resulted from a crime.\n       ``(3) Inapplicability after denial.--The limitation under \n     paragraph (1)--\n       ``(A) shall apply only until an application filed under \n     paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (a) is denied and all \n     opportunities for appeal of the denial have been exhausted; \n     and\n       ``(B) shall not apply to use of the information furnished \n     pursuant to such application in any removal proceeding or \n     other criminal or civil case or action relating to an alien \n     whose application has been granted that is based upon any \n     violation of law committed or discovered after such grant.\n       ``(4) Criminal penalty.--Any person who knowingly uses, \n     publishes, or permits information to be examined in violation \n     of this subsection shall be fined not more than $10,000.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this amendment is one I believe is \nabsolutely essential to the functioning of this comprehensive \nimmigration reform plan which has been shaped over the last 2 weeks on \nthe Senate floor. It is premised upon the concept of information \nsharing, and in a post-9/11 world this is the concept with which we \nhave become familiar because the failure to share information between \nlaw enforcement and intelligence-gathering authorities and other \nagencies of the Federal Government was one of the causes of the \nterrible disaster this country sustained on September 11, 2001.\n  This amendment strikes an appropriate balance between confidentiality \nof the records of the applicant for benefits under this bill and fraud \ndetection. The compromise we have heard and which has been carefully \ncrafted by a bipartisan coalition here will not in any way be unraveled \nor hurt by this amendment.\n  Finally, I believe an illegal alien will not be deterred from \napplying because of this amendment. This amendment does not remove \nconfidentiality per se. It applies only after an application is denied \nand the need for confidentiality passes. The text is modeled after the \nViolence Against Women Act. And I ask my colleagues, if the limitation \non confidentiality is OK in the case of women who are subjected to \nviolence, why isn't it OK for workers who are simply here illegally?\n  This country's early experience--about 20 years ago now--with \nimmigration reform shows that legalization or an amnesty program is a \nmagnet for fraud and can be exploited in a number of ways. We know that \nthis vulnerability can be exploited, not only by common criminals but \nalso by terrorists. Three terrorists convicted in the 1993 World Trade \nCenter bombing obtained green cards through the 1986 amnesty, including \nNew York City cabdriver Mohammed Abouhalima, who obtained a green card \nthrough the agricultural worker amnesty program. The New York Times has \ndescribed the 1986 amnesty as ``one of the most extensive immigration \nfrauds ever perpetrated against the United States Government.''\n  Within just a few years, it was reported that the Government had \nalready identified almost 400,000 cases of possible fraud. One of the \nreasons there was so much fraud in the 1986 amnesty was because the law \ndid not allow the Government to share information even after an \napplication was denied. Yet the current bill contains the exact same \ntext and the exact same flaws.\n  My amendment does not eliminate any confidentiality provisions in the \nbill. The workers who apply will be protected by the existing \nconfidentiality provisions. My amendment simply allows the Government \nto share and use information once the worker's application and all \nappeals are denied.\n  As I mentioned, my amendment is modeled after the current legal \nprotections provided in the Violence Against Women Act, which allows \nthe Government to share and use information submitted in an application \n``when the application for relief is denied and all opportunities for \nappeal of that denial have been exhausted.'' If the limitation is OK in \nthat context, why is it not appropriate in this context?\n  I don't believe this amendment would deter any alien from applying \nfor legal status. Illegal workers face deportation, a secure border, \nand worksite enforcement. We may hear some say that in order for \nundocumented individuals to come forward and take advantage of the \nlegalization program provided by this underlying bill, we can't do \nanything that might cause them to second-guess or question whether they \nshould come forward. But the fact is, I think there has to be a balance \nstruck. I don't believe any illegal alien will be deterred from \nparticipating in the very generous provisions of this underlying bill \nbecause of concerns that if their application is denied, that \ninformation can then be shared with law enforcement personnel.\n  The fact is, the kinds of things we are looking out for are fraud--\nmassive fraud--schemes which would be designed to undermine the very \nstructure of this negotiated comprehensive immigration reform bill.\n  Paul Virtue, President Clinton's general counsel at the Immigration \nand Naturalization Service, testified before Congress that:\n\n       The confidentiality restrictions of law [in the 1986 \n     amnesty] also prevented INS from pursuing cases of possible \n     fraud detected during the application process.\n\n  That was before the House Judiciary Committee on March 4, 1999.\n  One of our colleagues who was then in the House of Representatives, \nSenator Schumer, was quoted in the New York Times in 1989 as saying:\n\n       One certain product of the agricultural amnesty program . . \n     . is that in developing immigration policies in the future, \n     Congress will be much more wary of the potential for fraud \n     and will do more to stop it.\n\n  It has been said famously that those who refuse to learn from history \nare condemned to relive it. I suggest to my colleagues that we should \nhave learned something from the massive fraud in the 1986 amnesty, and \nwe should not relive that in this bill today.\n  This amendment improves the current bill by preserving the \nconfidentiality of applicants while allowing the Government to share \ninformation, perhaps to uncover massive frauds, criminal syndicates \nthat are designed to try to circumvent the protections in this bill and \ngain access to our country and our immigration system in spite of \nmassive criminal organized crime. I ask my colleagues, do we really \nwant to grant impunity for fraud? Do we really want to invite criminals \nand those who would perpetrate such fraud to do so again when we have \nthe very tools at our command which will allow us to strike the proper \nbalance between prosecution for fraud and yet at the same time \nencouraging those who would benefit from this program to come forward?\n  I have heard some suggestion that the only way we are going to \nencourage people to come forward is if we make doing so an \nunequivocally positive experience. In other words, it is all carrot and \nno stick. But I would suggest that the most practical way to deal with \nthe current situation is for a combination of carrot and stick--the \ncarrot being, obviously, the offer of the great benefits and very \ngenerous benefits provided by this underlying legislation, but the \nstick has to be things such as worksite verification. Ultimately, I \nbelieve that is the linchpin of the success of this entire program. Not \neven border security represents the linchpin for the success of this \ncomprehensive immigration reform plan because 45 percent of illegal \naliens currently in the United States entered legally, like the three \nconvicted bombers of the 1993 World Trade Center explosion. But we need \na combination of border security, worksite verification and \nenforcement, and employer sanctions for those who cheat, in order to \ndry up the attraction of those who want to come to the United States to \nwork. But in doing so, we can provide a good balance for those who are \nhere and who Congress is in the process of determining should be \navailable for certain benefits under this bill, but I believe do so in \na way that would prevent and make far less likely the massive fraud \nwhich undermined the 1986 amnesty.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I was here in 1986. I understand the 1986 \nact very well. I listened to my friend from Texas describe the \nprovisions we have for earned legalization, saying effectively it is \nthe same as offered in 1986. Of course, it is not because in 1986 that \nwas a real amnesty. We have had that debate for 10 days. We can have it \nagain today.\n  What we are talking about in this program is recognizing the people \nwho have violated the law are able to work\n\n[[Page S5137]]\n\nand earn their way into a position where eventually they can apply for \ncitizenship if they pay a penalty, if they demonstrate they have paid \ntheir back taxes, have had no trouble with the law, and they are \nprepared to learn English. After the last person in line legitimately \nis able to gain entry into the United States, they can adjust their \nstatus.\n  The 1986 failure is entirely different than what we have now. We had \na proliferation of fraudulent documents. That is the history. We \nunderstand that. We had Republican and Democrat administrations that \nrefused to enforce the 1986 laws. That is history. We can complain \nabout 1986, but 1986 is not 2006. What we did in 1986 is not 2006.\n  We can talk about how some of the terrorists got into the United \nStates. Most of the September 11 terrorists got into the United States \nthrough Saudi Arabia. The reason they got in is because the CIA didn't \ntalk to the FBI or the Immigration Service. The majority of those who \ncame here and were part of September 11 were known by the CIA, and they \nnever shared that information with the Immigration Service or the FBI. \nThey did not need fraudulent documents. We needed the FBI and CIA to \nwork together.\n  Having said that, hopefully we have a better relationship between the \nCentral Intelligence Agency and the FBI now than we had then. However, \nthat is the past. We have to learn from the past.\n  I listened to the Senator say what we need is tamper-proof documents. \nIf we do not have tamper-proof documents, this system is not going to \nwork. Tamper-proof documents is what we are committed to, to try and \ndeal with the fraud.\n  People can come to the Senate and talk about the fraud in our \nimmigration system, which is true. What we are trying to do with this \nlegislation is remedy that. I don't know what the alternative is from \nthe Senator from Texas. I know what his concerns are, but I don't know \nwhat his remedy is. We are talking about tamper-proof documents. We are \ntalking about tamper-proof documents for guest workers. We are talking \nabout tamper-proof documents so laws can be enforced against employers \nwho are going to fire undocumented individuals who do not have the \ntamper-proof documents. We are talking about tamper-proof documents for \nthose individuals who want to play by the rules and go by earned \nlegalization.\n  The language in this legislation is very clear. That is, if you lie \non your application, you lose all your rights, and you are subject to \ndeportation. However, if you commit an innocent mistake on your \napplication, that can be considered and not be used as a vehicle for \ndeportation. That is the principal difference. I don't think that is \nunreasonable.\n  The Senator believes if we do not change what we have in our law to \nwhat he wants, if we accept his amendment, people will not be \ndiscouraged from coming forth. Of course they will be discouraged from \ncoming forth. People come forth and they, in good faith, make an \napplication. They find out that application somehow is defective. \nWhether it is willful, knowing, or they lied about it, they are subject \nto deportation. If it is an innocent mistake, we don't want them \ndeported. If this is subject to the Cornyn amendment, why are they \ngoing to come forward and share information if they know if they share \ninformation confidentially they will be deported? We are undermining an \nessential aspect of this legislation--bringing people out of the \nshadows.\n  Of the millions of people who are here, we have people who have come \nhere because they want to work hard, they want to provide for their \nfamilies, they want to be part of the American dream. They are prepared \nto learn English. They are prepared to pay their taxes. They are \nprepared to pay their penalty. They want a sense of pride. They \npractice their faith. They want to be able to come in and be able to \nadjust their status so they can be legalized to have the respect of \ntheir children, their family, and their community. That is what the \ngreat majority of the people want. That is what we are trying to do.\n  If we follow the Cornyn amendment, people come in good faith, someone \nfly-specs that particular application and says: No, it is a question \nwhether this is criminal intent--boom, you are gone; you are deported. \nWe will have a very difficult time.\n  We have crafted this legislation so those who are going to lie on \nthat application, those who are involved in criminal activity are \nsubject to deportation--no ifs, ands or buts. But we also understand in \nthis complicated world there will be innocent mistakes made, and we do \nnot want to subject those people to deportation. That is not what this \nis about.\n  It seems to me honest people who submit a good-faith application to \nearn legalization should not be citing their own deportation orders; \notherwise, why should anyone apply? That effectively is what the Cornyn \namendment does. It effectively undermines the whole purpose and scope \nand thrust of the legislation.\n  I withhold the time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I have enormous respect for the knowledge and passion the \nSenator from Massachusetts brings to this issue. He is reading more \ninto the amendment than certainly I intend. I would like to explain \nthat.\n  First of all, I don't want to get into an argument with him today \nabout what is and what is not amnesty. We have had that debate. We will \nleave further discussion of that for another day.\n  I agree with the Senator that what undermined the 1986 amnesty, which \nI think we both agree was amnesty, was the proliferation, as he said, \nof fraudulent documents. He acknowledges, and correctly so, coming here \nnow 5 years post-September 11, that it is important all of our law \nenforcement and intelligence agencies communicate with one another in a \nway that protects the American people.\n  He talks about tamper-proof documents. This bill does not provide for \nsuch tamper-proof documents. In fact, it maintains the current regime \nof allowing people to prove their eligibility to work by showing some \ncombination of up to 20 different documents. That is where fraud has \nsuch great potential. We know there are document mills, there are \ncriminal organizations that will generate a passport, a Social Security \ncard, a driver's license--you name it. Some of the quality of their \nwork is very high, and it easily passes for a valid document. But we do \nnot have that tamper-proof document in this bill, and I hope in the \nconference committee we will agree among ourselves that is an essential \npart of this comprehensive immigration reform.\n  What I am getting is, if someone used a fraudulent document to apply \nfor the benefits under this bill, and they are denied the benefits \nunder this legalization program, that information ought to be shared \nwith the FBI and with, potentially, the CIA in cases where their \njurisdiction is invoked. This has the opportunity not only to lead our \nlaw enforcement personnel to shut down these fraudulent document mills, \nbut also potentially to crack criminal syndicates engaged not only in \ngenerating false documents but trafficking in persons, in drugs, in \nguns, and even potentially terrorist organizations.\n  It is absolutely critical we have the Department of Homeland Security \nable to share that kind of information with the CIA and the FBI. It is \nimportant we bring down those stovepipes that prevented the information \nsharing that might have prevented September 11.\n  I am not suggesting a good-faith mistake in an application for the \nbenefits under this bill would result in deportation. To the contrary. \nI am glad to hear the Senator from Massachusetts say, if you lie, you \nlose, you get deported. I believe we need to have a commonsense \navailability of this information--not on a widespread basis; we are not \ngoing to publish it on the Internet. But law enforcement ought to be \nable to share in some of this information on a case-by-case basis in a \nway designed not only to root out and prevent crime and punish crimes \nthat already have been committed but potentially protect America \nagainst future terrorist attacks.\n  I cannot for the life of me understand why this is controversial, \nparticularly coming up as we are on the fifth anniversary of September \n11.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, under title III, there are \nonly 4 documents, not 20 documents. Title III,\n\n[[Page S5138]]\n\n4 documents: the passports, REAL ID, the green cards, and employment \nauthorization documents. They are basically biometric documents, 4 \ndocuments in title III, not 20.\n  Second, the Senator from Texas is describing the conditions we had in \n1986, not in this legislation. There is the encouragement of \ncooperation with the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI when \nwe have document fraud or when there is fraud. We make that extremely \nclear. That was not clear, as the Senator appropriately pointed out, in \n1986. There was not that kind of cooperation. There was some but not \nnearly what there should be. We are all for that.\n  The confidentiality clause in the underlying bill does not protect \nthe criminals. On the contrary, the bill requires DHS and State to \ndisclose all information furnished by legalization applicants to law \nenforcement entities conducting criminal activity and national security \ninvestigations.\n  We learned from what we called IRKA, the 1986 act, and we have that \nin the legislation. On page 38 of the legislation:\n\n       Other documents.--Not later than October 26, 2007, every \n     document, other than an interim document, issued by the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security, which may be used as evidence \n     of an alien's status as an immigrant, nonimmigrant, parolee, \n     asylee, or refugee, shall be machine-readable and tamper-\n     resistant, and shall incorporate a biometric identifier to \n     allow the Secretary of Homeland Security to verify \n     electronically the identity and status of the alien.\n\n  We have spent time on it. I am a strong believer that is what we \nneed. This legislation is not going to work unless we have an effective \nsystem, unique, special. Other countries have this; we ought to be able \nto do it, many of the countries in the Far East, also Brazil, South \nAmerica, and other countries. We can and should do it. We will do it. \nWe have developed the language to do it.\n  We are for prime documents that have been accepted and recommended. \nWe worked with the Department of Homeland Security on what documents \nthey are for. We have insisted on cooperation between the FBI, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and the Justice Department in any area \nof criminality.\n  We are all for at least what I understand the Senator has said. We \nare glad to clarify that. We believe we have attended to that.\n  There is no question in 1986 that was not the case. We were rife with \nfraudulent documents, failure to enforce the law against employers, \nseparation between the INS at that time and the FBI. We did not have \nthe Department of Homeland Security. All of that we have learned from. \nWe have addressed the principal issues and questions the good Senator \nhas outlined.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, but looking at the page he refers to on page 38 of \nthe bill, it says:\n\n       Not later than October 26, 2007, every document, other than \n     an interim document, issued by the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security . . . shall be machine-readable and tamper-\n     resistant. . . .\n\n  I certainly applaud that aspirational goal. I would just note that \njust within the past few days, though, we have postponed the \nimplementation of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative card for \nanother 18 months. There is no certainty that will happen by that date. \nWhat happens in the interim?\n  Let me just provide a couple of examples.\n  In 1995, Jose Velez, was found guilty of immigration fraud after he \nfiled fraudulent applications under the 1986 amnesty. Let me just \nparenthetically note, in talking to Emilio Gonzalez, the current head \nof Citizenship and Immigration Services, he tells me there is still \nlitigation over some of the cases covered by the 1986 amnesty--still in \nlitigation.\n  But getting back to Mr. Velez's case, he said the task force that \nbrought down Velez resulted in the guilty pleas or convictions of 20 \nindividuals who together are responsible for filing false legalization \napplications for in excess of 11,000 unqualified aliens. Between March \nof 1988 and January of 1991, Velez and his coconspirators submitted \napproximately 3,000 fraudulent applications.\n  In connection with the 1986 legalization program, there were 920 \narrests, 822 indictments, and 513 convictions for fraud and related \ncriminal activity.\n  I would just return to something I said at the outset.\n  What we are talking about in this amendment is essentially the same \nlanguage contained in the Violence Against Women Act.\n  The language in that act, which was designed to protect battered \nwomen and family members, states that the confidentiality provisions \nend ``when the application for relief is denied and all opportunities \nfor appeal of the denial have been exhausted.''\n  I would suggest, if that language is good enough for the protection \nof women against whom violence has been committed, isn't it good enough \nfor a worker who is simply out of status?\n  This amendment is not designed to undercut the compromise or the \noverall structure of the plan that is on the floor. This is designed to \nmake it work. I want to make sure we are committed not only to \ncomprehensive immigration reform but that we are actually going to make \nit work. That is all this amendment does.\n  I ask for the support of my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and retain the remainder of our \ntime.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 1 hour of my time postcloture to the \nSenator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has that right.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, early this morning, as we do every \nmorning before coming to the floor to debate the immigration bill, a \ngroup of Senators sat down to consider and analyze the amendments which \nare on the list for today. In discussing the amendment by the Senator \nfrom Texas, there was, candidly, more confusion than I have seen on any \nof the amendments which we have analyzed so far.\n  When the Senator from Texas says the immunity is eliminated only \nafter the application is denied, then the reason for confidentiality \nends, I disagree with him about that because the reason for the \nconfidentiality is to get the applicant to be candid and complete and \nhonest about all of the information in the application. So if the \napplicant knows that at some point the confidentiality is gone, there \nis no longer the motivation to be completely open and completely candid \nin making out the application.\n  What we are really seeking, as a public policy matter, is to get the \napplicants to be candid and forthright and complete in the information \nthey are providing. If there is evidence of fraud in the application, \nor if there is evidence of crime, that will be provable by evidence \noutside the scope of the application.\n  There is another aspect of the confidentiality; that is, the \nconfidentiality or safe harbor which applies to the employer. When the \nimmigrant makes an application, there is material which has to be \nsupplied by the employer--illustrative of which is a check stub, which \nauthenticates that the applicant has a job.\n  Now, the confidentiality applies to what the employer provides as \nwell. The safe harbor or confidentiality protects the employer so the \nemployer does not run the risk of providing some information which ends \nup on the application, then is disclosed, that could be used against \nthe employer in a variety of contexts.\n  Now, it is possible that the amendment by the Senator from Texas \ncould be adopted and that aspect could be cured in conference. But it \nis my thought, after reflecting on it considerably, that the issues \nought to be weeded out and resolved in conference as opposed to having \nthe adoption of the Cornyn amendment.\n  The value of confidentiality to encourage the immigrant to make full \ndisclosure, and the value of confidentiality that the employer has, \noutweighs the advantages which the Senator from Texas articulates. And \nwhen the immigrant is faced with a situation where the confidentiality \nends at some point--it is hard enough for Senators and experienced \nlawyers to figure it all out, and expecting an immigrant to be able to \nfigure it out--I think the consequence for the immigrant will be to\n\n[[Page S5139]]\n\nbe hesitant and unwilling or chilled, if you will, to provide all the \ninformation.\n  My sense is that our system will work better if there is no ambiguity \nor no uncertainties to the confidentiality being maintained throughout \nthe entire process beyond when the application and appeals have all run \nout.\n  But this is an important issue. I thank the Senator from Texas for \nfocusing our attention on it. I do believe it is better addressed in \nconference.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on this amendment?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment's sponsor retains \n12\\1/2\\ minutes. The opponents retain 14 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I had announced earlier that in the \nmanagement of the bill we would stack the five votes we have remaining \non the immigration bill. I think that is the most efficient way to \nhandle the matter because we know when we have a 15-minute vote, and 5 \nminutes more, they frequently extend far beyond that time, not wanting \nto cut off Senators.\n  We had two Senators out last night. We went to about close to 30 \nminutes, and I did not want to call for regular order. Evenings are a \nlittle more difficult. But it is very difficult to cut off Senators \nwhen the Senator is on the way. The Senator can be on the way for a \nvery long period of time.\n  But I cannot control the stacking of votes because it requires \nunanimous consent to set aside the Cornyn amendment before going to the \nnext amendment. Anybody can object. So we are going to have a vote \nafter the Cornyn amendment. We will then try to see if we cannot get \nconsent to stack the remainder of the votes. But the earlier \nannouncement that the votes would be stacked will not take place \nbecause objections have been raised to that procedure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will take just a few minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, may I, before the Senator from \nMassachusetts continues, ask that the proponent of the next amendment \ncome to the--well, he will be in the vote, so I withdraw that \nsuggestion. We will have just one vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just along those lines, I think our \ncolleagues ought to be alerted we can anticipate a vote fairly shortly.\n  Mr. President, just in response to my friend from Texas, he is \nfamiliar with the fact that we passed the Border Security Act in 2002. \nThe idea was to understand everybody coming into this country, to know \nwhere they were, and when they were leaving. We have not completed that \nkind of circle, but we have made dramatic progress. As of now, every \ngreen card, every work permit, every visa is machine readable and \nbiometric--every single one that we have working today. So this is a \ndramatic shift in terms of dealing with the issue of fraud, which has \nbeen talked about here.\n  Now, in order for immigration reform--we have talked with security \nofficials who have all told us it is in our interest, in our national \nsecurity interest, to bring people out of the shadows. They have all \nindicated that. We have so many individuals here whose names we do not \nknow. We do not know their locations. They are living in a shadowy \nworld that can more often than not--or at least sometimes can--be \nconnected with crime. And many of these people, obviously, want a \ndifferent life and a different future.\n  To be able to make that progress and isolate those individuals who \npose a threat to us, our security officials who came before our \ncommittee said that a real confidentiality clause is necessary--\nabsolutely necessary--for the earned legalization to succeed, in order \nto have immigration reform. Current undocumented immigrants will have \nto be persuaded it is safe to come forward to an agency they have come \nto mistrust, and they will need to feel comfortable the information \nthey provide on their applications about their histories, their \nemployers, and their families will not be used against them or their \nloved ones.\n  Churches, community agencies, and attorneys who will be helping \npeople apply will also need confidence they are not exposing their \nclients to immigration enforcement by encouraging them to apply for \nlegalization.\n  I believe the change in the Cornyn amendment would make the \nconfidentiality clause worthless. Hundreds of thousands of immigrants \nwho qualify for earned legalization will likely be dissuaded from \nparticipating, undermining the effectiveness of our entire reform \neffort. And hundreds of thousands of immigrants would be encouraged to \nremain in the shadows rather than risk coming forward under these \nconditions.\n  The confidentiality clause in the underlying bill does not protect \ncriminals. On the contrary, the bill requires DHS and State to disclose \nall information--it is at the bottom of page 362 of the bill--unlike \nthe provisions the Senator referred to in the Violence Against Women \nprovisions. The penalties for the disclosure of information, and the \nexceptions: The Attorney General may provide, in the discretion of the \nAttorney General, the disclosure of information to law enforcement \nofficials to be used solely for law enforcement purposes.\n  Our legislation says:\n\n       The Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of \n     State shall provide the information furnished pursuant to an \n     application filed under [the] paragraph . . . and any other \n     information derived from such furnished information, to a \n     duly recognized law enforcement entity in connection with a \n     criminal investigation or prosecution or a national security \n     investigation or prosecution. . . .\n\n  Mr. President, I do not think you can do better than that. We are \neven stronger on this issue. I have mentioned the other reasons for it. \nI agree with the Senator from Texas. We have to put in place a very \neffective biometric system. We have a real downpayment for it. We want \nto strengthen that. But we are making very dramatic and significant \nprogress, and we will continue to do so.\n  We have indicated, in this most strenuous way, why we have drafted \nthese provisions the way they have been drafted. We think they best \nserve the interests of the innocent and the prosecution of the guilty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, it really boggles my mind we are having a \ndebate over such a commonsense and straightforward amendment coming up \non the anniversary of 9/11. To say the Department of Homeland Security \ncannot share information about potential fraud and crime and \npotentially disclose organized criminal activity and potentially even \nterrorist activity because of the provisions of this underlying bill--I \ncannot believe we are having that debate. But we are.\n\n  Hopefully, our colleagues will join us in accepting this amendment \nwhich will reconcile this bill with other provisions of the law that we \nhave amended and reformed over the last few years, which have improved \ninformation sharing between our intelligence community and our law \nenforcement agencies, which have made us safer. I don't think it is any \naccident that while there have been terrorist activities taking human \nlife in places such as Madrid and London and Beslan and other places, \nwe have been fortunate enough to avoid another travesty such as \noccurred on September 11. Part of it is because of information sharing.\n  This amendment would not deter any alien from applying for legal \nstatus. If we are going to say that once that application is denied for \nwhatever reason that it can't be used to investigate potential crimes \nand fraud and potential terrorist links, that doesn't do anything to \nencourage or discourage people from coming forward. This is somebody \nwhose application has already been denied. They already have come \nforward.\n  If we are going to have any criteria at all for taking 12 million \npeople and moving them from an illegal status to some sort of legal \nstatus, we ought to be willing to enforce that criteria. That requires \naccess to information and facts that will inform whether or not an \nindividual satisfies the criteria that Congress has put in place.\n  I suggest to my colleagues that the American people are profoundly \nskeptical of taking 12 million people from undocumented or illegal \nstatus and all of a sudden putting them on a path to legalization and \ncitizenship. That skepticism comes from many different directions. One \nof those is because they\n\n[[Page S5140]]\n\nsaw the tremendous fraud associated with the 1986 amnesty. The language \nhere is precisely the same as was contained in that legislation.\n  What we are saying by refusing to adopt this amendment is, we haven't \nlearned any lessons, either from the mistakes that were made in the \n1986 amnesty and the fraud that occurred in connection with that, or \nfrom the terrible tragedies of 9/11.\n  There is not a lot more that can be said about it that we haven't \nalready said. I hope my colleagues are listening. I hope they will \nconsider this carefully. I hope they will consider the fact that all we \nare doing is something that is contained in established laws such as \nthe Violence Against Women Act. This does not undermine the ability of \npeople to take advantage of the benefits of this program. What it does \nis help make that program work, work for people who are actually \nqualified to receive the benefits of the program while eliminating \nthose who are not and those who engage in fraud and criminal activities \nto facilitate the immigration into this country of people who are not \nlegally authorized to be here.\n  May I ask how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am glad the Senator from Texas invited \nour colleagues to listen carefully. I hope they will listen carefully \nto what I am reading from the underlying bill. No matter how many times \nthe Senator from Texas says he doesn't believe there will be reporting, \nprosecution, and cooperation between the agencies, I suggest that any \nof our colleagues who are in question read page 362 of the bill:\n\n       Required disclosures--The Secretary of Homeland Security \n     and the Secretary of State shall--\n\n  Not may, shall--\n\n       provide the information furnished to an application filed \n     under the paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (a), and any \n     other information derived from such furnished information, to \n     a duly recognized law enforcement entity in connection with a \n     criminal investigation or prosecution or a national security \n     investigation or prosecution, in each instance about an \n     individual suspect or group of suspects, when such \n     information is requested in writing by an entity.\n\n  I can't make it any clearer than that, with all respect. That was not \nthe way it was done previously. That is the way it is now. It has been \nmentioned, let's have the Violence Against Women Act legislation. I \nhave that in my hand. For our colleagues to understand, it says:\n\n       The Attorney General may provide, in the discretion of the \n     Attorney General, for the disclosure of information to law \n     enforcement officials.\n\n  We say ``shall provide.'' The Violence Against Women Act says ``may \nprovide.'' We have a much stronger provision.\n  We are not defending actions of the past. We are talking about \nlearning from the past. We have. Tamper-proof documents, we are \nstrongly committed to that, and fair and effective enforcement at the \nemployer level and, when we discover criminal activity--lying, deceit--\non these applications, prosecution. But let's not wrap the innocent \ninto that package as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I think we have said about all there is to \nsay. Maybe we said it several times. I appreciate the Senator from \nMassachusetts pointing out page 362 of the bill. This is a voluminous \nbill, but my reading of this bill says that the section the Senator \nquoted only applies to the applicant and that application. In other \nwords, if somebody fills out an application and is denied, then a \ncriminal prosecution investigation may be had only against that \napplicant, but there are limitations which prohibit its distribution to \nthird parties for purposes of investigating an organized crime \nsyndicate or potentially terrorist links. There seems to be no \ncommonsense reason why we would limit the availability of a document \nand that information, when it could well root out crimes involving \nhundreds and maybe even thousands of instances of fraud.\n  I believe the amendment strikes a balance. It is not designed to \nundermine the compromise that we have heard so much about. Indeed, this \nis to make sure that the underlying bill actually has a chance to work \nand isn't undermined by the fraud that has been so well documented \nunderlying the 1986 amnesty but, rather, to fight that fraud and help \nbuild public confidence that we are serious about making this work.\n  Much of the problem with the 1986 amnesty was that it granted amnesty \nto 3 million people. The tradeoff was supposed to be effective work \nsite verification to make sure that people who are qualified to work \nlegally could work and those who were not could not and to sanction \nemployers who cheat. But unless we have a system in place that will \nactually make it work, then all of the discussion about a comprehensive \nplan is a ruse. It will not work.\n  While I do have some differences with the Senator from Massachusetts \nabout what this comprehensive immigration reform plan ought to look \nlike, I trust we will be able to work on that some more when we get to \nconference with the House. My goal is to actually make sure it will \nwork. He and I share that common goal, I believe. The amendment I have \noffered helps make that more likely.\n  I am prepared to yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will make a brief comment. On page 119, \nimmigration and visa fraud, it says:\n\n       Any person who knowingly--completes, mails, prepares, \n     presents, signs, or submits any document knowing it to \n     contain any materially false statement or representation [is \n     subject to prosecution].\n\n  It continues on page 120:\n\n       . . . transfers or furnishes an immigration document to a \n     person without lawful authority for use . . .\n\n  Any lawyer or social service agency, advocacy group, or notary, or \nany other agent who assists an immigrant in making a fraudulent claim \nis subject to criminal prosecution and also unprotected by \nconfidentiality language.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the provisions in the underlying bill are \nthe same as those contained in the 1986 act that was the subject of so \nmuch fraud. I suggest that while we are all entitled to our own \nopinion, we are not entitled to our own set of facts. The facts are \nthat the same provisions in this underlying bill are in the 1986 act. \nWe can do better, and we can make this work. We can avoid the 400,000 \nfraudulent applications that tarnished the concept behind the 1986 \nbill.\n  I see the Senator from Alabama. May I inquire how many more minutes \nwe have on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has 4 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I am prepared to yield to the Senator from Alabama 3 \nminutes and retain 1 minute as the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for his \nexemplary and hard work on this legislation. From the beginning, had we \nlistened to him, we would not be in the fix we are. With regard to this \namendment, I have to tell my colleagues, it is a defining amendment. It \ndefines us as a nation, as a Senate.\n  The question is, Are we going to continue to allow lawlessness to \noperate at the border? If we don't pass the Cornyn amendment, we will \nbe saying we have no more intention to see that we have lawfulness in \nthe immigration system in the future than we had in the past.\n  I was a Federal prosecutor for almost 15 years. What do you mean you \ncan file a document and Federal investigators can't look at it to \ndetermine whether you committed fraud when you filed it? They are not \ngoing to be looking at people in the millions who are going to file to \ntry to find some innocent mistake. How silly is that? They are not \ngoing to be able to prosecute blatant fraud, frankly, in large numbers. \nBut we don't want them to be incapable of doing so. We don't want to \nset a policy that would prohibit criminal investigators of the United \nStates\n\n[[Page S5141]]\n\nto examine an application for amnesty under this bill and not be able \nto prosecute, if it has fundamental fraudulent statements in it, or \neven be able to use it to build some larger investigation that may \nrelate to coyotes or organizing rings. That is what we are most likely \nto come up with, in my experience.\n  Most likely they will be investigating rings of illegal aliens who \nhave used false identification or come across the border illegally. And \nyou are trying to put that together, and you go back and look at these \napplications which will be critical in establishing that case. They are \nbarred from doing that. This is really a big deal because one of the \nweaknesses I have seen in our whole approach to immigration and, \nfrankly, other issues is that we as a nation are becoming so soft that \nwe are incapable of drawing a line anywhere. We are incapable of \ndrawing a line anywhere. So the proponents of this legislation are \nsaying it is somehow wrong that we could hold people to account if they \nfile an application to become a beneficiary of amnesty. We cannot even \ninvestigate that and prosecute them, or prosecute other people who \nbrought them in illegally in some sort of conspiracy, and deny the \ninvestigators that.\n\n  I thank the Senator from Texas, who is a former attorney general and \na former justice on the Texas Supreme Court. We should listen to him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back our time. I \nthink all time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 30 seconds.\n  Mr. CORNYN. We will yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Wyoming (Mr. Enzi).\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have an amendment, and I think it is \nthat of our friend and colleague from New Mexico. So we want to let our \ncolleagues know there is 40 minutes on this, and we expect to have a \nrollcall vote on this next amendment, just for the awareness of our \ncolleagues at this time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4131\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4131 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4131.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To limit the total number of aliens, including spouses and \n children, granted employment-based legal permanent resident status to \n                    650,000 during any fiscal year)\n\n       On page 316, strike lines 1 through 5, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(2) Visas for spouses and children.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph (B), \n     immigrant visas issued on or after October 1, 2004, to \n     spouses and children of employment-based immigrants shall not \n     be counted against the numerical limitation set forth in \n     paragraph (1).\n       ``(B) Numerical limitation.--The total number of visas \n     issued under paragraph (1)(A) and paragraph (2), excluding \n     such visas issued to aliens pursuant to section 245B or \n     section 245C of the Immigration and Nationality Act, may not \n     exceed 650,000 during any fiscal year.\n       ``(C) Construction.--Nothing in this paragraph may be \n     construed to modify the requirement set out in 245B(a)(1)(I) \n     or 245C(i)(2)(A) that prohibit an alien from receiving an \n     adjustment of status to that of a legal permanent resident \n     prior to the consideration of all applications filed under \n     section 201, 202, or 203 before the date of enactment of \n     section 245B and 245C.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the purpose of my amendment is to put \nsome type of limits on the number of new legal permanent residents we \napprove each year in this country, and that is the question. It is sort \nof a philosophical question and a practical question: Should we limit \nthis number or should we leave it unlimited as the current bill \nprovides?\n  We have two large categories under which we approve new legal \npermanent residents in this country. Let me put one chart up here to \nshow these two categories.\n  One is called family preference. That is essentially where if a \nperson is already a legal resident in the United States and wants to \nbring in family members, that is family reunification, and we think \nthat is a good thing and we provide in the law so that can occur. Each \nyear, there can be 480,000 people who gain legal permanent residency in \nour country under that proposal, and that is right here in the bottom \nhalf of this chart.\n  The other main category we use for establishing legal permanent \nresidency is what we call employment-based, and that is where an \nemployer essentially brings someone to this country to work, along with \ntheir family. We have always had a limit on that. The limit in the law \ntoday is 140,000.\n  Let me go through some of the history of where we have been on this \nissue.\n  In the law that is applicable today, we allow 140,000 legal permanent \nresidents to be approved each year under the employment-based system. \nThe bill Senator Kennedy and Senator McCain proposed last May, on which \nI compliment them--they put a great deal of work into it--that bill \nsaid, let's increase that number from 140,000 to 290,000, and I think \nthat makes some good sense. The 290,000 was to include the workers and \ntheir families, just as current law was to include the workers and \ntheir accompanying families.\n  Then, 2 months ago, when the Judiciary Committee began its \ndeliberations, the chairman presented his chairman's mark, and it said: \nOK, the 290,000 is a good number, but let's only apply it to workers, \nand then any accompanying family will be extra and not count. So on \nthis chart, you can see that this area at the top is the estimated \nnumber of family that might actually come to the country.\n  Now, the estimate is that there would be 1.2 family members \naccompanying each worker, and that estimate came from the Congressional \nResearch Service. They said they didn't\n\n[[Page S5142]]\n\nreally know because it is a very different mix of people we would have \nimmigrating into this country under this legislation than under current \nlaw. But historically, it has been 1.2 people per employee, so let's \njust assume that, and that gets you up to 638,000, was the \nCongressional Research Service's estimate of the number of employment-\nbased visas that would be offered under Senator Specter's chairman's \nmark in the Judiciary Committee.\n  Well, then, of course, we had some additional deliberations here, and \nwe now have the Hagel-Martinez bill. The Hagel-Martinez bill said the \n290,000 figure is wrong; let's go to 450,000. And of course the \nCongressional Research Service said, OK, let's make the same \ncalculation here: 1.2 family members will accompany each of those \n450,000 workers, so you add those in and that gets you to 990,000. That \nis for the first 10 years. After the first 10 years, this legislation \ncalls for that number to drop back down.\n  At this point, let me pause and make a point about this assumption \nwhich is built in here. Let me show one other chart. This is a very \ndifferent group of immigrants we are approving to come into the country \nunder this legislation than is currently approved under existing law. \nIf, in fact, there are more family members who accompany these workers, \nthen these numbers go up pretty dramatically. If, for example, instead \nof 1.2 people--a spouse and two-tenths of a child--coming in with each \nworker you had a spouse and 1 child coming in with each worker, then it \nis 1,350,000. If, in fact, there were 2 children, the spouse and 2 \nchildren, it would be 1.8 million people under the assumptions that are \nbuilt into this legislation.\n  So all I am saying is, we don't know. Under the legislation pending, \nwe don't know whether there are going to be 500,000 employment-based \nvisas issued or a million employment-based visas issued for legal \npermanent residency or 1.5 million. I think we ought to fix that. My \namendment says, let's pick a number.\n  Let's go back to this other chart, and I will show you how we came up \nwith the specific number in the amendment. The number in the amendment \ntries to be a rounded-off number from what the Judiciary Committee \nstarted with and says, look, if they had kept a cap in the Judiciary \nCommittee, as I believe they should have--we have had a cap in this \ncountry, a cap on the number of legal permanent residents \nhistorically--if we kept a cap, then it should be about 650,000. That \nis the estimate we came up with.\n  Some people say that is a very high number. That is a high number. \nThat is over four times what we currently permit. It is more than twice \nwhat Senators Kennedy and McCain recommended in their legislation, the \nMcCain-Kennedy bill or Kennedy-McCain bill. We have tried to be \ngenerous in this and say we should have a lot of new immigrants \ntransferring over to legal permanent status, but we should have some \nlimit on those.\n  The real question for each Senator is going to be whether you agree \nthere ought to be a cap. Do you agree there ought to be a limit? I \nbelieve very strongly we should have a limit. I believe the limit we \nhave chosen here is a generous one. To leave this bill with no cap at \nall would be a mistake. To send this bill out of the Senate without \nknowing whether we are increasing the legal permanent residents under \nthe employment-based system 4 times or 8 times or 12 times, which is \nvery possible, I think would be a very big mistake. So we need to get \nsome certainty into this. We need to try to be somewhat prudent in what \nwe are doing.\n  Let me just mention one other thing. Mr. President, how much time \nremains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve minutes, twenty seconds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me just mention that this cap I am \ntrying to put on is just for one of the categories vailable for people \nwho want to become legal permanent residents, and I need to underscore \nthat.\n  There is still the opportunity to become a legal permanent resident \nas part of this family preference category. That is 480,000 per year, \nand we are not in any way affecting that with my amendment. There is \nstill the opportunity, if you are already here in this country and you \nhave been here 2 years under this legislation and you are undocumented, \nyou can go through the earned legalization provisions in the bill and \nbecome a legal permanent resident. We are not in any way affecting any \nof that or trying to limit that. If you are an agricultural worker, \nthere are 1.5 million blue card agricultural workers who are provided \nwith an opportunity to become legal permanent residents in this bill, \nbut we are not in any way affecting that. There are various categories \nin the bill for highly skilled workers who are able to become legal \npermanent residents without being subject to any numerical cap. I have \nsupported those provisions. I am not suggesting we put a cap on those \nprovisions. These are highly skilled workers, in many cases people \ninvolved in science and engineering and other skills that are important \nto our economy.\n  Of course, there is provided in the bill an additional estimated \n141,000 visas which have been recaptured from the last 5 years because \nthey were unused. We are not doing anything to affect that. That is \nfine. I have no problem with that.\n\n  All we are saying is that this large category that we call \nemployment-based legal permanent residents, we should have an annual \nlimit on that. We have had one for over 100 years. We have always \nlimited that. Every country in the world limits that. We should not be \nthe only exception in the world to this general, prudent rule as I see \nit.\n  We can argue about exactly what the right limit ought to be, but I \ndon't think we should give up on having any cap at all, and that, \nunfortunately, is what the present bill provides.\n  How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 9 minutes and 50 seconds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I see my colleague from Arizona wishes to speak. I \nyield the floor and reserve my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time in opposition?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask that I be allowed 5 minutes in \nopposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise, obviously, in strong opposition to \nthe amendment. The Senator from New Mexico just made my arguments for \nme. He wants us to be like other countries in the world--maybe France, \nmaybe Germany, maybe those countries where there has been no \nassimilation, no ability to become part of the society and therefore \nthey have ended up with serious situations--riots, car burnings. It is \nclear he wants to be like other countries in the world.\n  He also made my argument in that he pointed out there are lots of \nways for highly skilled workers, highly educated people to come in. \nThere is virtually no restraint on them. So he is going to focus on the \nlower skilled workers. Those are the ones on whom we are going to put \nthe cap. Right.\n  The overwhelming number of people who have come to this country have \nstarted out as low-skilled workers, I remind my colleague from New \nMexico, and have worked their way up the economic ladder. If you are \nrich and educated and highly skilled, come on in. There is no problem \nwith you coming to the United States of America. But if you are low \nskilled, we are going to make sure that not only you but your children \nare not admitted.\n  My parents had three children. I am glad we didn't have that kind of \nproposal for my family--either I or my sister or my brother may have \nstayed someplace else, if my parents were immigrants. This is against \nfamily. This is against everything that America stands for.\n  I point out to my colleagues, this is just one in a series of \namendments that basically would restrict people's ability to come to \nthis country to not only work but also, over time, raise families and \nbecome part of our society. The Bingaman amendment clearly \ndiscriminates against people who are low skilled. He wants us to be \nlike every other country in the world. I tell the Senator from New \nMexico, I don't want America to be like every other country in the \nworld. He made my argument against his own amendment. I don't want us \nto be like that.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I believe I have the floor. If the Senator \nfrom\n\n[[Page S5143]]\n\nNew Mexico--by the way, this amendment is opposed by the Chamber of \nCommerce and the majority of the unions and certainly by every major \nHispanic and immigrant group in the United States of America. The \nSenator from New Mexico may prevail. But lately these amendments have, \nobviously--they have a tenor and an effect that I don't think is \nhealthy for this country and I don't think is good for America.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for just a \nmoment, I yield my 1 hour postcloture to the Senator from Pennsylvania, \nMr. Specter.\n  I thank my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The Senator from \nNew Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I was seeking recognition to ask the \nSenator from Arizona--he says this is unfair to low-income, low-skilled \nworkers because we are putting a cap of 650,000 on this employment \nbase. His proposal, the McCain-Kennedy bill, limited it. It had a cap \nof 290,000. I am proposing more than twice the admissions under the \nemployment-based system than his proposal had. I don't understand why \nmine is unfair to anybody whereas his 290,000 was appropriate. He was \nproposing 290,000 as a limit on the number of people who could \ntransition to legal permanent status, and that is when the guest worker \nprogram was being proposed at 400,000 per year. We have now reduced the \nguest worker program to 200,000 per year, and I am saying legal \npermanent residents should not exceed 650,000 per year under the \nemployment-based system, in addition to the family preference, in \naddition to all the other ways that you can become a legal permanent \nresident. So I don't think this is that unfair. It is more than twice \nwhat he and Senator Kennedy proposed and more than four times the \ncurrent law.\n  But it does impose some cap. I understand there are people, \nparticularly inside the beltway, who do not want any cap. A lot of the \nimmigrant groups have indicated very clearly they are opposed to any \ncap, any limit in this category. Of course, the Chamber of Commerce is \nopposed to any limit in this category. They would prefer to be able to \nbring in anybody without limit. I think that is not a responsible \ncourse, and for that reason I have offered this amendment.\n  I reserve my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The answer is very simple, I say to the Senator. We had \none figure when we came out of committee and then we had the Martinez \nlegislation which forced individuals to go on back. We want to make \nsure the people who have been working here from 2 to 5 years would be \nable to go back and then come back in employment. So we increase that.\n  I will just continue----\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I just want to make another point. Here is the \nlegislation, the immigration act. It points out where the priorities \nfor the green cards are. If the Senator offered that amendment and had \na fair distribution of the green cards, I would support him. But he \ndoes not. Under this he gives the priority to workers, aliens with \nextraordinary ability. That is No. 1. Outstanding professors and \nresearchers, they will get their green cards; certain multinational \nexecutives and managers, they are going to get their green cards; \naliens who are members of professions, they are going to get their \ngreen cards; skilled workers and professionals, they will get their \ngreen cards. But the people we have talked about, to try to make this \nkind of balance, the ones who have been coming across the border, the \nones for whom we are trying to get a legal system so they can come \nthrough as guest workers, under this they are the ones who will be left \nout.\n  Fair ought to be fair. We have tried to work with the Senator from \nNew Mexico to get a fair distribution so people will be treated fairly, \nand we have not gotten it. This is why we have this dilemma.\n  If you wanted to try to work with us to try to get a fair \ndistribution--but that has not been the case. We tried to do that. As a \nresult, the point the Senator from Arizona makes has credit.\n  I will withhold our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time? The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, can I respond? First, on the last point \nSenator Kennedy makes about fair distribution, I am accepting the \ndistribution that is in the Hagel-Martinez legislation, the \ndistribution that was in the chairman's mark, the distribution that was \nin the McCain-Kennedy bill. I am not changing that in any respect. I am \nnot proposing to make any change in that. Whatever the distribution was \nthat they thought was appropriate, that is exactly what I accept. My \namendment doesn't affect that.\n  Let me make this other point because Senator Kennedy made a point \nthat somehow or other the Hagel-Martinez legislation caused the need \nfor no cap in this area, and for the very large number we are, in my \namendment, excluding--we are saying, in calculating this 650,000, we \nare excluding such visas as are issued to anyone under this 245-B and -\nC program, which is all of those people who are going to come in under \nthis deferred mandatory departure system, the people who have been here \nat least 2 years but not a full 5 years, or not more than 5 years.\n  We are saying let's not count those people. Those folks are home \nfree. Anyone who has been here over 2 years is home free. They are on \ntheir way to legal permanent status and I have supported that aspect of \nthe bill and I continue to support that aspect of the bill.\n  All I am saying is that once you exclude that group and say, OK, they \nare home free, then you still have the question: How many new \nemployment-based legal permanent residents are we going to admit each \nyear? Senator McCain, Senator Kennedy said it ought to be 290,000. I am \nsaying let's make it 650,000, but let's put on a cap. Let's not leave \nit the way the bill now stands, which is totally uncontrolled.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator controls 5 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will reserve my time at this point.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will just take a minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The problem is that there is a limitation with the cap. \nUnder the existing legislation the children and the wives were not \ncounted. You are counting them now. The way the law works is going to \nbe the squeeze. That is the effect. If the Senator wanted to--we tried \nto work this out. The Senator can say we are not changing anything, \nbut, yes, we are changing it. We are changing it because you are moving \nnumbers around. People will be able to come into this country. There \nwill be a job out there, a person will be able to apply for it and come \nin here, but they can't get the green card because we only have a \ncertain number of green cards. So that person will not be able to get \nthe green card. So they will never be able to make an application for \npermanent residency. That is the effect of it.\n  If the Senator wanted to work with us--which we indicated we were \ngoing to--and put in that kind of cap and work this around so we could \nstill maintain that aspect in the legislation, we were glad to do it. \nBut once you have that limitation which is in effect now--is in effect \nnow--this skews this whole process in terms of green card and \nnormalization to the highest skilled individual and says to those \npeople we have been trying to deal with--there is pressure on the \nborder. We spend an enormous amount of time with guest workers saying: \nYou are going to be treated with respect, no Braceros. You are going to \nwork hard for 4 years, and there is going to be a green card out there, \nand you can work 5 more years, work hard, play by the rules, pay your \ntaxes, and get citizenship.\n  Can the Senator give us assurance that under his proposal someone who \ncomes as a guest worker and works 4 years is going to be able to get \nthe green card and go for citizenship?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am glad to respond. I can't give \nassurance of that. But I can say they are much more likely to get the \ngreen card under my proposal than they were under McCain-Kennedy. \nMcCain-Kennedy\n\n[[Page S5144]]\n\ncontemplated 400,000 guest workers every year coming in and said the \ntotal number of green cards we are going to issue to these people is \n290,000, including family.\n  What I am saying is, we should increase that to 650,000, including \nfamily, since we have half as many guest workers coming in each year \nunder the bill that we have agreed to on the Senate floor.\n  I think my proposal, frankly, is much more generous in giving green \ncards to people who have come here legally than was McCain-Kennedy. It \nis more than twice as generous. It is more than four times as generous \nas current law. But I am saying we ought to have some cap. We should \nnot just leave it uncapped entirely.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 5 minutes 35 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time? The Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I think this has been a very good debate. \nWhy is the Chamber opposed? Why are the groups backing the bill \nopposed? Do they want just anybody and everybody? Some probably do. I \ndon't believe that is what motivates the authors of the bill.\n  We are trying to marry up needs, and the numbers we are picking do \nchange because of the politics and because of projected needs.\n  What I would say to my good friend from New Mexico is, if you think \nyou are helping, you are not. I am not questioning your motives. I will \nnever question the motive of any Senator who votes differently than I \ndo because they are all intelligent people, and I don't claim to know \nmore about any particular area than any other of my colleagues. But \nwhat we are doing is trying to create order out of chaos because we \nlive in a chaotic world when it comes to immigration. The numbers \nchange every time the bill changes.\n  Hagel and Martinez was a new proposal, a new idea that broke people \ninto different groups. The 2-to-5 year group of people was treated \ndifferently. Senator Bingaman was right, we tried to exclude that. \nWhether it is 290,000 or 600,000--whatever, what I don't want to do is \nartificially deny my country the ability to assimilate hard-working \npeople I think we need.\n  The fundamental disagreement between me and the Heritage Foundation \nand Senator Bingaman is I believe that immigration is going to be \nregulated by the needs of our economy. When our economy gets to the \npoint that we can't tolerate more people, the numbers are going to \nchange. The Heritage Foundation assumed escalations in numbers apart \nfrom supply and demand. To my good friend from New Mexico, the 11 \nmillion to 12 million--whatever number it is--have already been \nassimilated into our workforce without damage to our workforce because \nwe have historically low unemployment, and the economy is humming, from \na Republican sound bite point of view. This is about as good as it will \never get.\n  When you change the formula, when you introduce the family element of \nhaving to choose between family status and work status in a different \nkind of way than the base bill, then you are going to create a chaotic \npolitical event, a chaotic assimilation event.\n  What I am trying to urge my colleagues to do is let us not create \ndisorder in a way that just doesn't reflect what we want to be as a \nsociety. We need the workers. I think we need more than 290,000. But \nwhen you start looking at counting the children and family members and \nthey are not workers, you are hurting our business community, and you \nare putting a burden down the road on people. That just really makes me \nfeel uncomfortable.\n  I respect Senator Bingaman's approach to this problem. He has limited \nthe number of people that can come in. I fundamentally disagree with \nhim. I think 5 years from now we are going to need more people, not \nless. Japan is our model in this regard. The Japanese demographics have \nchanged. There are more older people there than younger people. They \nhave a closed society. They don't assimilate people from outside their \nculture, and their gross domestic product has slowed down. Their \nworkforce needs are being unmet.\n  Whatever number we pick--and we can all talk about what the right \nnumber is--to make this change at this stage in the proceedings to \nintroduce family status versus work status is a new concept, something \nwe haven't all thought about and worked through before. That does more \nharm than good.\n  I hope we can march forward, work with the numbers based on what we \nthink the economic needs of the country will be in a way that is fair \nto people.\n  We have changed the bill fundamentally from Hagel-Martinez. We are \ntrying to accommodate business needs; we are trying to accommodate the \nneeds of our society in terms of people violating the law.\n  But this idea that we are going to flood America with people who \ncan't add value to America, my colleagues, is contrary to what this \nbill is about.\n  If you come here under this bill, whether you are a future flow or \nyou are with the 11 million, you will have to prove to us over time \nthat you are worthy of staying here. You will have to earn your way \ninto working in this country and staying in this country. You are not \ngetting anything for free. As a matter of fact, the future flow people \nand the 11 million people are going to be asked to do more than any \ngeneration that has ever come to this country.\n  I think there is a point in time where we need to stop and try to \nhave assimilation rules that bring about order, not chaos.\n  I hope that we will reject this attempt to change the bill in the \neleventh hour because it will create political and economic chaos.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have great respect for the Senator from \nSouth Carolina. But when he says to the Senator from New Mexico that \nyou think you are helping and you are not, I come down on the other \nside. I am one of those people who has not decided how I am going to \nvote on this final bill. But this will help make up my mind. If there \nare no caps, that would have significant bearing on how I might vote on \nfinal passage.\n  I have great respect for those who have managed this bill. I think \nthis bill has been improved substantially since it came to the floor. \nWe have actually gone through a legislative process for once around \nhere. For the first time in a long time, we are actually legislating. \nThis bill has been improved as a result.\n  The provisions to strengthen and protect the border have been \ndramatically improved.\n  The credibility of the plan to deal with the 11 million or 12 million \nillegal immigrants that are already here has been substantially \nimproved. This bill is still very imperfect.\n  I want to conclude by saying that the Senator from New Mexico is I \nthink casting a lifeline out to sponsors of this bill. If this bill has \nno caps, I think you will find a strong public reaction against this \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, once again Senator Bingaman is correct \nand has a very, very important amendment.\n  My staff was the first to alert the country to the huge numbers that \nare involved in this bill and the extraordinary increases in legal \nimmigration that will occur. We ran the numbers also.\n  Senator Bingaman's previous amendment helps fix some of those \nproblems. This one will further help.\n  Under current law for employment-based green cards, 140,000 people \nare allowed in the country each year, and spouses and children count \nagainst that 140,000. Under the bill that is on the floor today, that \nnumber goes to 450,000, and spouses and children do not count. \nUtilizing the numbers of the Congressional Research Service, as the\n\n[[Page S5145]]\n\nSenator said, 1.2 children and a spouse per worker coming in, that \nwould total 990,000 under this simple provision alone. It goes from \n140,000 to 990,000. It could be more that come in under the spouse and \nfamily provisions. Let's just say go to 650,000. That is about four \ntimes the current rate.\n  How reasonable is that? I have not seen any economist, I have not \nseen hearings in which we have ever had official testimony that \nincreasing by fivefold or sixfold the amount of legal immigration in \nthis country is the right approach to take. So we don't have a \nnecessary basis to assert this.\n  There is not really a tenor here. It is not a question of evocative, \nemotional feelings. It is a question of what does this bill do. It is \nfatally flawed, and the Senator is correct.\n  I support his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains on the two sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 1 minute 56 \nseconds, the Senator from Massachusetts has 7 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just so that our colleagues and friends \nunderstand exactly what we have done over the course of the development \nof this legislation, we have increased dramatically opportunities for \nhigh-skilled people to come here to the United States, probably two or \nthree times, and the best estimate is about 600,000. That has been \nincreased dramatically.\n  Under the basic immigration law, the people who get the first crack \nat the green card--what is the green card? The green card is the path \ntowards citizenship. That really is key in terms of their future and \ntheir family's future.\n  Under existing law, of all the green cards that are going to be \navailable, 70 percent of those are going to go to the high skills and \nonly 30 percent to what I call the low skills.\n  We have recognized in the development of the legislation the pressure \nthat is on the border, people coming across the border illegally, the \npressure that is on companies that need the unskilled individuals to \nwork in American industry for jobs that virtually no Americans will \ntake. So we set up the process. They have to go out and ask. Americans \nhave to advertise for those jobs and indicate what the pay will be. If \nthey can't get it, they are able to bring in a foreign worker.\n  In this legislation, since we have found that farm workers have been \nso exploited over the period of the past we have given the assurance \nthat we are going to have a tamper-proof card. They will able to come \nhere and be able to be treated with respect, with decent wages and \ndecent working conditions.\n  We have put into effect a program which will enable enforcement in \nthe legislation for employers. We know that there are demands for these \nlow-skill workers. That is what we have done. That is the pressure at \nthe border--for people who want to come here and be part of the \nAmerican dream and provide for their family.\n  We said to the lower-skilled individuals that we are going to treat \nyou the same as the higher-skilled individuals because we believe in \nequity and fairness. We value the work of lower-skilled persons. We \nvalue the work of minimum-wage workers as we do the presidents of \nuniversities. That is an essential part of our country and our system. \nThey provide indispensable work.\n  We said to them, Look, you come to the United States as a temporary \nworker; you work hard for 4 years. Then you have the opportunity to get \na green card; 5 years later, if you pay your taxes and behave yourself, \nyou can earn your citizenship. But they have to be able to earn the \ngreen card.\n  With the numbers that have been increased over the course of the \ndebate on McCain-Kennedy, the effect of this is going to eliminate the \npossibility also of those low-income people to be able to obtain a \ngreen card over the time that they are here in the 6-year period.\n  That is effectively capping what you do. We tried to work out with \nthe Senator from New Mexico a way to kind of deal with this disparity \nso we could have a fair distribution. We haven't been able to do that. \nBut what we have done effectively is a dramatic alteration and change \nin this bill. At the end of the day there will not be the opportunity \nnor will we be able to represent the guest workers when they come to \nthe United States. After 6 years, you have no alternative but to return \nhome.\n\n  I know that is not the intention of the Senator from New Mexico. But \nthat is the effect of his amendment on this legislation.\n  As I said to the Senator from New Mexico, we tried over the course of \nyesterday to say, OK, I understand the appeal of trying to get a \ndefinitive number of people, including children. It always involves \nsome give-and-take. Some families have larger numbers of children than \nothers, and we have always tried to be responsive to these family \nneeds. We were trying to work out a process so that would not happen.\n  The Senator from New Mexico points out that there is a difference in \nthe underlying bill. Our underlying bill was changed both in the \nJudiciary Committee and on the floor. One of the principal reasons it \nchanged on the floor is because we took the Martinez-Hagel amendment \nthat said we are going to treat people who are here 5 years differently \nthan we are going to treat the people that are here longer. Those who \nare going to be here only for 2 years are going to be deported. But \nthey will know there is a guest worker program out there. If they want \nto go out and become a part of a guest worker program, they can find \nways to be able to do it, play by the rules and be able to probably \nfind a way to come back in and do it legally.\n  Those who are here between 2 and 5 years are going to have to be \ncertain of the other requirements. They will have to go back to the \nport of entry and come back in--and they are treated differently.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous consent that \nthe time not be charged.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I regret being absent for part of this \ndebate on the issue, but the Judiciary Committee has been meeting in a \nrather heated session to decide what to do about getting information \nfrom the telephone companies on the NSA program. I want to comment very \nbriefly in opposition to the amendment by the Senator from New Mexico.\n  This amendment will substantially limit the ability of members of a \nfamily to accompany those who come into the United States and take jobs \nwhere they will be productive. I believe having family present is a \nvery high value. This amendment, in putting a cap on, leaving no \nflexibility for family members to accompany the immigrant, is just \nbasically a bad idea.\n  We have sufficient room to accommodate the immigrants who are \npermitted to come in under the guest worker program, and accommodating \nthe guest worker ought to include their family. They ought not to be \nseparated from their family. We ought not to have a statute on this \nimportant subject which has that very undesirable family result.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand all the time has expired. We \nask for the yeas and nays on the Bingaman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 1 minute 54 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Excuse me. I apologize.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Let me respond to that point which was just made by the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee. There is nothing in my amendment that limits \nthe ability of families to accompany workers. All my amendment does is \nto say there should be a cap on the total number of workers with \naccompanying family, just as there is today, just as there was under \nthe McCain-Kennedy proposal. We are saying there should be some limit. \nIt should not be open-ended, as the current bill pending on the Senate \nfloor provides.\n\n[[Page S5146]]\n\n  We are saying this limit should be 650,000. Now, why did we choose \nthat? Because that is what the Congressional Research Service says they \nestimated would actually be happening under Chairman Specter's proposed \nmark to the Judiciary Committee when they started. To do something \nother than what we are proposing in this amendment is to leave it \ntotally unknown as to how many people we are going to have coming in \nunder this employment-based legal permanent residency program, how many \ngreen cards we are going to be giving out. It could be 500,000. It \ncould be 1 million. It could be 1.5 million. This is every year I am \ntalking about. That is not an acceptable arrangement.\n  Now, I want to make clear this one point, which I said before; that \nis, this amendment in no way limits the number of people who can come \nin and become legal permanent residents under the family preference. \nThat is 480,000. It does not affect the number of people who can have \ntheir situation, their status changed under the undocumented earned \nlegalization provisions. That is 11 or 12 million. It is left alone. It \ndoes not affect the 1.5 million blue card agricultural workers. It does \nnot affect the shortage occupation groups and other high-skilled \nworkers. It does not affect the 141,000 visas that we are bringing back \nfrom the last 5 years.\n  This amendment will improve the bill. It is not an effort to \nundermine the bill. It is an effort to improve the bill. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Feingold \namendment and debate precede the Sessions amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, so that our colleagues will know the \nschedule, Senator Byrd has asked to speak to the body following this \nvote on his 69th wedding anniversary. He will be recognized for that \npurpose.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator. I want to \ndo that at a time that will accommodate him and the Senate. So if the \nSenator would let me know right now, if he might, when might be the \nbest time to accommodate him and the Senate.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia. We will see if we can find a more convenient time.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Bingaman amendment.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Wyoming (Mr. Enzi).\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, we are making progress. I see the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin on his feet. He has an amendment. We have two amendments \nfollowing that. Then, hopefully, we will be ready for final passage. I \nunderstand we have an hour of time evenly divided.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I hope it will be shorter, but it \ndepends on the response.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4083\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4083.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4083.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To strike the provision prohibiting a court from staying the \n             removal of an alien in certain circumstances)\n\n       On page 167, strike lines 17 through 20.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment will ensure that asylum \nseekers, victims of trafficking, and other immigrants are able to \nsecure meaningful judicial review of removal orders. It would strike \nfrom the bill a provision that would have the really absurd result of \nmaking it harder in many cases for an immigrant to get a temporary stay \nof removal pending appeal than to actually win on the merits of the \ncase.\n  Before I go further, I thank Senator Brownback for cosponsoring this \namendment. He has been tireless in his efforts to help asylum-seekers \nand trafficking victims, and I am very pleased that we could work \ntogether on a bipartisan basis on this effort.\n  Under section 227(c) of the bill, a court cannot grant a temporary \nstay of removal pending appeal to an asylum applicant or other \nindividual unless the immigrant proves by clear and convincing evidence \nthat the order is prohibited as a matter of law. That, as we all know, \nis an extremely difficult standard to satisfy, particularly in the \npreliminary stage of an appeal. It is so difficult that the Chicago Bar \nAssociation called this provision a ``potentially devastating threat to \ndue process.''\n  This draconian provision could have a particularly harmful effect on \nasylum-seekers. It could effectively deny all judicial review to many \nasylum applicants who might otherwise have successful appeals by \nallowing them to be sent back to countries where they can face \npersecution or even death before a Federal court can even rule on their \ncases.\n  Section 227(c) would overturn the decisions of seven different courts \nof appeal that have determined that the Immigration and Nationality Act \ndoes not currently require immigrants to meet the very high ``clear and \nconvincing evidence'' standard for temporary stays of removal pending \nappeal. I will explain in a bit more detail, as these courts already \nhave, why this very stringent standard would be such bad policy.\n  First of all, as I have said, in many cases this provision would \nresult in an immigrant having to meet a higher standard of review to \nget a temporary stay of removal than to prevail on the merits of it. \nFederal courts review legal issues in asylum and other immigration \ncases de novo, and they review issues, such as credibility questions in \nasylum cases, using a lower, ``substantial evidence'' standard. These \nstandards are nowhere near as difficult to\n\n[[Page S5147]]\n\nsatisfy as a ``clear and convincing evidence'' standard that the \ndecision ``prohibited as a matter of law.'' Indeed, courts of appeal \nhave pointed out that the only individuals who could satisfy such a \nhigh standard would be U.S. citizens and individuals who hold visas of \n``unquestioned validity.''\n  I will read a quick passage from a decision of the First Circuit \nCourt of Appeals that I think goes right to the heart of the issue:\n\n       Perhaps most important, we recognize that extending [the] \n     stringent clear and convincing evidence standard to stays \n     pending appeal . . . would result in a peculiar situation in \n     which adjudicating a stay request would necessitate full \n     deliberation on the merits of the underlying case and, in the \n     bargain, require the alien to carry a burden of proof higher \n     than she would have to carry on the merits. This Kafkaesque \n     design is counterintuitive.\n\n  Let's pause for a moment to consider that--``this Kafkaesque design \nis counterintuitive.'' A panel of the First Circuit Court of Appeals, \nin a decision written by a judge appointed by President Reagan, has \ncalled the very provision that is in the bill ``Kafkaesque.'' Surely, \nthe Senate does not want to include such an extreme provision in this \nbill.\n  Even in situations where the issue on appeal is subject to a very \ndeferential standard of review, it makes no sense to require an \nimmigrant to meet the stringent ``clear and convincing evidence'' \nstandard of review at such a preliminary stage of the case. As one \ncourt has pointed out, the appellant may not even have obtained a copy \nof the administrative record that early in the case. How can appellants \nprove by clear and convincing evidence that they will win their appeal \nwhen they may not even have a copy of the administrative record?\n  Kafkaesque, indeed.\n  This standard would also be out of line with analogous situations in \nother civil cases. Typically, when an appellant seeks temporary relief \nat the beginning of a case, the goal, as many of us know, is to \npreserve the factual situation for the duration of the appeal, and the \ngoal of that is to ensure that the ultimate relief, if granted, will \nstill be meaningful. That is why many courts of appeals reviewing \nremoval orders rely on the same standard of review that applies to \nrequests for temporary restraining orders in civil litigation. That \ntest is well known to so many who have studied the law. They apply a \nfour-part test that evaluates the likelihood of success on the merits: \nwhether there will be irreparable injury if a stay is denied; whether \nthere will be a substantial injury to the party opposing a stay if one \nis issued; and the fourth criterion, the public interest. This flexible \nstandard allows a court to assess whether a stay is needed early in the \ncase without having to delve into the detail required to determine the \nfinal outcome.\n  But if this provision were to become law, the entire case would have \nto be litigated in full twice--once to meet the requirements for a stay \nof removal and then again on the merits. At least in some courts of \nappeals, that would mean the case would first have to be presented to a \nmotions panel on the stay application and then again before the merits \npanel. As the American Bar Association has argued in urging the Senate \nto reject this provision, such a duplicative process would be a \nsignificant waste of resources, particularly at a time when the \nimmigration caseload of the Federal courts is growing.\n  I wish to speak for a moment about the individuals who would most \nlikely be harmed by this new provision, and they are, of course, asylum \nseekers.\n  As one Federal court has explained, imposing this new stringent \nstandard ``would mean that `thousands of asylum seekers who fled their \nnative lands based on well-founded fears of persecution will be forced \nto return to that danger under the fiction that they will be safe while \nwaiting the slow wheels of American justice to grind to a halt.'''\n  Similarly, Judge Easterbrook of the Seventh Circuit noted that stays \npending appeal ``remain vital when the alien seeks asylum or contends \nhe would be subject to torture if returned. The ability to come back to \nthe United States would not be worth much if the alien has been maimed \nor murdered in the interim. Yet under [the clear and convincing \nevidence standard] . . . an alien who is likely to prevail in this \ncourt, and likely to face serious injury or death if removed, is not \nentitled to remain in this Nation while the court resolves the \ndispute.'' Just to give that example.\n  The stakes are high. This provision has the potential to be \ndevastating for asylum seekers; so devastating, in fact, that the \nprovision was rejected by Congress just last year when it was taken out \nof the REAL ID Act in the conference process, and it is not even \nincluded in the current House bill. I hope the Senate will support my \namendment to strike this troubling provision from the bill.\n  Let me put a personal face on this debate. I received earlier this \nweek a letter from the National Network to End Violence Against \nImmigrant Women. This is a very compelling letter, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                     May 22, 2006.\n     Re Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 [Hagel-\n         Martinez compromise] (S. 2611), Biden Amendment 4077 \n         (amends section 403(a)(1)), and Feingold Amendment 4083 \n         (amends section 227[c]).\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the National Network to End \n     Violence Against Immigrant Women, we write to urge you to \n     preserve access to longstanding, life-saving legal \n     protections embodied in the Violence Against Women Act \n     (``VAWA'') for immigrant victims of domestic abuse, sexual \n     assault, or human trafficking. The National Network to End \n     Violence Against Immigrant Women is comprised of over 3,000 \n     professionals nationwide including police, sheriffs, district \n     attorneys, probation officers, prosecutors, health providers, \n     churches, rape crisis centers, domestic violence shelters, \n     mental health professionals, child protective services \n     workers, and immigrant rights' groups. The Network's members \n     are all joined by a common purpose--working towards the \n     eradication of all forms of violence perpetrated against \n     immigrant women and children including domestic abuse, sexual \n     assault, human trafficking, and stalking.\n       The National Network to End Violence Against Immigrant \n     Women urges you to support:\n       (1) Biden Amendment 4077 [amends section 403 (a)(1)]: \n     preserves access to VAWA cancellation of removal (family \n     violence), T visas (trafficking), and U visas (violent \n     crimes); and\n       (2) Feingold Amendment 4083 [amends section 227[c]]: \n     preserves access to judicial stays of removal for immigrants, \n     including victims of violence or persecution, who are \n     appealing their cases to the federal courts.\n       I. S. 2611, section 403(a)(l) endangers thousands of \n     immigrant women and children by cutting off victims of \n     domestic abuse, sexual assault, or human trafficking from the \n     VAWA immigration remedies created by Congress in 1994 and \n     2000.\n       S. 2611, section 403(a)(1) adds a new subsection to the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (``INA''), 218A(i), which \n     would bar individuals who enter or remain in the U.S. without \n     authorization from obtaining cancellation of removal, \n     voluntary departure, or nonimmigrant status for 10 years. \n     Section 218A(i) does not contain an exception for victims of \n     domestic abuse, sexual assault, or human trafficking who \n     qualify for VAWA cancellation of removal (family violence), T \n     visas (human trafficking), or V visas (violent crimes). \n     Without a specific amendment to exempt these victims, section \n     403(a)(1) will undo over a decade of progress in fighting \n     domestic abuse, sexual assault, and human trafficking started \n     with the enactment of the Violence Against Women Act \n     (``VAWA'') in 1994.\n       Since passing VAWA 1994, Congress has continually \n     reaffirmed the nation's commitment to granting special \n     humanitarian relief to immigrant victims of domestic abuse, \n     sexual assault, or human trafficking. In 2000 Congress \n     created the T visa and V visa in the Victims of Trafficking \n     and Violence Protection Act. As recently as last December, \n     Congress expanded VAWA and trafficking immigration relief in \n     the VAWA Reauthorization Act of 2005. If the Senate does not \n     now carve out a limited exception to S. 2611, section \n     403(a)(1), it will be undercutting the very protections \n     created by Congress in VAWA 1994 and 2000.\n       We, therefore, respectfully urge you to support Biden \n     Amendment 4077 which would carve out a limited exception for \n     victims of family violence, sexual assault, or human \n     trafficking from S. 2611, section 403(a)(1) to ensure they \n     have continued access to VAWA cancellation of removal, T \n     visas, and U visas.\n       II. S. 2611, section 227[c] endangers immigrant women and \n     children who will be deported into the hands of human \n     traffickers, batterers, and persecutors, thereby facing \n     certain harm and possible death.\n       S. 2611, section 227[c] would bar federal courts from \n     staying the deportation of any immigrant with a final removal \n     order unless she shows by ``clear and convincing evidence'' \n     that deportation is prohibited as a matter of law. This \n     heightened standard would make it virtually impossible for \n     most victims of domestic abuse, sexual assault, or human \n     trafficking to obtain stays of deportation while their cases \n     are on appeal to the\n\n[[Page S5148]]\n\n     federal courts. Section 227[c] poses grave risks to many \n     immigrant women and children who, in the absence of a stay of \n     removal, will be deported and delivered into the hands of \n     human traffickers, batterers, and persecutors.\n       Why is preserving access to temporary judicial stays of \n     removal critical for immigrant victims of violence or \n     persecution? Because it is not uncommon for the federal \n     courts to reverse illegal deportation/removal orders that \n     were issued by immigration judges and subsequently affirmed \n     by the Board of Immigration Appeals (``BIA''). For many \n     immigrant women and children, the federal courts are the \n     ultimate protectors of justice, and it is not until their \n     case reaches the federal courts that they are given due \n     process, as required by the Constitution. All immigrants, but \n     especially victims of violence or persecution, need to have \n     continued access to request judicial stays of removal/\n     deportation while their cases are being reviewed by the \n     federal courts. A temporary judicial stay of removal does not \n     allow an immigrant to remain indefinitely in the U.S.; it \n     merely prevents the Department of Homeland Security from \n     deporting her while the federal court reviews her case.\n       Real-life immigrant women who obtained judicial stays of \n     removal during the pendency of their appeals and were \n     ultimately granted immigration relief by the federal courts:\n       Laura Luisa Hernandez endured years of brutal violence at \n     the hands of her husband. He slammed her head against the \n     wall, smashed a fan on her head, savagely beat her, attacked \n     her with a knife, and denied her access to medical care for \n     her injuries. Ms. Hernandez applied for VAWA suspension of \n     deportation, a special form of relief for abused spouses and \n     children that Congress created in VAWA 1994. An immigration \n     judge denied Ms. Hernandez's VAWA suspension of deportation \n     application and ordered her deported. The BIA affirmed the \n     immigration judge's denial of VAWA suspension of application. \n     Ms. Hernandez then appealed the BIA decision to the U.S. \n     Court of Appeals and obtained a temporary stay of deportation \n     while her appeal was being reviewed by the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals. The U.S. Court of Appeals eventually reversed the \n     BIA decision and concluded that she qualified for VAWA \n     suspension of deportation. See Hernandez v. Ashcroft, 345 \n     F.3d 824 (9th Cir. 2003).\n       Lioudmila Krotova and her children Anastasia and Aleksandra \n     fled Russia after they were assaulted by skinheads and their \n     synagogue was stormed. Ms. Krotova reported both attacks to \n     the police, but the police failed to take any meaningful \n     action. After the Krotovas fled Russia, skinheads beat a \n     close family friend to death, and also beat the Krotovas' \n     relative so brutally that they broke his hip. After entering \n     the U.S., Ms. Krotova applied for asylum. An immigration \n     judge denied her application, and the BIA affirmed the \n     judge's decision. Ms. Krotova then appealed to the U.S. Court \n     of Appeals and obtained a temporary stay of removal. The U.S. \n     Court of Appeals eventually reversed the BIA decision and \n     concluded that the harassment, discrimination, and violence \n     experienced by Ms. Krotova on account of her being Jewish \n     compelled the finding that she suffered past persecution. See \n     Krotova v. Gonzales, 416 F.3d 1080 (9th Cir. 2005).\n       Ralitsa Nedkova, a Roma (gypsy) woman from Bulgaria, was \n     brutalized by the police for many years. She was repeatedly \n     arrested, detained, beaten, and threatened with rape by the \n     police for doing nothing wrong other than being Roma. She \n     suffered numerous injuries including cracked ribs as a result \n     of police brutality. She was also brutalized by her ethnic \n     Bulgarian husband who savagely beat her while screaming \n     ``Whore! Gypsy!'' When she was pregnant, he beat and kicked \n     her in the stomach yelling, ``Gypsies don't have a right to \n     have children!'' He beat her so violently that she miscarried \n     in her second trimester. Ms. Nedkova eventually fled for her \n     life and attempted to enter the U.S. She was arrested by \n     immigration authorities and remained in detention for years. \n     While in detention, she applied for withholding of removal. \n     An immigration judge denied her application, and the BIA \n     affirmed the decision. Ms. Nedkova appealed her case to the \n     U.S. Court of Appeals and obtained a temporary stay of \n     removal during the pendency of her appeal. The U.S. Court of \n     Appeals reversed the BIA decision, and Ms. Nedkova was \n     eventually granted withholding of removal. See Nedkova v. \n     Ashcroft, 83 Fed. Appx. 909 (9th Cir. 2003).\n       Juanita Sauceda was ordered removed by an immigration court \n     while her husband was fighting in the Middle East with the \n     Texas National Guard. Together they have several U.S. citizen \n     children. Ms. Sauceda was ordered removed, despite the fact \n     that she was eligible to immigrate based on her husband's \n     petition as well as her mother's petition. Ms. Sauceda \n     appealed her removal order to the BIA which affirmed the \n     immigration court's decision. She then appealed her case to \n     the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and obtained \n     a judicial stay of removal during the pendency of her appeal. \n     Because she was granted a stay of removal, she was able to \n     continue caring for her U.S. citizen children while their \n     father fought in the Middle East. If she had been denied a \n     judicial stay of removal, she would have been deported during \n     the pendency of her appeal, and her U.S. citizen children \n     would have been abandoned in the U.S., with no parent to care \n     for them. See Sauceda v. Gonzales (5th Cir. 2005).\n       These real-life cases illustrate why all immigrant women \n     and children, especially victims of violence or persecution, \n     need to have continued access to judicial stays of removal \n     while their cases are being reviewed by federal courts. We, \n     therefore, respectfully urge you to support Feingold \n     Amendment 4083 which would preserve access to judicial stays \n     of removal, thereby ensuring that victims are not illegally \n     deported into the hands of human traffickers, batterers, and \n     rapists.\n           Sincerely,\n     Joanne Lin,\n       Legal Momentum Immigrant Women Program.\n     Gail Pendleton,\n       ASISTA.\n     Leni Marin,\n       Family Violence Prevention Fund.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to read from this letter to \ngive my colleagues a better understanding of whom this provision of the \nbill will affect. According to this letter:\n\n       Section 227(c) poses grave risks to many immigrant women \n     and children who, in the absence of a stay of removal, will \n     be deported and delivered into the hands of human \n     traffickers, batterers, and persecutors.\n\n  Let me read one example the National Network provided in its letter \nof a case in which the availability of a stay of removal was essential. \nLet me tell you about Lioudmila, Anastasia, and Aleksandra Krotova. \nAccording to the letter:\n\n       Lioudmila Krotova and her children Anastasia and Aleksandra \n     fled Russia after they were assaulted by skinheads and their \n     synagogue was stormed. Ms. Krotova reported both attacks to \n     the police, but the police failed to take any meaningful \n     action. After the Krotovas fled Russia, skinheads beat a \n     close family friend to death and also beat the Krotovas' \n     relative so brutally that they broke his hip.\n       After entering the U.S., Ms. Krotova applied for asylum. An \n     immigration judge denied her application, and the [Board of \n     Immigration Appeals] affirmed the judge's decision. Ms. \n     Krotova then appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals and \n     obtained a temporary stay of removal. The U.S. Court of \n     Appeals eventually reversed the BIA decision and concluded \n     that the harassment, discrimination and violence experienced \n     by Ms. Krotova on account of her being Jewish compelled the \n     finding that she suffered past persecution.\n\n  This is just one example.\n  The letter also talks about a woman who was ordered removed while her \nhusband was serving overseas in the Texas National Guard and whose \ndeportation would have left her U.S. citizen children no parent to care \nfor them. And there are others.\n  If my amendment is not adopted, these are the types of people who \nwill be affected, who will be sent back to countries where they could \nbe killed or torn from their families.\n  I assume those who support this provision want to ensure immigrants \ncannot file frivolous appeals in order to delay their deportation, and \nI wholeheartedly agree with that goal. But this provision is not \nnecessary to accomplish that worthy goal. The Federal courts do not \ngrant stays of removal when immigrants have little likelihood of \nsuccess. In fact, several of the appellate decisions that have rejected \nthe clear and convincing evidence standard at issue here have gone on \nto apply the four-part test I discussed earlier and denied stays of \nremoval pending appeals. Nonetheless, they have denied these stays in \nsome cases because the immigrants had little likelihood of success or \nbecause the immigrant could safely return to their home countries and \nawait the outcome. So this provision is really just a solution in \nsearch of a problem.\n  This amendment is about basic due process and fairness. It is about \ngiving individuals who have been turned down at the administrative \nlevel the opportunity to seek meaningful judicial review. And it is \nabout making sure that those who seek asylum in this country and who \nhave meritorious claims are not returned to persecution or even murder \nin their home countries before they can present their case to a Federal \ncourt.\n  That is why a long list of organizations have come out in support of \nthis amendment, including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, \nWorld Relief, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the National \nCouncil of La Raza, and more than 50 others.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a full list of the \norganizations that support this amendment be printed in the Record \nimmediately following my statement.\n\n[[Page S5149]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have been advised that the objection to \nsetting aside amendments has been withdrawn, so we will be able to \nstack the votes on the remainder of the amendments.\n  While I have recognition, I would like to comment briefly in support \nof the amendment offered by the Senator from Wisconsin. The standard of \nclear and convincing evidence, unless prohibited as a matter of law, is \na very tough standard and I don't think ought to be imposed here. It is \npreferable to use the regular four-part standard, which includes a \nrequirement that the petitioner is likely to succeed on the merits.\n  This particular matter has been commented on by a number of very \ndistinguished jurists. Judge Frank Easterbrook, appointed by President \nReagan, said that the interpretation in the current bill--the \ninterpretation that this amendment is designed to change--could require \nremoval of an alien who was both likely to prevail in court and likely \nto face serious injury or death if deported.\n  Judge Bruce Selya from the First Circuit, appointed by President \nReagan, said that the very situation the current bill would create is, \nin his words, ``absurd'' and ``Kafkaesque.''\n  Judge Jerry Smith, another Reagan appointee on the Fifth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, said that the situation the bill would create is \n``peculiar, at best.''\n  I believe the interest of justice would be promoted by allowing the \ncourts to utilize the current standards for granting stays and not \nimposing this extraordinary standard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am deeply grateful to the chairman, \nespecially for his support of this amendment but also for his \nleadership on this legislation. It is extremely important to this \ncountry. I know he worked so hard in committee to come up with a good \npackage that I am able to support. I particularly thank him for his \nsupport of the amendment.\n  I yield such time as the Senator from Kansas requires. I thank him \nfor his tremendous help on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Wisconsin for \nbringing forward this amendment and for highlighting the issue. I hope \nwe can get a strong vote from all of our colleagues on the amendment.\n  We heard about the issue of clear and convincing evidence that one \nhas to meet to keep from being sent home even though the standard is \nlower for one to actually win the case. I don't know anywhere else in \nthe law where one has to meet a higher standard at that point in the \nsystem than one would on final adjudication. This is really backward in \nthat particular situation.\n  I don't want to talk about that in particular, as I do the specific \nsituations that can arise and we can see easily enough happen. I have \nbeen to one of the detention facilities in New York, a place called \nWackenhut--an incredible name for a detention facility. I have been to \ndetention facilities on the border. I met with people who sought \nasylum.\n  I recognize the problem a number of people are targeting on this \nissue--and I think it is a legitimate concern to raise--that too many \npeople are claiming asylum status who are not legitimate asylees, and \nthey are not going to win in the system and are flooding the system \nwith requests. That is a legitimate concern. One can go into some of \nthese detention facilities and find a lot of people who are saying they \nare seeking asylum and asylum status, and on its face one can question \nwhether it is a legitimate case. That is a proper issue to raise, and I \nthink the people who put forward this amendment are targeting a correct \nissue.\n  Having said that, I have also worked with a number of people who, if \nyou take them in this situation and say: You can't meet clear and \nconvincing on the initial status, you are going home and wait there \nbefore you can come here for asylum status, and we send them home, they \nare going to prison or they are likely to disappear. They are likely to \ndisappear in that situation. I say disappear as in being killed in \nthose host countries to which they would go back. We can think of some \npretty easy ones. I had six refugees from North Korea in my office last \nweek. If they go home, they are in the Gulag and probably will not \nsurvive.\n  What about Iran? What happens if someone from Iran comes to this \ncountry and seeks asylum status, and we say it doesn't look clear and \nconvincing to us? How about Zimbabwe under Mugabe? That could happen in \nthis situation. If you are in a family that has been opposed to his \nleadership in that country, and we say: Well, I don't know, and you are \nsaying it is an uncle who caused a situation about which Mugabe is \nconcerned, and we say: I don't know, did the uncle do much; we don't \nhave a factual record on this--he doesn't have a factual record at all \nbecause they didn't let him leave with any factual record; you are \ngoing on his testimony, and he has to meet clear and convincing \nevidence--it would be very logical for a judge to say: You don't meet \nclear and convincing evidence. It is your word on this. We don't have a \nfactual record. We can't get to a factual record. You are going back to \nZimbabwe. And if he goes back to Zimbabwe, it is highly likely he will \ndisappear, as in being killed. This guy isn't going to make it, isn't \ngoing to survive.\n  In that situation, we should have the standard the same on the stay \nas on the final injunction, particularly at this early stage in the \nprocess and particularly when somebody's physical life is in jeopardy.\n\n[[Page S5150]]\n\n  I am afraid to say there are quite a few places in this world today \nwhere there are dictatorships or narrow one-party rule where if \nsomebody is sent back and they have been opposed or now even perceived \nas opposed, now that they have traveled outside the United States and \ntried to get away, or if someone is sent back to Syria or somewhere \nelse, there is a high likelihood they are going to disappear, they are \ngoing to be killed. They not going to be seen again in their home \ncountry. in this particular case, while I think the people who propose \nthe base portion of this text are accurate in seeing a problem that has \ngrown wide in this litigation, the narrow impact of this and the \nbackwardness of the adjudication process, having the final order being \na lower standard than this initial one, and the likelihood of physical \nharm, if not death, to the individual being sent home, we shouldn't be \ndoing that. We shouldn't be allowing that to happen. I would hope that \nwe could pass this amendment to change that standard so the final order \nand the temporary order are the same adjudication status and we don't \nget people killed inadvertently because we have put in a different \nstatus. This is important, and I think lives are at stake with this \none.\n\n  In far too many places around the world that I have been, you can \nthink and you can articulate a number of them that would come forward, \nbe it the case in Burma, or be it the case in a number of countries \nthat are dictatorships throughout Africa. You could look at \nTurkmenistan. I met yesterday with some human rights activists from \nTurkmenistan; a real question there is what happens to you. China, some \nreal questions in that country, particularly if you are a member of \nFalun Gong and you come here, or you are a student activist or knew \nsomebody who was a student activist. Again, most of it is on your word \nat this point in time and you can't meet the clear and convincing \nsteps.\n  So I would hope we could pass this amendment. I am fearful that if we \ndon't, we are going to see people sent back, sent back to death, and I \ndon't want to see us doing something like that.\n  I thank my colleague for proposing this amendment. I appreciate those \nwho are dealing with this issue. I do think this would be a good \namendment for us to pass.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, months ago in the Judiciary Committee \nmarkup I offered an amendment that codified the process of expedited \nremoval and extended it to include criminal aliens. We have to \nremember, this is about criminal aliens. What we do know from one of \nthe Judiciary Committee hearings is somewhere between 6 and 8 percent \nof the people coming across our southern border have a criminal \nhistory.\n  There are valid points to the questions that have been raised by the \nSenator from Wisconsin, who I have the utmost respect for, but I think \nthis is a question about what could happen versus what is getting ready \nto happen. What is getting ready to happen is instead of 28 percent of \nour Federal prisons today being filled with illegal aliens, it is going \nto become 45 and 50 percent, because they are going to stay here. We \nare going to give them 27 months. They are going to use stays to stay \nhere, and what we are trying to do is have a balance.\n  Is it possible that somebody could be denied entry into this country \nand have a negative consequence? Yes. But it is far more likely there \nis going to be a tremendous negative consequence to us in costs and to \nour children as we allow this system to continue to go on and be \nperpetuated the way that it is.\n  I also remind my colleagues that current law under what we call \nexpedited removal is law, and it is being carried out. What this \namendment does will get rid of the expedited and ultimately will get \nrid of the removal, and what we are going to see on criminal aliens is \nwe are going to see our prisons not having 28 percent illegal aliens \nwho are criminals, but we are going to have 50 percent. The cost right \nnow is $7 billion a year to our country, and $1.7 billion of that is \nassociated with Federal prison costs for illegal immigrants. So we are \ntalking about expedited removal.\n  The other thing to remember that we are talking about is this is only \ngoing to be applied to people who have been here less than 14 days and \nwithin 100 miles of the border.\n  The administration opposes this amendment, and for good reason. The \nFeingold amendment would allow aliens to remain in the United States \nand would perpetuate the incentive for aliens to pursue even the most \nmeritless appeals. That is what happens when we allow this. I am not a \nlawyer, but I know that the obligation for clear and convincing \nevidence is a high standard, and that is a difficult thing. But we have \nto measure it against all the other consequences of not having that \nstandard.\n  The arguments that the Senator from Wisconsin makes are real. They \nare true. But he doesn't talk about what the downside is, and the costs \nand the lost opportunity and actually human grief that comes from \nhaving that process for those who are going to bear the cost of it.\n  The section that the Senator from Wisconsin focused on in his \namendment is already law. It is already U.S. Code, Section 242(f) 28 \nUSC 1252(f2). All my amendment did to this section of the Code was to \nadd the judicial injunction being amended to include stays. What is \nhappening is that 90 percent of these stays are overturned right now. \nNinety percent of them are overturned at the appellate division. So \nwhat we are doing is comparing what could happen to what is happening \nand what is the cost of that.\n  The heart of the Senator from Wisconsin is good. The heart of the \nSenator from Kansas is good. The question is, How do we balance that \nwith the human costs of carrying out this sacrifice of not being 100 \npercent? We could be 100 percent. What we would do is not allow anybody \nto return to their country until we know that they are going to be \nadequately clothed and adequately fed. Forget abused and incarcerated. \nWhat about the standard of making sure they have the same opportunities \nthat people in America have. We are not applying that standard to these \npeople, the 90 percent where the stays are denied.\n  So I don't challenge what could happen to somebody who was denied the \nbasis of asylum. What I ask is, where is the common sense on how we \nhandle these thousands and thousands and thousands of cases that allow \nsomebody 27 months here, who uses the claim of asylum, which, in fact, \nhas nothing to do with why they are here, but allows them to stay \nanother 27 months? It also raises a tremendous cost for us, because \nthey not only have to be held, they have to be defended, and we are \npaying for that as well.\n  As to the points made by the Senators from Kansas and Wisconsin on \nthe possibilities of what could happen, it is true; they could. But it \ndoesn't consider what is going to happen if we continue to allow this \nabuse of the system where an injunction is forbidden by Federal law and \na stay is issued because they can't offer an injunction, because it is \nillegal to do so.\n  So is it a difficult issue? Yes. Do I see the problem of abuse of \nthis much greater than they? Yes. Do I balance the scales differently? \nYes. Because the undetermined cost and the undetermined consequence of \nthe way that we are doing it now is just as dangerous in the long-range \nmeasure of humanity as of the potential dangers of one person--even if \nit is one--if only one person was denied asylum, if it is just one, \nshould we go even further? The fact is we can't be perfect. Even \nwithout clear and convincing evidence, we are not perfect. Even 90 \npercent of those that are--the stays are overturned. Some of those we \ndecided wrongly. So it is not as clear-cut as the Senator would make it \nseem. And it is not just the issue of some people who might be \ninterested, because some are going back now after a denial of the stay, \nusing a better standard of evidence.\n  So I would hope that we would keep this in the bill. It is not in the \nHouse bill. It may not stay in the complete bill. But it is certainly \nsomething that will turn resources that are today wasted tremendously \nand turn those resources to help those people who get here and have \ngotten asylum to have a better life.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S5151]]\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven and a half minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I would like to use the time to respond to the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, whom I greatly respect. He is right, we can't be perfect \nabout this. This is a complicated situation. He is also right that our \ngoal here should be to achieve the right balance, and that is the \nchallenge before us.\n  My amendment certainly doesn't strike all the changes that are made \nin the bill; it just tries to address one particular mistake that was \nmade that I think was almost borderline unintended. The bill as it now \nreads greatly expands expedited removal. I am not objecting to that, \nand I am not suggesting that we should not do so. I want to do exactly \nwhat the Senator from Oklahoma has suggested, which is to introduce \nanother element of common sense and balance into this. So I want to \nrespond to a couple of things he said.\n  He began his remarks by saying this is about expedited removal; we \nwouldn't have a problem here if we were only talking about expedited \nremoval.\n  That is not the point. As I understand this provision, it goes well \nbeyond expedited removal to all removals. So that is the problem. In \nfact, we even suggested at the staff level on the floor in recent days, \nwe wouldn't have a problem if this change was honed and limited to \nexpedited removals. So it is simply incorrect--and I want the record \ncorrected on this--to suggest that this somehow deals with expedited \nremovals.\n  Secondly, the Senator says, Well, all we are doing here is broadening \nthe concept and expanding it to stays. That is a big deal. It is not a \nminor thing. What we are talking about here, and Senator Brownback and \nI gave real, human examples of what we are talking about, is situations \nwhere if somebody can't get a stay so they can stay in this country and \nnot be rushed to a situation where they may be harmed, that stay may be \ndefinitive for them in the form of death or serious injury or \npersecution. What we are talking about here is what is the standard for \nthat temporary stay so that they get the opportunity to make their \nsubstantive case on whether they should stay here on the merits.\n  Finally, the Senator suggested that this would lead to approvals of \nmeritless claims. Our judges know how to handle this sort of thing. \nUnder the current system, they don't just hand out injunctions on no \nbasis. As I read the standard for injunctions, they evaluate four \nfactors: No. 1, the likelihood of success on the merits; No. 2, whether \nthere will be irreparable injury if the stay is denied; No. 3, whether \nthere will be a substantial injury to the party opposing a stay if the \nstay is issued; and No. 4, the public interest. If those standards \naren't met, these judges don't just hand out stays. It is based on a \nlong-standing tradition in the law in this area. So the idea that \nsomehow this change would lead to meritless or automatic granting of \nstays is simply incorrect under the law.\n  So I hope that responds to the points that my friend from Oklahoma \nmade, and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If no one yields time, time \nwill be charged equally to both sides.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. This \namendment is not just some little amendment that is seeking to cure \nsome outlying kind of case. It amends existing law, as well as to \nstrike a provision that was added in the Judiciary Committee. It is \nopposed by the administration. The reason is because the administration \ntoday is using the part of the law that would be stricken here to \nremove, in an expedited fashion, illegal immigrants who come here, \nand--using the figures that are more current--over 10 percent of whom, \nby the way, are criminals, to their home country, the other-than-\nMexican illegal immigrant. Last year, there were over 135,000 of these \npeople who were apprehended, and they were from countries all over the \nworld, including a lot of countries that won't take them back, \nespecially won't take them back very quickly.\n  So the question becomes, What happens? If they are from Mexico, of \ncourse, you can simply put them back on the bus and take them to the \nborder. But if they are from China or Russia or Vietnam or some other \ncountry, you can't do that. First of all, you have to work with the \nother country to ensure they can be removed to the other country, and \nthen you have to keep them in custody until they can be removed. In the \nmeantime, if they want to make a case for asylum, they may do so, and \nthe only standard is the usual standard of credible fear.\n  So let's not labor under the assumption that this outlying case, this \nperson who will be subject to abuse if the person is returned home, \ncan't make an asylum claim. You can, and it is resolved just like the \nother asylum claims are resolved: If you can establish a credible fear \nso that you are put in a separate category over here, and you are not \nremoved to your home country.\n  But what about those who do not? Today there aren't sufficient \ndetention spaces for these individuals, and so many of them are simply \nasked to report back in a few days and they don't show up, obviously. \nSo they melt into our society.\n  It was to solve this problem that Secretary Chertoff invoked the \nexpedited removal plan, which originally just applied to two of the \nsections on the border and now will apply to all of the border. The \npeople are detained until they can be removed and the period for \nremoval is reduced from about a month down to about 2 weeks, so \ndetention space is adequate.\n  What happens if the Feingold amendment passes? Secretary Chertoff's \npromise to us that he would invoke expedited removal and be able to \nremove these people from the country--those who can't make a credible \nasylum claim--will be destroyed, because every one of them can file an \nappeal.\n  The law that currently exists says that you can't get an injunction. \nThe reason is clear. We passed this because it is obvious that \neverybody simply files an appeal, gets an injunction, and they stay. It \nis years before you get them out--if you can ever re-contact them after \nthey have been released. You can't keep them in detention for that \nperiod of time, so they are released and the chances are they never \nshow up. That is the experience we had.\n  Congress decided we can't do that, that it is just a free pass to be \nillegal. So we said, once you made your claim for asylum and it is \ndenied, and you have a final order for removal, and that can be made by \nan immigration judge--actually, it can go all the way through the \nImmigration Board of Appeals or, in certain cases, it can be by an \nimmigration official, but once that order is final you are on your way \nand you cannot appeal and enjoin your removal.\n  The ninth circuit decided in its wisdom that ``enjoined'' didn't \ninclude ``stay.'' So they said Congress may have said we can't enjoin \nthe removal, but we can stay it. As the Senator from Wisconsin pointed \nout, it is pretty much the same thing. So the ninth circuit got around \ncongressional intent. Nonetheless, the Secretary of Homeland Security \nbelieves that he can use expedited removal to remove most of these \nillegal immigrants, many with criminal records, from the United States.\n  What the amendment does is to strike both the injunction language in \nthe existing law and the stay language in the amendment by the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, which was intended to overturn that ninth circuit \ndecision and get back to the original intent of Congress. But the net \nresult is not to speak with a fine sieve or filter here, but to enable \neverybody against whom a final order of removal has been made to appeal \nand get injunctive relief from the final order of removal.\n  In the effort to solve a few outlier cases which could be solved by \nother means--and certainly the motivations of the Senator from \nWisconsin and the Senator from Kansas who spoke with respect to that \nare important, and I think we would all agree with those motivations, \nbut there is a better way to solve that outlier problem than to simply \nsay, for all of the people who come here illegally and get an order of \nfinal removal, they don't have to go; they can appeal, and they can \nenjoin the order of removal.\n  I am not sure if the Senator from Wisconsin would agree to this, but \none of the ways that you could begin to\n\n[[Page S5152]]\n\nlimit the application of this, not to destroy Secretary Chertoff's \nprogram of expedited removal, would be to ensure that the amendment of \nthe Senator did not apply to expedited removal. I am not sure whether \nthe Senator would be willing to do that, but that would be one start.\n  The Senator says it is not just expedited removal we are talking \nabout here, and that is very true. But we are also talking about \nexpedited removal and that is something we need to move forward with \nand not stop dead in its tracks. The problem is that the experience \nwith absconders is significant.\n  Mr. President, 90 percent of these appeals, when there are appeals, \nare resolved against the person making the appeal. So most of these are \nnot outlier cases. They are cases that were brought for the purpose of \ndelaying, to allow the individual to stay in the country longer and, in \nmany cases, to simply forget the judicial process once the injunction \nhas been granted or the stay has been granted, so that the individual \ndid simply meld into our society and never show up again. That is the \nconcern that we have, and this amendment sweeps with too broad a brush \nhere.\n  To deal with the outlier situation we do not have to remove the \nremedy of the final order of removal for the hundreds of thousands of \npeople who came here illegally and need to be expeditiously removed.\n  I urge my colleagues to understand that this amendment is serious. It \nis far-reaching. It is overly broad. It strikes existing law. It is \nopposed by the administration and it is unnecessary with respect to the \nunderlying purposes of the immigration problem that we are trying to \nresolve today. My colleagues should defeat this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from Wisconsin is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to use a couple of minutes \nof my time to respond to my friend from Arizona. I want to be clear \nthere is no intention here to get in the way at all of the expedited \nremoval cases or Secretary Chertoff's program. That is exactly what I \nwas saying a few minutes ago. Were this limited to expedited removal, I \nprobably would not be offering this amendment. In fact, we tried at \nstaff level to suggest that this kind of change be made. It was \nrejected. We were forced to do this, which I do not think involves, as \nthe Senator from Arizona suggests, outlier cases. These are dramatic, \nserious matters that could involve life-or-death situations for people \nall over the world who have come to this country and fear returning to \ntheir own countries or the countries where they may be persecuted--\nwhich the Senator from Kansas and I illustrated.\n  The Senator began his remarks by suggesting his position was existing \nlaw. Obviously, it couldn't be existing law if you had to propose it in \ncommittee. More important, he neglected to mention it wasn't just the \nninth circuit, which of course is frequently held up as somehow a court \nwe should not listen to--it is not just the ninth circuit that agrees \nwith my interpretation of this, it is the first, second, third, fifth, \nsix, seventh and ninth circuit that have all said this standard should \nnot apply to stays.\n  This is not some renegade court. It is an amazing array of courts of \nappeals around the United States. Only one circuit has taken the other \nposition, and here is why.\n  The Senator suggests that somehow these courts have inappropriately \ninterpreted the statute. But there is absolutely nothing in the \nlegislative history that suggests that this was supposed to apply to \nstays. So let's talk about what existing law is. The vast majority of \ncircuits in the country have done a proper job of interpreting the \nstatute. It was not supposed to apply to stays. So I again urge my \ncolleagues to support my amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Wisconsin would \nanswer a question that I have regarding his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. It is my understanding that current law--this is the \nImmigration Nationality Act--states:\n\n       No court shall enjoin the removal of any alien pursuant to \n     final order unless the alien shows by clear and convincing \n     evidence that the entry or execution of such order is \n     prohibited as a matter of law.\n\n  Is that provision of existing law impacted by the amendment of the \nSenator from Wisconsin?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I don't believe that is impacted because that refers to \nthe actual proceeding. It does not, according to the interpretation of \nthe circuits, apply to the standard for stays. That is what the \ncircuits have all said, except for one. That language, of course, \napplies to the main cases but does not apply in the case of stays. \nThere is nothing in the legislative history that supports the notion \nthat it would apply to stays, and that is how the circuits have come \ndown.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, in view of that answer, which is greatly \nconfusing to me, it is clear that the effort is not simply to eliminate \nthe stay language that Senator Coburn was successful in inserting in \nthe Judiciary Committee, but also the injunction language that is in \nthe existing statute. I don't know that you can read it any other way. \nIf the Senator from Wisconsin would like to clarify, I will certainly \nstand to be corrected.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. There is no intention to remove the language, or the \nrequirement of the injunction standard. I said repeatedly here that I \nbelieve, on the stays, the person who is trying to avoid removal and \ntrying to get the stay has to meet the standard for injunction. That is \nnot the intent of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes remain on the Senator's side.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this is a very real problem in the \nAmerican court system today. In fact, one of our Senators wants us to \nadd 9 new Federal district judges as a result of immigration, and we \nare having surges of cases involving immigration appeals to the courts \nof appeals, where people can take their appeals directly if they are \nunhappy with the system that has been set up where administrative \njudges, through the immigration department, make adjudications within \ntheir sphere of influence as to whether someone is here in this country \nlegally or not.\n  We are a great Nation. We are a nation of laws. Our strength is that \nwe provide a good legal system. That is why a lot of people come here, \nbecause they are tired of being abused in their home country. They know \nthey will be fairly treated here in our legal system. It is a key to \nour growth and prosperity and liberty.\n  These appeals are increasing in large, large numbers. Under this \namendment it would have the possibility of accelerating those increases \nof appeals, a great deal of it.\n  I want to say a couple of things. A person who comes to our country, \nto any country, comes at that country's sufferance. They are here \nsubject to the pleasure of that country and can only stay here \naccording to the laws of our country. The laws of our country give \nadjudicative immigration courts the power and responsibility to \nadjudicate those questions about whether or not a person can stay here \nor has to be removed because they violated some law.\n  One of the things that is wrong with immigration today is we have so \nmuddled and so complicated and so confused our thinking that we don't \nunderstand what has happened. So a person is here. They are here \nillegally--or at least on appeal and a second appeal and a trial and \nappeal with the immigration courts they have been adjudicated as not \nbeing here legally. What should happen then, I ask you? They have a \nright to appeal to the U.S. court of appeals--not even a Federal \ndistrict judge, the court of appeals of Federal judges, where we have \nhad a number of appointments recently, and it is one step below the \nU.S. Supreme Court.\n  They get a right to have that, but they do not get the right to \nremain here unless that court of appeals allows them to. In fact, the \nlaw is clear. In the vast, vast majority of the cases, they ought not \nremain here. They have no constitutional right to remain here after the \nadjudicative branch of the Government has concluded they are\n\n[[Page S5153]]\n\nnot supposed to be here. Their appeal can continue. They are not denied \nthe right to continue their appeal. But they are allowed to go back \nhome to their home country and to pursue their appeal otherwise through \ntheir lawyers in the appropriate way.\n  They say this focuses on asylum. I would say asylum represents the \nbest argument that can be made against the provisions of the bill that \nis now before us, but it does not apply just to asylum cases. It \napplies to all cases. Any immigrant who can maintain an appeal can get \nto stay in the country. We had testimony in the Judiciary Committee \nfrom the second circuit, a fine circuit court of appeals, that it takes \nthem on average 27 months to decide one of these cases. What happens to \nthat person during the 27 months, may I ask you? Two things happen. We \nhave to take extremely precious bed space and leave them in custody for \n27 months--remember, these could be people with terrorist connections \nor other connections--or we have to allow them out on bail. We have one \narea in our country where it was reported that 95 percent of the people \nwho were released on bail pending an immigration decision absconded.\n  That means they will go on, decide their appeal and some \nadjudication, and order that he is supposed to leave. Where has he \nbeen? He broke into the country, presumably illegally. Is he waiting \naround? Is he now going to show up so they can deport this person? They \nhave already melded into the community in an illegal fashion. It is \npart of the problem that we deal with and which is making our system \nineffective.\n  We have to simply understand that there is no right to be here after \na final adjudication has occurred while your case is on appeal in the \ncourt of appeals. But we allow them to. We give them a right, if they \ncan show sufficient evidence under the standards that the Senator \nmentioned, that a court can approve that and allow them to stay if they \nthink they have, according to the law, convincing evidence that they \nare rightly here. The court of appeals can override the adjudicating \nauthority of the Immigration Service and allow the person to stay if \nthey choose. We have had an abuse of that. We have had 10,000 such \ncases. With this amendment, we are going to see even more such cases.\n  I suggest that we must get serious about immigration. The more we \ncreate appellate possibilities, the more we can confuse the law. The \nmore we create exception after exception after exception, the more \nunable we are to operate a system effectively and fairly.\n  The fair principle is, if you are adjudicated not to be here, you \nhave no right to be here. But we give you a generous right to appeal to \na court one step below the U.S. Supreme Court, but you have to go home \nuntil that court decision. If they override it, he can come back.\n  I think that is preciously generous. I think that is fair and right, \nand it also provides that court, in narrow areas, to extend and allow a \nperson to stay if they feel it is necessary to do so.\n  I think this is a good amendment. The Department of Justice, I think, \nunderstands it.\n  Senator Coburn offered a good provision to the bill which was adopted \nin the Judiciary Committee. It should not be overturned here on the \nfloor.\n  We can be sure that those who have a good case to stay will be able \nto stay. But overwhelmingly, if you have been found not to be here \nlegitimately, you are not entitled to stay, you should go home. This \namendment undermines that principle.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I applaud Senators Feingold and Brownback \nfor proposing an amendment to correct a seriously flawed provision that \nremains in the immigration bill that we are likely to pass. Under \nsection 227(c) of the bill, Federal courts of appeals would be \nprohibited from granting an asylum seeker a temporary stay of \ndeportation unless the alien could prove by clear and convincing \nevidence that the order of deportation is unlawful. In many cases, this \nis the same or an even a higher standard than an alien would be \nrequired to meet in order to win his or her case on the merits. This \nresult has been described by one Federal court as ``Kafkaesque.'' It is \nalso fundamentally unfair.\n  Judicial review is the failsafe that guarantees the rights of men and \nwomen when the law is interpreted incorrectly or when human emotion or \nbias overcomes impartiality. Judicial review helps define our \nconstitutional democracy and is a value that is deeply embedded in our \nsystem of government. It would be a grave mistake for us to accept the \nprovision in section 227(c) and to ignore the wisdom of the \ndistinguished Federal judges who oppose this curtailment of their \nauthority to decide these difficult cases with care and consistent with \nthe traditional practices of the Federal judiciary.\n  A number of Federal courts of appeal are in agreement that the \nstandard contained in section 227(c) is inequitable and unworkable. The \nSecond Circuit has said that requiring this standard ``would lead to \nthe anomalous result that . . . an alien would have to make a more \npersuasive showing to obtain a stay than is required to prevail on the \nmerits, thereby permitting the removal of some aliens with meritorious \nclaims against removal.'' The Seventh Circuit has said that ``[t]he \nability to come back to the United States would not be worth much if \nthe alien has been maimed or murdered in the interim. Yet under the \n[clear and convincing evidence standard] an alien who is likely to \nprevail in this court, and likely to face serious injury or death if \nremoved, is not entitled to remain in this nation while the court \nresolves the dispute.''\n  Some will argue that this provision will prevent aliens from abusing \nthe system by filing frivolous appeals simply to gain the stay of \ndeportation. But it is unwise for us to sweep aside decent and \nhumanitarian treatment for many meritorious petitioners to prevent a \nfew from abusing the system. I think we need to consider very carefully \nwhether we want to mandate that our Federal courts get into the \nbusiness of remanding even one potentially meritorious petitioner back \nto certain torture or death before his or her appeal is finally \ndecided. I hope others share my faith in the integrity with which our \nFederal judges carry out their duties and that these men and women are \neminently capable of identifying and rejecting fraudulent or abusive \ncases without the need for the restrictive provision contained in the \nbill.\n  We cannot live up to our American values, which abhor torture and \nhuman rights abuses, and at the same time allow this provision to \nremain in this bill. I urge my fellow Senators to join me in supporting \nthe amendment Senators Feingold and Brownback propose.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, if the Senator is agreeable, I would be \nwilling to yield all time. I yield my time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this \namendment be set aside and be voted on later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, what is the time agreement at this \npoint? How much time do I have remaining on this issue?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Once the amendment is called up, the unanimous \nconsent agreement states that there will be 1 hour equally divided.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4108\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4108 on the \nearned income tax credit.\n\n[[Page S5154]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4108.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To limit the application of the Earned Income Tax Credit)\n\n       On page 364, line 22, after ``an'' insert the following--\n\n     ``alien who is unlawfully present in the United States, or an \n     alien receiving adjustment of status under section 408(h) of \n     this Act who was illegally present in the United States prior \n     to January 7, 2004, section 601 of this Act, or section \n     613(c) of this Act, shall not be eligible the Earned Income \n     Tax Credit. With respect to benefits other than the Earned \n     Income Tax Credit, an alien''.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, before I get into that, I would like to \ntake one brief moment to note that in an election which took place last \nnight the winner got 63 million votes, more than anybody who has ever \nrun for President. The winner is a fine Alabaman, Taylor Hicks, who was \ncrowned ``American Idol'' winner last night. I have to tell you I am \nproud of him. We watched it closely and with enthusiasm. If my wife \nwere voting in a normal election, she would be in jail because she \nvoted more than once for him, I can tell you. And we are thrilled. \nTaylor is Alabama's third finalist in the show, and after last night's \nfinale, he became the second person from Birmingham to be crowned \n``American Idol.'' Of course, that followed Rubin Studdard's victory 2 \nyears ago, and Bo Bice as a runner up last year. We are proud of that \nfact and we are proud of Taylor Hicks being crowned ``American Idol.''\n  Mr. President, I am also pleased that the sponsors of the immigration \nbill we are debating accepted my preemption amendment that I originally \noffered in committee. That provision, which was included in the current \nbill, relates to day labor centers and is included in title III. My \namendment makes clear that the provisions of title III which regulate \nthe recruiting, referring and hiring of undocumented aliens, preempt \nany State or local laws. The laws it preempts are those that require \nbusiness entities, as a condition of conducting, continuing or \nexpanding a business, to provide, build, fund or maintain a shelter, \nstructure or designated area for use by day laborers at or near their \nplace of business or take other steps that facilitate the employment of \nday laborers by others. Language identical to this preemption provision \nin the current Senate bill was included in H.R. 4437, the bill passed \nby the House of Representatives.\n  Empirical research proves that day laborers in the United States are \nused overwhelmingly by undocumented migrants. I would like to enter \ninto the Record along with this statement, an extensive January 2006 \nstudy of the day labor issue in this country entitled: ``On the Corner: \nDay Labor in the United States,'' by Abel Valenzuela Jr. and Ana Luz \nGonzalez of the UCLA Center for the Study of Urban Poverty; Nik \nTheodore of the University of Illinois at Chicago, Center for Urban and \nEconomic Development; and Edwin Melendez of the New School University, \nMilano Graduate School of Management and Urban Policy. The findings in \nthe study are based on a national survey of day laborers drawn from 264 \nhiring sites in 139 municipalities in 20 states and the District of \nColumbia. A critical finding of this national survey, page 17, is that \nthree-quarters of the day labor work force is comprised of undocumented \nmigrants.\n  The scope of title III goes beyond the prohibition of the direct \nhiring of an unauthorized worker or the requirement that employers \nelectronically verify the validity of the work authorization documents \nthey are provided by applicants. It also prohibits persons from \nrecruiting and referring undocumented workers and facilitating the \nemployment of undocumented workers. A number of local governments have \ntaken actions or sought to impose ordinances that facilitate the \nemployment of day laborers, many of whom are not authorized to work in \nthis country. Local governments have done this by providing public \nfunding of day laborer centers that act as gathering places where \nemployers can hire day laborers, and by requiring, as a condition of \nconducting their businesses, that business entities build and maintain \nday laborer centers on or near their property to facilitate the \nemployment of day laborers by customers or contractors.\n  In some instances, these local governments even force employers, as \ncondition of doing business, to hand out to day laborers a written \ndescription of their employment rights under the law. There is no doubt \nthat these local governments are directly or indirectly forcing these \nbusinesses to attract and recruit these day laborers to their property \nand facilitate their employment by customers and contractors. They are \nforcing these businesses to create what amounts to hiring halls in the \nform of day labor shelters. These ordinances or proposed ordinances \nexpose these businesses to liability under the employer sanctions \nprovisions of title III by forcing them, as a condition of conducting \nbusiness, to act as agents of the day laborers in facilitating their \nemployment. While these businesses may not hire the day laborers, they \nare forced to be parties to the hiring process, for which they face \npotential exposure to liability under section 205 and title III of the \nSenate bill, and the harboring provisions of section 274 of the \nImmigration and Nationality Act.\n  These local ordinances and practices put businesses in an untenable \nposition. Businesses oppose ordinances that provide for the \naccommodation of day laborers on their property, particularly when \nthese laborers are undocumented workers. Some local governments deny \nlicensing essential to expand or maintain their business if they do \nnot. It is a no win situation that Congress must address consistent \nwith the overall purpose of this legislation.\n  Without the preemption provisions I have offered to this bill, there \nwould be a gaping hole that would allow public entities to foster the \nemployment of day laborers, whom the recent study I have cited shows to \nbe largely undocumented workers, and force, through their regulatory \nand licensing authority, businesses to be their agents in this process. \nThis flies in the face of the overall intent of this bill, which is to \ncontrol our borders and eliminate the job magnet for undocumented \nworkers to enter this country. Through the preemption language that I \nhave added to title III, we have exercised the uniquely federal role \ngiven to the Congress under the Constitution to regulate illegal \nimmigration into the U.S. and to prohibit State and local governments \nthrough local regulatory authority to thwart the intent of Congress to \nprohibit the hiring and facilitation of hiring of undocumented workers.\n  Mr. President, let me share a couple of thoughts fundamentally about \nthe immigration bill that is now before us.\n  The question of immigration is clearly one of the most important \nissues of our time. This vote will be one of the most momentous of our \ndecade. The American people know that. That is why they are engaged in \nthis debate. That is why they are watching it. That is why your phones \nare ringing in your offices and mail is pouring in. They care about it. \nThey are focused on it, and they want something done.\n  A lot of people say, Well, they are angry at immigrants, they are mad \nat immigrants, they want to punish them, and they are not fair and \ngenerous. That is not so.\n  You know who the American people are mad at. I will tell you who they \nhave a right to be mad at, and that is the governmental officials they \nsent to Washington who refuse to create a lawful system of immigration \nto enforce the laws that have been passed by this Congress. That is \nwhat they are mad about. They have every right to be mad about it.\n  They were angry in 1986. What did we do? We passed an amnesty bill \nthat promised enforcement in the future. It was utterly not so. The \namnesty took place immediately, and the enforcement never occurred. \nThey have been asking, What is going on?\n  In 1986, we found that there were 3 million people who came forward \nto claim amnesty, and now they tell us 20 years later that there are 11 \nmillion people here illegally. Why shouldn't they be frustrated? They \nare not against immigration. The American people are not against \nimmigration. They are worried about a system that is lawless, \nunprincipled, and indeed makes a mockery of law. And they\n\n[[Page S5155]]\n\nhave every right to be so. They should not be forgiving if we try to \npull another fast one by passing a deeply flawed bill. I don't think \nthey will be forgiving. The problem is, this is a deeply flawed bill. \nIt is not going to accomplish what the goals are for immigration in \nAmerica. That is a plain fact.\n  It is amusing now to see the sponsors of the bill when confronted \nwith the problems, and those who say they are going to vote for it, and \nsay they do not like it, a lot of them, but they are going to vote for \nit. Do you know why they say they are going to vote for it? Because \nmaybe the House will save us in conference.\n  What a weak argument, that the great Senate of the United States, \ndealing with one of the most important issues of our time, is reduced \nto saying, We know this bill is flawed, we know we have problems, maybe \nsomebody in the House can fix it, but I am going to sign my name and I \nam going to cast my vote to pass it. First of all, immigration will not \nend if this bill is not passed. There is not going to be mass \ndeportation of people from America if this bill is not passed.\n\n  We should do what I suggested several months ago when they tried to \nrun this bill through. Remember, about a month ago, they tried to move \nthis bill through this Senate without any amendments. Harry Reid, the \nDemocratic leader, said we are not going to have any amendments. They \ntried to move it through, just slide it through, so the American people \ndid not know about it. Senator Frist finally said, no, we will pull the \nbill, and they reached an agreement that we would have some amendments. \nBut the bill that hit the floor, as I said at the time, was so deeply \nflawed, it would never be able to be fixed by the amendments we could \nbring up. I know Members care about this issue, as do I. They want \nimmigration to continue, and so do I. I can support an increase in \nlegal immigration.\n  What I am saying is we are voting on a bill, not some vague picture, \nnot some emotional deal. We have legislation before the Senate. Will it \ndo what we tell the American people we are going to do? Will we be \nhonest and faithful with the American people when we say this piece of \nlegislation is a comprehensive fix of immigration problems in America? \nI submit not.\n  As time has gone by, more and more people have seen this is a totally \nflawed bill. People are getting more and more worried. They had no idea \nand I am not sure the sponsors knew of a lot of the weaknesses and \nproblems with the legislation. Some have been changed by amendment but, \ntrust me, there are many more.\n  Briefly, I will mention the fundamental flaws in the legislation. \nThese are fundamental. What I am going to talk about today is not some \nnitpicking over the error of a draftsman. I am talking about \nfundamental flaws in the bill that make it unpassable, legitimately, in \nmy view. It should not be passed. That is why I have said it should \nnever, ever become law.\n  First, the people now here illegally, the 11 to perhaps 20 million \npeople here illegally, will be given, over a period of years, every \nsingle benefit this Nation can bestow on its citizens. That is amnesty. \nIn my mind, that is amnesty. I have tried not to use the word \n``amnesty'' in the sense that is automatically disqualifying. What I \nhave tried to say is we should not give those who violate our laws to \nget here every single right we give the people who wait in line and \ncome lawfully. That is a very important moral and legal principle.\n  In 1986, those who opposed that amnesty, warned that if we do so, \nmore people will come and they, too, will expect amnesty. We will have \nincreased numbers in our country, and we will be forced to grant more \namnesties in the future. That is exactly what they said. Go back and \nread the debate. Who proved correct? The other side said it is a one-\ntime amnesty, we will enforce the law in the future, and the result was \n3 million people were given amnesty. The laws were not enforced. Twenty \nyears later, we have 11 million people here, and we are talking about \nanother amnesty. We should not do that. Whatever word you want to use, \namnesty or not, we should not do that.\n  Second, the border is not secured by this legislation. We have not \nworked out the difficulties on the border. T.J. Bonner of the Border \nPatrol Agents Association, as reported in the paper on Monday in the \nWashington Times, said the House bill will not work and the Senate bill \nis ineffective. Why should we pass a bill the experts say will not \nwork?\n  Now, under our procedures, we can authorize fencing. My amendment to \nadd some fencing passed. We can authorize electronic equipment. We can \nauthorize more agents. We can authorize more bed spaces. But will we \nfund it? Will we maintain a determination in the years to come to make \nthis system work?\n  I submit that without the Isakson amendment, which simply says that \nuntil the Congress fulfills its authorization requirements under the \nbill, the amnesty cannot take effect. When it was voted down in this \nSenate, every American had to know right then there was no commitment \nto make this system work. If not, why didn't they vote for it? All it \nsaid was if we fulfill the things we authorize, amnesty can be given, \nif they choose to do amnesty, which remains in the bill.\n  The US-VISIT system is not working. The agents and beds and fences \nare not up. What about the workplace? That is a critical component in \nour legal system. The workplace verification system is not in place. \nThere is only a pilot system. We have not worked out the Social \nSecurity number problem. It is not fixed. We voted down an amendment so \nweak in dealing with that. We have not fixed that problem. So the \nworkplace is not fixed.\n  They say it is a temporary guest worker program, but it is not. The \nbill does not have temporary guest workers. People come into this \ncountry, and they ask for a green card as soon as they get here. We \nvastly increased the number of green cards that can be issued. And \neveryone comes in under the rubric, the big print in the bill that says \n``temporary guest worker'' and will be able to file for a green card \nthrough their employer the first day they get here. Soon they will get \nthat green card unless they get in some sort of trouble, and that \nentitles them to legal, permanent residence. Within 5 years of that, \nthey can become a citizen.\n  This idea that it is a temporary guest worker program is as phony as \na three-dollar bill. I hope we never hear that word mentioned in the \nSenate anymore. We should have one. That is what the President says he \nwants. The American people understand that and would be more supportive \nof that. That is precisely what we need: a good, temporary guest worker \nprogram and another program to allow people to come into the country to \ncitizenship. But we do not have that. They sold this as a ``temporary \nworker program'' when it is not.\n\n  The bill will increase immigration legally by at least three times \nthe current level. We have had no study which justifies that. Three \ntimes the current level? Has anyone heard a national discussion or \ndiscussion in the Senate about that? No.\n  We have conducted no official study of the huge adverse financial \nimpact this bill will have in the outyears. Any legislative body \nserious about this issue would have known of this problem long ago. \nEven before the bill was drafted, they should have known we would have \nthese consequences. The Heritage Foundation has estimated that in the \n10th, 11th year, through the next 20 years, this bill will cost $50 \nbillion a year. That is more than the budget of Homeland Security. It \nhas tremendous financial costs. We will have some increased taxes, yes, \nbut in the outyears it will not compensate for this. The reason is, the \npeople who will be given amnesty, a certain high percent of them, \nunfortunately, do not have a high school diploma. Once they become a \nlegal permanent resident, once they become a citizen, they are entitled \nto all the panoply of welfare and social benefits our country has.\n  We have taken no steps to ensure this country's immigration policies \nreflect our Nation's needs. Canada, England, Australia, France, \nSwitzerland, and the Netherlands are working on that. Canada has a \npoint system. They evaluate people based on what they can contribute to \nthe Canadian economy, and then they decide whether to let them in. We \nhave nothing like that.\n\n[[Page S5156]]\n\n  We know, from my analysis of the bill, it will allow in three times \nas many people, legally, as we allow in today, and that 70 percent of \nthose will be admitted without regard to what skills, education, or \nEnglish language capabilities they have. That is not a good principle. \nThat is not what Canada does. Is Canada a backward nation? I submit \nthey are smarter.\n  There are a number of reasons we need to vote down this bill. One of \nthem is the huge financial cost. I will talk about one of the most \ndramatic costs this bill will impose on the American taxpayer.\n  I offer an amendment to deal with the extraordinary financial impact \nthat will accrue to the American taxpayers as a result of the \nlegalization of 11 million people here today. I asked the CBO, the \nCongressional Budget Office, what the score would be with regard to \nearned income tax credits. They scored that over 10 years. It would \ncost the taxpayers of this country, this single program alone, $29 \nbillion. As soon as we allow people into our country who are here \nillegally now, to convert to legal status under the language of this \nbill, they will immediately become eligible for the earned income tax \ncredit. Most of these are low-skilled workers. They are not high school \ngraduates. They are making the lower wages. They will qualify for that.\n  Hold your hat. The average person who receives an earned income tax \ncredit check from the Federal Government receives $1,700 a year. The \nmaximum amount you can receive under it is $4,700 a year. These are \nhuge welfare payments designed to help working families, American \nworking families. It started in the 1970s. It cost about $1 billion \nthen. The figure today is closer to $39 billion, one of our largest \nwelfare programs. It has a lot of fraud, a lot of criticism, but it was \ndesigned with good intent, and it remains a good part of how we assist \nlower income people in America. These people will immediately become \neligible for that benefit.\n  When they become citizens, they are entitled to all the benefits. If \nthey go through this process and we provide a path to citizenship, they \nwill get that, and we cannot prohibit that. I would not want to \nprohibit that. I don't intend to prohibit that. We would not want to. \nBut prior to that time, they are not entitled to it.\n  Let me state why. As a matter of law and as a matter of fairness, we \nshould not reward them with this. People who come to the country \nillegally want to work here, we are told. They do not want to be on \nwelfare. They are not asking for anything special. They just want to be \nable to work in our country. We have allowed them to do that. They have \nnot asked for, in my view, welfare; they are not asking for it and are \nnot entitled to it. So what happens when they convert to a legal \nstatus? Are they then entitled to this gratuitous, generous program of \nthe United States of America that was designed to help American \nfamilies who have workers trying to get ahead, they get a little extra \nmoney each year? Should they be able to participate in that program? I \nsay no. I say there is no moral or legal reason that requires us to \nprovide this benefit as a reward and an inducement for those who have \ncome here in violation of our laws. It is just not required of us. And \nit is not smart of us.\n  People ask: How are we going to afford the fences and the several \nbillions for the cost to enforce the border? They cannot find the money \nfor it. I can tell you where we can find the money. They say that if \nyou built a fence all the way across the border, 2,000 miles--our bill \nhas 370 miles of fences--it would cost $4 billion or $6 billion. You \nhave heard them say that.\n  This legislation, under the earned income tax credit alone over 10 \nyears, will increase, according to the Congressional Budget Office, our \noutlays by $29 billion.\n  We can pay for the whole enforcement system on our border by not \ngiving this gratuitous benefit to people who come here in violation of \nthe law. They will be able to stay. They will be able to work. They \nwill have medical care. They will have education for their children. \nThey will have all those things provided to them free from the Federal \nGovernment or State governments, if need be. They get all those things, \nbut they are not entitled and should not be provided the earned-income \ntax credit, in my view.\n  They say: Well, they will pay taxes in the future. OK. Well, how long \nhave they been here not paying taxes? It is just not possible for us to \ndo everything. And this Government ought to ask: Why should we--out of \nfidelity to the taxpayers of our country, who already see that we are \nspending recklessly, and already have a major deficit--why should we \nprovide this benefit? I do not think we should.\n  The entire concept of earned legalization is muddled in this bill, in \nmy view. But that aside, what should we do about the cost and the \nbenefit that could be given to these people? Do we need to provide them \nan extra welfare benefit that they have no expectation of ever getting?\n  By the way, I told you earlier, that the amount of money this benefit \nwould cost over the next ten years was projected to be $29 billion by \nCBO. That was based on their estimate a few days ago that we would have \n6 million to 7 million people who would be given amnesty under this \nbill. Just yesterday, we received a letter from them that said those \nnumbers were wrong. They are now estimating it would be 11 million \npeople coming in. So I would submit, if you take that increased number \nand you apply it to the $29 billion estimate we have, we are talking \nabout at least a $40 billion outlay over the next 10 years. But $29 \nbillion, $40 billion, $39 billion, whatever the figure is, it is very \nlarge.\n  It is not necessary we provide this transfer payment, this outlay \nfrom our Treasury, directly to people who have come here illegally, and \nreward them in that fashion. What we should do is proceed forward. And \nif they move their way on to the path of citizenship, they would be \nentitled to it.\n  I thank the Chair and retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields the time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, here we go again. We have before us \nanother amendment that says legal workers under this bill must play by \nour rules--by our laws--but they will not be allowed to live by those \nsame rules.\n  I know that my colleagues know that illegal immigrants are ineligible \nfor the earned-income tax credit. The legislation before us does not \nchange that fact. But this amendment incredibly--incredibly--would deny \nthe earned-income tax credit to taxpayers who will be working in this \ncountry legally as a result of this legislation. Remarkable.\n  I want to point out again, it would deny an important tax credit to \nsome low-income workers who have legal status who are playing by the \nrules, meeting all the requirements of the legislation, who might \notherwise be eligible for the earned-income tax credit.\n  Some things are within a certain area that I can probably understand \nthe rationale behind it and legitimately respect and argue against. But \nwhat is the rationale behind saying people who have attained a legal \nstatus here, who are living by all our other laws and rules and are \npaying taxes--sales taxes, Social Security, et cetera, every other \ntax--are going to be denied a tax credit that is available to all other \npersons? We are not saying in the legislation that anyone who is here \nillegally would make themselves available to that. We are only talking \nabout people who are here in a legal status.\n  The legislation is designed, rightly, to ensure that legalized \nworkers and new guest workers would largely be taxed in the same manner \nas U.S. citizens. If they have attained a legal status, then clearly \nthey should pay the taxes. They would pay payroll taxes, income taxes, \nexcise taxes. They would pay back taxes for the period of time they had \nbeen working in this country prior to the enactment of this bill. \nPayment of back taxes is a very important part of this bill.\n  The CBO and Joint Tax Committee estimate that bringing these legal \nimmigrants into the Federal tax system would substantially increase \nFederal revenue collections overall. It is patently unfair to make them \nabide by our tax rules yet deny any legal workers equal treatment under \nthese same rules.\n  I am having a hard time understanding amendments as this which\n\n[[Page S5157]]\n\nwould really impose an indefensible double standard on legalized \nworkers. What is next? Are we going to say work-authorized immigrants \nhave to ride in the back of the bus? Some of these amendments are \nsending a very troubling message to the American public about what \ndirection we want our country to go. We need to be going forward and \nnot backward.\n  I wonder, do some of my colleagues really think there is an \nunderground movement afoot plotting and scheming plans for how foreign \nworkers can gain legal work status solely so they can freeload off of \nthe taxpayers? These people are here to work, and they are doing jobs \nthat most of us do not have the will to do. These are workers. They are \nnot risking their lives to come into this country with the goal of \nfreeloading off of us. They are here to earn a wage for the betterment \nof themselves and their families, the same reason our forebears came \nhere to this country. They aren't looking for a handout. They are \nlooking for a chance, a chance for a better life. And they are willing \nto work harder than most of us to have just a few of the opportunities \nmost of us take for granted.\n\n  This amendment, if adopted, would result in highly inconsistent \ntreatment of legal workers--legal workers. On the one hand, they would \nbe subject to income and payroll taxes in the same manner as other \nworkers, but on the other, they would be denied the use of a key \nelement of the U.S. Tax Code that can mean the difference of whether or \nnot food gets put on a child's table.\n  About 98 percent of the earned-income tax credit goes to working \nfamilies with children. Census data shows that the EITC lifts more \nchildren out of poverty than any other Federal program. This amendment \nto deny the EITC to legalized workers would harm children, including \nmany children who are U.S. citizens. Many of the children in these low-\nincome families are citizens who live in families that experience \nhunger and other hardships.\n  This amendment, if adopted, would mean that a large number of \nchildren would be thrust into, or deeper into, poverty. An Urban \nInstitute study found that 56 percent of young, low-income children of \nimmigrant parents live in families that experience hunger or other \nfood-related problems. It seems to me there is an issue of humanity \nhere on this issue.\n  We have spent a week and a half debating amendments to this bill. \nMost of the amendments that were designed to alter substantially the \ncomprehensive approach to immigration reform have failed. But they were \ndebated on and voted on. I think that has been a good showing for the \nSenate. I think we have shown we can debate honestly and openly and \nreach conclusions. Some of these issues have been complex and some \nfairly simple. We have been conducting business the way the place is \nmeant to have it conducted.\n  I hope that after all this effort, we will not now adopt such a \nquestionable amendment to a bill that provides a comprehensive solution \nto our broken immigration system--a solution that is based on sound \njudgment, honesty, common sense, and compassion.\n  Mr. President, I really, on this one, would like to see not just \nvictory in this vote but a significant signal that we would not engage \nin this kind of treatment of people who have come to this country and \nare in a legal status.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time for Senator Specter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I anticipate this amendment will not \nrequire too much longer. Our final amendment in the sequence is the \nEnsign amendment. So I alert our colleagues to the fact that we should \nbe starting on that amendment fairly soon.\n  Senator Sessions has, I believe, 7 minutes left. Senator Kennedy and \nI will take just a few minutes in opposition to the amendment and then \nyield the remainder of the time back.\n  Mr. President, it seems to me this is a fairly fundamental issue. We \nhave the earned-income tax credit designed to provide tax relief for \nlow-income families and individuals. And if you qualify for it, as a \ntaxpayer, it seems to me, when you are obligated to pay the taxes and \nbear the burdens of the tax system, you ought to be entitled to the tax \ncredit, and the fact that they are undocumented immigrants should not \nimpose a penalty on them.\n  We are dealing here with people of very limited means. We are dealing \nwith people who ordinarily may--probably do--have large families. They \nare fighting rising costs of living and fighting to maintain their \nsustenance, and they are at the bottom end of the economic ladder.\n  So if they are in line to get a modest earned-income tax credit, \nwhich, as the language says, they have earned, it is a tax credit that \nis an income tax credit they have earned. Just as they have to pay \ntheir taxes, they ought to get the benefits from the tax system. \nTherefore, I oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to the \namendment being offered by my colleague from Alabama, Senator Sessions. \nAs drafted amendment would prevent legalized workers and guest workers \nfrom receiving the earned-income tax credit even though these same \nworkers are required to pay both income and payroll taxes. I remind my \ncolleagues that, under current law, illegal workers are not entitled to \nthe earned-income tax credit and S. 2611 does not change that. Instead, \nthis amendment denies people who are paying both income and payroll \ntaxes a tax credit that other similarly situated taxpayers receive \nsimply because these people are legalized workers and guest workers and \nnot naturalized citizens. This is distinction that should have no \nrelevance for purposes of receiving the earned-income tax credit. To \ndeny these legalized taxpayers the right to the earned-income tax \ncredit is unjustified and grossly inequitable.\n  It is my understanding that CBO recently estimated that the workers \naffected by this amendment will be paying more than $62 billion in \ntaxes over the next 10 years. This will result in a net of more than \n$33 billion in revenue after the costs associated with all refundable \ncredits are taken into account. Mr. President, we haven't seen a $33 \nbillion revenue raiser in this Chamber in quite some time.\n  Earlier this month, we passed a tax cut that provides a significant \ntax cut to the wealthiest in our country. The reconciliation bill was \npassed in spite of the fact that it provides little to no tax relief to \nthe majority of the families in our country while raising our Nation's \ndebt by roughly $70 billion. The proponents of this legislation were \nquick to defend this bill even though it employed a series of budget \ngimmicks that would make Enron proud. Those of us who spoke out in \nopposition of this bill were repeatedly told that allowing the capital \ngains and dividends tax cuts to expire amounted to a tax increase--one \nthat would surely cripple our economy if not passed this year even \nthough the provisions didn't expire until the end of 2008. I find it \ntruly astonishing that a few short weeks later, we are debating an \namendment that denies hardworking taxpayers a tax break that they so \ndesperately need and are entitled to under current law. Clearly those \nwho argued that allowing the capital gains and dividends tax cuts to \nexpire is essentially the equivalent of raising someone's taxes, have \nto agree that taking away the earned-income tax credit from a working \ntaxpayer is a tax increase. Unfortunately, the target of this tax \nincrease is on hard working, lower income families--people who truly \nneed this tax break to get by.\n  The eanred-income tax credit is one of the few remaining tax \nprovisions in our code that provide significant tax relief to working \nfamilies. As my colleagues know, it is one of the greatest tools we \nhave to fight poverty and allow working families to have a roof over \ntheir head and food on their table. It is a way to ensure that those \nearning minimum wage jobs are able to put clothes and shoes on their \nchildren so that they can go to school. This is not a hand out. In \norder to get the earn-income tax credit, you have to work. Pure and \nsimple. To deny this credit to legalized workers and guest workers who \npay income and payroll taxes is not what this country is all about. It \nis certainly not in keeping with the bipartisan way this Chamber has \ndefended the earned-income tax credit and its recipients from misguided \nattacks.\n\n[[Page S5158]]\n\n  I hope that all of my colleagues will join me in defeating this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will just take a few minutes. I know \nthe Senator from South Carolina wants a few minutes. And then we will \nbe prepared to move ahead.\n  Mr. President, as has been pointed out during this debate, all of the \nmen and women who would become legal residents of the United States \nunder the terms of this legislation are required to pay income tax, \nlike every other worker in America.\n  What the Sessions amendment would do, is really quite extraordinary \nand grossly unfair. It would arbitrarily deny those immigrants who have \nbecome legal residents one of the tax benefits available to every \ntaxpayer under the Internal Revenue Code. That provision is the earned-\nincome tax credit, a provision designed to reduce the tax burden on \nlow-income families with children.\n  It is fundamentally wrong to subject immigrant workers to a \ndifferent, harsher Tax Code than the one that applies to everyone else \nin the country. An immigrant worker should pay exactly the same income \ntax that every other worker earning the same pay and supporting the \nsame size family pays--no less, no more. We should not be designing a \nspecial punitive Tax Code for immigrants that makes them pay more than \neveryone else. Yet that is exactly what the Sessions amendment seeks to \ndo.\n  The Sessions amendment would result in highly inconsistent treatment \nof legal immigrant residents and would drastically increase the amount \nof tax that many of these families had to pay. They would be subject to \nincome and payroll taxes in the same manner as other workers, but would \nbe denied the use of a key element of the Tax Code that is intended to \noffset the relatively heavy tax burdens that low-income working \nfamilies, especially those with children, otherwise would face.\n  Most of the EITC is simply a tax credit for the payment of other \ntaxes, especially regressive payroll taxes. The EITC was specifically \ndesigned to offset the payroll tax burden on low-income working \nparents. The Treasury Department has estimated that a large majority of \nthe EITC merely compensates for a portion of the Federal income, \npayroll, and excise taxes paid by the low-income tax filers who qualify \nto receive it.\n  The earned-income tax credit is not welfare; it is an earned benefit \nin the Tax Code that is available to all tax paying, low-income working \nfamilies with children.\n  Immigrant families who are legal residents are subject to the same \ntax as other workers in America. They have the same tax burdens, the \nsame tax benefit as everyone else under current law. The Sessions \namendment would change that, depriving legal immigrant families of one \nof the primary tax benefits for low-income families with children in \nthe Tax Code. To do so would be terribly unjust. I urge my colleagues \nto reject the amendment.\n  I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. This amendment is important in this regard. When is it \nenough? When does the punishment fit the crime and when does it go too \nfar? What role should tax policy play in punishing a violation of the \nlaw, whether it be a misdemeanor or a felony? I can tell you the role \nthe Tax Code plays when it comes to felonies. If you are a drug dealer \nand you have been convicted and you are on probation or in jail, once \nyou get out or off probation, you are not denied the earned-income tax \ncredit. If you are a convicted child molester, the Tax Code doesn't \nchange because of your crime.\n  I would argue that for the crime we are dealing with, coming across \nthe border illegally, jumping in line, a nonviolent offense, we need to \nhave some reasonable punishment and not go too far. If we change the \nTax Code because they violated our law, then how do we look people in \nthe eye in the category of illegal immigrants and tell them that they \nare being punished through the Tax Code in a way a rapist, murderer, or \ndrug dealer is not? That is not proportional.\n  It is a misdemeanor under our law to cross the border illegally with \nno specified crime, a maximum of 6 months in prison. I have been a \nprosecutor. Senator Sessions has been a prosecutor. I can assure you, \nthere are people who do really bad things that don't have to go through \nwhat the illegal immigrants are going to go through to earn their way \nback into our good graces. They have to pay a fine consistent with a \nmisdemeanor offense. They have to learn English. If you have committed \na felony outside of immigration law, you are not eligible to get in the \nprogram. If you have committed three misdemeanors outside of \nimmigration violations, you are not eligible to get in the program. If \nyou fail the English test, if you are out of work for over 45 days, you \nare subject to being deported.\n  What is left will be hard-working people who are trying to pay their \ndebt back to society and, on top of all that, have to pay all of our \ntaxes. And they should. It would be great if everybody working in \nAmerica paid their fair share of taxes. It would be unfair, after you \ntry to pay your debt to society by making it right after violating the \nimmigration laws, which is a misdemeanor, to throw on top of that Tax \nCode treatment that no other felon would get.\n  There is a point in time here where we are going to not just punish \npeople for a violation of the law but declare war on who they are. I \ndon't want to cross that line as a nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 14 minutes \nremaining, and there is 7 and a half minutes remaining for the Senator \nfrom Alabama.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. I thank Senator Kennedy.\n  Mr. President, I rise respectfully to oppose this amendment. Under \nit, workers who are in this country legally, as a result of the \nunderlying reform bill before us, would be prohibited from receiving \nthe Federal earned income tax credit. Yet these same workers would be \nrequired to pay both income and payroll taxes. That seems unfair. In \nother words, we are going to bring them out of the shadows. We are \ngoing to get them to pay taxes. But we will not allow them access to \nthe EITC.\n  Once they have earned legal status, these workers would be no \ndifferent from citizens or other legal residents who pay the same taxes \nand, if they have low incomes, qualify for the EITC.\n  Some have expressed concern that the underlying bill would increase \nFederal spending for programs such as EITC. It would. But you have to \nconsider the pluses and minuses. In fact, the Congressional Budget \nOffice recently completed a cost estimate of S. 2611, the underlying \nbill, and found that the legislation as a whole would raise Federal tax \nrevenues. New tax filers, people who come out of the shadows and become \ntax-paying citizens, are required by this proposal, as part of their \npath to citizenship--I call it probation, not amnesty--are projected to \npay more than $60 billion in payroll and income taxes over the next 10 \nyears. Once you factor in the cost of refundable credits provided to \nthese workers, such as the child tax credit and the EITC, the net \nincrease in revenues is still a significant $33 billion over the next \n10 years. It would be unreasonable for us to force these new workers, \nwho are legal and many of whom will be in the process of becoming \nAmerican citizens, to pay all these taxes and not be allowed to claim \nthe earned-income tax credit.\n\n  As has been acknowledged, undocumented immigrants are already \nineligible for the EITC. If you are here illegally, you can't qualify \nfor the EITC. We should not deny this tax credit to low-income \ntaxpayers who are working in this country legally.\n  One particularly troublesome effect of this amendment, I fear, were \nit to be enacted into law, is that it would further impoverish some of \nour Nation's poorest children. Because the fact is, 98 percent of \nearned income tax credit payments go to working families with children.\n\n[[Page S5159]]\n\n  Let me briefly recite the history of this remarkable program. The \nearned-income tax credit was first proposed by President Richard M. \nNixon. It was signed into law by President Ford. Since then, it has \nbeen expanded, because it has worked, by Presidents Reagan, Clinton, \nand Bush. These Presidents saw the program as a way to help promote \nwork and offset regressive payroll tax burdens on low-wage workers. \nThat is the point. We know that on so many average, lower-income, \nmiddle-income workers, the great increase in Federal taxes has not been \nthe income tax. It has been the payroll tax deductions. The EITC was \ncreated to help even that out.\n  It also has an effect on wages or effective wages. The Federal \nminimum wage has not been raised in more than 8 years. By one standard, \nthe minimum wage is valued at its lowest level since the Truman \nadministration. Many of the immigrants who earn legal residency under \nthe Senate bill will have earnings around the minimum wage. I hope we \nwill act to raise the minimum wage this year. But in the interim, \nparticularly if we don't, we certainly should not adopt legislation \nthat will condemn large numbers of low-wage legal workers to work \neffectively below the poverty level, even though they are getting the \nminimum wage.\n  This Senate bill does not create an immediate path to citizenship. \nBecause of that, the amendment before us would subject millions of low-\nincome workers to a regressive tax burden for as much as 11 years \nbefore they become eligible to receive the EITC. It is probably a \nminimum of 11 years.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider the administrative burden this \namendment would impose on the IRS which would have to determine the \nimmigrant status of many tax filers. The IRS is not currently equipped \nto make such determinations; that is, to determine the immigrant status \nof tax filers. It would be costly to implement new procedures. The \namendment would probably add to the heavy paperwork burden already \nfaced by those who file for the EITC.\n  The point of this comprehensive immigration reform is to bring people \nout of the shadows, to end the exploitation that some of them have \nlived under, to make them part of the American economy and give them \nthe ability to compete fairly at prevailing wage rates with American \nworkers, to offer them the equal protection of the law--I stress that, \nthe equal protection of the law--requiring them to live by the law, \nrequiring them to pay taxes, but also promising them that they will \nreceive the equal protection of the law. That must include our tax \nlaws, including the EITC. I urge my colleagues to vote against this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think we are prepared to yield back the \nremaining time on this amendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would like to speak further.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Then I will withhold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, let's talk about the question of whether \nthese ``legal'' workers have followed the rules and are entitled to \nthis benefit. Those granted amnesty under this bill entered the country \nillegally, and have not followed the rules. At this very moment, the \nlaw says they are illegal and subject to deportation from the United \nStates. Many of them have filed false Social Security numbers and \ncommitted crimes of that kind. We are not going to deport them. We are \ngoing to allow them to stay here. We are going to be generous to them. \nWe are going to figure out a way that under this bill the vast majority \nof them will be on a path to full citizenship. Anybody that becomes a \nfull naturalized citizen would be entitled to the earned income tax \ncredit.\n  My colleagues have said we are punishing these individuals by giving \nthem amnesty. They don't say we are punishing them by saying they have \nto pay a penalty. They are not saying we are punishing them by saying \nthey have to pay taxes if they owe them. One said we are declaring war \non who they are.\n  Those kinds of words and phrases indicate the bankruptcy of the \nargument that is being put forth. Under current law, they are not \neligible for the earned income tax credit. Under current law, they \nshould not be here. They are here illegally. We are now going to pass a \nlaw that is going to allow them to stay here, that will give them free \nmedical care, that will give free education for their children, and \nallow them to utilize all the services this Nation has put together \nthrough the taxpayers of America. Then we are prepared, under this \nbill, to give these illegal aliens, prior to the time they become a \ncitizen when we change the rules, $40 billion of the taxpayers' money. \nWhat offsets do we have? What efforts or plans have been made to pay \nfor that over the next 10 years?\n  Let me ask my colleagues: If we change the rules and we say we are \nnot going to enforce the criminal laws against you or the immigration \nlaws, why can't we say: you can stay here and, for the overwhelming \nmajority under this bill, you are on a path to citizenship, but you do \nnot get to claim the tax credit? This is a transfer payment. It is \nclassified as an outlay by the U.S. Treasury.\n  I was disappointed to hear a Senator try to compare this to having to \ngo to the back of the bus. I introduced and was pleased to see passed a \nresolution that gave the Congressional Gold Medal to Rosa Parks. It was \ngiven to her in the rotunda of the Capitol before she died. She is from \nMontgomery, AL. She was mistreated simply because of the color of her \nskin, and she was required to go to the back of the bus because of the \ncolor of her skin. I don't appreciate the suggestion that this \namendment is against civil rights. These people broke the law by \nentering the country illegally, and should not be able to take \nadvantage of this tax credit. This is a fair response of the American \npeople. Let me ask this question: What about Rosa Parks' descendants \nwho are paying taxes today? Their wages may be reduced this very day \nbecause of a large surge of illegal immigrants. This bill would \nincrease that by threefold. Who cares about their wages perhaps being \nreduced as a result? And it is their money that will be paid to fund \nthis $40 billion transfer payment to people who come here illegally. We \nare simply not required to give that benefit.\n\n  Now, what about taxes? They say they pay taxes. The truth is that \nlower-wage people--and most of these are lower-wage people--don't pay \nincome taxes. They pay Social Security taxes, but they will get Social \nSecurity under this proposal. They don't pay income taxes because they \nare low-wage. If they have children, they don't pay. Most of the people \nthat get the earned income tax credit don't pay any federal income \ntaxes. At the end of the year when they file a tax return they get, on \naverage, $1,700 per person. Some get as much as $4,700. It is not just \nfamilies that are eligible for this credit. Single people get it, too, \nthough not as much. It is an income tax credit. It is a payment to \nthem.\n  I suggest that this is an important issue and that we think about our \nresponsibility. We could pay for the entire enforcement mechanism for \nthe border of the U.S. by simply not rewarding those who have come here \nillegally, who never expected to receive this benefit, with $40 billion \nin transfer payments. That is not punishing them. They are free. They \nare able to go back if they choose. They are able to work if they \nchoose. They are able to carry on their own activities and make \nchoices. But they are not entitled because we give them the benefit of \nlegal status to receive this transfer payment that is provided for our \npeople under current law.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as I understand the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Alabama, these people are not mistreated, as others in our society \nhave been mistreated. Wouldn't an objective observer view mistreatment \nas giving someone legal status in the United States, forcing them to \nearn citizenship, a whole program to bring people out of the shadows, \nand yet say you are ineligible for perhaps the most important tax \nincentive for the poorest of Americans, called the earned income tax \ncredit? I call that mistreatment,\n\n[[Page S5160]]\n\nMr. President. I would call that mistreatment.\n  We are going to make you pay a fine, we are going to do a background \ncheck, we are going to make you work for 6 years before you can get a \ngreen card and, yet, while you are doing that--and most of you are low-\nincome people--we are going to deprive you of the benefit that was \nabsolutely designed to help low-income families. That is what it was \nall about. If you have a lot of children, I am sorry, but this benefit \nthat was specifically designed for low-income people, which is the \nmajority of the people we are talking about, just as all of our \nforefathers who came here were usually at the lowest wrung of the \nladder, and we are going to say you cannot have that benefit.\n  Why? Why is that? Then what we are really saying is that we are going \nto give you legal status, but not really, because under a Republican \nadministration, a way to try to help low-income families was designed, \ninstead of a handout to give them a credit, instead of welfare to give \nthem some extra income, but we are not going to give that to you. We \nmay cause your children to go hungry because you are low-income people. \nI don't get it.\n  It is mistreatment by any objective view. It is mistreatment. As the \nSenator from Alabama said, this is an important issue. Maybe for the \nfirst time since we have debated this on the floor I agree with him. I \ntotally agree that this is an important issue. It has a lot to do with \nwhat kind of country we are.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  Mr. President, the CBO and Joint Tax Committee estimates show that \nthe increase in refundable credits resulting from S. 2611 would be more \nthan offset by the income and payroll taxes new filers would pay. The \nnet effect of the increased costs and revenues would be a gain of more \nthan $30 billion between 2007 and 2016. So their estimate is that the \nnew legal residents would pay over $62 billion in income and payroll \ntaxes, while the costs of refundable tax credit, the EITC, and the \nchild tax credit would only be $29 billion.\n  Thus, the Federal Treasury would clearly benefit from these immigrant \nworkers becoming legal residents by about $30 billion. So only legal \nresidents are eligible for the EITC. Undocumented workers are not \neligible for the EITC today and will not be under the terms of this \nlegislation. However, when they become legal residents, under the \nprocess created by S. 2611, they will be eligible for the EITC going \nforward under the same terms of all other legal workers.\n  The Sessions amendment would deny these legal immigrant families with \nchildren the same rights to this tax credit as other low-income \nfamilies with children, and it is wrong and unfair. I hope it will be \ndefeated.\n  I withhold the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I had originally thought I was going \nto have 5 minutes to speak. As I understand it, we are kind of running \nbehind. I wondered if there is a 5-minute window that I could have \nperhaps after Senator Ensign speaks or at some point in this debate. \nWould 5 minutes be OK now?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think we are just about to vote on the \nSessions amendment and the Ensign amendment. That concludes the \namendments. Then we are going to have final passage. I think Senator \nByrd wanted to speak and others wanted to speak, too. I think the \nleaders said they hoped we would be able to move forward on these \namendments. So that is what we have been doing.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Would there be any time between now and the vote?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Perhaps the Senator from Alabama would grant the Senator \nsome time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama has 1 minute 27 \nseconds. The Senator from Massachusetts has 3 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think I need that time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will not ask for that time. Thank you, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will wrap up. Although it is my \namendment, I suppose I will give my colleagues the chance to have a \nfinal word. This bill would not prohibit those who come here legally in \nthe future from being entitled to the earned income tax credit even \nbefore they become a citizen. It would say, with regard to those who \ncame here illegally and have no entitlement whatsoever to this outlay \npayment from the U.S. Treasury, that they should not be able to get it \nuntil they become a naturalized citizen. That is not a punishment to \nthem. We are rewarding them with legality in our country. We are \nrewarding them with the health care benefits of our country and \neducational benefits of our country, and it is not required that we \nspend, I believe, what is a fair estimate of $40 billion over the next \n10 years to fund this program. That money alone would be enough to fund \nalmost the entire immigration enforcement system we need to put into \nplace. Maybe it would fund all of the one-time costs and much of the \ncontinuing costs of that program.\n  Why would we want to get into this argument that suggests that \nsomehow we are discriminating against people because we don't give them \na benefit to which they are clearly not entitled? We are giving them a \nnumber of benefits. We simply do not have to give this benefit. It has \nhuge implications for our Treasury. Any way you spin it, our deficit \nwould be $40 billion higher than if we don't adopt my amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Massachusetts has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield that time back.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We yield back our time as well, so now we can go to the \namendment by the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator call up the amendment?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4136\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I call up amendment 4136.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada (Mr. Ensign) proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4136.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (To ensure the integrity of the Earned Income Tax Credit program by \nreducing the potential for fraud and to ensure that aliens who receive \n an adjustment of this status under this bill meet their obligation to \n    pay back taxes without creating a burden on the American public)\n\n       On page 351, line 13, strike ``The alien'' through ``which \n     taxes are owed.'' on page 351, line 22, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(i) In general.--The alien may satisfy such requirement \n     by establishing that--\n       (I) no such tax liability exists;\n       (II) all outstanding liabilities have been met; or\n       (III) the alien has entered into an agreement for payment \n     of all outstanding liabilities with the Internal Revenue \n     Service and with the department of revenue of each State to \n     which taxes are owed.\n       (ii) Limitation.--Provided further, That an alien required \n     to pay taxes under this subparagraph, or who otherwise \n     satisfies the requirements of clause (i), shall not be \n     allowed to collect any tax refund for any taxable year prior \n     to 2006, or to file any claim for the Earned Income Tax \n     Credit, or any other tax credit otherwise allowable under the \n     tax code, prior to such taxable year.''\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I will speak very briefly on this \namendment. It is different than Senator Sessions' amendment. It does \ndeal with some of the very same programs, including the earned income \ntax credit. Senator Sessions' amendment addresses the tax credit \nprospectively. In other words, when somebody is given legal status \nunder this bill they would be prohibited for the first 5 years from \nbenefitting from the earned income tax credit.\n  My amendment is different. It looks back. When people have worked \nhere illegally, many used a stolen or a false Social Security number. \nThat is a felony. Our amendment says that under those circumstances, \nsomeone would\n\n[[Page S5161]]\n\nnot be able to qualify for the earned income tax credit. So my \namendment is looking retrospectively instead of prospectively. My \namendment would also disallow other tax credits that are meant for low-\nincome American citizens and legal residents.\n  Mr. President, I believe that I need to explain why this is issue is \nimportant. During this debate, the American people have heard, again \nand again, that people are going to earn citizenship. The supporters of \nthis bill reminded us of that every day. One of the things that they \nhave consistently talked about is the requirement to pay a $2,000 fine \nand they are also going to pay back taxes.\n  During the debate on my Social Security amendment, several people \nstated that immigrants have paid into the system. Most people who are \nhere illegally--and I think the statistics bear this out--are low-\nincome folks. Under our taxation system, most low-income people will \nqualify for the earned income tax credit. Which is a way to supplement \na person's income, like welfare, but through the tax code. With the \nearned income tax credit, a family that makes up to $36,000 a year can \nqualify for EITC. In 2005, they could be paid about $4,400 and in 2006 \na refundable tax credit of $4,500. So if we are making these folks pay \na ``penalty''--in other words, they have to pay back taxes--these folks \nwill qualify for this tax credit. In fact, many will get a refund \ninstead of paying their back taxes. So what will happen is that the \nU.S. taxpayers will actually write them a check.\n  This amendment will stop that from happening. It will stop people \nfrom receiving a retroactive tax refund while they were here working \nillegally. Senator Sessions does it prospectively. Mine does it \nretrospectively. I think it is only right, especially for those folks \nwho are here and have stolen an American identity and ruined someone's \ncredit history.\n  Last week, I spoke about Audra, a woman whose identity was stolen. \nShe had 218 illegal immigrants fraudulently using her identity. The IRS \nsent her a bill for a million dollars in back taxes. She cannot get a \njob. Her financial future is ruined. But what happens to the \nperpetrators of these crimes? Under this bill, those same 218 illegal \nimmigrants will not only qualify for Social Security, because our \namendment failed by 1 vote, but they could collect tax benefits too. If \nthis amendment is not adopted, they will be able to qualify for the \nearned income tax credit, up to $4,500 per year, for years when they \nwere, at the same time, ruining somebody else's credit and identity.\n  So, Mr. President, I think this is an amendment that should be \nadopted. It is a commonsense amendment. Even if one cannot support \nSenator Sessions's amendment, I think we should all at least be able to \nsupport this amendment.\n\n  Mr. President, does the other side want to go first?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 15 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, the Ensign amendment does more than prohibit the \nimmigrants from claiming the EITC when they file tax returns for the \nyears in which they were undocumented. The amendment would prohibit \nimmigrant workers from receiving refunds of their own money when more \nof their wages were withheld than they owe in taxes--do my colleagues \nunderstand? But under the Ensign amendment, when more is withheld than \nthey owe, they cannot recover the money.\n  What could be more unfair? The IRS is holding their money. It was \nwithheld from their wages and sent to the Government by their employer. \nSo these immigrant workers have now filed tax returns, like millions of \nAmerican workers each year. They have overpaid, and are entitled to \nrefunds. The Ensign amendment would prohibit them from receiving these \nrefunds. They cannot get their money back under the Ensign amendment. \nThe Government arbitrarily decides to keep it.\n  Beyond that--listen to this, Mr. President--on page 2 ``or any other \ntax credit otherwise allowable under the Tax Code.'' What could that \nbe? The child tax credit. This amendment also prohibits immigrant \nworkers from receiving the child tax credit. The Tax Code permits \nfamilies to take a $1,000 tax credit for each minor child. This is one \nof the most important provisions in the entire Internal Revenue Code \nfor working families. It recognizes how expensive it is to raise \nchildren today, and it reduces a family's tax liability by $1,000 for \neach child. It allows these families to pay less income tax so that the \nmoney can be used to help them meet the child's basic needs. But the \nEnsign amendment says to immigrant families struggling on meager wages, \ntrying to provide a better life for their children: You can't use the \nchild tax credit to reduce your tax liability, even though every other \nfamily can. It does not matter that in many cases your children were \nborn in the United States and are American citizens. Your children \nstill cannot receive the benefit of the child tax credit because you \nwere an undocumented worker.\n  As a result, an immigrant family with two youth children, maybe \nAmerican citizens, will have to pay $2,000 more in taxes each year than \nany other family in America who has the same income, same number of \ndependent children.\n  That is an incredibly harsh penalty to impose on these families. The \nEnsign amendment would impose a special punitive Tax Code on immigrants \nwho were once undocumented, making them pay higher taxes than anyone \nelse with comparable incomes, denying them the basic right to a refund \nof their own money when the employer withholds more than they owe.\n  I urge my colleagues to look closely at this unjust amendment and \nreject it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from South Carolina 4 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Ensign's \namendment. I very much appreciate him offering it on behalf of the \nAmerican people. I also appreciate the efforts of all my colleagues who \nI know have worked in good faith to try to create a better immigration \nsystem that works for Americans and our heritage of welcoming \nimmigrants.\n  As we have gone through this process, I think it has been a good, \ncivil, and constructive debate, but some of us are just coming down on \ndifferent sides.\n  My hope was as we went through this debate that we would recognize \nthe urgent sense that Americans have what we need to secure our borders \nand that we need to stop illegal immigration before we expand legal \nimmigration or increase benefits to those who are here illegally.\n  I had hoped that when Senator Isakson offered his amendment that \nincluded comprehensive reform but created a commonsense sequence, that \nwe in America would see that we need to control our borders before we \nadd additional legal immigrants. But when that amendment failed, I \nthink it discouraged a lot of us, that perhaps everyone wasn't working \nin a way that would be constructive for America's future.\n  We also saw when Senator Ensign offered an amendment that had some \ncommonsense ideas if someone had come here illegally and stolen \nsomeone's Social Security number, certainly they should not be rewarded \nby receiving Social Security benefits for the time they were using a \nstolen Social Security number. I think most of us thought that \ncommonsense amendment would have been adopted overwhelmingly. \nUnfortunately, it failed, which discouraged many of us who wanted to \nwork as part of a team toward comprehensive reform.\n  Now we see with this amendment a recognition that we don't need to \ncontinue to add reward on top of reward for those who have been working \nhere illegally. While we need to struggle to find a system that works \nfor America, we should not use taxpayer dollars, American taxpayer \ndollars to give tax credits to folks who have been working here \nillegally. This does not make sense.\n  Again, I encourage my colleagues to consider this because it is not \nonly unjust to Americans, I think it is unfair\n\n[[Page S5162]]\n\nto immigrants. This bill is ultimately going to create such a level of \nresentment for our immigrants. Once Americans see that this bill \ncreates rewards for those who have come here illegally, not just Social \nSecurity benefits but tax credits, citizenships, wages that in many \ncases are better than Americans', guaranteed wages, Americans are going \nto see this as unfair and resent the immigrants, and I think it will \nhurt our heritage of immigration in this country.\n  I appreciate Senator Ensign offering this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I believe the immigrants who are here 5 \nyears or more ought to be treated like everybody else. It raises very \nsimilar considerations to the arguments which I raised on the amendment \nby Senator Sessions.\n  Where they have overpaid in taxes, like any other taxpayer, they \nought to be able to get it back. Where they have children who are \nentitled to the child tax credit, children born in the United States \nwould be excluded under the Ensign amendment. They ought to be treated \nlike anyone else.\n  When Senator DeMint talks about resentment and fairness, I believe \nthere would be a lot of resentment and a lot of questioning of the \nfairness of treating the immigrants who have been here for more than 5 \nyears in a discriminatory fashion, not giving them back money they \noverpaid in taxes, or not according their children the child tax \ncredit.\n  I yield the Senator from Texas 5 minutes on my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, we have been debating for the last 2 \nweeks a bill that is going to change the course of our country. The \ndebate has been good. We have had the ability to offer amendments. Yet, \nthe bill has not changed to the degree it needs to change, to do the \njob that we must do to assure that we secure our borders. This bill has \nnot yet changed to ensure that we have a temporary worker program that \nworks, that does not discriminate against American workers, and that is \nfair. If this bill had gone through that process, we could then start \ndealing with the people who are here in a fair and responsible way.\n  Mr. President, we have benefitted from the immigrants in our country \nfor hundreds of years--people who come here legally and work hard. They \nmake better lives for themselves and their families, and they \ncontribute to our country in the process. They have assimilated into \nAmerica the ``E Pluribus Unum'' motto: Out of many, one. That has been \nthe factor that has brought us together for all of these years.\n  In the last 10 years, we have watched as millions have ignored our \nlaws. They have come into our country illegally, leaving those who have \nwaited their turn, who have waited for the legal process to work, to \nwonder if, in fact, they would ever be rewarded for their correct \nbehavior.\n  After 9/11, we all knew that our security was at risk. We have been \nforced to reexamine the laws of our country as they relate to our \nborders. Yet nearly 5 years after our country was attacked by people \nwho came in through a porous border, we still have a porous border. We \nneed immigration reform, and we must do it right.\n  There are some good points in this bill. Securing our borders is a \npart of this bill. I voted against the Budget Act point of order \nyesterday because I want to spend the money on border security, and it \nis going to cost money. But that is not the only part of this bill. The \nrest of the bill has caused an imbalance that cannot stand if we are to \nlook at the big picture for our country.\n  Edwin Meese, the former Attorney General of the United States, warned \nin a New York Times editorial op-ed that we are in danger of repeating \nthe mistakes of 20 years ago when Congress passed the Immigration \nReform and Control Act of 1986, granting amnesty to those who were in \nthis country. We are in danger of making the same mistake today.\n  Temporary workers are very important for our country. They provide \nU.S. companies with labor that keeps our economy thriving, and the \nworkers have the opportunity to make better lives for themselves. We \nalso need to make sure that we have some path for people who want to \nwork in this country, but do not want to be citizens. It is important \nthat we balance the rights of American workers' as we take this major \nstep.\n  The Hagel-Martinez guest worker program does grant amnesty, and it \nforces guest workers into a citizenship track after 6 years, even if \nthat is not what the worker wants or what they intended. In the polls \nthat I have seen, most of the people coming to this country to work do \nnot want to give up allegiance to their home countries, and they still \nlove America. They don't have hostility toward America because they are \nnot citizens. The arguments that I have heard indicating that we want \nevery temporary worker to be a citizen so that they will be loyal to \nour country, I believe does not hold water. You can be friendly to our \ncountry, appreciate and respect our country but not have to go into the \ncitizenship track to do that. People have been doing it for a long \ntime.\n  We do not have the capability in this bill that I tried to put in it \nyesterday with my amendment that would allow another choice--a choice \nfor people who do want to work in our country, go home, and who do not \nwant the citizenship track.\n  Mr. President, I will not be able to vote for the bill before us \ntoday, but I do hope I can vote for a bill that comes out of conference \ncommittee, one that will be balanced and one that represents the \ninterests of the American people, as well as treating fairly the \nforeign workers who come to our country.\n  I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  Mr. President, the 1996 historic welfare reform bill signed into law \nby President Clinton clearly stated illegal immigrants, people who were \nunlawfully in this country, would not be able to receive the benefits \nof the earned-income tax credit and would not be able to benefit from \nany of the other tax credits the law provides. That is right and that \nis fair. We should reserve those benefits for citizens and permanent \nresidents.\n  This bill undoes that. The bill says: We know what the law says, but \nnow we forgive you and, therefore, go ahead and claim those credits \nretroactively. Without my amendment, that is exactly what will happen \nin this bill.\n  The idea of stealing somebody's identity, stealing their Social \nSecurity number, ruining their credit, ruining everything that many \nfolks have worked so hard to achieve, and then rewarding the person who \nstole the identity seems to me to be unfair, it seems wrong. If you \nhave fraudulently used someone's social security number that--by the \nway--is a felony. We are forgiving that felony under this bill. So we \nare giving amnesty for that felony. It would seem to me that amnesty \nshould be enough. We shouldn't, at the same time, allow the person who \ncommitted a felony to collect Social Security benefits and to claim the \nearned-income tax credit.\n\n  I want to put up a chart here because people have been talking about \nthe earned-income tax credit. Senator Coburn earlier this year had a \nhearing on the earned-income tax credit. This program--and this is \npretty consistent with what I have seen over the years--has somewhere \nbetween a 23 percent and 28 percent error or fraud rate. That is the \nerror rate that currently exists each year without regard to persons \naffected by this bill. That fraud--according to best estimates--costs \nus over $10 billion a year. Just in errors and fraud. Now we want \npeople who are here illegally to be able to go back and claim a tax \ncredit adding more burden to the U.S. taxpayer, adding more to the \ndeficit.\n  It was said by some that our amendment doesn't allow people to get \nrefunds. That is absolutely true. If they paid into the system, and \nthey overpaid, you are correct, we do not allow tax refunds. One of the \nreasons for this provision is because it is impossible to determine \nwhether people using multiple social security numbers, as is the case \nwith so many illegal immigrants, have overpaid. In that regard, there\n\n[[Page S5163]]\n\nwould be no way to match a W-2 with the person who earned the wages on \nthat document. This bill places a huge burden on the IRS, forcing the \nservice to prove if someone has used 13 different Social Security \nnumbers. Sorting out who actually messed up the system. Having to prove \nwhat someone owes and if they have overpaid, if they have overclaimed \nor overdeducted, it is a huge burden. By the way, we are not solely \nplacing the burden on the IRS; we are also placing a huge burden on the \nAmerican taxpayer. How? The American taxpayers have to fund the IRS. So \nit will be very difficult to prove whether someone has overpaid or not, \nand whether they are due a refund. We take care of all of that. We say, \nNo, you don't get a refund and you cannot claim the tax credits that I \nbelieve are due for American citizens, and they certainly weren't due \nfor people who are here illegally.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes and 36 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding. I don't \nknow how to say it other than just to say it. We are beginning to take \ntax policy focusing on one group of people and tying it to criminal \nbehavior disproportionate to the crime, and we are beginning to set the \nstage for a different kind of America. Not only is it ill-conceived, it \nis dangerous. You can rape someone, you can murder someone, you can be \na convicted child molester, and our tax laws allow you to get a refund.\n  What kind of crime are we talking about here? Coming across the \nborder illegally, breaking in line to try to get ahead, because here \nyou can do really well and on the other side of the border you do \nreally poorly. I am sorry people did that. They need to pay for their \ncrime of coming across the border, which is a misdemeanor with no \nspecific fine set, with a 6-month cap on punishment.\n  But what are we going to do to those people who come here and we have \nallowed them to sit here--not sit here, work here, for our benefit, \ndoing things we don't want to do for years--we are going to say to the \nchildren who are American citizens, You are an American citizen as much \nas I am, but when it comes to your parents who came across that border \nfor you and your future, we are not going to just punish them, we are \ngoing to take the whole Tax Code and turn it upside down and do to your \nparents what we don't do to a drug dealer or a rapist or a murderer.\n  To my good friend from Nevada: Enough is enough. You have gone way \ntoo far. We need to get a grip on who we are as people. Punishment, \nyes. Revenge, no.\n  You want to talk about fairness? I have been a prosecutor, I have \nbeen a defense attorney, and I know you have to pay your debt, but this \nis a place where you can start over--at least it used to be. It is a \nplace where you have a chance to right your wrongs. Under this bill, \nyou do pay a fine; you do go through a very long process to earn your \nway back into our good graces. It is a misdemeanor. You pay a fine. You \nhave to learn English. If you are out of work for over 45 days, off you \ngo. If you commit a felony or misdemeanor unrelated to immigration, off \nyou go. We need the workers. We don't need bad people. We need good \npeople.\n  Every now and then, good people do bad things. At least I have found \nit to be so. Count me in that category. I hope you will forgive me if I \ndo a bad thing, because I have done plenty of bad things. It is because \npeople have seen the good in me, allowed me to start over and do right. \nThat is why I am in the Senate today, because people saw in me some \nthings I didn't deserve to have seen. So yes, let's give them \npunishment, make them do right, make them learn our language, make them \npay taxes and pay a fine, make sure they don't commit crimes. But once \nyou pay taxes, let's don't turn the Tax Code upside down just to kick \nyou around after you have done what we have asked you to do.\n  Please vote no. I yield back.\n\n\n                          Earned Income Credit\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Senator Ensign has proposed amendment \nNo. 4136 to this immigration bill.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. My amendment is designed to accomplish two purposes: one, \ndeny the earned income credit, EIC, to undocumented workers; and two, \nto ensure that applicants under section 601 are not manipulating their \ntax attributes to generate refunds that would not otherwise be due.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree with the objectives of Senator Ensign's \namendment. I note that the Finance Committee report welfare reform \nbill, known as the PRIDE Act, contains a technical correction to ensure \nthat Senator Ensign's and my objective with respect to the EIC is met.\n  Secondly, I will work with Senator Ensign and other interested \nmembers of the conference to achieve our second objective. We recognize \nthis amendment is our first attempt to make sure the applicants are \nfully compliant with our Nation's tax law. As such, the underlying \nbill's provisions and Senator Ensign's amendment will need to be \nfurther examined in conference.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I thank the chairman and look forward to working with him \nin conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I yield myself the remaining time.\n  The Senator from South Carolina just talked about how coming across \nthe border illegally is a misdemeanor. What he didn't address was that \nstealing somebody's Social Security number is a felony. In this bill, \nwe forgive that felony. We forgive it.\n  What we are saying is, if somebody who has operated under false \npretenses--the 1996 welfare reform bill signed by President Clinton \nsaid that they would not qualify for earned-income tax credits or any \nother tax credits that we have for the low-income folks in this \ncountry--this bill will reward them and reverse the welfare act. They \nwill be able to go back and say, Well, here is where I worked, and \npresent some W-2 forms, maybe falsified, but they can go back and try \nto claim that, and then qualify for the earned-income tax credit. I \nfundamentally think that is wrong. We are already forgiving a felony; I \nthink that is enough.\n  All of the things that the Senator from South Carolina said about \npeople coming here and working--and I am a big supporter of \nimmigration--I think it is the strength of our country: The diversity \nthat it brings, the hard-working people who make us appreciate America. \nI am as pro-immigration as anybody in this Chamber. What I want, \nthough, is folks who, when they are coming here, are coming here for \nthe right reasons. They are coming here to work hard. They are coming \nhere to do the things that make America great. I think that is \nwonderful. They are saying in this bill that people will pay \nrestitution, to earn legal status by paying back taxes. I don't know \nhow many times I have heard those words from the people who are \nsupporting this bill. In fact, under this bill, when immigrants go back \nto pay back taxes, to pay restitution, many actually get money from the \nfederal government solely because of the earned-income tax credit.\n  America is a compassionate country. We want to embrace people who are \ncoming--we always have--from around the world. But I don't think it is \nright to ask the American people, OK, forgive them for the felony of \nstealing Social Security numbers, we are going to give you amnesty as \nfar as citizenship and things like that, and on top of that, we are \ngoing to write you a check. We are going to write you a check courtesy \nof the American taxpayers. Yes, some may pay a fine and back taxes, but \nthe EITC and other tax credits will actually operate so that the \nAmerican people are going to write the illegal immigrant a check. \nWithout my amendment, that is exactly what can happen to financially \nreward millions of the folks who are going to be legalized under this \nbill.\n  Mr. President, is there any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-two seconds.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I yield back my time.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, there has been a lot of talk over the \nlast 2 weeks about immigration and the need for immigration reform. I \nagree our immigration system is broken. We\n\n[[Page S5164]]\n\nneed to secure our borders, protect American jobs and make sure those \nimmigrants in this country are treated with dignity. I rise today to \ntalk about two provisions that I fought hard to include in the \nimmigration bill.\n  First, the H-2B visa program, which rewards those immigrants who play \nby the rules while protecting American jobs. And second, the Kendell \nFrederick Citizenship Act. This act rights a wrong and corrects a \nterrible injustice. It makes sure those who are not U.S. citizens but \nwho are fighting to protect this country and have a green card can be a \nU.S. citizen quickly and easily.\n  My H-2B visa provision protects our borders by rewarding immigrants \nand employers who play by the rules. We are talking about workers who \ncome here on a seasonal basis but return to their families when they \nare finished with their job. Workers who honor their legal commitment \nto come here, work legally at a job and return home when finished with \ntheir work.\n  This provision protects American workers by requiring employers to \nrecruit American workers before hiring immigrant workers. It makes sure \nsmall business can continue to operate and pay their U.S. workers 12 \nmonths out of the year. It keeps small and seasonal businesses open for \nbusiness and guarantees the labor supply small businesses need during \ntheir peak seasons when they can't find American workers to take the \njobs.\n  This provision does not raise the cap. It allows employers who hire \ngood guy workers, workers who have played by the rules and returned \nhome after the work was done. These workers can be hired for another 3 \nyears and not count against the annual cap of 66,000 H-2B visas. It \nprovides a helping hand to businesses by letting them apply for workers \nthey have already trained to come back again, year after year and \nreturn home after the work is done. And it only applies to those who \nhave already successfully participated in the H-2B visa program--\nimmigrants who have received a visa and have returned home to their \nfamilies after their employment with a U.S. company.\n  Small businesses across this country count on the H-2B visa program \nto keep their businesses afloat when they cannot find local American \nworkers to fill their seasonal needs. They can then turn to the H-2B \nvisa program. Without being able to get the seasonal workers they need, \nthese businesses would not survive. These businesses try to hire \nAmerican workers. They would love to hire American workers. Under the \nlaw, they are required to hire American workers. These businesses have \nto prove that they have vigorously tried to recruit American workers. \nThey have to advertise for American workers and give American workers a \nchance to apply. They have to prove to the Department of Labor that \nthere are no American workers available. Only then are they allowed to \nfill their vacancies with seasonal workers.\n  The workers these businesses bring in participate in the H-2B visa \nprogram year after year, often working for the same companies. This has \nbeen the experience of the Maryland seafood industry. Yet they cannot \nand do not stay in the United States. They play by the rules, and \nreturn to their home countries, to their families. After the worker \ngoes home, the U.S. employer must go through the whole visa process \nagain the next year to get them back. That means an employer must prove \nagain to the Department of Labor that they cannot get U.S. workers. The \nprogram also requires that the employers pay these workers the \nprevailing industry wage.\n  This is not just a Maryland issue. This is not even a coastal issue. \nIt is an issue that affects everyone. Every State uses H-2B workers, \nfrom ski resorts out West and in the Northeast to quarries in Colorado, \nfrom landscapers who hire most of their workers in spring and summer to \nshrimpers in Texas and Louisiana. And of course the seafood industry on \nboth coasts.\n  Being able to hire seasonal workers is critical to the State of \nMaryland. We have a lot of summer seasonal businesses in Maryland, on \nthe Eastern Shore, in Ocean City or working the Chesapeake Bay. Many of \nour businesses use the program year after year. First, they hire all \nthe American workers they can find, but they need additional help to \nmeet seasonal demands. Without this program they can't meet their needs \nand many will be forced to limit services, lay off permanent U.S. \nworkers or, worse yet, close their doors. These are family businesses \nand small businesses in Maryland. Take for example J. M. Clayton. What \nthey do is a way of life. Started over a century ago and run by the \ngreat grandsons of the founder, J.M. Clayton works the waters of the \nChesapeake Bay, supplying crabs, crabmeat and other seafood, including \nMaryland's famous oysters, to restaurants, markets, and wholesalers all \nover the Nation. It is the oldest working crab processing plant in the \nworld. By employing 65 H-2B workers, the company can retain over 30 \nfull time American workers.\n  But it is not just seafood companies that have a long history on the \nEastern Shore. It is also S.E.W. Friel Cannery, which began its \nbusiness over 100 years ago. Friel's is the last corn cannery left from \n300 that used to operate on the shore. Ten years ago, when the cannery \ncould not find local workers, it turned to the new H-2B visa program. \nSince then, many workers come each season and then go home year after \nyear. They have helped this country maintain its American workforce and \nhave paved the way for local workers to return to the cannery. Friel's \nnow employs 75 full-time and 190 seasonal workers, along with 70 \nfarmers and additional suppliers.\n  Last summer, I went over to the Eastern Shore after the victory of \ngetting an extension to the H-2B visa program to meet with Latina women \nwho come to Maryland every year under this program. I asked them ``What \ndoes this program mean to you?'' They told me that coming here year \nafter year is hard work, but it means they can provide for their \nfamilies. They come in April and stay until late September when the \ncrab pots are packed up until the next season. During one summer here, \nthey earn more than they could earn in their home countries in 5 years. \nThey take this money back to their families and children who have been \nwaiting for them and build a well in their native village or build a \nhome or even pool their money to build a community center. Each year \nthese women come back to Maryland because they know the shore and they \nknow Clayton, they know Phillips; and they know they will have a place \nto live, a bus that will take them to church, access to translators and \nin some places they are even able to learn English. First, it is one \nsister and then another sister coming to the Eastern Shore for a few \nmonths a year to make money so they can take care of their families and \ncommunities back home.\n  Some of you may ask, ``why do we need this extension since the bill \nhas a temporary guest worker program?'' We need to make sure we do not \nforget the needs of small and seasonal businesses in this immigration \ndebate. I welcome the guest worker program that is before the Senate. \nOnce the program is up and running, it will help augment the H-2B \nprogram. But that is going to take time. We need to make sure that \nthere is no interruption so that companies can meet their hiring needs. \nWhen American workers don't apply for the job, the lack of workers \ncould mean a missed season. That doesn't just mean a loss of profit. It \nmeans a loss of a family business, because these businesses will be \nforced to close their doors.\n  Again this year, we have already reached the cap on the H-2B visa \nprogram. The first half of the cap--33,000 visas--was reached less than \n3 months after employers could begin applying. These businesses relied \non the exemption of returning workers to fill vacancies that were \nopen after trying to recruit American workers. We know how important it \nis to protect our borders, protect American workers and make sure small \nand seasonal businesses continue to operate. I don't need to tell you \nhow important our seasonal industries are to our State economies and \nour local communities. This provision in the immigration bill does all \nof this. Every Member of Senate who has heard from their constituents, \nwhether they are seafood processors, landscapers, resorts, timber \ncompanies, fisheries, pool companies or carnivals knows the need for \nthis H-2B program to continue.\n\n  I also want to talk about another provision in the immigration bill \nmeant to fix a broken bureaucracy and help noncitizens who are serving \nin our military become citizens of the United\n\n[[Page S5165]]\n\nStates. There are over 40,000 non-U.S. citizens serving in the U.S. \nmilitary today. Many want to become U.S. citizens but are caught up in \nred tape and paperwork, bureaucratic run-a-rounds and backlogs. And \nthat is wrong.\n  Many of these young people are on the front lines in Iraq, \nAfghanistan and throughout the world fighting terrorists. They are \nfocused on fighting the enemy, they shouldn't also have to fight the \nbureaucracy just to become a citizen of the country they are fighting \nfor. This provision in the immigration bill makes sure that it is \neasier and quicker for non-U.S. citizens serving in our military to \nbecome citizens.\n  This provision was inspired by a young man from Maryland who was in \nthe Army serving our country. Though not a citizen, he had a green card \nand was killed in Iraq on October 19, 2005. He was 21 years old. \nKendell Frederick was killed by a road side bomb on his way to be \nfingerprinted to become a U.S. citizen. But he was also killed by the \nbotched bureaucracy of the U.S. government, by their incompetence, by \ntheir indifference, by their ineptitude. This is inexcusable.\n  Every military death in Iraq is a tragedy, but this one did not need \nto happen. A Trinidad citizen, but fighting for America, Kendell \nFrederick was a terrific young man who came to this country when he was \n15 years old. He joined his mother here in the U.S. and wanted so much \nto be a part of this country. He wanted to serve this country and \njoined the ROTC while at Randallstown High School. After graduation, he \njoined the Army and went off to serve this country. In the Army, he was \na generator mechanic assigned to a heavy combat battalion. His job was \nto keep all of the generators running, which kept his battalion \nrunning. Kendell wanted to become an American citizen, yet a series of \nbureaucratic screw ups and unnecessary hurdles prevented that.\n  Kendell had been trying for over a year to become a U.S. citizen. He \nstarted working on it when he joined the Army. While he was training \nand learning how to become a soldier, Kendell sent his citizenship \napplication in and checked the wrong box. Specialist Frederick was busy \ntraining for war, packing to go to Iraq, saying good bye to his mother, \nhis brother, his two sisters--all the while worrying which box to check \nto become a U.S. citizen.\n  After that, his application was derailed by Immigration three times. \nFirst, after his mother checked the correct box saying Kendell was in \nthe military, the Citizenship and Immigration Service, CIS, sent the \napplication to the wrong office, not the office that handles military \napplications. Second, CIS rejected the fingerprints he had submitted--\nwith no explanation. Kendell had his fingerprints taken when he joined \nthe military. He had an FBI background check for the military. We have \nhigh standards to be in the U.S. military. But there was no \nexplanation. His mother did not know why the fingerprints had been \nrejected. Third, and finally, Kendell was told to get his fingerprints \nretaken in Maryland. But he was in Iraq fighting a war. His mother \ncalled 1-800-Immigration--that's supposed to be the HELP line. She told \nthem--my boy is in Baghdad, he can't come to Baltimore to get \nfingerprinted. She would have loved for son to come to Baltimore, but \nhe was fighting in a war, fighting for America. And CIS told her there \nwas nothing they could do. They were wrong. That was the wrong \ninformation. They were no help.\n  Finally, an arrangement was made. Kendell's staff sergeant made \narrangements for him to be fingerprinted at a nearby air base so he \ncould complete his application. On October 19, SPC Kendell Frederick \nwas traveling in a convoy to a base to get fingerprinted. He did not \nusually go on convoys, but that day he was in the convoy to get his \nfingerprints to become an American citizen and he was killed by a \nroadside bomb. Kendell was granted his U.S. citizenship a week after he \ndied. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.\n  Kendell was trying to do the right thing, yet he was given wrong \ninformation. He got the run-a-round. His staff sergeant tried to help, \nbut he didn't know all the rules, it was not his job to know the \nrules--he was fighting a war. His mother did the right thing. She tried \nto cut through the bureaucracy, making phone calls, sending letters, \nshe was diligent and relentless. The system failed--again and again. \nAnd a wonderful young man lost his life.\n  Kendell's mother--Michelle Murphy--could have just sat there, could \nhave boiled in her rage. She wanted to do something with her grief. \nWhen I spoke with her, she told me she didn't want any mother to have \nto go through what she went through, what her son went through. \nServicemembers and their mothers should not be worrying about what box \nto check on a citizenship application, which of many addresses is the \nright address to mail it to, where to get fingerprints taken when the \nservicemember is fighting for America. Mothers have enough to worry \nabout. Servicemembers have enough to worry about.\n  It took me introducing a bill to get Immigration's attention about \nthe problems servicemembers and their families face. The Department of \nHomeland Security is working with me and Kendell's mother to try and \nmake sure this does not happen again. They are working to get rid of \nthe red tape. This provision will make sure that no mother has to go \nthrough what Mrs. Murphy went through.\n  The Kendell Frederick Citizenship Act that is part of the immigration \nbill makes it easier for military servicemembers to become citizens. \nThe provisions of the legislation cut through the red tape. First, the \nact requires CIS to use the fingerprints the military takes when a \nperson enlists in the military, so a servicemember doesn't have to keep \ngetting new fingerprints. Second, it requires the creation of a \nmilitary citizenship advocate to inform the servicemembers about the \ncitizenship process and help with the application. Third, this \nlegislation requires CIS to set up a customer service hotline dedicated \nto serving military members and their families. And fourth, it requires \nthe Government Accountability Office to conduct an investigation into \nwhat is wrong with immigration services for our military.\n  No one should ever again have to go through what Kendell and his \nmother went through. The Kendell Frederick bill will make sure that \nanyone in the military who wants to be a U.S. citizen will be able to \ndo so, quickly and easily. If you are willing to fight and die for \nAmerica, you should be able to become an American.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise to speak about why I will vote \nagainst the immigration reform bill now before the Senate.\n  This is the worst piece of legislation that I have seen in my 20 \nyears in Congress. It grants amnesty to 11 million or more illegal \nimmigrants. It puts American workers at risk. It does little to enforce \nour immigration laws in the interior of the country, and worst of all, \nit does not even secure our border. It ignores the will of the majority \nof the American people. I cannot vote for such a dangerous bill.\n  In 1986, the year before I first joined the House of Representatives, \nCongress passed the immigration reform bill that got us into the \nsituation we are in now. Ed Meese, who was President Reagan's Attorney \nGeneral at the time, called it what it was--an amnesty for 3 million \nillegal aliens. Unfortunately, after that amnesty little attention was \npaid to securing our borders and interior enforcement, and the illegal \nimmigrant population grew to over 11 million.\n  The 1986 amnesty was a signal to illegal immigrants that if they came \nhere and kept their heads down, eventually they would have their crimes \nforgiven. The amnesty told them there was no reason to wait in line, no \nreason to follow our laws, just sneak into the United States, do not \nget caught, and eventually Congress would make them a citizen.\n  Well, that is exactly what happened. Earlier this week, former \nAttorney General Meese pointed out that Congress did not learn the \nlesson of 1986 and we are poised to repeat that mistake by passing a \nnew amnesty. I suspect that 20 years from now a future Congress will \ntalk about yet another amnesty.\n  A few weeks ago I came to the floor to talk about what kind of \nimmigration reform I support. I support, first and foremost, securing \nour borders. If we cannot control our borders, we might as well give up \non stopping the next terrorist attack.\n\n[[Page S5166]]\n\n  I support strong enforcement of our immigration laws inside the \ncountry. That means punishing employers who hire illegal immigrants. We \nmust provide employers the tools they need to make sure workers are \nlegal and hold them responsible when they turn a blind eye to who they \nare hiring.\n  I support an immigration reform bill that protects American workers. \nThat means a temporary worker program for when we need more workers, \nsuch as in our current rapidly expanding economy. But any worker \nprogram must make sure Americans are not being denied jobs in favor of \ncheap foreign labor. If there is a real need we should fill it, but \nforeign labor should never be a substitute for American workers.\n  Finally, I support continuing our long tradition of welcoming new \nimmigrants to America. Within reasonable limits, we should continue to \nwelcome people from around the world who want to become Americans. We \nshould not lock the doors to new immigrants, but anyone who wants to \nbecome an American must learn our language and assimilate into our \nsociety.\n  Because this bill does not follow those principles, I will not \nsupport it. The bill will not secure our border. It ties the hands of \nlaw enforcement inside the country to catch illegal immigrants. It is \nan amnesty for illegal immigrants that not only puts them ahead of the \nmillions who are already waiting in line, but in some ways it also \ntreats them better than American workers. Finally, the bill does not \nprotect American jobs, instead it encourages businesses to use cheap \nforeign labor.\n  I have heard a lot of talk the last few weeks from my colleagues \nsupporting this bill that say we must choose from either blanket \namnesty or mass deportation. That is wrong. If we passed a real border \nsecurity bill with tough interior enforcement, the illegal population \nwould shrink through attrition; in other words, the illegal immigrants \nwould deport themselves. After we secure our borders, we can put in \nplace a temporary worker program that protects American workers.\n  But that is not the path the Senate will choose today. I hope my \ncolleagues in the House of Representatives will stay strong with their \nbill when we get to conference. The other body passed a strong bill \nthat would make this country safer. That bill is not an amnesty bill. \nIt will make sure we get our border under control before opening the \ndoor to millions of temporary workers.\n  Again, Mr. President, I cannot support this bill. It is the worst \nlegislation I have ever had to vote on, and I will vote against it when \nthe roll is called. I put securing our borders ahead of amnesty, and I \nam confident the American people do too.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the Senate is scheduled to vote today on \na comprehensive immigration reform bill. With thousands of illegal \nimmigrants rushing across our borders every day, straining every sector \nof our society, congressional attention to this issue is appropriate \nand overdue. Unfortunately, S. 2611 is not the right way to reform our \nimmigration system.\n  As the son of an Italian immigrant who came to the United States in \n1930, I understand the important and valuable contributions immigrants \nhave made and continue to make to our country. I have great respect for \nthose who have legally come to our Nation seeking a better life for \ntheir families, just as my grandfather and father did.\n  However, as the Senate comes to a vote on S. 2611, I firmly believe \nthat the rule of law and our safety and security must be given by \nimportance. Who is traveling across our borders and why they are doing \nso is as important as any issue we currently face. It is a complicated \nissue, with far-reaching implications that will impact our national \nsecurity, our economy, and our culture.\n  Securing our borders is and must be our first priority. It is a basic \nresponsibility of a sovereign nation. An immigration policy that does \nnot control who is entering our Nation is not an immigration policy at \nall. The best way we can do this is by strengthening and supporting our \nBorder Patrol, both through greater numbers and technological \nadvancements. To this end, I cosponsored and voted for a successful \namendment that authorizes the Department of Homeland Security to \nconstruct 370 miles of triple-layer fence and 500 miles of vehicle \nbarriers at strategic locations along our southern border.\n  I also cosponsored the Ensign amendment which provides reimbursement \nfor the temporary use of the National Guard to secure the southern \nborder of the United States. With the approval of the Secretary of \nDefense, the Governor of any State may order the use of the National \nGuard for not more than 21 days in a year to provide ``command, control \nand continuity of support'' such as ground and airborne reconnaissance, \nlogistical, tactical, and administrative support, communications \nservices, and emergency medical services. I was pleased to see both of \nthese amendments pass as they are solid first steps towards border \nsecurity.\n  But the reason I voted against cloture and why I simply cannot vote \nfor this bill is that it gives amnesty to the immigrants who came to \nthis country illegally. I believe those who have entered this country \nillegally must return to their native land and move through the legal \nprocess just like everyone else. The idea that those who have been here \nillegally for an arbitrary number of years--a number that is, frankly, \nundeterminable as their time here is by nature undocumented--should be \nable to stay in America simply by paying back taxes is an insult to all \nthose who have waited, patiently and lawfully, for their chance to come \nhere and pursue the American dream.\n  There were many opportunities to fix this throughout Senate debate, \nbut I am afraid many of my colleagues have not truly heard the call of \ntheir constituents to oppose amnesty. I was disappointed that 58 of my \ncolleagues rejected a reasonable amendment offered by Senators Kyl and \nCornyn to ensure that the temporary worker program was \nactually temporary and not a shortcut to legalization or citizenship. I \nalso voted against the Feinstein amendment earlier this week which \nwould have given all illegal immigrants in the United States a path to \ncitizenship without having to leave the country.\n\n  I cannot support an amnesty proposal now because amnesty has failed \nin the past. In 1986, Congress attempted to address this same issue, \nthough on a much smaller scale. Estimates of the size of the illegal-\nimmigrant population in the United States in 1986 placed the total \nnumber close to 1 million; today we are dealing with around 12 million. \nIf providing amnesty to 1 million illegal immigrants yielded 12 million \nover the course of 20 years, with how many additional millions will we \nbe burdened in 2026 by offering amnesty now?\n  But this is not the only way S. 2611 rewards illegal immigrants. I \ncosponsored an amendment offered by Senator John Ensign that would \nensure illegal immigrants have a valid Social Security number before \nthey can accumulate credit to qualify for Social Security. This \namendment was intended to reduce document fraud, prevent identity \ntheft, and preserve the integrity of the Social Security system by \nensuring that persons who receive an adjustment of status under this \nbill are not able to receive Social Security benefits as a result of \nunlawful activity. In other words, this prevents illegal immigrants \nfrom getting Social Security benefits based on their illegal work \nhistory, often with an invalid number. Unfortunately, a majority of my \ncolleagues voted to kill this amendment. By doing so, the Senate has \nrewarded illegal immigrants by putting our current elderly \nbeneficiaries, who paid into the Social Security system for decades in \norder to collect the benefits they receive today, further at risk in an \nalready stretched system.\n  I would like to speak briefly on an amendment offered by Senator \nSessions that would prohibit aliens unlawfully present in the United \nStates with a green card from the H-2C visa program from claiming the \nearned income tax credit, EITC, when filing annual tax returns. This \namendment has good intentions, but I reluctantly must oppose it. The \ncost of EITC for the illegal-turned-legal population is steep. However, \nthis amendment goes further than I am comfortable with by treating \nthese resident aliens different from others. In my mind, a better \noption is another amendment offered by Senator Ensign that would limit \nillegal aliens from any kind of tax refund or an EITC claim on back \ntaxes for the time that they were here illegally. I believe this \namendment strikes the right balance.\n\n[[Page S5167]]\n\n  America is a nation of immigrants, a nation that derives much of our \nstrength from those who come here to live the american dream. But the \nimmigrants who have contributed so much to the character of our Nation \ncame here legally. We devalue their sacrifices and hardships if we fail \nto ask the same of today's immigrants. This bill does not do that. It \nrewards illegal behavior, threatens our social welfare system, devalues \nthe legal immigration process, and provides amnesty to illegal \nimmigrants. I will vote against S. 2611, and I urge my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to express my dismay that \nmy amendment No. 4022 to S. 2611 is not part of the bill the Senate \nwill vote on.\n  At first glance, the immigration bill we are considering takes into \naccount that if we put more border patrol agents and immigration \npersonnel on the border, other Federal agencies that deal with \nimmigration will need more resources. The bill adds new Department of \nHomeland Security and Department of Justice attorneys, public \ndefenders, and immigration judges. But the bill fails to account for \nthat fact that while immigration cases typically go before immigration \njudges, repeat offenders can be charged with felonies and tried in \nFederal district court.\n  As part of this bill, we should have considered the increased federal \ncriminal immigration caseload we will have as a result of increased \nborder security and immigration enforcement, and we should have added \nnew District judges to hear those cases.\n  Specifically, my amendment would implement the recommendations of the \n2005 Judicial Conference for U.S. district courts that have immigration \ncaseloads totaling more than 50 percent of their total criminal \nfilings. There are four districts that have such caseloads; \nunsurprisingly, all of them are on the Southwest border. Those courts' \nimmigration caseloads vastly outweigh the immigration caseloads of \nnorthern border district courts that the 2005 Judicial Conference \nrecommended new judgeships for.\n  For example, in the Southern District of Texas there were 5,599 \ncriminal filings in fiscal year 2004, and 3,688 of them were \nimmigration cases. By comparison, the Western District of Washington \nhad only 539 criminal filings, and only 78 of those were immigration \ncases. Similarly, in the District Court for Arizona there were 4,007 \ncriminal filings in fiscal year 2004; 2,404 of them were immigration \ncases. But in Idaho, there were only 213 criminal filings, and only 71 \nof those were immigration cases. In fiscal year 2004, the Southern \nDistrict of California had 3,400 criminal filings, and 2,206 of them \nwere immigration cases. On the northern border, in the Western District \nof New York, there were only 497 criminal filings; only 35 of those \nwere immigration cases. Lastly, in the District of New Mexico, there \nwere 2,497 criminal filings in fiscal year 2004, and 1,502 of them were \nimmigration cases. In the District of Minnesota, there were 431 \ncriminal filings, and only 15 of them were immigration cases.\n  With so many figures, the significance of those numbers may be lost, \nso let me sum those numbers up. In fiscal year 2004, my home state of \nNew Mexico, which shares a border with Mexico, had 100 times more \nFederal criminal immigration cases than a state that shares a border \nwith Canada.\n  The Albuquerque Tribune wrote an article about this issue in March. \nThat article, ``Judges See Ripple Effect of Policy on Immigration,'' \nsaid:\n\n       U.S. District Chief Judge Martha Vazquez of Santa Fe \n     oversees a court that faces a rising caseload from illegal \n     border crossings and related crime. And help from Washington \n     is by no means certain . . . Most typical immigration cases \n     go before an immigration judge, and the subjects are \n     deported. But people deported once and caught crossing \n     illegally again can be charged with a felony. And that brings \n     the defendant into federal district court. Those are the \n     cases driving up New Mexico's caseload . . . Some days as \n     many as 90 defendants crowd the courtroom in Las Cruces, said \n     Vazquez . . . The same problems are afflicting federal border \n     courts in Arizona, California, and Texas.\n\n  Mr. President, I will ask that this April 17, 2006 article be printed \nin the Record.\n  I would also like to read portions of a letter written to me earlier \nthis month by the New Mexico District's Chief Judge, Martha Vazquez. \nAbout the Senate's immigration bill, Judge Vazquez wrote:\n\n       As with past legislation aimed at improving border \n     security, this bill will significantly increase the number of \n     felony immigration and drug cases in the federal courts in \n     districts on the southwest border. The bill, in recognition \n     of this fact, provides funding for at least 20 additional \n     full-time Administrative Immigration Judges. The bill, \n     however, inexplicably fails to provide funding for additional \n     Article III judges despite the fact that Article III judges \n     will be as burdened, if not more, by the increased caseload \n     that will result from the bill's implementation . . . In \n     fiscal year 1997, there were 240 immigration felony filings \n     in the District of New Mexico. By fiscal year 2005, the \n     number of immigration filings increased to 1,826, which is an \n     increase of 661 percent . . . Increasing the number of \n     immigration judges will do nothing to reduce the increasing \n     caseload in the border states' federal courts.\n\n  Judge Vazquez was appointed to the Federal bench by President \nClinton. Clearly this is not a partisan issue, as Judge Vazquez and I \nagree that the Senate's failure to address the needs of our border \ndistrict courts in inexplicable. I will ask that this May 16, 2006, \nletter from Chief Judge Vazquez be printed in the Record.\n  Lastly, I would like to quote an article written this week. On May \n23, 2006, Reuters posted an article titled ``Bush Border Patrol Plan to \nPressure Courts: Sources.'' That article said:\n\n       President George W. Bush's plan to send thousands of \n     National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border could spark a \n     surge in immigration cases and U.S. courts are ill prepared \n     to handle them, according to congressional and courts sources \n     . . . Even without the stepped-up security at the border, \n     federal courts in southern California, Arizona, New Mexico \n     and Texas have been overburdened. Carelli [a spokesman for \n     U.S. federal courts] said those five judicial districts, out \n     of 94 nationwide, account for 34 percent of all criminal \n     cases moving through U.S. courts . . . Most immigrants caught \n     crossing illegally are ordered out of the country without \n     prosecution. But that still leaves a growing pile of cases \n     involving illegals who are being prosecuted after being \n     caught multiple times or those accused of other crimes . . . \n     Nationwide, each U.S. judge handles an average of 87 cases a \n     year. But along the southern border, even before Bush's plan \n     moves forward, the average is around 300 per judge, Carelli \n     said.\n\n  Clearly, there is already a crisis regarding our Southwest border \ndistrict courts' immigration caseload. As we worked on S. 2611 to \nprovide more resources to the Departments of Homeland Security and \nJustice, we should have also addressed the related needs of our U.S. \ndistrict courts. Senators Kyl, Cornyn, and Hutchison understood that, \nand I thank them for their cosponsorship and strong support of my \namendment.\n  Unfortunately, our other colleagues were unwilling to recognize this \nproblem or address this need. I was told that this amendment, with an \nannual cost of $11 million, was too expensive. But this bill authorizes \nbillions of new spending for homeland security and judiciary resources. \nI was informed that every State needs new judges. But not every State \nhas thousands of immigration cases filed each year.\n  I am disheartened that the Senate did not act on amendment 4022. I am \ndisappointed that my colleagues were unwilling to address the judicial \ncrisis along the Southwest border. I am dismayed that this body is \nturning a blind eye towards the need of our U.S. district courts. As a \nresult of such action, my State, and other States on the southwest \nborder, will not be able to enforce the border security and immigration \nenforcement provisions in the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act \nbecause we will not have the necessary resources to prosecute \nimmigration cases.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the aforementioned \nmaterials be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From Scripps Howard News Service, April 17, 2006]\n\n           Judges See Ripple Effect of Policy on Immigration\n\n                         (By James W. Brosnan)\n\n       Washington.--A rising number of immigration cases has New \n     Mexico's top federal judge keeping an anxious eye on \n     Congress' attempts to deal with border issues.\n       U.S. District Chief Judge Martha Vazquez of Santa Fe \n     oversees a court that faces a rising caseload from illegal \n     border crossings and related crime. And help from Washington \n     is by no means certain.\n       Left in limbo when the Senate adjourned April 7 was a \n     pending amendment to the\n\n[[Page S5168]]\n\n     stalled immigration bill that would authorize one new \n     permanent federal judge for New Mexico and another temporary \n     judge.\n       Sen. Pete Domenici, Albuquerque Republican, plans to renew \n     the effort for his amendment when and if the Senate takes up \n     the bill again.\n       ``As it stands now, we won't see any needed comprehensive \n     border security improvements in our state,'' Domenici said in \n     a recent statement. ``Our law enforcement won't get any new \n     and sustained help. We won't be adding any new federal judges \n     in New Mexico to take on the immigration cases that are \n     overwhelming our courts.''\n       New Mexico now has seven full-time district judges and \n     three judges on ``senior status'' who are supposed to hear \n     cases only occasionally.\n       But Vazquez said those three judges, James Parker, C. LeRoy \n     Hansen and John Conway, all in their 60s, still travel to \n     courthouses in Albuquerque, Las Cruces, Roswell and Santa Fe \n     and take a full load of cases.\n       ``We would be dying without them,'' said Vazquez.\n       From Sept. 30, 1999, to Sept. 30, 2004 (the end of the \n     federal fiscal year), the caseload in the New Mexico federal \n     district court increased 57.5 percent, from 2,804 to 4,416.\n       In the 2004 fiscal year alone, 2,126 felony cases were \n     heard, almost half of all cases in the entire 10th Circuit, \n     which includes Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming. \n     Most typical immigration cases go before an immigration \n     judge, and the subjects are deported.\n       But people deported once and caught crossing illegally \n     again can be charged with a felony. And that brings the \n     defendant into federal district court.\n       Those are the cases driving up New Mexico's caseload, along \n     with smuggling and drug cases, said Vazquez.\n       Some days as many as 90 defendants crowd the courtroom in \n     Las Cruces, said Vazquez. Pre-sentence reports have to be \n     prepared by district probation officers for every defendant.\n       Federal taypayers also bear the cost of housing the \n     prisoners in jails and transporting them to the courthouse, \n     as well as the travel and pay of their lawyers.\n       The same problems are afflicting federal border courts in \n     Arizona, California and Texas. Last summer, the federal \n     judges from those courts met and then appealed for help to \n     their senators.\n       The result is the amendment Domenici is sponsoring with \n     other border-state senators that would add nine permanent and \n     two temporary federal judgeships in the Southwest border \n     states.\n       Domenici also is sponsoring amendments to authorize $585 \n     million to improve the infrastructure for security on the \n     border and to add 250 deputy United States marshals.\n       But the burden on the federal court system could grow \n     dramatically if Congress decides to make it a crime to be in \n     the United States without proper documentation.\n       People caught crossing the border illegally face a \n     misdemeanor and are deported only if it is a first offense.\n       An illegal immigrant caught inside the United States has \n     committed a civil offense and is deported unless he or she \n     has committed another crime.\n       (An estimated 40 percent of illegal immigrants are people \n     who overstayed the limit on a legal visa, not border \n     jumpers.)\n       Last year, the House voted to make illegal presence in the \n     United States a felony, potentially creating 11 million to 12 \n     million new. The bill pending in the Senate has no criminal \n     penalty.\n       Last week, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, an Illinois \n     Republican, and Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, a \n     Tennessee Republican, said they would ensure the final \n     legislation reduced the felony charge to a misdemeanor.\n       Ever a misdemeanor charge can carry up to a six-month jail \n     sentence, which would require the appointment of a taxpayer-\n     funded lawyer for the indigent, unless the prosecutor waived \n     any possibility of jail time, said Jeanne Butterfield, \n     executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers \n     Association.\n       ``What's the point? Deport them.'' said Butterfield.\n       Federal courts processed only 9,343 misdemeanors in fiscal \n     year 2004 compared with 53,441 felonies.\n       Said Vazquez, ``Any time we criminalize behavior we have to \n     consider the consequences all the way down to additional jail \n     cells.''\n       Making illegal presence a misdemeanor also would conflict \n     with a bipartisan compromise in the Senate that would allow \n     80 percent of illegal immigrants--those here more than two \n     years--to obtain a visa.\n       A Frist aide, Elie Teichman, said any undocumented worker \n     who qualifies for a guest-worker program would be excluded \n     from the illegal presence provisions.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              U.S. District Court,\n\n\n                                       District of New Mexico,\n\n                                       Santa Fe, NM, May 16, 2006.\n     Sen. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Domenici: I understand that this week the \n     Senate will be debating the Border Security and Immigration \n     Reform Bill. As with past legislation aimed at improving \n     border security, this bill will significantly increase the \n     number of felony immigration and drug cases in the federal \n     courts in districts on the southwest border. The bill, in \n     recognition of this fact, provides funding for at least 20 \n     additional full-time Administrative Immigration Judges. The \n     bill, however, inexplicably fails to provide funding for \n     additional Article III Judges despite the fact that Article \n     III Judges will be as burdened, if not more, by the increased \n     caseload that will result from the bill's implementation. The \n     bill's failure to provide for critical resources is greatly \n     concerning to those involved in the administration of justice \n     in these districts.\n       The Judicial Conference of the United States determines the \n     need for new judgeships and has established the standard of \n     430 weighted filings per judgeship. As of September 30, 2005 \n     the weighted filing per judgeship in the District of New \n     Mexico is 586. That figure is 36 percent higher than the \n     established standard and justifies a minimum of two \n     additional Article III judgeships. The Judicial Conference \n     does not use projected filings when requesting additional \n     judgeships from Congress. Without question, the expected \n     increase in filings that will result from the pending \n     legislation will only further burden the Article III Judges \n     in this District.\n       As it is, the burden on Article III Judges in this District \n     is considerable. This District ranks first among all \n     districts in criminal filings per judgeship: 405 criminal \n     filings compared to the national average of 87. As in all \n     federal districts along the southwest border, the majority of \n     cases filed in this District relate to immigration offenses \n     under United States Code, Title 8 and drug offenses arising \n     under Title 21. Immigration and drug cases account for 85 \n     percent of the caseload in the District of New Mexico. And \n     the numbers of filings have increased exponentially in recent \n     years. In fiscal year 1997, there were 240 immigration felony \n     filings in the District of New Mexico. By fiscal year 2005, \n     the number of immigration felony filings increased to 1,826, \n     which is an increase of 661 percent. During this same period \n     drug cases have increased by 87 percent (298 to 558). Since \n     1997, the overall felony filings in the District of New \n     Mexico has increased by 287 percent. Of course, the court \n     cannot control the volume of cases that are filed. The United \n     States Attorney is responsible for bringing criminal cases to \n     federal court.\n       Administrative Immigration Judges and Article III Judges \n     perform entirely different tasks in the process of \n     adjudicating immigration cases. Immigration Judges decide \n     civil immigration questions. Article III Judges, on the other \n     hand, are responsible for the trials and sentencings of those \n     who are accused or convicted of immigration and border \n     security offenses. Article III Judges oversee an extensive \n     background check on every felony defendant who appears before \n     them on immigration charges to insure that the defendant does \n     not pose a national security threat. This critically \n     important task requires time and great deal of resources. \n     Increasing the number of Immigration Judges will do nothing \n     to reduce the increasing caseload in the border states' \n     federal courts. The consequences of failing to add more \n     Article III Judges will create an even greater burden in this \n     District, cause a backlog and imperil the court's ability to \n     fulfill the ``Speedy Trial Act.''\n       Further frustrating the District's ability to handle its \n     criminal docket is the fact that, even as the District \n     recently added to Magistrate Judges in Las Cruces, other \n     court related resources have remained static, or worse. have \n     declined. While law enforcement resources have increased, \n     there has been no corresponding increase in the number of \n     defense attorneys, Assistant United States Attorneys, Deputy \n     United States. Marshals, Probation and Pretrial officers, \n     interpreters, or courtroom space. Simply put, the District of \n     New Mexico desperately needs increased resources--across the \n     board--to enable it to keep pace with increasing border-\n     related demands.\n       I truly appreciate all you have done and continue to do for \n     the District of New Mexico. If you have any questions, please \n     do not hesitate to contact me or my staff at (505) 988-6330.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Martha Vazquez,\n     Chief Judge.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      [From Reuters, May 23, 2006]\n\n          Bush Border Patrol Plan To Pressure Courts: Sources\n\n                           (By Richard Cowan)\n\n       President George W. Bush's plan to send thousands of \n     National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border could spark a \n     surge in immigration cases and U.S. courts are ill prepared \n     to handle them, according to congressional and court sources.\n       The administration failed to plan for the surge in court \n     cases and did not consult the judicial branch on the impact \n     more arrests would have on federal courts in the region, said \n     Dick Carelli, a spokesman for U.S. Federal courts.\n       Bush asked for $1.9 billion in emergency funds for the \n     border plan, including $20 million to help the Justice \n     Department deal with its increased caseload, but that did not \n     include the courts.\n       ``We were left out of the process,'' Carelli said. He added \n     that since Bush unveiled his proposal to increase border \n     patrols, federal judiciary officials have had to quickly \n     cobble together a proposal to Congress for $20.3 million in \n     emergency funds to hire three full-time judges and about 240 \n     support staff for the Southwest.\n       Even without the stepped-up security at the border, federal \n     courts in southern California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas \n     have\n\n[[Page S5169]]\n\n     been over burdened. Carelli said those five judicial \n     districts, out of 94 nationwide, account for 34 percent of \n     all criminal cases moving through U.S. courts.\n       ``It's irresponsible to think that you can take care of the \n     border security problem without also addressing the justice \n     enforcement problem, which federal courts are indispensable \n     in,'' said a congressional aide.\n       Most immigrants caught crossing illegally are ordered out \n     of the country without prosecution. But that still leaves a \n     growing pile of cases involving illegals who are being \n     prosecuted after being caught multiple times or those accused \n     of other crimes.\n       Public defenders, pretrial services and probation officers \n     are all provided by the federal courts. ``And obviously, \n     those hearings have to take place in federal courts. The \n     border courts and the judiciary are just being swamped,'' the \n     congressional aide said.\n       A Bush administration official said that emergency funds \n     requested for the Justice Department will help hire \n     immigration attorneys and other support staff. ``By \n     increasing the Department of Justice's ability to hear and \n     process immigration-related cases, the belief is that the \n     impact on the judicial branch will be mitigated,'' the \n     official said.\n       Just five months before congressional elections, public \n     opinion polls show immigration concerns are at the top of \n     voters' list of worries.\n       The U.S. Senate is trying to pass a bill this week that \n     would further tighten border security and give some illegals \n     already in America a route toward citizenship.\n       But it is unclear whether the House of Representatives, \n     which has passed a tougher border security bill, will work \n     out a compromise with the Senate.\n       Congress and the White House have been arguing over whether \n     Bush's plan for more border guards is the best short-term fix \n     or whether the limited amount of emergency funds should be \n     dedicated to buying vehicles, aircraft and other supplies for \n     existing patrols.\n       Nationwide, each U.S. judge handles an average of 87 cases \n     a year. But along the southern border, even before Bush's \n     plan moves forward, the average is around 300 per judge, \n     Carelli said. He added that the two federal judges in Laredo, \n     Texas now carry 1,400 cases apiece.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the \nSenate's historic accomplishment, our imminent passage of bipartisan \nimmigration reform legislation.\n  The immigration reform legislation we are about to pass enhances our \nnational security, promotes our economic well being and creates a fair \nand compassionate path to citizenship for those who came here to work \nhard, pay taxes, respect the law and learn English.\n  The legislation addresses serious problems that have festered for \nyears. Our immigration system has been broken far too long. Some \nthought it was broken beyond repair, but it is not. This Senate reform \nbill stands for the principle that we in government can work together, \non a bipartisan basis, to craft detailed and pragmatic solutions, and \nthat we can avoid strident rhetoric that ultimately gets us nowhere.\n  There are difficult realities we must face. Despite huge increases in \nspending on border security since 1993, the numbers of undocumented \nimmigrants living in the United States has more than doubled, and now \nstands at an estimated 11 million. That number increases significantly \nevery year as more people come here looking for work.\n  We must continue to improve border security. That will require more \nBorder Patrol officers, better technologies, more effective border \nsecurity strategies, and greater expenditures. The bill we are passing \nensures that all of those things will happen. But the flow of illegal \nmigration into the country would continue indefinitely, if our only \nsolution was to continue to increase border security spending.\n  Immigration enforcement is also an essential component of a reform \npackage. Unscrupulous employers who continue to hire and exploit \nundocumented workers must be punished. Once adequate verification \nsystems are in place, employers will have no excuse for hiring \nundocumented workers. The Senate legislation will implement an \neffective verification system, and it will result in the hiring of \nadditional immigration enforcement officers and funding for thousands \nof additional detention beds.\n  But enforcement alone will not solve the major challenges we face. \nLast December the House of Representatives passed a punitive and \nunworkable bill. Their legislation would criminalize the 11 million \nundocumented immigrants living in the U.S., pushing deeper into the \ndarkness those who already live in the shadows and turning Samaritans \nwho offer humanitarian aid into outlaws. Such draconian measures would \ncreate a class of people within our own borders who would live and work \nwithout the protection of law and would be open to exploitation and \ncrime. They would be forced to suffer in silence or risk being \nimprisoned if they came forward.\n  How would that solve the problem? We could never imprison or deport \nmore than a tiny fraction of these millions of people--people who have \nlaid down roots in our communities. If we were to even try, the cost \nwould be prohibitive and would turn our society into something \napproaching a police state.\n  Virtually all of the undocumented immigrants living in this country \ncame here to work hard and support their families. They pay taxes and \nthey respect our laws. They would like nothing better than to become \nmembers of our society, on an equal footing, and pursue the American \ndream like so many immigrants before them. The alternative is keeping \nmillions of families in the shadows, where they can be preyed upon and \nexploited. And by welcoming those hard working and law abiding people, \nwe free up resources we need to seal our borders and pursue the real \ndangers of terrorists, drug traffickers, and other criminals.\n  Undocumented immigrants will not get a free pass to legal residency \nand citizenship. They must earn it. Under the bill, undocumented \nimmigrants who have been present in the U.S. for at least 5 years will \nbe able to apply for a work visa lasting 6 years. They would have to \npay thousands of dollars in fines, clear background checks and then \nmust remain gainfully employed and law abiding. After 6 years of \nworking in the U.S. on a temporary visa, an immigrant could apply for \npermanent residency a process that takes 5 years provided he or she \npaid an additional fee, proved payment of taxes and could show a \nknowledge of English and United States civics. Only after a combined \nperiod of 11 years could the immigrant apply for U.S. citizenship. \nThose who have been here between 2 to 5 years would have to apply \nthrough a stricter guest worker program, and would have to wait even \nlonger before they could win legal residency.\n\n  None of these undocumented immigrants would earn legal residency \nbefore we cleared the backlog of people waiting to receive visas to \nenter the U.S. Immigrants living in the U.S. legally have been waiting \nfar too long to be reunited with their spouses and young children. This \nbill will clear those family reunification backlogs, and undocumented \nimmigrants will have to get in the back of the line.\n  Each component of the plan depends on the others for any of them to \nbe effective, and the new guestworker program that the bill creates is \nan essential component. Even with the provisions I have already \noutlined, we would still face the prospect of future illegal \nimmigration. Currently hundreds of thousands enter the country \nillegally. This illegal migration has fueled a lucrative and extremely \ndangerous market for human smugglers. These smuggling rings war \nviolently against each other, on both sides of the border, and they \nindulge in other illicit traffic. They prey on their human cargo. This \nhas to stop.\n  We are accomplishing nothing if our legislation does not contain \nprovisions addressing future migration flows. The guestworker program \nwill channel future flows through legal avenues. People who want to \ncome here to work will first be screened to ensure that they have \ncommitted no crimes. They can only come if they have legitimate jobs \nwaiting for them.\n  If we don't include a guestworker program, we will continue to see \nhigh rates of illegal immigration in the future. We will have \ntemporarily addressed the large numbers of undocumented immigrants in \nthe U.S., only to see that problem resurface again over time. But with \nthe verification and enforcement provisions I have already described, \nopportunities for undocumented workers will dry up. People will have no \nincentive to illegally enter the U.S. if they know that working here \nwill not be a viable option.\n  Let me address concerns about American workers. I would not support \nany bill that undercuts American workers, and the Senate legislation \ncontains safeguards to protect American workers. Temporary workers will \nnot replace U.S. workers. Employers may\n\n[[Page S5170]]\n\nonly hire temporary workers after they spend 60 days attempting to \nrecruit U.S. workers at the prevailing wage being offered. Temporary \nworkers must be paid at prevailing wages, as defined by the Davis-Bacon \nAct, the Service Contract Act, or collective bargaining agreements. The \nbill contains strong protections to make sure that guestworkers are not \nexploited by labor contractors.\n  These provisions, as well as the wage and working condition \nprotections, are backed up by strong complaint procedures and whistle-\nblower protections. Temporary workers will not be hired in the midst of \na labor dispute and will not be recruited in areas where unemployment \nrates are high. Finally, these protections will be backed up by the \nauthorization of 2,000 new Department of Labor inspectors charged with \nenforcing them.\n  This legislation is far from perfect. The underlying legislation \nalready contained unnecessarily punitive provisions, provisions that \nhave been retained. During Senate consideration of the bill our \nbipartisan majority successfully beat back many measures that would \nhave gutted the bill or unfairly punished immigrants, although I was \ndisappointed by several of the votes on the Senate floor. One example \nwas the adoption of an amendment offered by Senator Inhofe which would \nundermine efforts to provide services for non-English speakers in a \nwide variety of essential governmental functions.\n  I was also disappointed by a setback Senator Brownback and I suffered \nin our attempt to improve our nation's treatment of asylum seekers. In \nFebruary of 2005, the congressionally established U.S. Commission on \nInternational Religious Freedom issued a report that raised serious \nconcerns about insufficient protections for asylum seekers arriving in \nthis country.\n  The problems raised by the Commission's report should shock us, given \nour nation's historic mission as a bastion for those fleeing \npersecution in their home country. The Commission found an unacceptable \nrisk that genuine asylum seekers were being returned to their home \ncountries where they faced repression and worse. This was occurring \nbecause aliens stopped at our airports and borders were not properly \nquestioned about the dangers they would face if they were sent back. \nThis failure to follow procedures required by law resulted in the \ninability of asylum seekers to plead their case.\n  The Commission also found that while asylum seekers are having their \napplications considered, they were often detained for months in \nmaximum-security prisons and jails, without ever having a chance to \nappear before an immigration judge to request bail. While being held, \nsome were subjected to mistreatment or arbitrary punishments, including \nsolitary confinement and the denial of basic medical needs.\n  This kind of treatment of people trying to escape war, oppression--\neven torture--is unacceptable in America. The U.N. High Commissioner \nfor Refugees has repeatedly criticized our detention of asylum seekers \nas inconsistent with U.S. treaty obligations.\n  Since the Commission's report was issued more than a year ago, I have \nroutinely asked officials from the Department of Homeland Security what \nis being done about the problems the Commission identified. For more \nthan a year, I have been assured that the Department was reviewing the \nreport's findings. But in that time the Department did not act to \naddress these shortcomings, nor did it respond to the recommendations \nas I had requested on so many occasions.\n  Because of that long period of inaction, Senator Brownback and I \nintroduced an amendment that would have implemented the Commission's \nmost important recommendations. It called for sensible reforms that \nwould have safeguarded the nation's security while ensuring that people \nfleeing persecution are treated in accordance with this nation's most \nbasic values.\n  Unfortunately, moments before we were to begin debate on our \namendment, the Department of Homeland Security disseminated a position \npaper objecting to our amendment. The Department claimed that \nimplementing the Commission's recommendations would have adverse \nrepercussions on its operational capabilities. These were claims that I \nhad never heard previously, despite my repeated inquiries to the \nhighest Department officials, and they were claims that I believe are \nnot supported by the facts. Nevertheless, we entered into days of \nnegotiations, in which we attempted to address all of the Department's \nconcerns. The negotiations were unavailing.\n  Although unsuccessful on this occasion, Senator Brownback and I \nintend to introduce our amendment as freestanding legislation, so that \nwe can continue to fight to ensure that people who flee oppression and \nseek freedom in America are treated in accordance with our cherished \nvalues. After all, we often say that we are a nation built by \nimmigrants, and that is true, but in many ways we are also a nation \nfounded by refugees.\n  As we pass this historic legislation it is essential that we remember \nthat we are a nation of immigrants and refugees. Throughout the decades \nnew waves of immigrants have arrived. They came from many cultures and \ncountries, they came speaking many different languages, and as they \nsettled here they enriched the nation. All four of my grandparents came \nto this country to pursue a better a life, as did the family of my wife \nHadassah, who was born in Czechoslovakia and arrived here as an infant. \nThe recent immigrants about whom we have been debating these last two \nweeks have come to our country for the same reason that my grandparents \ncame for freedom, opportunity, and a better life for their children.\n  This legislation we pass today will enhance our border security, \nimprove our ability to enforce our immigration laws, and fuel economic \ngrowth. But beyond these reasons, it is also fully in keeping with our \nhistory as a nation of immigrants.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, when the Senate resumed its consideration \nof comprehensive immigration reform last week, I began by expressing my \nhope that we would finish the job the Judiciary Committee started in \nMarch and the Senate began in April. We need to fix the broken \nimmigration system with tough reforms that secure our borders and with \nreforms that will bring millions of undocumented immigrants out of the \nshadows. I have said all along that Democratic Senators cannot pass a \nfair and comprehensive bill alone. Over the last 2 weeks we finally got \nsome help. I would like to especially thank Senators Kennedy and \nMcCain, as well as Chairman Specter and the Democratic leader, for \ntheir tireless work on this bill.\n  We got some words of encouragement from President Bush last week when \nhe began speaking out more forcefully and in more specific terms about \nall of the components needed for comprehensive legislation. For the \nfirst time, he expressly endorsed a pathway to earned citizenship for \nthe millions of undocumented workers now here. I thank him for joining \nin this effort. But his work is far from done. We will need his \ninfluence with the recalcitrant members of his party here in the House \nif we are ultimately to be successful in our legislative effort. \nWithout effective intervention of the President, this effort is \nunlikely to be successful and the prospects for securing our borders \nand dealing with the hopes of millions who now live in the shadows of \nour society will be destroyed. Those who have peacefully demonstrated \ntheir dedication to justice and comprehensive immigration reform should \nnot be relegated back into the shadows.\n  Yesterday we were able to begin to draw to a close the Republican \nfilibuster against comprehensive immigration reform. When Republicans \nfilibustered two cloture votes last month, including one on a motion by \nthe Republican leader, I was disappointed. I had hoped we would \nrecognize the lawful, heartfelt protests of millions against the harsh \nHouse-passed criminalization measures. While they waved American flags, \nsome of those fueling anti-immigrant feelings burned flags of other \ncountries. I am encouraged that through the course of this debate we \nhave been able to convince enough Senate Republicans to join us in our \nefforts and to appreciate the contributions of immigrants to our \neconomy and our Nation.\n  This bill is not all that it should be in my view. By incorporating \nthe Hagel-Martinez formulation, we have compromised from the initial \ncompromise. I have made no secret that I\n\n[[Page S5171]]\n\npreferred the better outline of the Judiciary Committee bill. The bill \nthe Senate is now considering is a further compromise. Debate and \namendments have added some improvements as well as some significant \nsteps in the wrong direction. I thank Senators Bingaman, Kerry, Obama, \nSalazar, and others for their important and constructive amendments. I \nwas delighted that after some initial opposition, working with Senator \nStevens and others, we were able to add flexibility to the Western \nHemisphere Travel Initiative by extending its deadline another year and \none-half through our amendment.\n  The Senate unwisely rejected efforts by some of us to make it more \nflexible for those persecuted around the world. This country has had a \nhistory of being welcoming to refugees and those seeking asylum from \npersecution. The Senate turned its back on that history by refusing to \nallow the Secretary of State the flexibility needed after restrictive \nlanguage was added to our laws by the REAL ID Act. I remain hopeful \nthat Senators will reconsider these issues with more open minds and \nhearts and a fully understanding of the lives being affected. Sadly, \ntoo many were spooked by false arguments.\n  Besides the Senate's failure to readjust asylum provisions to take \ninto account the realities of oppressive forces in many parts of the \nworld, I was most disappointed that the Senate appeared to be so anti-\nHispanic in its adoption of the Inhofe English language amendment.\n  Senator Salazar and I wrote to the President following up on this \nprovision and the comments of the Attorney General last week and \nweekend. We asked whether the President will continue to implement the \nlanguage outreach policies of President Clinton's Executive Order \n13166. A prompt and straightforward affirmative answer can go a long \nway toward rendering the Inhofe English amendment a symbolic stain \nrather than a serious impediment to immigrants and Americans for whom \nEnglish at this moment in their lives is a second language.\n  I deeply regret that the Senate took such a divisive act. Over my \nstrong objection and that of the Democratic leader, Senator Salazar, \nand others, a modified version of the Inhofe amendment was adopted. I \nunderstand why this amendment provoked a reaction from the Latino \ncommunity as exemplified by the May 19 letter from the League of United \nLatin American Citizens, the Mexican American Legal Defense and \nEducational Fund, the National Association of Latino Elected Officials \nEducational Fund, the National Council of La Raza, the National Puerto \nRican Coalition, and from a larger coalition of interested parties from \n96 national and local organizations.\n  Until this week, in our previous 230 years we have not found it \nnecessary or wise to adopt English as our official or national \nlanguage. I believe it was in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that the \nState legislature shortly after the Revolutionary War authorized \nofficial publication of Pennsylvania's laws in German as well as \nEnglish to serve the German-speaking population of that State. We have \nbeen a confident Nation unafraid to hear expressions in a variety of \nlanguages and willing to reach out to all within our borders. That \ntradition is reflected in President Clinton's Executive Order 13166.\n  We demean our history and our welcoming tradition when we disparage \nSpanish and those who come to us speaking Spanish. I have spoken about \nour including Latin phrases on our official seal and the many States \nthat include mottos and phrases in Latin, French, and Spanish on their \nState flags. We need not fear other languages. We would do better to do \nmore to encourage and assist those who wish to be citizens to learn \nEnglish, but we should recognize English, as Senator Salazar's \namendment suggested, as our common and unifying language.\n  Yesterday, once we had overcome the previous Republican filibuster, \nwe were faced with a budget point of order supported by some Senators \nwho oppose the bill and who added significantly to the costs of the \nbill through their amendments. Rather than continue their efforts to \ndelay or derail Senate action on comprehensive immigration reform, I \nhad hoped that they would join with us in a constructive way to enact \ncomprehensive immigration reform. We do not need more divisiveness, \nderision, and obstruction.\n  This bill is not the bill I would have designed. It includes many \nfeatures I do not support and fails to include many that I do. The bill \nthat won the bipartisan support of a majority of the Judiciary \nCommittee was a compromise that contained the essential components that \nare required for comprehensive immigration reform. Before the last \nrecess I was willing to support a further compromise that incorporated \nthe principles of the Hagel-Martinez bill because it was proposed by \nthe majority leader as a ``breakthrough'' that would allow us to pass \nimmigration reform.\n  I want to express my appreciation to the Democratic leader, Senator \nReid. He was right to insist that the original version of the Kyl-\nCornyn amendment and the Isakson amendment not be rushed through the \nSenate to score political points. As the significantly revised version \nof the Kyl-Cornyn amendment attests, the Democratic leader was right. \nWith a little time, and thanks to a lot of hard work, the amendment has \nbeen significantly changed, narrowed, and accepted. With a little time \nand bipartisan commitment the Isakson amendment was defeated.\n  We have proceeded to consider dozens of amendments. Most have been \noffered by Republican Senators. Some have been approved; some have been \ntabled or rejected. The Senate has worked its will.\n  Immigration reform must be comprehensive if it is to lead to real \nsecurity and real reform. Enforcement-only measures may sound tough, \nbut they are insufficient. The Senate has a responsibility to pass a \nbill that addresses our broken system with comprehensive reform and \nputs the pieces in place to secure the Nation.\n  Just a few weeks ago, I went to the White House with a bipartisan \ndelegation of Senators to speak with the President. The need for a fair \nand comprehensive immigration bill was the consensus at that meeting, \nand I believe the President was sincere when he told us that we had his \nsupport. I trust that he will urge comprehensive immigration reform on \nthe Republican House leadership who has yet to endorse our bipartisan \ncomprehensive approach. Without the President following through on his \nwords with actions, the effort for comprehensive immigration reform is \nunlikely to be successful.\n  Last week the Senate made progress. We made progress because \nDemocratic and Republican Senators working together rejected the most \nstrident attacks on the comprehensive bill. We joined together in a \nbipartisan coalition in the Judiciary Committee when we reported the \nJudiciary Committee bill. Democratic Senators were ready to join \ntogether in April and supported the Republican leader's motion that \nwould have resulted in incorporating features from the Hagel-Martinez \nbill, but Republicans balked at that time and continued to filibuster \naction. Last week, Republicans joined with us to defend the core \nprovisions of that bill, and we defeated efforts by Senators Kyl and \nCornyn to gut the guest worker provisions and to undermine the pathway \nto earned citizenship. Instead, we adopted the Bingaman amendment to \ncap the annual guest worker program at 200,000 and the Obama amendment \nregarding prevailing wages in order to better protect the opportunities \nand wages of American workers.\n  I spoke last week about the need to strengthen our border security \nafter more than 5 years of neglect and failure by the Bush-Cheney \nadministration. A recent report concluded that the number of people \napprehended at our borders for illegal entry fell 31 percent on \nPresident Bush's watch, from a yearly average of 1.52 million between \n1996 and 2000, to 1.05 million between 2001 and 2004. The number of \nillegal immigrants apprehended while in the interior of the country \ndeclined 36 percent, from a yearly average of roughly 40,000 between \n1996 and 2000, to 25,901 between 2001 and 2004. Audits and fines \nagainst employers of illegal immigrants have also fallen significantly \nsince President Bush took office. Given the vast increases in the \nnumber of Border Patrol agents, the decline in enforcement can only be \nexplained by a failure of leadership.\n  Meanwhile, once again the administration is turning to the fine men \nand\n\n[[Page S5172]]\n\nwomen of National Guard. After our intervention turned sour in Iraq, \nthe Pentagon turned to the Guard. After the Government-wide failure in \nresponding to Hurricane Katrina, we turned to the Guard. Now, the \nadministration's longstanding lack of focus on our porous southern \nborder and failure to develop a comprehensive immigration policy has \nprompted the administration to turn once again to the Guard. I remain \npuzzled that this administration, which seems so ready to take \nadvantage of the Guard, fights so vigorously against providing this \nessential force with adequate equipment, a seat at the table in policy \ndebates, or even adequate health insurance for the men and women of the \nGuard.\n  I have cautioned that any Guard units should operate under the \nauthority of State Governors. In addition, the Federal Government \nshould pick up the full costs of such a deployment. Those costs should \nnot be foisted onto the States and their already overtaxed Guard units.\n  Controlling our borders is a national responsibility, and it is \nregrettable that so much of this duty has been punted to the States and \nnow to the Guard. The Guard is pitching in above and beyond, balancing \nits already demanding responsibilities to the States, while sending \ntroops who have been deployed to Iraq. The Guard served admirably in \nresponse to Hurricane Katrina when the Federal Government failed to \nprepare or respond in a timely or sufficient manner. The Vermont Guard \nand others have been contributing to our national security since the \nimmediate aftermath of 9/11. After 5 years of failing to utilize the \nauthority and funding Congress has provided to strengthen the Border \nPatrol and our border security, the administration is, once again, \nturning to the National Guard.\n  It was instructive that last week President Bush and congressional \nRepublicans staged a bill-signing for legislation that continues \nbillions of dollars of tax cuts for the wealthy. Instead of a budget \nwith robust and complete funding for our Border Patrol and border \nsecurity, the President has focused on providing tax cuts for the \nwealthiest among us. Congress has had to step in time and again to \ncreate new border agent positions and direct that they be filled. \nInstead of urging his party to take early and decisive action to pass \ncomprehensive immigration reform, as he signaled he would in February \n2001, the President began his second term campaigning to undercut the \nprotections of our Social Security system, and the American people \nsignaled their opposition to those undermining steps. While the \nPresident talks about the importance of our first responders, he has \nproposed 67 percent cuts in the grant program that supplies bulletproof \nvests to police officers.\n\n  Five years of the Bush-Cheney administration's inaction and misplaced \npriorities have done nothing to improve our immigration situation. The \nSenate just passed an emergency supplemental appropriations bill that \nallocated nearly $2 billion from military accounts to border security. \nThe Democratic leader had proposed that the funds not be taken from the \ntroops. But last week the President sent a request for diverting a like \namount of funding, intended for capital improvements for border \nsecurity, into operations and deployment of the National Guard. The \nRepublican chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on \nHomeland Security came to the Senate Floor last week to give an \nextraordinary speech in this regard.\n  Border security alone is not enough to solve our immigration \nproblems. We must pass a bill--and enact a law--that will not only \nstrengthen the security along our borders, but that will also encourage \nmillions of people to come out of the shadows. When this is \naccomplished we will be more secure because we will know who is living \nand working in the United States. We must encourage the undocumented to \ncome forward, undergo background checks, and pay taxes to earn a place \non the path to citizenship.\n  In addition, last week the Senate adopted a billion-dollar amendment \nto build fencing along the southern border without saying how it would \nbe funded. We also adopted amendments by Senators Bingaman, Kerry, and \nNelson of Florida to strengthen our enforcement efforts.\n  Last week we defeated an Ensign amendment to deny persons in legal \nstatus the Social Security benefits to which they are fairly entitled. \nI believe that most Americans will agree with that decision as fair and \njust. It maintains the trust of the Social Security trust fund for \nthose workers who contribute to the fund. This week we defeated a \nSessions amendment that would have unfairly stripped immigrants of \nearned-income tax credits. I am pleased that in both cases the Senate \nagreed not to unfairly withhold these benefits from hard-working \nimmigrants who will benefit immensely from them.\n  The opponents of our bipartisan bill have made a number of assaults \non our comprehensive approach. Senators Kyl, Sessions, and Cornyn \nopposed the Judiciary Committee bill. Senators Vitter, Ensign, \nChambliss, and Inhofe have been very active in the amendment process, \nas well. I hope that they recognize how fairly they have been treated \nand the time they have been given to argue their case against the bill \nand offer amendments. We have adopted their amendments where possible. \nA narrowed version of the Kyl-Cornyn amendment disqualifying some from \nseeking legalization was adopted. The Sessions amendment on fencing was \nadopted. The Vitter amendment on documents was adopted. The Ensign \namendment on the National Guard was adopted. The Cornyn amendment \nimposing additional costs on immigrants was adopted.\n  I trust that with so many of their amendments having been fairly \nconsidered and some having been adopted, those in the opposition to \nthis measure will reevaluate their previous filibuster. It may be too \nmuch to think that they will support the bill as amended.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 2611, the \nComprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006.\n  This is not a perfect bill. It is a compromise. I strongly support \nsome provisions of this bill and I have serious concerns about others, \nbut, on balance, I believe it is worthy of support.\n  If we want to solve the problem of illegal immigration, we must take \na comprehensive approach. We must secure our border, strengthen \nenforcement of our immigration laws, and address the situation of \napproximately 12 million undocumented immigrants who live and work in \nour country. In the final analysis, this bill does all of these things \nand that is why I will support it.\n  I want to express my gratitude to Senator McCain and Senator Kennedy \nfor their steadfast leadership of our bipartisan coalition for \nimmigration reform. I also want to salute Senator Specter, the chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee, and Senator Leahy, the ranking member of \nthe Judiciary Committee, for shepherding this bill to the verge of \npassage.\n  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, and a supporter of the \nbipartisan McCain-Kennedy immigration reform legislation, I have been \nvery involved in the debate over this bill for the past several months.\n  The process of drafting this bill began in the Judiciary Committee in \nearly March. We engaged in a serious, substantive debate. There was \ndisagreement on some points, but the discussion was always respectful. \nWe considered dozens of amendments during several marathon committee \nmeetings. At the end of the process, we approved a tough, fair, and \ncomprehensive bill on a strong bipartisan vote.\n  We have seen a similar process on the floor of Senate. We have \ndebated this legislation for several weeks. By my count, we have had \nover 30 roll call votes on amendments to this bill. It is rare for us \nto devote this much time and energy to a single piece of legislation. \nIt demonstrates that the Senate takes the subject of immigration very \nseriously. And it is reflected in the quality of the final product.\n  As I said earlier, this bill includes provisions that I oppose and \nthose that I support. Let me first mention some of the provisions of \nthis bill that concern me most.\n  This bill includes an Inhofe amendment that declares English to be \nthe national language of the United States. Unfortunately, the \namendment goes beyond that. It includes sweeping language that some \nfear will call into question the validity of controlling Executive \nOrders and regulations.\n  I am especially concerned that we not undermine Executive Order \n13166,\n\n[[Page S5173]]\n\nwhich requires Federal agencies to provide meaningful access to \nGovernment services for people who have limited proficiency in English. \nThis Executive Order protects all of our safety and well-being by \nensuring that limited English proficient Americans understand vital \ninformation that the Government provides, particularly in the event of \na natural disaster or a threat to national security. The threat to \nExecutive Order 13166 is one reason why dozens of national Latino and \ncivil rights organizations oppose the Inhofe amendment.\n  Senator Salazar and I authored an amendment declaring that, ``English \nis the common and unifying language of the United States that helps \nprovide unity for the people of the United States.'' In contrast to the \nInhofe amendment, the amendment that Senator Salazar and I offered \nmakes it explicit that nothing in our amendment ``shall diminish or \nexpand any existing rights under the law of the United States.'' The \nSenate approved our amendment on a strong bipartisan vote.\n  There is no disagreement on this principle. It is very difficult to \nbe successful in this country if you do not speak English. Throughout \nAmerican history, immigrants have come to the United States and learned \nEnglish. That process continues. According to the Urban Institute, \nnearly 40 percent of immigrant children have limited proficiency in \nEnglish, but by the second generation, only about 20 percent have \nlimited proficiency, and by the third generation children, that number \nfalls to .5 percent. The U.S. Census found that 92 percent of Americans \n``had no difficulty speaking English;'' 82 percent of Americans speak \nonly English at home; and most people who speak a language other than \nEnglish also speak English ``very well.''\n  Unfortunately, many immigrants who want to learn English have few \nopportunities to do so. There are waiting lists of thousands of \nimmigrants for English as a second language classes in cities around \nthe country. We should be creating more opportunities for immigrants to \nlearn English. The Inhofe amendment would not do that. Instead, it has \nthe potential to marginalize immigrants and make it more difficult for \nthem to access vital government services.\n  Both the Inhofe and the Salazar-Durbin amendments are in this bill. \nIn the conference committee, we must clarify that Congress does not \nintend to overturn controlling Executive Orders or regulations, \nparticularly Executive Order 13166.\n  I am disappointed that my Republican colleagues rejected an amendment \nthat I offered that would have authorized the Attorney General or \nSecretary of Homeland Security to grant a humanitarian waiver to an \nimmigrant if deportation of the immigrant would create extreme hardship \nfor an immediate family member of the immigrant who is a U.S. citizen \nor legal permanent resident.\n  We need to strengthen enforcement of our immigration laws in order to \nrestore integrity to our immigration system. As we make our laws \ntougher, we must ensure that we stay true to American values. I am \nconcerned that some of the enforcement provisions in this bill are so \nbroad that they will have unintended consequences. These provisions \nhave the potential to sweep up long-term legal permanent residents and \nseparate them from their immediate family members.\n  My amendment would have created a limited waiver that would have \napplied only in the most compelling cases--where deportation of an \nimmediate family member would create extreme hardship for an American \ncitizen or legal permanent resident.\n  The waiver would not be automatic. In every case, the immigrant would \nhave to demonstrate that he meets the ``extreme hardship'' standard. In \nevery case, the government would have ``sole and unreviewable \ndiscretion'' to deny a waiver.\n  This is the same strict standard that Senators Kyl and Cornyn used in \nan amendment we approved last week by a unanimous vote. The Kyl-Cornyn \nwaiver would apply in cases where undocumented immigrants are seeking \nlegal status. The waiver in my amendment would apply in cases where an \nimmigrant who was previously in legal status is subject to deportation \nbecause of a change in the law made by this bill.\n  It seems inconsistent to give a chance for a humanitarian waiver to \nan undocumented immigrant and not give the same chance to a legal \nimmigrant. I hope that the conference committee will revisit this issue \nand resolve this inconsistency by extending the humanitarian waiver for \nundocumented immigrants to legal immigrants who face deportation \nbecause of changes in the law made in this bill.\n  We already give the Government broad discretion to apprehend, detain \nand deport immigrants. We should also give the Government some limited \ndiscretion to show mercy in the most compelling cases.\n  I am also very disappointed that the Senate approved a Gregg \namendment that would effectively gut the Diversity Visa Program, \nthreaten the jobs of Americans, and exacerbate the ``brain drain''--the \nmigration of talent from the poorest countries in the world to the \nrichest.\n  Congress created the Diversity Visa Program to provide immigration \nopportunities for people from countries with low levels of immigration \nto the United States. Diversity visas open the door to thousands of \npeople from around the world who could otherwise never aspire to the \nAmerican Dream. The program helps to ensure that the United States \ncontinues to be the most diverse country in the world.\n  The Gregg amendment would fundamentally alter the Diversity Visa \nProgram by setting aside two-thirds of diversity visas for immigrants \nwho hold advanced degrees in science, mathematics, technology, and \nengineering. These set-asides would favor immigrants from wealthier \ncountries and reduce the diversity of future immigration to our \ncountry.\n  By bringing more high-skilled immigrants to the United States, the \nGregg amendment will also increase competition for highly sought-after \nAmerican jobs. For the same reason, I am concerned that this bill would \nincrease the annual number of H-1B visas to 115,000 and allow that cap \nto increase every year if American companies use all of the available \nvisas in a given year. Some experts argue that the H-1B program is \nalready taking jobs away from Americans.\n  I am also very concerned that the Gregg amendment would exacerbate \nthe ``brain drain.''\n  And unfortunately, this bill includes another provision that will \nincrease the brain drain by lifting the annual cap on the number of \nnurses who can immigrate to our country every year. A story in \nyesterday's New York Times on this provision, headlined, ``U.S. Plan to \nLure Nurses May Hurt Poor Nations,'' reports:\n\n       A little-noticed provision in [the Senate] immigration bill \n     would throw open the gate to nurses and, some fear, drain \n     them from the world's developing countries . . . The exodus \n     of nurses from poor to rich countries has strained health \n     systems in the developing world, which are already facing \n     severe shortages of their own. . . . Public health experts in \n     poor countries, told about the proposal in recent days, \n     reacted with dismay and outrage, coupled with doubts that \n     their nurses would resist the magnetic pull of the United \n     States, which sits at the pinnacle of the global labor market \n     for nurses.\n\n  Later I will address a provision in this bill that will take modest \nbut important steps to begin to address this brain drain, but we must \ndo much more.\n  I am also disappointed that the Senate approved an amendment \nrequiring construction of a 370-mile wall on the Southern border. We \nneed to secure our border, and this bill includes literally dozens of \nprovisions to do so. Among other measures, we double the size of the \nborder patrol and we mandate the use of new technology to create a \n``virtual fence'' at the border.\n  A wall will not secure our border. The reality is that no wall will \nprevent illegal immigration. There will always be a way around, over, \nor under a wall. In fact, experts estimate that 40 percent of \nundocumented immigrants enter the country legally and then overstay \ntheir visas. No wall will stop visa overstays.\n  Constructing a wall will be very expensive. It will make life more \ndifficult for innocent Americans in border communities, including noise \nand light pollution. It has the potential to do great harm to \nenvironmentally sensitive border areas. Most important, a wall will \nsend the wrong message to the rest of the world about the United \nStates.\n\n[[Page S5174]]\n\n  Now I would like to focus on the positive in this bill, especially \nmeasures with which I was personally involved.\n  This legislation includes the DREAM Act, a narrowly-tailored, \nbipartisan measure that I sponsored with Senator Hagel and Senator \nLugar. The DREAM Act would give undocumented students the chance to \nbecome permanent residents if they came here as children, are long-term \nU.S. residents, have good moral character, and attend college or enlist \nin the military for at least 2 years.\n  Currently our immigration laws prevent thousands of young people from \npursuing their dreams and fully contributing to our Nation's future. \nThey are honor-roll students, star athletes, talented artists, \nvaledictorians, and aspiring teachers and doctors. These young people \nhave lived in this country for most of their lives. It is the only home \nthey know. They are assimilated and acculturated into American society. \nThey are American in every sense except their technical legal status.\n  And they have beaten the odds in their young lives. The high school \ndropout rate among undocumented immigrants is 50 percent, compared to \n21 percent for legal immigrants and 11 percent for native-born \nAmericans. These children have demonstrated the kind of determination \nand commitment that makes them successful students and points the way \nto the significant contributions they will make in their lives. These \nchildren are tomorrow's doctors, nurses, teachers, policemen, \nfirefighters, soldiers, and Senators.\n  The DREAM Act would help these students. It is not an amnesty. It is \ndesigned to assist only a select group of young people who have done \nnothing wrong and who would be required to earn their way to legal \nstatus.\n  The DREAM Act offers no incentive for undocumented immigrants to \nenter the country. In fact, it requires beneficiaries to have been in \nthe country for at least 5 years on the date of enactment.\n  The DREAM Act would also repeal a provision of Federal law that \nprevents States from granting in-State tuition rates to undocumented \nstudents. It would not create any new tuition breaks. It would not \nforce States to offer in-State tuition to undocumented immigrants. It \nwould simply return to States the authority to determine their own \ntuition policies.\n  The DREAM Act is not just the right thing to do, it is good for \nAmerica. The DREAM Act would allow a generation of immigrant students \nwith great potential and ambitions to contribute more fully to our \nsociety.\n  The DREAM Act is supported by a broad bipartisan coalition in the \nSenate, and by religious leaders, immigrant advocates, and educators \nfrom across the political spectrum and around the country. Our \ncoalition will fight to ensure that the DREAM Act is included in the \nconference report.\n  I am also very pleased that we were able to remove some of the bill's \nharshest provisions during the Judiciary Committee markup.\n  The original version of this bill would have taken the unprecedented \nstep of criminalizing people based solely on their immigration status. \nThat is not the way we should treat immigrants in our country. And that \nis not the way our criminal justice system works. We punish people for \ntheir conduct, not their status.\n  Criminalizing immigrants will not help us to combat illegal \nimmigration. Our Government does not have the time or resources to \nprosecute and incarcerate 12 million people. Enacting yet another law \nthat would not be enforced will not solve the problem of illegal \nimmigration. In fact, it would make the problem worse.\n  If we make undocumented immigrants into criminals, we will drive them \nfurther into the shadows. This will harm our national security because \nwe will be unable to identify who is in our country.\n  This is also a moral issue. We are measured by how we treat the most \nvulnerable among us. It is not right to make criminals of millions of \npeople who go to work every day cooking our food, cleaning our hotel \nrooms, and caring for our children and our parents. It is not right to \nmake criminals of those who worship with us in our churches, send their \nchildren to school with our own and love this great and free land as \nmuch as any of us.\n  During the Judiciary Committee markup, I offered an amendment to \nstrike the provision that would have criminalized undocumented \nimmigrants. My amendment was approved by a strong bipartisan vote, and \nas a result that provision is not in the bill we are considering today.\n  The original version of this bill also included a provision that \nwould make it a crime for innocent Americans to provide humanitarian \nassistance to undocumented immigrants. This provision stated that it \nwould constitute alien smuggling, an aggravated felony to ``encourage \nor induce a person to . . . remain in the United States, knowing or in \nreckless disregard of the fact that such person is an alien who lacks \nlawful authority.''\n  This language is so broad and vague that it could conceivably \nconstitute an aggravated felony for a priest to counsel an undocumented \nmother to stay in the United States with her U.S. citizen children, \nrather than abandoning them to return to her home country. And a \ndomestic violence shelter that takes in a battered immigrant spouse \nwithout asking whether or not she has a green card could be guilty of \nalien smuggling.\n  Americans honor our heritage as a Nation of immigrants by welcoming \nand caring for new arrivals in our country. We should thank them for \ntheir service, not prosecute them.\n  The original version of the bill included an exception for \nhumanitarian assistance, but it was far too narrow. It only would have \nprotected individuals, not organizations, like churches, hospitals, \nschools, or unions. It would only have applied to ``emergency \nhumanitarian assistance,'' not aid that is provided in non-emergency \nsituations. It only would apply to assistance that is ``rendered \nwithout compensation or the expectation of compensation.'' And it would \nonly cover humanitarian assistance, not other types of lawful activity \nlike labor organizing.\n  Charitable organizations, like individuals, should be able to provide \nhumanitarian assistance to immigrants without fearing prosecution. \nChurches, shelters, and schools should not be limited to providing only \n``emergency'' assistance. A domestic violence shelter should not be \nforced to decide whether the Government would regard a situation as \n``an emergency'' before they take in a battered woman. A non-profit \nhospital should not be required to provide medical care without \ncompensation in order to avoid criminal prosecution. And labor unions \nshould be able to organize workers without checking their green cards.\n  During the Judiciary Committee markup, I offered an amendment to this \nprovision which was approved on a strong bipartisan vote. My amendment \nexpanded the humanitarian exception to cover organizations. It made it \nexplicit that humanitarian assistance includes, but is not limited to, \nhousing, counseling, and victim services. It eliminated the provisions \nthat limit the humanitarian assistance exception to emergency \nsituations and to assistance that is rendered without compensation.\n  My amendment also eliminated the provision that would have made it a \ncrime to encourage or induce an undocumented immigrant to ``remain in'' \nthis country. As a result, the law remains the same: it is not a crime \nto engage in activities like labor organizing with undocumented \nimmigrants, which could conceivably be construed by an overzealous \nprosecutor to constitute encouraging someone to remain in the United \nStates.\n  Unfortunately, H.R. 4437, the immigration bill passed by the \nRepublican-controlled House of Representatives, still includes \nprovisions that would criminalize hard-working immigrants and good \nSamaritans who provide humanitarian assistance to immigrants. This is \nan issue that I will monitor very closely. A conference report that \ncriminalizes millions of undocumented immigrants and the innocent \nAmericans who care for them will be unacceptable to me and many other \nSenators on both sides of the aisle.\n  This bill includes an amendment I offered to address a critical \ninternational problem: the dire shortage of healthcare personnel in the \nleast developed nations of the world. Shortages of healthcare personnel \nare a global problem, but the brain drain of doctors, nurses, and other \nhealth workers from\n\n[[Page S5175]]\n\nthe poorest countries in the world to the richest is an urgent problem. \nAccording to the World Health Organization, Africa loses 20,000 health \nprofessionals a year as part of this brain drain. In Ethiopia, for \nexample, there are now only 3 doctors and 20 nurses per 100,000 people. \nBy comparison, there are 549 doctors and 773 nurses per 100,000 people \nin the United States. Experts say the shortage of health care personnel \nis the single biggest obstacle to fighting HIV/AIDS in Africa.\n  My amendment would take two measured steps to address the brain \ndrain.\n  In exchange for financial support for their education or training, \nsome foreign doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers have signed \nvoluntary bonds or made promises to their governments to remain in \ntheir home countries or to return from their studies abroad and work in \nthe healthcare profession.\n  The Durbin amendment will require people who are applying for legal \npermanent residency or for visas to work as health care workers in the \nUnited States to attest that they do not have an outstanding commitment \nto perform healthcare work in their home country that they have \nincurred in exchange for support for their education or training.\n  If an applicant has made such a commitment as part of a voluntary \nagreement, the applicant would be inadmissible until he or she has \nfulfilled this commitment. This will enable underdeveloped countries to \nbenefit from the investments they have made in their citizens' medical \neducation and training, and it will ensure that U.S. immigration policy \nrespects commitments that immigrants have made. The Secretary of \nHomeland Security would be able to waive this requirement in certain \ncompelling circumstances.\n  The amendment will also allow healthcare workers who are legal \npermanent residents of this country to provide healthcare assistance in \ndeveloping countries for up to 36 months without prejudicing their own \nimmigration status. During the period when the healthcare worker is \nproviding assistance, he or she would be deemed to be physically \npresent in the U.S. for purposes of naturalization.\n  Many immigrants who have come to this country would like to \nparticipate in the fight against global AIDS and other health crises. \nUnder my amendment, they could lend their skills to developing nations \nwithout sacrificing their own American dreams.\n  These small but important steps will not stop the brain drain, but \nthey will signal American leadership in the effort to help stem the \nmigration of talent from the poorest countries in the world to the \nrichest.\n  I am also pleased that this bill includes important reforms to the \nimmigration court system that will improve the quality of judicial \ndecision-making and help to protect due process.\n  Just as important, the bill does not include provisions from the \noriginal version of this bill that would have undermined judicial \nreview of immigration appeals.\n  One provision would have stripped Federal appellate courts of their \njurisdiction over immigration appeals and redirected these appeals to \nthe Federal Circuit Court, a small specialized court whose caseload \nconsists largely of patent Federal personnel, and Government contract \ncases.\n  Another would have assigned all immigration appeals to a single \nFederal Circuit judge, who would have acted as a gatekeeper to full \nappellate review. Unless this single judge issued a so-called \n``certificate of reviewability,'' the appeal would be denied.\n  In recent years, Federal appeals courts judges around the country \nhave been outspoken about the serious problems with our immigration \ncourt system.\n  Take the example of Judge Richard Posner, a highly-respected \nconservative who sits on the 7th Circuit in my home state of Illinois. \nLast year, Judge Posner issued an opinion in which he concluded, quote, \n``the adjudication of [immigration] cases at the administrative level \nhas fallen below the minimum standards of legal justice.''\n  After I reviewed the troubling provisions in the original version of \nthis bill, I asked Judge Posner for his reaction to them. Judge Posner \nsent me a letter, which I circulated to the members of the Judiciary \nCommittee. In his letter, Judge Posner concludes, ``Funneling all \npetitions for judicial review of [immigration] orders to the Federal \nCircuit and authorizing single judges of that court to deny petitions \nwithout further review are neither just nor effective solutions.''\n  In the aftermath of Judge Posner's letter, others stepped forward. \nThe Judicial Conference, the policy-making arm of the Federal \nJudiciary, expressed their opposition to these provisions. John Walker, \na Republican appointee who is the Chief Judge of the 2nd Circuit wrote \nin opposition to these provisions, concluding, ``Reassigning petitions \nfor review to the Federal Circuit and allowing their disposal by only \none judge will neither reduce the backlog more efficiently, nor protect \nthe aliens' entitlement to adequate review. Indeed the reverse is \nlikely.'' Dozens of other sitting and retired appellate judges, law \nschool deans and professors expressed similar views.\n  In fact, as the Judicial Conference explains, the Fed. appeals courts \nare making progress in clearing the existing backlog of immigration \nappeals: ``These courts have worked diligently to establish court \nmanagement procedures to assist them in effectively and efficiently \nhandling these cases. These measures are enabling the courts to process \nsignificantly larger numbers of cases than in prior years.''\n  Judges and scholars have concluded that the solution to the problems \nin our immigration courts is to increase their capacity. As Judge \nPosner says, ``The only just and effective way of alleviating the \nburden of immigration appeals is by greatly augmenting the decisional \ncapacity of the Immigration Court and the Board of Immigration \nAppeals.''\n  Similarly, Judge Walker concludes, ``The principal problem with the \ncurrent system is that both the Immigration Judges and the BIA are \nimpossibly overtaxed... I firmly believe the most effective and sound \nway of addressing this problem is by allocating sufficient resources to \nexpand the capability of the Department of Justice, rather than \naltering the procedures for judicial review.''\n  After considering the input of Judge Posner and other judges and \nscholars, I decided to offer an amendment to strike the provisions that \nwould consolidate immigration appeals to the Federal Circuit Court and \ngive a single judge the power to deny an immigration appeal. In \nresponse, Chairman Specter decided to remove these provisions from the \noriginal bill and they are not in the bill that we are considering \ntoday.\n  As judges and scholars advised us, the bill does include provisions \nthat would bolster the capacity of the immigration courts by, among \nother things, increasing the number of immigration judges and members \nof the Board of Immigration Appeals. I hope that the conference \ncommittee retains these improvements.\n  Most important, this bill takes a comprehensive approach that is \ntough but fair. We would improve our border security by increasing \nmanpower and deploying new technology. We would crack down on the \nemployers that are hiring millions of undocumented workers.\n  We need tougher enforcement, but in this bill we acknowledge \nsomething that the House of Representatives' bill does not: A strategy \nthat focuses only on enforcement is doomed to failure.\n  In the last decade, we have doubled the number of Border Patrol \nagents and they have spent eight times as many hours patrolling the \nborder. During the same period, the number of undocumented immigrants \nhas doubled.\n  We need a realistic and reasonable approach to address the 12 million \nundocumented immigrants living here today.\n  As the Department of Homeland Security acknowledges, mass deportation \nis not an option. It is impractical and too expensive. Experts estimate \nthat deporting all of the undocumented would cost over $200 billion--\nthat's five times the annual budget of DHS.\n  Amnesty is not an option. It is not right to reward those who have \nbroken the law with automatic citizenship.\n  If we are serious about reform, we need to offer a chance for \nimmigrants who work hard and play by the rules to earn their way to \ncitizenship over the course of many years.\n\n[[Page S5176]]\n\n  Some people claim this is an amnesty. But under the Judiciary \nCommittee bill, undocumented aliens can earn their way to citizenship \nonly if they have a clean criminal record, have been employed since \nbefore January 2004, remain continuously employed going forward, pay a \nlarge fine, pass a security background check, pass a medical exam, \nlearn English, learn U.S. history and government, pay all back taxes, \nand go to the ``back of line'' behind all applicants waiting for green \ncards.\n  This is an II-year path to earned citizenship, not an amnesty.\n  Frankly, if we do not give people the chance to earn their way to \ncitizenship, we will not solve the problem of illegal immigration. \nPeople who are living here illegally will stay in the shadows instead \nof coming forward to register. This would hurt our national security \nand hurt American workers, who are being undercut by illegal labor.\n  And it is not the American way. It is important to remember that this \nis not just a national security issue and an economic issue--it is also \na moral issue. Scripture teaches us to treat immigrants as we would \nlike to be treated: ``The strangers who sojourn with you shall be to \nyou as the natives among you, and you shall love them as yourself, for \nyou were strangers in the land of Egypt.'' That is why the Catholic \nChurch and so many other faith communities support comprehensive \nimmigration reform that includes a path to citizenship for hardworking \nimmigrants who play by the rules.\n  Today is a historic day in the United States Senate, but there is \nstill one more bridge to cross. We must reconcile this bill, which \ntakes a comprehensive approach, with the harsh enforcement-only \nlegislation passed by the Republican-controlled House of \nRepresentatives. The President says he supports comprehensive reform. \nNow he must exercise leadership to make it a reality.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the comprehensive \nimmigration reform bill today. This bill appreciates the importance of \naddressing the problem of illegal immigration and border security while \nat the same time proposing an intelligent solution to the issue of the \nmillions of people here without documentation today.\n  First and foremost, we need to control our borders and enforce our \nlaws. This bill adds thousands of additional border patrol agents and \nauthorizes the use of the National Guard to help secure our borders. It \nwisely increases the use of technology--including unmanned aerial \nvehicles, UAVs, cameras, and motion sensors--so we can succeed in \ncontrolling our borders. It also enhances the authority of our \nimmigration enforcement officials to deport criminals and others who \nmay seek to do us harm. This will significantly enhance our ability to \ncatch people before they enter the country, and deport those who do. I \ncould not support a bill that I did not believe could secure our \nborders.\n  Border security alone is not sufficient. We must also enforce our \nlaws in our interior. This bill includes a strong employment \nverification system, so that employers can determine who in this \ncountry is eligible to work, and will be punished when they employ \nthose who are here illegally. If we do not dry up the demand for \nillegal workers among employers, it will remain difficult to control \nthe supply of illegal immigrants trying to enter our country.\n  Law enforcement alone, however, is not the entire solution. We must \nbe realistic about how to deal with the millions of undocumented \nimmigrants currently in this country. It is not realistic to deport \nthem all. For those hardworking, law-abiding people who have been here \nfor years and set down roots in our communities, it is reasonable to \nallow them to earn citizenship over a significant time period. This is \nnot amnesty, and it is not automatic legalization. Under this bill, if \nthey pay thousands of dollars in fines for violating our immigration \nlaws, work for a number of years, learn English, and pay any taxes they \nmay owe, only then do they go to the back of the citizenship line. They \nare asked to earn their legalization over the course of eleven or \ntwelve years and demonstrate that they deserve to be an American.\n  We have succeeded in creating a comprehensive bipartisan solution, \none that I believe effectively addresses each of the many complex \nissues that plague our immigration system today. There are few issues \nas important as immigration facing this country today, and I am glad \nthat we have put the time and effort into crafting a solution we can be \nproud of: one that is both tough and fair.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to comment on amendment No. \n4084, which was tabled yesterday.\n  The Chambliss amendment would modify the eligibility requirements for \nblue card and green card status under AgJOBS, as drafted in the \nComprehensive Immigration Reform Act.\n  The Chambliss amendment would make the AgJOBS earned legalization \nprogram unworkable by denying most farm workers access to it.\n  Just yesterday, my staff received an e-mail from the California \nCanning Peach Association, which produces 80 percent of the peach \nvolume in California. They said that the Chambliss amendment would \neliminate at least 90 percent of their workers from pursuing earned \nadjustment under the current AgJOBS language.\n  When I look at the Chambliss amendment, I find it to be counter to \nthe language in AgJOBS.\n  One reason I believe the Chambliss amendment is counter to providing \nAmerican farmers with a legal work force is the work day requirement he \nproposes.\n  Senator Chambliss' amendment would change the definition of \n``workday'' to 8 hours per day. This change would essentially gut the \nbill because agricultural workers simply wouldn't be able to \ndemonstrate 8-hour workdays.\n  Under his amendment, in order to get a blue card, agricultural \nworkers would have to prove that they worked at least 150 work days per \nyear during the 24-month period ending on December 31, 2005.\n  Anything short of an 8-hour day wouldn't count.\n  This is just unworkable and impractical. There are many reasons why a \nfarm worker might not be able to demonstrate 8-hour workdays, such as:\n  Weather conditions--maybe it is raining or too cold, there's hail. \nFor instance, oranges can't be picked wet nor can table grapes. So if \nit rains and workers have only worked 6 hours, they have to call it a \nday. That wouldn't count under the Chambliss amendment.\n  Transportation issues--workers may not be able to catch a ride one \nday, or their ride may leave after only 7 hours. That wouldn't count \nunder the Chambliss amendment.\n  Market demands--workers can only pick what growers ask of them, and \nif the market only demands x number of oranges in 1 day and that only \ntakes 6 hours, then that is all the work they will have in that day. \nThat wouldn't count under the Chambliss amendment.\n  Sickness--a worker may have a cold or other ailment that might keep \nthem from working for a few days. In agriculture, given the seasonal \nnature of work, a few days lost are precious to a worker.\n  Labor shortages--one condition that growers tell me about are labor \nshortages and how they impact how many hours workers put in. For \ninstance, a crew of workers might be in such demand that they only put \nin 7 hours each per day. That wouldn't count under the Chambliss \namendment.\n  All of these are reasons why workers may not put in 8-hour workdays. \nAnd if they don't, then that doesn't count toward their eligibility and \nthey remain here illegally.\n  The average number of hours that California agricultural workers log \ndaily is 5.97 hours per day. And that's for crops like citrus, \nvegetables, tree fruit.\n  Many farm workers do not work 8 hours per day even when working full-\ntime and 6 days a week.\n  Frequently, agricultural workers work 3 to 7 hours per day. This \namendment would deny workers credit for their farm work on such days, \nand deprive them of the chance to enter the program.\n  Many jobs in agriculture result in fewer than 8 hours per day, \nparticularly at times other than the peak of the harvest.\n  Luawanna Hallstrom with Harry Singh & Sons, which is the largest \nsingle vine ripe tomato grower in the\n\n[[Page S5177]]\n\ncountry, explained the following to my staff about the average hours \nworked in a season, and how they may vary in a typical year or season \nat their farm in San Diego, CA.\n  She said that work hours and days can change from one year to the \nnext because of reasons beyond their control--weather, production, \nchanges to timing of harvest, fluctuation in number of employees \navailable at any point in time, disease and more.\n  Ms. Hallstrom noted that agriculture is extremely fluid and \nvulnerable and a typical work week for them can consist of anything \nfrom 0 to 10 hours.\n  Another grower, Benny Jefferson, a large vegetable grower in \nMonterey, CA told my staff that his average worker works 6 hours per \nday and that 8-hour days would be a serious problem for him.\n  By way of example, the following job offers were posted in America's \nJob Bank of the U.S. Department of Labor:\n  Seeking farm worker for ``harvesting fruits such as blueberries, \ncherries, strawberries, grapes, oranges, and pecans'' in Georgia for \n``full time'' work of 32 hours per week.\n  Seeking Citrus Harvest Worker in Florida for a contract period from \nApril 30, 2006, to June 30, 2006, Monday through Saturday. Hours: 36 \nhours per week, 6 hours per day.\n  Florida employers seek nursery labor in West Virginia for 40 hours \nweek, 7 hours per day Monday through Friday and 5 hours on Saturdays.\n  What do these job postings show? That even ``full time'' work often \nmeans less than 8 hours per day.\n  So I believe that the Chambliss amendment, if successful, would \ndeprive most farm workers of the chance to enter the earned \nlegalization program, or if they entered, the chance to earn a green \ncard.\n  The Chambliss amendment is an effort to destroy the AgJOBS \ncompromise. It is not only unfair but counterproductive.\n  One purpose of AgJOBS is to stabilize the workforce by encouraging \nundocumented workers to come forward and work in agriculture in return \nfor the opportunity to earn a blue card and eventually, after \nadditional hard work in the fields, a green card.\n  By depriving many farm workers of this opportunity, the Chambliss \namendment would perpetuate the unstable farm labor force that contains \nso many undocumented workers.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, on May 1, I was in Chicago to witness a \nmonumental event. There were close to half a million people marching \nfor comprehensive immigration reform. They were mostly people of \nMexican origin, but among them were also Nigerians, Polish, Irish, \nCentral American immigrants, and their American-born friends, family, \nand supporters.\n  By now, most Americans are familiar with the issues surrounding \nimmigration. We have a system of legal immigration under which 1 \nmillion people apply for legal residency each year and eventually \npursue citizenship if they choose. Another 500,000 come across the \nborder illegally and evade our border patrol.\n  There are an estimated 12 million undocumented persons here working \nmostly in backbreaking jobs in agriculture, construction, packing \nplants, restaurants, and elsewhere. Some in the media have presented \nthem as an invading hoard.\n  But I spoke to the marchers who gathered 3 weeks ago, and what I saw \nwas nothing to fear. They have come here for the same reason other \nimmigrants have come for generations: to pursue the notion that they \ncan make a better life for themselves, and most importantly for their \nchildren, if they work hard and apply themselves.\n  Our country is ambivalent about this influx of undocumented \nimmigrants. Many Americans, including myself, believe that these people \nare doing what many of us would do for our own children in the same \nsituation. They take immense risks to get here and would not have come \nillegally if they could have come legally through the limited visas we \nissue each year.\n  But while Americans understand the human desire to pursue a better \nlife, they know we do not have an infinite capacity to absorb everyone \nwho would like to come here. Ours is a nation of laws. And we cannot \nperpetuate a system that continues to have people coming here outside \nthe law.\n  Economists debate the effect undocumented workers have on the economy \nand opportunities available to Americans. There are areas where \nimmigrants are doing jobs Americans would not do. But there are other \ncircumstances where employers are bringing in workers for jobs that \nAmericans would fill if employers paid fair wages. In the African-\nAmerican community, where unemployment rates often remain high, there \nis some tension about whether we should be importing large numbers of \nworkers to compete with American workers.\n  What I say to them is that immigrants in illegal status have no \nability to fight for fair pay and fair treatment. African-American \nworkers and Latinos at the bottom of the wage ladder will all be better \noff if these workers can come out hiding and defend themselves.\n  Today, under Chairman Specter, Senator Leahy, Senator McCain, and \nSenator Kennedy's leadership, we will pass a bill that provides \nstronger border security, meaningful enforcement in the workplace, and \na long, earned pathway to citizenship. The idea for the undocumented is \nthat they would jump through multiple hoops over an 11-year period to \nearn the right to stay and eventually become citizens of the United \nStates.\n  The Senate bill upholds our tradition as a nation of immigrants and \nproposes reforms in a comprehensive, commonsense manner, and it imposes \nnew, strict but sensible enforcement mechanisms.\n  The opponents of this effort have called it amnesty. They would \nprefer a punitive House bill that builds a wall across our southern \nborder, deports the 12 million people here illegally, and makes any \nundocumented worker a felon.\n  That kind of approach is not realistic. We are not going to deport 12 \nmillion people. Millions of them have American children. Many have been \nhere for many years and have deep roots. It is hard to imagine that we \nwould have police and immigration officials invading people's homes, \nseparating families, and forcibly sending people home. But Americans \nare right to demand that we end illegal immigration going forward.\n  The draconian House legislation led to the marches. But what started \nas marches of fear on the part of immigrant workers has turned into a \nmovement of hope. People are hoping they have an opportunity to \nlegalize their status in some way. Their hope and our hope is that we \ncan move forward together.\n  This was and will continue to be an emotional debate. What we saw in \nthe marches was the face of a new America. The face of our country is \nchanging, and we cannot be threatened by it. I strongly believe that we \nare going to be better off united than divided.\n  But I also believe in a common culture. I told the immigrants at the \nmarches that citizenship involves a common language, a common faith in \nthe country, a common sense of purpose, and a loyalty to a common flag. \nI believe that this is what the immigrant community wants. They want to \nfollow in the steps of the millions who came before them and helped our \ncountry meld from many peoples into one Nation. In diversity we come \ntogether as one.\n  To those who fear immigrants, I say we cannot have a country in which \nyou have a servant class picking our lettuce, mowing our lawns, and \ncaring for our children, but who never have the full rights and \nobligations of citizenship.\n  Today, the Senate will respond to the call for action from not only \nthese marchers but all Americans who want to uphold our finest \ntraditions. It has been a tough few weeks, but I am proud of this body \ntoday. We worked hard, conducted a civil debate, and have taken a big \nstep toward fixing our immigration system. My hope is the conferees \nwill put their stamp of approval on the Senate bill we are passing \ntoday.\n  Let me say that while I support this bill, it is not perfect. I have \nserious reservations about several of the provisions in the bill, most \nnotably the guest worker provision. I voted for two amendments offered \nby Senator Dorgan that would have eliminated or sunsetted the \nprovision, but these amendments failed. I am pleased, however, that the \nSenate adopted an\n\n[[Page S5178]]\n\namendment by Senator Bingaman that lowers the number of guest workers \nthat could enter the country under this bill.\n  I also am concerned about the changes we have made to the diversity \nvisa program that will end up disadvantaging potential immigrants from \nunderrepresented countries, such as African countries.\n  On balance, however, this is a very good bill. It gives us strong \nborder security, makes hiring illegal workers virtually impossible, and \nprovides all those families, children, mothers, and fathers I saw in \nthat amazing march with the opportunity to become full members of the \nAmerican community.\n  I was pleased that two amendments I offered were included in the \nbill. One amendment strengthened the prevailing wage requirements in \nthe bill for all American workers and all jobs. It also ensured that \ncommunities where the American unemployment rate is high will not \nexperience unnecessary competition from guest workers.\n  The second amendment was a collaborative effort with Senators \nGrassley, Kennedy, and Baucus to create a new employment eligibility \nverification system. We are making it simple but mandatory for \nemployers to verify that their employees are legally eligible to work \nhere. This amendment will have a far greater impact on stopping the \nflow of illegal immigrants into this country than simply building a \nfence along the border.\n  I commend my colleagues for their work on this legislation. Together, \nwith faith in the values that unite our country, we are moving forward \ntrue to our tradition as a nation of immigrants that is capable of \ncoming together to resolve difficult challenges.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am voting for the immigration reform \nbill today because it is urgent that we act to secure our borders. And \nwe must find a way to deal with the 11 or 12 million illegal immigrants \nalready living in the United States. As imperfect as this bill is, it \nis at least a beginning on strengthening our borders and dealing with \nthose who are here illegally.\n  Currently, we have 500,000 new illegal immigrants entering our \ncountry every year. That is an unacceptable security risk. If we cannot \ncontrol our border, we cannot control our future.\n  This bill dramatically strengthens border security. It provides for \ntriple-layered fencing, adds thousands of additional Border Patrol \nagents, and cracks down on employers who hire illegal aliens.\n  The bill also begins to deal with the 11 to 12 million illegal \nimmigrants who are currently in this country. The bill provides a path \nto earned legalization for those who pay a fine, pay back taxes, learn \nEnglish, and fulfill other requirements. We need some process like \nthis; the alternative of deporting 11 million people who do not want to \nleave is simply unrealistic.\n  Finally, the Congressional Budget Office has concluded that this bill \nwill have a positive effect in reducing the deficit.\n  However, there are serious flaws in this bill. I think that asking \nthe millions of illegal aliens who have been in this country fewer than \n5 years to return home before getting on a path to citizenship is \nunworkable. And, although the bill was improved by cutting in half the \nnumber of new guest workers who will be able to enter the country next \nyear, I still cannot support the guest worker provisions. Finally, \noverall, the bill will result in millions of new immigrants entering \nthe country over the next decade. In my view, we need to consider very \ncarefully the effects on our society of trying to assimilate such a \nlarge number of additional immigrants in a relatively short period of \ntime.\n  But at the end of the day, we are faced with one question: will this \nbill help secure our borders and deal with the people who are here \nillegally? I have concluded that, although deeply flawed in many \nrespects, it does make improvements over the current failed system.\n  This is not the end of the process. During the negotiations between \nthe House and the Senate, there will be opportunities to address the \nserious flaws and produce a better bill. If, at the end of the process, \nthe bill is not substantially improved, I will not be able to support \nthe final product.\n  Mr. Hatch. Mr. President, although I rise today in opposition to S. \n2611, the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006, I would like to \ntake a moment to commend its proponents.\n  The task of reforming this Nation's broken immigration system is \nHerculean. As my colleagues know all too well, the issue of immigration \nriles--justifiably so--the public like nothing else. I cannot think of \nany piece of legislation that has provoked a prolonged national debate \nsuch as this one. I cannot think of a day in recent months that I have \nnot turned on the television or picked up a newspaper and read about or \nlistened to a discussion of immigration reform.\n  This bill consisted of roughly 616 pages when we began this debate \nlast week, and I have no doubt that the legislation is now over 700 \npages. This undertaking has been truly monumental, and while I do not \nagree with the result, I must acknowledge and commend the sincerity, \nthe diligence, and the good faith of the bill's architects.\n  The majority leader, the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, should \nbe recognized for his leadership on this pivotal issue. The fact that \nSenator Frist has managed to get an immigration bill through the Senate \ndespite a splintered caucus and a hotly partisan atmosphere is a \ntribute to his abilities as a leader.\n  While I believe Senator Frist deserves a great deal of the accolades \nfor the passage of this bill today, I would be remiss if I did not \nmention Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter. The senior Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania has once again achieved the impossible. This bill, \nregardless of what one thinks of the policies it contains, is a tribute \nto his daunting work ethic, intelligence, and remarkable ability. Time \nand time again, Chairman Specter has overcome the odds both personally \nand professionally--to make sure the people's work is done, and done \nwell.\n  There are many others who deserve recognition--Senators Mel Martinez \nand Chuck Hagel were critical to this effort, and we cannot ignore the \ntireless efforts of Senators John McCain and Ted Kennedy. I must also \nthank Senators John Kyl, Jeff Sessions, and John Cornyn for their \nvigilance and conscientious objections to this legislation. Their work \nhas been invaluable and will continue to be so as we move to \nconference.\n  It is with great regret that I cannot endorse the substance of the \nbill before us despite the best efforts of many in this body. There are \nmany laudable aspects of this bill--particularly the enforcement \nprovisions--and, as many believe, the DREAM Act, upon which we worked \nso hard through the years, but at the end of the day this bill amounts \nto an amnesty that is several orders of magnitude larger than the one \nundertaken in 1986.\n  I would like to provide some perspective to this debate. In 1982, \naward-winning journalist Mr. Theodore W. White stated the following in \nhis book, America in Search of Itself: ``The United States has lost one \nof the cardinal attributes of sovereignty--it no longer controls its \nown borders. Its immigration laws are flouted by aliens and citizens \nalike, as no system of laws has been flouted since Prohibition.'' These \nwords were true nearly a quarter of century ago, and they are true \ntoday. Some may ask what Congress has done to address the issue during \nthis time well, I will tell you. In 1986, Congress passed, among other \nthings, the Immigration Reform and Control Act, or IRCA, and we passed \nstringent enforcement measures in the 1990s. I submit that neither the \nIRCA amnesty policy nor the previous enforcement measures have worked. \nMoreover, I submit that the current legislation amounts to the \ncombination of two failed policies that will yield nearly identical \nresults today and in the future.\n  We are all aware that we have lost control of our own borders. The \nPresident of the United States has made statements to that effect. \nSomething has to be done. Illegal immigration has also been tied in \nwith the enormous flow of illegal drugs into this country and to \ninternational terrorist violence being imported here from abroad. \nSomething must be done, but this bill is not the answer.\n  The idea that a legalization or amnesty can be given to potentially \nmillions of illegal immigrants, who arrived illegally in this country \nbefore\n\n[[Page S5179]]\n\nJanuary of 2004, is to undermine the very principles of legality upon \nwhich our entire immigration system is founded. In the words of my \nformer colleague, Senator Richard Schweiker, the so-called legalization \nor amnesty ``puts the Government squarely behind the lawbreaker, and in \neffect, says\n`Congratulations, you have successfully violated our laws and avoided \ndetection--here is your reward.' '' In clear language, granting amnesty \nrewards the lawbreaker, pure and simple.\n  To highlight the scope of this problem and the dangers of charting \nthe wrong course yet again, I must point out to my colleagues that a \nsignificant portion of the comments I just made are over 20 years old. \nI changed a few names and a few numbers, but the substance remains the \nsame.\n  It took the proponents of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of \n1986 3 years to put a bill together. This effort took 3 months. Despite \nthe rhetoric to the contrary, the bill before us today constitutes a \nmassive amnesty one several orders of magnitude larger than the one \nundertaken 20 years ago. I do not understand how this body has failed \nto learn from its mistakes.\n  I commend the sincerity, the diligence, and the good faith of this \nbill's proponents, but I cannot agree in its result.\n  I fail to understand how a massive guest worker program that \nconstitutes an end run around our immigration system is a good idea.\n  I fail to understand how an amnesty for millions of illegals is a \ngood idea.\n  I fail to understand how a bill that does not address the root causes \nof our immigration crises is a good idea.\n  I ask my colleagues, why does this legislation ignore the \nrecommendations of the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform--an entity \nthat spent 7 years examining the issue of immigration and making \nrecommendations for this august body? Why do we insist on pursuing \nfailed policies? We have an obligation to the American people to leave \nno stone unturned in this debate, but we have failed to live up to that \nobligation.\n  The time has come to undertake truly comprehensive reform. We must \nstart from the ground up. We must secure our borders. We must identify \nthe problems with the current immigration system with certainty. We \nmust, in turn, develop meaningful solutions. I submit that the bill \nbefore us today builds upon a faulty foundation--we may have renovated \na few rooms, we may have updated a few appliances, but it will all come \nto naught unless we fix the basic structure.\n  My colleagues know the extent of my commitment to my Hispanic \nfriends. I founded and I have chaired the U.S. Senate Republican \nConference Task Force on Hispanic Affairs for years now--I know the \nimmigration issue is not solely a Latino issue, but we all know that \nthe vast majority of the illegal aliens in this country are Hispanic. I \nsay to my friends that my opposition to this bill has nothing to do \nwith a lack of support or dedication to the Latino community but, \nrather, a fundamental and principled opposition to widespread amnesty. \nWe have been down that road, and that road led us to this moment.\n  There is no question that the millions of people who are here \nillegally broke the laws of the land and further that they should not \nbe rewarded for that conduct. We gave over three million illegals \namnesty 20 years ago. Today, we are poised to grant amnesty to three \ntimes that number. When will we learn? What will we do when we are \nfaced with this exact situation in another 20 years? Enough is enough.\n  We must take the time to craft real legislation with real solutions \nto real problems. We cannot afford another failure. Our children cannot \nafford another failure. And our Nation cannot afford another failure.\n  We must restructure our visa system. We must determine--\naffirmatively--what policies should guide admission to this country. We \nmust provide for a truly temporary guest worker program. We must create \na realistic and effective employer verification system. And we must \nfind a humanitarian, just, and equitable solution to the millions of \npeople in this country illegally.\n  This bill does nothing to address the underlying flaws in the current \nimmigration system. This bill does not fix the current visa system. \nThis bill does not create a truly workable employer verification \nsystem. This bill does not create a truly temporary guest worker \nprogram. Instead, this bill creates more visa categories. It increases \nthe numbers in existing visa categories. It creates a shell of an \nemployer verification regime. It creates a guest worker program that is \nan end run around the immigration system. And finally, it grants the \nlargest amnesty ever undertaken in any country, at any time.\n  I wish I could support this bill. I wish we had taken more time in \nCommittee, I wish we had taken more time before the Committee process, \nand I wish we crafted a comprehensive reform bill that actually lived \nup to its name.\n  I am fully aware of the hard work on both sides of these very \nimportant issues. It is important that we get this bill to conference \nwhere I hope we can correct the many deficiencies therein, and I am \naware some are voting for it with that in mind despite their severe \nreservations.\n  I believe it is absolutely critical that the Congress address the \nissue of immigration, and I look forward to working to improve this \nbill during the course of our negotiations with the House. The real \nwork lies before us, and I believe the men and women of both bodies \nhave the mettle, the tenacity, the intelligence, and the drive to do \nwhat is right for the American people.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am proud to cast my vote today in support \nof S. 2611, the immigration reform bill. This legislation has strong \nbipartisan support--something we don't see enough of these days in the \nSenate. Time and time again, amendments were offered and motions were \nmade in order to derail this bill, yet time and time again, our strong \nbipartisan coalition stuck together to fend off every single attack. As \na result, we're able to pass comprehensive immigration reform--reform \nthat has a real chance of solving the immigration crisis that we face \ntoday.\n  The bill addresses what I consider to be the four cornerstones of \nsuccessful immigration reform: (1) strengthening our Nation's borders; \n(2) providing a path to legalization for the approximately 11 million \nundocumented workers currently living and working in the United States; \n(3) addressing future flow needs by adjusting visa caps and creating an \neffective guestworker program with strong labor protections; and (4) \nimplementing a reliable employment verification program. Thus, not only \nwill this bill prevent people from illegally crossing our borders, it \nwill eliminate incentive for coming illegally in the first place.\n  I am particularly happy that the bill included an amendment I offered \nto strengthen our border security. My amendment increases the number of \nborder patrol agents by an additional 1,000 this year, bringing the \ntotal number of agents in fiscal year 2006 to 3,000. It also gives \nborder State Governors the ability to request up to 1,000 more border \npatrol agents from the Secretary of Homeland Security in times of \ninternational border emergencies. We need more agents on the border, \nand we need to make sure they have the tools to get the job done. That \nis why my amendment provides more helicopters, power boats, patrol \nvehicles, GPS devices, encrypted 2-way radios, night vision equipment, \nhigh-quality border armor; and reliable and effective weapons.\n  The bill also includes my amendment to the performing artist visa, \nwhich will ensure that international artists will have their visa \npetitions processed in a timely manner. U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services, USCIS, delays are making it increasingly \ndifficult for international artists to appear in the United States. \nCurrently nonprofit arts organizations confront uncertainty in gaining \napproval for visa petitions for foreign guest artists and inconsistent \npolicies in processing artist visa petitions which result in delays, \nexpense, and unwarranted requests for further evidence. USCIS practice \ncompounds the growing risk that foreign guest artists will be unable to \nenter the U.S. in time for their engagements, causing financial burdens \non nonprofit arts organizations, and potentially denying the American \npublic the opportunity to experience international artistry due to \ndelays and cancellations. My amendment requires the UCIS to review \nthese visa\n\n[[Page S5180]]\n\napplications in a timely fashion--and consistent with protocols that \nensure our security would never be compromised.\n  Of course, the bill contains some things that I do not agree with. \nFor example, I would prefer that the bill not include Senator Inhofe's \nEnglish language amendment not because I do not believe that English \nshould be our national language but because I think the amendment will \nhave some unintended, negative consequences. I believe everyone who \naspires to be a part of our country should learn English. I was proud \nto support Senator Salazar's amendment declaring English is our common \nlanguage. Yet I felt compelled to oppose Senator Inhofe's amendment \nbecause it would prevent critical services--including health, public \nsafety, or education services--from being provided in more than one \nlanguage. I believe that in some instances it may be important for the \ngovernment to communicate in a language other than English.\n  However, I accept these provisions as part of the compromise. Take \nthe temporary worker provisions, for example. They represent a true \ncompromise between the need to protect American workers and the need to \nmeet the future labor demands of the U.S. marketplace. Thus, the bill \nallows a certain number of temporary workers into the country every \nyear, but only after the employers seeking to hire them have made \nserious efforts to hire an American worker. The bill also includes \nsignificant labor protections to ensure that temporary workers receive \nthe same wages, benefits, and working conditions as similarly-employed \nU.S. workers. Thus, the bill does everything possible to prevent \ntemporary workers from becoming a secondary class of citizens or from \ndepressing American worker wages.\n  Passing this immigration bill is just the first step. The House \npassed a punitive, enforcement-only immigration bill that I believe \nwill exacerbate rather than ameliorate the immigration crisis. The \nHouse bill sparked protests across the country. Millions of people took \nto the streets to call for a comprehensive and humane approach to \nimmigration reform. I hope that the House has heeded their calls. I \nhope that the President can rally support for a comprehensive solution. \nAnd I sincerely hope that the conference comes back with a bill I can \nsupport.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the Senate for \naccepting my amendment to the Immigration Reform Bill which addresses \nan area that needs more attention--the northern border of the United \nStates. We have 5,526 miles of border between the United States and \nCanada. This is over double the size of our southern border. Along \nMontana's 560-mile portion of the border we have remote terrain which \nis mountainous and difficult to patrol. My amendment will help our \nBorder Patrol cover this vast area by requiring the Department of \nHomeland Security to conduct a pilot program using unmanned aerial \nvehicles along the northern border.\n  In his immigration speech last week, President Bush emphasized that \nin addition to personnel and training we must also employ the latest \ntechnologies. The Border Patrol has already conducted successful tests \nusing UAVs along the southwestern border in Arizona. This was done for \nsurveillance and detection of individuals attempting to enter the U.S. \nillegally. My amendment requires that some of the UAVs already in the \nbill be used to run a pilot program on the northern border similar to \nthe program which was conducted on the southern border.\n  We don't want to compete with our friends along the U.S. border with \nMexico, but I want to make it clear that the northern border also needs \nincreased attention. As you can imagine, as the southern border of the \nU.S. is tightened, our northern border--which used to be America's back \ndoor--is quickly becoming the front door.\n  Customs and Border Patrol reports that their number one concern on \nthe southern border is illegal immigration. What is their number one \nconcern on the northern border? Terrorism. We are all aware that some \nof the 9/11 highjackers made their way into this country through \nCanada. In 1999 the ``Millennium Bomber'', Ahmed Ressam, was \napprehended on the northern border with a trunk full of explosives. His \nplan was to blow up Los Angeles International Airport. Now border gangs \nare going international and admitting having ties to Al-Qaeda and \nsmuggling Al-Qaeda members into the United States. In Montana markings \nfrom these gangs have been found in the corrections system--within the \nwalls of our jails and detention facilities.\n  Surveillance of our ports is being conducted from the Canadian side \nof the border. It appears that our procedures for checking out vehicles \nboth leaving and entering the United States are being looked at by \ncriminals and it has been reported that these ``dry runs'' are being \nconducted near Glacier National Park.\n  All of these activities are made easy due to the wide open space and \ninsufficient numbers of law enforcement along the border. Yet the bill \nthat has been before us has many provisions which are stacked against \nthe security of the northern border. For example, one provision in this \nbill provides border States with additional Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement field agents to help with necessary background checks. \nHowever, it stipulates that these allocations are not available to \nStates with populations under two million. This makes northern border \nStates Montana, North Dakota, Idaho, Alaska, Vermont, New Hampshire, \nand Maine ineligible for assistance.\n  Now the President has proposed sending our National Guard troops to \nthe southern border. We rely greatly on our National Guard and at a \ntime they are already stretched too thin, it is dangerous for us to \nlose that resource from our States. More importantly, this is being \ndone at a time when we currently have border patrol agents being \ndetailed from the northern border to the southern border.\n  The ability of our Border Patrol to successfully carry out their \ndaily duties is of critical importance to the safety of all Americans. \nThis amendment will give us the tools we need to protect our borders. \nUAVs are a safe alternative to placing civilians in harm's way and by \nintroducing a pilot program that helps us patrol our northern border, \nwe are getting on the right track to fighting the war on terrorism and \nkeeping the home front safe.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wish to speak to the very important \nissue of interior worksite enforcement in the context of the debate \nover comprehensive immigration reform legislation.\n  One of the most important elements of this bill, that is crucial to \nthe successful implementation of the guest worker and earned \nlegalization programs, is interior worksite enforcement. Only a serious \ncommitment to enforcing our immigration laws against employers who \nknowingly hire illegal immigrants will actually deter illegal \nimmigration because the number one reason people enter the United \nStates illegally is to find a job.\n  Looking back on the history of immigration reform, one of the key \nelements that has been missing, and is still missing, is successful \ninterior enforcement. However, thanks to hard work of Senators \nGrassley, Obama, Kennedy, and Baucus, this bill contains worksite \nenforcement that can work.\n  The original language in the underlying bill, S. 2611, concerned me \nin several ways, particularly with respect to certain contractor \nliability provisions that would have created a de facto ``rebuttable \npresumption'' for contractors whose subcontractors hired undocumented \nimmigrants, even if the principal contractor had no knowledge of such \nhiring. In essence, the contractors would be guilty until proven \ninnocent, even if the offense of hiring unauthorized workers was \ncommitted without their direct knowledge.\n  Before I continue, let me be clear--I am in full support of cracking \ndown on employers who knowingly hire unauthorized workers because doing \nso is the key to having a lawful and successful immigration system. \nHowever, we should not cast the net so broadly that innocent \ncontractors are punished for the independent actions of a \nsubcontractor.\n  It is somewhat clear that the contractor liability provisions in the \nunderlying bill were targeted at ``bad actor'' construction \ncontractors, but I interpret the legislation to impact all employers, \nnot just those in construction. In fact, any employer using suppliers \nor contractors involving labor in\n\n[[Page S5181]]\n\nthe normal course of their operations are impacted. A broad \ninterpretation of the language covers companies that contract with, for \nexample, suppliers of refreshments, including beverage companies that \nsupply coffee, sodas and bottled water. What about the suppliers of \ncopier services that come to fix the copy machine? Certainly they are \nsuppliers of contracts involving labor. Can all companies contracting \nfor such labor be responsible for ensuring that all of its suppliers \nemploy persons of legal status? Such a requirement is unrealistic and \nunfairly penalizes employers.\n  There exists somewhat of a defense for these companies, a ``knowing'' \nstandard, but what concerned me most was how a company could defend \nitself against accusations that it knew that its supplier employed \nillegal immigrants.\n  With the understanding that the original language applied to all \nemployers, the construction industry nevertheless represents a good \nexample of how unworkable these provisions are. The construction \nindustry is a system which includes general or prime contractors with \nsubcontractors ranging from plumbing to roofing to electrical specialty \ncontractors. On any given project, a general contractor may have \ncontractual relationships with as many as 50 different subcontractors. \nEnsuring that these prime contractors are not liable for the \nindependent, illicit behavior of one or more of the subcontractors was \nthe focus of my amendment.\n  I was also troubled by the original language, which involved a \npresumption of guilt before the company was able to prove its \ninnocence.\n  Therefore, in effort to correct these dangerous provisions, I offered \namendment number 4096 which would protect employers from being liable \nfor the illegal behavior of their suppliers and subcontractors. This \namendment resembled one that was offered during the consideration of \nH.R. 4437, the Border Protection, Antiterrorism, and Illegal \nImmigration Control Act, legislation that focused on securing the \nborder and increased internal enforcement. Offering this amendment was \nfreshman congressman, Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia's 8th district. I \nshould point out that when the House debated immigration legislation in \nDecember 2005, Westmoreland's amendment was so popular that it received \nmore votes of support than that on final passage of the legislation.\n  Though the language in the Grassley title III amendment does not \ninclude the language in my amendment, Senator Grassley's amendment is \nmuch more reasonable than the provisions in the underlying bill. \nSenator Grassley's amendment replaces the ``guilty until proven \ninnocent'' rebuttable presumption with a standard of ``knowing or with \nreckless disregard,'' which goes a long way to protect innocent \ncontractors from being held liable for actions of a subcontractor that \nare out of their control.\n  In closing, I respectfully request that the House-Senate conferees \npay careful attention to the provisions in both the House and Senate \nregarding unlawful employment of aliens. I hope the conferees will \nengage in a discussion regarding the differences between the various \nstandards for holding contractors liable for the actions of their \nsubcontractors. I understand that there exists ample case law regarding \nthe definitions of these terms, yet I ask that the conferees further \ndefine these terms for the sake of employers who will quickly be \nrequired to abide by the new provisions under this bill.\n  In addition, it is important for the conferees to clarify how the \nElectronic Employment Verification System will communicate with \ncontractors regarding the hiring practices of their subcontractors. \nThis relationship is yet unclear as the bill is currently written and \nshould be clarified before the bill becomes law.\n  I reiterate my wholehearted support for a strict worksite enforcement \nsystem that cracks down on ``bad actor'' employers who thumb their nose \nat the law by knowingly hiring unauthorized workers. These employers \nshould be punished for their actions; however, they should not be \npunished for actions taken by their subcontractors without their direct \nknowledge.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will use leader time so as not to \ninterfere with the schedule on the floor.\n  I said at the beginning of this debate 2 weeks ago that this was a \nblockbuster. I said that this is the summer season for movies and this \nis the time for blockbuster movies. ``The DaVinci Code'' and ``Mission \nImpossible III'' came out, but I said we had our own blockbuster here \nin the Senate: part 2 of immigration. Prior to the Easter recess we \nknow how immigration fared. It didn't. It stopped for a lot of \ndifferent reasons. But now we start part 2. I said that 2 weeks ago, \nand now for me, this has been such a reminder of how the Senate used to \nbe. We held a number of votes. I was on the prevailing side of some and \nI was not on the prevailing side of others. Coalitions were built here \nin the Senate, Democrats with Republicans and vice versa. That is the \nway we used to legislate.\n  In this most important bill, no one got everything they wanted. There \nwere compromises made in the committee and certainly compromises made \nhere on the Senate floor. But we have had bipartisan cooperation. This \nis comprehensive immigration reform, focusing first on border security.\n  This legislation will do so much to make our borders more secure. We \nhave done a lot of things that have never been tried before to improve \nthe security of our Nation by doing something about our borders. I have \ngone to the borders and I have seen the hard-working Border Patrolmen. \nThey work so hard with so little attention. And this legislation is the \nopportunity for them to do their jobs better, because we are going to \ngive them more resources. I would hope that we will do that. We \ncertainly need to.\n  Before we finish, I would caution everyone from confusing what we are \ndoing here today--we are going to complete passage of this bill \nshortly--with ultimate victory. This is not the final scene of this \nblockbuster that we have on the Senate floor. There is another act to \ngo. But I want to express my appreciation to the two managers, Senator \nSpecter and Senator Kennedy. They have done yeomen's work to sort \nthrough all of the hurt feelings that people have in offering these \namendments and not getting the votes they wanted when they wanted them. \nThis is a big bill to manage, and I think these two very senior Members \nof the Senate have done a tremendous job. I also want to express my \nappreciation to Senator McCain.\n  I also want to focus attention on someone who I think has done a \ngreat job on this bill, who is behind the scenes always trying to grow \nthe compromises that the managers and Senator McCain haven't been able \nto work out, and that is the senior Senator from South Carolina, \nLindsey Graham. I really have appreciated the work he has done on this \nbill. He has been a tremendous asset to Senator Kennedy, Senator \nSpecter, and Senator McCain.\n  I want to also say that my assistant whip of the Senate has done a \ngreat job. We all know that Senator Durbin legislates so much with his \nheart. He is a good person and has a good sense of what is right and \nwhat is wrong. He was heavily involved in this legislation, being a \nmember of the Judiciary Committee, and I want the Record spread with my \nappreciation for the work that he has done, being our counterpart to \nLindsey Graham, working through different issues that we have had.\n  For all of the good that we are going to be able to accomplish by \npassing this bill, there is a lot more work to do.\n  I want to say something about someone who opposes this legislation. \nNo one has been a bigger opponent of this legislation than Jeff \nSessions of Alabama. If there has been a bigger opponent, I haven't \nseen him. I have told him this personally and I will say it publicly. \nJeff Sessions and I don't agree on too much politically, in the \npolitical spectrum, but I admire how he approaches issues, because \nevery time he came to the floor to talk about an issue, he believed \nsincerely what he was doing was right, and I admire that and appreciate \nit. Now, the fact that I disagreed with him doesn't make me any more \nright than he is. That is the purpose of legislation. We present our \ncases to this body and the body decides. But I want the Senator from \nAlabama to know that I appreciate his adversarial efforts.\n\n[[Page S5182]]\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, for all the good work that we have done here \nover the past 2 weeks, it can be eliminated in a heartbeat when we go \nto conference with the House. We have seen it happen so much these last \nfew years where the minority is eliminated from decisions made, public \nconferences are not held, items that the Senate supports are stripped, \nand there is nothing to prevent the same thing from happening on this \nbill but for the good faith we have in moving forward.\n  We should know the dark clouds are forming on the horizon. \nInfluential Members of the House of Representatives in the Republican \nleadership are still pushing for the bill they passed, a bill that \nmakes felons out of millions of immigrants and those who assist them, \nsuch as a member of the clergy, a health care worker, a social worker. \nIn fact, the House Majority Leader, my friend, John Boehner, yesterday, \nwas quoted as saying:\n\n       Trying to find a pathway that is acceptable to the House \n     and Senate is going to be very difficult.\n\n  I acknowledge and say that is true. But the words we have heard from \nthe House leadership are not encouraging.\n  The one thing we fought for was to have a fair balance on the \nconference committee, and we have gotten that. I express my \nappreciation to the majority leader. We have the ability to name \nconferees on our side who I think are going to be just fine. Knowing \nthe Republicans who are going to be part of this conference committee, \nit is going to work out well. We have people who are going to work hard \nto uphold the position of the Senate.\n  But we also need the active involvement of the President. I \nappreciate what he has done to this point. I said that on a number of \noccasions before. But his biggest work is ahead of him if he wants \ncomprehensive immigration reform.\n  Yes, this bill includes border security. It includes help for guest \nworkers. Mr. President, 45,000 to 50,000 hotel rooms are going to be \nbuilt in Las Vegas in the next 4 to 5 years. I just had a meeting in my \noffice with the head of the MGM Hotel, a man who has 80,000, 90,000 \nemployees and was part of the group who got me interested in this \nlegislation. The hotel owners, the Chamber of Commerce in Las Vegas, \nand the unions have said unless we get some help on guest worker \nprograms, we can't find people to work in those 45,000 to 50,000 hotel \nrooms. That is in this bill.\n  Another thing that is in it I am proud of, and we should be proud of, \nis a pathway to legalization for people who are in America and are \nundocumented: Pay your taxes, have a job, learn English, stay out of \ntrouble, pay your penalties and fines, go to the back of the line--but \nyou can come out of the shadows.\n  Then, finally, what we have in this legislation is better--better \nemployer sanction enforcement, and we need that.\n  We are authorizing things, but they are not worth anything unless we \nappropriate the money to do them. All the measures we have relating to \nsecurity, they must be favored with appropriations bills, as with \neverything else in this bill. I hope we will have the carry-through to \ndo that. This is a two-step process from this point forward. We have to \nhave a conference and then we have to have appropriators who will do \nthe right thing.\n  Again, I feel so good today. This is what the Senate is all about. I \nspent 24 years of my life in the Congress of the United States, 20 of \nthem here in the Senate. This is the way it used to be. This is the way \nit should be in the future. I have every hope and belief that we can \nmake it that way.\n  I appreciate the courtesy of all my colleagues here allowing me to \nhave this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). Two minutes remain in opposition \nto the Ensign amendment. Who yields time? The Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the votes \noccur in the order in which the amendments were offered, provided \nfurther that following the disposition of amendments, the Senate \nproceed to an immediate vote on the managers' amendment. I also ask \nthat there be 2 minutes equally divided between the votes and that all \nvotes after the first be limited to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENZI. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, from what I \nunderstand we just got the managers' amendment. It is 115 pages. I \nthink the Senator from Arizona is one of the first ones to acknowledge \ngetting a managers' amendment with 115 pages, and then agreeing to a \ntime agreement would be a little unreasonable. So if you would take out \nthe agreement to have a vote directly on the managers' amendment until \nwe have a little bit of time to go through it, I think the unanimous \nconsent would be agreeable.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I modify the unanimous consent request to that effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modified request? \nWithout objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent Senator \nMcCain be recognized for 7 minutes, the managers be recognized for 7 \nminutes, and the leader will speak at the conclusion on leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, after several weeks of extensive debate \nand consideration of numerous and complicated amendments, the Senate is \nabout to move to final passage of S. 2611, the Comprehensive \nImmigration Reform Act. This legislation addresses comprehensively one \nof the most important and complex issues facing our country. Our \nNation's immigration system is broken. I don't think there was one \nMember of the Senate to argue that fact. Without enactment of \ncomprehensive immigration reform as provided for under this bill, our \nNation's security will remain vulnerable.\n  That is why we must pass this bill and reach a meaningful final \nproduct through conference deliberations. Our failure to produce a \nfinal comprehensive measure is an unacceptable proposition.\n  I want to first thank the President for his leadership on this issue. \nThe President's speech to the Nation last week, which I thought was \ninspired, was greeted by 74 percent of the American people overnight \nfavorably, including his absolute determination to see the Congress \nsend him a bill which has a comprehensive approach to the issue which \nwe as a Congress and a Federal Government have ignored for too long.\n  I also commend the Senate leadership on both sides of the aisle for \ntheir efforts to ensure that the Senate address this important issue \nand give us more than adequate time for a thorough debate.\n  I think this is a proud moment for the Senate, as we have conducted \ngood work and returned to orderly traditions of the legislative process \nas envisioned by our Founding Fathers.\n\n  I also again recognize Chairman Specter for his work in leading us to \nthis point in the legislative process. He and all the members of the \nJudiciary Committee deserve our appreciation for the considerable \neffort they have taken on this issue during this Congress.\n  Of course, I commend Senator Kennedy, who is perhaps the leading \nexpert on this difficult issue. He and I spent many months working to \ndevelop a comprehensive, reasonable, workable legislative proposal, \nmuch of which is contained in the bill before us.\n  I also thank Senators Brownback and Lieberman and Graham and Salazar, \nMartinez, Obama and DeWine for their shared commitment to this issue, \nin working to ensure this bill moves successfully intact through the \nlegislative process.\n  Throughout this debate we were reminded that immigration is a \nnational security issue, and it is. It is also a matter of life and \ndeath for many living along the border. We have hundreds of people \nflowing across our borders every day, coming here only in search of \nbetter lives for themselves and their families. They come to fill the \nvacant jobs at businesses and farms that struggle with real labor \nshortages that impact our economy negatively.\n  This Nation is calling for our borders to be secure, for an overhaul \nof our immigration system, and that it be done in a humane and \ncomprehensive fashion. Vote after vote after vote taken in this body \nreaffirms that fact.\n\n[[Page S5183]]\n\n  The new policies as provided for in this legislation will increase \nborder security and provide for a new temporary worker program to \nenable foreign workers to work legally in this country when there are \njobs that Americans will not fill, and will acknowledge and address in \na humanitarian and compassionate way the current undocumented \npopulation.\n  As many have noted, there are over 11 million people in America today \nwho came here illegally. They live in our cities and towns and rural \ncommunities. They harvest our crops, tend our gardens, work in our \nrestaurants, and clean our houses. They came as others before them \ncame, to grasp the lowest rung of the American ladder of opportunity, \nto work the jobs others won't, and by virtue of their own industry and \ndreams to rise and build better lives for their families and a better \nAmerica.\n  Some Americans believe we must find all these millions, round them \nup, and send them back to the country they came from. I don't know how \nyou do that, and I don't know why you would want to. Yes, in this post-\n9/11 era America must enforce its borders. There are people who wish to \ncome here to do us harm, and we must vigilantly guard against them, \nspend whatever it takes, devote as much manpower to the task as \nnecessary. But we must also find some way to separate those who have \ncome here for the same reasons every immigrant has come here from those \nwho are driven here by their hate for us and our ideals.\n  We must concentrate our resources on the latter and persuade the \nformer to come out from the shadows. We won't be able to persuade them \nif all we offer is a guarded escort back to the place of hopelessness \nand injustice that they have fled.\n  Why not say to those undocumented workers who are working the jobs \nthe rest of us refuse: Come out from the shadows, earn your citizenship \nin this country. You broke the law to come here, so you must go to the \nback of the line, pay a fine, stay employed, learn our language, pay \nyour taxes, obey our laws, and earn the right to be an American.\n  SSgt Riayen Tejada immigrated to New York from the Dominican \nRepublic. He came with two dreams, he said, to become an American \ncitizen and to serve in the U.S. Marine Corps. He willingly accepted \nthe obligations of American citizenship before he possessed all the \nrights of an American. Staff Sergeant Tejada, from Washington Heights \nby way of the Dominican Republic, father of two young daughters, died \nin an ambush on May 14, 2004. He had never fulfilled his first dream, \nto become a naturalized American citizen. But he loved this country so \nmuch that he gave his life to defend her.\n  Right now, at this very moment, there are fighting for us in Iraq and \nAfghanistan soldiers whose parents are not yet American citizens but \nwho have dreamed the dream that their sons and daughters risked their \nlives to defend. They should make us proud to be Americans. These \npeople have come for the very same reason immigrants have always come \nto America. They came to grasp the lowest rung of the ladder, and they \nintend to rise. Let them rise. Let them rise. We will be better for it.\n  For America--blessed, bountiful, beautiful America--is still the land \nof hope and opportunity, the land of the immigrant's dreams. Long may \nshe remain so.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, when Oscar Handlin, the eminent historian \nat Harvard, won the Pulitzer Prize in 1952 for his history of \nimmigration ``The Uprooted,'' he said he had set out to write a history \nof immigrants in America, but ``discovered that the immigrants were \nAmerica.''\n  With passage of this legislation, we reclaim that America. We lift \nonce again the lamp beside the golden door.\n  This is the most far-reaching immigration reform in our history. It \nis a comprehensive and realistic attempt to solve the real-world \nproblems that have festered for too long in our broken immigration \nsystem.\n  It strengthens our security and reflects our humanity. It is intended \nto keep out those who would harm us and welcome those who contribute to \nour country. It has the potential to build a stronger, better, fairer \nAmerica for the 21st century.\n  It protects our security through stricter enforcement, tamper-proof \nimmigration cards, and high-tech border controls.\n  It protects American jobs and wages by bringing immigrants out of the \nshadows and requiring employers to pay fair American wages.\n  And it enables decent men and women who work hard and play by the \nrules to earn the privilege of American citizenship.\n  That has been America's story. And it's a story we must live anew \nwith each new generation if we hope to continue as a vibrant land of \nliberty, progress and opportunity--a land of people who want to do \nbetter, who love their families, embrace our Nation, and are proud to \nbe American citizens.\n  Wisdom in immigration policy doesn't just happen. It is a choice \nbetween a future of progress as a nation of immigrants or a future \ndefined by high walls and long fences.\n  Clearly, we still have much to do before this legislation becomes the \nnew law of the land. Some believe that enforcement is the only path to \ntake.\n  I would urge them to remember that from the beginning to the present \nday, immigrants helped build our country, and made us strong.\n  They worked in our factories and toiled in our fields, and we are \nstronger for it.\n  They built the railroads that took America to the West. Even today, \nit is said that under every railroad tie, an Irishman is buried.\n  Immigrants have loved America and fought under our flag, and we are \nstronger for it.\n  And if we enact this bipartisan comprehensive reform, we will be \nstronger for it too.\n  As we close this debate, I commend our two leaders, Senator Frist and \nSenator Reid, for their skill in enabling this debate to take place. At \na time of heated political division in Congress, the debate we have \nseen these past 2 weeks is unique in recent times. Senators of both \nparties have come together for the common good. This opportunity would \nnot have been possible without our leaders, and I hope it is a \nprecedent for other major issues in the weeks ahead.\n  I commend President Bush for putting this issue before the country \nand for helping Americans understand the need for comprehensive reform.\n  I commend the chairman and ranking member of our Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Specter and Senator Leahy, for their strong support throughout \nthis process.\n  I thank those of our bipartisan group who stood together to make this \nlegislation possible--Senator Graham, Senator Salazar, Senator \nMartinez, Senator Hagel, Senator Durbin, Senator Lieberman, Senator \nBrownback, Senator Obama, and Senator DeWine.\n  And most of all, I express my appreciation to my colleague, Senator \nMcCain, who made all this possible from the start. He'd probably prefer \nI didn't say this, but he's been a profile in courage once again, and I \ncommend him for his leadership.\n  I'm also grateful to the many staff members who helped to get us to \nthis point. I'm grateful to Ron Weich and Serena Hoy of Senator Reid's \nstaff; to Bruce Cohen, Tara Magner and Matt Virkstis of Senator Leahy's \nstaff; to Joe Zogby of Senator Durbin's staff; to Jennifer Duck and \nMontserrat Miller of Senator Feinstein's staff; to Felicia Escobar of \nSenator Salazar's staff; to Tom Klouda and Alan Cohen of Senator \nBaucus' staff; to Kevin Landy of Senator Lieberman's staff; to Danny \nSepulveda of Senator Obama's staff; and to Chris Schloesser of Senator \nMenendez' staff.\n  This was a truly bipartisan effort, and I'm grateful to staff from \nthe other side of the aisle as well: Juria Jones, Joe Jacqot, and \nMichael O'Neill of Senator Specter's staff; to Clay Deatherage, Brian \nWalsh, and Nilda Pedrosa of Senator Martinez' staff; to Jill Konz and \nSteve Taylor of Senator Hagel's staff; to Matt Rimkunas of Senator \nGraham's staff; to Steve Robinson of Senator Grassley's staff; to Ajit \nPai and Bryan Clark of Senator Brownback's staff; and to Brook Roberts \nof Senator Craig's staff.\n  And special thanks, of course, to Senator McCain's staff, with whom \nwe've\n\n[[Page S5184]]\n\nworked so closely over the past year--Ann Begeman and Brook Sikora. And \nI'd like to express my deep appreciation for Becky Jensen. Without her \nvision and determination, this bill would never have happened.\n  On my own staff, I'm very very grateful to the many who worked so \nlong and hard as well to make this day possible--Jeffrey Teitz, James \nFlug, James Walsh, Laura Capps, Missy Rohrbach, Lauren McGarity, Guarav \nLaroia, Charlotte Burrows, Christine Leonard, and Michael Myers.\n  My special thanks go to two on my staff who worked so hard over so \nmany months on this bill, Janice Kaguyutan and Marc Rosenblum.\n  Finally, and certainly not least, there's our hero of the hour--a \nremarkable person with extraordinary talent, skill and compassion. \nWe've all come to rely on her knowledge and judgment in moving this \nbill forward--Esther Olavarria.\n  Some say the easy part of this debate is over, and now we face the \nhard part reconciling the Senate bill with the House bill. We'll do our \nbest, and I'm optimistic we can resolve our differences again.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the U.S. Senate is on the verge of \npassing landmark legislation. It has had a long, tortuous path. The \nMcCain-Kennedy bill was the core proposition and went through very \nsubstantial hearings in the Judiciary Committee and a complex markup. \nIt came to the floor at a moment when it was foundering, and we added \nto it Hagel-Martinez and their ideas to break a very complex logjam at \nthat time.\n  We have labored under the competing principles of rule of law and \nconcern for immigrants who have come to the United States without \ncomplying with the law.\n  On the other side, the rich tradition of the formation and \ndevelopment of the greatest country in the history of the world, the \nUnited States of America, made up of immigrants. Some came here \nillegally and some did not. But we are the melting pot, and the \nimmigrants have contributed enormously and have made this the great \ncountry which it is today.\n  As we approach the final moments of action in the Senate, we are \naware that there are still very strident competing concerns, strident \ncompeting interests of those who continue to insist that our \nlegislation is amnesty, contrasted with those of us who point to the \nfacts. The definition of amnesty is forgiveness of some wrongdoing, \nwhich is not the case.\n  There is a rigorous ladder which these undocumented immigrants have \nto pass through. They have to pay a fine, and that $2,000 fine in the \nunderlying bill has now been increased to $3,250. They have to undergo \na criminal background check, they have to pay back taxes, they have to \nlearn English, they have to work for 6 years, and they go to the back \nof the line. It is genuinely earned citizenship by any measure.\n  We have had a very constructive debate here. We have improved the \nbill. The bill has been improved not only by the bipartisan coalition \nin favor of it, but it has been improved by the critics.\n  In committee we had a very rigorous debate. Objections were raised by \nSenator Kyl, by Senator Coburn, and by Senator Sessions. Their concerns \nhave been taken into account in structuring the final product which we \nhave.\n  There has been a real balance for those who say that there ought to \nbe border security before we consider a guest worker program or before \nwe consider placing undocumented immigrants on the path to citizenship. \nWe have provided very rigorous border safeguards.\n  We have provided for enforceable employer sanctions to see to it that \nimmigrants who do not qualify do not get jobs. There has been a \nreduction in the number of green cards, 325,000 to 200,000. We have \nmade major concessions to those who have been looking for enforcement \nby itself.\n  At the same time, we have structured a complex arrangement giving \nthose here 5 years or more of the path to citizenship. We made a \ndistinction based upon how deep their roots were here. Those who were \nhere 5 years or more have an easier path, although they go to the back \nof the line. Those here 2 to 5 years have to touch back before coming \nback to a guest worker program and then on the path to citizenship. \nThose here for less than 2 years have to return to their native country \nand get in line if they want to come back to the United States.\n  That cutoff was made on January 7, 2004, the date the President made \na speech outlining immigration reform. So they were on notice that they \nwould be in a different category.\n  This is a practical approach. When we have 11 million people who are \nundocumented immigrants, we obviously do not want to create a fugitive \nclass in America--an underclass.\n  If anybody has a better idea, we have been open to it, and we are \nstill open to it as this bill will go to conference.\n  I am not pessimistic about the prospects of the conference. We have a \nbicameral legislature. We have to have agreement between both the House \nand the Senate. There is a genius in the American constitutional form \nof government in the separation of powers. No one has too much power.\n  We have worked out differences in the past, complicated problems on \nthe PATRIOT Act, complicated problems on other legislation where we \nhave gone to conference with the House Judiciary Committee under the \nable leadership of Chairman Sensenbrenner.\n  We have had the leadership of the President on his nationwide speech \nat a critical moment in the progress of their bill. The President has \nbeen commended by all of those who have been in the leadership role on \nthis bill.\n  We look forward to the President's more intense participation. He is \nthe leader.\n  We have the House and Senate controlled by the Republican Party. \nThere is an important political issue about the ability of Republicans \nto govern and whether we can do that. There is an election in November. \nOur leadership position as Republicans is on the line. I think that \nwill weigh heavily in the conference.\n  But most of all, I credit the bipartisan nature of what has been \ndone.\n  Every morning during the course of the 2 weeks of debate a group of \nSenators met, Democrats and Republicans, to work through the issues and \nto be prepared for the debate of the day. I am pleased to see the \ncomplex issues debated in the best traditions of the Senate.\n  I look forward to a productive, constructive and successful \nconference with the House of Representatives, and ultimately a day when \nthere will be a signing by the President of the United States of this \nimportant landmark legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  We are awaiting the arrival of the majority leader who should be here \nmomentarily.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, will the manager withhold?\n  Mr. President, I rise today to share my views on the work that the \nSenate has undertaken over the last several weeks on a very difficult \nand complex issue--comprehensive immigration reform. Before I start, I \nwould like to acknowledge the work of many of my colleagues, who have \nspent years attempting to address various aspects of this issue and who \nhave worked in good faith to get us to the place we find ourselves as \nwe conclude debate on the legislation before us.\n  Last month when the Senate first began consideration of this matter, \nthe process fell apart rather suddenly because of procedural issues \nregarding which and how many amendments would be offered. These were \nlegitimate concerns, since nearly 400 amendments were introduced, and \nsince many of those amendments were intended to gut that measure.\n  In order to get this reform right, we need to address all three \ncomponents of immigration--border security and enforcement, guest \nworker programs and, for undocumented workers who are currently in the \nU.S., a path to ``earned'' citizenship. We need to also reconcile the \nfact that we are nation of immigrants with ongoing legitimate economic, \nsocial and national security concerns related to the undocumented \nindividuals currently within our borders and the impact of continuing \nto welcome newcomers to our Nation has on those concerns.\n  But let me be clear from the outset. Immigration reform must first \nand foremost be about protecting America's national security, economy, \nand citizens from the myriad challenges we face in the 21st century. We \nmust have\n\n[[Page S5185]]\n\nno higher priorities than these. Fundamentally protecting our national \nsecurity means securing our borders.\n  I believe that the bill before us, with all the additions we have \nmade as the Senate has worked its will on this measure, is an imperfect \ndocument, but probably the best we are going to achieve given the \npolarizing nature of many of the issues that have been debated, adopted \nand rejected.\n  On a positive note, the bill does set the stage for the United States \nto greatly increase control over our borders and help prevent \nindividuals from illegally entering our country. Among other things, it \nwould provide advanced border security technologies to assist those \ntasked with protecting our borders. And it would improve our ability to \nenforce our immigration laws by making structural reforms and \nincreasing personnel and funding levels where they are needed most. It \nwould also double the size of the border patrol over 5 years, adding \n12,000 new agents to patrol our borders. It would expand the number of \ninterior enforcement officers by 1,000 per year over each of the next 5 \nyears. It would utilize advanced technologies to improve surveillance \nalong the border, creating a ``virtual fence'' to detect and apprehend \npeople who are illegally attempting to enter this country. And it would \ncreate new and increased penalties for individuals trying to subvert \nour borders with tunnels, or who attempt to smuggle people into the \nU.S.\n  These are all critical measures. I support them. Other measures \nadopted in the name of better controlling our borders, will in my view \nhave less than optimum results. I am thinking of the vote that occurred \nlast week to unilaterally construct a 370-mile fence in border areas in \nCalifornia and Arizona. I believe that no fence or wall or other \nbarrier is going to stop desperate people from entering our country \nunless we do something about the conditions on the other side of the \nborder and the historic unwillingness of Mexican authorities to take \nsteps to dissuade its citizens from illegally crossing the border. That \nis why I opposed this initiative and have sought to strengthen the \nlikelihood that we will get more rather than less cooperation from \nMexican authorities by proposing an amendment to require advance \nconsultations at the federal, state and local levels of government on \nboth sides of the border before fence construction moves forward. I am \ngrateful to the managers for their willingness to accept this \namendment.\n\n  Securing our borders, while necessary is only one part of the bigger \nimmigration equation. Were we to deal with that issue, while ignoring \ntwo other goals--bringing 11 to 12 million undocumented workers out of \nthe shadows, and putting in place limited and carefully regulated guest \nworker programs to fill jobs when no Americans are available or willing \nto take them, we would not have fundamentally confronted the national \nsecurity implications of immigration. In my view, turning our backs on \nthis reality is the same as turning our backs on real and lasting \nimmigration reform.\n  I would say the following with respect to the 11 to 12 million \nundocumented individuals living within our borders.\n  These are predominantly hardworking individuals, who are not here to \nflood the welfare rolls or collect our charity. They are here to work \nand to contribute. They want what all of our families wanted when they \ncame to the U.S.--a piece of the American dream.\n  However, I understand the concerns of those who rightly state that \nthese undocumented workers came here illegally. The pending bill \nrecognizes that fact. And so it wouldn't give them a free ride. \nInstead, it would penalize illegal immigrants by requiring undocumented \nworkers to pay fines. It would require them to pay all back taxes, \nsubmit themselves to background checks, and learn English. And for \nthose who are eligible, this process would take an average of 11 years.\n  Yet even with these tough measures, it provides an incentive for \nundocumented workers to come out into the open. Frankly, we need to be \nhonest with ourselves that they're not going to come out of the \nwoodwork if they face deportation. No rational person would do that.\n  Why is getting them to come out into the open so important?\n  Because the presence of so many individuals without documentation in \nour country creates enormous challenges for law enforcement and \nundermines worker protections. It is bad for our security, bad for the \nAmerican worker, and bad for undocumented immigrants themselves.\n  But not all people seek to come permanently to the U.S. Many seek \ntemporary work here and desire to return home when that work is \ncomplete. The pending proposal contains extensive provisions related to \nguest workers.\n  There are legitimate concerns that temporary workers might displace \nAmerican workers who are available and willing to take a job. That \nshould never be the case. American jobs should always be filled first \nand foremost with American workers. Only after serious efforts to find \nAmerican applicants to fill vacancies have been exhausted are guest \nworker programs justifiable. Much has been done in the course of \nconsideration of this legislation to ensure more due diligence on the \npart of employers to look first to Americans to fill jobs.\n  Moreover, we need to be judicious when it comes to determining the \nnumber of guest worker visas that are needed. This shouldn't be \nan excessively high number that increases automatically every year. \nInstead, it should match actual needs. That's why I supported a number \nof amendments by my colleagues to place certain caps on the number of \nguest worker visas that are granted. As I've already said, the numbers \nof visas should match needs. If at any point in the future the U.S. \ngovernment determines that needs aren't being met, then we can always \nchange the numbers to reflect the facts on the ground. But we need to \nturn to American workers first, not foreign workers.\n\n  Some of my other concerns with the outlines of the guest worker \nprograms have been addressed in the course of our consideration of the \nbill. Worker portability and the right to unionize were key \ndeficiencies that have been remedied during the amendment process. \nThese fixes were important, because if done incorrectly, guest worker \nprovisions could produce a permanent underclass and downward pressure \non wages for American workers.\n  I remain concerned about a number of the provisions that have been \nadopted in the course of consideration of this legislation--some by \nvery close votes. Among these are conflicting provisions on the nature \nand role of the English language, one of which could result in some of \nour own citizens being denied full participation in our society and \nopportunities to improve English proficiency. The other amendment \nrecognizes the importance of the English language as a unifying force \nin our society without eliminating the many safeguards in law to ensure \nthat those Americans with imperfect language skills can still \nparticipate in society.\n  Before concluding, I would like to speak briefly of two provisions in \nthe bill which have gotten very little attention but which are very \nimportant and constructive additions to the overall package.\n  First, I am pleased that it includes provisions of the DREAM Act. \nI've long supported the DREAM Act, which in my view is a common sense \nmeasure, allowing undocumented students under the age of 16--who were \nbrought into this country illegally through no fault of their own--a \nchance to complete higher education.\n  Qualifying students, however, will have had to live in the U.S. for \nat least 5 years prior to the date of enactment of this legislation. If \nthey earn an advanced degree or serve our country in the Armed Forces, \nthey would then be granted permanent status and allowed to petition for \ncitizenship. Every student deserves a chance to learn and to serve a \ncause greater than him- or herself. This measure will give many \ndeserving children that opportunity.\n  The second provision would establish programs to help our neighbors \nto the south, including Guatemala and Belize to fight human smuggling \nand gain control of their tenuous borders. It would also encourage \nstrategic coordination across the hemisphere to fight the growing \nproblem of gang violence. In my view, these are critically important \nareas because in reality we can-not solve our problems here without \nalso addressing the roots of the problems abroad.\n  It remains to be seen what will happen to this bill when Senate \nconferees\n\n[[Page S5186]]\n\nsit down with our House colleagues to work out the considerable \ndifferences between the House and Senate versions of the bill. Speaking \nas one Senator, the measure as it has passed the Senate is a very \ndelicate package of compromises that just barely makes it acceptable. \nAny significant diminutions from the Senate package will make this \nmeasure unacceptable to me, and I suspect, to many of my colleagues. I \nurge the Senate conferees to stand fast to the Senate position.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, are we under unanimous consent agreement \nas to the speaking order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We finished with all the speakers on the \nunanimous consent order.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I seek recognition, then, in reference to \nthe bill before the Senate.\n  In the 200-plus year history of the Senate, there have been few \nmoments when Senators were called to reflect on an issue of this \ngravity. This issue of immigration goes to the heart and soul of this \nNation in which we live. It is an issue which has called forth from \neach side of the aisle the very best in debate, the very best in \nconsideration, to tackle one of the most complicated issues that has \never faced our Nation.\n  But it is not a new debate. It is not a new issue. Almost from its \noutset, America has grappled with this issue of immigration. We are a \nnation of immigrants. We are a diverse nation. Look around your own \nneighborhood, at your church, at the gallery, look around at your place \nof business, and you will see people from all over the world who at one \ntime or another came to this great Nation to call it home. With the \nexception of those Native Americans who were here when Christopher \nColumbus arrived, we are all newcomers to America. We are all strangers \nto this land. God has blessed us with this great opportunity to live in \nthis land of opportunity.\n  That immigrant spirit has meant so much to what we are today and why \nwe are different in this world, the courage of individual immigrants to \nleave behind everything--their home, their church, their relatives, \ntheir language, their culture, their friends--and to strike out for \nAmerica, to find that opportunity which meant so much to them.\n  I am a product of that immigrant spirit. My mother was an immigrant \nto this country. She came to the United States 95 years ago as a 2-\nyear-old infant, brought by her mother with her brother and sister. \nThey came from Lithuania and landed in Baltimore, MD. They found their \nway across the United States by train to St. Louis and then by wagon \nacross the Mississippi River on the old Eades Bridge to go to East St. \nLouis, IL, to join with other Lithuanian immigrants, immigrants who \nworked in the packinghouses, in the steel mills, in some of the hardest \njobs you could find.\n  Our family's story is a story that has been repeated millions of \ntimes over. I am sure my mother never would have dreamed in those early \ntimes when she was struggling with her family to make an immigrant home \nthat her son would one day represent the great State of Illinois. But \nthat is the story of America. And it is a story we should honor.\n  When I consider this debate and everything that has come to it--and I \nunderstand there are serious differences of opinion--I know this great \nNation cannot absorb every person who wants to come and live here. We \nare trying to find a reasonable way to deal with that yearning and \nspirit which drives so many people to our borders. I think we have a \ngood bill. It is not perfect by any means, but it is a good bill, with \nenforcement at the borders, enforcement in the workplace, and a fair \nprocess for people to earn their way, over a long period of time, \nfacing many obstacles, to legal status in America.\n  We would never have had that bill before the Senate were it not for \nthe bipartisan leadership in the Senate. I especially commend Senator \nTed Kennedy on our side of the aisle. What a warhorse. Whenever there \nis a battle in the Senate, you will find Ted Kennedy in the midst of \nit, bringing his special spirit, his special determination, as he has \nto this bill. His great ally in this cause has been Senator John McCain \nof Arizona of the opposite political faith but joining with him in this \neffort to come up with a good bill. And so many others whom I could go \nthrough the list and name, including Senator Specter, who led this \neffort in the Senate; Senator Leahy--without his help, we never would \nhave brought this bill out of the Senate Judiciary Committee; the four \nRepublicans, Senators who stood up in the Senate Judiciary Committee \nand said they would join the Democrats, did make this a bipartisan \neffort. When I look at those people and what they brought to this \ndebate, I see the best of the Senate.\n  It is rare--rare--that we come together, as we will see this \nafternoon, to face one of the most complicated and controversial issues \nin America and to do it in a bipartisan fashion, knowing full well that \nmany people think our efforts are futile, that it will fall on deaf \nears when we go over to conference with the House of Representatives.\n  I do not have that negative feeling. I really believe our friends in \nthe House of Representatives can also rise to the occasion and can \nunderstand this special moment in history that should not be lost.\n  Within the pages of this bill is a special provision I have worked on \nfor years, first with Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, and then with \nSenator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska. It is known as the DREAM Act. The \nDREAM Act is a provision which says if you were a child who came to the \nUnited States at least 5 years ago, and you graduate from high school \nand you are prepared to do one of two things--serve in the U.S. \nmilitary or go on to work toward a college degree--we will give you a \nchance, a chance to become an American citizen over a long period.\n  We call it the DREAM Act because that is what it is. I have seen \nthese young men and women in the city of Chicago and across the United \nStates. They did not select the United States as a home. They were \nbrought here by their parents. Many of them--most of them--are \nundocumented, but they still believe in their hearts they are Americans \nand can make this a better nation. The DREAM Act, which is included in \nthis bill, will give them that chance.\n  When I go to visit Cristo Rey High School in the city of Chicago and \nsee these wonderful young men and women who are defying the odds by \ncompleting their high school education, who want to go to college, who \nwant to be our doctors and engineers and scientists and businesspeople \nand lawyers and elected officials, I think to myself: America cannot \nafford to waste this great talent and this great resource.\n  This bill gives them a chance. This bill gives them hope. This bill \nallows them to have dreams that will be fulfilled.\n  This is a great moment in the Senate. I look forward to this vote and \nthe passage of this legislation. We will once again validate the \nAmerican dream that, yes, we are a Nation of immigrants, and, yes, we \nare an accepting and welcoming Nation that understands the people who \ncome to our shores and bring us diversity bring us strength, as Abraham \nLincoln once said, to replenish the stream. These are the people who \nwill build America's tomorrow. And these are the ones we serve with \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we are down to the final few minutes of \nwhat has been a long and complicated process but a very civil process--\nas some of my colleagues have referred to the process which has been a \nvery civil process in the best spirit of the Senate.\n  The Senate is about to vote at last on an issue that bears directly \non our core responsibility to make America a better place by making it \na safer place, a more secure place. It is an issue that focuses on our \nidentity as a nation, a bill that rises to the challenge of solving the \nproblem of illegal immigration with a plan that not only secures our \nborder but is a comprehensive plan that balances the needs of a growing \neconomy with our heritage as a land of proud immigrants.\n  This debate has been conducted in the Senate's finest tradition. \nSince I announced last October that the Senate would act this year, the \nunderstanding of this issue has increased, and increased every day we \nhave debated and discussed and voted. The\n\n[[Page S5187]]\n\nconversation both in Congress, in the Senate, and throughout the \ncountry has become more mature, more sophisticated, has led to a better \nunderstanding of the complexity of the challenge before us.\n  With this better understanding, the fact has become clearer and \nclearer: true border security combines energetic border enforcement \nwith a realistic program, a practical program which identifies who is \nin America today, which lays out firm but fair requirements for those \nwho want to be part of our great country.\n  Last fall, I had the opportunity, as so many have, to go to the \nborder. I went then to the Rio Grande border in Texas. The night before \nSenator Hutchison and I arrived, 800 illegal immigrants were arrested \nthere and were in detention the next morning, and over 200 pounds of \nmarijuana was seized. But you had to wonder how many more people \nslipped through unseen. Another 400, 500, 1,000, another 1,500, just \nthrough that one sector? Who were they? Where were they headed? What \nwere their intentions? What were their names? You had to wonder how \nmany might die crossing the desert, not knowing exactly where they were \ngoing to end up. How many pounds of drugs, in addition to that 200 \npounds of marijuana we witnessed, were making their way to the streets \nof Tennessee, New York, and California?\n  When I returned from Texas, I told the American people the Senate was \ngoing to act to make those borders more secure, to make our country \nsafer, to stop that hemorrhaging coming across every night. As one of \nthe major first orders of business in 2006, the Senate took up a strong \nborder security bill. I specifically outlined when we took up that bill \nthat over the ensuing days we would expand that bill to comprehensive \nimmigration reform.\n  First, the Senate needed to demonstrate we were going to fortify our \nborders. Next, we would strengthen worksite enforcement where the \nmagnet is attracting people across those borders. Third, we would \nestablish a strong, accountable temporary worker program. Fourth, we \nwould offer a plan for a path to citizenship that deals with the 12 \nmillion people, the diversity, that range of people, many who are fully \nassimilated into our society, some who over the last 6 months just \nsnuck across the border.\n  Today, I am proud to say the Senate has acted. We will vote here in a \nfew minutes. We have addressed what had seemingly started as an almost \ninsurmountable problem. We are acting with a comprehensive solution. It \nis not a perfect bill--we all understand that--but a bill that will \naccurately reflect the will of this Senate, the 100 Members in this \nSenate.\n  We took a bill to the Judiciary Committee and in a short period of \ntime, several months, generated a comprehensive bill. We took that bill \nto the Senate, amended it, and made it better. We have taken a bill \nthat the American people would have concluded was amnesty and, at least \nby my lights, we took the ``amnesty'' out while putting the \n``security'' in.\n  This bill we are about to pass has a 6-year plan to dramatically \nincrease the number of agents along that southern border, agents who \nare hired, who are trained, and who are deployed along that border to \nstop that hemorrhaging. With the amendment by Senator Sessions, we have \nagreed to build at least 370 miles of triple-layered fence, with \nanother 500 miles of vehicle barriers at strategic locations. This adds \nto provisions in the underlying bill which give the Border Patrol the \ntechnology and tools, the sophistication of technology we know they \nneed to make that border less porous. At last, we will have a long-term \nborder control strategy that will work and give us results to make \nAmerica safer, to make America more secure.\n  To further bolster border security, we approved an amendment to \nauthorize the National Guard to temporarily support border patrol \noperations. Coupled with the almost $2 billion in funds we approved in \nthe Senate last month to beef up that border patrol and building on the \nmoney we appropriated last year--almost $10 billion--to begin hiring \nnew agents, Americans should know the Senate is serious about stopping \nthat hemorrhaging coming across our borders.\n  We also moved to tackle another commonsense issue of national \ncohesion. The Senate voted in favor of an amendment by Senator Inhofe \nto require that English be declared the national language of the United \nStates. Learning to speak English is a necessary step for each and \nevery aspiring American to be successful and to join in the mainstream \nof American society.\n  If the American experiment is to succeed, built on common principles \nand civic duties, every person making their life in this country--all \nof them, all of us, native born and otherwise--needs to learn the \nlanguage, needs to learn the culture, needs to learn the history that \nbinds us as a people, as an American people.\n  As Americans, we are also bound by our right to vote in free and \ndemocratic elections. The bill before the Senate provides substantial \nreinforcement to our border and to the laws on the books. It also \nprovides a means for some to earn citizenship, while enforcing \nnecessary restrictions.\n  Illegal immigrants who have been in this country less than 2 years \nmust return home. Those who have been here 2 to 5 years would be \nrequired to come out of the shadows and leave the country, with the \nopportunity to legally return as temporary workers. Those who have been \nhere for 5 years or more will be eligible to begin an 11-year process \nto become citizens without uprooting and returning home. No one who \ncomes here illegally will reap the benefit of citizenship without first \ndemonstrating the commitment to earning, and no one who breaks our laws \nshould gain advantage over those who heeded them.\n  As I mentioned, this product is not perfect. Much more refinement \nneeds to be done. That can be done in conference. But without a doubt, \nthe amendments and the debate of the past 2 weeks have strengthened the \ncore of this bill. We have had at least 20 Republican amendments, at \nleast 18 Democrat amendments. A number of other amendments will be part \nof the managers' package. I am grateful to my colleagues for insisting \nthose amendments be heard.\n  I thank Senator Specter, who shepherded this bill through the \nJudiciary Committee, and Senators Hagel, Martinez, Kyl, Cornyn, and \nMcCain for standing with us all to insist on a fair process that \nallowed for free and open debate in amendments so we could move \nforward. I thank Senator Kennedy for helping all of us set a tone for a \ncivil, healthy debate. And I thank Senator Reid for, again, agreeing to \nopen and full debate. We have been in full agreement as to how \namendments would come forward; thus, both of us can be proud that, \nworking together, the bill we will be voting on in a few minutes does \naccurately reflect the spirit and the will of this Senate.\n  I do hope, as others have suggested this morning, as we turn to other \nissues, the same spirit with which this debate has been conducted will \ncontinue and will characterize our future deliberations in the Senate.\n  I also thank President Bush for his strong leadership for a \ncomprehensive solution to these challenging problems. From day one, he \nstaked out a position that was tough, not particularly popular when we \nstarted but one that was tough as well as compassionate, a position \nthat acknowledges the rich contributions of America's immigrants while \nrecognizing the need, first and foremost, to buttress our borders, that \nrespects our heritage as an immigrant nation while upholding the laws \nof the land.\n  Early on in this debate, I said:\n\n       This debate, and our effort, is about the American dream \n     and the hope that this country holds for so many hard-working \n     people.\n\n  But I should add, it is also an issue about what it means to be a \nnation. Every nation must keep its citizens safe and its borders \nsecure. We should not have to choose between respect for our history \nand respect for our laws. With hard work and responsible debate, we can \nhave both.\n  In this Senate, we have engaged in responsible debate over the last \nseveral months. We have worked hard. And with the bill before the \nSenate today, we do have both.\n  In closing, we are practical people. We are here to solve problems, \napplying the very best of my conservative principles, learning about \nthe best ways to act, setting deadlines, seeking action, not giving up \njust because\n\n[[Page S5188]]\n\nthings turn tough. That is the job of leadership in the Senate.\n  So much has been said and done in relation to this bill now, there is \nonly one thing left for us to do: vote, up or down. I will be voting \nyes, and I hope my 99 colleagues will also vote their conscience but \nalso in the affirmative. We are ready for the clerk to call the roll.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4083\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided on the Feingold amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the \nFeingold-Brownback amendment. This amendment will ensure that asylum \nseekers, victims of trafficking, and other immigrants can have \nmeaningful judicial review of removal orders.\n  The amendment would strike from the bill a provision that would have \nthe absurd result of making it harder, in many cases, for an immigrant \nto get a temporary stay of removal pending appeal than to actually win \non the merits of the case.\n  Let me state this in very clear terms. If this provision is not \nstruck from the bill, people with meritorious asylum claims will be \nsent back to countries where they will face persecution or even death \nbefore a Federal court can even hear their arguments.\n  Current law allows courts to deny stays to people with frivolous \nclaims who are using delay tactics. This provision, then, is a solution \nin search of a problem, and one that creates potentially devastating \nproblems of its own. The Senate should strike it from the bill.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A minute for and a minute against, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the earned-income tax credit is a major \ntransfer of wealth that we provide to American workers and their \nfamilies. It is a plan that has grown extraordinarily. The people who \nare illegally here now are not entitled to that plan. Just because they \nare legalized, they should not have an automatic right to obtain those \nbenefits. If they are here until citizenship, they are entitled to \nthose benefits. As a matter of law, they would be entitled to that. It \namounts to, I believe, $40 billion over the next 10 years. It is \nsomething that we need to take seriously.\n  This $40 billion will increase our debt by that much in the next 10 \nyears. We are generous with health care and with education and to allow \noverwhelmingly these people to stay in our country. But they are not \nentitled to this welfare benefit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, what we are saying is when immigrants are \ngoing to be legal immigrants, they are going to pay income tax, and \nunder the Sessions amendment they are going to say you are going to pay \nyour taxes, but you are not going to be able to take the earned-income \ntax credit. Your two children may be American citizens, but under the \nSessions amendment, you will not be able to take the earned-income tax \ncredit because you have not effectively became a citizen, even though \nyou are legally here and paying taxes.\n  This is a special punitive tax provision that will be unique only to \nthose individuals. It is wrong and it is unfair, and this amendment \nshould be defeated.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nAlabama, Mr. Sessions.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4136\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes equally divided on the Ensign amendment. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, just so people understand the difference \nbetween this amendment and the amendment we just voted on, when folks \nwere here illegally, a lot of them used fraudulent Social Security \nnumbers, some of them had stolen IDs and ruined lives with these stolen \nidentifications. This amendment says that even though that is a felony \nand this bill gives them amnesty for that felony, we think that is \nenough. We don't think one of these illegal immigrants should be able \nto come back, instead of paying back taxes and qualify for EITC and all \nthe other tax credits available to them.\n  Uncle Sam is saying: We are going to give you citizenship, permanent \nresidency, we are going to forgive the felony of using a Social \nSecurity number fraudulently, and also, now you qualify for tax \ncredits, and so the American taxpayers are going to have to write you a \ncheck. I think that is wrong. That is why my colleagues should support \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, my very good friend from Nevada is driven \nby what he thinks is fair and right. I have a totally different view. \nHere is what I think is fair and right: Punish people appropriate to \nthe crime; don't take tax policy and connect it to criminal law.\n  What we are saying people right now is: pay your taxes, learn \nEnglish, pay a fine. But let's not come up with tax policy for one \ngroup of people who are now legal and say: You have to pay, but you \ndon't get what anybody else in the country legally gets, and we have \nmade you legal.\n  What damage are we going to do? We are going to take the tax law and \nturn it upside down and focus on one group and kick them around after \nthey do everything else that everybody else has to do. That is not the \nbest of this country. That is not consistent with the punishment versus \nthe crime. Why would we ask somebody to pay their taxes and then say: \nThanks for the money; you don't get any other benefits in the Tax Code. \nRapists, murderers, and thieves go to jail, but they get refunds if the \nTax Code says so. The only people who are not going to get a refund \nafter they pay the taxes is this group of people working hard? That is \nnot right.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 4136. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Wyoming (Mr. Enzi).\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senate is not in order.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4188\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I think we have finally cleared away all \nof the underbrush on the managers' package. All I can say with the \nmanagers' package is it makes sausage look very good, but I think we \nare ready to proceed to a vote on a managers' package. People have \nasked for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have an inquiry through the Chair. I \nthought it was possible, though I would not need 10 minutes, not having \nspoken on the bill, to ask for 10 minutes simply to point out a couple \nof things in the managers' package, including the fact that the U.S. \nGovernment would be required to consult with the Mexican Government \nbefore building any fences on the border.\n  Would I be able to ask for time to discuss anything in the managers' \npackage at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator could seek approval by unanimous \nconsent.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for that courtesy.\n  The managers' amendment has been negotiated right up to the last \nsecond. It is hard to know exactly everything that is in it. I am told \nby staff that among the provisions is one which:\n\n        . . . requires Federal, State and local representatives in \n     the United States to consult with their counterparts in \n     Mexico concerning the construction of additional fencing and \n     related border security structures along the U.S.-Mexico \n     border before the commencement of any such construction to, \n     No. 1, solicit the views of affected communities; No. 2, \n     lessen tensions; and, No. 3, foster greater understanding and \n     stronger cooperation on this and other important security \n     issues of mutual concern.\n\n  I am all for consulting with the Mexican Government on matters of \nmutual concern, but I do not think it is necessary for us to put as a \nprecondition into the building of any fencing structures the \nrequirement that the U.S. Government consult with the Government of \nMexico. For that reason among others, I will be voting against the \nmanagers' package.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President I listened to the remarks of Senator Kyl \nconcerning the inclusion in the managers' package of the holding of \nconsultations at Federal, State and local levels on both sides of \nborder before fence construction occurs. I think I know something about \nthis issue because it was my amendment. Senator Kyl suggested in his \nremarks that consultations would give the Mexican Government veto power \nover the building of a fence. Nothing could be farther from the truth, \nand nothing in that amendment would impede the ability of the U.S. \nGovernment to construct a fence in manner the of our choosing.\n  But it is simply common sense and common courtesy to consult those \nindividuals in our own communities and\n\n[[Page S5190]]\n\nin affected communities on the other side of the border before \nconstructing a fence. Why? Because the fence alone is not going to stop \nthe flow of illegal immigration into the United States. It is going to \ntake a cooperative effort between the United States and Mexico. My \namendment seeks to foster the kind of cooperation that is vital if we \nare going to once and for all secure our borders.\n  I thank the President for the opportunity to clarify this matter.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I send the managers' package to the desk \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter], for himself \n     and Mr. Kennedy, proposes an amendment numbered 4188.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman, Senator Specter, and \nSenator Leahy for accepting my amendment, which would help thousands of \nreligious minorities who have come to the United States seeking relief \nfrom the persecution they faced in Iraq.\n  Currently in the United States, approximately 3,000 Christian \nIraqis--about 2,000 of whom are in the metropolitan Detroit area--are \nin jeopardy of being deported. These are persons with no criminal \nrecord who came to the United States seeking asylum during the regime \nof Saddam Hussein. Due to the long delays in the immigration system, \nhowever, their cases were not heard before April 30, 2003, when the \nUnited States declared victory in Iraq. When these individuals finally \nhad their day in court, the immigration judge denied their application \nbecause the government in Iraq that persecuted these individuals was no \nlonger in power.\n  These Iraqi Christians had valid claims for asylum when the came \nhere, they have been hard-working, law abiding residents over many \nyears, and they have put down roots and raised families here. They \nshould not be punished for the bureaucratic backlogs of the immigration \njudicial system.\n  My amendment would protect persecuted religious minorities who fled \nSaddam Hussein's oppressive government in Iraq and came to the United \nStates with valid claims of asylum and for whom, despite the change in \ngovernment regime, it is not safe to return to their homeland. The \npersecuted religious minorities are defined as someone who is or was a \nnational or resident of Iraq, is a member of a religious minority in \nIraq, and shares common characteristics with other minorities in Iraq \nwho have been targets of persecution on account of race, religion, \nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political \nopinion. My amendment would make these individuals eligible for legal \npermanent residency status and would supersede all previous judicial \naction on their cases.\n  I am pleased that we are able to provide relief to these individuals \nwho deserve legal permanent residency on the merits of their cases but \nwere unfairly denied it because of bureaucratic delays that were beyond \ntheir control.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. SPECTER.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, our immigration system is broken and needs \nto\n\n[[Page S5191]]\n\nbe repaired. This bill is a strong step in the right direction. We need \nto protect our borders and look out for American workers, and we also \nneed a responsible way to meet the need for temporary workers, \nparticularly in the agricultural area, where they represent about 70 \npercent of the U.S. agricultural workforce, with a path to earned \ncitizenship for hard-working, law abiding temporary workers. This bill, \nthe product of bipartisan compromise, takes a commonsense approach to \nall of these issues.\n  The comprehensive immigration reform bill before us today would \nstrengthen security at our borders through increased border patrol and \nheavier fines for employers who violate the law. It would create a \nsustainable temporary worker program to help fill the lowest wage jobs. \nIt would enforce labor protections for U.S. workers by ensuring that \nthe temporary workers who are certified do not adversely impact them. \nAnd it would provide a path to earned citizenship that does not bump \nanybody who has applied through the legal channels and has been \nwaiting. Undocumented immigrants who have been here for years, set down \nroots, worked hard, and paid their taxes would go to the end of the \nline and earn citizenship after perhaps as many as 10 to 15 years.\n  I am pleased that we were able to include additional protections for \nU.S. workers in the bill. I supported an amendment introduced by \nSenator Obama that strengthens labor protections for U.S. workers and \nbars employers from hiring guest workers in areas with a high \nunemployment rate. This and other amendments will help ensure that we \nhave a well-balanced, and workable guest worker program. In addition to \nthese amendments, I am also pleased that we have maintained the AgJOBS \nprovision within the bill. This provision is a commonsense fix to major \nproblems being faced by those who have the least access to resources: \nlow wage agricultural workers from exploitation which would adversely \nimpact American workers.\n  I was pleased that the Senate recognized the significant \nimplementation challenges associated with the Western Hemisphere Travel \nInitiative and accepted an amendment that would extend its deadline. \nThe WHTI requires anyone entering the United States via a U.S.-Canadian \nland border to have a passport or other acceptable alternative document \nby January 1, 2008. The amendment accepted by the Senate extends this \ndeadline by 18 months to June 1, 2009.\n  My home State of Michigan, like other northern border States, enjoys \na close economic and social relationship with Canada. The WHTI will \nplay an important role in securing our borders, but it must be \nimplemented in a reasonable, fair, and well thought out manner that \nminimizes negative impacts on trade, travel, and tourism. By voting to \nextend the deadline, we are giving the Departments of State and \nHomeland Security additional time to study and correct the various \nimplementation issues related to the WHTI.\n  I am also pleased that the immigration bill addresses another key \nborder issue: the security problem that is posed by trash trucks \nentering this country. My amendment, which was accepted by the bill \nmanagers, would stop the importation of Canadian waste if the \nDepartment of Homeland Security can not show that the methodologies and \ntechnologies used to screen these trash trucks for the presence of \nchemical, nuclear, biological, and radiological weapons are as \neffective as those used to screen for such materials in other items of \ncommerce entering the United States by commercial vehicle.\n  Finally, I want to thank the managers of this bill for accepting my \namendment that would protect thousands of individuals who fled \nreligious persecution in Iraq under Saddam Hussein. Due to delays in \nthe immigration bureaucracy, many of these individuals have not yet had \ntheir day in court, and, of those who have, many have been denied \nasylum based on changed country conditions since the war. My amendment \nwould make these individuals eligible for legal permanent residency if \nthey would have received that status but for the bureaucratic delays.\n  The comprehensive immigration bill before us will make our borders \nmore secure while creating a workable temporary worker program that \nprotects U.S. jobs. I will support this bill and hope that the \nconference committee will return a final bill similar to it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/25/senate-section/article/S5191-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5191-S5208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF BRETT M.

On this vote, the ayes are 67, the nays are \n30. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Parliamentary inquiry: Is it appropriate now to begin \ndebate on the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is appropriate.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I support the confirmation of Brett \nKavanaugh to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia because \nof his academic achievements, professional work, and potential to be an \noutstanding Federal judge.\n  Brett Kavanaugh was an honors graduate from Yale University, was a \ngraduate of the Yale Law School, and a member of the Law Journal there. \nThat is a strong indication of intellectual achievement. He then \nclerked for\n\n[[Page S5192]]\n\nJudge Walter Stapleton of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit \nand then Judge Alex Kozinski of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth \nCircuit and then clerked for Justice Kennedy on the Supreme Court of \nthe United States. Those are really outstanding credentials, \nacademically and for the beginning career of a young lawyer. He then \nworked in the Solicitor General's Office, argued a case before the \nSupreme Court of the United States, and then worked as associate White \nHouse counsel and has been Secretary to President Bush.\n  He had a second hearing which was requested by the Democrats so that \nhe could respond to questions which had arisen in the 2-year interim \nsince his first hearing, and he responded by allaying any concerns \nabout any involvement which he may have had on the subject of \ninterrogation of detainees.\n  He was asked about any potential participation in the \nadministration's electronics surveillance program. He answered that in \nthe negative.\n  He responded to questions with respect to the subject of rendition, \nagain with no knowledge on his part of any of that.\n  He was subject to close questioning about his work with Kenneth Starr \non the impeachment proceeding, and he was not in a position of \nleadership. He was one of several down the tier, with Mr. Starr being \nIndependent Counsel. Mr. Kavanaugh was a deputy, with as many as nine \nother such deputies on his level.\n  He was candid in some criticism of the handling of the matter; the \npublic release of the report was not the choosing of Independent \nCounsel. He testified that he believed that the Independent Counsel \nstatute ought to be changed materially if it was to be revised and that \nhaving Mr. Starr both on Whitewater and the impeachment of the \nPresident was too much.\n  He wrote a law review article on the issue of peremptory challenges \nfor Black jurors and took the position that it was inappropriate, \nshould not be done, and displayed in that scholarly aptitude on the \njournal.\n  One of the objections raised to Mr. Kavanaugh involved how close he \nwas to the President. But it is hardly a surprise that Brett Kavanaugh \nwould be close to the President because the President selects people in \nwhom he has confidence and who share his approach to jurisprudence, to \nstrict construction, and to not legislating from the bench. That \nprerogative of the President is what Presidential elections are about.\n  Some of Mr. Kavanaugh's answers were hesitant, and I think he was \nvery concerned about being very precise in what he had to say. He might \nhave been a little forthcoming, but in a context where there is a \nquestion about subsequent investigations, if the control of the Senate \nchanges, in the context of witnesses appearing before grand juries on \nfive occasions, looking for inconsistencies, it is understandable that \nhe was very cautious in his comments.\n  I believe that on this record, Brett M. Kavanaugh ought to be \nconfirmed, and I urge my colleagues to vote in the affirmative.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I have some remarks I would like to make \non this nomination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for just a moment? He does have the \nfloor, I fully understand. I assume we would follow the normal order \nthat after the chairman spoke, the ranking member would be allowed to \nspeak.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will be glad to defer to the ranking member.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from Texas has the floor. He does have the \nfloor.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I recognize I have the floor and the right \nto the floor, but I will be glad to accommodate the ranking member and, \nif I can, by unanimous consent, request that I be recognized after he \nspeaks, I would be happy to relinquish the floor to him.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I certainly have no objection to that. I assume what we \nwill probably do for the rest of the evening, and I suspect we probably \nwill do the same thing tomorrow--hopefully by tomorrow night or early \nSaturday we will finish--we will go back and forth. I make a request I \nbe recognized, and upon the completion of my remarks, the distinguished \nSenator from Texas be recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Only for the purpose of being in the queue after the \nSenator from Texas, if I can amend the unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Durbin follow the \nSenator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, and I do not \nwish to object, I presume this is a discussion on the nominee. Senator \nDayton and I have a bill we want to introduce. It will take just 3 or 4 \nminutes to comment on the introduction.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that before I am \nrecognized--the Senator from Texas still has the floor--before I am \nrecognized and the Senator from Texas is recognized and then the \nSenator from Illinois is recognized and then the Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized, that 10 minutes be divided between the Senator from \nMississippi and the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Will that give Senator Lott and Senator Dayton enough time?\n  Mr. LOTT. That will be more than enough time. That is very generous.\n  Mr. LEAHY. That upon yielding back of the time of the Senator from \nMississippi and the Senator from Minnesota, the Senator from Vermont be \nrecognized following the chain we talked about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. May I just add to that unanimous consent request that \nSenator Hatch be added as the next speaker on our side of the aisle in \nthe queue?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have no objection to that. I think it is quite \nappropriate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe Senator Dayton will actually \nintroduce the legislation, and I join as a cosponsor. He will lead off \nwith his remarks, and then I will be honored to follow.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dayton and Mr. Lott pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 3239 are printed in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota and the \nSenator from Mississippi, and I thank again the distinguished Senator \nfrom Texas, who has shown his usual and normal courtesy in allowing me \nto go next.\n  The Senate has just passed bipartisan comprehensive immigration \nreform. I think that is an achievement for all Americans, present and \nfuture, who want to keep our country safe, and it fixes what most will \nacknowledge is a broken system. I mention that because the Senate, \nRepublicans and Democrats, worked together to speak about one of \nAmerica's top priorities, and it worked. I think the American public \nunderstands that. We ought to continue that. We ought to continue that \non the path of addressing Americans' top priorities.\n  We ought to be debating the war in Iraq. None of us can go home \nwithout hearing a debate on the war in Iraq, either for or against it. \nWe ought to be debating it on the floor of the Senate. We are, after \nall, the conscience of the Nation. We should be debating the war in \nIraq.\n  We should debate the rising gas prices. You can't go into a diner in \nAmerica without hearing a debate on that. They ask the same thing: Why \naren't you debating it on the floor of the Senate?\n  How about the health care costs, which are going up at a time when \nseniors are faced with what for many of them is an incomprehensible \nprescription medicine plan. We ought to be talking about that. You \ncan't go to the senior center anywhere in the country without hearing \nthat being debated.\n\n[[Page S5193]]\n\nWhat is wrong with the Senate, the conscience of the Nation, debating \nit?\n  How about stem cell research? So many parents of children with \ndiabetes, those who have had paralyzing injuries, they say: Why aren't \nyou at least determining a way to have stem cell research?\n  What about the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act? Not only has \nthe Voting Rights Act worked to help those minorities in this country \nwho were denied the right to vote before, but let us make sure that it \nworks in the future for children today, Hispanic children today, \nAfrican-American children today, the children of all races? How will we \nguarantee they will have the right to vote? We should reauthorize the \nVoting Rights Act.\n  These are all things on which the Senate could come together in a \nbipartisan fashion. We could have a bipartisan debate. The country \nwould benefit by it. We would be a better body. The country would be \nbetter. But instead, it appears that because it is an election year, \nthen we have to go to controversial, polarizing judicial nominations.\n  This nomination, like the difficult and controversial nominations of \nJudge Terrence Boyle and Michael Wallace, signifies that the Bush-\nCheney administration and those who support it here in the Senate, are \nmore interested in playing partisan election-year politics by heeding \nthe siren call of special interest groups rather than tackling the \npressing issues facing Americans today.\n  Local and national law enforcement have called upon the President to \nwithdraw the nomination of Judge Boyle, as I have, and he would be well \nadvised to do so. The nomination of Michael Wallace received the first \nABA rating of unanimously ``not qualified'' for a circuit court nominee \nin more than 20 years. The last one to get that rating didn't go \nthrough. And the nomination before us today of Brett Kavanaugh is one \nof the few judicial nominations to be downgraded over time by the ABA.\n  The Senate's job is to fulfill our duty under the Constitution, not \nto advance a political agenda. No matter what our political \naffiliation, we are supposed to consider the interests of all \nAmericans. We have to be able to assure the American people that the \njudges confirmed to lifetime appointments to the highest courts in this \ncountry are being appointed fairly to protect their interests, rather \nthan to be a rubberstamp for whichever President nominated them. Mr. \nKavanaugh is a nice young man who was nominated for the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit after working for most of \nhis career in behalf of the Bush-Cheney administration and the \nRepublican Party in partisan, political jobs. Since helping to author \nthe Kenneth Starr Report, he has worked in the office of the White \nHouse Counsel and as staff secretary to the Bush-Cheney administration. \nHe was involved in the administration's use of 750 Presidential signing \nstatements to try to reserve to the President the power to pick and \nchoose which laws passed by Congress he wanted to follow. In other \nwords, he allowed the President to sign a bill but then say: This law \nmay apply to others, but it is not going to apply to the President or \nanybody else to whom I don't want it to apply. It is the first time in \nmy lifetime a President has stated so emphatically, 750 times: I am \nabove the law. He has helped the President pack the Federal bench with \nright-wing ideologues.\n  He has helped design the White House's overbearing secrecy policy. So \nnow we are spending billions of dollars in marking things ``top \nsecret,'' some of which were on Government Web sites for long periods \nof time until they realized it was pointing out embarrassing mistakes \nin the Bush-Cheney administration. So they yanked it off the Web sites \nand marked it ``top secret.'' We even have now the FBI going to a dead \njournalist--to a dead journalist, Jack Anderson--and pressuring his \nelderly widow to give up his notes of 20 and 30 years ago because it \nmight prove embarrassing to some in their party.\n  So my question for this nominee, which is the same question I have \nasked of all nominees of either party, is whether you will be an \nindependent check and balance.\n  I recall recommending to President Clinton a well-known Republican \nfrom my State for a seat on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. I did \nthat even though the man is certainly more conservative than I and \nbelonged to the other party. I did it because I knew he would be \nindependent; he would not be a rubberstamp for any President, \nRepublican or Democratic.\n  Regrettably, Mr. Kavanaugh has failed through two hearings to \nestablish that he has the capacity to be an independent check on his \npolitical patron, in this case a President who is asserting \nextraordinary claims of power. In fact, despite his close ties to the \nWhite House's inner circle, he wouldn't even tell us what issues he \nwould recuse himself from hearing as a judge. We asked him \nspecifically: Here is a case where you designed the legal basis for \nsomething, and now it comes before you as a judge; would you recuse or \nrule on work you have done? He wouldn't even acknowledge that he would. \nInstead we heard from a nominee who parroted the Bush-Cheney \nadministration's talking points on subject after subject. I don't think \nthe Senate should confirm a Presidential spokesperson to be a judge of \nthe second highest court in the land.\n  After carefully evaluating Mr. Kavanaugh's record and his answers at \ntwo hearings, it is clear that he is a political pick being pushed for \npolitical reasons. His nomination is a continuation of the Republicans' \ndecade-long attempt to pack the DC Circuit.\n  You can go all the way back to President Clinton's first term when \nthe Republicans started playing politics with the DC Circuit. They \nblocked President Clinton's nominees so they could make sure they had a \nmajority of Republican appointees on the court. They were among the 61 \nof President Clinton's nominees that the Republicans pocket \nfilibustered. And their plan succeeded. After confirming two other \nnominees last year whom I strongly opposed--Janice Rogers Brown and \nThomas Griffith--Republican nominees now comprise a 2-to-1 majority on \nthe second most important court in the land. This is not a court which \nneeds another rubberstamp for this President's assertions of Executive \npower.\n  The Republican majority who chose to shrink the court when there was \na Democratic President is now bent on packing this court. They want \nthis up-or-down vote even though they didn't apply that standard or \nanything near it to President Clinton's nominees to the DC Circuit. As \nI say, they denied 61 of President Clinton's nominees an up-or-down \nvote. When they stalled the nomination of Merrick Garland to the DC \nCircuit beyond the 1996 election, even Senator Hatch as chairman of the \ncommittee became frustrated. He claimed the way the Republicans were \nopposing judicial nominees was playing politics with judges, was \nunfair, and he was sick of it. I wish he had followed through instead \nof joining with his fellow Republicans in denying 61 judges an up-or-\ndown vote. We did finally get Merrick Garland through, but he was the \nlast one the Republicans were willing to consider for confirmation to \nthis important circuit.\n  Here we have a person with no real experience other than being \nwilling to take political orders.\n  Let me tell you about two of the nominees of President Clinton whom \nthe Republicans would not allow to have a vote, a so-called pocket \nfilibuster. One was Elena Kagan. They wouldn't allow her to come to a \nvote. Some even said: We are not sure of her qualifications. She is now \ndean of the Harvard Law School. These are the same people pushing a \nnominee for the Fifth Circuit, as I mentioned earlier, who is rated \nunanimously unqualified. And they pocket filibustered Alan Snyder. He \nhad served as a clerk to Justice Rehnquist--no screaming liberal he, \nGod rest his soul. Mr. Snyder was an experienced and respected \nlitigator, but he was pocket filibustered. The fact is, for the rest of \nPresident Clinton's second term, they blocked all nominees to the DC \nCircuit, pocket filibustered them all with impunity.\n  I will give a little background. During the 17 months I was chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee, I tried to stop the poisonous pocket \nfilibustering. I am a Democrat, and the Bush-Cheney administration is \nRepublican. In 17 months, I moved through, and the Democratic-\ncontrolled Senate moved through, 100 of President Bush's nominees. We \nactually moved them faster than the Republicans had moved them for a \nRepublican President.\n\n[[Page S5194]]\n\n  But I don't want to say they rubberstamped everybody. They, the \nRepublicans, actually did treat one nominee the same way they treated \nPresident Clinton's. It is the way they treated White House Counsel \nHarriet Miers when the President nominated her.\n  She is a woman who has not gone to Ivy League schools but has a more \nimpressive background and experience than this nominee--certainly much \nmore legal experience than this nominee. Republicans questioned her \nqualifications. They demanded answers about her work at the White House \nand her legal philosophy. They would meet on an off-the-record basis \nwith the press and say what a terrible nomination this was for \nPresident Bush to make.\n  I said: At least let her have a hearing. All Democrats on the \ncommittee said: Out of fairness to the President, we ought to let his \nnominee have a hearing. The Republicans said: She is not going to get a \nhearing, and they forced the President to withdraw her nomination.\n  Despite the political battle, as I said when I moved through 100 of \nPresident Bush's nominees, I approached the nomination of Mr. Kavanaugh \nwith an open mind. I gave him the chance that Elena Kagan and Alan \nSnyder never received. In fact, he has had more opportunities than \nthey. He has had an opportunity to demonstrate at not one but two \nhearings that he could be an independent nominee who deserved to be \nconfirmed.\n  The Washington Post noted in 2003, when President Bush nominated Mr. \nKavanaugh, that he had nominated somebody ``who will only inflame \nfurther the politics of confirmation to one of this country's highest-\nquality courts'' and concluded that it was ``too bad Mr. Bush is too \nbusy playing politics to lead.'' I agree. Instead of being an uniter, \nhe is being a divider.\n  I kept an open mind, even though only 1 of the 22 judges appointed to \nthe D.C. Circuit since the Nixon administration, Kenneth Starr, had \neven less legal experience at the time of his nomination than \nKavanaugh. Throughout all Republican and Democratic Presidents, only \nKenneth Starr had less experience since President Nixon's time than Mr. \nKavanaugh.\n  I even kept an open mind after Mr. Kavanaugh's nomination was one of \nthe few to be downgraded by the ABA. I can't recall anyone being \nconfirmed after such a development.\n  But after I saw Mr. Kavanaugh at his recent hearing, I could \nappreciate one judge interviewed by the ABA peer review subcommittee \ndescribing Mr. Kavanaugh as ``less than adequate'' and someone who \n``demonstrated experience on the level of an associate.'' Others \ninterviewed recently raised concerns about Mr. Kavanaugh's ability to \nbe balanced and fair, given his years in partisan positions, working to \nadvance a particular partisan political agenda. He was described by \ninterviewees as ``sanctimonious,'' ``immovable and very stubborn and \nfrustrating to deal with on some issues''--not the qualities that make \nfor a good judge.\n  Despite the word put out falsely by the Bush-Cheney defenders, it was \nnot a change in membership in the ABA peer review committee that led to \nhis downgrading. Three-quarters of those who previously reviewed this \nnomination, and continued on the committee, voted to downgrade the \nrating based on the recent interviews and review.\n\n  His response to one very simple question I asked during his most \nrecent hearing spoke volumes. I asked the nominee why he had taken 7 \nmonths to answer the written questions submitted to him following his \ninitial hearing in 2004. He repeated the meaningless phrase that he \n``took responsibility'' for such dismissive and irresponsible conduct \nand, implicitly, for his lack of seriousness about the confirmation. \nWhen he did that, it actually elicited laugher from the hearing room \nbut not laughter from me because I felt it was not the first time he \n``dissembled'' in response to my questions.\n  I suspect the truth is, he made a political calculation and decided \nto expend his time and effort at his benefactor's reelection campaign \nduring the spring, summer, and fall of 2004 rather than answering the \nquestions legitimately asked by Senators on the Judiciary Committee. He \nmay be brilliant at politics and have powerful supporters, but that \ndoesn't mean he will be a good judge. This is, after all, a vote to \ndetermine not who your supporters are or not how good you have been at \npartisan politics but how good a judge you will be.\n  In my opening statement at his hearing, I raised a key question \nregarding this nomination: Will he demonstrate his independence and \nshow he can serve in the last independent branch of the Government? One \nparty controls the White House, the Senate, the House of \nRepresentatives. There is only one body left to be independent. That is \nthe courts. Can we look to him to be a check and balance on the \nPresident, who is asserting extraordinary claims of power, or on any \nPresident?\n  He could have told us something about his responsibilities as staff \nsecretary or as an associate White House counsel, giving us examples \nwhen he showed independence and good judgment, but he didn't. Instead, \nhe appeared at his confirmation hearing to be a spokesman and \nrepresentative for the administration. Instead of speaking about how \nindependent he would be, he basically over and over again acted like a \nspokesman for the administration.\n  Courts are not supposed to be owned by the White House. I don't care \nwhich administration is in control of the White House, they are not \nsupposed to control the courts. Over and over he answered our questions \nby alluding to what the President would want and what the President \nwould want him to do. We are going to confirm somebody who, in sworn \nstatements, talks about how he would try to make sure he ruled as the \nPresident would want him to rule? Have we really sunk that low in the \nSenate on judicial nominations?\n  We heard from a nominee who responded not with independent answers \nbut with the administration's talking points. We heard from a young man \nwho, when invited by the chairman to introduce his family, began his \nremarks not by introducing the family but by thanking the President for \nnominating him and later emphasized--as if that was a qualification--\nthat he had ``earned the trust of the President'' and his ``senior \nstaff.''\n  I have no problem with the President nominating Republicans--although \nthat seems to be all he will nominate, unlike other Presidents of both \nparties who have nominated people from both parties--but I expect him \nto nominate somebody who can be independent and will not have his \nstrings pulled by the White House. It may be useful for advancement \nwithin the Bush-Cheney administration in Republican circles, but they \nare not qualifications for a judge who can be independent if he is \nasked to rule on this President's or the Bush-Cheney administration's \npolicies.\n  Senator Graham put the question this way during the course of the \nhearing: ``There is a fine line between doing your job as a White House \ncounsel and being part of the judicial selection team and being a judge \nyourself. There is a line between being an advocate and being a \njudge.'' I don't believe he showed he knows that line. The DC Circuit \nis too important to pack with those who would merely rubberstamp the \nBush-Cheney administration or any administration, Democratic or \nRepublican. We can't rubberstamp an administration's policies.\n  We had the sudden and basically forced resignation of the President's \nhandpicked head of the CIA, Porter Goss. America witnessed another \n``heck of a job'' accolade to an administration insider leaving a \ncritical job undone. This administration insider--we saw what a great \njob he did. So, like administration insiders who ran FEMA right after \nHurricane Katrina, the President said they had done a heck of a job. I \nthink virtually all Americans, Republican and Democratic, would \ndisagree. In fact, for that matter, this week we learned that the \nPresident's Secretary of the Veterans' Administration was in charge \nwhen there was the largest theft of private information from the \nGovernment ever--the largest theft ever, the loss of information on \nmore than 26 million American veterans.\n  Compounding the incompetence is the misguided decision by the \nVeterans' Administration for secrecy in trying to cover it up for the \nlast 3 weeks. Boy, if we don't talk about it, if we cover it up, maybe \nnobody will know that we lost the critical private information of 26 \nmillion veterans.\n\n[[Page S5195]]\n\n  This is falling on the heels of last year's debacle of the $1 billion \nshortfall in the VA's budget for veterans health care by the same \nleadership, who said: Oh, we have plenty of money when they want to \nmake political points, then quietly to the Congress after, saying: \nWhoops, we don't. It is a heck of a job. It is just one more heck of a \njob by this administration.\n  Maybe we should have a ``heck of a job'' medal to give to all of \nthese people who get fired for incompetence--give them a ``heck of a \njob'' medal--great big thing, you have done a heck of a job. It is a \nheck of a job on Katrina; it is a heck of a job on rubberstamping \nnominees for the courts; it is a heck of a job when you lose 26 million \nrecords and put these veterans at great risk. Oh, wait a minute. They \ndid say they would have an 800 number. If you are 1 of the 26 million \nnow facing identity theft, maybe lose your car, maybe lose your house, \nmaybe lose your pension, maybe lose your life savings, we have an 800 \nnumber for you.\n  Anybody try to get through to that 800 number? If you do, they tell \nyou go out and buy protection. Whatever happened with ``the buck stops \nhere''? It has to be more than photo-ops when you run operations.\n  What is desperately lacking throughout this administration is \naccountability. The attack on 9/11 happened on their watch. You don't \nsee accountability. The faulty intelligence, the years of fundamental \nmistakes in Iraq, hundreds of billions of dollars spent in the war in \nIraq, and we were told that we were going to be greeted as liberators \nand that it would be over in a matter of days. The lack of preparation, \nthe horrific aftermath of Katrina, and on and on--billions spent on \nhomeland security.\n  First, a crony of the President was going to be put in to run the \nDepartment of Homeland Security until they found out the very \ndisturbing things about his personal life; found out things that the \nadministration knew about, that they were trying to keep secret. But \nwhen the press found out about it, somebody had an excuse not to go \nthere.\n  Be ready on a moment's notice if we are ever attacked again, like we \nwere attacked early on in the Bush-Cheney administration. Well, with \nKatrina, we had days and days and days of notice. It didn't do any \ngood.\n  I think, speaking in behalf of the President for a moment, it is not \nall his fault. He has not been helped by the Republican-controlled \nCongress that won't provide any checks and balances. The Republican \ncontrolled Congress won't raise the questions that might be asked, and \nthat, had they been asked, might have forced the administration to do a \nbetter job. But the Republican-controlled Congress won't serve as a \ncheck and balance, when there are colossal failures of homeland \nsecurity, or at the VA, or anywhere else. Can we at least ask for the \ncourts to be a check and balance to preserve our rights and our way of \nlife? If our Government overreaches, at least we can count on the \ncourts to be there to check and balance.\n  In fact, now that the administration is raiding congressional \noffices, the Republican leadership in Congress is finally protesting. \nWhen ordinary Americans' telephone calls and Internet use is being \nwiretapped without warrants, that same Republican leadership looked the \nother way. I guess they had to tread on the toes of Members of Congress \nbefore the Republican Congress will say anything.\n  Last year, when the President nominated Harriet Miers, Republicans \nquestioned her qualifications and demanded answers about her work at \nthe White House and her legal philosophy. They defeated her nomination \nwithout a hearing. Now it appears that they are back to their \nrubberstamping routine with every Senate Republican ready to approve \nthis nomination without question or pause.\n  Then we ask the question: The President's counsel, the staff \nsecretary, did that nominee act as a check and balance, or will he \ncontinue, as he said at his hearing, to do whatever the President \nwanted?\n  At his hearing, Senator Feinstein and I gave him another opportunity \nto answer concern about his loyalty to the President. We asked about \nrecusal. He could have said he would not hear any matter that raised \nquestions about the President's claims of executive power insofar as \nwas involved with the development of the policies and practices of the \nBush-Cheney administration. It is almost judicial ethics 101 in the \nfirst year of law school. The easy answer is: Of course, I will not \nrule on that. Of course, I would recuse myself on something I have \ndeveloped in the White House. He could have walled off matters covered \nby the Presidential signing statement--750 of them. This President has \nshown unchecked Executive power exceeding that of Richard Nixon. He \ncould have said that given his role in the development of this \nadministration's secrecy policies he would recuse himself from those \nquestions regarding the right of the American people to know about \ntheir Government. It would not only be the right answer, but it would \nbe an easy answer. After all, the administration stacked that court \nwith so many Republicans, he should feel comfortable, but even there he \ndidn't say he would follow basic judicial ethics.\n  At a time when the Senate should be addressing America's top \npriorities, the President and his Senate allies instead are trying to \ndivide and distract from fixing real problems by pressing forward with \nthis controversial unqualified nomination.\n  We showed in the recent debate that at least among senior Members--\nRepublican and Democratic Members--we could be uniters and not \ndividers.\n  Unfortunately, in this case, the White House wants to be dividers not \nuniters. And the leadership is ready to cater to the extreme right-wing \nand special interest groups agitating for a fight on judicial \nnominations. They made no secret of the reason for pushing nominations \nto the Senate. They are even willing to hold up confirmation of the new \nDirector of the CIA to vote now instead of a week from now on a \nnomination that has waited 3 years anyway. They just want to stir up a \nfight.\n  Mr. Kavanaugh is a young, relatively inexperienced but ambitious \nperson who, in two hearings, has failed miserably to demonstrate his \ncapacity for independence. I have voted for an awful lot of Republican \nnominees, and I expect I will in the future. I am not going to vote for \nany nominee--Republican or Democrat--who has failed to demonstrate his \ncapacity for independence. This nominee has not, and I cannot in good \nconscious support action on this nomination to one of the Nation's \nhighest courts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, almost 3 years have passed since Brett \nKavanaugh was nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC \nCircuit. I am glad that the time has finally come for an up-or-down \nvote on his nomination.\n\n  Despite the threats of a filibuster and the unwarranted attacks on \nthe nominee's qualifications and character, Brett Kavanaugh will soon \nbe confirmed by a bipartisan majority of this body.\n  I fully support his nomination, and believe that he will be a \nvaluable addition to the Federal bench. In just a moment, I will \noutline the reasons why.\n  But, first, I must say I am troubled that his confirmation has been \nneedlessly protracted and contentious. It is the contentiousness that \nconcerns me most.\n  Brett Kavanaugh's nomination has routinely been described in the \npress as ``controversial''--not because of any legitimate quality or \ncharacteristic of the nominee, but simply because my colleagues on the \nother side have declared it so.\n  These individuals have demeaned Kavanaugh as a ``crony,'' a \n``partisan warrior,'' and have characterized his nomination as ``among \nthe most political in history'' and ``judicial payment for political \nservices rendered.'' Yet, a leading Democrat critic during a recent \nhearing conceded that Brett Kavanaugh has ``blue-chip credentials.'' I \ndon't understand how these comments can be squared with one another.\n  Mr. President, I have deep concerns about the tenor of many recent \ndebates over this President's judicial nominees. I fear that this \nconfirmation battle is just the latest in a series of bad precedents \nset in recent years when it comes to confirmation votes on a \nPresident's nominees.\n\n[[Page S5196]]\n\n  The fight over Justice Samuel Alito's nomination is the first example \nthat comes to people's minds, but there are many others. You will \nrecall that during the Alito debate, one of his opponents said, ``You \nname it, we'll do it,'' to defeat the Alito nomination. Sadly, that \nstatement captured the tone of the Alito confirmation debate--where we \nsaw a distinguished public servant subjected to unwarranted, baseless \nattacks.\n  Fortunately, a bipartisan Senate rejected the attempt to filibuster \nSamuel Alito. Any attempt to filibuster Brett Kavanaugh would surely \nmeet the same fate.\n  I don't think that I am going out on a limb when I say that neither \nthe Alito nor the Kavanaugh confirmation debates could be considered \nthe Senate's ``finest hour.'' Taken together with many others, these \nconfirmation battles have the potential to paint for the public a \ndistorted picture of our Federal judiciary--and further erode the \nconfidence in our legal system.\n  The U.S. Senate should take the lead and give the public a more \naccurate understanding of the judge's role in our constitutional \ndemocracy. To achieve that, the judicial confirmation process must be \nmore civil, respectful, and free of partisan politics.\n  There are many reasons I support this fine nominee.\n  Brett Kavanaugh is, by any reasonable measure, superbly qualified to \njoin the Federal bench. His legal resume is as impressive as they \ncome--one with a demonstrated commitment to public service. After law \nschool at Yale, where he was an editor of the Yale Law Journal, \nKavanaugh held prestigious clerkships for three Federal appellate \njudges--including U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. He also \nserved in the Solicitor General's office, the Office of Independent \nCounsel, and was a partner at Kirkland & Ellis, one of the Nation's \nelite law firms. Most recently, he was Associate White House Counsel, \nand is currently Staff Secretary to President Bush, a job whose title \nbelies the very serious and important responsibilities that that \nindividual performs.\n  Earlier this month, the Judiciary Committee had the good fortune of \nhearing from Kavanaugh's mentors, two men who know him best. Neither of \nthese men recognized the critics' demeaning description of Brett \nKavanaugh as a partisan or as someone with an agenda.\n  Ninth Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski told the Committee that he ``never \nsensed any ideology or agenda'' when Kavanaugh served as his law \nclerk--perhaps the most important job other than the job of the judge \nin judicial chambers. Third Circuit Judge Robert Stapleton urged \nKavanaugh to consider the judiciary as a career because, in addition to \nthis young clerk's legal acumen, he displayed ``no trace of arrogance \nand no agenda.''\n\n  Judge Stapleton praised the nominee for appreciating the ``crucial \nrole of precedent in a society that is committed to the rule of law.''\n  Brett Kavanaugh clearly understands the impartiality and independence \nrequired of an article III judge. At his first hearing in April of \n2004, Mr. Kavanaugh described it best when he said: ``I firmly disagree \nwith the notion that there are Republican judges or Democrat judges. \nThere is only one type of judge. There is an independent judge under \nour Constitution. And the fact they may have been a Republican or a \nDemocrat or an independent in a past life is completely irrelevant to \nhow they conduct themselves as judges.''\n  The independence of our Federal judiciary is, again, using Brett \nKavanaugh's words, ``the crown jewel'' of our constitutional democracy. \nBut I worry that the Senate--perhaps inadvertently--is giving the \nAmerican people a distorted view of our system. I regret that at the \nroot of these harsh and unfair attacks may be a deep-seated cynicism, \nnamely, that Federal judges are somehow just another branch of the \nlegislature, that they are merely politicians in black robes who are \nsomehow able to inject their own policy agendas into court decisions, \nthereby rendering the popular phrase ``legislating from the bench.''\n  But nothing could be further from the Founders' vision of our \njudiciary under the Constitution; Federal judges are given life tenure \nwithout salary reduction, precisely because we want to ensure they will \ndecide each case, big or small, on its own merit according to the law, \naccording to the facts and not with any agenda.\n  Judicial independence requires faithful application of the \nConstitution and the law to each case. I supported Chief Justice John \nRoberts and Justice Sam Alito because I believe they will respect our \nConstitution and respect our laws. And I believe Brett Kavanaugh will \ndo the same.\n  Brett Kavanaugh is a dedicated public servant who will serve this \nNation with distinction as a Federal judge. I urge my colleagues to \nconfirm him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the unanimous consent, the Chair \nrecognizes the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we are considering the nomination of Brett \nKavanaugh to the United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. Why \nare we taking extra time on this nomination? Why are Members coming to \nthe Senate on both sides, some expressing support and others \nopposition? Why is this different from any judicial nomination? There \nare two reasons. This is not your normal Federal court. The United \nStates Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit is the second highest court \nin America. It has been the launching pad for Supreme Court Justices. \nThey consider some of the most complex and technical litigation that \nfaces the Federal bench. It is not just another court.\n  Second, Brett Kavanaugh is not just another judicial nominee. Brett \nKavanaugh comes to this nomination with not the weakest credentials in \nthe history of this bench, but the second weakest credentials.\n  Earlier this month, Senator Kennedy called the Kavanaugh nomination a \ntriumph of cronyism over credentials. Unfortunately, I must agree. The \nnomination of Brett Kavanaugh is a political gift for his loyal service \nto this President and his political party. Mr. Kavanaugh is not being \ngiven an engraved plaque for his fine service; he is being given a \nlifetime appointment to the second highest court in the land. By every \nindication, Brett Kavanaugh will make this judgeship a gift that keeps \non giving to his political patrons who have rewarded him richly with a \nnomination coveted by lawyers all over America.\n  In light of his thin professional record, Mr. Kavanaugh bears a \nparticularly high burden of proof. I have sat through the hearings with \nMr. Kavanaugh. In my estimation, he has not met that burden. He has so \nlittle experience as a practicing lawyer, no experience as a judge. He \nhad a special obligation when it came to these nomination hearings to \ntell us what he believes and what he would do on this important \njudicial assignment. He failed.\n  As I said about the DC Circuit, it is not just any court of appeals. \nIt is the first among equals. It is based in Washington, but its \nrulings affect Americans from coast to coast. It is the court of last \nresort in some cases involving the air that every American breathes, \nthe water that we give our children, the right of labor organizations \nto collectively bargain, whether Americans will have access to \ntelecommunications, and even the price we pay for electricity.\n  The significance of the DC Circuit is seen in the way it has become \nthe farm team for the Supreme Court. Over half of all the Supreme Court \nnominees during the past quarter century were judges on the DC Circuit \nwhere President Bush wants to send his staff secretary, Brett \nKavanaugh. If Mr. Kavanaugh is confirmed for the DC Circuit, it would \nnot surprise me if the Republicans would try to elevate him to the \nhighest court in America.\n  Let's take a look at his experience for this job. Compared to others \nwho have served on this important court, Mr. Kavanaugh's track record \njust does not stand up. He has never had a jury trial in his life. And \nhe has never had a trial before a judge. I don't believe he has ever \ntaken a deposition. I don't know if he has ever filed a motion in \ncourt. There is no evidence that he has any understanding, basic \nunderstanding, of trial practice in civil or criminal courts in \nAmerica.\n\n  Think of that for a moment. Though this man has graduated from \noutstanding schools, he has clerked for important judges, he has never \nhad to roll up his sleeves and represent the client or represent the \nUnited States of America or any State or local jurisdiction at a trial.\n\n[[Page S5197]]\n\n  He has very little experience, of course, on the issues that come \nbefore this court. Nearly half of the cases in the DC Circuit Court \ninvolve Federal agencies dealing with the environment, electricity, \nlabor unions and telecommunications. Mr. Kavanaugh was asked: Now, in \nthis field of expertise that you want to be a judge in, tell us, what \nkind of cases have you handled? What kind of experience do you have? \nWhat did you bring to this? What kind of wisdom as a judge will you \nbring to this? He could identify only one case in his entire life that \nhe had ever been involved in that related to any of those four \nimportant agencies.\n  During the 113-year history of the DC Circuit Court there has only \nbeen one judge, only one in its history, who has been nominated who had \nfewer years of legal experience than Brett Kavanaugh. That judge was a \nman by the name of Ken Starr. No other DC Circuit Court judge in the \npast 113 years has had less experience than Brett Kavanaugh.\n  Is that the best we can do? Is that the best the President and the \nWhite House can do for the people of America? Give us young men who may \nhave great promise, but little experience? People who may be right on \nthe political issues for this White House but have not demonstrated the \nwisdom or life experience that qualify them to stand in judgment on \ncritical issues that affect the lives of every single American?\n  At his second hearing Mr. Kavanaugh tried to assure us that his \ncareer in government service was similar to others who have served in \nthe DC Circuit. He compared his background in government service to a \nformer DC Circuit judge by the name of Abner Mikva, who served with \ndistinction on the DC Circuit Court from 1979 to 1995. It was truly a \nLloyd Bentsen/Dan Quayle moment that Brett Kavanaugh would suggest that \nhe was in Abner Mikva's league. That comparison is such a stretch.\n  Judge Mikva had 28 years of legal experience before he was nominated \nto the DC Circuit. Abner Mikva served for 9 years in Congress, 10 years \nin the Illinois legislature. He had worked for over 12 years in private \npractice. As the late Senator Lloyd Bentsen, who just passed away, \nsaid, to paraphrase, I know Abner Mikva; Abner Mikva is a friend of \nmine, and Brett Kavanaugh is no Abner Mikva.\n  Because of his thin track record as a lawyer, Mr. Kavanaugh had a \nspecial burden of proof to be candid and forthcoming with the \ncommittee, to tell us who he is and what he stands for. He did not meet \nthat burden. Every time he came close to answering a hard question, he \nquickly backed away. But he was well-schooled in the process because he \nspent his time in the White House coaching judicial nominees not to \nanswer questions. Well, he learned as a teacher, and he demonstrated it \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  For example, he would not tell us his views on some of the most \ncontroversial policy decisions of the Bush administration--like the \nissues of torture and warrantless wiretapping. He would not comment. He \nwould not tell us whether he regretted the role he played in supporting \nthe nomination of some judicial nominees who wanted to permit torture \nas part of American foreign policy, who wanted to roll back the clock \non civil rights and who wanted to weaken labor and environmental laws. \nIt would have been so refreshing and reassuring if Brett Kavanaugh \ncould have distanced himself from their extreme views. But a loyal \nWhite House counsel is not going to do that. And that is how he came to \nthis nomination. That is how he addressed the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee with his loyalty to the President.\n  He would not tell us what role he played in the White House's \nunprecedented efforts to give the President virtually unchecked power \nat the expense of congressional oversight.\n  In light of Mr. Kavanaugh's failure to open up to the committee, we \nhave to just guess about his brief career. He coauthored the Ken Starr \nReport; he represented Elian Gonzales; he worked in Florida on the Bush \n2000 recount; he worked with Karl Rove and the Federalist Society to \npick ideological judicial nominees. He has been the go-to lawyer time \nand time again for the far right in American politics. And now he is \nbeing handsomely rewarded for his loyalty, for his service to his \npolitical party.\n  Other than his judicial clerkships, Mr. Kavanaugh has only worked for \ntwo people during his entire legal career: President George Bush and \nKen Starr.\n  Given this background, I asked Mr. Kavanaugh if he would agree to \nrecuse himself in cases involving the Republican Party or the Bush \nadministration. Clearly, he has a conflict of interest, at least the \nappearance of a conflict of interest, from all of the years he spent as \na loyal Republican attorney. I asked him, Would you step away from \ncases that directly impact the Republican Party and the Bush \nadministration policies? He refused.\n  The real question is whether Judge Kavanaugh would be fair and open-\nminded. And there are new concerns that have been raised about Mr. \nKavanaugh's judicial temperament. I saw him at the last hearing with \nhis wife and baby. He looks like a fine father--a beautiful young \nfamily. To all appearances, a good person coming from a good family. \nBut those who have watched him in the courtroom have come to different \nconclusions.\n  Last month the American Bar Association downgraded Mr. Kavanaugh's \nrating after conducting additional interviews with judges and lawyers \nwho had actually seen him in the courtroom and worked with him in the \nlimited exposure he has had to America's courtrooms. A judge who was \ninterviewed by the American Bar Association stated that Mr. Kavanaugh's \noral presentation at the hearing was ``less than adequate'' and that he \nhad been ``sanctimonious.'' That is not a great send-off if a person \nwho is being nominated for a lifetime appointment to the bench, a \nperson who will now stand in judgment not only of other judges but of \nthe counsels and attorneys that appear before him.\n  A lawyer interviewed by the American Bar Association also said: ``Mr. \nKavanaugh did not handle the case well as an advocate and dissembled.'' \nThat doesn't sound very promising for someone seeking a lifetime \nappointment to the second highest court in the land with some of the \nmost technical and difficult arguments and issues to consider.\n  One interviewee called Mr. Kavanaugh ``insulated.'' Another person \nsaid Mr. Kavanaugh is ``immovable and very stubborn and frustrating to \ndeal with on some issues.''\n  Is that what we are looking for in a judge, an insulated person, \nimmovable and stubborn, who dissembles when he is in the courtroom and \nhas a sanctimonious way about him? I can tell you, as a practicing \nlawyer, that is a judge I would avoid, and most people would avoid \nnominating that kind of lawyer to become a judge.\n  The ABA also stated they were disappointed that Mr. Kavanaugh seemed \nto have a ``lack of interest'' in the Manual Miranda ``memogate'' \nscandal and that he failed to conduct an internal White House \ninvestigation as to whether the scandal had tainted the Bush \nadministration's judicial nomination process.\n  This issue is one I know pretty well. I was one of two Senators whose \ncomputers were hacked into by Mr. Manny Miranda, who at the time was a \nRepublican staff member, who worked at various times for the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and for the Senate Republican leadership. Mr. \nMiranda hacked into my computer, my staff computer, and stole hundreds \nif not thousands of legal documents--memoranda that had been prepared \nby my staff analyzing issues, analyzing nominees. Mr. Miranda stole \nthese documents and then turned them over to organizations that were \nsympathetic with his political point of view. There was some question \nas to whether those documents somehow migrated to the White House \ndecision process--legitimate questions because those were times when \nmany of these nominees were very controversial.\n  When Mr. Kavanaugh was asked about these things, he was not that \ninterested--either when the ABA asked the questions or when the \nquestions were asked in the Senate Judiciary Committee. Those questions \nwent to the integrity of the process of naming men and women to our \nFederal judiciary for lifetime appointments. You would believe that Mr. \nKavanaugh, in his capacity as White House Counsel,\n\n[[Page S5198]]\n\nwould have taken that issue much more seriously than he obviously did.\n  This nominee is not the best person for an important job. Michael \nKavanaugh does not deserve a lifetime appointment to the second highest \ncourt in the land.\n  I believe he has a bright future in some other setting. I think after \npracticing law, actually finding out what it means to represent a \nclient, perhaps going into a courtroom someday, maybe sitting down \nbefore a judge, maybe taking a deposition, understanding what it means \nto file a motion in court, and what that means to go to argue for a \nhearing, maybe to prepare a legal brief, to argue a point of view, \nmaybe win a few or lose a few, actually go into a courtroom with a \nclient, pick a jury in a civil case, be a prosecutor in a criminal \ncase, watch as the case unfolds before the judge and the jury, watch it \ngo through to verdict, consider whether or not to launch an appeal--the \nthings I have just described are not extraordinary.\n  This is the ordinary life of practicing attorneys across America. But \nmy life experience, as limited as it was in practicing law, included \nall of these things. They helped me to understand a judge's \nresponsibility--a trial court judge, even an appellate court judge. \nThis is like sending Mr. Kavanaugh into a setting where he has no \nfamiliarity and no experience.\n  You might say: Well, maybe he will learn on the job. Maybe he will \nturn out not only to be a good law student but a heck of a judge. Well, \nit is not a question of trial and error here. It is a question of \nlifetime appointment. We do not get a makeover on this decision. If \nthis Senate approves Brett Kavanaugh for the second highest court in \nthe Federal judiciary in America, he is there for life.\n  Maybe he will learn on the bench. Maybe he will turn out to be \nobjective on the bench. Maybe he will move away from a solid legal \npolitical background to understand the law. Maybe he will have some on-\nthe-job training as a judge in the second highest court in the land. \nBut is that the best we can do? Doesn't that harken back to other \nthings in this administration that have troubled us--people being \nappointed to positions they clearly were not qualified for because they \nwere well connected, they knew the right people? That should not be the \ntest for the Federal judiciary. It certainly should not be the test for \nthe second highest court in the land.\n  I believe the White House, I believe the Republican party, could have \ndone better. There are so many quality judges across America who are \nRepublicans, in my home State of Illinois and in Federal district \ncourts, who could have been nominated for this important and \nprestigious position. Instead, this nominee falls short. It is no \nsurprise to me that the American Bar Association downgraded his \nnomination.\n  I hope if he is approved that in the years to come he will prove me \nwrong. At this point, there is little evidence to base that on. But I \nhope for the sake of this court and for the Federal judiciary that is \nthe case.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hatch). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we are in a kind of a unique procedure this \nevening as we debate three nominees who will be voted on tomorrow \nmorning, obviously, the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh being one of \nthem. But another one that is critical to the United States and \ncritical to the public lands domain of our United States and critical \nto this western Senator and to the western Senator who is presiding at \nthis moment is the nominee for the new position of Secretary of the \nInterior.\n  Tonight, I stand to support the nomination of Governor Dirk \nKempthorne of my State of Idaho, who will be considered and voted on \ntomorrow by the Senate. I was extremely proud that our President would \nrecognize, as Secretary Gale Norton stepped down, that it would be \nright and appropriate to nominate another westerner with the kind of \nexperience westerners uniquely have in the capacity that Governor \nKempthorne has had to serve not only as a U.S. Senator but as a \nGovernor in a very large public lands State.\n  The Department of Interior, of course, is the largest landlord in my \nState, as is true in the State of Utah. It is through that experience, \nand working with the Federal Government and working with the Department \nof Interior, that I believe Dirk Kempthorne, as our new Secretary of \nthe Interior, will do extremely well.\n  When he came before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, on \nwhich I serve, he came with the support, the bipartisan support, of 40 \ncurrent sitting Governors of the States of the United States. I am not \nquite sure I have ever seen that before, that 40 Governors--Democratic \nand Republican--would step up and say, in behalf of one of their \ncolleagues, that he is qualified and they support him without condition \nto become the new Secretary of the Interior. Governor Kempthorne \ndeveloped a close working relationship with these Governors as he \nserved as chairman of the National Governors Association just a few \nyears ago.\n\n  I have watched Governor Kempthorne for two terms, or 8 years in my \nState of Idaho, take very difficult situations and sometimes competing \nsides and bring them together to resolve a problem and to come out \nwhole and smiling in behalf of their interests and in behalf of the \nState of Idaho. It is with that kind of style and capacity that \nGovernor Kempthorne comes to the position of Secretary of the Interior.\n  Dirk Kempthorne has successfully resolved one of the largest tribal \nwater disputes in Idaho history, if not in the West--a tribal dispute \nwe dealt with here on the floor, just a year ago, after he and others \nhad spent well over 5 years working through all the fine and difficult \npoints of negotiation between very opposing and sometimes conflicting \nparties as they dealt with that.\n  When you live in the arid West, as I and the Senator from Utah do, \nyou know how important water is. We find it, obviously, life-\nsustaining. And if it is not managed well, it can create great conflict \nor it can change the whole character of an environment or a State. And \ncertainly for the wildlife of our great States, it is critically \nimportant habitat.\n  Here in the East, we worry about too much water. Out in the arid \nWest, we worry about not enough water. And it is with that kind of \nexperience that the Governor comes to the Secretary's position to \nbecome one of the Nation's largest water landlords, presiding over the \nBureau of Reclamation and all that they do in the Western States and \nacross the Nation in the management of critical water resources and the \ninfrastructure that sustains those resources.\n  As a U.S. Senator, both the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Utah, \nand I served with Governor Kempthorne. He introduced and won passage of \nS. 1, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, critical and necessary as we \nwork on legislation here to make sure we do not impact States and \ncreate and demand certain things from States that are, if you will, \ndemanded but unfunded as a part of a Federal jurisdiction or \nresponsibility. That is the law of the land today, and it certainly \nshowed his skills as a legislator.\n  Under the leadership of Governor Kempthorne, the Western Governors' \nAssociation developed a 10-year strategy to increase the health of \nAmerica's forests. Out of that collaborative process, and working with \nus here, we created the Healthy Forests Act, with the guidance and the \nassistance of the Bush administration, working cooperatively with \npublic land timber State Senators.\n  It was one of the first major pieces of legislation passed to manage \nour forested lands of the Nation in a right and appropriate fashion, to \nrestore health-damaged ecosystems, and to protect and promote the \ncollaborative community effort where community watersheds were involved \nand at risk as a result of fire. So I was pleased to work with the \nGovernor in his capacity at that time as chairman of the Forestry \nSubcommittee here in the Senate, and we were able to successfully bring \nthat to conclusion. That is the law of the land today.\n  Knowing the West, as I said earlier, is critically important to the \nSecretary of the Interior because he is the landlord for much of the \nwestern landscape of our Nation, let alone our crown jewels, our \nnational parks and all that they bring for the citizens of our country.\n  When he was nominated and we had our first visit, he said: Larry, \nwhat\n\n[[Page S5199]]\n\nshould some of our priorities be? And I said: You come at a unique time \nto the Department of Interior. Because there is no question, in my \nmind, at least, this Senator--and in looking at the new energy policy \nwe passed a year ago and all that we have done to get this Nation to \nproducing energy once again--the Governor is the landlord of one of the \nlargest storehouses of energy in this Nation.\n  The kind of drilling for gas in the Overthrust Belt in the West today \nthat we are now reengaging in, with new environmental standards, to \nbring billions of cubic feet of gas on line in the upper Rocky Mountain \nStates, is presided over by the Secretary of the Interior.\n  A debate that has gone on here, somewhat quietly, on the floor of the \nSenate but will take shape in the very near future dealing with the \ndrilling of gas down in the Gulf of Mexico, off the coast of Florida, \nin lease sale 181, once again, dealing with offshore resources, is in \npart if not in whole the responsibility of the Secretary of the \nInterior.\n  The oil shales of Colorado that we are working to develop now--a lot \nof it on our public lands West--is the responsibility of the Bureau of \nLand Management and the Secretary of Interior.\n\n  I believe in the next 2\\1/2\\ years Dirk Kempthorne presides over the \nDepartment of Interior as the second Secretary of the Interior of this \nBush administration, he will, by his presence and the efforts currently \nunderway, actually produce more energy for this Nation and our Nation's \nenergy consumers than will the Secretary of Energy. It is that kind of \nuniqueness and the domain over which he presides that makes this \nposition tremendously important.\n  (Mr. MARTINEZ assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. CRAIG. Lastly, the Governor leaves Idaho with a legacy of growing \nand expanding the Idaho State park system that I know he is very proud \nof, as am I. And now he steps into the role of really being the \ncaretaker of all of our National Park System. That is so phenomenally \nimportant to our country.\n  The parks we have oftentimes called the crown jewels of the great \noutdoors of our country. And they truly are that. Whether it is \nYellowstone in the West or whether it is the Great Smokies south of us \nhere and slightly to the west or whether it is down in the Everglades \nof Florida--of which the Presiding Officer is so proud of that great \npark system--Dirk Kempthorne, as Secretary of Interior, will have a \ntremendous responsibility over that domain.\n  Tomorrow, we will vote on Governor Kempthorne, and he will become the \nnext Secretary of the Interior for the Bush administration and for the \nUnited States of America. My guess is that vote will be a resounding \nvote because when he left here as a Senator, he left in a tremendous \nstate of good will with his colleagues. He has returned as a nominee to \nvisit with, I believe, nearly all of us to assure us that he will be \nhere to listen and to work with us in his role and responsibility as \nour new Secretary of the Interior.\n  So as an Idahoan and as a U.S. Senator, I am tremendously proud that \nour President has nominated and we, tomorrow, will confirm Dirk \nKempthorne as our next Secretary of Interior.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nconfirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to serve on one of the most important \ncourts in our judicial system, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit. Brett Kavanaugh is an extremely bright, \nhard-working, ethical lawyer. I have known him for many years.\n  His father Ed Kavanaugh served as head of a major trade association \nhere in Washington for many years, and he is known by my colleagues in \nCongress as a straight shooter. In this case, the apple did not fall \nfar from the tree. Brett's mother Martha served for many years as a \nState court judge in Montgomery County, MD, and I am sure serves as a \ngreat model of judicial temperament and jurisprudential excellence and \nfairness for her son.\n  Brett Kavanaugh was nominated to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals in \nJuly of 2003. That is almost 3 years since he was nominated. Due in \nlarge part to the delay tactics employed by some earlier this month, \nMr. Kavanaugh was the subject of a highly unusual second hearing on his \nnomination. Interestingly, when he was the nominee for the same court, \nChief Justice Roberts was also subjected to a second hearing before the \nJudiciary Committee. Frankly, it may be the case that in each of these \ntwo circumstances, the second hearing tells us more about the partisan \nnature of the judicial confirmation process than it reveals about the \nqualifications of the nominees.\n  I might add that in both second hearings, both of these people, now \nChief Justice Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh, came off very well, without \none touching by anybody who was trying to do away with them.\n  I hope that the 14-year time period between Chief Justice Roberts' \nfirst nomination and confirmation to the DC Circuit is not matched or \nexceeded by the Kavanaugh nomination. Since he was nominated almost 3 \nyears ago, Mr. Kavanaugh has become a husband and father. Let us pray \nthat he does not become a grandfather before he gets a vote in the \nSenate.\n  This is a good day because not only can we see the light at the end \nof the tunnel, but we can actually get through the tunnel and complete \naction on this nomination that has languished for nearly 3 years. Now \nthat Mr. Kavanaugh has once again answered questions at the unusual \nsecond hearing--and as was the case with his first hearing, some of the \nquestions were not posed to him in the most civil fashion--and now that \nhe has been reported to the floor by the Judiciary Committee, it is my \nhope he will soon have the up-or-down vote he deserves on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  I commend the manner in which Chairman Specter has brought this \nnomination through the Judiciary Committee and on to the floor. In the \nsunshine of the hearing room, it became ever more apparent that there \nare no serious objections to this nomination. Brett Kavanaugh is a \nhighly qualified nominee and a proven public servant. Mr. Kavanaugh's \neducation, employment history, and record of public service should \nspeak for themselves.\n  Brett Kavanaugh is a local guy. He went to high school at Georgetown \nPrep in Bethesda, MD, where he was educated by the Jesuits. From what I \ncan tell, he heard the call of St. Ignatius to be a true man for \nothers. I suspect that many of my colleagues, especially those Jesuit-\neducated Members, appreciate that background.\n  He went to Yale University for college. Having excelled there, he \nwent on to Yale Law School, where he was editor of the ``Law Review.'' \nThat is no small achievement. It shows that he was an excellent \nstudent, one of the best.\n  He went on to not one but two circuit court clerkships. You don't get \nthose clerkships unless you are one of the best. A judge really gets to \nknow his clerks. They work in close quarters together. The judge has a \ntrue opportunity to get the measure of the man. Brett Kavanaugh's \nformer employers, these judges, his mentors, thought so much of Brett \nthat they came to Washington to testify at his confirmation hearing \nearlier this month. That is the second confirmation hearing. They did \nnot mince their words.\n  This is what Judge Walter Stapleton, one of most respected judges in \nthe Third Circuit Court of Appeals, had to say about his former clerk:\n\n       I am confident that Mr. Kavanaugh's perspectives on both \n     life and the law will result in his becoming what I regard as \n     a ``judge's judge.'' His personal confidence is matched by \n     his humility, and his legal acuity by his good, common sense \n     judgment. When he served as my clerk, no case was too small \n     to deserve his rapt attention and, without exception, he \n     initiated his evaluation of a case with no predilections. His \n     ultimate recommendation resulted from a careful case-by-case \n     analysis of the facts and an objective application of the \n     relevant precedents. He is firmly committed to the \n     proposition that there must be equal justice for all and that \n     this can be a reality only if all of our courts faithfully \n     and objectively apply the statutory declarations of Congress \n     and the teachings of the Supreme Court.\n\n  That is what I would call a ringing endorsement, a refutation of \neverything that has been said by the other side--and by a great judge, \nby the way, who knows a lot about judging and knows a lot about \ncharacter.\n  Judge Alex Kozinski on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals had a \nsimilar\n\n[[Page S5200]]\n\nexperience during Mr. Kavanaugh's time with him. This is what he had to \nsay at his hearing:\n\n       I must tell you that in the times that I had Brett clerk \n     for me, I found him to be a positive delight to have in the \n     office. Sure . . . he is really bright, and he is really \n     accomplished, and he is a really excellent lawyer. But most, \n     virtually all, folks who qualify for a clerkship with a \n     circuit judge these days have those qualities.\n        . . . Brett brought something more to the table. He, first \n     of all, brought what I thought was a breadth of mind and a \n     breadth of vision. He didn't look at the case from just one \n     perspective . . .\n       Brett was very good in changing perspective. Sometimes I'd \n     take one position and he'd take the opposite, and sometimes \n     we'd switch places. He was very good and very flexible that \n     way. I never sensed any ideology or any agenda. His job was \n     to serve me and to serve the court, and to serve the people \n     of the United States in achieving the correct result at the \n     court. He always did it with a sense of humor and a sense of \n     gentle self-deprecation.\n\n  These are strong words of support from another great circuit court of \nappeals judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals which is on the far \nwest of this country. And these words describe precisely the type of \nqualities we want in members of the Federal judiciary.\n  Mr. Kavanaugh went on from those clerkships with these great circuit \ncourts of appeal judges to bigger and better things. He worked in the \noffice of the Solicitor General of the United States. There is hardly \nany one in this body who can claim that experience. He clerked for \nSupreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. Only the best and brightest \nlawyers win these types of challenging and prestigious assignments.\n  Mr. Kavanaugh went on to become a partner in one of the greatest law \nfirms in the country, Kirkland & Ellis, a leading national law firm. \nThat doesn't happen to somebody who is as described by some of my \npartisan colleagues on the other side.\n  Brett Kavanaugh left the no doubt financially lucrative practice at \nKirkland & Ellis and returned to public service. He is a public \nservant. For the last 6 years, he has worked at the White House, first \nin the White House Counsel's Office--you don't get there unless you are \nreally good--and currently as staff secretary to the President of the \nUnited States. Pretty impressive stuff. Some people say just a \nsecretary. Come on, this is a person who vets the documents the \nPresident sees. It is a person you trust, whom the President trusts. It \nis a person with wisdom and decency and magnanimity. Nevertheless, some \nopponents of this nomination are suggesting that somehow Mr. Kavanaugh \nis unqualified to serve on the DC circuit. Come on.\n  Let us be clear. Mr. Kavanaugh has been practicing law for 16 years. \nHe has argued civil and criminal matters before trial courts, appeals \ncourts, and even the U.S. Supreme Court. I have heard Senators on this \nfloor criticizing him for not having been a judge, not having been on \nthe court, not having argued all kinds of cases. He has. I don't know \nwhat they have been reading, but they sure as heck haven't been reading \nthe transcript or don't know what is going on here. Very few lawyers \never argue a case before the Supreme Court. Mr. Kavanaugh has done so.\n  The vast majority of his legal practice has been as a public servant. \nI remember a time when public service was applauded and valued, as it \nshould be. My colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, should be \ncommended for reminding young men and women how crucial it is for \ncitizens to transcend their own immediate needs and wants and to serve \nsomething larger than themselves. That is what Brett Kavanaugh has done \nwith his life. Yet instead of applauding him, some attack him. For \nsome, his public service has become a liability. I wish I was kidding, \nbut I am not making this up. You have heard it here tonight. Apparently \nsome believe Mr. Kavanaugh is just too political.\n  His great, alleged sins were to work for the Office of the \nIndependent Counsel in the investigation of the Whitewater matter and \nlater to work for President Bush. Although I think most fair observers \nwould have to say that both of these demanding jobs are professional \nachievements, some are trying unfairly to use political innuendo to tar \nand feather this fine young lawyer. But that dog just won't hunt.\n  As a lawyer in the Office of the Independent Counsel, an office \ncreated by Democrats in the wake of Watergate, he worked on an \ninvestigation initiated by a Democratic President and his Attorney \nGeneral. Nobody has ever suggested that his work was anything but \nprofessional. He was not a political partisan. Yet some people are \nhyperventilating as though the President nominated some partisan hack \nto a lifetime position on the Federal bench. I know Brett Kavanaugh. I \nhave known him for years. I can tell you, he will be neither a partisan \nnor a hack on the bench. He has all the capacities and qualities to \nbecome a great judge.\n  This false charge of partisanship should be recognized for what it \nis--an absolute fabrication. You heard what two Federal judges for whom \nhe clerked had to say about Mr. Kavanaugh. It doesn't get much better \nthan that.\n  Another variation on this attack against Brett is the claim that he \ndoes not have adequate judicial experience. We need to put this in \nperspective. On the DC Circuit, only 4 of the 20 judges confirmed since \nPresident Carter's election served previously as judges. Then, all of a \nsudden, it is a bad thing because Brett Kavanaugh has not had \nexperience as a judge. President Clinton nominated and the Senate \nconfirmed--this is a Democratic President--32 lawyers with no prior \njudicial experience, including Judges David Tatel and Merrick Garland \nto the DC Circuit. Good judges. Are we to believe that those who make \nthese arguments also believe that Chief Justice Earl Warren, Justice \nHugo Black, and even Chief Justice Marshall were somehow lacking \nbecause they had not been involved in politics and had no prior \njudicial experience?\n  I could go on and name a whole bunch of other Supreme Court Justices \nwho never had any prior judicial experience, some of whom are revered \nas the greatest Supreme Court Justices in history. It is very unfair to \nuse that argument, as has been used in countless numbers of cases for \nPresident Bush's nominees and, I might add, President Reagan's as well. \nIt was not that long ago that the minority leader publicly urged the \nPresident to nominate individuals with a diversity of experience rather \nthan just looking to prior judicial service. Well, Brett Kavanaugh fits \nthis bill.\n  His background as staff secretary may prove to be particularly good \njudicial training. In a letter signed by eight individuals who served \nas either counsel or deputy counsel to the President, this is how they \ndescribed that role he fulfilled:\n\n       The importance of this position, as well as its substantive \n     nature, is not always well known or understood outside the \n     White House. As Staff Secretary, Mr. Kavanaugh is responsible \n     for ensuring that all relevant views are consistently and \n     accurately presented to the President. The ability to assess \n     presentations of differing arguments on a wide range of topic \n     areas is a skill that would serve him well on the D.C. \n     Circuit.\n\n  I concur. I ask unanimous consent that the full letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Wiley Rein & Fielding LLP,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 5, 2006.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Specter: We are writing to offer our strong \n     support for the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. We have each \n     served as Counsel or Deputy Counsel to the President, and \n     believe that Mr. Kavanaugh has the qualifications and \n     experience necessary for the D.C. Circuit.\n       As former Counsel and Deputy Counsel to the President, we \n     understand the importance of judicial appointments, \n     particularly those to the federal courts of appeals. In our \n     view, Mr. Kavanaugh possesses all of the requisite \n     qualifications for such an appointment, including outstanding \n     academic credentials, keen intellect, a calm and thoughtful \n     demeanor, and exceptional analytical skills. He has extensive \n     relevant professional experience, including arguments before \n     the Supreme Court of the United States and the federal courts \n     of appeals.\n       We would also like to emphasize the critical nature of the \n     position that Mr. Kavanaugh currently holds as Staff \n     Secretary. The importance of this position, as well as its \n     substantive nature, is not always well known or understood \n     outside the White House. As Staff Secretary, Mr. Kavanaugh is \n     responsible for ensuring that all relevant views are \n     concisely and accurately presented\n\n[[Page S5201]]\n\n     to the President. The ability to assess presentations of \n     differing arguments on a wide range of topic areas is a skill \n     that would serve him well on the D.C. Circuit.\n       Mr. Kavanaugh would be a fair and impartial judge, \n     dedicated to the rule of law. He possesses the highest \n     personal integrity and is exactly the type of individual this \n     country needs on the federal appellate bench. We urge the \n     Senate to act promptly to confirm him to the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Fred F. Fielding,\n         On behalf of: Arthur B. Culvahouse, Jr., Peter J. \n           Wallison, Phillip D. Brady, Richard A. Hauser, Timothy \n           E. Flanigan, David G. Leitch, John P. Schmitz, Jay B. \n           Stephens.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. So with few rounds left, some activist groups opposing \nthis nomination claim that Mr. Kavanaugh is too young and too \ninexperienced. It really is time for these folks to get a grip. Brett \nwas nominated when he was 39 years of age. Today, as a result of \nseveral years--actually 3--of delay and obstruction, he is 41. All \nthree of the judges Brett clerked for were nominated before the age of \n39. Justice Kennedy was 38, sitting on the Supreme Court today. Judges \nKozinski and Stapleton were 35 when they were put on the bench.\n  Several of my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee were elected in \ntheir early thirties. I don't think they would allow others to charge \nthat they were too immature for the work. If James Madison could be the \nprincipal drafter of the Constitution in his midthirties, I think a man \nin his early forties, with 16 years of legal practice, and tough legal \npractice at that, is sufficiently mature to serve on the Federal bench.\n  I believe it is clear that most of the arguments marshaled against \nMr. Kavanaugh are nothing more than a combination of hokum and \ndownright hogwash. So it is not a surprise that the American Bar \nAssociation has repeatedly found him qualified for this position. Let \nme explain what that means.\n  After an extensive review, the American Bar Association gives ratings \nto all of the President's judicial nominees, and the judicial committee \nfactors in these ratings when evaluating judicial nominees. A rating of \nqualified means this from the ABA:\n\n       The nominee meets the committee's very high standards with \n     respect to integrity, professional competence, and judicial \n     temperament, and that the committee believes that the nominee \n     will be able to perform satisfactorily all of the duties and \n     responsibilities required by the high office of a Federal \n     judge.\n\n  What qualified nominee has demonstrated more professional excellence? \nBrett Kavanaugh has been reviewed by the ABA on three separate \noccasions. On each occasion, he has been found qualified to serve in \nthis position. Twice he received a rating of majority well qualified, \nminority qualified. In his most recent rating, he received a rating of \nmajority qualified and minority well qualified. Much has been made of \nthat, some calling it a downgrade. Come on. Over the last 3 years, he \nreceived 42 individual ratings by members of the American Bar \nAssociation, and all, with no exceptions in these 42 ratings, found \nhim--all of them found him qualified for this position.\n  Some will try to make hay out of his most recent rating. Keep your \nfocus on the fact that everybody from the ABA who ever evaluated \nKavanaugh's ability to serve on the Federal bench found him fully \nqualified to do the job. Some of those doing the rating gave him the \nhighest rating of well qualified. Nobody from the ABA ever found him to \nbe not qualified to be a Federal judge. There is good reason for that. \nThey would not dare do that with a person of his ability--although they \ndid in one other case recently.\n  Frankly, I have always been skeptical of the ABA ratings. We have had \nsome great committee ratings and some lousy ones. The lousy ones are \nwhere they allow politics to enter into it. Many Democrats consider the \nratings of the American Bar Association their gold standard. Whenever \nthe Democrats have called something their gold standard, I have found \nit useful to scratch beneath the surface because you will find that it \nis only goldplated. Nevertheless, the Judiciary Committee looks to the \nevaluations of the American Bar Association because these evaluations \ncan often provide useful information.\n  I would like to commend the many men and women of the ABA who \nvolunteer their time and energy to compile these ratings. These are \nvolunteers. In my experience, however, the system is not infallible. \nFor example, Judges Richard Posner and Frank Easterbrook received mixed \nqualified/not qualified ratings when they were nominated by President \nReagan. This was a great and unpleasant surprise to those of us who \nwere confident they would do excellent work on the bench, and many were \nconvinced that those ratings were issued for ideological reasons. \nToday, these two judges are among the most frequently cited members of \nthe Federal judiciary, and their work is widely admired all over the \nlegal profession and all over the Federal courts.\n  Just recently, to show you how bad it can get, Michael Wallace, a \nnominee to the Fifth Circuit, seems to have fallen victim to an \nideological review process by the ABA. He graduated at the top of his \nclass at Harvard and went on to the Virginia Law School, where he \ndistinguished himself. He clerked not only for the Mississippi Supreme \nCourt but also for the late Chief Justice Rehnquist--positions that the \naverage lawyer can only dream about. Yet he was given a unanimously not \nqualified rating. I am very curious about the facts surrounding that \nrating, and I suspect that part of that comes from the fact that he was \nchairman of one of the major legal entities in this country and they \ndidn't like the way he chaired it, even though he is a brilliant man.\n  I also looked at every person on the rating committee for Brett \nKavanaugh, and all rated him qualified, and most rated him well \nqualified, and there were a number who were partisan Democrats. There \nis no question about it, as shown by their schedule of donations. Maybe \nthat had something to do with the downgrading that some on the other \nside have talked about, even though he was found qualified by every one \nof those 42 raters.\n  I understand that some are suggesting that past battles over \nparticular public policy issues might have something to do with \nWallace's rating and also with Kavanaugh's rating. In practice, it is \nsometimes hard to see clearly because the ABA rating system generally \noperates under a principle of anonymity. It is virtually impossible to \nfind out who said what about whom, and try to figure out whether it was \nfair and objective or with an eye toward evening up old scores.\n  While the ABA rating system is murky in some respects, the bottom \nline with respect to the ABA rating of Brett Kavanaugh is that he was \nrated three times and found qualified by everybody who rated him each \ntime--even though some of them on the present committee are very \npartisan.\n  Remarkably, some are trying to distort Mr. Kavanaugh's positive ABA \nrating and recommendation into a negative rating. As Tom Sawyer \nremarked in Huckleberry Finn, you can't pray a lie.\n  This is an important nomination because the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals is such an important court. It reviews many matters relating to \nthe actions of powerful Federal agencies. Many of its decisions will \nnever be reviewed by the Supreme Court.\n  It is important to have judges on the DC Circuit Court, like Brett \nKavanaugh, who understand the proper role of judges and the judiciary. \nFor too long, some Federal judges have been permitted to run roughshod \nover the traditions of the American people.\n  My colleague from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, recently introduced a \nconstitutional amendment that would reestablish the Constitution's \ntraditional meaning on school prayer. In recent years, some Federal \njudges have taken such a radical view of the Constitution's \nestablishment clause--one that is not only at odds with the views of \nthe Founders but with the current views of a majority of Americans in \nnearly every State--that the Constitution's commitment to the free \nexercise of religion is now endangered. The results of this corrupted \nconstitutional interpretation were manifest most prominently in the \ndecision in Santa Fe Independent School v. Doe, where the court \ndetermined that a voluntary student-led prayer before a high school \nfootball game somehow violated the Constitution. A voluntary school \nprayer. We should applaud Senator Byrd for seeking to reestablish the \nConstitution's traditional meaning.\n\n[[Page S5202]]\n\n  The meaning of our constitutional and statutory laws has been twisted \nby some judges on issue after issue. It happened when the Supreme Court \ndiscovered rights to abortion and later to burn the American flag and \ncompletely overturned the statutes of almost every State in the Union--\ncertainly 49 of them. It can happen again today, as liberal activist \ngroups are urging judges to promote same-sex marriage in State and \nFederal courts. That is another illustration.\n  Our judges must show a proper respect for the Constitution. The \nConstitution is not owned by the courts or controlled by judges. No \nless than judges, Members of this body take an oath to support the \nConstitution. The judiciary is a creature of the people and their \nConstitution, and the judiciary should not be a forum for wholesale \nsocial changes initiated by special interest groups and opposed by \nordinary Americans.\n  I have no doubt that Brett Kavanaugh understands that fundamental \ndistinction between judging and lawmaking. Let me read for the record \nwhat was said by Neal Katyal, a Georgetown University Law Center \nprofessor, former attorney to Vice President Gore, and former Clinton \nadministration official. Let me read his expressed strong support for \nMr. Kavanaugh. He says:\n\n       I do not believe it appropriate to write to you unless I \n     feel strongly about a particular nominee. I feel strongly \n     now: Brett Kavanaugh should be confirmed to the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. . . . Mr. Kavanaugh \n     would be a welcome, terrific addition to the United States \n     Court of Appeals.\n\n  He didn't allow his own partisan feelings to be interjected into this \nvery important decision of whom we should support for the court.\n  I am fully supportive of Brett Kavanaugh's nomination. I look forward \nto his long career on the bench. I urge my colleagues to give his \nnomination the support it deserves.\n\n\n                     Nomination of Dirk Kempthorne\n\n  Mr. President, having spoken about Mr. Kavanaugh, I wish to take a \nminute or two to speak about my friend, Dirk Kempthorne, who will be \nvoted upon tomorrow, as I understand it, as well.\n  Dirk Kempthorne served with us in the Senate. I have been here for 30 \nyears, and I have to say that he was one of the finest people with whom \nI have ever served. He was decent, honorable, and hard-working. He was \na person who was honest. This is a man who became a great Governor. He \ndid a great job while he was here. He was only here a short time in the \nSenate, but it was long enough for those of us who knew him to \nestablish in our minds and in our experience the fact that he was and \nis a great human being.\n  He is nominated now for Secretary of the Interior, and I hope \neverybody in this body will vote for him tomorrow. You cannot do \nbetter. The man is honest, decent, honorable, and will work with all of \nus in the Senate, not just Republicans. And he is from the West. He \nunderstands the problems of Federal lands. He understands the problems \nthat confront the West. He understands the problems of energy. He \nunderstands the problems of the environment. He understands the \nproblems of national parks. You can go right down the list.\n  This man has tremendous experience and has been a wonderful Governor \nof Idaho, our neighboring State. He and his wife are two of the best \npeople I know. I hope everybody will vote unanimously in his favor \ntomorrow, or whenever we have that vote.\n\n\n                    Nomination of Michael V. Hayden\n\n  Finally, I thank the leadership for expeditiously scheduling the \nconfirmation vote for General Michael V. Hayden of the U.S. Air Force \nto be Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. In particular, I \nthank Intelligence Committee Chairman Roberts for organizing the open \nand closed hearings last week before our committee. The committee has a \nheavy work schedule, but nothing should be more important than moving \nforward an important nomination like this one.\n  I also recognize the work of my other colleague, Senator Warner, for \nexpediting this nomination through his committee. Air Force GEN Michael \nHayden has spent his life in the service of our great country. I honor \nhis dedication. He has honored us with his dedication.\n  In my opinion, he brought enormous distinction to the uniform he \nwears, and his contributions have served the security of this Nation, \nparticularly since the attacks of 9/11. They have made a profound \ndifference in our ability to defend ourselves in a war unlike any we \nhave been forced to fight.\n  He was before us last year, and he is well known to this body. When \nlast we saw him, he was to become the first deputy of an organization \nformed by the Congress, the Office of the Director of National \nIntelligence. In the legislation that created this office, we tasked it \nand its first officeholders with the enormous job of weaving together \nthe disparate but impressive elements of the American intelligence \ncommunity. Our concept was to create a whole that would be greater than \nthe sum of its parts, but we left the work in the hands of the first \nDirector, Ambassador Negroponte, and his deputy, the man whom the \nPresident now nominated to head the CIA.\n  As a longtime military officer, as one who spent most of his life as \nan intelligence consumer and a distinct part of his life in both the \nhuman and technical practices of intelligence, and now as an architect \nof the new intelligence structure, General Hayden is an individual \nexceptionally prepared to take on the responsibility of transforming \nthe CIA.\n  It is my hope and expectation that, under the leadership of General \nHayden, the talents and capabilities of the CIA not only make the \ndifference in winning this current war on global terrorism but remain \ncentral to facing all of the challenges that loom before us once this \nparticular conflict is won.\n  We have the very real possibility of conflicts with Iran and North \nKorea. We must face the fact that the day may come when we are faced \nwith the threat of armed groups from Latin America.\n  What the CIA does today, if the lessons and experience it gathers \nfrom its contributions are conveyed to its new cadres, will play a key \nrole in managing the conflicts of tomorrow. Let's hope none of these \npotential conflicts become such, and I really don't believe we need to \nallow them to become such.\n  Reform of the intelligence community, in which the CIA has and should \nmaintain a central position, is already well underway, in part due to \nthe creation of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and \nalso due to the oversight by the Senate Intelligence Committee in \ninsisting that the flaws in the intelligence process we have revealed \nbe redressed.\n  The DNI was created to coordinate the elements of the community, as \nwell as to advance a reform agenda for the community as a whole, and in \neach of its elements.\n  Reform, particularly in time of war, is never easy, and it is much \nmore complicated than creating a new bureaucratic structure. It \nrequires creating a new culture that brings a common, professional set \nof doctrines and values to all components of the community that builds \non the extraordinary capabilities that exist, while assembling new \nhybrid excellencies within an entity whose effectiveness must become \ngreater than the sum of its parts.\n  General Hayden comported himself with great probity in his \nconfirmation hearing last week and rendered honest and detailed answers \nto a great range of questions in both the open hearing and in the \nexecutive hearing. The general's lifetime experience has prepared him \nfor taking this post, and I have the highest regard for him.\n  I might add that one of the first decisions that he will have made \nwill be choosing Mr. Kappas to be his Deputy. I have been checking with \nmany leaders in the CIA and elsewhere, and they say Mr. Kappas is an \noutstanding person who can help bring about an esprit de corps that may \nbe lacking.\n  Having said all this, I want to praise Director Goss. I served with \nPorter Goss when he was chairman of the Intelligence Committee in the \nHouse. He is a wonderful man. He did a great job in helping to change \nsome of the mindsets at the CIA. He made a very distinct imprint on the \nCIA for good, and we will miss him as well. But it should not be \nconstrued that General Hayden is replacing him because he didn't do the \njob. Porter said he wasn't going to stay there an excessively long \ntime.\n\n[[Page S5203]]\n\n  I have to say that I believe that as great as Porter Goss is and was, \nGeneral Hayden will be a good replacement. He is one of the best people \nwho has ever served this country. He has spent a lifetime in \nintelligence. He is one of the few people who really understands it \nall, and he is a straight shooter. He tells the truth; he tells it the \nway it is. He is an exceptionally decent, honorable man, and his wife \nis a very honorable and good person as well, as are his children.\n  So I hope all of us will consider voting for General Hayden. He is \nworth it. We should vote for him. We should be unanimous in the \nselection of a CIA Director, but even if we are not, I hope the \noverwhelming number of Senators will vote for this great general, this \ngreat intelligence officer, this great person who we all know is \nhonest, decent, and capable.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have been waiting some time to talk about \nGeneral Hayden. I note the presence of the distinguished chairman of \nour committee, a committee on which I am proud to serve. Given the fact \nwe are starting a discussion of General Hayden to head the Central \nIntelligence Agency, I ask unanimous consent that Chairman Roberts be \nallowed to speak at this time and that I be able to follow the chairman \nafter he has completed his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon for \nallowing me to go first as chairman of the committee. Senator Wyden is \na very valued member of the committee with very strong and independent \nviews but has always contributed in a bipartisan way on behalf of our \nnational security.\n  Good evening, Mr. President. The hour is a little late. Actually, the \nnight is young, but I am not. Nevertheless, I am going to try to be \npertinent on a matter that is of real importance, and that is, in fact, \nthe nomination and hopefully what we expect to be the confirmation of \nGEN Michael V. Hayden to serve as Director of the Central Intelligence \nAgency.\n  As chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence, I rise tonight \nand associate myself with the remarks made by Senator Hatch, who is \nanother very valued member of the committee, in strong support of the \nnomination of General Hayden to be the next Director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency.\n  He is eminently qualified for this position. He is a distinguished \npublic servant, as has been noted, who has given more than 35 years of \nservice to his country.\n  Senator Hatch referred to our hearings both open and closed that we \nheld last week. It was my goal as chairman to ensure that every Senator \nhad enough time to ask any question they wanted or to express any \nconcern they had on their mind in regards to this nomination and the \nqualifications of this man. I think we accomplished that. We gave every \nSenator 20 minutes and then another 20 minutes, and then in a regular \norder, additional time.\n  I might add, Senator Wyden certainly took advantage of that. After \nover 8 hours, the general, the chairman, and other members of the \ncommittee finally concluded.\n  I think it was a good hearing. I think it was a good open hearing and \na good closed hearing. General Hayden certainly distinguished himself, \nand he showed the committee that he will be an outstanding choice for \nCIA Director.\n  General Hayden entered active duty, in terms of background, with the \nU.S. Air Force in 1969 after earning both his bachelor's and master's \ndegree from Duquesne University in his hometown of Pittsburgh.\n  He has had a lengthy and diverse career. He has served as Commander \nof the Air Intelligence Agency and as Director of the Joint Command and \nControl Warfare Center. He has been assigned to senior staff positions \nat the Pentagon, at the headquarters of the U.S. European Command, the \nNational Security Council, and at the U.S. Embassy in the People's \nRepublic of Bulgaria. General Hayden has also served as the Deputy \nChief of Staff for the United Nations Command and U.S. Forces in Korea \nand, more importantly, he has served most recently at the highest \nlevels of the intelligence community. From 1999 to 2005, General Hayden \nwas Director of the National Security Agency.\n  Finally, in April of last year, following intelligence reform and a \ngreat deal of committee action in regards to the Intelligence Committee \nto determine the accuracy of our 2002 NIE, National Intelligence \nEstimate, and then we went through intelligence reform, we had the 9/11 \nCommission, we had the WMD Commission appointed by the President, he \nwas unanimously confirmed by this body to serve in his current position \nas the Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence. He had that \nkind of background, had that kind of expertise, had that kind of \nexperience.\n\n  Given his experience at NSA and the Office of the Director of \nIntelligence, I don't think there is any question General Hayden is \nwell known to the Intelligence Committee. He has briefed us many times. \nI don't know of anybody in any hearing or briefing who has done any \nbetter. It is because of his qualifications and my experience working \nwith him that I support his nomination.\n  This nomination comes before the Senate at a very crucial time. We \nare a nation fighting a war in which the intelligence community is on \nthe front lines. The CIA is an integral and very vital part of the \nintelligence community. We need strong leadership in order to protect \nour national security.\n  When General Hayden takes the helm at the Agency, he is going to find \na number of issues that will demand his attention. These are the same \nissues that we touched on and asked the general to respond to during \nhis confirmation hearings.\n  First, he must continue to improve the Agency's ability to provide \npublic policymakers with high-quality analytic products.\n  The Senate Intelligence Committee's July 2004 report on intelligence \nrelated to Iraq's WMD programs did conclude that the agencies of the \nintelligence community did not explain to policymakers the \nuncertainties behind their Iraq WMD assessments.\n  Analysts must also observe what I refer to as the golden rule of \nintelligence analysis, and we asked this specifically of the general: \nTell me what you know, tell me what you don't know, tell me what you \nthink and, most importantly, make sure that we understand the \ndifference.\n  It will be up to General Hayden to ensure that the CIA analysts \nadhere to this rule in the future.\n  Second, General Hayden must improve the CIA's ability to collect what \nwe call humane intelligence. He can begin by ensuring that the Agency \nis more aggressive in its efforts to penetrate hard targets and in the \nuse of very innovative collection platforms.\n  Third, General Hayden, it seems to me, must improve information \naccess--not information sharing, information access. There is a big \ndifference. We on the Intelligence Committee will look to the general \nto ensure that appropriately cleared analysts community-wide, with a \nneed to know and the proper training have access to the CIA's \nintelligence information in its earliest form, while at the same time \nprotecting sensitive sources and methods.\n  No doubt the general will face a number of significant tasks, but \nbased on his record as a manager, his qualifications, and his \ndemonstrated leadership, I believe he is the right choice to lead the \nCIA. The Senate should expeditiously confirm him and let him get to \nwork over at Langley.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support the nominee, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am next in line, but I understand the \nmajority leader and the distinguished Senator from Nevada wish to have \na brief colloquy. I will defer to them and pick up when they are \nfinished.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that during this \nevening's session, it be in order for Senators to speak in executive \nsession on the Kavanaugh nomination No. 632, or the Hayden nomination \nNo. 672; provided further, that following disposition of the Kavanaugh \nnomination, the\n\n[[Page S5204]]\n\nSenate proceed to a vote on the Hayden nomination No. 672; further, if \nNo. 672 is confirmed, then the Senate immediately proceed to a vote on \nthe confirmation of Calendar No. 693; I further ask unanimous consent \nthat following those votes, Senator Nelson of Florida be recognized to \nspeak up to 5 minutes, and the Senate then proceed to a cloture vote \nwith respect to Executive Calendar No. 630, Dirk Kempthorne to be \nSecretary of the Interior; provided further, that if cloture is \ninvoked, Senator Landrieu be recognized for up to 10 minutes, and the \nSenate then proceed to an immediate vote on the confirmation of the \nnomination of Dirk Kempthorne.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, what all this means is that by this \nagreement, we will allow Senators to speak tonight on either the \nKavanaugh nomination or the Hayden nomination. We will convene tomorrow \nmorning at 8:45. It is our hope that we will be able to vote on the \nconfirmation of the Kavanaugh nomination after convening. We will then \nproceed to the votes on the Hayden nomination and the cloture vote on \nthe Kempthorne nomination. Senators, therefore, can expect three early \nrollcall votes during Friday's session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before he leaves the Chamber, I simply wish \nto say to the distinguished chairman of our committee that I thank him \nfor his kind and gracious introductory remarks to me. As he knows, \nsometimes we agree, as we did in the effort to make public the CIA \ninspector general's report on 9/11. I appreciated working with the \ndistinguished chairman on that matter. Sometimes we disagree, as we do \ntonight with respect to the nomination of General Hayden, but Chairman \nRoberts has always been courteous and fair in our committee and \nessentially to every member. I thank him for that as he leaves the \nChamber tonight. Clearly, Chairman Roberts and Senator Hatch, two \ndistinguished members of our Intelligence Committee, want no part of \nit, but there are those who want to turn the Hayden nomination into a \nreferendum on who is toughest on terrorism, Republicans or Democrats. \nThese people do America a disservice. I know of no Senator who \nsympathizes with a terrorist. I know of no Senator who wishes to coddle \nal-Qaida. I know of no Senator who is anything other than a patriot.\n\n  Unfortunately, this nomination is being used to divide the Senate and \nthe American people on the issue of terrorism. Just this past Monday, \nthe Washington Post newspaper reported that the White House:\n\n       Seems eager for a battle over the nomination of Air Force \n     GEN Michael V. Hayden as CIA Director.\n\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       The White House hopes voters will see the warrantless \n     surveillance program Hayden started as head of the National \n     Security Agency as tough on terrorism rather than a violation \n     of civil liberties.\n\n  I believe the American people deserve better than the White House \nagenda of false choices. I believe one can fight the terrorists \nferociously and protect the liberties of law-abiding Americans. I \nbelieve the Senate should not be bullied into thinking that security \nand liberty are mutually exclusive, and I believe that millions of \nAmericans share that view. From the days of Ben Franklin, security and \nliberty in America have been mutually reinforcing, and it is our job to \nmaintain this sacred balance.\n  This is harder to do now because across America there is less trust \nand there is more fear. The lack of trust has been fed by the Bush \nadministration telling the public that they have struck the right \nbalance between security and liberty, but then we have had one media \nreport after another that contradicts that claim.\n  When the media reports come out, the administration says it can't say \nanything because responding would help the terrorists, but then the \nadministration responds in multiple forums to get out the small shards \nof information that they believe is helpful to their point of view.\n  The increased fear among our people is nourished by the fact that \nthere are no independent checks on the Government's conduct, as there \nhave been for more than 200 years in America. Law-abiding Americans \nhave no reason to be confident that anyone is independently verifying \nreports about the administration's reported surveillance of their \npersonal phone calls, e-mails, and Internet use.\n  All of this mistrust and fear has translated into a lack of \ncredibility. The administration has given us, by words and deeds, a \nnational security routine: Do one thing, say another.\n  An absolute prerequisite to running intelligence programs \nsuccessfully is credibility. Despite the scores of talented, dedicated, \npatriotic people working at Langley today, the failings of the Agency's \nrecent leadership have left the Agency's credibility diminished.\n  The Agency is now looking at the prospect of its fourth Director \nsince \n9/11. The last Director brought partisanship and lost talented \nprofessional staff as a result. The Agency's No. 3 man, who resigned \nthis month, is being investigated by the FBI for links to the bribing \nof a former Congressman. It is long past time to get it right at the \nCIA.\n  This will be the second time I have voted on a Hayden nomination. The \nfirst time around, when he was nominated to serve as Deputy National \nIntelligence Director, I voted for the General. In my view, General \nHayden's technical knowledge is not in question. He has always been \npersonable in any discussions the two of us have had, and he has always \nbeen extremely easy to talk to.\n  But since I last voted for him, information has come to light that \nhas raised serious questions about whether the General is the right \nperson to lead the CIA. There are serious questions about whether the \nGeneral will continue to be an administration cheerleader; serious \nquestions regarding his credibility; serious questions about his \nunderstanding of and respect for constitutional checks and balances, \nand the important accountability in Government that they create.\n  Here are the facts: Last December, the New York Times reported that \nsince 9/11, the National Security Agency, which General Hayden was in \ncharge of at the time, initiated a warrantless wiretapping program. \nGeneral Hayden, reported once more in the media to be the architect of \nthe program, became the main public spokesperson in its defense. At a \nWhite House press conference in December of 2005 and at subsequent \nevents, including a speech at the National Press Club this past \nJanuary, the General vigorously defended the administration's \nwarrantless wiretapping program.\n  Even before the war in Iraq, I was concerned about politicizing \nintelligence. Since then, I think they are only additional grounds for \nconcern.\n  At his confirmation hearing, General Hayden said he wants to get the \nCIA out of the news. To me, this was a curious statement, given all the \ntime he has spent on the bully pulpit defending the President's \nwarrantless wiretapping program. Inevitably, any political appointee \nwill have an allegiance to the White House that appointed him or her. \nBut when it comes to positions in the intelligence community, I believe \nthat this allegiance, regardless of whether a Republican or a Democrat \nis in the White House, should go only so far.\n  It is not good for our great country to have a CIA Director who jumps \ninto every political debate that comes up here in Washington, D.C. It \nis not good for our great country to have a CIA Director who willingly \nserves as an administration cheerleader. It is not good for our great \ncountry to have a CIA Director who gets trotted out again and again and \nagain to publicly argue for the President's controversial decisions. \nPoliticizing the position renders the CIA Director less effective and \nless credible.\n  Inevitably, Americans will begin to see the Director as an \nadministration defender rather than a conveyor of the unvarnished \ntruth. And in our next CIA Director, we need more truth and we need \nless varnish.\n  My second concern rises out of the first. Not only has General Hayden \nraised questions through his words and actions about politicizing \nintelligence, but, unfortunately, even when he says something, you \ncannot trust, based on his words, that what he says is credible.\n\n[[Page S5205]]\n\n  At the National Press Club speech he gave in January defending the \nNSA warrantless wiretapping program, the General repeatedly stated that \nthe program was limited to international to domestic, or domestic to \ninternational calls. For instance, he said:\n\n       There is always a balancing between security and liberty. \n     We understand that this is a more--I'll use the word \n     ``aggressive''--program than would be traditionally available \n     under FISA. It is also less intrusive. It deals only with \n     international calls.\n\n  Later, General Hayden said:\n\n       That is why I mentioned earlier that the program is less \n     intrusive. It deals only with international calls.\n\n  He explained:\n\n       The intrusion into privacy--the intrusion into privacy is \n     significantly less. It is only international calls.\n\n  He added:\n\n       We are talking about here communications we have every \n     reason to believe are al-Qaida communications, one end of \n     which is in the United States.\n\n  At the conclusion of the Press Club address, he was asked by a \nreporter:\n\n       Can you assure us that all of these intercepts had an \n     international component, and that at no time were any of the \n     intercepts purely domestic?\n\n  The General said:\n\n       The authorization given to NSA by the President requires \n     that one end of the communications has to be outside the \n     United States. I can assure you by the physics of the \n     intercept, by how we actually conduct our activities, that \n     one end of these communications are always outside the United \n     States of America.\n\n  With those final words, the speech and the press conference \nconcluded.\n  But then, just weeks ago, Americans read in the USA Today newspaper \nthat the NSA, according to the paper, was also gathering basic \ninformation concerning hundreds of millions of innocent Americans' \ndomestic phone calls. I cannot confirm or deny what was in that \narticle, but I can tell you when I opened the paper that morning and \nread the article, it raised serious concerns for me about whether the \nGeneral had been misleading.\n  Unfortunately, this is not a single incident in an otherwise perfect \nrecord. There is a pattern of saying one thing and doing another when \nit comes to the General. For instance, General Hayden said he received \nlegal authority to tap Americans' phone calls without a warrant in \n2001. A year later, in 2002, the General testified before Congress's \njoint 9/11 inquiry that he had no authority to listen to Americans' \nphone calls in the United States without first obtaining enough \nevidence for a warrant. As conceded by the General himself, at the time \nhe made these statements to Congress, the NSA was in fact doing the \nvery thing he led us to believe it could not: engaging in warrantless \nwiretapping on persons here in our country.\n  When I asked the General to explain these contradictions at his \nconfirmation hearing, I didn't get much of a response. At best, I got a \nnonanswer that reflected the General's skill in verbal gymnastics, but \nnot the type of candor that America needs in its next CIA Director.\n  There is another example that I want to talk briefly about, Mr. \nPresident. When General Hayden came before the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee last year in conjunction with his nomination to serve as a \ndeputy to Ambassador Negroponte, I asked him about the NSA Trailblazer \nProgram. This had been one of the General's signature NSA management \ninitiatives, one that had been again reported as one designed to \nmodernize the Agency's information technology infrastructure. In \nresponse to my questions--I want to be specific about this because \nthere has been a lot of discussion about it--among a variety of other \ncomments the General made about the Trailblazer Program, at page 44 of \nthe transcript of that 2005 hearing that was held to approve General \nHayden to be the deputy to Mr. Negroponte, the General said with \nrespect to the Trailblazer Program:\n\n       A personal view, now--looking back--we overachieved.\n\n  Now, I cannot go into detail here on the Senate floor because of the \nclassified nature of the information involved, but suffice it to say \ntoday the press is reporting that the program is belly-up and the press \nis reporting that it is a billion dollars worth of junk software.\n  I take my constitutional responsibility to give advice and consent to \nthe President's nominations very seriously. Last Monday, after the \nhearing, I did something that I do not customarily do. I reached out to \nthe general once more in an effort to try to find grounds for \nsupporting his nomination. In my office I asked that he keep the Senate \nIntelligence Committee fully and currently informed of all intelligence \nactivities other than covert actions.\n\n  In writing, the general responded:\n\n       Regarding communications with Congress on critical issues, \n     if confirmed as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency I \n     intend to have an open and complete dialog with the full \n     membership of the committee, as indicated by 501(C) 502 and \n     503 of the National Security Act as amended.\n\n  So far, so good. But then the general added:\n\n       As you understand, there will continue to be very sensitive \n     intelligence activities and operations such as covert actions \n     that, consistent with legislative history and longstanding \n     practice, is briefed only to leadership of the committee. On \n     those rare occasions, communications with those Members will \n     be exhaustive.\n\n  So once again the bottom line, General Hayden's response is \nambiguous. If confirmed he intends to sometimes inform Congress and at \nother times only inform certain Members, without explaining how this \nwill be decided or what his role in the decision will be.\n  Read his response from Monday and you still can't determine when he \nwill brief members of the Senate Intelligence Committee on the \nactivities of the CIA, and when they will be learning about them by \nreading the morning newspaper.\n  As I stated, the CIA is looking at the prospect of its fourth \nDirector in this dangerous post-9/11 world. Serious reform is needed to \nget the Central Intelligence Agency headed in the right direction. To \nmake this happen, America needs a CIA Director who says what he means \nand means what he says. Unfortunately, time and time again, General \nHayden has demonstrated a propensity for neither. His words and acts on \none occasion cannot be reconciled with words and acts on another. He is \na man with a reputation for taking complicated questions and giving \nsimple answers.\n  Unfortunately and repeatedly, when I have asked him simple questions, \nhe has given me complicated answers, or nothing at all.\n  Americans want to believe that their Government is doing everything \nit can to fight terrorism ferociously and to protect the legal rights \nand civil liberties of law-abiding Americans. But right now millions of \nAmericans are having trouble locating the checks and balances on \nExecutive power. They don't know what the truth is and they are very \nconcerned about what is next.\n  I believe it is time for the Senate to break that cycle. I remain \nconcerned that what has happened at the National Security Agency under \nGeneral Hayden will be replicated at the Central Intelligence Agency. \nFor that reason, I oppose the nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me commend my colleague from the State \nof Oregon, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, a committee \non which I served for 4 years. Senator Wyden's statement is consistent \nwith his service on that committee. It shows that he takes that \nassignment very seriously, he does his homework on a very challenging \ncommittee assignment, and that he has given great thought and \nreflection to this important decision about whether General Hayden \nshould be named to head the CIA.\n  Senator Wyden and I have discussed this nomination. There are some \nthings he cannot share with me because they were learned behind closed \ndoors in the Senate Intelligence Committee, but I have become \nconvinced, as well, that General Hayden, despite his many great \nattributes and good qualifications, is not the right person for this \nappointment.\n  When we reflect on America since \n9/11, there are many things that are very clear. First, this country \nwas stricken in a way that it has never been stricken since the War of \n1812, when the British invaded the United States, invaded this Capitol \nbuilding, sacked and burned it. We found 3,000 in-\n\n[[Page S5206]]\n\nnocent Americans destroyed on American soil--a gut-wrenching experience \nthat we will never forget. It changed America and it called on the \nPresident, on the leadership in Congress, to summon the courage to \nrespond.\n  In the days that followed that horrible event, there were some \ninspiring images. We can recall the videotape of firefighters ascending \nthe stairway into the World Trade Center, to certain death, braving \nwhat they knew was a terrible disaster to try to save innocent lives.\n  We can recall the President of the United States going to the rubble \nof the World Trade Center in New York and in a few brief moments \nrallying America and the world behind our cause.\n  We can remember Members of Congress standing just a few feet away \nfrom this Senate Chamber, Members of Congress who hours before had been \nlocked in partisan combat, who put it all aside after 9/11, sang ``God \nBless America,'' and said: What can we do to save America?\n  After that, the response around the world; this great, giant, the \nUnited States of America, having suffered this terrible loss, was able \nto count its friends and allies very quickly. So many nations stepped \nforward and said: We are with you. We will help you. We understand that \nyou must bury your dead and grieve your losses, but then you must \ndefend yourself and your Nation for its future, and we will be there.\n  It was an amazing outpouring of support for our great country. It was \na wonderful, encouraging moment.\n  The President came to this Congress and gave a speech shortly after \n9/11 that I will say was one of the best I had ever heard, summoning us \nto gather together as a nation to defend ourselves against this threat \nof terrorism. Then, of course, we considered the PATRIOT Act. We \nchanged the laws of America so our Government would have new tools to \npursue the terrorists. It passed with an overwhelming bipartisan vote, \nvery quickly, and we started to roll up our sleeves and take on this \ntask.\n  At the time I was a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. I \nrealized then more than ever how important that committee was. \nIntelligence is the first line of defense, and good intelligence used \nwisely can protect America from terrorism and from enemies who would \ninflict great casualties and pain on us.\n\n  Then, a few months later, came a new challenge, a challenge we had \nnot anticipated on 9/11. The President and this administration told us \nthat the real battle was against Saddam Hussein in Iraq. I remember \nsitting in that Senate Intelligence Committee just days before the vote \non the Senate floor about the invasion of Iraq and turning to a staffer \nwho said to me: Senator, something is unusual here. This is the first \ntime we have ever considered any kind of effort of this magnitude \nwithout asking the intelligence agencies of the United States to tell \nus what they know so we can gather information from every source and \nmake a conscious and sensible judgment about what we should do. It is \ncalled a National Intelligence Estimate, an NIE.\n  So at my staffer's prompting, I requested a National Intelligence \nEstimate, as did Senator Graham of Florida. It turned out it was \nroutine to produce them, but no one had taken the time to do that \nbefore the invasion of Iraq.\n  In very short order, just a few weeks, a National Intelligence \nEstimate was submitted to the Intelligence Committee. There were claims \nin that NIE that turned out to be false, but at the time we didn't know \nit. There were claims about weapons of mass destruction that threatened \nthe safety of the United States of America. There were claims of \ncapacities and capabilities by Saddam Hussein in Iraq that were greatly \nexaggerated. There were claims that Saddam Hussein and the Iraqis were \nproducing nuclear weapons which could be used against the United \nStates. Leaders in the White House were telling us they were fearful of \nmushroom clouds that could result in a nuclear holocaust. All of this \nwas given to the American people and the Intelligence Committee.\n  The sad reality was when we sat in the Intelligence Committee behind \nclosed doors, we knew that the American people were not getting the \nfull story, that in fact even within this administration there was a \ndispute as to the truth of these statements, statements given every day \nand every night by the leaders of this administration.\n  We know what happened. We invaded Iraq. Saddam Hussein, in a matter \nof weeks, was gone as their dictator, and we came to learn that all of \nthe claims about weapons of mass destruction were false, totally false. \nThe American people had been misled.\n  There is nothing worse in a democracy than to mislead the people into \nwar, and that is what happened. We learned, as well, that there were no \nnuclear weapons. All those who claim there was a connection between 9/\n11 and Saddam Hussein could find no evidence. The statements made by \nthe President in his State of the Union Address that somehow or another \nSaddam Hussein was obtaining yellowcake or the makings of nuclear \nweapons from Africa turned out to be false, and the President had to \nconcede that point.\n  Then, in light of it, we decided it was time to take a look. The \nIntelligence Committee on which I served decided to ask two questions: \nFirst, did our intelligence agencies fail us? Did they come up with bad \ninformation when they should have given us good information and good \nadvice? Were we, in fact, misled into this war by that information? And \nsecond: Did any member of this administration misuse that intelligence \ninformation, use it in a fashion that did mislead or deceive the \nAmerican people? Those were two specific assignments accepted by the \nSenate Intelligence Committee. I served on the committee while we were \nin the process of meeting that obligation. We came to learn the first \nassignment was exactly right. The Senate Intelligence Committee \nconcluded, as did the House, that our intelligence agencies had failed \nus. Our first line of defense had failed us, giving us information that \nwas totally flawed, information which was not reliable, information \nwhich never should have resulted in the invasion of Iraq.\n  The administration had argued that we have a new foreign policy, a \npreemptive foreign policy. We can't wait to be attacked, the President \nsaid, we have to attack first if there is a threat. It turns out the \ninformation used to measure that threat was wrong, in the invasion of \nIraq.\n  Mr. President, 23 of us in the Senate voted against the use of force \nin Iraq, 22 Democrats and 1 Republican. We believed then, most of us, \nthat the information being given to the American people was misleading, \nthe intelligence information was not accurate.\n  It turns out that our estimate was true. It turns out that our \ninvasion of Iraq was based on false pretenses and on intelligence \ninformation that was fatally flawed.\n  The second investigation to be undertaken by the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, promised more than 2 years ago, was that we would look into \nthe misuse of this intelligence by members of this administration. That \nis a tough thing to ask a Senate Intelligence Committee, led by a \nRepublican chairman, to do, because it is likely to bring some \nembarrassment to the administration of the President.\n  Unfortunately, as I stand here today, the promise of almost 2 years \nago to complete this second phase has not been completed. We still \ndon't know if members of this administration misused the intelligence.\n  But there are things that we do know, things that are very clear. It \nis clear that in the lead-up to the invasion of Iraq and afterwards \nthere was a separate intelligence agency created in the Department of \nDefense by a man named Douglas Feith that became virtually a renegade, \nindependent operation. It was not working in concert with other \nagencies of our Government gathering intelligence. That is inconsistent \nwith what we hoped to be a coordinated intelligence effort in our \nGovernment. But Secretary Rumsfeld, who enjoyed the confidence of the \nPresident, was able to initiate this intelligence operation in defiance \nof many other intelligence agencies. We know that for a fact.\n  Then we came to learn several other things. We learned that after 9/\n11, the Bush administration, for the first time in modern history, \ndecided that they needed to rewrite the standards of interrogation for \ndetainees. For decades we had held to the standard of the Geneva code, \nwhich basically said that we\n\n[[Page S5207]]\n\nwould not engage in torture, cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. \nBut the infamous Bybee memo, exchanged at the time with Alberto \nGonzales, then-White House Counsel, and many others, was at least a \nsuggestion that we could breach those rules and change those rules. \nThat conversation, in closed sections of the White House, took place \nwithout the knowledge of the American people. But then the terrible \ndisclosure at Abu Ghraib torture, inhuman treatment perpetrated, sadly, \nby those who were in the service of the United States.\n\n  It was clear then that the issue of torture was one that was front \nand center for us as a Nation to face during this time of terror. So \nwith this torture issue before us, we also had other things to \nconsider.\n  Not long thereafter came the news that this administration was \nengaging in activities which clearly were beyond the law--the so-called \nwarrantless wiretaps of Americans. You see, under the laws of the \nUnited States and under our Constitution, one cannot invade through a \nwiretap the privacy of another without court approval. No executive \nbranch office, Department of Justice, or FBI can engage in a wiretap \nwithout the approval of a court order or, when it comes to questions of \ninternational security, foreign intelligence gathering, through the \nFISA court, a special court created for that purpose. Those are the two \noptions.\n  But this administration said that it was above the law; that it \ndidn't have to answer to those courts; that it didn't have to work \nthrough those courts; it could engage in warrantless wiretaps through \nthe National Security Agency, an agency administered by General Hayden.\n  Several weeks ago, USA Today disclosed more information indicating an \ninvasion of privacy where the telephone records of innocent American \npeople are being gathered by the same agency, the National Security \nAgency, in an effort I cannot describe in detail because I have not \nbeen briefed, but in an effort to find some intelligence information.\n  Now comes the nomination of General Hayden to become Director of the \nCentral Intelligence Agency after all of this experience.\n  Let me say at the outset that I respect General Hayden. He is a man \nwho has served his country with distinction for over three decades. \nMany say--and I cannot disagree--that he is one of brightest minds when \nit comes to intelligence, and the agencies that he has worked with in \nthe past are clear evidence of that.\n  I honor and appreciate his service. I know he is a man of \nconsiderable knowledge and formidable intellect. He is well versed in \nthe questions of intelligence, particularly in the most technical \nareas. However, I have three primary reservations about this \nnomination.\n  First, I am concerned about the role of General Hayden in the NSA's \nwarrantless wiretapping of American citizens.\n  Second, I am concerned about how the CIA will treat detainees in \ntheir custody and how they will implement the clear prohibition on \ntorture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment standard that was \npassed last year in the McCain amendment, which I cosponsored, by a \nvote of 90-9 on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  I am also concerned about the issue of the General's independence, \nnot merely his independence as an individual but his ability to stand \nup to the Department of Defense and the likes of Secretary Rumsfeld, \nand separate defense intelligence operations under Douglas Feith. I \nraised these concerns when I met with General Hayden, and they we were \nechoed by many members of the committee during the hearings.\n  First, I would like to address the issue of surveillance of American \ncitizens.\n  As Director of the NSA, General Hayden presided over a program that \ncarried out warrantless wiretaps on innocent Americans. Those wiretaps \ndid not have judicial approval, nor did they have meaningful \ncongressional oversight. Precious few Members of Congress were briefed \nabout the wiretaps, and they were sworn to secrecy about this \nprocedure.\n  General Hayden has stated that the Attorney General and other legal \nauthorities within the administration had concluded that such actions \nwere proper and legal. In fact, I have seen no evidence of that \nwhatsoever.\n  We created the FISA court to issue warrants for such surveillance. If \nthe administration believes the FISA court is not sufficient in this \nage of terrorism and high technology, the administration should come to \nCongress and ask us to change the laws, as we did with the PATRIOT Act.\n  In addition to warrantless wiretaps, General Hayden reportedly \noversaw a program that assembled an enormous database, the largest in \nthe history of the world, of literally millions of calls made by \nAmericans to Americans in the United States. Tens of millions of \nAmericans appeared to have been included in this database. And most of \nus in Congress learned about it on the front page of USA Today.\n  I am disturbed about the role that General Hayden played in \noverseeing these practices. It is certainly critical that the Director \nof the CIA protect our security but also not endanger our liberties.\n  Second, I am concerned about the way the CIA will treat detainees. \nWhen the McCain amendment was pending, it was opposed openly by Vice \nPresident Richard Cheney who said that he believed intelligence \nagents--those working for the CIA--should not be bound by the \nprovisions of the McCain amendment. We disagreed. We passed, on the \nfloor of the Senate, as I said earlier, by a vote of 90-9, clear \nstandards barring torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. I \nbelieve that we should never engage in that treatment--and that is what \nthe McCain amendment requires. Senator McCain said it well last year, \nand I quote him. He said, ``It's not about who they are. It's about who \nwe are.''\n  I believe we should have one clear, uniform interrogation standard \nthat applies to all United States personnel--those in uniform and those \nin a civilian capacity.\n  I was disturbed when General Hayden was meeting with me and did not \nappear to share that view. He was evasive. While he said that we must \nestablish clear guidelines, he indicated he might prefer to have one \nstandard for the military and another standard for intelligence \npersonnel. He said he wanted to study the question, but that two sets \nof rules might be appropriate.\n  I disagree. There is only one standard. It should be clear and \nunequivocal.\n  Finally, there is the question of independence. The Pentagon controls \nan estimated 80 percent of the intelligence budget. That fact alone \nmakes it critical for the CIA to vigorously defend its independence \nover the Department of Defense. We need an independent voice at the \nCIA.\n  I note that last year's intelligence authorization bill, as passed by \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee, stated that the Director of the CIA \nshould be appointed from ``civilian life.''\n  That bill in the end never reached the floor of the Senate for a \nvote, but we should nevertheless consider that recommendation \nseriously.\n  General Hayden assured me that he stood up to Secretary Rumsfeld in \nthe FISA operation when he disagreed with him, and that he will \ncontinue to do so.\n  Colleagues on the Intelligence and Armed Services Committee, whom I \ndeeply respect, including Senator Levin of Michigan, have concluded \nthat General Hayden will assert that independence and stand up to the \nPentagon. I certainly hope he does.\n  Within the Bush administration, the question of the independence of \nintelligence agencies is particularly important. That is because the \nintelligence process has been abused.\n  This administration clearly politicized and distorted the use of \nintelligence to promote the false premise that Saddam Hussein was tied \nto the 9/11 attacks and that Iraq was developing weapons of mass \ndestruction, including nuclear weapons. We know now that was false.\n  In 2002, the administration undermined the independence and \ncredibility of the intelligence process by creating the Office of \nSpecial Plans at the Pentagon under the leadership of Under Secretary \nof Defense Douglas Feith. Several of us addressed this issue as part of \nthe Intelligence Committee's 2004 Report on the Prewar Intelligence \nAssessments on Iraq. And Senator Levin joined me in this.\n  We wrote:\n\n\n[[Page S5208]]\n\n\n       The Intelligence Community's findings did not support the \n     link between Iraq and the 9/11 plot [that] administration \n     policy officials wanted [in order] to help galvanize support \n     for military action in Iraq. As a result, officials under the \n     direction of Under Secretary Feith took upon themselves to \n     push for a change in the intelligence analysis so that it \n     bolstered administration policy statements and goals.\n\n  I asked General Hayden about Douglas Feith and the Office of Special \nPlans. To his credit, he was critical of that operation. He said it was \nnot legitimate ``alternative analysis,'' and he described the troubling \npattern in which preconceptions shaped the search for intelligence.\n  General Hayden reiterated his discomfort with the Feith approach in \ntestifying before the Intelligence Committee. I hope that when he is \nconfirmed, as I am certain he will be, that General Hayden will go even \nfurther in opposing efforts to subvert the intelligence process.\n  Today, we face even graver dangers than we did in 2003 when Under \nSecretary Feith was operating his own intelligence shop.\n  The war in Iraq has claimed over 2,400 American lives, and there is \nno end in sight.\n  Iran has pursued three different methods of enriching uranium and has \nexperimented with separating plutonium, moving closer to the possible \ndevelopment of nuclear weapons.\n  Osama bin Laden is still at large; al-Qaida has splintered in \ndifferent and dangerous directions, and North Korea is expanding its \nnuclear arsenal.\n  All these issues make it extremely important that our intelligence \ncommunity conduct independent, accurate, trustworthy analysis. And it \nis critical that we operate within the bounds of our own Constitution \nand our laws.\n  We should not have one standard for the military and another for the \nintelligence community, a position once argued as high in this \nadministration as Vice President Cheney. We should not engage in \ntorture or hold detainees indefinitely without of charging them with a \ncrime.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, the President of the United States said it would \nsoon be time to close Guantanamo. That certainly is something that many \nof us believe is in order. Those who are dangerous to the United States \nshould be charged and imprisoned. Those who have no value to us from an \nintelligence viewpoint should be released, if they are not a danger to \nthe United States.\n  We cannot ignore the fundamental privacy rights of American citizens \nand the moral values and rights reflected in the treatment of those \ndetainees.\n  General Hayden will be taking charge of the CIA, by many reports at a \ntime when the Agency is demoralized. He will have to oversee critical \nreforms.\n  Last December, members of the 9/11 Commission handed out report cards \non reform for the Bush administration. They gave the CIA an \n``incomplete'' in terms of adapting to its new mission.\n  I hope General Hayden can change that. I hope that he will be the \nindependent voice that we need.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/25/senate-section/article/S5208-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n Mr. SALAZAR.

Mr. President, in the spirit of Memorial Day, which is \nfast approaching, I rise today to pay tribute to two sons of South \nDakota who dedicated and ultimately sacrificed their lives for their \ncountry. These men died on battlefields far from home, to protect us \nand to advance the cause of freedom. LT Robert Kenneth Thompson and SSG \nGregory Wagner both died in service to this great nation at very \ndifferent times in America's history. They fought in conflicts many \nyears apart, but both understood the importance of preserving and \npromoting freedom. On this Memorial Day, it is appropriate to remember \nnot only those who have fallen in the present conflict in Iraq, but \nthose who have fallen in previous conflicts as well.\n  LT Robert Kenneth Thompson of Flandreau, SD, was inducted into the \nUnited States Army on December 27, 1948. At the time of his death, LT \nThompson was on assignment fighting in the Korean conflict. He was \nkilled in action on February 12, 1951 north of Hoengsong, Korea while \nserving as a member of Battery A, 503rd Field Artillery.\n  Lieutenant Thompson had served in the United States Army for just \nover 2 years before his life was cut tragically short. LT Thompson \ndedicated his life to his country. He selflessly answered when duty \ncalled, even though it meant leaving his family behind. LT Thompson's \npatriotism and courage will not be forgotten.\n  Lieutenant Thompson is survived by his wife Doris and daughter Vicki. \nToday we remember his selfless dedication and service to all Americans, \nand his sacrifice will always have meaning to all future generations of \nAmericans, as long as our Republic exists.\n  SSG Gregory Wagner of Alexandria, SD, was a full-time heavy mobile \nequipment repairer for the National Guard in Mitchell's Battery A, \n147th Field Artillery and was deployed with the Yankton, SD unit. As a \nmember of the Battery C, 1st Battalion, 147th Field Artillery, he was \nchosen as the Task Force 519th Military Police Battalion ``Hero of the \nWeek'', having distinguished himself with his remarkable achievements. \nHis mission in Iraq involved training and educating the Iraqi police \nforce.\n  SSG Wagner made the ultimate sacrifice on May 8, 2006 during his \nservice in Iraq. He was honored with a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart. \nHe will be remembered for his loyalty and dedication to his family, \nfriends, fellow service-members, and his country.\n  SSG Wagner was a devoted, small-town guy who graduated from Hanson \nHigh in 1989. He was an admirer of his father, Charles Wagner, who \nserved in the military as a sergeant in the U.S. Army. Each year at the \nMemorial Day services in Alexandria, SD, Charles would read the roll of \nsoldiers. When he passed away, Greg stood in his place. My heart goes \nout to his mother, Velma, to all his siblings, and to his community as \nSGT Wagner's name is read at this year's Memorial Day service.\n  LT Thompson and SSG Wagner both laid down their lives for their \ncountry, and to free others from tyranny. While we are currently \nengaged in a very different kind of war, nothing has changed in that \nwhich we are ultimately trying to protect. For my freedom and for your \nfreedom and to spread this freedom across the globe, our soldiers have \nrisked and sacrificed their lives. On this Memorial Day, as we pause to \nreflect on those who have died so that we all might live in freedom, we \ncan do no more to honor them than to remain dedicated to the same \nprinciples for which they stood and devoted their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/25/senate-section/article/S5208-3", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5208-S5210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MEMORIAL DAY 2006\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to those men \nand women of the United States Armed Services who have given their \nlives to defend our Nation and the ideals it represents.\n  Numerous times in the history of our Nation, the men and women of our\n\n[[Page S5209]]\n\nArmed Forces have been called upon to defend the freedom we hold so \ndear. Sadly, many of those brave individuals never returned to the \nhomes and families they selflessly left behind. Today, we honor their \nsacrifice and ensure that we as a nation will never forget the debt of \ngratitude that is owed them.\n  New Mexicans have a long and notable history of military service. \nDuring the Spanish American War, New Mexico guardsmen served with Teddy \nRoosevelt and his Rough Riders at the Battle of San Juan Hill. New \nMexicans of the 1st Infantry Regiment fought with the 40th Infantry \nDivision in France after the U.S. entered the First World War. While \nparticipating in the Italian campaign of the Second World War, new \nMexicans of the 104th Tank Destroyer battalion were awarded 8 Silver \nStars, 60 Bronze Stars, and 135 Purple Hearts. Of course no one will \nforget the contribution Navajos from my home state made as ``code \ntalkers'' or the bravery of the ``New Mexico Brigade'' in the \nPhilippines during World War II. During the Vietnam War, the l88th \nTactical Fighter Squadron of the New Mexico Air National Guard flew \nover 6,000 combat sorties and amassed over 630 medals and decorations \nbefore its release from Federal active duty in June 1969. These are \njust a few examples of the distinction with which New Mexicans have \nserved our Nation. From the swamps of Cuba to the jungles of Vietnam \nand the deserts of Iraq, many New Mexicans have given their lives on \nbehalf of America, and for these reasons on Memorial Day we honor these \nbrave men and women.\n  We must never forget the sacrifices of our solders, sailors, airmen \nand marines. I encourage New Mexicans and all Americans on this \nMemorial Day to take a moment to remember and honor the brave men and \nwomen who have fallen in our defense. I ask that New Mexicans think of \nthem and their families, and give thanks that we are blessed with such \nheroic men and women.\n  On this Memorial Day, let us not overlook the men and women of our \narmed forces who since September 11, 2001 have been called away from \nhome to fight the Global War on Terror. Many of these individuals are \nNational Guardsmen like the members of Task Force Phoenix serving in \nAfghanistan, the 1116th Transportation Company serving in Iraq and Task \nForce Cobra serving in Kuwait. I would like to thank them and all the \nmen and women of our State who have returned from previous deployments \noverseas. Not only have they made their family and state proud, they \nhave made their country proud as well.\n  Today I would like to make special mention of those New Mexicans of \nthe active and reserve military who have given their lives in Operation \nIraqi Freedom and the Global War on Terror. They, like Americans of \ngenerations past, answered the call to defend this great Nation from \nthose who would do it harm. In the spirit of the efforts put forth by \nsuch individuals, it is imperative America forever remain the land of \nthe free and the home of the brave.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, Memorial Day is a time for solemn \nremembrance and reflection. We remember the brave men and women who \ngave their lives in defense of our Nation. At cemeteries and memorials \nacross America, in tributes both public and private, we gather to honor \nthose who died in service to our country. On May 12, members of the SGT \nJohn Rice family of Winnebago, NE, paid final tribute to his wife \nEvelyn who was buried at Arlington National Cemetery next to her \nhusband. The history of John and Evelyn Rice serves as an important \nreminder of the sacrifices soldiers and their families make in defense \nof freedom.\n  Sergeant Rice, a Winnebago Native American, was born on Nebraska's \nWinnebago reservation in 1914. After high school, he began looking for \nan opportunity outside of reservation life. He found that opportunity \nby serving in the U.S. Army during World War II. Rice received a Purple \nHeart after being wounded and was discharged from the Army in 1945. \nRice reenlisted in the Army in 1946, and among the many duties Rice \nperformed were escorting the bodies of war casualties being brought \nback to the U.S. to be buried.\n  Rice's service again brought him into battle in 1950 during the Korea \nwar, where he was killed in combat early in the conflict. It wasn't \nuntil almost a year later that his body was finally returned home to \nWinnebago. Evelyn arranged for the burial to be at Memorial Park \nCemetery in Sioux City, IA, because it was close to the family and near \nWinnebago.\n  Sergeant Rice's funeral proceeded as planned on August 28, 1951. It \nwasn't until after Evelyn and the family left the funeral service that \ncemetery personnel discovered that Rice was Native American. Evelyn was \ntold that Sergeant Rice's burial would not be completed due to a \ncemetery rule that only Caucasians could be buried there. In an effort \nto try and solve the situation, the cemetery personnel proposed to \nEvelyn that she could sign a document stating that Rice was Caucasian \nand they would finish the burial. Evelyn rejected that offer and later \nstated that, ``When these men are in the army, they are all equal and \nthe same. I certainly thought they would be the same after death . . \n.''\n  Two military officers who were present at the funeral alerted Army \nofficials in Washington of the funeral's disruption. The day after \nRice's funeral, news of what happened reached President Harry S. \nTruman, and he offered Evelyn a space for her husband to be buried at \nArlington National Cemetery. Evelyn accepted the President's offer and \narrangements were made a few days later for a ceremony to take place at \nArlington National Cemetery with full military honors. Sergeant Rice is \nbelieved to be the first Native American soldier to be buried in \nArlington National Cemetery.\n  Evelyn Rice passed away last year at the age of 83 and was buried \nearlier this month next to her husband at Arlington National Cemetery. \nHer courage in refusing to accept anything less than respect and honor \nfor her husband's service and sacrifice is an example all Nebraskans \ncan be proud of. Evelyn Rice embodied the best of America's spirit by \nstanding up to injustice during a very difficult time for her and her \nfamily, community and country.\n  We must be vigilant in our efforts to remember the sacrifices of \nthose we honor on Memorial Day. I authored a Senate resolution, which \nis now law, to observe a National Moment of Remembrance at 3 p.m. local \ntime each Memorial Day. Reserving this moment to reflect on Memorial \nDay is one way to honor those who died in service to our country. I ask \neveryone to join me this Memorial Day in honoring America's fallen \nheroes and their families, like SGT John and Evelyn Rice, and thank all \nthose who have served their country in uniform.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, Memorial Day is a day we have set aside to \nremember those who have given their lives--``the last full measure of \ndevotion''--in service to our country.\n  As President Abraham Lincoln looked out across the cemetery at \nGettysburg, he honored the sacrifice of the soldiers who had died there \nand how their sacrifices preserved the Union and advanced the cause of \nfreedom.\n  For more than 200 years, men--and later, women--have donned the \nuniform and met the many challenges of serving our great Nation and the \nideals on which it was founded. Countless numbers of them have paid the \nultimate price--and we honor them today.\n  Our freedom was not free. It was bought and paid for by the \nsacrifices of generations that have gone before. We honor these heroes \nfor their courage and for ensuring that our own freedom is more than a \ndream--that it is indeed a reality.\n  Those who fought in our country's Civil War are long passed. And many \nof those brave men who served in our World Wars too have passed. \nMembers of what we fondly call the ``greatest generation'' are leaving \nour midst in record numbers, and we mourn their passing--these brave \nmen who liberated so many from tyranny. They are gone, but they \ncertainly are not forgotten.\n  Memorial Day is not merely the opportunity for a 3-day weekend. It is \nour duty--indeed, it is our privilege--to reflect on the sacrifices \nthat have paid the price for our freedoms.\n  We must also acknowledge the heroism and sacrifice of our brave men \nand women currently serving in the Armed Forces. I know I speak for the \npeople of my State of Texas, and for all Americans, when I thank our \nsoldiers,\n\n[[Page S5210]]\n\nsailors, airmen and marines--and their loved ones waiting patiently at \nhome--for their service and their dedication to duty.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee, it is my job and my \nhonor to look after the interests of all of our military personnel. We \nmust ensure that the military continues to have the tools it needs to \nremain the most powerful fighting force the world has ever known.\n  Our Texas military bases are some of the strongest components of our \nmilitary readiness in the current global war against terror. These \nvaluable assets help to maintain our status as the world's lone \nsuperpower, even as we transform our military to face the challenges of \nthe future.\n  Soldiers are not just numbers or statistics. These are real \nAmericans. True patriots. They have real families. When someone leaves \nhome to fight for American interests abroad, it affects their entire \ncommunity; it affects their friends and, most profoundly, it affects \ntheir families.\n  And so while we must remember the sacrifices of the brave men and \nwomen who fight on the battlefield, we must also be mindful of the \nsacrifices of those they leave behind--and so on behalf of a grateful \nnation, I thank them today, as well.\n  The difference our military is making in the world is undeniable. \nJust a short while ago, the idea that the Iraqi people could live free \nwas a concept that many would not treat seriously. But the Iraqi people \nare forging ahead and have formed a unity government and are firmly \nembracing the opportunities that freedom provides.\n  I wish there were more balance in this discussion about Iraq. There \nare so many good things happening there--so many good things. And \nlargely, unfortunately, they are left unreported.\n  Recently, Jack Kelly, former marine, Green Beret, and deputy \nassistant secretary of the Air Force during the Reagan administration, \nhighlighted some of these important stories--for example, the account \nof marine Sgt Rafael Peralta, who has been posthumously recommended for \nthe Medal of Honor.\n  I quote: ``Sgt. Peralta was killed on Nov. 15, 2004, during the \nsecond battle of Fallujah. His squad was clearing a house. Sgt. Peralta \nwas the first into a room where at least three insurgents lay in \nambush. He was shot in the chest and the face, but still had the \npresence of mind to jump into an adjoining room to give the marines \nbehind him a clear field of fire.\n  Four marines maneuvered into the room where Sgt. Peralta lay when an \ninsurgent tossed a grenade into it. Sgt. Peralta pulled the grenade to \nhim and smothered it with his body, saving the others from death or \nserious injury.\n  Sgt. Rafael Peralta died for a country he loved, but of which he was \nnot yet a citizen. A Mexican immigrant who lived in San Diego, Sgt. \nPeralta enlisted in the marines the day he received his green card.\n  ``Be proud of being an American,'' Sgt. Peralta had written to his \nyounger brother in the only letter he ever sent him.\n  While this is only one story, there are hundreds more that should be \nacknowleged.\n  In recent correspondence, Iraqi Freedom veteran Major Mark McDaniel \nof the 301st Fighter Wing in Fort Worth wrote these words: ``Our \nefforts there in providing security enabled these courageous people to \nwork through the sectarian issues that existed . . . I believe that \nthis weekend has vindicated our presence and our sacrifices in Iraq. I, \nand the other members of the 301st Fighter Wing . . . believe in our \nmission there.''\n  And we here at home believe in our men and women in uniform--in their \ncourage and the cause of freedom they defend. We must always remember \nour Nation's heroes and live in a manner worthy of their sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/25/senate-section/article/S5210-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5210-S5211]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    ASSISTING PEOPLE AFFECTED BY HUNGER AND POVERTY AROUND THE WORLD\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, 850 million people around the world go \nhungry every day. Famine and hunger destroy the lives of those who \nalready suffer from extreme poverty, violence, and loss. Each instance \nis heartbreaking, but all too often we turn a blind eye to those in \nneed. As a person of faith, and a board member of Bread for the World, \nI believe we can do more to help the most vulnerable throughout the \nworld, and I want to draw the Senate's attention to a handful of \ncountries devastated by poverty and hunger.\n  For over 40 years, Colombia has been engaged in an armed conflict \nbetween insurgent guerrilla groups and the Colombian military. This \nviolence, exacerbated by decades of political instability and illegal \ndrug trafficking, has subjected thousands of innocent civilians to \nhuman rights abuses. Since taking office in 2002, President Alvaro \nUribe Velez has made strides in boosting the Colombian economy and \nstabilizing the political process. However, crime and widespread \nviolence continue to undermine these efforts.\n  Colombia has the third largest internally displaced population in the \nworld. Between 2 to 3 million people, out of a total population of 43 \nmillion, have been forced from their homes. On average, 350,000 people \nbecome internally displaced each year. Many flee to escape kidnappings, \nassassination attempts, and local violence linked to drug trafficking \nand the civil conflict.\n  Colombia's displaced population is in a dire state of need. Eighty \npercent of internally displaced people live in extreme poverty and lack \naccess to sufficient food. In fact, Colombian insurgents have \nincreasingly employed roadblocks and isolation tactics to stop food \nshipments from reaching vulnerable locations. All too often, internally \ndisplaced persons are forced to eat fewer meals, each of which consists \nof low nutritional value. The average daily caloric intake of an \ninternally displaced person is 1,752 calories--well below the \nrecommended minimum of 2,100 calories.\n  Another country ravaged by poverty and hunger is Haiti. Haiti is the \npoorest country in the Western Hemisphere, with 80 percent of the \npopulation living in poverty. In 2004, political unrest, coupled with \nsocial and economic instability and natural disasters, crippled a \nnation already in a state of extreme food insecurity.\n  The poor are particularly susceptible to chronic malnourishment. \nAlmost half of Haiti's 8.3 million citizens are undernourished. Even \nmore troubling, due to chronic malnourishment nearly half the children \nunder the age of five suffer from moderate to severe stunted growth. \nHaiti, along with Afghanistan and Somalia, experience the worst daily \ncaloric deficit per person in the world. The average Haitian consumes \nonly 460 kilocalories each day.\n  The United Nations World Food Program provides food assistance to \n600,000 Haitian people. While humanitarian relief programs like the \nWorld Food Program are a step in the right direction in eradicating \nhunger in Haiti, a number of factors are impeding efforts. Looting, \npoor road conditions, and a lack of security continue to hinder the \ndelivery of food aid in the country.\n  Africa has long battled systemic poverty, violence, and hunger. The \nDemocratic Republic of Congo, DRC, has been engulfed in political \nturmoil for over 8 years, resulting in the death of nearly 4 million \npeople. While the DRC is moving toward reunification and increased \npolitical stability, parts of the country remain highly volatile. \nWidespread violence, particularly in the eastern part of the country, \nhas resulted in the internal displacement of more than 3.4 million \npeople.\n  Civil conflict has also wreaked havoc on the country's agriculture \nindustry. In some areas, there is a lack of secure farmland, and severe \nlabor shortages and constant looting by combatants contribute to the \ncrisis. Oftentimes, raiders slaughter livestock, causing scarcity of \nmeat. In addition, efforts to increase the food supply have been \nthwarted by a widespread lack of basic education, job opportunities, \nand weak local implementing partners.\n  We cannot continue to ignore the current situation in the DRC while \nnearly 1,000 people die each day from war-related hunger and disease. \nSeventy-one percent of the Congolese population is undernourished and \nthe mortality rate has climbed to more than 50 percent due to \nstarvation.\n  In addition to the crisis in the DRC, Ethiopia is on the verge of a \nhumanitarian catastrophe. Ethiopia has the poorest human development \nindicators in the world. More than three-quarters\n\n[[Page S5211]]\n\nof Ethiopians live on less than $1 per day, and almost half the \npopulation is undernourished. Drought has plagued Ethiopia for decades, \nleaving the country stripped of the natural resources required to feed \nits citizens. During the past 20 years, five major droughts have \ndestroyed crops and livestock, and have left many people with few \npersonal belongings.\n  Ethiopia is of strategic importance to the United States, and its \nstability is crucial to the Horn of Africa and our efforts in the \nglobal war on terrorism. Ethiopia shares borders with nations plagued \nby civil war and government instability, which impede famine relief \nefforts. In response to the famine in Ethiopia, USAID is transitioning \nits emergency response famine program to be more proactive. Revamping \nthis program will help stimulate economic growth in the country. The \nhope is to permanently reduce famine-related poverty and hunger by \nincreasing the government's capacity to respond effectively to these \ncrises. In addition, famine relief efforts will be assisted by \nnongovernmental organizations, the private sector, and local \ncommunities and households.\n  Finally, years of internal armed conflict and political instability \nhave caused severe food shortages in Sudan. Southern Sudan, ravaged by \ncivil war, may face the return of millions of internally displaced \npeople following the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in \nJanuary 2005. A quarter of the Sudanese population is undernourished, \nand an estimated 3 million people will be in need of food assistance as \nthey return to their homes.\n  In western Sudan, the violence in the Darfur region has culminated in \nthe first genocide of this century. In February 2003, fighting erupted \nbetween rebel groups and government backed militias. The United Nations \nestimates that more than 70,000 people have been killed in this \nconflict, while other organizations believe the actual number is three \nto four times higher. As a result of ongoing ethnic violence, \napproximately 2 million people have been internally displaced, and \n220,000 refugees have fled to neighboring Chad.\n  Famine remains a distinct possibility, with need far outweighing the \nability of government and nongovernment agencies to deliver food aid. \nPrior to the crisis in Darfur, an estimated 18 percent of Sudanese \nsuffered from natural malnutrition. Today, 3.5 million people in Darfur \nare hungry, with numbers expected to skyrocket until the conflict is \nresolved. Relief efforts have slowed considerably due to widespread \nviolence. Furthermore, refugees and internally displaced people are not \nexpected to return to their homes for the next planting season. As the \nrainy season approaches, flooding will likely hamper our ability to \nadequately distribute food aid. Finally, the World Food Program \nrecently announced that it must reduce daily rations in Darfur and \neastern Sudan to as little as 1,050 kilocalories, or 50 percent of the \ndaily minimum requirement, due to funding shortfalls.\n  I briefly described the food shortage crises facing five impoverished \nand vulnerable countries. This is a snapshot of the reality millions \nface each day--including those who live in the United States. Each \nstatistic represents a person struggling to survive, not knowing where \ntheir next meal will come from--if it will come at all. In many \nsituations, people remain poor and powerless with virtually no hope of \nbreaking the cycle of despair. We can no longer use ignorance as an \nexcuse for our inaction.\n  Without question, assisting fellow human beings in need is a moral \nissue. However, in many of these war-torn and troubled nations it is \nalso an issue of national security. Countries that are politically \nunstable and ravaged by hunger and disease are often breeding grounds \nfor terror and violence. After all, it wasn't long ago that Osama bin \nLaden based his operations in Sudan in order to export terrorism and \nattack innocent civilians.\n  As our world becomes increasingly interconnected, poverty abroad \ncannot be ignored. Political instability and infectious disease know no \nborder and can affect us at home. Sadly, too often instances of extreme \nhunger and famine do not invoke action among the world's most powerful \nnations until it is too late--leaving millions dead or forever \nsuffering from the consequences of chronic malnutrition. Our inaction \nis not because we don't care, but I do believe the United States should \nbe more proactive, and not reactive, in ending hunger and poverty.\n  The Federal budget is a reflection of our Nation's values and \npriorities. The Bush administration has made clear its priorities by \nextending tax cuts to the fabulously wealthy, while deeply cutting \nfunds for hunger prevention and poverty programs. Less than half of 1 \npercent of our budget goes to fighting poverty, hunger, and disease. \nThe United States is the most powerful and wealthy nation in the world. \nWe should be a leader in ending hunger and poverty, and we can begin by \nstanding up for those at home and abroad who are in dire need of \nassistance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/25/senate-section/article/S5211-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5211-S5213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DARFUR PEACE AGREEMENT AND SUDAN\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, for nearly 3 years, the Government of \nSudan has conducted genocide in Darfur. The United Nations, the African \nUnion, the U.S. State Department, and many other organizations possess \ndetailed descriptions of these crimes against humanity. This enormous \nbody of evidence demonstrates unequivocally that the Government of \nSudan and its jingaweit proxies have attacked, uprooted, raped, \nstarved, enslaved, and killed millions of civilians.\n  In Congress, we have written letters, introduced and adopted \nlegislation, and spoken out strongly. We have supported the African \nUnion peacekeepers, the international relief workers, and the people of \nDarfur. In March, I sent a letter to President Bush detailing 13 steps \nthat should be taken to address the crises in Sudan. I reiterate the \nsteps that are suggested. These include appointment of a Presidential \nEnvoy to Sudan; rapid preparation and deployment of additional, well-\nequipped, robustly-mandated international peacekeepers to Darfur; \nurgent assistance to the African Union, including by NATO; and \nmultilateral enforcement of existing U.N. resolutions that establish a \nno-fly zone over Darfur and hold accountable those who have committed \ncrimes.\n  Thousands of Americans, including many New Yorkers, have taken a \nstrong and personal interest in the crisis in Darfur. I have heard \ntheir voices and frustration. The situation on the ground is still \ndire. As we lament this crisis today, four million people in Darfur and \neastern Chad now depend on relief organizations for survival--one \nmillion more than a year ago.\n  The alarm issued on May 19 by the United Nations Under Secretary \nGeneral for Humanitarian Affairs, Jan Egeland, is therefore especially \ndistressing. Despite the hopeful signing of the Darfur Peace Agreement \non May 5 by the Government of Sudan and one of the main Darfur rebel \ngroups, the work of aid workers remains sharply constrained by \nviolence, funding shortfalls, and restrictions being imposed by the \nGovernment of Sudan. Civilians continue to be attacked and sexually-\nbrutalized by Sudanese armed forces, the jingaweit, and rebel groups. \nOn May 19, Mr. Egeland warned, ``We can turn the corner towards \nreconciliation and reconstruction, or see an even worse collapse of our \nefforts to provide protection and relief to millions of people.'' In \neastern Chad, Mr. Egeland said, ``we are confronted with a very \ndangerous vacuum that is being filled by rebels, militia and others, \nleaving civilians, internally displaced persons, refugee camps and \nrelief workers utterly exposed.''\n  In the context of Sudan's history, this post-peace agreement reality \nis not unique. Nor is it surprising. The genocide in Darfur, in the \nwest, began just as the Government of Sudan concluded a horrific, 20-\nyear campaign of violence in the south--a campaign that laid waste to \nthe institutions and infrastructure of southern Sudan. That conflict \nwas brought to an end more than 1 year ago through the Comprehensive \nPeace Agreement (CPA)--but conditions in southern Sudan remain grim. \nDeputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick said recently that the \nchallenge in southern Sudan is not one of re-construction, but rather \nof basic construction; years of conflict have destroyed nearly \neverything.\n  Even so, the National Congress Party in Khartoum--the signatory to \nthe CPA with the means and the mandate\n\n[[Page S5212]]\n\nto implement many of its provisions--has moved ahead very slowly and \nselectively. Khartoum is failing to deliver on some of the most \nimportant provisions of the CPA, including those related to the \nresolution of disputed boundaries, the sharing of oil wealth, and the \ntimely withdrawal of armed forces. Displaced and enslaved southerners \nare not being returned as promised to their homes. Incursions by the \nLord's Resistance Army and other armed groups continue, often with \nimpunity. Amidst these circumstances, the Government of Southern Sudan \nfaces great challenges in providing basic goods to the people--basic \ngoods such as roads, electricity, schools, hospitals, food, and clean \nwater. By dragging its feet and turning a blind eye, Khartoum is \nabdicating its commitments under the CPA, and perpetuating the \nsuffering of the southern Sudanese.\n  If things do not change quickly in southern Sudan, today's fragility \nmay tomorrow become chaos, with grave and deadly consequences for \nmillions of civilians. The United States can, and must, do more. We \nshould support the continued development of the Government of Southern \nSudan, and urgently assist its provision of food, health care, shelter, \nand security to the southern peoples. In addition, we should expedite \nthe safe, voluntary return of displaced southerners to their homes and \nfamilies.\n  More broadly, we should closely monitor security conditions, \nhumanitarian access, and implementation of the peace agreements in both \nsouthern Sudan and Darfur. We must hold the signatories to their word \nand bring other groups on board. The Government of Sudan must fulfill \nits pledges to desist from military offensives; accept international \npeacekeepers; disarm the jingaweit by mid-October, 2006; and take clear \nsteps to share power and wealth with the south and west. Members and \nsponsors of the jingaweit should be held accountable for their gruesome \ncrimes, and not simply integrated into the national army. Relief \nworkers and supplies must immediately be provided free and safe access \nto the peoples of Sudan--by the rebels, the jingaweit, and the \nGovernment of Sudan. If the National Congress Party in Khartoum fails \nto uphold its commitments or its broader obligations under \ninternational law, it must face consequences--especially if its failure \nerodes the security of civilians or aid workers. The possible sanctions \nand no-fly zone that have been authorized by the U.N. Security Council \ncan compel compliance. In the meantime, to transform the Darfur Peace \nAgreement into peace, we need to immediately strengthen the African \nUnion's ability to protect civilians and aid workers.\n  Even with the commendable field work of the African Union, the United \nNations, and many relief organizations, we must not lose focus on the \ncurrent problems in Sudan. We must urgently support the work of these \npartners and together ensure that peace and justice prevail for the \npeoples of Sudan.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   March 15, 2006.\n     Hon. George W. Bush,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I write with great concern about the \n     crisis in Sudan. Despite the work of the African Union, \n     violence against civilians and aid workers in Darfur is \n     increasing and spilling across the border into Chad. Between \n     200,000 and 400,000 people have been killed, and United \n     Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and other credible \n     experts continue to warn that three million civilians are \n     displaced and at risk in Darfur and in eastern Chad. The \n     situation in eastern Sudan is also of concern.\n       The United States and United Nations (U.N.) now possess \n     extensive, official accounts of the violence and, through a \n     U.N. Panel of Experts and other sources, we also know who may \n     be responsible. The Government of Sudan--reported by the U.S. \n     State Department on March 8, 2006 to be responsible for the \n     genocide in Darfur--continues to deny the existence of a \n     crisis. It continues to threaten retaliation against an \n     international intervention, and, according to a U.N. report \n     dated January 30, 2006, it continues to introduce additional \n     military aircraft into Darfur. The United States can and must \n     do more. Below are 13 ways in which you can take action.\n       Convene a meeting of world leaders to address the crisis in \n     Darfur. For 100 weeks, the international community has \n     watched, with little meaningful response, as the first \n     genocide of this millennium has been carried out by the \n     Government of Sudan against the people of Darfur. I urge you \n     to convene, without delay, a meeting between leaders of the \n     United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) \n     and the African Union, and other interested world leaders, to \n     map out an action-plan for Darfur. The millions of displaced \n     victims in Darfur deserve at least this much.\n       Appoint a Presidential Envoy to Sudan. To promote lasting \n     peace in both Darfur and eastern Sudan, and to demonstrate \n     U.S. commitment to peace negotiations and agreements, I urge \n     you to consider the appointment of a Presidential Envoy to \n     Sudan. Like Senator Danforth, your previous Envoy to Sudan, a \n     new Envoy should participate personally in peace talks, \n     oversee and coordinate U.S. engagement in Sudan, and report \n     directly to you on these efforts.\n       Lead the U.N. Security Council in authorizing a \n     peacekeeping mission in Darfur. To protect civilians from \n     continued violence--much of which is documented explicitly in \n     a 42-page U.N. report published on January 27 and the U.N. \n     Secretary-General's monthly reports to the Security Council--\n     I urge you to push the U.N. Security Council to authorize, \n     under Chapter VII, a U.N. peacekeeping mission in Darfur.\n       On January 12 and March 10, 2006, the African Union \n     endorsed this mission in principle. U.N. Secretary-General \n     Kofi Annan has begun planning this mission, in accordance \n     with the U.N. Security Council's Presidential Statement of \n     February 3, 2006.\n       Efforts to broker a peace agreement for Darfur must not \n     forestall efforts to protect civilians. Our continued \n     inaction will enable the killings to continue. This fact \n     cannot be ignored.\n       A U.N. mission in Darfur must now be authorized with a \n     clear and robust mandate to protect civilians; and be \n     supplied with the troops, air- and ground-mobility, and \n     communications network required to fully implement that \n     mandate.\n       The Government of Sudan must either cooperate with this \n     mission or face sanctions, in accordance with the existing \n     U.N. Security Council Resolutions that are described below.\n       Support the African Union. According to U.N. officials, \n     deployment of U.N. peacekeepers to Darfur may take six to \n     nine months. To protect civilians in the interim, I urge you \n     to support the African Union peacekeeping mission in Darfur \n     in two ways. First, I urge you to support the funding needs \n     of the African Union mission for the next nine months. As you \n     know, the United States' share of these costs is estimated at \n     $10 million per month.\n       Second, in accordance with United States Senate Resolution \n     383, which I co-sponsored, I urge you to lead NATO in \n     providing assistance to the A.U. peacekeepers in Darfur, \n     particularly in the areas of command and control, logistics, \n     intelligence, and airlift. I called for NATO assistance in \n     Darfur more than 12 months ago, at the Munich Conference on \n     Security. Since then, NATO has been helpful, particularly \n     with airlift, but it can and should do more.\n       Third, to improve the ability of the existing African Union \n     peacekeepers to deter violence, I urge you to explore \n     mechanisms that would provide African Union commanders in \n     Darfur with specific, timely, standardized information about \n     imminent attacks against civilians in Darfur.\n       Enforce the no-fly zone that has been established by the \n     U.N. Security Council and endorsed by the U.S. Congress. \n     Despite the enactment of a no-fly zone by the U.N. Security \n     Council in March 2005--nearly one year ago--the Government of \n     Sudan continues its aerial assaults against civilians in \n     Darfur. This is unacceptable, and I urge you to work with \n     members of NATO, the U.N. Security Council, and the African \n     Union to immediately enforce the ban on offensive overhead \n     flights in Darfur that was established by Security Council \n     Resolution 1591.\n       On March 2, 2006, the U.S. Senate adopted Resolution 383 \n     calling on you to take steps to enforce the no-fly zone in \n     Darfur. Senator Biden and others have suggested that \n     enforcement of the flight ban would require no more than 12 \n     to 18 fighter planes and a handful of AWACs. I urge you to \n     work with other countries to mobilize these resources, and to \n     ensure that the Government of Sudan ceases its overhead \n     assaults. Our continued failure on this issue is \n     unacceptable.\n       Similarly, I urge you to raise with Khartoum the findings \n     of a U.N. report dated January 30, 2006, which suggest that \n     the Government of Sudan continues to introduce additional \n     offensive military aircraft into Darfur.\n       Lead the U.N. Security Council in enforcing Resolution \n     1591, to freeze the assets and travel of certain dangerous \n     individuals. I urge you to work with other members of the \n     U.N. Security Council to fully implement Resolution 1591, \n     which authorized the Security Council to impose travel bans \n     and asset freezes on any individuals believed by a Panel of \n     Experts to constitute a threat to stability, to violate \n     international human rights law, to impede the peace process, \n     or to conduct offensive overhead military flights.\n       The Panel of Experts has identified several individuals who \n     have perpetrated such violations of international law, and \n     these individuals must be prevented from organizing or \n     perpetrating additional violence, and be sanctioned in full \n     accordance with Resolution 1591. At the very least, the \n     Security\n\n[[Page S5213]]\n\n     Council should call the named individuals to the United \n     Nations for dialogue and questioning.\n       Lead the U.N. Security Council in enforcing Resolution \n     1564, to hold accountable the Government of Sudan for its \n     documented failure to meet its international obligations to \n     end violence and protect civilians in Darfur. I urge you to \n     work with the U.N. Security Council to fully implement \n     Resolution 1564, which calls on the Security Council to \n     consider ``additional measures as contemplated in Article 41 \n     of the Charter of the United Nations, such as actions to \n     affect Sudan's petroleum sector and the Government of Sudan \n     or individual members of the Government of Sudan,'' if the \n     Government of Sudan fails its previous obligations under \n     international law, including U.N. Security Council Resolution \n     1556 and the Joint Communique dated July 3, 2004.\n       Several official reports, including a U.N. report published \n     on January 27, 2006, demonstrate unequivocally that the \n     Government of Sudan has failed its obligations. It has failed \n     to protect civilians in Darfur, and it has failed to punish \n     members of the military and the Janjaweed for violations of \n     international human rights law. These realities and \n     Resolution 1564 should now compel the Security Council to \n     consider Article 41 measures against the Government of Sudan.\n       Ensure that the U.N. Security Council listens to the \n     experts. I urge you to convene a briefing for members of the \n     Security Council by experts who can describe the situation in \n     Darfur, eastern Chad, and eastern Sudan. The Security Council \n     should hear testimony from Juan Mendez, Special Advisor to \n     the Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide. As you \n     know, the Security Council did not allow Mr. Mendez to \n     present his observations in October 2005.\n       Stop the violence from spreading into Chad. I urge you to \n     monitor tensions along the Chad-Sudan border and to focus the \n     U.N. Security Council on this important issue. The U.N. \n     Secretary-General noted in his January 30 report to the \n     Security Council that ``there has been a worrying build-up of \n     armed forces of the two States and local militias on both \n     sides of the border,'' and that ``it is vitally important \n     that the situation in the border areas of Chad and the \n     conflicts in the Sudan do not combine to propel the two \n     countries and the whole region towards confrontation and \n     conflict.''\n       More specifically, I urge you to work with the Security \n     Council and the African Union to monitor implementation of \n     the February 8, 2006 accord between the Presidents of Chad \n     and Sudan, and to deter all parties from escalating the \n     conflict. The safety of at least three million civilians \n     along the Chad-Sudan border depends on your attention to this \n     issue.\n       Call publicly for better behavior from Khartoum. Using \n     Resolutions 1591 and 1564 and other points of leverage, I \n     urge you to call on the Government of Sudan--particularly the \n     National Congress Party in Khartoum--to immediately desist \n     from violence against civilians; protect safe passage for aid \n     workers; cooperate fully with international peacekeepers; \n     engage constructively in the peace talks in Abuja; diffuse \n     tensions along the Chad-Sudan border; and disarm and punish \n     the Janjaweed and other groups responsible for genocidal \n     violence in Darfur.\n       I urge you to call similarly on the Government of Sudan to \n     implement the Comprehensive Peace Agreement without delay and \n     in full consultation with the Government of Southern Sudan, \n     and to protect civilians and peacefully address the situation \n     in eastern Sudan.\n       Work with the U.N. Security Council to address attacks by \n     rebel groups in Darfur. I urge you to work with the Security \n     Council to make it clear to all rebels and perpetrators of \n     violence in Sudan and Chad that attacks against civilians and \n     aid workers are violations of international law; and that \n     continued international consideration of their grievances \n     depends directly upon their immediate cessation of violence \n     against civilians.\n       Plan for reconstruction in Darfur. Through a new \n     Presidential Envoy or other U.S. officials, I urge you to \n     begin working with the World Bank and other stakeholders on a \n     Joint Assessment Mission to plan for reconstruction in \n     Darfur. This may help to accelerate the peace process by \n     demonstrating to the Darfur rebels and the Government of \n     Sudan that peace can bring financial dividends, and, once \n     peace has been established, it will help to speed \n     reconstruction and promote stability.\n       Support reconstruction in southern Sudan. I urge you to \n     provide strong, material support to the Government of \n     Southern Sudan as it builds a stable state, economy, and \n     society in the wake of decades of conflict. Similarly, I urge \n     you to encourage the Government of Southern Sudan to engage \n     constructively in the Darfur peace negotiations.\n       During the last century, in Nazi Europe, Cambodia, and \n     elsewhere, the international community failed to protect \n     millions of innocent people from genocide and horrific \n     crimes. We look back and wonder how the world allowed those \n     killings to continue. We must find a way to protect civilians \n     in Darfur, without further delay.\n       As you know, I and other members of the U.S. Congress \n     recognized the genocide in Darfur in July 2004. In September \n     2004, then Secretary of State Colin Powell did the same. A \n     few months later, in January 2005, a U.N. International \n     Commission of Inquiry established by U.N. Security Council \n     Resolution 1564 also found strong evidence of genocide in \n     Darfur. In February 2006, Secretary of State Rice said that \n     ``genocide was committed and in fact continues in Darfur.'' \n     Even so, international agreement on the existence of genocide \n     has little connection to the need or basis for action.\n       Hundreds of acts of violence in Darfur, many constituting \n     crimes against humanity and war crimes--along with specific \n     descriptions of the perpetrators--have been recorded in \n     detail by the U.S. State Department, the United Nations, the \n     African Union, the NGO community, and other organizations. I \n     urge you to read these gruesome accounts, and to also review \n     the list of individuals who have been identified by the U.N.\n       Panel of Experts established by U.N. Security Council \n     Resolution 1591. In the case of Darfur, we are now obligated \n     by the U.N. Charter, the Responsibility to Protect, several \n     statutes of international human rights law, and existing U.N. \n     Security Council resolutions to transform our awareness into \n     action.\n       Therefore, I urge you, as President of the United States, \n     to remind the international community of its commitments and \n     to work urgently with the United Nations, the African Union, \n     and NATO to protect civilians and address the growing crises \n     in Darfur, eastern Chad, and eastern Sudan. Thank you for \n     your attention to these urgent matters.\n           Sincerely,\n     Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/25/senate-section/article/S5213-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5213-S5216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DISSENT TO THE UNITED STATES COMMISSION ON CIVIL RIGHTS REPORT ON S. \n                                  147\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to share information about S. \n147, the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2005. Some of \nmy colleagues have made reference to a recent report issued by the U.S. \nCommission on Civil Rights which characterizes my bill as race-based \nlegislation. The report itself, however, does not contain any \nsubstantive analysis. Rather, it outlines the testimony that was \npresented to the commission.\n  I have already shared with my colleagues my dismay and displeasure \nwith the manner in which the Commission considered S. 147. Not once did \nthey contact the Hawaii Advisory Committee to the Commission, which is \ncomposed of experts on Hawaii's history, Federal Indian Law, and \nFederal policies toward indigenous peoples. In addition, during the \nbriefing upon which this report is based, it was clear that certain \nCommissioners lacked a general understanding of Federal Indian law, a \nnecessary context to understand the existing political and legal \nrelationship between native Hawaiians and the United States.\n  Commissioner Michael Yaki understood both the history of Hawaii and \nFederal Indian Law and he, along with Commissioner Arlen Melendez, \ndissented from the Commission's position that S. 147 is race-based \nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent that Commissioner Yaki's dissent \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Dissenting Statement of Commissioner Yaki\n\n\n              Commissioner Melendez concurs in the dissent\n\n     PREFACE\n       As a person quite possibly with native Hawaiian blood \n     running through his veins, it is quite possible to say that I \n     cannot possibly be impartial when it comes to this issue. \n     And, in truth, that may indeed be the fact. Nevertheless, \n     even before my substantive objections are made known, from a \n     process angle there were serious and substantial flaws in the \n     methodology underlying the report.\n       First, the report relies upon a briefing from a grand total \n     of 4 individuals, on an issue that has previously relied upon \n     months of research and fact gathering that has led to 2 State \n     Advisory Commission reports, 1 Department of Justice Report, \n     and Congressional action (the ``Apology Resolution''), not to \n     mention testimony before the Congress on the NHGRA bill \n     itself that was never incorporated into the record.\n       The paucity of evidence adduced is hardly the stuff upon \n     which to make recommendations or findings. Even though the \n     Commission, to its credit, stripped the report of all its \n     findings for its final version, does that not itself lend \n     strength and credence to the suggestion that the briefing was \n     flawed from the inception? And if so flawed, how can the \n     Commission opine so strongly upon a record that it could not \n     even find supported now non-existent findings?\n       Second, aside from ignoring the volumes of research and \n     testimony that lie elsewhere and easily available to the \n     Commission, we ignored soliciting advice and comment from our \n     own State Advisory Commission of Hawai'i. Over the past two \n     decades, the Hawai`i Advisory Committee to the United States \n     Commission on Civil Rights (HISAC) has examined issues \n     relating to federal and state\n\n[[Page S5214]]\n\n     relations with Native Hawaiians. As early as 1991, HISAC \n     recommended legislation confirming federal recognition of \n     Native Hawaiians. A mere five years ago, the HISAC found that \n     ``the lack of federal recognition for native Hawaiians \n     appears to constitute a clear case of discrimination among \n     the native peoples found within the borders of this nation.'' \n     The HISAC concluded ``[a]bsent explicit recognition of a \n     Native Hawaiian governing entity, or at least a process for \n     ultimate recognition thereof, it is clear that the civil and \n     political rights of Native Hawaiians will continue to \n     erode.'' The HISAC found that ``the denial of Native Hawaiian \n     self-determination and self-governance to be a serious \n     erosion of this group's equal protection and human rights.'' \n     Echoing recommendations by the United States Departments of \n     Justice and Interior, the HISAC ``strongly recommend[ed]'' \n     that the federal government ``accelerate efforts to formalize \n     the political relationship between Native Hawaiians and the \n     United States.'' The HISAC's long-standing position of \n     support for legislation like S. 147 to protect the civil \n     rights of native Hawaiians belies recent assertions that such \n     legislation discriminates on the basis of race and causes \n     further racial divide.\n       The HISAC could and would have been a key source of \n     information, especially updated information, on the state of \n     the record. To exclude them from the dialogue I believe was \n     indefensible and a deliberate attempt to ensure that contrary \n     views were not introduced into the record.\n       Third, the report as it stands now makes no sense. The lack \n     of findings, the lack of any factual analysis, now makes the \n     report the proverbial Emperor without clothes. The conclusion \n     of the Commission stands without support, without backing, \n     and will be looked upon, I believe, as irrelevant to the \n     debate. Such if the risk one runs when scholarship and \n     balance are lacking.\n       Substantively, the recommendation of the Commission, cannot \n     stand either. It is not based on facts about the political \n     status of indigenous, Native Hawaiians, nor Native Hawaiian \n     history and governance or facts about existing U.S. policy \n     and law concerning Native Hawaiians. It is a misguided \n     attempt to start a new and destructive precedent in U.S. \n     policy toward Native Americans. The USCCR recommendation \n     disregards the U.S. Constitution that specifically addresses \n     the political relationship between the U.S. and the nations \n     of Native Americans. The USCCR disregarded facts when the \n     choice was made not to include HISAC in the January 2006 \n     briefing on NHGRA, and not utilizing the past relevant HISAC \n     reports concerning Native Hawaiians based on significant \n     public hearing and facts. Spring-boarding from trick phrasing \n     and spins offered by ill informed experts, and at least one \n     who has filed suit to end Native Hawaiian programs \n     established through Congress and state constitution, the \n     USCCR majority recommendation is an obvious attempt to treat \n     Native Hawaiians unfairly in order to begin the process of \n     destroying existing U.S. policy towards Native Americans.\n\n\n   Facts About Indigenous Native Hawaiians, Native Hawaiian and U.S. \nhistory and the distinct Native Hawaiian indigenous political community \n                                 today\n\n       Native Hawaiians are the indigenous people of Hawai`i, just \n     as American Indians and Alaska Natives are the indigenous \n     peoples of the remaining 49 states. Hawai`i is the homeland \n     of Native Hawaiians. Over 1200 years prior to the arrival of \n     European explorer James Cook on the Hawaiian islands, Native \n     Hawaiians self-determined their form of governance, culture, \n     way of life, priorities and economic system to cherish and \n     protect their homelands, of which they are physically and \n     spiritually a part, and did so continuously until the illegal \n     overthrow of their government by agents and citizens of the \n     U.S. government in 1893. In fact the U.S. engaged in several \n     treaties and conventions with the Native Hawaiian government, \n     including 1826, 1842, 1849, 1875 and 1887.\n       Though deprived of their inherent rights to self-\n     determination as a direct result of the illegal overthrow, \n     coupled with subsequent efforts to terminate Native Hawaiian \n     language, leaders, institutions and government functions, \n     Native Hawaiians persevered as best they could to perpetuate \n     the distinct vestiges of their culture, institutions, \n     homelands and government functions maintaining a distinct \n     community, recognizable to each other.\n       Today, those living in Hawai'i recognize these aspects of \n     the distinct, functioning Native Hawaiian political community \n     easily. For example: the Royal Benevolent Societies \n     established by Ali'i (Native Hawaiian chiefs and monarchs) \n     continue to maintain certain Native Hawaiian government \n     assigned and cultural functions; the private Ali'i Trusts, \n     such as Kamehameha Schools, Queen Lili`uokalani Trust, Queen \n     Emma Foundation and Lunalilo Home, joined by state government \n     entities established for indigenous Hawaiians, including the \n     Office of Hawaiian Affairs and the Department of Hawaiian \n     Homelands, and Native Hawaiian Serving institutions such as \n     Alu Like, Inc. and Queen Lili`uokalani Children's Center \n     continue the Native Hawaiian government functions of caring \n     for Native Hawaiian health, orphans and families, education, \n     elders, housing economic development, governance, community \n     wide communication and culture and arts; the resurgence of \n     teaching and perpetuation of Native Hawaiian language and \n     other cultural traditions; Native Hawaiian civic \n     participation in matters important to the Native Hawaiian \n     community are conducted extensively through Native Hawaiian \n     organizations including, the Association of Hawaiian Civic \n     Clubs, the State Council of Hawaiian Homestead Associations, \n     the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement, Ka Lahui and \n     various small groups pursuing independence; Native Hawaiian \n     family reunions where extended family members, young and old, \n     gather to talk, eat, pass on family stories and history, \n     sometimes sing and play Hawaiian music and dance hula and \n     pass on genealogy.\n       Indeed, if the briefing had been as consultative with the \n     HISAC as it could have been, there would have been testimony \n     that, for example, the Royal Order of Kamehameha, or the Hale \n     O Na Ali`I O Hawai`i, or the Daughters of Ka`ahumanu continue \n     to operate under principles consistent with the law of the \n     former Kingdom of Hawai`i. There would have been testimony \n     that these groups went ``underground'' due to persecution but \n     remained very much alive during that time.\n       The distinct indigenous, political community of Native \n     Hawaiians is recognized by Congress in over 150 pieces of \n     legislation, including the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act and \n     the conditions of statehood. Native Hawaiians are recognized \n     as a distinct indigenous, political community by voters of \n     Hawai`i, as expressed in the Hawai`i State Constitution.\n       The notion introduced by opponents to the NHGRA that the \n     Native Hawaiians don't ``fit'' Federal Regulations governing \n     recognition of Native American tribes because they lacked a \n     distinct political identity or continuous functional and \n     separate government would ignore all manifestations of such \n     identity, existence, and recognition noted above.\n\n\n              The NHGRA does not set new precedent in U.S.\n\n       The Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2005 \n     (NHGRA) is in fact a measure to establish fairness in U.S. \n     policy towards the 3 groups of Native Americans of the 50 \n     United States, American Indians, Alaska Natives and Native \n     Hawaiians. The U.S. already provides American Indians and \n     Alaska Natives access to a process of federal recognition, \n     and the NHGRA does the same for Native Hawaiians based on the \n     same Constitutional and statutory standing.\n\n         I. Legal Authorities Establishing OHA! Purpose of OHA\n\n       Hawai'i became the 50th State in the union in 1959 pursuant \n     to Pub. L. No. 86-3, 73 Stat. 5 (``Admission Act''). Under \n     this federal law, the United States granted the nascent state \n     title to all public lands within the state, except for some \n     lands reserved for use by the federal Government. These lands \n     (``public lands trust'') ``together with the proceeds from \n     the sale or other disposition of any such lands and the \n     income therefrom, shall be held by [the State] as a public \n     trust for the support of the public schools, . . . the \n     conditions of native Hawaiians'' and other purposes.\n       In 1978, the multicultural residents of Hawai'i voted to \n     amend its state Constitution to (1) establish the Office of \n     Hawaiian Affairs (``OHA'') to ``provide Hawaiians the right \n     to determine the priorities which will effectuate the \n     betterment of their condition and welfare and promote the \n     protection and preservation of the Hawaiian race, and . . . \n     [to] unite Hawaiians as a people;'' and (2) to establish the \n     public lands trust created by the Admission Act as a \n     constitutional obligation of the State of Hawaii to the \n     native people. The constitutional mandate for OHA was \n     implemented via the enactment of Chapter 10, Hawaii Revised \n     Statutes, in 1979. OHA's statutory purposes include \n     ``[a]ssessing the policies and practices of other agencies \n     impacting on native Hawaiians and Hawaiians,'' conducting \n     advocacy efforts for native Hawaiians and Hawaiians,'' \n     ``[a]pplying for, receiving, and disbursing, grants and \n     donations from all sources for native Hawaiian and Hawaiian \n     programs and services,'' and ``[s]erving as a vehicle for \n     reparations.'' OHA administers funds derived for the most \n     part from its statutory 20% share of revenues generated by \n     the use of the public lands trust.\n       Several legal challenges to the existence of OHA based upon \n     the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution have \n     been filed by various Plaintiffs, some of whom are \n     represented by Mr. Burgess. Mr. Burgess has thus far failed \n     to win the relief he has sought, including injunctive relief, \n     either in the United States District Court for the District \n     of Hawaii or the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth \n     Circuit. The denial of injunctive relief to Mr. Burgess's \n     clients presents a powerful rebuttal to their claims that \n     OHA's administration of its constitutional and statutory \n     obligations to native Hawaiians and Hawaiians deprives all \n     Hawaii's citizens of equal protection of law.\n       Mr. Burgess describes the ``driving force'' behind the \n     NHGRA as ``discrimination based upon ancestry''. Nothing \n     could be further from the truth or more illogical. The \n     ``driving force'' behind the creation and passage of NHGRA is \n     the desire of the Hawaiian people, and virtually every \n     political representative in the State of Hawaii to achieve \n     legal parity and federal recognition as with the other two \n     native indigenous peoples of America, namely American Indian \n     Nations and Native Alaskans. There is no constitutional \n     impediment to congressional federal recognition of the \n     Hawaiian people.\n       Then-United States Solicitor John Roberts (now Chief \n     Justice Roberts) argued in his prior legal briefs to the \n     United States Supreme Court in Rice v. Cayetano: ``[t]he \n     Constitution, in short, gives Congress room to\n\n[[Page S5215]]\n\n     deal with the particular problems posed by the indigenous \n     people of Hawaii and, at least when legislation is in \n     furtherance of the obligation Congress has assumed to those \n     people, that legislation is no more racial in nature than \n     legislation attempting to honor the federal trust \n     responsibility to any other indigenous people.'' It is, in \n     sum, ``not racial at all.''\n       Roberts went on to say: Congress is constitutionally \n     empowered to deal with Hawaiians, has recognized such a \n     ``special relationship,'' and--``[i]n recognition of th[at] \n     special relationship''--has extended to Native Hawaiians the \n     same rights and privileges accorded to American Indian, \n     Alaska Native, Eskimo, and Aleut communities.'' 20 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 7902(13) (emphasis added). As such, Congress has \n     established with Hawaiians the same type of ``unique legal \n     relationship'' that exists with respect to the Indian tribes \n     who enjoy the ``same rights and privileges'' accorded \n     Hawaiians under these laws. 42 U.S.C. Sec. 11701(19). That \n     unique legal or political status--not recognition of \n     ``tribal'' status, under the latest executive transmutation \n     of what that means--is the touchstone for application of \n     Mancari when, as here, Congress is constitutionally empowered \n     to treat an indigenous group as such.\n\n\n   NHGRA is a matter of indigenous political status and relationship \n between the U.S. and the Native Hawaiian government. and not a racial \n                                matter.\n\n       Under the U.S. Constitution and Federal law, America's \n     indigenous, native people are recognized as groups that are \n     NOT defined by race or ethnicity, but by the fact that their \n     indigenous, native ancestors exercised sovereignty over the \n     lands and areas that subsequently became part of the United \n     States. It is the pre-existing sovereignty, sovereignty that \n     pre-existed the formation of the United States which the U.S. \n     Constitution recognizes and on that basis, accords a special \n     status to America's indigenous, native people.\n       The tortured attempts by persons such as Mr. Burgess to \n     distinguish Native Hawaiians from Native Americans ultimately \n     fail by simple historical comparison. Like the Native \n     Americans, the Native Hawaiians pre-dated the establishment \n     of the United States. Like the Native Americans, the Native \n     Hawaiians had their own culture, form of government, and \n     distinct sense of identity. Like Native Americans, the United \n     States stripped them of the ownership of their land and \n     trampled over their sovereignty. The only distinction--one \n     without a difference--is that unlike the vast majority of \n     Native American tribes, the Native Hawaiians were not shipped \n     off, force-marched, and relocated to another area far from \n     their original homelands.\n       It is somewhat disingenuous that the opponents of NHGRA are \n     suggesting that extending this same U.S. policy to Native \n     Hawaiians, the indigenous, native people of the 50th state \n     would lead to racial balkanization. There are over 560 \n     federally recognized American Indian and Alaska Native \n     governing entities in 49 of 50 states, coexisting with all \n     peoples and federal, state and local governments. There is \n     absolutely NO evidence to support this notion, and seems to \n     be spread simply to instill unwarranted fear and opposition \n     to the NHGRA.\n\n\n                        NHGRA is Constitutional\n\n       In United States v. Lara, the Supreme Court held that \n     ``[t]he Constitution grants Congress broad general powers to \n     legislate in respect to Indian tribes powers that we have \n     consistently described as plenary and exclusive.'' In 1954, \n     Congress terminated the sovereignty of the Menominee Indian \n     Tribe in Wisconsin. In 1973, Congress exercised its \n     discretion, changed its mind, and enacted the Menominee \n     Restoration Act, which restored sovereignty to the Menominee \n     Tribe.\n       NHGRA does little more than follow the precedent allowed by \n     Lara and exercised in the Menominee case. Reliance on federal \n     regulations as gospel ignores the fact that the plenary \n     authority of Congress has resulted in restoration of tribal \n     status, in the case of the Menominee, and the retroactive \n     restoration of tribal lands, as in the case of the Lytton \n     Band in California. The Attorney General of Hawaii, many \n     distinguished professors, and the American Bar Association \n     all firmly believe that Congress has the authority to \n     recognize Native Hawaiians.\n       All that NHGRA seeks is parity in U.S. policies towards the \n     three indigenous, native people in the 50 states, American \n     Indians, Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians. Under the U.S. \n     Constitution and Federal law, America's indigenous, native \n     people are recognized as groups that are not defined by race \n     or ethnicity, but by the fact that their indigenous, native \n     ancestors, exercised sovereignty over the lands and areas \n     that subsequently became part of the United States. It is the \n     pre-existing sovereignty, sovereignty that pre-existed the \n     formation of the United States which the U.S. Constitution \n     recognizes and on that basis, accords a special status to \n     America's indigenous, native people.\n       If one accepts the Commission's pronouncement against \n     subdividing the country into ``discrete subgroups accorded \n     varying degrees of privilege,'' then the Commission should \n     immediately call for an end to any recognition of additional \n     Indian tribes. Since that would clearly contravene the \n     Constitutional authority of Congress, that would seem to be \n     an unlikely--and illegal--outcome. Given that the authority \n     for NHGRA stems from the same constitutional source as that \n     for Native Americans, then the Commission majority has chosen \n     to ignore the constitutionality of the proposed law.\n\n\n NHGRA has the support of the residents of Hawai`i as reflected in two \n scientific polls, the fact that the majority of officials elected by \n                  the voters of Hawai`i support NHGRA\n\n       The results of a scientific poll in Hawaii showed 68 \n     percent of those surveyed support the bill. The statewide \n     poll was taken Aug. 15-18 by Ward Research, a local public \n     opinion firm. The results are consistent with a 2003 poll. \n     While polls alone do not a mandate make, the consistency \n     between the two polls shows that despite the best efforts of \n     opponents such as Mr. Burgess, the multicultural, multiethnic \n     residents of Hawaii support the recognition of Native \n     Hawaiians and allowing them to take the first, tentative, \n     steps toward recognition and sovereignty.\n       More importantly, the elected officials of Hawaii have \n     almost unanimously thrown their support to the NHGRA. The \n     NHGRA is supported by most of the elected officials of \n     Hawai`i, including the entire Hawai`i Congressional \n     Delegation, Governor Linda Lingle, the Senate and House of \n     the State Legislature (except two members), all 9 Trustees of \n     the Office of Hawaiian Affairs and the mayors of all four \n     counties of Hawai`i.\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       The NHGRA is about justice. It is about righting a wrong. \n     It is about recognition of the identity and sovereignty of a \n     people who survived attempts by our government to strip them \n     of these precious rights over a hundred years ago. Far from \n     the racial balkanization spread by its opponents, NHGRA is \n     simply a step--a baby step at that--towards potential limited \n     sovereignty and self-governance.\n       Most who live in Hawai`i know the distinct Native Hawaiian \n     community, with its own language and culture, is the heart \n     and breath of Hawai`i. Hawai`i, and no other place on earth, \n     is the homeland of Native Hawaiians.\n       On one thing the proponents and opponents of NHGRA seem to \n     agree: Hawai`i is a special place in these United States, a \n     multicultural society and model for racial and ethnic harmony \n     that is unlike anywhere else in our country and, \n     increasingly, the world. It is also a place where its \n     multicultural residents recognize the indigenous Native \n     Hawaiian culture as the host culture with a special \n     indigenous political status where there are state holidays \n     acknowledging Native Hawaiian monarchs, and the Hawaiian \n     language is officially recognized.\n       Perhaps it is the ``mainlanders'' lack of context and \n     experience that creates a debate where, in Hawai`i, there is \n     practically none. In the mainland, we think of ``Aloha'' as \n     Hawaii Five-O, surfing, and brightly colored shirts that \n     remain tucked away in the back of our closets. In Hawai`i, \n     however, Aloha and the Aloha spirit is more than just a \n     slogan. It is proof positive of the influence and power of \n     the Native Hawaiian people and culture that exists and \n     thrives today. In my lifetime, I have seen growing awareness, \n     acceptance and usage of Hawaiian culture, symbols, and \n     language. It is now almost mandatory to use pronunciation \n     symbols whenever Hawaiian words are printed, whereas twenty \n     years ago it was ignored. Multiculturalism in modern Hawai`i \n     means that non-Native Hawaiians respect and honor the \n     traditions of a people who settles on these volcanic \n     paradises after braving thousands of miles of open ocean. The \n     least we can do, the ``we'' being the American government \n     which took away their islands, is to accord them the basic \n     respect, recognition, and privileges we do all indigenous \n     peoples of our nation. NHGRA will give meaning to the Apology \n     Resolution; it will begin the healing of wounds.\n       That same aloha spirit that imbues the multicultural \n     islands of Hawai`i will, in my opinion, ensure that the \n     processes contained in NHGRA will inure to the benefit of all \n     the people of Hawaii. Perhaps more than any other place in \n     our Union, fears of racial polarization, discrimination, or \n     unequal treatment resulting from the passage of NHGRA should \n     be seen as distant as the stars which the Hawaiians used to \n     navigate their wa'a, their canoes, across the vastness of the \n     seas.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Asian \nPacific American Heritage Month. It is a time to recognize the \nimmeasurable contributions in service, commerce, and cultural diversity \nmade by Americans of Asian and Pacific Islander descent who continue to \nstrengthen our great Nation's character and influence.\n  I believe that the United States draws its strength from a proud \nhistory of immigration.\n  The Asian Pacific American community is an essential part of that \ntradition and it boasts an extremely vibrant and diverse population.\n  Places such as Chinatown, Korea Town, Little Tokyo, Little Saigon, \nand Filipino Town only enhance the richness of the American urban \nlandscape.\n  Today, more than 14 million Asian Pacific Americans live in the \nUnited States.\n  I am proud to come from the State that has the highest population of \nAsian Pacific Americans, nearly 5 million.\n  In particular, Los Angeles County is home to the country's single \nlargest Asian community, with 1.4 million individuals.\n  California owes a great deal to the tradition of Asian Pacific \nAmericans who have made their home in the Golden State since the 1800s.\n  To help honor that legacy, last year, Congress authorized the Angel \nIsland Immigration Station Restoration and Preservation Act. Known as \nthe ``Ellis Island of the West,'' over 1 million immigrants, including \n175,000 Chinese immigrants, passed through its gateways to establish \nnew lives on the west coast. Now, this location can continue to provide \nus with a vital link to our Nation's history and culture.\n  Let me take a moment to pay tribute to the visionaries who helped to \ncreate the Asian Pacific Heritage Month: Secretary of Transportation \nNorman Mineta; U.S. Senator Daniel Inouye; Former U.S. Senator Spark \nMasunaga; and Former Congressman Frank Horton.\n  Thanks to the leadership of these fine individuals, a joint \nresolution established Asian Pacific American Heritage Week in 1978, \ninitially designating the first 10 days of May as the annual time of \nrecognition. That was later expanded to a month-long celebration in \n1992.\n  The month of May holds special significance for the Asian Pacific \nAmerican community. It coincides with two important milestones: The \narrival in the United States of the first Japanese immigrants on May 7, \n1843; and the completion of the transcontinental railroad on May 10, \n1869 thanks in large part to the contributions of thousands of Chinese \nworkers. This year, the theme chosen to represent this year's Heritage \nMonth is ``Dreams and Challenges of Asian Pacific Americans.'' It is \ndesigned to recognize the struggle of Asian Americans and Pacific \nIslanders who continue to stand firm against adversity in the pursuit \nof the American dream.\n  Sadly, the Asian Pacific American community understands all too well \nthis struggle.\n  Their story has been entangled with several dark chapters of \nAmerica's history.\n  It began in the 1800s, when people of Asian Pacific ancestry were \nprohibited from owning property, voting, testifying in court, or \nattending school.\n  This story of persecution regrettably continued throughout much of \nthe 19th and 20th centuries: the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which \nprohibited the immigration of Chinese to the United States; a 1913 \nCalifornia law, which prohibited immigrant aliens from owning land; the \nrepatriation of Filipino immigrants in 1935; and the mandatory \ninternment of Japanese Americans during World War II. This particular \nstory remains a blight on the conscience of this great Nation.\n  Nevertheless, the Asian Pacific American community found a way to \nendure and persevere over these injustices and indignities.\n  In so doing, they to create a tradition of triumph over adversity \nthat personifies the best of this Nation's character.\n  But our Nation cannot afford to overlook their sacrifice and \nstruggle.\n  For this reason, I am proud that in the 109th Congress, Tule Lake--\nthe largest internment camp of the 10 that existed--was designated as a \nNational Historic Landmark. This will help future generations \nacknowledge and understand the painful legacy of the Japanese Americans \nwho endured the shame of the forced internment camps used during the \nbleak days of World War II.\n  I would also like to take a moment to commend the 300,000 Asian \nPacific American veterans who established the practice of military \nservice for the thousands of Asian Pacific American men and women \ncurrently serving in our Armed Forces.\n  One such individual is my distinguished colleague, U.S. Senator \nDaniel Inouye of Hawaii.\n  Even though his loyalties to our Nation and that of many other \nJapanese Americans--were falsely and wrongly questioned during World \nWar II, Senator Inouye proudly participated in our Nation's most highly \ndecorated unit, the Army's 442nd ``Go for Broke'' regiment combat team.\n  Since then, Senator Inouye has continued to serve this country as a \ndevoted public servant and exemplary citizen.\n  His story of boldness and aspiration is not unique. Throughout the \ndecades, countless numbers of Asian Pacific Americans have worked \ntirelessly to build better lives for themselves and their families.\n  But although many Asian Americans have achieved success, we cannot \nforget the hardships of the Southeast Asian and Pacific Islander \ncommunities that were forced out of their homelands and who are now \nstruggling to prosper here in America.\n  According to the 2000 Census, Southeast Asian Americans have the \nlowest percentage of education, with most possessing less than a high \nschool education. They also have the lowest proficiency of English and \none of the highest rates of receiving public assistance.\n  We cannot allow these individuals to be ignored or overlooked. I will \ndo everything I can to help this community prosper.\n  In closing, as we reflect on many individual stories of achievement \nand success during this month of May, we are steadily inspired by the \nstandards Asian Pacific Americans set in our schools, in the business \nworld, and our neighborhoods. I am confident that their dynamic \ninitiative and entrepreneurship will only continue to inspire us to \ngreatness in the years to come.\n\n[[Page S5217]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/25/senate-section/article/S5216-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5216-S5217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           IN HONOR OF ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Mr. President, today for the second week in a row the \nSenate Judiciary Committee's agenda included a proposed amendment to \nthe Constitution, to its fundamental purpose and to our rights as \nAmericans. I understand that Republicans are trying to keep to a \npolitical timetable for raising divisive matters in the runup to the \nNovember elections.\n  I know that in election years they love to wave the flag amendment, \nrather than work on veterans health care or protecting veterans' \nprivacy. We have just witnessed the largest theft of private \ninformation from the Government ever, the loss of information on more \nthan 26 million American veterans. Compounding the incompetence was the \nmisguided decision by the Veterans' Administration for secrecy in \ntrying to cover this up for the last 3 weeks. This follows on the heels \nof last year's debacle of a billion-dollar shortfall in VA's budget for \nveterans health care, after repeated denials. It all adds up to a \n``heckuva bad job'' for America's veterans.\n  The President should call Secretary Nicholson into the woodshed for a \nserious shakeup in how the VA is run. In the meantime, Secretary \nNicholson needs to answer why this information was left vulnerable to \nsuch a breach, why such a delay in notification was allowed to occur, \nand what specific steps he is taking to ensure such a breach does not \nhappen again. The Nation's veterans--who have been willing to make the \nultimate sacrifice for their country--deserve to have the best tools \navailable to protect themselves and their families from identity theft.\n  Rather than work on our privacy and identity theft legislation, \nincluding the Specter-Leahy Personal Data Privacy and Security Act of \n2005, or the Kerry-Salazar legislation to provide credit checks and \nmonitoring to those veterans whose private information was compromised, \nwe are being directed to another divisive debate on a proposed \nconstitutional amendment.\n  In that regard, I noticed that earlier this week, the White House \nPress Secretary was asked about this constitutional amendment and had \nno knowledge of it existing. I would like to include that exchange in \nthe Record:\n\n       Question. [C]ould you tell us if the President also \n     supports the proposed amendment to protect the United States \n     flag from public desecration?\n       Mr. Snow. Do we have a flag desecration--I apologize; this \n     is something that, believe it or not, in the last two weeks \n     has not come up. So I'm afraid----\n       Question. Flag burning.\n       Mr. Snow [continuing]. Flag burning. I'll just have to get \n     back [to you].\n\n  The White House Press Secretary has yet to become familiar with the \ntalking points on how much more important this is than national \nsecurity, the war in Iraq, unprecedented gas prices, the lack of a \nFederal budget, the penalties on seniors who may now wish to sign up \nfor Medicare drug prescription, comprehensive immigration reform, \nemergency supplemental appropriations, preparations for the hurricane \nseason, preparations for a possible avian flu pandemic, privacy \nlegislation, and completing our work on reauthorizing the Voting Rights \nAct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/25/senate-section/article/S5217-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        FEDERAL HOUSING ENTERPRISE REGULATORY REFORM ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this week Fannie Mae's regulator reported \nthat the company's quarterly reports of profit growth over the past few \nyears were ``illusions deliberately and systematically created'' by the \ncompany's senior management, which resulted in a $10.6 billion \naccounting scandal.\n  The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight's report goes on \nto say that Fannie Mae employees deliberately and intentionally \nmanipulated financial reports to hit earnings targets in order to \ntrigger bonuses for senior executives. In the case of Franklin Raines, \nFannie Mae's former chief executive officer, OFHEO's report shows that \nover half of Mr. Raines' compensation for the 6 years through 2003 was \ndirectly tied to meeting earnings targets. The report of financial \nmisconduct at Fannie Mae echoes the deeply troubling $5 billion profit \nrestatement at Freddie Mac.\n  The OFHEO report also states that Fannie Mae used its political power \nto lobby Congress in an effort to interfere with the regulator's \nexamination of the company's accounting problems. This report comes \nsome weeks after Freddie Mac paid a record $3.8 million fine in a \nsettlement with the Federal Election Commission and restated lobbying \ndisclosure reports from 2004 to 2005. These are entities that have \ndemonstrated over and over again that they are deeply in need of \nreform.\n  For years I have been concerned about the regulatory structure that \ngoverns Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac--known as Government-sponsored \nentities or GSEs--and the sheer magnitude of these companies and the \nrole they play in the housing market. OFHEO's report this week does \nnothing to ease these concerns. In fact, the report does quite the \ncontrary. OFHEO's report solidifies my view that the GSEs need to be \nreformed without delay.\n  I join as a cosponsor of the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory \nReform Act of 2005, S. 190, to underscore my support for quick passage \nof GSE regulatory reform legislation. If Congress does not act, \nAmerican taxpayers will continue to be exposed to the enormous risk \nthat Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pose to the housing market, the overall \nfinancial system, and the economy as a whole.\n  I urge my colleagues to support swift action on this GSE reform \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/25/senate-section/article/S5217-3", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5217-S5218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO GEORGIA'S 48TH BRIGADE COMBAT TEAM\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, it is my honor and privilege today to \npay tribute to the Georgia National Guard's 48th Brigade Combat Team. \nThe 48th Brigade is an integral part of Georgia's widely respected \nNational Guard and is comprised of more than 4,000 of Georgia's 9,000 \nguardsmen. The Georgia National Guard is the thirteenth largest in the \nNation, with nearly 60 percent of its forces classified as ``high \npriority units'' which would be among the first to deploy during a \nnational crisis.\n  The 48th Brigade has a long and proud history. The 48th was \noriginally organized on April 23rd, 1825, in Macon, and served in some \ncapacity during the Civil War, WWII, the Gulf War, and the Iraq War. \nThe unit was mobilized into Federal service on November 30th, 1990 at \nFort Stewart in order to participate in Desert storm.\n  During Desert Storm, the 48th Brigade successfully completed intense \ncombat training at the Army's National Training Center at Fort Irwin, \nCA. Upon completion of this training, the 48th received the \ndistinguished honor of being the first and only National Guard combat \nunit deemed combat-ready for the Gulf War. Later in 2001, the 48th was \ndeployed to Bosnia-Herzegovina for a period of 8 months. This \ndeployment established Georgia's 48th as one of the first National \nGuard units of its size to assume such a large multinational \npeacekeeping mission.\n  The 48th Brigade recently joined the 3rd Infantry Division in Iraq, \nmaking it the first unit to utilize the Army's new concept of \nintegrating reserve units with active units in order to form a highly \neffective and efficient active-reserve team. The 48th Brigade was \nmobilized under the Presidential Selective Reserve Call Up in October \n2004 and in January 2005, under the leadership of Brigadier General \nStewart Rodeheaver, the 48th was ready to serve our country in Iraq. As \na ``Combat Ready'' force, the 48th was deployed to Iraq on May 22nd, \n2005, after undergoing brief training in Kuwait. On June 14, 2005, the \n48th Brigade officially took over its assigned area of responsibility \nin southern Baghdad. They were responsible for conducting full-spectrum \ncounter-insurgency operations in an attempt to defeat anti-Iraqi \ninsurgents. The 48th also played in important role in developing the \nnewly formed Iraqi Security Forces.\n  During their deployment to Iraq, Georgia's 48th Brigade was known for \nits bravery, effectiveness, and commitment to getting the job done. \nDuring a 12 month deployment, the 48th Brigade completed numerous \nmissions and was responsible for offensive and defensive victories \nthroughout Iraq. The Brigade was involved in a multitude of operations \nconducted over nearly 1,900 square kilometers throughout southern \nBaghdad. These missions were in conjunction with 5 larger U.S. \noperations\n\n[[Page S5218]]\n\nincluding: Operation Safe Skies, Operation Warning Track, Operation \nPatriot's Call, Operation Dragon's Fire, and Operation Thunder. In \ntotal, the 48th Brigade conducted 12,647 combat patrols, 792 cordon and \nsearch missions, established 6,219 traffic control points, and \nconducted 3,782 convoy security missions.\n  The soldiers of the 48th captured and detained over 500 Anti-Iraqi \ninsurgents, trained over 2,460 Iraqi Soldiers, and established two \nIraqi forward operating bases in Sunni-dominated areas of Iraq. The \nBrigade introduced more than 11 million dollars' worth of new and vital \nessential services as well as set the conditions to create over 621 new \njobs in southern Baghdad. One of the most historical highlights was the \nBrigade's ability to work with the International Elections Commission \nof Iraq to establish 22 polling sites across Iraq. Due to the 48th's \ninvolvement, nearly 63,000 Iraqi citizens were able to vote on their \nnew Constitution during the ``first ever'' Iraqi national elections.\n  On October 2005, the 48th Brigade officially took over security \noperations for the Logistics Support Area, LSA, Anaconda base. LSA \nAnaconda is the largest operating base in Iraq and is located in the \nnorth-central Iraq province of Salah al Din. The 48th Brigade was \nsimultaneously responsible for convoy security escort missions near \nCamp Adder, Iraq--located in the southern province of Nasiriyah. The \n48th's ability to successfully complete these two missions located in \ntwo different areas of the country was instrumental to the success of \nall Multi-National Forces operating in Iraq. The 48th Brigade Combat \nTeam successfully conducted operations throughout an area of over 1,192 \nmiles while conducting 1,500 patrols and successfully securing the \nlargest military operations base in Iraq.\n  It is my great honor to commend the 48th Brigade and welcome them \nhome as honorable Soldiers who served our country courageously. The \nlast of the 4,200 members of the 48th Brigade arrived back in Georgia \non May 11th, 2006. Following their return, they out-processed at Fort \nStewart and were released from active duty to return to their hometowns \nthroughout the State of Georgia. While we welcome the 48th Brigade back \nfrom their mission, we need to also honor the 26 soldiers who made the \nultimate sacrifice. My heart goes out to the families of these \nsoldiers. They are true heroes and our Nation will be forever in debt \nto their sacrifice.\n  I know I speak on behalf of our Nation, the State of Georgia, and the \nAmerican people when I thank the 48th Brigade for living up to the \ncalling of our National Guard ``Citizen Soldiers'' and making everyone \nin Georgia, and in America, extremely proud and grateful for their \ncontribution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/25/senate-section/article/S5218-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING IGNACY JAN PADEREWSKI\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am honored to have joined my \ncolleagues Senator Hagel, Senator Durbin and Senator Murkowski to \nsubmit S. Res. 491 commemorating the 65th anniversary of Ignacy Jan \nPaderewski's death on June 29, 1941 and recognizing his accomplishments \nas a musician, composer, statesman, and philanthropist.\n  I.J. Paderewski was a brilliant pianist who played hundreds of \nconcerts in the United States and Europe. Paderewski always gave back \nto his society. As a pianist Paderewski donated a bulk of the proceeds \nfrom his concerts to charitable causes and helped establish the \nAmerican Legion's Orphans and Veterans Fund.\n  When he decided to enter into politics, Paderewski continued to work \nfor the betterment of society. He worked hard to bring independence to \nPoland, served his country as the first Premier of Poland during World \nWar I and fought against the Nazi dictatorship in WWII.\n  During his time in politics one of Paderewski's main goals was to \nbuild a strong relationship between Poland and the United States. This \nis why it is so fitting that this resolution acknowledges Poland as an \nally a strong partner in the war against global terrorism. The strong \nrelationship that exists today is due in part to the foundations laid \nby I.J. Paderewski.\n  Ignacy Jan Paderewski's contributions to music, democracy, and \nhumanity--as a renown pianist, composer, humanitarian and great Polish \nstatesman--make him one of the most deeply valued and appreciated \nfigures in the Polish American community. His close and friendly \nrelationship with his contemporary U.S. social, cultural and political \nleaders, including many U.S. Presidents, made him a real friend of the \nAmerican people. That is why it is an exciting opportunity for me, an \nAmerican of Polish heritage to honor Ignacy Jan Paderewski by \nacknowledging his work, his accomplishments and all that he contributed \nto the world with this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/25/senate-section/article/S5218-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5218-S5219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL PUBLIC WORKS WEEK\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, as chairman and on behalf of my colleagues \non the Environment and Public Works Committee, I would like to \nrecognize the dedicated public works professionals, engineers, and \nadministrators who represent State and local governments throughout the \nUnited States and was pleased to introduce S. Res. 475 proclaiming the \nweek of May 21-May 27, 2006, as National Public Works Week.\n  As we celebrate the contributions of the tens of thousands of men and \nwomen in America who provide and maintain the infrastructure and \nservices that Americans rely on every day, let us not forget these same \npeople are our first responders too. More often than not, they are on \nthe scene before police, fire, and medical personnel. They can be found \nclearing roads, restoring water and power as well as critical \ninfrastructure lifelines following disasters. Only in the absence of \nthese dutiful public servants, would we truly recognize how valuable \ntheir tireless efforts are in providing and maintaining the basic \ninfrastructure that many Americans often take for granted.\n  America's public infrastructure is the lifeblood of every community. \nIt includes the roads, bridges, public transportation and airports, the \ndrinking water and wastewater treatment systems, the solid waste \nservices and facilities and other important utilities essential to our \nquality of life. These structures and services help sustain community \nlife, safeguard the environment, protect our health, support our \neconomy and allow people and goods to move safely and efficiently. \nThese structures and services are truly public goods.\n  Because of my work on the most recent transportation law, SAFETEA-LU, \nPublic Law 109-59, I have a better appreciation of just how important a \nreliable, well maintained and fully functioning network of interstate \nhighways and transportation infrastructure is to the Nation. America's \ntransportation system is one of the world's most expensive, with more \nthan 3.9 million miles of roads, 5,300 public-use airports, 26,000 \nmiles of navigable waterways, and more than 173,000 route-miles \nserviced by buses and rail in urban areas.\n  Transportation-related goods and services contribute more than $1.3 \ntrillion to U.S. gross domestic product, about 11 percent of the total.\n  Furthermore, every $1 billion invested in roads and bridges generates \napproximately 47,500 jobs. Not only are infrastructure investments of \nthe most fundamental and important functions of government, but they \nare also financially wise.\n  The Nation's 54,000 community drinking water systems supply drinking \nwater to more than 250 million Americans, and municipal wastewater \ntreatment systems each year prevent billions of tons of pollutants from \nreaching our rivers, lakes, stream, and coastlines. By keeping water \nsupplies free of contaminants, these water utilities protect human \nhealth and preserve the environment. Additionally, our water \ninfrastructure supports a $50 billion a year water-based recreation \nindustry, at least $300 billion a year in coastal tourism, a $45 \nbillion annual commercial fishing and shell fishing industry, and \nhundreds of billions of dollars a year in basic manufacturing which \nrely on clean water.\n  Clearly, public works professionals play a vital role in protecting \nthe environment, improving public health and safety, contributing to \neconomic vitality and enhancing the quality of life of every community \nof the United States.\n\n[[Page S5219]]\n\nI am delighted to use this National Public Works Week to thank them for \ntheir diligent and continued service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/25/senate-section/article/S5219-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               NAMING OF THE JACK C. MONTGOMERY HOSPITAL\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I am proud as we approach this Memorial \nDay that we will have occasion to celebrate the renaming of the \nDepartment of Veterans Administration Hospital in Muskogee, OK, after a \ntrue American hero--Congressional Medal of Honor winner, and Cherokee, \nJack C. Montgomery.\n  I would first like to thank a fellow member of the Oklahoma \ncongressional delegation, Congressman Dan Boren of Oklahoma's 2nd \nDistrict, for his diligent work in bringing this important matter to a \nsuccessful conclusion. This legislation has been cosponsored by the \nrest of the Oklahoma delegation and also has garnered the strong \nsupport of Oklahoma's major veterans' service organizations.\n  H.R. 3829 pays tribute to the heroism of Mr. Montgomery, who was \nawarded the highest honor bestowed by our Nation upon a member of the \narmed services for his courageous actions on February 22, 1944, during \nthe Italian campaign of the Second World War. On this date, \nMontgomery's platoon had sustained intense fire near Padiglione, Italy, \nfrom three echelons of enemy forces, at which point Montgomery \ndisplayed a singular act of courage by attacking all three positions \nhimself and taking prisoners in the process. After witnessing this \ntremendous display of courage, Montgomery's men rallied and defeated \nthe enemy.\n  In addition to being only one of five Native Americans to be awarded \nthe Medal of Honor, Lieutenant Montgomery was also awarded the Silver \nStar, the Bronze Star, and the Purple Heart with an Oak Leaf Cluster. \nUpon his release from the U.S. Army, Montgomery continued his service \nto our Nation by beginning work with the Veterans Administration in \nMuskogee where he remained for most of his life.\n  Mr. Montgomery is survived by his wife Joyce, and I am hopeful the \nPresident can sign this bill into law in swift fashion.\n  In conclusion, as we do pause this Memorial Day to remember those who \nsacrificed so that we may remain free, I can think of no veteran more \nworthy of our gratitude than Jack C. Montgomery.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/25/senate-section/article/S5219-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5219-S5220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ADDITIONAL STATMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       KENYON COLLEGE GRADUATION\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this month I was lucky to have the \nchance to address the 178th graduating class of Kenyon College in \nGambier, OH.\n  I wanted to introduce my remarks into the Congressional Record \nbecause it was such an honor to be there to share in this graduation \nceremony.\n  In Gambier I met some of the most passionate, dedicated, involved \nyoung Americans out there, and I know that as graduates they will go \nfrom being student activists to citizen activists.\n  In advance of my speech, I also had the chance to meet in my office \nwith many recent Kenyon alumni who shared a deep pride and genuine \nexcitement about the role Kenyon plays in their lives even to this day. \nI was lucky to spend this time with young people--Democrats, \nRepublicans, and Independents--who affirm anyone's faith in the \nvibrancy of our democracy and the young people who will shape its \nfuture. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my remarks be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The remarks follow.\n\n       Class of 2006--fellow survivors of November 2, 2004. I'm \n     happy to be here at this beautiful school, which had my \n     admiration long before that night when the country wondered \n     whether I would win--and whether you would vote.\n       Your website has a profile of a very smart math major in \n     the class of 2006. Joe Neilson. He said that once, after a \n     statistics course here, he realized ``the probability of any \n     event in our lives is about zero.'' ``I probably spent a \n     week,'' Joe said, ``annoying my friends by saying: `What are \n     the odds?' '' Well Joe, what were the odds that we'd be \n     linked by those long hours--not that I keep track--560 days \n     ago? Like everyone that night, I admired the tenacity of \n     Kenyon students. But what you did went far beyond tenacity.\n       My wife, Teresa, is honored by the degree you grant her, \n     today. But she's also here to honor you because when you grow \n     up in a dictatorship as she did, when you don't get a chance \n     to vote until you're thirty-one, when you see your father \n     voting for the first time in his seventies, you know what a \n     privilege it is to cast a ballot.\n       Through that long night, we in Massachusetts watched you in \n     Gambier. We were honored. We were inspired. We were \n     determined not to concede until our team had checked every \n     possibility. If you could stay up all night to vote, we could \n     certainly stay up that next day to make sure your vote would \n     count. In the end, we couldn't close the gap. We would have \n     given anything to have fulfilled your hopes.\n       And I also thank those who cast a ballot for my opponent. I \n     wish all Republicans had been just like you at Kenyon--\n     informed, willing to stand up for your views--and only 10 \n     percent of the vote. Actually, all of you, through your \n     patience and good humor showed Americans that politics \n     matters to young people. And so I really do thank every \n     student here.\n       I especially want to thank someone who isn't a student. \n     Because at the meeting Hayes was kind enough to mention--and \n     I did take notes--the alums made it clear how much they'd \n     been influenced by great friends, great teachers. Or a great \n     coach.\n       I know what it's like to be on a team before an important \n     game. I know how crucial that last practice can be. For the \n     field hockey team, that November 2nd was the last day before \n     the Oberlin game. Winning meant getting into the league \n     championship--and from there to the NCAAs. So I can \n     understand why players were upset after hours waiting in line \n     at the polling place that afternoon. When Maggie Hill called \n     her coach to ask if she should come back to practice--you'd \n     expect the coach to say ``you better believe it.''\n       This coach had a different reaction. ``I'll cancel \n     practice,'' she said, ``and I'm sending the whole team to \n     vote.'' In that one moment she became a hero to me, and an \n     example to many. It takes a special coach to know there are \n     more important things than a big game. We should all express \n     our gratitude to Robin Cash. Her values are the values of \n     Kenyon.\n       By the way, for parents who may not remember--Kenyon played \n     brilliantly--and won that Oberlin game 3-zip.\n       Now, it's not as if seeing brilliance here at Kenyon is a \n     surprise. Like everybody, I know that when you look at a \n     resume and see a Kenyon degree, you think, ``Smart. \n     Committed. Good writer.'' And maybe, ``Likes to see a lot of \n     stars at night.''\n       But there's more. The Kenyon alums I met with were so \n     eloquent about what it meant to be here, where all your \n     friends live, study, and play along a one mile path in a town \n     surrounded by cornfields. One said, ``I came here on a cold, \n     rainy October, but after my interview I saw professors having \n     coffee at the deli, and heard everybody so excited about the \n     Tom Stoppard play they were putting on--I fell in love with \n     the place.'' Someone else said, ``Intelligent conversation \n     permeates the whole campus.'' Another said--and I don't think \n     he was kidding--``Nobody gets drunk at Commencement.''\n       We talked until I got dragged into an intelligence briefing \n     from the White House. Believe me, I learned more at the \n     Kenyon meeting.\n       What they said sounded very familiar. And important. \n     Because there are other places where you can find a small \n     community--where the bonds you forge will never dissolve. You \n     can find it on a tiny boat in the rivers of Vietnam's Mekong \n     Delta. You can even find it in the Senate--sometimes.\n       Someone described to me what it's like walking into Gund \n     for dinner after your girl friend breaks up with you. You see \n     every single person staring to make sure you're all right. I \n     thought, ``Sounds like walking into the Democratic Caucus \n     after that first New Hampshire poll.''\n       The fact is, the Kenyon grads in Washington didn't agree on \n     everything. But they agreed that Kenyon is a place where you \n     have the luxury of examining an idea not for whether it \n     sounds good but for whether it is good.\n       Actually, one Kenyon parent told me something that bothered \n     him. His son took Quest for Justice his first semester here. \n     That's not what bothered him. But, the class met early in the \n     morning, and his son made every class. After years of pushing \n     his kid to get out of bed, the father wanted to know, ``What \n     changed?'' His son said, ``Dad, I could disappoint you. But \n     not Professor Baumann.''\n       And that brings up one of the things I want to talk about. \n     For the Election Day event that united us was a \n     disappointment. There's no way around it. Even as we flew in \n     over Columbus this morning, I was looking down at the Ohio \n     landscape, thinking: we came so close. So what. You cannot go \n     through life without disappointment. No team, no politician, \n     no writer, no scientist--no one avoids defeat.\n       The question is: what do you do next?\n       It's simple: you pick yourself up and keep on fighting. \n     Losing a battle doesn't mean you've lost the war. Whether \n     it's a term paper, an experiment or a race for President, you \n     will learn from experience, and experience breeds success.\n       That's important, because frankly there are so many things \n     to fight for. By that, I don't just mean the things we fight \n     over in the halls of Congress. Kenyon produces graduates that \n     produce our literature and drama--like E.L. Doctorow did with \n     The March, 54 years after leaving Gambier. Or\n\n[[Page S5220]]\n\n     Allison Janney did on West Wing--the first show ever to \n     portray politics with something approaching the complexity it \n     deserves. Your challenge is to produce and perform the rich \n     imaginative works that move and illuminate your time.\n       Kenyon has vastly expanded its science programs. And your \n     challenge is to fight in laboratories against enemies like \n     the tiny HIV virus that has created the most devastating \n     epidemic in human history--killing more people every two \n     hours than there are in this graduating class.\n       At a time when we read about the high-tech jobs of a \n     globalized world, your challenge is to find a way to educate \n     the millions of Americans who can't get those jobs because \n     they can't read well enough to understand how to get online.\n       And now, we are engaged in a misguided war. Like the war of \n     my generation, it began with an official deception. It's a \n     war that in addition to the human cost--the tragedy of tens \n     of thousands of Iraqis and Americans dead and wounded--will \n     cost a trillion dollars. Enough to endow 10,000 Kenyons. \n     Money that could fight poverty, disease, and hunger. And so, \n     your challenge is also to find a way to reclaim America's \n     conscience. I have no doubt you will.\n       For one thing you have great role models. Like your \n     parents, sitting out there under the trees. You may laugh \n     looking at the old photos of your dad in a ponytail, and your \n     mom in bellbottoms and that crazy, tie-dyed shirt. But their \n     generation too faced the task of ending a war. And they did.\n       And went on to invent Earth Day, march against racism, \n     bring women into the workplace and become the first \n     generation to usher in an acceptance for all people \n     regardless of race, religion, gender or sexuality.\n       They honored democracy by making government face issues of \n     conscience--and I ask you to applaud them for making the \n     world better BEFORE they made it better by making you what \n     you are!\n       And of course, in addition to those sitting behind you--you \n     have great role models sitting among you. Students from this \n     class who had a dream, took a chance, and have already \n     achieved great things.\n       I know, because sitting here is a student who dreamed of \n     being published, and felt ambitious enough to send a poem \n     he'd written for class to the Chatauqua Literary Journal. And \n     so Sam Anderson became a published poet at the age of 21.\n       I know, because sitting here is a student who, watched a \n     cousin struggle with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, dreamed of \n     finding a way to help--and designed a project that involved \n     her with the leading DMD researcher in the world. Now Amy \n     Aloe's been invited to work in his ground-breaking lab.\n       I know, because sitting here is a student who dreamed of \n     returning to the country of her birth, the country that \n     shaped a part of my life. And in Vietnam, Nhu Truong could \n     examine not just issues, but the more difficult job of \n     examining herself.\n       They all took a chance. If you ever despair of making a \n     difference you'll have Kenyon people to remind you of what's \n     possible if you take that chance.\n       And not just from the class of '06.\n       One of the alums mentioned that every week, a group of them \n     meet to talk about issues. They don't think alike about every \n     idea, he said. But they share a passion for ideas they \n     learned here. Another asked me to tell those of you \n     suspicious of government, that ``it's made up of a lot of \n     people like us, trying to make things better.''\n       The group included one alum who's well known here--and \n     getting well known in Washington. But a while back he was \n     just a nervous 24-year old, sitting silently in a meeting \n     with a new Secretary of State. Until he got up the nerve to \n     raise his hand and make a point. ``Who's that young, red-\n     haired kid?'' Condoleeza Rice said afterward, to an aide. \n     ``Keep your eye on him.'' No, she didn't mean he was a \n     security risk. He'd said something that, as a Washington \n     Post reporter put it, ``crystallized her thoughts about \n     foreign policy.'' And now Chris Brose, Kenyon 2002, \n     travels everywhere with Secretary Rice, not just crafting \n     her speeches but talking about policy. I wish the policies \n     were a little different, but he's making a mark. He's \n     making a difference.\n       You know, during World War II, my father was flying planes \n     in the Army Air Corps. While he was away on duty, my mother \n     was volunteering to care for the sick and wounded. She sent \n     him a letter about it. ``You have no idea of the ways in \n     which one can be useful right now,'' she wrote. ``There's \n     something for everyone to do.'' She was right about her time. \n     And what she wrote is right about yours too.\n       In a few minutes you will walk across this stage for your \n     diploma. You'll line up on the steps of Rosse Hall to sing \n     for the last time. You'll turn in your hoods, go back and \n     finish packing. Maybe sell that ratty sofa to somebody from \n     the class of 2007. And then you'll watch the cars pull away.\n       I know you've heard too many times the old saying that \n     commencement is not an end but a beginning. The truth is, \n     it's both. It is a day to feel sad about leaving Gambier. \n     It's a day to feel eager about what lies ahead.\n       Because you have a special mission. Those who worked to end \n     a war long ago, now ask you to help end a war today. Those \n     who worked to end poverty ask you to finish what we have left \n     undone. We ask you to take a chance. We ask you to work for \n     change. Promise yourselves, promise your parents, promise \n     your teachers that you will use what you have learned. Don't \n     doubt for an instant that you can. Only doubt those \n     pessimists who say you can't. For all along the way, I \n     promise, that while you leave the campus, Kenyon will never \n     leave you.\n       You will be linked by the experiences vividly brought to \n     life today by Hayes Wong, who experienced them with you.\n       As you fight for justice in this world, you will be linked \n     by the insights you all had in courses like Quest for \n     Justice. You will be linked to classmates whose success you \n     predict will take the world by storm--and to some whose \n     success takes you by surprise. You will be linked by the \n     times you sat on a bench in Middle Path and argued about \n     politics with people whose views you opposed--and learned you \n     could disagree and still be friends. At some point you'll see \n     that this small campus that changed you has already produced \n     enormous change in the world.\n       But much more is urgently needed.\n       Remember that the bedrock of America's greatest advances--\n     the foundation of all we take for granted today--was formed \n     not by cheering on things as they were, but by taking them on \n     and demanding change. No wonder Thomas Jefferson himself said \n     that ``dissent is the highest form of patriotism.''\n       So if you're not satisfied with the dialogue today, if you \n     feel your issues are being ignored, speak out, act out, and \n     make your issues the voting issues of our nation.\n       You might say, ``who's he kidding? We can't do that.'' \n     Well, I remember when you couldn't even mention environmental \n     issues without a snicker. But then in the '70s people got \n     tired of seeing the Cuyahoga River catch on fire from all the \n     pollution. So one day millions of Americans marched. \n     Politicians had no choice but to take notice. Twelve \n     Congressmen were dubbed the Dirty Dozen, and soon after seven \n     were kicked out of office. The floodgates were opened. We got \n     The Clean Air Act, The Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking \n     Water. We created the EPA. The quality of life improved \n     because concerned citizens made their issues matter in \n     elections.\n       So it's up to you now to take up the challenge of your \n     times if you want to restore a politics of big ideas, not \n     small-minded attacks.\n       Make no mistake--you'll meet resistance. You'll find plenty \n     of people who think you should just keep your mouths shut or \n     that by speaking out you're somehow less than patriotic. But \n     that's not really new either. When we protested the war in \n     Vietnam some would weigh in against us saying: ``My country \n     right or wrong.'' Our response was simple: ``Yes, my country \n     right or wrong. When right, keep it right and when wrong, \n     make it right.''\n       Graduates of the Class of 2006, you know how to make it \n     right--and you will see that it came from what you learned \n     here: from a class so compelling you were awake at the crack \n     of dawn to learn . . . from that night Teresa and I will \n     never forget when you waited patiently till 4:15 at a polling \n     place in Gambier . . . or from a coach who knew that her \n     mission was to teach you how to win on and off the field.\n       Congratulations--and God Bless.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/25/senate-section/article/S5220-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5220-S5222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HONORING THE COMMITMENT OF PUBLIC SERVICE\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, earlier this month I had the honor \nof joining Linda Springer, the director of the Office of Personnel \nManagement, and John E. Potter, the Postmaster General of the United \nStates, at a breakfast to kick off the four-day celebration on the \nNational Mall celebrating Public Service Recognition Week. The annual \nMall event is part of the yearly, week-long observance to celebrate and \nrecognize public employees sponsored by the Public Employees Roundtable \nat the Council for Excellence in Government. While Director Springer \nand I gave brief remarks to the distinguished guests at the breakfast \nhosted by GEICO, I was extremely impressed by the words of the \nPostmaster General who gave the keynote address. I want my colleagues \nto have the opportunity to read Mr. Potter's words, which so eloquently \nexplain why the millions of public servants at all levels of government \nshould be recognized for the work they do daily on our behalf.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the address of Mr. Potter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The address follows.\n\n  Keynote Address--Postmaster General/CEO John E. Potter, May 4, 2006\n\n       Thank you, Chairman Harper, President McGinnis and our \n     special guest, Director Springer.\n       I'd also like to take a moment to recognize and thank Tony \n     Nicely, Chairman of GEICO, the sponsor of today's event.\n       Tony recently wrote about the efforts of Louisiana GEICO \n     employees to serve their customers in the aftermath of \n     Hurricane Katrina. The local claims office was flooded and \n     many employees lost everything. But they showed up at work to \n     process claims and get those checks to policyholders as \n     quickly as possible--through the mail, of course!\n       I know exactly what Tony has experienced. I was in New \n     Orleans the week after the\n\n[[Page S5221]]\n\n     storm and again, last month. If I learned nothing else, I \n     learned about the frailty of the things we build. In the span \n     of a few hours, Katrina broke open levees and brought down \n     entire neighborhoods. Its winds dropped houses on highways \n     and tossed ships on shore.\n       In the days and months since, we have seen repeatedly the \n     one thing that could not be conquered by even this \n     unprecedented storm--the human spirit.\n       One of the postal employees I talked with told me that the \n     members of his extended family lost eight homes in and around \n     New Orleans.\n       Yet, like him, hundreds of our people were back at work \n     almost immediately. Within days of the storm, they set up \n     temporary locations to get social security checks into the \n     hands of thousands of local residents. Where they could, our \n     carriers were back on the streets delivering mail. I know our \n     customers appreciated their efforts to bring normalcy back to \n     a very difficult situation.\n       So, let me welcome all of you and let me congratulate the \n     millions of employees from every federal agency, the \n     military, every state, every county, every city, every \n     village--and volunteers everywhere throughout America.\n       Wherever you are, you serve your communities and your \n     nation in so many ways. Public Service Recognition Week \n     celebrates each and every one of you. It's an honor you've \n     earned through outstanding efforts--and I salute you.\n       When I was asked to join you here, I didn't know that the \n     Postal Service would be at the center of the news. By now, \n     I'm sure you've heard that the Postal Service plans to adjust \n     rates next spring.\n       Why? Well, our charter requires us to operate like a \n     business--and to break even. But the Postal Service doesn't \n     receive any tax money to pay for its operations--and we \n     haven't for 25 years. When you boil it down, the American \n     people pay for the operation of the world's largest and most \n     efficient mail delivery system every time they buy a stamp.\n       Like each of you, and like every business and government \n     agency in America, the Postal Service is not immune to rising \n     costs. And given our size those costs can really add up. Each \n     year, our 700,000 employees deliver 212 billion pieces of \n     mail to 145 million homes and businesses--and that's growing \n     by about 2 million new addresses every year.\n       They work from more than 37,000 Post Offices and drive more \n     than 260,000 vehicles while delivering the mail. Every time \n     the price of gas goes up just a penny, our costs go up $8 \n     million a year. And the price of gas has doubled since 2002, \n     the last time we changed rates to offset growing operational \n     costs. You can do the math.\n       Our people have a big job and they're doing it better than \n     ever. Through their efforts, service and customer \n     satisfaction have reached record levels. They've helped us \n     improve efficiency six years running--and this year, we're \n     expecting a seventh.\n       And by the time the price of a First-Class stamp goes up--\n     one year from now--the average increase for that five year \n     period will be exactly one penny a year--and be below the \n     rate of inflation.\n       As I said, the Postal Service is required to operate like a \n     business. And we're not alone. Across the board, all \n     government agencies are working to become more business-like. \n     There's a drive for efficiency. There's a drive for keeping \n     costs down. There's a drive for measurable results. There's a \n     drive to provide continuously improving service.\n       And that puts us all on the horns of a dilemma.\n       That's something I thought about when I had a conversation \n     with Bill Russell a few years ago. Most of you remember Bill \n     as the cornerstone of the Boston Celtics back in the 60's. He \n     was an incredible shot blocker who revolutionized defense in \n     the NBA.\n       Bill is still active, although he's traded in his jersey \n     with the big number 6 on it for a suit and tie. He's very \n     involved in mentoring--helping children develop basic skills \n     so they can turn their dreams into reality.\n       Bill joined us at a dedication for a stamp we issued to \n     honor and encourage mentoring. When I was talking to Bill, he \n     had a question for me.\n       ``Jack, you're part of the government, but there's a lot of \n     business in what you do, right?''\n       ``That's right,'' I told him.\n       Then he asked me, ``What kind of government do we have?''\n       I paid attention in school, so I was pretty confident when \n     I said that we're a democracy.\n       But the quiz wasn't over yet. ``What does that mean?'' he \n     asked.\n       ``It means one person, one vote, equal rights for \n     everybody, and we elect fellow citizens to represent us.''\n       Then Bill told me that our government has evolved over \n     time. It's a function of compromise--everyone comes to the \n     table with their own interests.\n       So, at the end of the day, as a government entity, your \n     mission is a dual mission. It's not just to deliver service. \n     It's really much broader than that. It's about compromise. \n     It's about change. It's about focus on mission. But it's \n     about carrying out that mission with a very different \n     perspective than others might bring to it.\n       There's an important message there. As Postmaster General, \n     I have to stay focused on numbers--on-time delivery, cost per \n     delivery, customer satisfaction, productivity, and, of \n     course, making money or losing money. That's something \n     everyone in government has to focus on, too.\n       That's the business end of things. But, as Postmaster \n     General, I can never forget that my job is about more than \n     just numbers. As a government agency, we can never operate \n     like a pure business--and we shouldn't. There's a social \n     aspect to everything we do.\n       We provide a useful and needed service--from the biggest \n     cities to the smallest towns. We keep people in touch. We \n     keep them connected. And we have to make sure we treat \n     everyone equally. After all, our government doesn't belong to \n     us, it belongs to everybody, no matter who they are, no \n     matter where they are, no matter what their circumstances. \n     So, when we make decisions, we have to keep that in mind.\n       Yes, we have to manage our budgets. Yes, we have to \n     consider things like return on investment. Yes, we have to \n     make our departments and our agencies more efficient than \n     ever. Yes, we have a lot of scrutiny. And, yes, we answer to \n     a lot of bosses--in my case, 280 million of them--and one \n     boss who can really tell me how I'm doing--my wife Maureen.\n       But we can never forget one thing. Behind every program we \n     propose or implement, there are people. There are families. \n     There are businesses--large and small--providing jobs and \n     opportunity for those families.\n       Each of them is relying on their government for the \n     services that make so much else possible. And those services \n     don't always lend themselves to a pure profit and loss \n     statement. That's why government is different. And that's at \n     the heart of public service.\n       When you choose a career in public service, there are \n     tradeoffs. You'll never make the Forbes list of America's \n     billionaires--unless you hit the Powerball a few times. And \n     if you're like me, you've probably got a ticket in your \n     pocket! You'll never get to exercise a stock option as part \n     of your benefit program. And that corporate jet? Well, I've \n     always found that the Metro is pretty reliable.\n       But the satisfaction is priceless. How does it feel to give \n     a child a head start by teaching her to read her first \n     sentence? How do you put a price on the joy of the family \n     whose idea you helped turn into a business? How do you \n     measure the lives saved by the research grant that helped \n     someone find a cure for a terrible disease? And how can you \n     not be moved by the smile of a grandmother when she receives \n     a birthday card from her first grandchild--whether she's in \n     the next town, in a village in the Alaskan bush, or halfway \n     across the ocean in Hawaii?\n       You do all of this, and more. As public employees, you have \n     a tremendous responsibility. You have a tremendous record of \n     performance. You represent the very best in public service. \n     You--and everyone in public service--should be proud.\n       And at the Postal Service, that's something we think about \n     every day. We have to. That's because we're the one \n     government service that makes a personal visit to just about \n     everyone in the nation, just about every day. For many \n     Americans, we're the daily face of their government.\n       So, when they're judging us, they're also judging their \n     government and, to a certain extent, they're judging you. \n     Believe me, that's a powerful motivator for the Postal \n     Service. We don't want to let you down--and we won't.\n       We're all about service--and it will stay that way. Service \n     is part of our DNA. It's what we do. It's who we are. I'm \n     proud to say that our people have remained focused on service \n     and brought it to record levels. And that's been reflected in \n     customer satisfaction ratings that are the envy of just about \n     any organization.\n       Our history has been about service. We've helped build a \n     great nation and bring its people together. We've been an \n     important part of new business development--something we \n     still do today.\n       Think about eBay, think about Netflix, think about Amazon. \n     They're all smart, modern, internet-based companies that have \n     become powerful economic engines that rely on the mail.\n       But, as I said, what we do--what we all do--is about more \n     than just a simple business equation. I think of that every \n     day when I hear about quiet heroes, like Mike Miller, a \n     letter carrier from a suburb of New Orleans.\n       Mike rode out Hurricane Katrina in his houseboat. After the \n     storm, he saw total destruction everywhere. With a friend, \n     Mike took his inflatable, motorized boat and responded to \n     cries of help for four straight days, ferrying hundreds of \n     people from rooftops to higher ground.\n       In one case, Mike stopped when he thought he heard sounds \n     coming from a house that was almost completely submerged. \n     With no way in, he pulled his boat to the roof, yanked off a \n     vent pipe and yelled down. He heard a faint response and, \n     with his friend, frantically pulled off roof tiles, cut \n     through the beams, and dropped into the attic.\n       Groping through the darkness, heat and water, he discovered \n     an elderly woman, barely alive. They lifted her through the \n     opening in the roof and brought her to safety. Looking back, \n     Mike said, ``I was just doing what had to be done.''\n       To Mike Miller, and to so many others like him, I say, \n     ``Thank you!''\n       When I think about people like Mike, and every one of our \n     employees who bring their best to the job every day, I know \n     we can meet just about any challenge that comes our way. And \n     Mike's not alone. There are\n\n[[Page S5222]]\n\n     people like him all across the government. People serving \n     people. People willing to do what it takes--and then some.\n       In closing, let me recognize the men and women of the \n     Postal Service, and every government employee, from the \n     smallest villages, to the largest cities; from every county, \n     every state and every federal agency.\n       You make our nation and your community a better place with \n     all that you do. You have earned the recognition you are \n     receiving this week. I salute you and I am honored to be one \n     of you.\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/25/senate-section/article/S5222-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONGRATULATING THE WINNERS OF THE NEW HAMPSHIRE EXCELLENCE IN EDUCATION \n                                 AWARDS\n\n Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \n2006 recipients of the New Hampshire Excellence in Education Awards. \nThese prestigious awards, commonly called the EDies, are presented each \nyear to individuals and schools who demonstrate the highest level of \nexcellence in education.\n  The recipients of the EDies are chosen based on certain criteria, \nincluding student achievement, leadership, and decisionmaking; \ncommunity and parental involvement; school climate, curriculum, and \ninstruction; and the teaching and learning process. I am proud to \nrecognize the 34 individuals, 3 schools, 1 department, and 1 school \nboard who will receive this distinctive honor on June 10, 2006.\n  The EDies awarded in various categories, including school board, \nprincipal, and superintendent of the year, as well as schools of \nexcellence at the elementary, middle, and high school levels. In \naddition, individuals are recognized for their contributions in \nspecific subject areas, such as social studies, music, and business \neducation. There is also an award in memory of New Hampshire's own \nChrista McAuliffe, whom we lost 20 years ago as she courageously \nembarked on her journey to be the first teacher in space.\n  As an elected official, parent, and former student of the New \nHampshire public school system, I have had the opportunity to meet and \nlearn from many educators across the Granite State, including some of \nthis year's award recipients. Their dedication to providing students \nwith the tools they need to become productive and engaged citizens is \ncommendable and the basis for the superior achievement of New \nHampshire's schools. I am personally grateful to the teachers at every \nlevel of my own education who provided me with the guidance necessary \nto succeed.\n  The EDies provide us with an opportunity to acknowledge the \ntremendous contributions of our State's educational community. I am \npleased to recognize them here today and to convey the gratitude of my \nState for the role each of this year's recipients have played in the \nlives of New Hampshire's children.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the list of the 2006 New Hampshire \nExcellence in Education Award winners and school finalists be printed \nin the Record.\n  The list follows.\n\n\n      2006 New Hampshire Excellence in Education Award Recipients\n\n       Rebecca Albert, Deborah Boisvert, Norma J.

TAYLOR\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and pay \ntribute to Thomas W. Taylor, the Senior Deputy General Counsel of the \nArmy, for his exceptionally meritorious service to our country. Mr. \nTaylor will retire on June 3, 2006, having completed 36 years of superb \nmilitary and Federal civilian service with the Department of the Army, \nthe last 19 of which have been as a member of the Senior Executive \nService. As such, he has been at the forefront of the most critical \nissues affecting our Nation and the military today. His commitment to \nupholding the rule of law in the service of the national defense has \nbeen the bedrock grounding many of the Army's mission successes. We owe \nhim a particular debt of gratitude for the genuine and enduring concern \nhe has demonstrated for the welfare of our men and women in uniform and \ntheir families, particularly in the face of the many sacrifices our \nNation has demanded of them over the last decades.\n  Mr. Taylor's remarkable career as a selfless and committed servant of \nthe public trust culminated in his appointment in 1997 as Senior Deputy \nGeneral Counsel, the Department's senior career civilian attorney. Mr. \nTaylor has long been the foundation of strategic leadership, vision, \nand continuity for the Army legal community. Over the course of his \ndistinguished career, he has provided sage policy and legal advice to \nsix Secretaries of the Army, seven Army General Counsel, and numerous \nother senior officers in the Army Secretariat, and Headquarters, \nDepartment of the Army, on a wide variety of operational issues, \nincluding military support to civilian authorities: during special \nevents of national significance, such as the Olympic Games and \nPresidential Inaugurals; in responding to domestic disasters and civil \ndisturbances; and in fighting drugs and weapons of mass destruction. \nHis personnel law portfolio covered the full range of military and \ncivilian personnel law: mobilization, recruitment, promotions, \ndischarges, medical care issues, sexual harassment, and equal \nemployment opportunity. Other practice areas included select aspects of \ncriminal law, implementation of the Goldwater-Nichols Department of \nDefense Reorganization Act as applied to the Army, Secretarial and \ncommand authority, and application of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, \nas well as policies governing the release of information under the \nFreedom of Information and Privacy Acts in response to public, \nCongressional, and media requests for information about Army activities \nand investigations. Further, Mr. Taylor discharged the Department's \nlegal responsibility for intelligence oversight, monitoring Army \nintelligence and counterintelligence operations worldwide and \noverseeing legal and policy aspects of special access programs and \nintelligence support to other Federal agencies. In 2001, he was the \nsenior Army lawyer at the Pentagon site on September 11, providing \nadvice enabling immediate on-scene military support to security and \nrecovery operations. He has represented the Army and DoD in matters \nwith Congress and other Federal agencies, as well as to foreign \ncountries. Beginning in the Reagan administration and during extended \ntransitional periods between successive administration appointees, Mr. \nTaylor often has been selected personally by Secretaries of the Army to \ndischarge the duties of the General Counsel. Most recently, he has \nserved in that capacity since July of 2005.\n  Mr. Taylor was raised in Pilot Mountain, NC, and is a graduate of \npublic schools in North Carolina. He earned a B.A. in history with high \nhonors from Guilford College, Greensboro, NC, in 1966, and a J.D. with \nhonors in 1969 from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, \nwhere he was inducted into the Order of the Coif and a staff member of \nthe law review, which published three of his notes. After graduating \nfrom law school, he was commissioned as a Captain in the Judge Advocate \nGeneral's Corps of the Army. He first served at Fort Wainwright, AK, \nfollowed by tours at Fulda and Darmstadt, Germany. Returning to the \nUnited States, Mr. Taylor taught from 1975 to 1978 in the law \ndepartment of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, serving as \nprofessor to many of the Army's future leaders. Later, after tours of \nduty in the office of the Judge Advocate General in the Pentagon and in \na nominative position as an Assistant to the Army General Counsel, he\n\n[[Page S5223]]\n\nleft active duty to accept a civilian position with the office in 1982. \nIn 1987 he graduated from the Industrial College of the Armed Forces. \nThroughout his years of civilian service, he continued to serve as an \nindividual mobilization augmentee in the reserve component of the Army \nJudge Advocate General's Corps, retiring in 2000 in the grade of \nColonel, having last served as the Director of the Academic Department \nof The Judge Advocate General's School.\n  In his 26 years of selfless and dedicated Federal civil service, Mr. \nTaylor has received numerous honors and awards, including, on three \noccasions, the Army's Decoration for Exceptional Civilian Service. He \nreceived the Presidential Rank Award as a Distinguished Executive in \n1996 and as a Meritorious Executive in 1993 and 2002. Notably, he has \nreceived honorary awards for lifetime contributions to his client \ncommunities including: the Knowlton Award for Excellence in \nIntelligence, presented by the Military Intelligence Corps; the Chief \nof Public Affairs Award for outstanding support and advice to the Chief \nof Public Affairs; designation as a distinguished member of The Judge \nAdvocate General's Corps Regiment; and induction into the Order of the \nMarechaussee for service to the Military Police Corps Regiment.\n  On leaving Federal service, Mr. Taylor will become a professor of the \nPractice of Public Policy Studies at Duke University. I know that he \nwill continue to inspire others with his sense of honor, his love of \nthe law, and his abiding belief in the nobility of public service and \nvalues for which our Nation stands. I join with all my colleagues in \nsaluting Thomas W. Taylor and his wife Susan for their many years of \noutstanding service to the U.S. Army and to our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/25/senate-section/article/S5223-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               100TH ANNIVERSARY OF HARVEY, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD.

A mother, wife, sister, activist, trailblazer, and \ntrusted friend, Mary will be missed by the countless people whose lives \nshe touched before her time on this Earth was cut short.\n  Mary graduated from Wellesley College and the Boston University \nSchool of Law, and almost immediately began a rapid ascent that took \nher to the pinnacle of the legal field. Through her hard work and keen \ninstincts, she quickly made herself known across Delaware as one of the \nhardest working and brightest female attorneys in the State's history. \nShe dedicated 8 years to the DuPont Company before becoming the first \nfemale partner at Potter Anderson & Corroon LLP, where she was beloved \nby clients and coworkers alike.\n  But perhaps the most indelible image of Mary is that of a \nphilanthropist with an enormous heart. She never shied away from the \nopportunity to help others, and devoted countless hours to numerous \ncharitable organizations throughout the State, volunteering, serving on \nboards, and giving every ounce of her being to the people who needed it \nthe most.\n  She was a founding member and past chair of the Advisory Committee of \nthe Fund for Women of the Delaware Community Foundation. She also \nserved as an enthusiastic member of the Delaware Bar Foundation and a \nhelpful supporter of the Democratic Party within Delaware. Her absence \nwill be sorely felt by all who knew her, but the vast reach of her acts \nof charity and kindness will continue to touch people's lives for years \nto come.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with Mary's family, her husband William, \nand daughters Mary (Lucy) and Ellen. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/25/senate-section/article/S5223-3", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                100TH ANNIVERSARY OF PEKIN, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD.

A bill to establish a bipartisan commission on insurance \nreform; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe text of these four bills, the Commission on Catastrophic Disaster \nRisk and Insurance Act of 2006, the Catastrophe Savings Accounts Act of \n2006, the Policyholder Disaster Protection Act of 2006, and the \nHomeowners Protection Act of 2006, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bills was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3114\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Commission on Catastrophic \n     Disaster Risk and Insurance Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, which struck the \n     United States in 2005, caused over $200 billion in total \n     economic losses, including insured and uninsured losses.\n       (2) Although private sector insurance is currently \n     available to spread some catastrophe-related losses \n     throughout the Nation and internationally, most experts \n     believe there will be significant insurance and reinsurance \n     shortages, resulting in dramatic rate increases for consumers \n     and businesses, and the unavailability of catastrophe \n     insurance.\n       (3) The Federal Government has provided and will continue \n     to provide billions of dollars and resources to pay for \n     losses from catastrophes, including hurricanes, volcanic \n     eruptions, tsunamis, tornados, and other disasters, at huge \n     costs to American taxpayers.\n       (4) The Federal Government has a critical interest in \n     ensuring appropriate and fiscally responsible risk management \n     of catastrophes. Mortgages require reliable property \n     insurance, and the unavailability of reliable property \n     insurance would make most real estate transactions \n     impossible. In addition, the public health, safety, and \n     welfare demand that structures damaged or destroyed in a \n     catastrophe be reconstructed as soon as possible. Therefore, \n     the inability of the private sector insurance and reinsurance \n     markets to maintain sufficient capacity to enable Americans \n     to obtain property insurance coverage in the private sector \n     endangers the national economy and the public health, safety, \n     and welfare.\n       (5) Multiple proposals have been introduced in the United \n     States Congress over the past decade to address catastrophic \n     risk insurance, including the creation of a national \n     catastrophic reinsurance fund and the revision of the Federal \n     tax code to allow insurers to use tax-deferred catastrophe \n     funds, yet Congress has failed to act on any of these \n     proposals.\n       (6) To the extent the United States faces high risks from \n     catastrophe exposure, essential technical information on \n     financial structures and innovations in the catastrophe \n     insurance market is needed.\n       (7) The most efficient and effective approach to assessing \n     the catastrophe insurance problem in the public policy \n     context is to establish a bipartisan commission of experts to \n     study the management of catastrophic disaster risk, and to \n     require such commission to timely report its recommendations \n     to Congress so that Congress can quickly craft a solution to \n     protect the American people.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n       There is established a bipartisan Commission on \n     Catastrophic Disaster Risk and Insurance (in this Act \n     referred to as the ``Commission'').\n\n     SEC. 4.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated $5,000,000 to carry \n     out the purposes of this Act.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, one of the most frequent complaints I \nhave been hearing from people in Louisiana whose homes sustained damage \nin Katrina and Rita has been about their property insurance. First, it \ntook insurance companies a long time to get adjusters into the area \nafter the storm and many people are still waiting for claim payments. \nThis was followed by the shock for many of our homeowners that their \nproperty insurance policies covered wind damage, but not flood damage. \nThey could get the roof replaced, but the rest of the house was lost. \nMany of them were not required to have flood insurance because they \neither did not live in a flood plain or did not have a mortgage. And \nnow we are beginning to discover that many insurance companies are no \nlonger writing policies in Louisiana.\n  Our homeowners weathered one, and in some cases two, hurricanes \nalready. However, now it's as if our homeowners have been hit by \nanother hurricane--one causing a flood of red ink, lost homes, ruined \nlives, and broken communities.\n  I hope we never see another storm like Katrina. I would not want any \nof my colleagues' states to face the one-two punch of two hurricanes \nthe way Louisiana was. But hurricane season is coming again, starting \nnext week on June 1. These insurance issues and problems are going to \ncome again. We can rebuild levees and use the lessons of Katrina to \nbetter prepare for these storms, but finding a solution to this \ninsurance issue is much harder.\n  First of all, insurance is regulated at the State level. We do not \ncontrol it up here. In all fairness, property casualty insurance \ncompanies do not cover flood damage because that is covered by the \nNational Flood Insurance Program at FEMA. But the potential for \nflooding from hurricanes still remains and our insurance system is not \nready to handle the amount of uninsured damage a massive storm like \nKatrina.\n  I am pleased to join my colleague from Florida, Senator Nelson, as a \ncosponsor of the Commission on Catastrophic Disaster Risk and Insurance \nAct of 2006. This bill will not produce major changes in the insurance \nindustry overnight, but it will begin to take a look at this issue to \nidentify the best solution to ensuring that home and business owners \nwill have insurance coverage to help them rebuild after catastrophic \nnatural disasters.\n  The commission established by this legislation will take the first \nsteps for assessing the casualty insurance market and recommend any \nnecessary legislative changes to ensure that consumers will have \nreadily available and affordable insurance coverage to protect them \nfrom natural disasters. Experts from a wide variety of fields in \ndisaster preparedness, construction engineering, the insurance \nindustry, and government will serve on the commission. While the \nmembers will be chosen on a bipartisan basis, they will be taking a \nnonpartisan approach to this subject.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. It is a first \nstep--a modest step--toward ensuring the financial security of \nAmericans in the face of catastrophic disasters.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida:\n  S. 3115.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the creation of disaster protection funds by property and casualty \ninsurance companies for the payment of policyholders' claims arising \nfrom future catastrophic events; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                                S. 3116\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Policyholder Disaster \n     Protection Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Rising costs resulting from natural disasters are \n     placing an increasing strain on the ability of property and \n     casualty insurance companies to assure payment of homeowners' \n     claims and other insurance claims arising from major natural \n     disasters now and in the future.\n       (2) Present tax laws do not provide adequate incentives to \n     assure that natural disaster insurance is provided or, where \n     such insurance is provided, that funds are available for \n     payment of insurance claims in the event of future \n     catastrophic losses from major natural disasters, as present \n     law requires an insurer wishing to accumulate surplus assets \n     for this purpose to do so entirely from its after-tax \n     retained earnings.\n       (3) Revising the tax laws applicable to the property and \n     casualty insurance industry to permit carefully controlled \n     accumulation of pretax dollars in separate reserve funds \n     devoted solely to the payment of claims arising from future \n     major natural disasters will provide incentives for property \n     and casualty insurers to make natural disaster insurance \n     available, will give greater protection to the Nation's \n     homeowners, small businesses, and other insurance consumers, \n     and will help assure the future financial health of the \n     Nation's insurance system as a whole.\n       (4) Implementing these changes will reduce the possibility \n     that a significant portion of the private insurance system \n     would fail in the wake of a major natural disaster and that \n     governmental entities would be required to step in to provide \n     relief at taxpayer expense.\n\n     SEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n\n[[Page S5238]]\n\n       (1) America needs to take steps to be better prepared for \n     and better protected from catastrophes;\n       (2) the hurricane seasons of 2004 and 2005 are startling \n     reminders of both the human and economic devastation that \n     hurricanes, flooding, and other natural disasters can cause;\n       (3) if a repeat of the deadly 1900 Galveston hurricane \n     occurred again it could cause thousands of deaths and over \n     $36,000,000,000 in loss;\n       (4) if the 1906 San Francisco earthquake occurred again it \n     could cause thousands of deaths, displace millions of \n     residents, destroy thousands of businesses, and cause over \n     $400,000,000,000 in loss;\n       (5) if a Category 5 hurricane were to hit Miami it could \n     cause thousands of deaths and over $50,000,000,000 in loss \n     and devastate the local and national economy;\n       (6) if a repeat of the 1938 ``Long Island Express'' were to \n     occur again it could cause thousands of deaths and over \n     $30,000,000,000 in damage, and if a hurricane that strong \n     were to directly hit Manhattan it could cause over \n     $150,000,000,000 in damage and cause irreparable harm to our \n     Nation's economy;\n       (7) a more comprehensive and integrated approach to dealing \n     with catastrophes is needed;\n       (8) using history as a guide, natural catastrophes will \n     inevitably place a tremendous strain on homeowners' insurance \n     markets in many areas, will raise costs for consumers, and \n     will jeopardize the ability of many consumers to adequately \n     insure their homes and possessions;\n       (9) the lack of sufficient insurance capacity and the \n     inability of private insurers to build enough capital, in a \n     short amount of time, threatens to increase the number of \n     uninsured homeowners, which, in turn, increases the risk of \n     mortgage defaults and the strain on the Nation's banking \n     system;\n       (10) some States have exercised leadership through \n     reasonable action to ensure the continued availability and \n     affordability of homeowners' insurance for all residents;\n       (11) it is appropriate that efforts to improve insurance \n     availability be designed and implemented at the State level;\n       (12) while State insurance programs may be adequate to \n     cover losses from most natural disasters, a small percentage \n     of events is likely to exceed the financial capacity of these \n     programs and the local insurance markets;\n       (13) a limited national insurance backstop will improve the \n     effectiveness of State insurance programs and private \n     insurance markets and will increase the likelihood that \n     homeowners' insurance claims will be fully paid in the event \n     of a large natural catastrophe and that routine claims that \n     occur after a mega-catastrophe will also continue to be paid;\n       (14) it is necessary to provide a national insurance \n     backstop program that will provide more protection at an \n     overall lower cost and that will promote stability in the \n     homeowners' insurance market;\n       (15) it is the proper role of the Federal Government to \n     prepare for and protect its citizens from catastrophes and to \n     facilitate consumer protection, victim assistance, and \n     recovery, including financial recovery; and\n       (16) any Federal reinsurance program must be founded upon \n     sound actuarial principles and priced in a manner that \n     encourages the creation of State funds and maximizes the \n     buying potential of these State funds and encourages and \n     promotes prevention and mitigation, recovery and rebuilding, \n     and consumer education, and emphasizes continuous analysis \n     and improvement.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Small Business Act to improve loans for \nmembers of the Guard and Reserve, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, our country has forever prided itself on \nproviding individuals the opportunity to pursue a fair and prosperous \nexistence. Our Nation's free markets enable small business owners to \ngrow their enterprise and realize their dreams. Yet, small business \nowners and entrepreneurs are not blind to the costs of maintaining a \nfree and open society. These same small business owners and \nentrepreneurs play a vital role in protecting freedom, at home and \nabroad, as members of the U.S. National Guard and Reserve Forces.\n  In recent years, however, the Department of Defense, DOD, has placed \ngreater reliance on our nation's Guard and Reserve forces. In fact, \nsince Septeber 2001, over 550,000 Guard and Reserve members have been \ncalled up in support of current operations, at the same time, making up \nnearly one-third of deployed service members in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nIn addition, Guard and Reserve members have been charged in assisting \nwith recovery efforts in the Gulf Coast, following some of the most \ndevastating natural disasters in our country's history.\n  As these brave men and women are called to serve our Nation, the \nsmall businesses they temporarily leave behind often suffer. Many \naffected small buinesses experience slowing production and lost sales \nor incur additional expenses to compensate for an employee's absence. \nAs a result, self-employed Guard and Reserve members and small \nbusinesses that employ Guard and Reserve members are ``paying'' a \ndisproportionate and unfair share of the burden of increased call-ups. \nThis is particularly troubling, because according to the majority of \nnon-government-employed Guard and Reserve members are either self-\nemployed or work for small businesses.\n  To help stem the ill affects of Guard and Reserve call-ups on small \nbusinesses, Senator Craig and I are introducing the Patriot Loan Act of \n2006. This legislation improves the U.S. Small Business \nAdministration's Military Reservist Economic Injury Disaster Loan, \nMREIDL, program. The MREIDL program was created to provide funds to \neligible small businesses to meet ordinary and necessary operating \nexpenses that the business cannot meet, because an essential employee \nwas ``called-up'' to active duty in their role as a military reservist.\n  Specifically, our legislation would raise the maximum military \nreservist loan amount from $1,500,000 to $2,000,000. A maximum military \nreservist loan amount of $2,000,000 is the same level as many ofthe \nSBA's other loan programs, including: the 7(a) loans, international \ntrade loans, and 504 Certified Development Corporation loans that serve \na public policy goal.\n  This bill would allow the SBA Administrator, either directly or \nthrough banks to offer loans up to $25,000 without requiring collateral \nfr a loan applicant. Currently, the BA offers military reservist loans \nup to $5,000 without requiring collateral. This provision would \nincrease that level to eligible small businesses.\n  The bill would also require the Administrator to give military \nreservist loan applications priority for processing and ensure that \nGuard and Reserve members are adequately assisted with their loan \napplication by incorporating the support and expertise of SBA \nentrepreneurial development partners, such as Small Business \nDevelopment Centers.\n  Finally, the legislation requires the SBA and DOD to develop a joint \nwebsite and printed materials providing information regarding the \nMREIDL program for Guard and Reserve members, and that the SBA and DOD \njointly conduct a feasibility study on introducing business \nmobilization and interruption insurance for members of the Guard and \nReserve forces, and increased utilization of credit unions affiliated \nwith the DOD.\n  I thank Senator Craig for working with me to help address this \ncritical issue and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 3123.

A bill to establish the Department of Commerce an Under \nSecretary for United States Direct Investment, and for other purposes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce ``The United \nStates Direct Investment Act of 2006'' with my colleague from Indiana, \nSenator Lugar. This legislation is a necessary step towards making our \ncountry more competitive in encouraging multinational businesses to \nexpand or open new offices, facilities or plants in the United States \ninstead of in another country. While the United States continues to be \nthe premier place in the world to locate a business, we can no longer \nrely on our inherent advantages alone. This legislation will refocus \nthe Administrations efforts so that we do a better job of reaching out \nto businesses around the world and convince them that they should \nexpand their current operations or open new facility in the United \nStates instead of somewhere else overseas.\n  Our legislation creates the United States Direct Investment \nAdministration, USDIA, the Commerce Department to be lead by an Under \nSecretary. This new administration shall be responsible for collecting \nand analyzing data related to foreign direct investment flows. They \nshall create an annual Investment Report and an annual Direct \nInvestment Agenda to be reported and sent to Congress. They will then \nassume responsibility as the lead agency for advocating and \nimplementing strategic policies to encourage more investment in the \nUnited States from abroad. This new administration will manage an \ninvestment zone program for communities that have been negatively \nimpacted by trade but want to attract international companies to locate \nin their area. Finally, this new administration will be empowered to \ncreate ten new ``renewal communities'' as currently defined under the \nInternal Revenue Code.\n  Many countries, particularly those in Europe, have committed \nsignificant resources and energy to recruiting foreign direct \ninvestment. In many cases, they have offices in the United States where \nthey meet with U.S. companies to encourage them to consider their \ncountry for their next expansion. Right now our country does not have \nany comparable operation. We leave these efforts to our states, region \nand cities through economic development agencies and offices. Unlike \nother countries, we don't provide a Federal umbrella organization to \nhelp these people recruit more effectively. Because of their limited \nresources, this means that many of these economic development agencies \nare unable to effectively target potential businesses that might be an \nideal fit for their city or State. In some cases, these areas may be \ngoing through an economic downturn due to the closing of a plant or \nfactory making their limited resources even more scarce. This \nlegislation would give these agencies the assistance and guidance they \nneed to be more successful and effective in their recruiting efforts.\n  It is important that we focus not only on how to get businesses to \nstay in this country, but also on how we encourage overseas businesses \nto come here. In both cases, the end result is the same--more jobs for \nU.S. workers. Our first responsibility needs to be encouraging \ncompanies to stay in the United States, but we need to be cognizant of \nthe fact that we will not always be successful. If we have a robust \neffort to encourage overseas companies to move facilities to our \ncountry we will be able to neutralize any unavoidable losses. Many of \nthe pieces are already in place. We already collect much of the data \nand have an effective matrix of State, regional and local economic \ndevelopment entities.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 3171, the \nUnited States Direct Investment Act of 2006, introduced by Senator \nBingaman and myself. At a time when commerce routinely crosses national \nborders, the U.S. should be positioned to compete in all arenas. That \nmeans not only strengthening the ability of American business to invest \nand sell their products in foreign markets, but equally important, \nattracting foreign companies to the American market. Other nations \nactively recruit and provide incentives for global companies to set up \noperations and create new jobs within their borders. We must do the \nsame.\n  To this end, we propose to establish a framework within the \nDepartment of Commerce to specifically study how we can better \nencourage global companies to invest and set up businesses on our \nshores. It is essential as well, that we determine where this \ninvestment is needed. There are certain communities in the U.S. that \nare in extreme need of an infusion of economic growth and the \nopportunity to take part in the global economy. The U.S. has a talented \nand skilled workforce. We need to lead foreign companies and \nentrepreneurs to the cities and towns where they can find the resources \nthey require. If this information is readily available, and if we \nprovide incentives for companies to come, we will significantly \nincrease the amount of foreign investment coming into our country.\n  In 2005, foreign companies accounted for $129 billion worth of \ninvestments in the United States. This money translates into jobs and \nprosperity for Americans. The best way to ensure that this valuable \ninvestment is spread more widely throughout the 50 States is by \nconducting the sort of analysis proposed in this bill. We should keep \ntrack of both the quantity of investment attracted to each particular \nstate and region, and as well as the types of investment foreigners \nmake, particularly in the high technology industry. We should conduct \nan analysis of the industries that are investing in the U.S. compared \nto the industries that are going to other countries. We also need to \nassess which policies and programs have had the most success in \nattracting foreign investment.\n  It is particularly important to attract research and development and \nhigh technology industries. These have a multiplier effect that helps \nincrease the overall competitiveness of the American economy. We should \ncreate incentives for high technology companies to develop and invest \nin a U.S. presence and workforce.\n  Another key feature of the bill is consultations with local and \nregional authorities, as well as Congress. The administration should \ndetermine the needs of particular localities and what the federal \ngovernment can do to assist local efforts in attracting foreign \ninvestment. Congress should also be consulted so that information can \nbe relayed regarding regions of the country that are suffering from a \nlack of high wage jobs.\n  Global business ties are vital tools in shaping our international \nbusiness and foreign policy. Cooperation on the commercial front \nenhances our ability to work with nations on other matters, including \nsecurity and intelligence. This bill offers a positive solution to the \nconcerns over domestic job growth by seeking to ensure that \nglobalization is a two-way street with more investment traffic flowing \nin our direction.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 3175. A bill to amend title 35, United States Code, with respect \nto establishing procedures for granting authority to the Under \nSecretary for Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the \nPatent and Trademark Office to grant compulsory patent licenses for \nexporting patented pharmaceutical products to certain countries \nconsistent with international commitments made by the United States, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am today introducing a bill which can be \nthe catalyst for saving the lives or improving the health of millions \nof families in impoverished nations.\n  In far too many nations, thousands of children die needlessly each \nmonth.\n  The concept of my bill--called the Life-Saving Medicines Export Act \nof 2006--is easy to summarize.\n  It allows U.S. companies to make low-cost generic versions of \npatented medicines for export to impoverished nations that face public \nhealth crises but cannot produce those life-saving medicines for \nthemselves.\n  This bill is based on World Trade Organization agreements permitting \nnations with pharmaceutical industries to help nations in need.\n  That WTO agreement was labeled by U.S. Ambassador Portman as ``a \nlandmark achievement that we hope will help developing countries \ndevastated by HIV and AIDS and other public health crises.''\n  Apart from the pressing need for this step in humanitarian terms, \npassage of this bill could go a long way in improving U.S. relations \nwith large segments of the world's population.\n  On December 6, 2005, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative \nannounced that it ``welcomes'' efforts to ``allow countries to override \npatent rights when necessary to export life-saving drugs to developing \ncountries that face public health crises but cannot produce drugs for \nthemselves.''\n  I am concerned, however, that the administration has taken no steps \nwhatsoever to begin to implement that agreement. No implementing \nlegislation has been provided to the Hill. I was informed just today \nthat the administration has ``no present plans'' to propose legislation \nto implement that international agreement. I am disappointed with that \nanswer but am pleased that the administration expressed a willingness \nto work with me on this important effort. I will forward my bill to \nthem later today.\n  Indeed, the World Health Assembly and the World Health Organization \nhave adopted resolutions urging all WTO member nations with a generic \ncapability to adopt laws that implement that agreement.\n  The World Bank recently issued a guide and model documents on how\n\n[[Page S5246]]\n\nbest to implement that international agreement. My bill follows their \nmodel.\n  Like a generation ago, infectious and parasitic diseases remain the \nmajor killers of children in the developing world. Many of these \ndiseases--measles, malaria, river blindness--we can prevent or cure. \nBut those countries still lack the public health systems and the vital \nmedicines.\n  Every hour, more than 500 African mothers lose a child, mostly from \ndiseases caused by contaminated water.\n  In some sub-Saharan countries, HIV infection rates range as high as a \nthird of the adult population, and for this reason 35 percent of \nAfrican children are at higher risk of death than they were a decade \nago.\n  Despite these grim statistics, there is a brighter side.\n  We are far more aware today of how much our own health depends on \nwhat takes place half a world away. Whether it is AIDS, SARS, West Nile \nVirus, the Avian Flu, or some as yet unknown infectious disease, we are \nall at risk, and only an airplane flight away, from wherever the \noutbreak may occur.\n  Because of this new awareness, global health is finally recognized as \nan issue of national security. It may seem obvious today, but even ten \nyears ago it was not.\n  Health threats that once concerned only medical personnel, now \nreceive the attention of the highest levels of governments. We are \nsupporting policies and programs to help the poorest countries conduct \nbetter surveillance and respond more quickly to protect their own \npeople, and to prevent the spread of disease.\n  There is a great deal more we need to do. Today, 15 percent of the \nworld's people consume 91 percent of the world's pharmaceuticals. The \nhigh price of many life-saving medicines--medicines that we take for \ngranted in this country--is beyond reach for billions of the world's \nmost vulnerable populations.\n  President Franklin Roosevelt said: ``The test of our progress is not \nwhether we add more to the abundance of those who have much, it is \nwhether we provide enough for those who have little.''\n  Imagine if you, or a loved one, were dying and you knew the medicine \nto cure the disease exists and costs only a few dollars, but you have \nno way to get it or to pay for it. That is a reality for millions of \npeople today.\n  Reports by UNICEF, UNAIDS, and Doctors without Borders clearly show \nthat the high price of many life-saving medicines is a significant \nbarrier to their availability in many very low income areas of the \nworld. Indeed, the 4th Global Report of UNAIDS notes the extremely low \nrate of treatment for HIV/AIDS in those areas by pointing out that of \nthe 5 to 6 million urgently in need of antiretroviral medicines, only \nsome 400,000 were receiving them.\n  With respect to AIDS, a recent book by Philip Hilts called \n``Prescription for Survival'' notes the importance of offering \naffordable medicines to populations of impoverished nations:\n  ``It was said that the price of the drugs was killing tens of \nthousands . . .''\n  Under my bill, U.S. generic manufacturers would be allowed to make \ngeneric versions of patented drugs without the consent of the patent \nholders.\n  Those patent holders would receive compensation in the form of a \nroyalty payment under a so-called ``compulsory license'' and the \ngeneric companies would then be required to sell those less-expensive \ngeneric drugs only to least-developed or developing nations.\n  Use of a compulsory license occurs when Congress determines that \nthere is an important need which should be addressed.\n  For example, most Americans do not realize that their network \ntelevision programs received by satellite or by cable are provided \nunder a compulsory license. The program owners receive a royalty for \ntheir programs under a formula.\n  This way American families can watch network TV programming over \nsatellite or cable just like it is made available over-the-air. This \nsame compulsory license approach, except with respect to patented \nmedicines, is employed in this bill.\n  The WTO agreement contains language designed to protect the interests \nof the patent holders by focusing its benefits on areas of the world \nwhere these important medicines would not otherwise be available except \nfor some of the wealthiest residents.\n  Thus, implementation of the agreement would not take business away \nfrom the companies owning the patents, sometimes referred to as the \n``brand-name'' companies, since their medicines are not purchased by \nlow-income families in those impoverished nations.\n  In addition, the patent holders will receive royalties from the \ngeneric companies under the bill. Third, generic versions of products \nsold under the agreement have to be clearly marked as not for resale to \ndeveloped nations. This will mean that the bill should not result in \nundercutting the high-priced sales of those medicines by the brand-name \ncompanies in developed nations.\n  Thus, the bill addresses both the urgent needs of millions of low-\nincome families in impoverished nations while protecting the interests \nof the patent owners of these life-saving medicines.\n  There have been significant voluntary efforts made by brand-name \npharmaceutical companies, foundations, and non-profits who have donated \nlife-saving medicines and have donated time, personnel and money to \nhelp in the fight against deadly diseases in other nations. I commend \nand greatly appreciate those efforts.\n  Some funding mechanisms have been started including the Global Fund \nto Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and President Bush's Millennium \nChallenge Account. Nonetheless, much remains to be done.\n  If this bill is enacted it would complement the above efforts and \nimplement the WTO agreements and make low-cost life-saving \npharmaceutical products, and other medicines, available to hundreds of \nthousands of persons without other access to those products.\n  To provide a little history, I am very pleased that all the member \nnations of the World Trade Organization, WTO, agreed to this approach \nto assist people suffering from life-threatening diseases in least-\ndeveloped or developing nations. Under this international agreement, \nnations such as the United States with pharmaceutical industries would \nbe allowed to make and sell generic medicines to nations in need even \nif the patent owners of those medicines refused to authorize such \nmanufacture and sale.\n  As I said earlier, on December 6, 2005, the United States announced \nthat it ``welcomes'' the WTO amendment to ``allow countries to override \npatent rights when necessary to export life-saving drugs to developing \ncountries that face public health crises but cannot produce drugs for \nthemselves.'' The amendment will go in effect, for those nations which \nadopt it, once \\2/3\\ of the member nations adopt it. The current waiver \napproach, allowing nations to implement it now, will remain in place \nuntil the permanent amendment is adopted. This permits the U.S. to move \nforward with this effort this year. Indeed, Canada has already passed \nimplementing legislation.\n  Participation by any nation which wants to export such generic \nproducts is voluntary. In order to participate, each country must pass \nlegislation to implement the WTO agreement. The United States needs to \nact as soon as possible.\n  This is a moral issue. I am working with a number of religious \ngroups, humanitarian organizations, international assistance groups, \nand generic drug companies on this effort. I have also received input \nfrom some pharmaceutical brand-name companies and hope a few will step \nforward and be leaders in this effort. I will also reach out across the \naisle to try to form a bipartisan coalition.\n  Two recent World Health Organization annual reports, the World Health \nReports for 2003 and 2004, demonstrate the enormous scope of the need \nfor supplying these medicines to needy countries. The ``Life-Saving \nMedicines Export Act of 2006'' that I am introducing today would allow \nthe U.S. generic industry to respond to these urgent international \nneeds and could save millions of lives in impoverished nations.\n  Canada, Norway and the Netherlands have already enacted such \nlegislation or rule changes. However, aspects of the Canadian law have \nbeen an impediment to the willingness of generic companies to \nparticipate. For example,\n\n[[Page S5247]]\n\nthat law allows Canadian generic companies to provide such medicines \nfor at most only 4 years. The Canadian version permits dilatory and \nneedless litigation, omits important medicines from a complex list of \ncovered drugs, and creates unnecessary bureaucratic hoops.\n  I have received input from generic companies and my bill addresses \nall of those concerns. For example, it would provide that a \nparticipating generic manufacturer could provide such medicines for up \nto 14 years which makes it much more likely that U.S. generic companies \nwould make the investments needed to make low-cost medicines for export \nto impoverished areas.\n\n  Under my bill, U.S. generic manufacturers would be allowed to make \ngeneric versions of patented drugs without the consent of the patent \nholders. Those patent holders would receive compensation, a royalty \npayment, under a so-called ``compulsory license'' and the generic \ncompanies would then be required to sell those less-expensive generic \ndrugs only to least-developed or developing nations.\n  The WTO agreement contains language designed to protect the interests \nof the patent holders by focusing its provisions on areas of the world \nwhere these important medicines would not otherwise be available except \nfor some of the wealthiest residents. Thus, implementation of the \nagreement would not take business away from the companies owning the \npatents, sometimes referred to as the ``brand-name patent holders since \ntheir medicines are not purchased by low-income families in those \nimpoverished nations. There may be de minimis losses of profits for \nbrand-name patent holders but certainly the humanitarian and self-\ninterest benefits provided by the bill would massively outweigh those \nconcerns.\n  In addition, the patent holders will receive royalties from the \ngeneric companies under the bill. Third, generic versions of products \nsold under the agreement have to be clearly marked as not for resale to \ndeveloped nations. This should mean that the bill will not result in \nundercutting the high-priced sales of the patented medicines in \ndeveloped nations. Re-exporting of these generic products is prohibited \nunless it is part of a regional trade alliance among impoverished \nnations as permitted under the WTO agreements.\n  Thus, the bill addresses both the urgent needs of millions of low-\nincome families in impoverished nations while protecting the interests \nof the patent owners of these life-saving medicines and will hopefully \nhelp enhance America's image in the world.\n  For those only interested in self-interest rather than humanitarian \naid, note that because of the globalization of travel our Nation is at \nrisk from failure to contain diseases in other nations. America has a \nstrong self-interest in combating diseases in foreign nations. A \nsurprising number of new diseases have emerged in recent years. Some of \nthese new diseases are variations of existing diseases. The volume of \npeople and cargo going to and from distant nations is astounding. \nAccording to ``Rx for Survival'' by Philip Hilts, if you count only \ntravel between nations with a heavy burden of disease and those with \nless disease, more than a million people a week are making the trip.\n  The more viruses and bacteria mutant inside animals and people, and \nthe more people and goods travel throughout the world, the more \nresidents living in the United States are at risk of being harmed by \ndangerous diseases.\n  The National Intelligence Estimate of January 2000, published by the \nCIA and the National Intelligence Council noted that: ``New and \nemerging infectious diseases will pose a rising global health threat, \nand will complicate U.S. and global security over the next 20 years. \nThese diseases will endanger U.S. citizens at home and abroad, threaten \nUnited States armed forces deployed overseas and exacerbate social and \npolitical instability in key countries and regions.''\n  I hope all my colleagues will join me in supporting this effort. Here \nis my section-by-section summary of the bill.\n  Section 1: Sets forth the name of the Act as the ``Life-Saving \nMedicines Export Act of 2006.''\n  Section 2: States that the purpose of the Act is to promote public \nhealth under World Trade Organization agreements by permitting the \nexport of generic versions of life-saving patented pharmaceutical \nproducts and other medicines including diagnostic tools and vaccines \nneeded to prevent or treat potentially life threatening diseases to \nresidents of impoverished countries with insufficient or no \nmanufacturing capacity to make the medicines. The findings set forth \ndeterminations by the World Health Organization concerning the millions \nof low-income persons without regular access to medicines in lesser-\ndeveloped or developing nations.\n  Section 3: This section requires the Director of the United States \nPatent and Trademark Office to issue a compulsory license (permission \nto make and sell a patented product under this new Act) to permit \ngeneric companies to make and export medicines under the terms of WTO \ninternational agreements under several conditions.\n  The recipient country must be a least-developed nation, as defined by \nthe United Nations, or a developing nation without the ability to \nmanufacture the medicine in question.\n  The recipient country, called an ``eligible country'' in the bill, \nmust notify the WTO of its interest in participating in this program.\n  Efforts must have been made by the generic company to buy the right \nto make and sell the medicine under normal business arrangements with \nthe patent holders.\n  The medical product exported under this Act must be for life-\nthreatening public health problems and can only be used in least-\ndeveloped or developing nations, and is not for re-export except in \nidentified circumstances relating to regional trade alliances.\n  Special labeling and packaging must be used to make clear that the \nproduct is sold under the authority of the WTO agreement only for use \nas allowed under agreement and this bill.\n  The permission to make and sell the product, the license, can not \nexceed 7 years, except that the license may be extended once.\n  The holder of the compulsory license shall pay a royalty to the \npatent holder, as determined by the Director of the PTO within a \nlimited range of possible rates set forth in the bill, taking into \naccount such factors as humanitarian needs, the economic value to the \nimporting nation, and the need for low-cost pharmaceutical products by \npersons in the importing nation.\n  The maximum royalty for any shipment shall not exceed 4 percent times \nthe commercial value of the pharmaceutical products to be exported \nunder this Act under that supply agreement.\n  An alternative royalty payment approach, modeled after the approach \nenacted into law by Canada, would also be permitted with the same 4 \npercent maximum. In addition, the Director may accept combined \napplications from multiple eligible countries. Note that in emergency \nsituations the Director may waive provisions of the bill in a manner \nconsistent with the WTO agreements.\n  Section 4: This section makes clear that compulsory licenses issued \nunder this Act shall not be considered an infringement of a patent.\n  Section 5: This section creates a diverse advisory board of academic, \npatent, trade, medical, international aid, and industry experts to \nadvise the Director, and to report to the Congress, on ways to improve \nimplementation of the bill to achieve its purposes. Mandatory funding \nfor the board is provided out of the general fund of the U.S. at $1.5 \nmillion in fiscal years 2007 and 2008, with modestly declining amounts \nprovided in subsequent years through 2011.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3175\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Life-Saving Medicines Export \n     Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSES AND FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to promote public \n     health by permitting the export of life-saving pharmaceutical \n     products and other medicines manufactured in the United \n     States by compulsory license to residents of participating \n     countries with insufficient or no manufacturing capability in \n     the pharmaceutical sector for the product in\n\n[[Page S5248]]\n\n     question consistent with the General Council Decision of the \n     World Trade Organization.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The United States Trade Representative recently \n     announced that it ``welcomes'' the World Trade Organization \n     amendment to ``allow countries to override patent rights when \n     necessary to export life-saving drugs to developing countries \n     that face public health crises but cannot produce drugs for \n     themselves.''. United States Ambassador Portman called this \n     ``a landmark achievement that we hope will help developing \n     countries.''.\n       (2) Compulsory licensing of patents is a ``fixture in \n     almost all patent systems'' in the world as noted in the \n     Berkeley Technology Law Journal in 2003. By the end of the \n     1950s, for example, an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 compulsory \n     licenses were issued regarding patents in the United States. \n     (Access to Patented Medicine in Developing Countries, F.M. \n     Scherer, www.cmhealth.org/docswg4; World Health \n     Organization). Indeed, the WHO paper notes that the ``United \n     States has led the world in issuing compulsory licenses to \n     restore competition when violations of the antitrust laws \n     have been found, or in the negotiated settlement of antitrust \n     cases before full adjudication has occurred.''\n       (3) The vast majority of people living in developing \n     countries or least developed nations have limited or no \n     access to many medicines that are saving and extending lives \n     of those in other, more developed nations. Since sales of the \n     patented, brand-name versions of such medicines are minimal \n     or non-existent in many impoverished regions of the world \n     providing generic versions of those medicines under the WTO \n     General Council Decision will have minimal impact on the \n     sales of brand-name, patented versions in such regions.\n       (4) The World Health Organization has estimated that \\1/3\\ \n     of the world's population lacks regular access to essential \n     medicines, including antiretroviral drugs, and that a number \n     of essential medicines are under patent.\n       (5) Medicines and vaccines are needed throughout the world \n     to combat newly arising public health threats such as the \n     avian flu. A United States National Intelligence Estimate in \n     January 2000 notes that ``New and emerging infectious \n     diseases will pose a rising global health threat. . .''.\n       (6) Millions of people with HIV/AIDS in developing \n     countries need antiretroviral drugs. More than 40,000,000 \n     people worldwide have HIV and 95 percent of them live in \n     developing countries. Malaria, tuberculosis, and other \n     infectious diseases kill millions of people a year in \n     developing nations.\n       (7) Comprehensive reports of the World Health Organization \n     of the United Nations, in 2004 and 2005 detail the urgent \n     need for pharmaceutical products in developing countries and \n     in least developed nations.\n       (8) The World Trade Organization decisions of August 30, \n     2003, on access to generic medicines is now being considered \n     by member nations of the World Trade Organization for \n     ratification as a permanent amendment to the WTO Agreement on \n     Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to protect the privacy of veterans and spouses of \nveterans affected by the security breach at the Department of Veterans \nAffairs on May 3, 2006, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, every American has the \njustifiable expectation that the Federal Government will protect their \nprivate personal information--information that they are required to \nprovide to a Federal agencies. It is a basic and fundamental \nresponsibility of government to make sure that this sensitive data is \nhandled appropriately, accessed only by authorized personal, and used \nonly for intended purposes.\n  Earlier this week, the Veterans Administration, VA, announced that \ncomputer disks containing as many as 26.5 million veterans' personal \ninformation were stolen from an employee who had taken the information \nhome. I, along with many of my colleagues, am outraged at this enormous \nlapse in security. The Veterans Administration must make sure that \nveterans are not harmed because of the agency's failure to protect \nsensitive personal data.\n  This information includes veterans' social security numbers and dates \nof birth, the underpinnings of almost all of our financial information. \nIn the wrong hands, this information can be used to steal a person's \nidentity causing substantial harm. All of us have constituents who have \nbeen victims of identity theft. When a person's identity is stolen, it \ncan have devastating financial consequences for that person and that \nfamily. Even if the financial harm is minimal, it often takes years to \nclear your name. For our nation's veterans, many of whom are older and \ndisabled, identity theft poses even greater problems.\n  I understand that the Veterans Administration has launched an \ninternal investigation, but Congress must also conduct a thorough \ninvestigation into how this security breach occurred. I want to know \nwhy the Veterans Administration waited almost 3 weeks to inform our \nnation's veterans and Congress of this breach. In my opinion, it is \ninexcusable that veterans were not notified immediately that their \npersonal information had been stolen and were not given any guidance as \nto the steps they should take to protect themselves from identity \ntheft. I understand the Veterans Administration Inspector General has \ncited the agency for poor security policies and procedures. Congress \nmust also begin a comprehensive review of the agency's security \nprotocols and policies and force the agency to adopt stricter security \nmeasures to make sure that the personal data our veterans are required \nto provide the agency is not ever again at risk.\n  It is for this reason that I am introducing the Veterans' Privacy \nProtection Act today. Although all Federal agencies need comprehensive \ndata privacy policies, this is a targeted bill to address the security \nbreach at the Veterans Administration on an urgent basis.\n  Congress has required the Federal Trade Commission to address \nidentity theft and its consequences. The agency has taken an aggressive \napproach in combating this devastating crime. My bill would require the \nFederal Trade Commission to develop a hotline explicitly for veterans \nto provide the information, counseling, and help necessary to allow a \nveteran to protect himself from the loss of personal data.\n  At this point, our legislative response must cover all 26.5 million \nveterans that the Veterans Administration believes may have had their \npersonal information compromised. If further investigations \nconclusively prove that fewer veterans are at-risk, my bill would \ntarget services and support to the affected individuals. To help \nveterans, my bill would make it easier for them to request a long-term \ncredit alert for their records so credit agencies are aware that their \npersonal information could be being used by others. It is my \nunderstanding that a security freeze on an individual's record can have \na modest cost, and my bill would have the Veterans Administration cover \nthat cost.\n  Finally, my bill requires the General Accountability Office to \nevaluate the Veterans Administration response to this incident and to \nanalyze the agency's security protocols. I believe that an independent \ninvestigation could generate a number of recommendations to improve the \nsecurity of personal information not just in the Veterans \nAdministration but in all Federal agencies.\n  It is my great hope that a thorough investigation will find the \ncriminals responsible for the theft and determine that they were only \nafter the computer and not the millions of valuable private records of \nour veterans. If in fact these thieves were after our veterans' data, \nwe will have a major catastrophe on our hands, inexcusably adding more \nhardship to the lives of those who have so ably served their country.\n  Mr. President, today the Veterans Administration has failed our \nNation's veterans. It is inconceivable to me how any Federal agency \ncould have let this happen. We all have heard the stories during the \npast year regarding massive breaches of private and confidential data \nby private entities. The Federal Government acted quickly to respond to \nthese breaches and now it must act just as quickly if not more so to \naddress its own failings. My bill is a critical step in providing the \nnecessary assistance that millions of veterans may require, and I urge \nmy colleagues to act on it with the urgency this situation demands.\n  I ask unanimous constent that text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3176\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to suspend temporarily the duty on certain compounds \nof lanthanum phosphates; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a number of \nbills to provide for relief from duties. It is my intention that some \nor all of these duty suspension bills will eventually be included in \nthe Miscellaneous Tariff Bill, MTB, that the Senate Finance Committee \nis expected to consider this year.\n  As the members of the Senate are aware, Congress on occasion passes a \nbill, known as the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill or MTB, as a vehicle for \nenacting pending non-controversial duty suspensions. The rules for the \ninclusion of a duty suspension in the MTB are straight forward. First \nand foremost, in order to be included in the MTB, a bill must be non-\ncontroversial. A bill will be controversial if it is objected to by a \ndomestic producer of the product for which the duty reduction is being \nsought. Secondly, the cost for each bill must amount to less than \n$500,000 of lost revenue per year.\n\n[[Page S5255]]\n\n  As my colleagues are aware, the MTB provides an opportunity to \ntemporarily eliminate or reduce duties on narrowly defined products \nthat are imported into the United States because there is not available \ndomestic source for the products. These duty suspensions reduce input \ncosts for U.S. businesses and thus ultimately increase the \ncompetitiveness of their products.\n  I have been approached by a number of manufacturers in Kentucky that \nuse imported inputs while making their products. These manufacturers \nhave represented to me that, to their knowledge, there currently exists \nno American-made source for these inputs.\n  In an effort to assist these Kentucky manufacturers, I am introducing \nthese duty suspension bills so that the items they address will be able \nto be considered for inclusion in the MTB prepared by the Senate \nFinance Committee.\n  My intention in introducing these bills is to begin the process of \npublic comment and technical analysis by the International Trade \nCommission (ITC) on the items addressed by the bills. During this \nreview, the ITC will determine which of these bills are necessary and \nmeet the selection criteria. My support for a duty suspension for the \nitems is contingent on a determination by the ITC analysts that the \nitems in question are proper candidates for inclusion in the non-\ncontroversial MTB.\n  I look forward to working with Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member \nBaucus and my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee as the process \nfor assembling a final MTB package continues.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Chafee):\n  S. 3187. A bill to designate the Post Office located at 5755 Post \nRoad, East Greenwich, Rhode Island, as the ``Richard L. Cevoli Post \nOffice.''; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to one of Rhode Island's \nmost highly decorated soldiers, Commander Richard L. Cevoli of East \nGreenwich.\n  Commander Cevoli served our nation bravely in both World War II and \nthe Korean War. In honor of his sacrifices and service to his nation, I \nam introducing a bill, along with Senator Chafee, to name the post \noffice located at 5775 Post Road in East Greenwich, RI, the ``Richard \nL. Cevoli Post Office.''\n  Commander Cevoli was born in East Greenwich, Rhode Island, on October \n24, 1919, and died in a tragic plane crash in Florida on January 18, \n1955. He went to Rhode Island State College, which is now the \nUniversity of Rhode Island, and earned a degree in civil engineering. \nIn 1941, after graduation, he moved to New York and began working for \nthe engineering firm of Merritt, Chapman & Scott.\n  The month after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Richard Cevoli returned \nto Rhode Island and entered the Navy. He was sent to flight training in \nDallas, Sanford, and Pensacola before being assigned to Squadron VF-18, \nbased on the USS Intrepid in the Pacific.\n  It was during his service with the VF-18 that Commander Cevoli was \nawarded the second-highest medal awarded in the Navy--the Navy Cross. \nThis honor was given to Commander Cevoli during the Battle of Leyte \nGulf off the Philippines coast in October of 1944. Along with other \nfighters, Commander Cevoli strafed the largest Japanese ship, silencing \nmany of its guns. The following day, he severely damaged a Japanese \naircraft carrier with a 500-pound bomb. On a subsequent attack on the \nJapanese forces, as is recorded in his medal citation, ``Cevoli \ndisregarded the terrific antiaircraft opposition and scored a near miss \non a Kongo class battleship with a 500-pound bomb. Then, pulling out he \nmade a second run to strafe a destroyer, silencing its antiaircraft \nweapons and thereby contributing to our successful bombing and torpedo \nattacks which followed. His outstanding courage and determination were \nin keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval \nService.''\n  Following his service during the war, he returned to Rhode Island and \ncontinued his Navy career at Naval Air Station, Quonset Point. However, \nthe peace was short-lived. North Korea invaded South Korea, and another \nmajor conflict quickly began.\n  From 1949 until 1951, Commander Cevoli served as the Executive \nOfficer in Squadron VF-18 on board the USS Leyte, seeing action in \nKorea. In addition to the Navy Cross, Commander Cevoli earned two \nDistinguished Flying Crosses and eight Air Medals during his active \nflying career.\n  Once the conflict in Korea had ended, Commander Cevoli was able to \nspend more time at home. He took classes at the Naval War College in \nNewport and in July, 1954 he was placed in command of Squadron VF-73. \nTragically, he died serving his country when his plane crashed during a \ntraining mission.\n  Commander Cevoli left behind a wife, Grace, and three children, \nSteven, Carol, and Elizabeth. A life-long resident of East Greenwich, \nCommander Cevoli's legacy is memorialized in the Rhode Island Aviation \nHall of Fame.\n  This legislation will pay tribute to this hero of Rhode Island and \nthe United States, and I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring \nCommander Cevoli by supporting this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3187\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. RICHARD L. CEVOLI POST OFFICE.\n\n       (a) Designation.--The post office located at 5755 Post \n     Road, East Greenwich, Rhode Island, shall be known and \n     designated as the ``Richard L. Cevoli Post Office''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     post office referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to \n     be a reference to the Richard L. Cevoli Post Office.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 3188. A bill to amend the Forest Service use and occupancy permit \nprogram to restore the authority of the Secretary of Agriculture to \nutilize the special use permit fees collected by the Secretary in \nconnection with the establishment and operation of marinas in units of \nthe National Forest System derived from the public domain, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that \nwill restore authority to the Forest Service to retain marina permit \nrevenue for local expenditure.\n  Within some National Forests, the Forest Service has partnered with \nlocal small business owners, allowing them to operate houseboat \nmarinas. In exchange, the Forest Service collects occupancy fees from \nthese marina operators. A portion of these fees had, until recently, \nbeen kept in the Forest for local recreation and safety enhancement \nprojects. My legislation allows the Forest Service to once again use \nthese fees in the Forest where they were generated, and where their \nimpact will be most direct.\n  Several units of the National Forest system will benefit from this \nlegislation, but the unit most affected is the Shasta-Trinity National \nForest in California. Under the 1996 Recreation Fee Demonstration \nProgram, the Shasta-Trinity Forest developed a recreation enhancement \nprogram at Shasta and Trinity Lakes. Forest Service officials used a \nportion of the revenue from this program for projects like dock repair, \nimproved handicapped access, safety markers for boaters, law \nenforcement, and campground construction. Over $4 million was invested \nin the Forest through this program.\n  However, the program was inadvertently repealed when the Federal \nLands Recreation Enhancement Act was passed. My legislation will \ncorrect this oversight by amending the Forest Service's Special Use \nPermit program, returning this recreation and safety project authority \nto the agency.\n  Recreation on Federal lands is important to quality of life in my \nstate and throughout the nation. In many rural areas, it also provides \na boost to the economy. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation. It is a simple bill correcting an oversight in the Federal \nLands Recreation Enhancement Act. Nonetheless, it has important \nimplications both for recreation enhancement and for the local \neconomies around the affected National Forests.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S5256]]\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3188\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to allow for renegotiating of the payment schedule of \ncontracts between the Secretary of the Interior and the Redwood Valley \nCountry Water District, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Redwood \nValley County Water District Loan Renegotiation Act of 2006.\n  This legislation seeks to implement prior congressional action taken \nin 1988 to require the Secretary of the Interior to renegotiate debts \nowed by the Redwood Valley County Water District to the United States. \nIt is an absolutely essential step if the Redwood County is to obtain a \nfirm and reliable water supply.\n  In 1983, the Redwood Valley County Water District completed a project \nto supply water to a rural agricultural community near Ukiah, in \nNorthern California. Two Bureau of Reclamation loans totaling $7.3 \nmillion partially financed this project.\n  Unfortunately, the District was unable to repay these loans. This \noccurred for several reasons: The initial use projections developed by \nthe District and reviewed by the Bureau were seriously flawed; the \nDistrict's ability to raise funds was restricted when a moratorium on \nnew hook-ups was imposed; and concerns for endangered species reduced \nthe District's water allotment by 15 percent.\n  As a result of this situation, in 1998 Congress passed Section 15 of \nPublic Law 100-516 that indefinitely suspended the District's \nobligations to repay these Bureau loans and ordered the Secretary of \nInterior to renegotiate the terms of the loans. This loan renegotiation \nhas never taken place and now the District finds its water supply \nhighly uncertain. The Bureau of Reclamation acknowledged in a 2000 \nreport that the District needs a reliable water supply in order to \nsolve its current financial dilemma.\n  The District has recently identified two potential new projects, \neither of which could supply a firm and reliable source. No government \nfunds will be sought for these projects, and the District will rely on \nprivate financing, a strategy that the Bureau is encouraging. However, \nbefore the District can secure private financing for new projects, it \nmust renegotiate the existing loans to provide for their repayment \nsubsequent to repayment of the new loans.\n  This legislation requires the District to repay the United States the \ncurrently suspended loans once the new loans have been repaid. The new \nwater project will provide enough revenue to allow the District to \nrepay both its private loan and the United States government. By \nproviding a workable and reasonable solution to a longstanding problem, \nthe legislation creates a win-win solution for the Bureau of \nReclamation and the Redwood Valley County Water District.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3189\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. RENEGOTIATION OF PAYMENT SCHEDULE.\n\n       Section 15 of Public Law 100-516 (102 Stat. 2573) is \n     amended as follows:\n       (1) By amending paragraph (2) of subsection (a) to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(2) If, as of January 1, 2006, the Secretary of the \n     Interior and the Redwood Valley County Water District have \n     not renegotiated the schedule of payment, the District may \n     enter into such additional non-Federal obligations as are \n     necessary to finance procurement of dedicated water rights \n     and improvements necessary to store and convey those rights \n     to provide for the District's water needs. The renegotiated \n     schedule of payments shall commence when which additional \n     obligations have been financially satisfied by the District. \n     The date of the initial payment owed by the District to the \n     United States shall be regarded as the start of the \n     District's repayment period and the time upon which any \n     interest shall first be computed and assessed under section 5 \n     of the Small Reclamation Projects Act of 1956 (43 U.S.C. 422a \n     et seq.).''.\n       (2) By striking subsection (c).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DAYTON (for himself and Mr. Lott):\n  S. 3239. A bill to require full disclosure of insurance coverage and \nnoncoverage by insurance companies and provide for Federal Trade \nCommission enforcement; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, this legislation I am proud to cosponsor, \nalong with my distinguished colleague from Mississippi, is called the \nUniform Insurance Noncoverage Disclosure Act. I call it ``honesty is \nthe best insurance policy act.'' It says very simply that all insurance \npolicies--medical, homeowners, whatever they are--must state clearly on \nthe cover page what the policy does not cover.\n  My colleague from Mississippi can speak eloquently and powerfully \nabout his experiences in his State post-Katrina, but even before that \ndisaster occurred, I have seen similar situations in Minnesota of good \npeople whose lives were devastated by illnesses or natural disasters \nand then were further devastated by discovering that their losses or \nexpenses were not covered by their insurance policies. For years, they \nhad faithfully paid their premiums believing they had comprehensive \ncoverage, only to find out too late that was untrue.\n  Insurance companies write the policies, they interpret the policies, \nthey decide what they will and will not cover, and then they handle the \nappeals and make the final decisions. If they deny the claims, they \npocket those dollars in profits. If they honor the claims, they pay \nthem out in losses. Talk about a stacked deck in their favor and \nagainst the consumer.\n  I have had aggrieved constituents show me their homeowners policies. \nI am an intelligent, well-educated man, but it is impossible to \ndecipher them. They contain cross-references to paragraph numbers in \nother policies that are not part of the agreement. They cannot be \nunderstood, and they are not meant to be understood.\n  One Minnesota homeowner lost almost everything to a flood. Too late \nhe discovered that his blanket homeowners insurance did not cover \nlosses from a flood. He was protected, according to the policy, if an \nairplane crashed into his house or if civil insurrection--meaning a \nrevolution--caused damage to his home, but not flooding. What are the \nchances of those different events possibly occurring?\n\n[[Page S5257]]\n\n  Another Minnesota family whose father had worked for a company for \nover 20 years learned that their infant son had been born deaf and \nneeded a Cochlear implant. Two of the insurance companies that carried \nthose policies for the company covered that operation; the other did \nnot, claiming that it was experimental. The family made the unwitting \nmistake of selecting the wrong policy. No one told them that policy \nwould not pay for Cochlear implant surgery in its comprehensive family \ncoverage, and they, obviously, did not know or could not have known \nthat their unborn son would need this surgery some several years later.\n  Fortunately, this story has a happy ending. The president of the \ncompany, Honeywell, Inc., learning of this injustice, overrode the \npolicy and decreed that Honeywell, the company, would pay for that \nmissing coverage, and that child is now listening to human voices he \nnever would have had the opportunity to otherwise.\n  But not everyone is in that situation. Not everyone is that \nfortunate.\n  So this legislation, again, no costs to it, no bureaucracy, nothing. \nIt simply says that the policy must state clearly, in plain English, \nunderstandable on the cover page, what it will not cover. If it is \ncomprehensive, if it is complete, then nothing needs to be said. If it \nis not, if they experience situations that will not be covered, then it \nneeds to tell the consumer up front on that front page what they will \nbe.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my distinguished colleague from \nMississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank again my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee and \nSenator Craig for allowing us to go ahead and introduce this \nlegislation and make brief statements. It is very generous, and we \nthank him for it.\n  I am delighted to join my colleague, Senator Dayton, tonight in \ncosponsoring this legislation. He was kind enough to invite me to do so \nand even said: Why don't you be the lead sponsor? And I said no, but I \nwill be glad to cosponsor it.\n  I think this is an important statement here tonight. Honesty is the \nbest insurance policy. It has a good ring to it. It is not going to \nrevolutionize the world, but it could make a real difference. This is a \ntime when once again, in many parts of the country and particularly in \nmy home area, we are very sensitive to the threat of disasters because \nin only 8 days, on June 1, the next hurricane season will begin, and \nthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts four to \nsix major hurricanes in the upcoming season. So once again people are \nstruggling with situations of having lost their homes or having their \nhomes badly damaged and being told: No, your insurance policy didn't \ncover your damage. You didn't have flood insurance because, well, you \nweren't in a flood plain, and oh, by the way, your house was washed \naway. It wasn't blown away even though we had winds of 140 miles per \nhour with gusts of 160 or 170 miles an hour, so therefore you didn't \nhave any wind damage. I must say it has been a disappointing shock to \nme, the insensitivity and the decisions of certain insurance companies \nand the positions they have taken. Sometimes they will say: Well, wait \na minute, we told you in the policy we don't cover this, we don't cover \nthat.\n  I represent a blue-collar community. Most people work in the paper \nmills and the shipyards and are fishermen in my area. They have high \nschool educations, but they are not lawyers. They get a house insurance \npolicy and they think: I am covered. Now, go back and take a look at \nyour insurance policies. If you really take a look at it, you will find \nthat this is not covered, that is not covered, this is not covered, and \nthe next thing you know, you haven't got much coverage, but your \npremium still goes forward. The standard policies, for instance, don't \ncover earthquakes and floods, and depending on where you live, \nhurricanes may not even be covered. That is going to be determined in \nlegal actions. Sometimes they say: Well, unless the policy specifically \nsays the hurricane was covered, then it is not covered. Well, that is \nan ingenious argument, too.\n  So we have found that there are lots of problems here, and it breaks \nmy heart, what I have seen happen to thousands of my constituents and \npeople in the neighboring States of Louisiana, Texas, and Alabama. They \nare being told: No, you didn't read the small print in your policy, you \nare not covered, or because it didn't say you were covered, then you \nare not covered. That is why I have joined in sponsoring this bill. \nSurely we should have honesty in everything, including insurance \ncoverage. At least we should find a way to help the people understand.\n  So this is what this bill does. It is not all that complicated. It \nwould require that insurance companies include a noncoverage disclosure \nbox--a noncoverage disclosure box--restating in the body of the policy, \nin font twice the current size of the text, all conditions, exclusions, \nand other limitations of coverage under that policy. In other words, \nmake it clear. Don't hide it in legalese and gobbledegook. Make it \ntitle size, make it bold, where people can go and see what they are not \ngetting.\n  Some people say: Wait a minute, this may be damaging to the \ncompanies. No, I think it will help the companies. It will increase \nconsumer confidence. It will avoid disagreements or conflicts about \nwhat is covered. You will have a clarification here, and if you have \nquestions, then at least you can clear them up. It would be in their \ninterests.\n  One other criticism, and that is, what is it going to cost the \nFederal Government? Answer: Nothing. And very little to the companies. \nThey have these exclusions woven in there, but they are quite often way \ndown in the body of some long policy, incomprehensible to the minds of \nnormal and sane men and women.\n  So I think this is something which would be good. Frankly, I agree \nwith the Consumer Federation of America. This small requirement could \nhave saved many people pain and suffering and hundreds of millions of \ndollars, maybe even billions, after Katrina. So I think it is a good \nidea, and it is one I am glad to cosponsor. I hope that as we continue \nto look at what we do in the aftermath of recent disasters and how we \ndo a better job compared to future disasters, this can be worked into \nthe body of legislation. So I am delighted to join as a cosponsor. I \nthank Senator Dayton, and I thank Senator Leahy and Senator Cornyn for \nallowing us to do this.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/25/senate-section/article/S5257-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5257-S5259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 494--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n CREATION OF REFUGEE POPULATIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, NORTH AFRICA, AND \n     THE PERSIAN GULF REGION AS A RESULT OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM (for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Coleman, and Mr. \nDurbin) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 494\n\n       Whereas armed conflicts in the Middle East have created \n     refugee populations numbering in the hundreds of thousands \n     and comprised of peoples from many ethnic, religious, and \n     national backgrounds;\n       Whereas Jews and other ethnic groups have lived mostly as \n     minorities in the Middle East, North Africa, and the Persian \n     Gulf region for more than 2,500 years, more than 1,000 years \n     before the advent of Islam;\n       Whereas the United States has long voiced its concern about \n     the mistreatment of minorities and the violation of human \n     rights in the Middle East and elsewhere;\n       Whereas the United States continues to play a pivotal role \n     in seeking an end to conflict in the Middle East and \n     continues to promote a peace that will benefit all the \n     peoples of the region;\n       Whereas a comprehensive peace in the region will require \n     the resolution of all outstanding issues through bilateral \n     and multilateral negotiations involving all concerned \n     parties;\n       Whereas the United States has demonstrated interest and \n     concern about the mistreatment, violation of rights, forced \n     expulsion, and expropriation of assets of minority \n     populations in general, and in particular, former Jewish \n     refugees displaced from Arab countries, as evidenced, inter \n     alia, by--\n       (1) a Memorandum of Understanding signed by President Jimmy \n     Carter and Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan on October 4, \n     1977, which states that ``[a] solution of the problem of Arab \n     refugees and Jewish refugees will be discussed in accordance \n     with rules which should be agreed'';\n\n[[Page S5258]]\n\n       (2) a statement made by President Jimmy Carter after \n     negotiating the Camp David Accords, the Framework for Peace \n     in the Middle East, where he stated in a press conference on \n     October 27, 1977, that ``Palestinians have rights . . . \n     obviously there are Jewish refugees . . . they have the same \n     rights as others do'';\n       (3) a statement made by President Clinton in an interview \n     after Camp David II in July 2000, at which the issue of \n     Jewish refugees displaced from Arab lands was discussed, \n     where he said that ``[t]here will have to be some sort of \n     international fund set up for the refugees.

Refugees from Egypt. And there is \n     no doubt in my mind that those of those refugee who are not \n     able or not willing to avail themselves of the protection of \n     the Government of their nationality, they might have no \n     nationality or they may have lost this nationality, or, for \n     reasons of prosecution may not be willing to avail themselves \n     of this protection, fall under the mandate of the High \n     Commissioner.''

Jahn, for the United Nations High \n     Commissioner for Refugees, wrote to Daniel Lack, Legal \n     Adviser to the American Joint Distribution Committee, on July \n     6, 1967, stating, ``I refer to our recent discussion \n     concerning Jews from Middle Eastern and North African \n     countries in consequence of recent events. I am now able to \n     inform you that such persons may be considered prima facie \n     within the mandate of this Office.'' (United Nations High \n     Commissioner for Refugees Document No. 7/2/3/Libya);\n       Whereas the seminal United Nations resolution on the Arab-\n     Israeli conflict and other international initiatives refer \n     generally to the plight of ``refugees'' and do not make any \n     distinction between Palestinian and Jewish refugees, such \n     as--\n       (1) United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 of \n     November 22, 1967, which calls for a ``just settlement of the \n     refugee problem'' without distinction between Palestinian and \n     Jewish refugees, and this is evidenced by--\n       (A) a failed attempt by the United Nations delegation of \n     the Soviet Union to restrict the ``just settlement'' \n     mentioned in Resolution 242 solely to Palestinian refugees \n     (S/8236, discussed by the Security Council at its 1382nd \n     meeting on November 22, 1967, notably at paragraph 117, in \n     the words of Ambassador Kouznetsov of the Soviet Union), \n     which signified the international community's intention of \n     having the resolution address the rights of all Middle East \n     refugees; and\n       (B) a statement by Justice Arthur Goldberg, the Chief \n     Delegate of the United States to the United Nations at that \n     time, who was instrumental in drafting the unanimously \n     adopted United Nations Resolution 242, where he pointed out \n     that ``The resolution addresses the objective of `achieving a \n     just settlement of the refugee problem'. This language \n     presumably refers both to Arab and Jewish refugees, for about \n     an equal number of each abandoned their homes as a result of \n     the several wars.'';\n       (2) the Madrid Conference, which was first convened in \n     October 1991 and was co-chaired by President of the United \n     States, George H.W.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND REFUGEES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States deplores the past and present ongoing \n     violation of the human rights and religious freedoms of \n     minority populations in Arab and Muslim countries throughout \n     the Middle East, North Africa, and the Persian Gulf; and\n       (2) with respect to Jews, Christians, and other populations \n     displaced from countries in the region, for any comprehensive \n     Middle East peace agreement to be credible, durable, \n     enduring, and constitute an end to conflict in the Middle \n     East, the agreement must address and resolve all outstanding \n     issues, including the legitimate rights of all refugees of \n     the Middle East.\n\n     SEC. 2. UNITED STATES POLICY ON REFUGEES OF THE MIDDLE EAST.\n\n       The Senate urges the President to--\n       (1) instruct the United States Permanent Representative to \n     the United Nations and all representatives of the United \n     States in bilateral and multilateral fora that when \n     considering or addressing resolutions that allude to the \n     issue of Middle East refugees, they should ensure that--\n       (A) relevant text refers to the fact that multiple refugee \n     populations have been created by the Arab-Israeli conflict; \n     and\n       (B) any explicit reference to the required resolution of \n     the Palestinian refugee issue is matched by a similar \n     explicit reference to the resolution of the issue of Jewish, \n     Christian, and other refugees from Arab countries; and\n       (2) make clear that the Government of the United States \n     supports the position that, as an integral part of any \n     comprehensive peace, the issue of refugees and the mass \n     violations of human rights of minorities in Arab and Muslim \n     countries throughout the Middle East, North Africa, and the \n     Persian Gulf must be resolved in a manner that includes--\n\n[[Page S5259]]\n\n       (A) consideration of the legitimate rights of all refugees \n     displaced from Arab countries; and\n       (B) recognition of the losses incurred by Jews, Christians, \n     and other minority groups as a result of the Arab-Israeli \n     conflict.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/25/senate-section/article/S5259-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 495--DESIGNATING JUNE 8, 2006, AS THE DAY OF A \n                    NATIONAL VIGIL FOR LOST PROMISE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Biden, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Specter, Mr. \nDurbin, Mr. Talent, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Dodd, and Ms. Murkowski) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 495\n\n       Whereas over 26,000 citizens die from the effects of drug \n     abuse each year;\n       Whereas the damage from drugs is not limited to drug \n     abusers, the collateral damage from drugs is enormous, and \n     drug abuse costs society over $60,000,000,000 in social costs \n     and lost productivity;\n       Whereas drugs rob users, their families, and all the people \n     of the United States of dreams, promises, ambitions, talents, \n     and lives;\n       Whereas drug abuse affects millions of families in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the stigma of drug abuse and the cloak of denial \n     keep many individuals and families from dealing with the \n     impact of drugs;\n       Whereas many friends and families are ashamed to \n     acknowledge the death of their loved ones caused by drug \n     abuse;\n       Whereas all the people of the United States can benefit \n     from illuminating the problem of drug abuse and its impact on \n     families, communities, and society;\n       Whereas the futures of thousands of youth of the United \n     States have been cut short because of drug abuse, including \n     the life of--\n       (1) Irma Perez, who suffered and died of an Ecstasy \n     overdose at age 14;\n       (2) David Manlove, who wanted to be a doctor, but died from \n     inhalant abuse at age 16;\n       (3) David Pease, an articulate debater, who died of a \n     heroin overdose at age 23;\n       (4) Ian Eaccarino, a college student who died of a heroin \n     overdose at age 20;\n       (5) Jason Surks, who was studying to be a pharmacist, but \n     died of prescription drug abuse at age 19;\n       (6) Kelley McEnery Baker, who died of an overdose of \n     Ecstasy at age 23;\n       (7) Ryan Haight, who died of an overdose of prescription \n     drugs he had purchased over the Internet at age 18; and\n       (8) Taylor Hooton, a high school baseball star whose life \n     was cut short by steroids at age 16;\n       Whereas these deaths represent only a small sample of the \n     lost promise that drug abuse has cost the future of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas law enforcement, public health and research \n     organizations, community coalitions, drug prevention outreach \n     organizations, individual parents, siblings, friends, and \n     concerned citizens are joining together on June 8, 2006, in a \n     Vigil for Lost Promise, to call public attention to the \n     tremendous promise which has been lost with the deaths of \n     those affected by drugs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 8, 2006, as the day of a National Vigil \n     for Lost Promise; and\n       (2) encourages all young people to choose to live a drug-\n     free life;\n       (3) encourages all people of the United States to work to \n     stop drug abuse before it starts and remain vigilant against \n     the far reaching loss of promise caused by deaths from drug \n     abuse;\n       (4) encourages all citizens of the United States to \n     remember the lost promise of youth caused by drug abuse on \n     this day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/25/senate-section/article/S5259-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4188.

The \n     Secretary shall work, the to maximum extent possible, to \n     ensure that identification documents issued by Canada that \n     are used as described in this paragraph contain the same \n     technology as identification documents issued by the United \n     States (or any State).\n       (6) Additional pilot programs.--To the maximum extent \n     possible, the Secretary shall seek to conduct pilot programs \n     related to Passport Cards and the State Enrollment \n     Demonstration Program described in this subsection on the \n     international border between the United States and Canada and \n     the international border between the United States and \n     Mexico.\n       (e) Expedited Processing for Repeat Travelers.--\n       (1) Land crossings.--To the maximum extent practicable at \n     the United States border with Canada and the United States \n     border with Mexico, the Secretary shall expand expedited \n     traveler programs carried out by the Secretary to all ports \n     of entry and should encourage citizens of the United States \n     to participate in the preenrollment programs, as such \n     programs assist border control officers of the United States \n     in the fight against terrorism by increasing the number of \n     known travelers crossing the border. The identities of such \n     expedited travelers should be entered into a database of \n     known travelers who have been subjected to in-depth \n     background and watch-list checks to permit border control \n     officers to focus more attention on unknown travelers, \n     potential criminals, and terrorists. The Secretary, in \n     consultation with the appropriate officials of the Government \n     of Canada, shall equip at least 6 additional northern border \n     crossings with NEXUS technology and 6 additional southern \n     ports of entry with SENTRI technology.\n       (2) Sea crossings.--The Commissioner of Customs and Border \n     Patrol shall conduct and expand trusted traveler programs and \n     pilot programs to facilitate expedited processing of United \n     States citizens returning from pleasure craft trips in \n     Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, or Bermuda.

Officers of the United States Customs and Border \n     Patrol shall educate such individuals about documentary \n     requirements.\n       (g) Travel by Children.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, the Secretary shall develop a procedure to \n     accommodate groups of children traveling by land across an \n     international border under adult supervision with parental \n     consent without requiring a government-issued identity and \n     citizenship document.\n       (h) Public Promotion.--The Secretary of State, in \n     consultation with the Secretary, shall develop and implement \n     an outreach plan to inform United States citizens about the \n     Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative and the provisions of \n     this Act, to facilitate the acquisition of appropriate \n     documentation to travel to Canada, Mexico, the countries \n     located in the Caribbean, and Bermuda, and to educate United \n     States citizens who are unaware of the requirements for such \n     travel. Such outreach plan should include--\n       (1) written notifications posted at or near public \n     facilities, including border crossings, schools, libraries, \n     Amtrak stations, and United States Post Offices located \n     within 50 miles of the international border between the \n     United States and Canada or the international border between \n     the United States and Mexico and other ports of entry;\n       (2) provisions to seek consent to post such notifications \n     on commercial property, such as offices of State departments \n     of motor vehicles, gas stations, supermarkets, convenience \n     stores, hotels, and travel agencies;\n       (3) the collection and analysis of data to measure the \n     success of the public promotion plan; and\n       (4) additional measures as appropriate.\n       (i) Certification.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the Secretary may not implement the plan described in \n     section 7209(b) of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \n     Prevention Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-458; 8 U.S.C. 1185 \n     note) until the later of June 1, 2009, or the date that is 3 \n     months after the Secretary of State and the Secretary certify \n     to Congress that--\n       (1)(A) if the Secretary and the Secretary of State develop \n     and issue Passport Cards under this section--\n       (i) such cards have been distributed to at least 90 percent \n     of the eligible United States citizens who applied for such \n     cards during the 6-month period beginning not earlier than \n     the date the Secretary of State began accepting applications \n     for such cards and ending not earlier than 10 days prior to \n     the date of certification;\n       (ii) Passport Cards are provided to applicants, on average, \n     within 4 weeks of application or within the same period of \n     time required to adjudicate a passport; and\n       (iii) a successful pilot has demonstrated the effectiveness \n     of the Passport Card; or\n       (B) if the Secretary and the Secretary of State do not \n     develop and issue Passport Cards under this section and \n     develop a program to issue an alternative document that \n     satisfies the requirements of section 7209 of the \n     Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, in \n     addition to the NEXUS, SENTRI, FAST and Border Crossing Card \n     programs, such alternative document is widely available and \n     well publicized;\n       (2) United States border crossings have been equipped with \n     sufficient document readers and other technologies to ensure \n     that implementation will not substantially slow the flow of \n     traffic and persons across international borders;\n       (3) officers of the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection \n     have received training and been provided the infrastructure \n     necessary to accept Passport Cards and all alternative \n     identity documents at all United States border crossings; and\n       (4) the outreach plan described in subsection (g) has been \n     implemented and the Secretary determines such plan has been \n     successful in providing information to United States \n     citizens.\n       (j) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Secretary of State and the \n     Secretary such sums as may be necessary to carry out this \n     section, and the amendment made by this section.\n       On page 54, line 1, strike ``555'' and insert ``556''.\n       On page 55, between lines 4 and 5, strike ``555'' and \n     insert ``556''.\n       On page 55, line 7, strike ``555'' and insert ``556''.\n       On page 55, line 15, strike ``554'' and insert ``556''.\n       On page 55, line 16, strike ``132'' and insert ``142''.\n       On page 55, line 21, strike ``554'' and insert ``556''.\n       Beginning on page 78, line 25, strike ``instituted in the \n     United States District Court for the District of Columbia'' \n     and insert ``brought in a United States district court''.\n       On page 81, line 10, insert ``Immigration'' before \n     ``Reform''.\n       On page 151, between lines 6 and 7, insert the following:\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Director of the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigations $3,125,000 for each of fiscal years 2007 \n     through 2011 for improving the speed and accuracy of \n     background and security checks conducted by the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigations on behalf of the Bureau of \n     Citizenship and Immigrations Services.\n       (d) Report on Background and Security Checks.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Director of the Federal Bureau \n     of Investigations shall submit to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary of the Senate and the Committee on the Judiciary of \n     the House of Representatives a report on the background and \n     security checks conducted by the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigations on behalf of the Bureau of Citizenship and \n     Immigrations Services\n       (2) Content.--The report required under paragraph (1) shall \n     include--\n       (A) a description of the background and security check \n     program;\n       (B) a statistical breakdown of the background and security \n     check delays associated with different types of immigration \n     applications;\n       (C) a statistical breakdown of the background and security \n     check delays by applicant country of origin;

and\n       (B) can or should be modified to reduce such burdens \n     without harming the usefulness of such filing rules to \n     Federal, State, and local anti-terrorism, law enforcement, \n     and regulatory operations.\n       (c) Period Covered.--The study required under subsection \n     (a) shall cover the period beginning at least 3 calendar \n     years prior to the date of enactment of this section.\n       (d) Content.--The study required under subsection (a) shall \n     include a detailed evaluation of--\n       (1) the extent to which depository institutions are \n     availing themselves of the exemption system for the filing of \n     currency transaction reports set forth in section 103.22(d) \n     of title 31, Code of Federal Regulations, as in\n\n[[Page S5283]]\n\n     effect during the study period (in this section referred to \n     as the ``exemption system''), including specifically, for the \n     study period--\n       (A) the number of currency transaction reports filed (out \n     of the total annual numbers) involving companies that are \n     listed on the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ National \n     Market;\n       (B) the number of currency transaction reports filed by the \n     100 largest depository institutions in the United States by \n     asset size, and thereafter in tiers of 100, by asset size;\n       (C) the number of currency transaction reports filed by the \n     200 smallest depository institutions in the United States, \n     including the number of such currency transaction reports \n     involving companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange or \n     the NASDAQ National Market; and\n       (D) the number of currency transaction reports that would \n     have been filed during the filing period if the exemption \n     system had been used by all depository institutions in the \n     United States;\n       (2) what types of depository institutions are using the \n     exemption system, and the extent to which such exemption \n     system is used;\n       (3) difficulties that limit the willingness or ability of \n     depository institutions to reduce their currency transaction \n     reports reporting burden by making use of the exemption \n     system, including considerations of cost, especially in the \n     case of small depository institutions;\n       (4) the extent to which bank examination difficulties have \n     limited the use of the exemption system, especially with \n     respect to--\n       (A) the exemption of privately-held companies permitted \n     under such exemption system; and\n       (B) whether, on a sample basis, the reaction of bank \n     examiners to implementation of such exemption system is \n     justified or inhibits use of such exemption system without an \n     offsetting compliance benefit;\n       (5) ways to improve the use of the exemption system by \n     depository institutions, including making such exemption \n     system mandatory in order to reduce the volume of currency \n     transaction reports unnecessarily filed; and\n       (6) the usefulness of currency transaction reports filed to \n     law enforcement agencies, taking into account--\n       (A) advances in information technology;\n       (B) the impact, including possible loss of investigative \n     data, that various changes in the exemption system would have \n     on the usefulness of such currency transaction reports; and\n       (C) changes that could be made to the exemption system \n     without affecting the usefulness of currency transaction \n     reports.\n       (e) Assistance.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     provide such information processing and other assistance, \n     including from the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue \n     Service and the Director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement \n     Network, to the Comptroller General in analyzing currency \n     transaction report filings for the study period described in \n     subsection (c), as is necessary to provide the information \n     required by subsection (a).\n       (f) Views.--The study required under subsection (a) shall, \n     if appropriate, include a discussion of the views of a \n     representative sample of Federal, State, and local law \n     enforcement and regulatory officials and officials of \n     depository institutions of all sizes.\n       (g) Recommendations.--The study required under subsection \n     (a) shall, if appropriate, include recommendations for \n     changes to the exemption system that would reflect a \n     reduction in unnecessary cost to depository institutions, \n     assuming reasonably full implementation of such exemption \n     system, without reducing the usefulness of the currency \n     transaction report filing system to anti-terrorism, law \n     enforcement, and regulatory operations.\n       (h) Report.--Not later than 15 months after the date of \n     enactment of this section, the Comptroller General shall \n     submit a report on the study required under subsection (a) to \n     the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the \n     Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House \n     of Representatives.\n\n     SEC. 1002.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on S. \n1235, the Veterans' Housing Opportunity and Benefits Act of 2006. This \nlegislation is the product of a compromise agreement reached between \nthe Senate and House Committees on Veterans' Affairs. The legislation \ncleared the House on Monday by a unanimous vote of 372 to 0. Its \npassage today in the Senate will continue the tradition of cooperation \nbetween the two Houses of Congress and among all political parties when \nit comes to legislation to improve the benefits and services available \nfor our nation's veterans.\n  Before I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who worked \ndiligently on the provisions of this bill, I would like to take a few \nmoments to comment on provisions that I was particularly interested in \nseeing enacted in that they will impact the lives of servicemembers \nreturning from the global war on terrorism who have severe \ndisabilities.\n  It is quite natural, and in many cases necessary for therapeutic or \nrehabilitative reasons, for a young servicemember who is severely \nwounded to spend some time convalescing at the home of his or her \nfamily before moving on to live a fully independent life. The nature of \nsome severely wounded servicemembers' wounds require adaptations to the \nhomes in which they live--such as larger doorways, ramps, hand rails, \nand other modifications. VA has a grant program to assist \nservicemembers and veterans with expenses associated with these \nmodifications, but the program needs greater flexibility to address the \nreality of how young wounded warriors convalesce. Section 101 of the \nlegislation provides that flexibility. It authorizes VA to equip a \nfamily member's home using a partial grant--with some portion, or all, \nof the remainder of the grant available for later use--of between \n$2,000 and $14,000. I was proud to join Senator John Sununu on an \namendment that cleared the Senate earlier this year that contained this \nprovision. I am even prouder that we were able to include it in the \nfinal bill.\n  Section 301 of S. 1235 is another provision that makes a reasonable \naccommodation in a benefit program to meet the realities faced by \nconvalescing, severely disabled servicemembers. Servicemembers \nadjudicated as totally disabled at the time of their separation from \nservice have up to one year after separation to apply to receive \npremium-free Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance coverage during the \n1-year, post separation period, and to convert their coverage to \nVeterans' Group Life Insurance, or an individual plan or policy. Taking \nadvantage of the conversion option is especially critical for totally \ndisabled veterans who, because of their disabilities, may not be \ninsurable at competitive commercial rates after military service. \nThrough a targeted outreach effort to this population, VA learned that \nmany totally disabled veterans do not convert their coverage to VGLI \nbecause they may have neglected post-separation financial planning due \nto the effects of their disabilities, or because they were simply \nunaware of the extension option. To give these convalescing \nservicemembers as much time as possible to make informed decisions \nabout their future financial security, section 301 would extend from 1 \nto 2 years the available conversion period.\n  There are many other enhancements contained in this legislation. They \ncover housing, insurance, employment and other miscellaneous benefit \nprograms. And, not a small point in this time of fiscal austerity, the \nlegislation is budget neutral.\n  I would like to take a moment to thank those who are responsible for \nbringing this compromise agreement to the brink of enactment. First, \nthe committee's ranking member, Senator Daniel Akaka, provided his \ncustomary--and indispensable--cooperation and leadership. He and his \nstaff worked very closely with me and my staff to shepherd the original \nlegislation through the Senate, and then to work together with my House \ncolleagues on this compromise. Veterans in Hawaii should be proud to \nhave Senator Akaka at the helm. And I am proud to have him as the \ncommittee's ranking member.\n  I salute Chairman Steve Buyer and Ranking Member Lane Evans of the \nHouse Veterans' Committee; Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and \nMemorial Affairs Chairman Jeff Miller and Ranking Member Shelley \nBerkley; and Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity Chairman John Boozman \nand Ranking Member Stephanie Herseth for their work and for their \nspirit of accommodation. They and their staffs are to be commended for \na job well done.\n  Yesterday, the Congress sent bipartisan legislation, the Respect for \nAmerica's Fallen Heroes Act, to the President for his signature. Today, \nI am also asking my colleagues in the Senate to send the Veterans' \nHousing Opportunity and Benefits Act of 2006, to the President. I am \nthankful that our celebration of Memorial Day on Monday coincides with \nthe Congress sending so strong a message of support to those who have \nworn the uniform.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the attached \njoint explanatory statement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Explanatory Statement on Amendment to Senate Bill, S. 1235, as Amended\n\n       S. 1235, as amended, the Veterans' Housing Opportunity and \n     Benefits Improvement Act of 2006, reflects a Compromise \n     Agreement reached by the Senate and House Committees on \n     Veterans' Affairs (the Committees) on the following bills \n     reported during the 109th Congress: S. 1235, as amended \n     (Senate Bill), H.R. 1220, as amended, H.R. 2046, as amended, \n     and H.R. 3665, as amended (House Bills). S. 1235, as amended, \n     passed the Senate on September 28, 2005; H.R. 2046, as \n     amended, passed the House on May 23, 2005; H.R. 3665, as \n     amended, passed the House on November 10, 2005.\n       The Committees have prepared the following explanation of \n     S. 1235, as further amended to reflect a compromise agreement \n     between the Committees (Compromise Agreement). Differences \n     between the provisions contained in the Compromise Agreement \n     and the related provisions of the Senate Bill and the House \n     Bills are noted in this document, except for clerical \n     corrections, conforming changes made necessary by the \n     Compromise Agreement, and minor drafting, technical, and \n     clarifying changes.\n\n\n                        TITLE I--HOUSING MATTERS\n\n     Adapted housing assistance for disabled veterans residing in \n         housing owned by family member\n     Current law\n       Chapter 21 of title 38, United States Code, authorizes the \n     Secretary to provide grants to adapt or acquire suitable \n     housing for certain severely disabled veterans. The grant \n     amounts are limited to $50,000 for severely disabled veterans \n     with impairments of locomotion or loss of function of both \n     arms described in section 2101(a) of title 38, United States \n     Code, and $10,000 to severely disabled veterans with loss of \n     vision or loss of function of both hands as described in \n     section 2101(b) of title 38, United States Code. Currently a \n     veteran may receive a grant for specially adapted housing \n     only once. However, a veteran who has qualified for the \n     smaller grant may nonetheless receive a higher grant if \n     disabilities under that provision later develop.\n     Senate bill\n       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.\n     House bills\n       Section 101(a) through (e) of H.R. 3665, as amended, would \n     amend chapter 21 of title 38, United States Code, by \n     inserting a new section 2102A. Subparagraph (a) would \n     authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to conduct a \n     program providing a partial adapted housing grant to severely \n     injured veterans residing temporarily in housing owned by a \n     family member. Subparagraph (b) would authorize the Secretary \n     to provide up to a $10,000 grant for such veterans with \n     disabilities involving impairments of locomotion and up to a \n     $2,000 grant for such veterans with visual impairments or \n     loss of function of both hands. Subparagraph (c) would limit \n     the assistance to one family residence. Subparagraph (d) \n     would require the Secretary to issue relevant regulations. \n     Finally, subparagraph (e) would limit the program to 5 years \n     after enactment.\n       Section 101(b) of H.R. 3665, as amended, would amend \n     section 2102 of title 38, United States Code, to allow a \n     veteran to receive no more than three grants of assistance \n     under chapter 21 of title 38, United States Code.\n\n[[Page S5292]]\n\n     The total value of all grants would not exceed $50,000 for \n     the most severely disabled veterans and $10,000 for less \n     severely disabled veterans. However, a veteran who receives a \n     grant under section 2102(b) of title 38, United States Code, \n     would still be allowed to receive grants under section \n     2102(a) of title 38, United States Code, if he or she becomes \n     eligible.\n       Section 101(c) would amend chapter 21 of title 38, United \n     States Code, by adding at the end a new section 2107 to \n     provide that the Secretary shall coordinate the \n     administration of programs to provide specially adapted \n     housing that are administered by both the Under Secretary for \n     Health and the Under Secretary for Benefits under chapters \n     17, 21, and 31 of title 38, United States Code.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 101 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows \n     the House language except in the case of veterans residing \n     temporarily in housing owned by a family member, veterans \n     with disabilities involving impairments of locomotion may \n     receive up to $14,000. Section 101 would also increase the \n     funding fee for a subsequent use of the VA home loan guaranty \n     with no money down by 5 basis points for the period October \n     1, 2006 through September 30, 2007.\n     Adjustable rate mortgages\n     Current law\n       Section 3707A(c)(4) of title 38, United States Code, limits \n     the maximum increase or decrease of any single annual \n     interest rate adjustment after the initial contract interest \n     rate adjustment to 1 percentage point.\n     Senate bill\n       Section 201 of the Senate Bill would give VA the \n     flexibility to prescribe an appropriate annual rate \n     adjustment cap for VA hybrid Adjustable Rate Mortgage loans \n     with an initial rate of interest fixed for 5 or more years.\n     House bills\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 102 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n     Permanent authority to make direct housing loans to native \n         american veterans\n     Current law\n       Section 3761 of title 38, United States Code, establishes a \n     pilot program to make direct housing loans to Native American \n     veterans for homes on tribal lands. The authorization \n     expires on December 31, 2008. Section 3762 of title 38, \n     United States Code, describes the administration of the \n     program and limits the maximum loan amount to $80,000, \n     unless the Secretary allows a larger amount due to higher \n     housing costs in a particular geographic area.\n     Senate bill\n       Section 203 of the Senate Bill contains a similar \n     provision.\n     House bills\n       Section 102 of H.R. 3665, as amended, would make permanent \n     the Native American Veteran Housing Loan Program. It would \n     also limit the Secretary's discretion in approving a loan \n     larger than $80,000 to the loan limitation amount provided by \n     the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act for a single-\n     family residence.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 103 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     language.\n     Extension of Eligibility for direct loans for Native American \n         Veterans to a veteran who is the spouse of a Native \n         American\n     Current law\n       Section 3761 of title 38, United States Code, limits loans \n     under the Native American Home Loan Program to veterans who \n     are Native Americans. Under current law, a veteran residing \n     on tribal lands with a Native American spouse is not eligible \n     to receive a home loan under this program.\n     Senate bill\n       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.\n     House bills\n       Section 103 of H.R. 3665, as amended, would extend \n     eligibility for the Native American Veteran Housing Loan \n     Program to non-Native American veterans who are spouses of \n     Native Americans eligible to be housed on tribal land. The \n     non-Native American veteran must be able to acquire a \n     meaningful interest in the property under tribal law.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 104 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     language.\n     Technical Corrections to Veterans' Benefit Improvement Act of \n         2004\n     Current law\n       Section 2101 of title 38, United States Code, provides for \n     grants to adapt or acquire suitable housing for certain \n     severely disabled veterans. Section 401 of Public Law 108-183 \n     amended section 2101 to authorize the Secretary of Veterans \n     Affairs to provide adapted housing assistance to certain \n     disabled servicemembers who have not yet been processed for \n     discharge from military service, but who will qualify for the \n     benefit upon discharge due to the severity of their \n     disabilities. However, this provision was inadvertently \n     omitted from section 2101 of title 38, United States Code \n     when changes to that section were made by P.L. 108-454.\n     Senate bill\n       Section 202 of S. 1235 would amend section 2101 of title \n     38, United States Code, to reinstate the authority of the \n     Secretary to provide adapted housing assistance to certain \n     members of the armed services and make other conforming \n     amendments. The amendments made by this provision would take \n     effect on December 10, 2004, immediately after the enactment \n     of Public Law 108-454.\n     House bills\n       Section 4 of H.R. 2046, as amended, contains a similar \n     provision.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 105 of the Compromise Agreement contains this \n     provision.\n\n\n                      TITLE II--EMPLOYMENT MATTERS\n\n     Additional duty for the Assistant Secretary of Labor for \n         Veterans' Employment and Training to raise awareness of \n         skills of veterans and of the benefits of hiring veterans\n     Current law\n       Subsection (b) of section 4102A of title 38, United States \n     Code, describes the duties to be carried out by the Assistant \n     Secretary of Labor for Veterans' Employment and Training.\n     Senate bill\n       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.\n     House bills\n       Section 202(a) of H.R. 3665, as amended, would add a new \n     duty for the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Veterans' \n     Employment and Training (ASVET) under section 4102A of title \n     38, United States Code, to furnish information to employers \n     (through meetings with hiring executives of corporations and \n     otherwise) concerning the training and skills of veterans and \n     disabled veterans, and the advantages of hiring veterans. The \n     ASVET would also be required to facilitate employment of \n     veterans and disabled veterans through participation in labor \n     exchanges (Internet-based and otherwise), and by other means.\n       Section 202(b) of H.R. 3665, as amended, would require the \n     Secretary of Labor, acting through the ASVET, to develop a \n     transition plan for the ASVET to assume certain duties and \n     functions of the President's National Hire Veterans Committee \n     and transmit the plan to the House and Senate Veterans' \n     Affairs Committees not later than July 1, 2006.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 201 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows \n     the House language, but does not include the requirement that \n     the Secretary of Labor develop and transmit a transition \n     plan.\n     Modifications to the Advisory Committee on Veterans \n         Employment and Training\n     Current law\n       Section 4110 of title 38, United States Code, establishes \n     the Advisory Committee on Veterans Employment and Training, \n     its membership, and its duties. The Advisory Committee \n     advises the ASVET on the employment and training needs of \n     veterans and how the Department of Labor is meeting those \n     needs.

Mr. President, today I rise in strong support of S. 1235, \nthe Veterans' Housing Opportunity and Benefits Improvement Act of 2006. \nThis legislation passed the House unanimously on Monday, and I urge my \nSenate colleagues to do the same.\n  S. 1235 contains many important provisions, but I would like to focus \nmy remarks on section 101 of the bill, which deals with adaptive \nhousing grants. Section 101 upgrades eligibility criteria for housing \nassistance grants to better reflect the needs of today's veteran \ncommunity and will help all disabled veterans move home from medical \nfacilities sooner. The language in section 101 is almost identical to \nmy bipartisan legislation, S. 1947, The Specially Adapted Housing \nImprovements Grants Act and a bi-partisan amendment I introduced to S. \n1932, the Deficit Reduction Act, which passed the Senate unanimously by \nvoice vote.\n  First, I want to acknowledge my House colleague, Representative John \nBoozman of Arkansas, who serves as Chairman of the Veterans' Affairs \nSubcommittee on Economic Opportunity and has demonstrated real \nleadership on this issue. I am grateful to him for his considerable \nefforts to advance this measure in the House and I am happy to do so \nhere in this Chamber. I also appreciate the hard work of the Chairman \nof the Veterans' Affairs Committee here in the Senate, Senator Craig, \nand the bipartisan group of Senators who cosponsored both my bill and \namendment. The broad support of S. 1235 and its provisions represent a \nbipartisan belief on Capitol Hill that Congress must constantly \nevaluate veterans programs to make certain that our Nation provides \nresponsive support to veterans.\n  While representing New Hampshire in the House and Senate, I have \nworked to ensure that those who served in our armed services receive \ntheir hard-earned benefits quickly and in full. Too often, out-of-date \nand burdensome regulations deny qualified veterans from receiving the \nbenefits to which they are entitled. Whenever possible, it is \nimperative that we remove red tape that does not take into account the \nrealities faced by today's veterans.\n  That is why I introduced legislation to reform rules that determine \nrequirements for a Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, grant program \nthat helps many disabled veterans make their\n\n[[Page S5295]]\n\nhomes suitable for occupancy. Currently, a disabled veteran must at \nleast partly own his or her residence to receive VA housing assistance \ngrants to perform necessary residence modifications, such as installing \nwheelchair ramps or railings. However, many younger veterans returning \nfrom Iraq and Afghanistan have not yet had the opportunity to become \nhomeowners. Being ineligible for VA funding assistance to modify their \nhomes, these veterans and their families often are compelled to either \nshoulder the costs of retrofitting their residences or face extended \nstays in VA medical facilities.\n  Section 101 of S. 1235 will establish a 5-year pilot program to allow \nseverely disabled veterans who live temporarily with family to receive \nup to $10,000 in adaptive housing assistance; less severely disabled \nveterans could receive a maximum of $2,000. This grant money will help \nensure that all disabled veterans--regardless of whether they own \nproperty--are able to leave hospitals and return home as quickly as \npossible.\n  Also, mindful that these individuals will likely purchase their own \nresidence, the bill will allow disabled veterans to receive two \nadditional specially adaptive housing grants to be used for homes that \nthey own in the future. Severely disabled veterans could receive a \ntotal of $50,000 to modify residences; less severely disabled veterans \nwould be eligible for a total of $10,000. Only one of the three total \ngrants could be used for a temporary residence, such as a family-owned \nhome.\n  America's veterans have made enormous sacrifices to protect our \nNation and the ideals for which it stands. Our country owes a special \nobligation to those men and women who have become disabled as a result \nof their service. Under no circumstances should these American heroes \nbe divided into groups of ``haves'' and ``have nots.''\n  This Nation must do no less than to ensure that all disabled veterans \nare returned to the normalcy of home life as quickly and comfortably as \npossible. The common sense changes put forth in section 101 of S. 1235 \ndo just that, and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to send this bill \nto President Bush to sign in to law in time, fittingly, for Memorial \nDay.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I urge my colleagues to support our current \nservicemembers, veterans, and their families by supporting the pending \nmeasure, the final agreement on the Veterans' Housing Opportunity and \nBenefits Improvement Act of 2006. This is a vital and timely piece of \nlegislation that has already passed the House of Representatives. With \nSenate passage today and the President's signature it will quickly \nbecome public law.\n  Mr. President, this measure, which I shall refer to as the \n``Compromise Agreement,'' will improve and expand a wide variety of \nveterans benefits and programs, including, among others, housing \nbenefits for Native American veterans and severely disabled \nservicemembers; insurance benefits for certain disabled veterans; \ncompensation benefits for former prisoners of war; and programs that \nprovide assistance to homeless veterans.\n  This legislation is appropriate at a time when our servicemembers are \nin harm's way. We must always remember the sacrifices that our \nservicemembers, both past and present, have made on behalf of this \ngreat Nation and we must do our part to respond to their service by \nimproving and expanding veterans benefits.\n  In 1992, I authored the legislation that established a pilot program \nto make direct housing loans to Native American veterans for homes on \ntribal lands. As of the end of April, VA had made 504 loans to this \ngroup of veterans. Under this program, VA offers loan guarantees that \nprotect lenders against loss up to the amount of the guaranty if the \nborrower fails to repay the loan. Prior to the enactment of this law, \nNative American veterans residing on tribal lands were unable to \nqualify for VA home loan benefits. With the Native American Veteran \nHousing Loan Program indigenous peoples residing on trust lands are now \nable to use this very important VA benefit. I am pleased that the \nCompromise Agreement contains a provision derived from legislation I \noffered, S. 917, that would make this pilot program, which was set to \nexpire on December 31, 2008, permanent.\n  The Compromise Agreement also extends, from 1 to 2 years, the amount \nof time a disabled servicemember has to convert his or her \nServicemembers' Group Life Insurance coverage into Veterans' Group Life \nInsurance coverage. This change is being made so that veterans may \nconcentrate on recovering from their injuries or conditions, and not on \nmeeting deadlines for life insurance conversion.\n  Under current law, former prisoners of war have to been held for a \nminimum of 30 days before they can benefit from a presumption that \ncertain diseases are linked to their service. The Compromise Agreement \nalso would add heart disease and stroke to presumptive conditions for \nservice-connection for former prisoners of war.\n  Homelessness among veterans is a critical problem. It is particularly \ntroubling to me that an estimated 56 percent of today's homeless \nveterans are minorities. The homeless rate in my home state of Hawaii \nhas nearly doubled since early 2000, with the majority of Hawaii's new \nhomeless being Native Hawaiians. The city of Honolulu has a tremendous \nproblem with affordable housing, increasing the possibility of becoming \nhomeless for those who already struggle to make ends meet. The \nCompromise Agreement would reauthorize through fiscal year 2009 the \nHomeless Veterans Reintegration Programs, which are the only Federal \nprograms dedicated wholly to providing employment services to homeless \nveterans.\n  Also included in the Compromise Agreement is my provision that would \nmake a technical change to the specially adapted housing grant program. \nLast session, the law that allows severely disabled members of the \nArmed Forces to receive specially adapted housing grants from VA, while \nstill on active duty, was inadvertently repealed. My provision would \ncorrect this and restore the grant to its original intent.\n  In conclusion, I thank Senator Craig and the benefits staff on the \nmajority for their work on this comprehensive bill, especially Jon \nTowers, Amanda Meredith, and Lupe Wissel and, on the Democratic staff \nDahlia Melendrez, Pat Driscoll, and Noe Kalipi for their hard work on \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation on \nbehalf of America's veterans and their families.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent the Senate concur in the House \namendments, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any \nstatements related to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me start by saying that the nomination \nof General Hayden is a difficult one for me. I generally, as a rule, \nbelieve the President should be able to appoint members of his Cabinet, \nof his staff, to positions such as the one General Hayden is nominated \nfor without undue obstruction from Congress.\n  General Hayden is extremely well qualified for this position. Having \npreviously served as head of the National Security Agency and as Deputy \nDirector of National Intelligence under John Negroponte, he has 30 \nyears of experience in intelligence and national security matters. And \nhe was nearly universally praised during his confirmation to Deputy \nDNI.\n  There are several members of the Intelligence Committee, including \nSenator Levin, who I hold in great esteem, who believe General Hayden \nhas consistently displayed the sort of independence that would make him \na fine CIA Director.\n  Unfortunately, General Hayden is being nominated under troubling \ncircumstances, as the architect and chief defender of a program of \nwiretapping and collection of phone records outside of FISA oversight. \nThis is a program that is still accountable to no one and no law.\n  Now, there is no one in Congress who does not want President Bush to \nhave every tool at his disposal to prevent terrorist attacks--including \nthe use of a surveillance program. Every single American--Democrat and \nRepublican and Independent--who remembers the images of falling towers \nand needless death would gladly support increased surveillance in order \nto prevent another attack.\n  But over the last 6 months, Americans have learned that the National \nSecurity Agency has been spying on Americans without judicial approval. \nWe learned about this not from the administration, not from the regular \nworkings of the Senate Intelligence Committee, but from the New York \nTimes and USA Today. Every time a revelation came out, President Bush \nrefused to answer questions from Congress.\n  This is part of a general stance by this administration that it can \noperate without restraint. President Bush is interpreting article II of \nthe Constitution as giving him authority with no bounds. The Attorney \nGeneral and a handful of scholars agree with this view, and I do not \ndoubt the sincerity with which the President and his lawyers believe in \ntheir constitutional interpretation. However, the overwhelming weight \nof legal authority is against the President on this one. This is not \nhow our Constitution is designed, to give the President unbounded \nauthority without any checks or balances.\n  We do not expect the President to give the American people every \ndetail about a classified surveillance program, but we do expect him to \nplace such a program within the rule of law and to allow members of the \nother two coequal branches of Government--Congress and the judiciary--\nto have the ability to monitor and oversee such a program. Our \nConstitution and our right to privacy as Americans require as much.\n  Unfortunately, we were never given the chance to make that \nexamination. Time and again, President Bush has refused to come clean \nto Congress. Why is it that 14 of 16 members of the Intelligence \nCommittee were kept in the dark for 4\\1/2\\ years? The only reason that \nsome Senators are now being briefed is because the story was made \npublic in the newspapers. Without that information, it is impossible to \nmake the decisions that allow us to balance the need to fight terrorism \nwhile still upholding the rule of law and privacy protections that make \nthis country great.\n\n  Every democracy is tested when it is faced with a serious threat. As \na nation, we have had to find the right balance between privacy and \nsecurity, between executive authority to face threats and uncontrolled \npower. What protects us, and what distinguishes us, are the procedures \nwe put in place to protect that balance; namely, judicial warrants and \ncongressional review. These are not arbitrary ideas. They are not new \nideas. These are the safeguards that make sure surveillance has not \ngone too far, that somebody is watching the watchers.\n  The exact details of these safeguards are not etched in stone. They \ncan be reevaluated, and should be reevaluated, from time to time. The \nlast time we had a major overhaul of the intelligence apparatus was 30 \nyears ago in the aftermath of Watergate. After those dark days, the \nWhite House worked in a collaborative way with Congress through the \nChurch Committee to study the issue, revise intelligence laws, and set \nup a system of checks and balances. It worked then, and it could work \nnow. But, unfortunately, thus far, this administration has made no \neffort to reach out to Congress and tailor FISA to fit the program that \nhas been put in place.\n  I have no doubt that General Hayden will be confirmed. But I am going \nto reluctantly vote against him to send a signal to this administration \nthat even in these circumstances, even in these trying times, President \nBush is not above the law. No President is above the law. I am voting \nagainst Mr. Hayden in the hope that he will be more humble before the \ngreat weight of responsibility that he has not only to protect our \nlives but to protect our democracy.\n  Americans fought a Revolution in part over the right to be free from \nunreasonable searches--to ensure that our Government could not come \nknocking in the middle of the night for no reason. We need to find a \nway forward to make sure we can stop terrorists while protecting the \nprivacy and liberty of innocent Americans. We have to find a way to \ngive the President the power he needs to protect us, while making sure \nhe does not abuse that power. It is possible to do that. We have done \nit before. We could do it again.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak for 5 minutes before the Senator from Michigan speaks--he has \ngraciously agreed to allow me to do that--and then he be given as much \ntime as he needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to first, again, thank \nSenator Carl Levin, who I know has been graciously acceding all night. \nSo he will be the last person to speak here, but I very much appreciate \nit. And I know all of my colleagues do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/25/senate-section/article/S5296-4", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5296-S5298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF BRETT KAVANAUGH\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the confirmation \nof Brett Kavanaugh to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  This court is too important, its jurisdiction too broad, and its \ndecisions too final, for a lifetime seat to be entrusted to someone \nwith such limited nonpartisan experience--even someone as bright as Mr. \nKavanaugh clearly is.\n\n[[Page S5297]]\n\n  First, let me say that I am continually frustrated by the nature of \nthe debate that takes place in the Senate and in the public about the \nso-called politicization of the judicial nomination and confirmation \nprocess. We are often told--with a straight face--that politics and \nideology play no part in the President's thinking when it comes to \njudicial nominations.\n  But, as anyone who is paying attention knows full well: It is the \nPresident who too often picks judicial nominees with politics and \nideology squarely in mind.\n  It is the President who too often picks judicial nominees with an eye \ntowards shoring up his conservative political base. It is the President \nwho too often selects judicial nominees with an eye towards picking a \npolitical fight. And, of course, on at least one occasion--in the case \nof Harriet Miers--it was the President who withdrew a nominee with an \neye towards mitigating political damage.\n  So, those who complain that the process has become politicized and \nthat ideology shouldn't matter should take their quarrel to the other \nend of Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  In this case--especially after Mr. Kavanaugh's second hearing--I \ncontinue to believe that his nomination is too infused with politics \nand that Mr. Kavanaugh himself is neither seasoned enough nor \nindependent enough at this early stage of his career to merit a \nlifetime appointment to the second highest court in the land.\n  Let me say a word about how deeply important the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals is.\n  But there are serious questions as to why, at barely 40, having never \ntried a case, and with a record of service almost exclusively to highly \npartisan political matters, he is being nominated to a seat on the \nsecond most important court in America.\n  Why is the DC Circuit so important?\n  The Supreme Court currently takes fewer than 100 cases a year. That \nmeans that the lower courts resolve the tens of thousands a cases a \nyear brought by Americans seeking to vindicate their rights. All the \nother Federal appellate courts handle just those cases arising from \nwithin its boundaries. So, for example, the Second Circuit, where I am \nfrom, takes cases coming out of New York, Connecticut, and Vermont.\n  But the DC Circuit doesn't just take cases brought by residents of \nWashington, DC. Congress has decided there is value in vesting one \ncourt with the power to review certain decisions of administrative \nagencies.\n  We have given plaintiffs the power to choose the DC Circuit--and in \ncome cases we have forced them to go to the DC Circuit--because we have \ndecided for better or worse, that when it comes to these administrative \ndecisions one court should decide what the law is for the whole Nation.\n  When it comes to regulations adopted under the Clean Air Act by the \nEPA, labor decisions made by the NLRB and rules propounded by OSHA, gas \nprices regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and many \nother administrative matters, the decisions are usually made by the \njudges on the DC Circuit, to which Mr. Kavanaugh aspires.\n  To most, it seems like this is the ``Alphabet Soup Court,'' since \nvirtually every case involves an agency with an unintelligible \nacronym--EPA, NLRA, FCC, SEC, FTC, FERC, and so on, and so on.\n  But the letters that make up this ``Alphabet Soup'' are what make our \nGovernment tick. They are the agencies that write and enforce the rules \nthat determine how much ``reform'' there will be in campaign finance \nreform. They determine how clean the water has to be for it to be safe \nfor our families to drink. They establish the rights workers have when \nnegotiating with corporate powers.\n  The DC Circuit is important because its decisions determine how these \nFederal agencies go about doing their jobs. And, in so doing, it \ndirectly impacts the daily lives of all Americans more than any other \ncourt in the country, with the exception of the Supreme Court.\n  Mr. President, there is so much at stake when considering nominees to \nthe DC Circuit--how their ideological predilections will impact the \ndecisions coming out of the court--and why it is vital for Senators to \nconsider how nominees will impact the delicate ideological balance on \nthe court when deciding how to vote.\n  Given the importance of that court, I cannot vote to confirm Mr. \nKavanaugh. Although Mr. Kavanaugh has held several important and \ninfluential positions in Government, they have been almost exclusively \npolitical. While his academic credentials are undeniably top-notch, he \nhas largely devoted his legal talents to helping notch political \nvictories for his party. While his resume is laden with high-profile \npolitical assignments, it is light on the kinds of professional and \nnonpartisan accomplishments typical of recent nominees to this \nimportant court.\n  Mr. Kavanaugh has been one of the point people among young Republican \nlawyers, appearing at the epicenter of so many high-profile \ncontroversial issues in a relatively short career. That is not in \nitself dispositive, but that is all there is. There is not much more we \ncan rely on to offset this experience.\n  Notwithstanding his legal credentials, he is younger than, and has \nless relevant experience than, almost everyone else who has joined the \nDC Circuit in modern times.\n  If this were a nominee for the district court, where it belongs, \nthere would not be opposition. But it seems as if Mr. Kavanaugh's \nnomination is repayment for services rendered to the political \noperation of the White House and the Republican Party. He does not have \na long list of articles. He does not have a long list of judicial \nexperience, or even of legal experience outside of the political realm. \nAnd it shows you the brazenness of this administration, frankly, that \nhe would be nominated to the second highest court in the land. It shows \nyou that they value ideology and political service above judicial \nexperience and depth.\n  The bottom line is this, that Mr. Kavanaugh does not belong on this \ncourt. If my colleagues on the other side of the aisle were not so apt \nto just rubberstamp every single nominee that this administration puts \nforward, he would not get to this court. But the reason we are unable \nto block this nomination is not because of the merits--I wish we could \nbecause America will regret, I believe, having Mr. Kavanaugh on the \ncourt for decades to come--but it is because, again, we have seen fewer \nthan a handful of times any Republican Member vote against any nominee \nwho this White House nominates.\n  Mr. Kavanaugh is intelligent; no question. Intelligence alone is \nhardly a criteria for the second most important court in the land.\n  Mr. Kavanaugh, when I met him, told me one way to make a judgment \nabout him would be to talk to the people who know him, to talk to \ncolleagues and judges and others familiar with his work. That is what \nthe American Bar Association actually did in preparing his evaluation. \nAnd I have rarely seen an evaluation that has comments such as these: \nOne lawyer said that Mr. Kavanaugh was ``sanctimonious'' and \ninexperienced. A lawyer in a different proceeding said: Mr. Kavanaugh \ndid not handle the case well as an advocate and dissembled. Another \nsaid he was ``inexperienced in the practice of law.'' Others \ncharacterized him as ``insulated.'' One lawyer who worked with him \nquestioned his ability ``to be balanced and fair should he assume a \nfederal judgeship.''\n  Unfortunately, I think that is the reason he was chosen. The \nadministration on this DC Court of Appeals wants people who will not be \nbalanced and fair. They want people who have an ideological ax to \ngrind, to undo the work of Government which this court oversees.\n  It is true that this is the second most important court in the land. \nIt is also true to say that there cannot be a single person in this \nbody, if they were being honest, who does not recognize that there are \nmany more qualified people in Washington to be on this bench.\n  So, Mr. President, I must vote against this nomination, with the full \nconviction that we could do a lot better.\n  Mr. Kavanaugh, if confirmed, would be the youngest person on the D.C. \nCircuit since his mentor, Ken Starr.\n  By a quick review of the preconfirmation accomplishments of the \nactive judges who currently sit on the D.C. Circuit, the nominee's\n\n[[Page S5298]]\n\nachievements--though impressive--are simply not on a par.\n  Every active judge had significant professional and nonpartisan \nexperience to help persuade us that they merited confirmation.\n  I remind my colleagues that in recent months, I voted for two \nRepublican nominees who were deeply involved in the impeachment of \nPresident Clinton--Tom Griffith for the very court to which Mr. \nKavanaugh has been nominated and Paul McNulty to the second highest \nposition in the Justice Department.\n  Now let me come to the ABA report released recently. Some of my \nfriends across the aisle have fallen over themselves to dismiss, \ndilute, and denigrate that report. This, of course, despite the fact \nthat last time around, Mr. Kavanaugh and several Senators frequently \nrepeatedly boasted about his original, higher ABA rating.\n  Here is why the observations noted in that report are important. When \nhe and I met recently, I asked Mr. Kavanaugh how we are to judge \nsomeone with his scant record. He has very few writings. He is younger \nthan almost everyone who has been nominated to the D.C. Circuit. He has \nnever been a judge.\n  Mr. Kavanaugh told me that one way to make a judgment about him would \nbe to talk to the people who know him, to talk to colleagues and judges \nand others who are familiar with him and his work.\n  Well, that is one of the things the American Bar Association actually \ndid in preparing its evaluation. They talked--as Mr. Kavanaugh himself \nsuggested--with people who are familiar with his work.\n  What is more, they do it under a promise of confidentiality, so that \nthey will be likely to obtain the most honest and candid appraisals--\nrather than the expected plaudits from peers and previous employers.\n  Many of those interviewed echoed precisely the concerns that I and \nothers have raised--his lack of relevant experience and the effect the \ninsularity of his political experience might have on his ability to be \na neutral judge.\n  Now, I understand that none of the 14 committee members found Mr. \nKavanaugh flatly ``not qualified.''\n  But I ask my colleagues, shouldn't we give substantial weight to \nthese statements from people who are familiar with his work--not \nisolated remarks, but a multitude of them, from different quarters, \ncommenting about different court appearances and interactions with him?\n  Given the importance of the D.C. Circuit, we have a duty to closely \nscrutinize the nominees who come before us seeking lifetime appointment \nto this court.\n  And it is no insult to Mr. Kavanaugh, to say that there can't be a \nsingle person in this room, if they were being honest, who doesn't \nrecognize that there are scores of lawyers in Washington and around the \ncountry who are of equally high intellectual ability, but who have much \nmore significant judicial, legal, and academic experience to recommend \nthem for this post.\n  So I would say that many of my colleagues and I have a sincere and \ngood-faith concern that this nominee is not apolitical enough, not \nseasoned enough, not independent enough, and has not been forthcoming \nenough. The hearing did not alleviate those concerns.\n  Indeed, Mr. Kavanaugh was evasive when he should have been \nforthright; he sidestepped questions when he should have met them head \non.\n  During an extended exchange with me, he repeatedly refused to answer \na simple question--whether he had ever expressed opposition to a \npotential judicial nominee within the White House, even though there is \nno conceivable earthly privilege that should have prevented him from \nanswering.\n  On another occasion, it took Senator Leahy four tries before Mr. \nKavanaugh would answer the simple question: Why did you take 7 months \nto respond to the Judiciary Committee's written questions in 2004?\n\n  On yet another occasion, he continued to refuse to tell us whether he \nis in the mold of Scalia and Thomas, even though he has spent several \nyears selecting and vetting highly ideological judges for the President \nwho has repeatedly promised to nominate judges in ``the mold of Scalia \nand Thomas.''\n  If the President can say repeatedly at campaign stops and speeches \nthat he wants judges in the mold of Scalia and Thomas, and if those \nstatements are not just meaningless, empty rhetoric, why can't we \nSenators find out in some meaningful way whether there is any truth in \nadvertising?\n  In short, if the nominee had spent the last several years on a lower \ncourt or in a nonpolitical position proving his independence from \npolitics, I could view his nomination in a different light.\n  But he has not. Instead, his resume is almost unambiguously \npolitical. Perhaps with more time, and different experience, we would \nhave greater comfort imagining Mr. Kavanaugh on this court. But that \nday is not yet here.\n  Therefore, I vote nay on the nomination and urge my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  With that, I yield the floor and, once again, thank my colleague from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/25/senate-section/article/S5298-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5298-S5301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NOMINATION OF GENERAL MICHAEL V. HAYDEN\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, General Hayden's nomination for Director of \nthe Central Intelligence Agency comes at a critical time. The Agency is \nin disarray. Its current Director has apparently been forced out, and \nthe previous Director, George Tenet, departed under a cloud after \nhaving compromised his own objectivity and independence and that of his \nAgency by misusing Iraq intelligence to support the administration's \npolicy agenda. The next Director must right this ship and restore the \nCIA to its critically important mission.\n  I will vote to confirm General Hayden because his actions have \ndemonstrated on a number of important occasions the independence and \nstrength of character needed to fulfill the most important role of the \nCIA Director--independence and a willingness to speak truth to power \nabout the intelligence assessments of professionals in the intelligence \ncommunity.\n  This nomination has been considered by me on two key issues: One, \nwhether or not General Hayden will be independent--and I believe he \nwill--and two, what judgment should be rendered about him based on what \nis known about the National Security Agency's surveillance program \nwhich he administered during his tenure as Director of the NSA. Again, \nthe highest priority of the new Director must be to ensure that \nintelligence provided to the President and the Congress is objective \nand independent of political considerations. It was only a few years \nago that then-CIA Director George Tenet shaped intelligence to support \nthe policy position of the administration. There are many examples.\n  On February 11, 2003, just before the war, Director Tenet publicly \nstated, as though it were fact, that Iraq has ``provided training in \npoison and gases to two Al-Qaeda associates.'' However, we now know \nthat the DIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, had assessed a year \nearlier that the primary source of that report was more likely \nintentionally misleading his debriefers, and the CIA itself had \nconcluded in January 2003, before the Tenet public declaration that I \nhave quoted, that the source of the claim that Iraq had provided \ntraining in poisons was not in a position to know if any training had \nin fact taken place.\n  On September 28, 2002, President Bush said that ``each passing day \ncould be the one on which the Iraqi regime gives anthrax or VX nerve \ngas or someday a nuclear weapon to a terrorist group.'' A week later, \non October 7, 2002, a letter declassifying CIA intelligence indicated \nthat Iraq was unlikely to provide WMD to terrorists or al-Qaida and \ncalled such a move an ``extreme step,'' a very different perspective \nfrom that which had been stated by the President. But the very next day \nafter that declassification was obtained, Director Tenet told the press \nthat there was ``no inconsistency'' between the views in the letter and \nthe President's views on the subject.\n  His statement was flatly wrong. His effort to minimize the \ninconsistency or eliminate it not only revealed his lack of \nindependence, but it damaged the credibility of the Central \nIntelligence Agency.\n\n[[Page S5299]]\n\n  At a hearing in 2004, I asked Director Tenet about the alleged \nmeeting between 9/11 hijacker Mohammed Atta and an Iraqi intelligence \nofficer in Prague in April 2001. He told us that the CIA had ``not \ngathered enough evidence to conclude that it had happened'' and that \n``I don't know that it took place. I can't say that I did.'' What he \nneglected to say was that the CIA did not believe that the meeting had \nhappened, a fact that he finally acknowledged publicly in July of 2004, \nafter the war began, when he wrote that the CIA was ``increasingly \nskeptical that such a meeting occurred'' and that there was an \n``absence of any credible information that the April 2001 meeting \noccurred.'' We determined later that that CIA skepticism dated back at \nleast to June 2002, before the war.\n  Director Tenet also looked the other way when the administration \npublicly alleged that Iraq was seeking uranium from Africa. As a matter \nof fact, he had personally called the Deputy National Security Adviser \nto urge that the allegation be removed from the President's October \n2002 Cincinnati speech. Director Tenet was silent after the President \nincluded the allegation in his January 2003 State of the Union speech. \nIt was not until July of 2003, long after the war began, 2 months after \nPresident Bush declared major combat operations were over in Iraq, that \nDirector Tenet finally acknowledged publicly that the allegations \nshould not have been included in the State of the Union speech.\n  According to Bob Woodward's book ``Plan of Attack,'' when the \nPresident asked Director Tenet, following the CIA's presentation to him \nin December of 2002, about its intelligence relative to Iraq's \nsuspected WMD programs, How confident are you in the intelligence about \nthat, Director Tenet replied, ``Don't worry; it's a slam dunk,'' which \nit surely was not. But that is what the President wanted to hear. That \nis the message which Director Tenet presented to him, and that is the \nmessage that the President then presented to the American public.\n\n  It is essential that the new Director of the CIA stand up to the \nadministration in power, no matter what administration it is, when the \nintelligence does not support the direction that the administration \nwants to go. We cannot afford another Iraq intelligence fiasco.\n  General Hayden has said that he will be an independent CIA Director. \nBased on his record, I believe him.\n  One piece of evidence in that Hayden record relates to a strategy \nthat the administration used to bolster its case for war. The decision \nwas made by the administration to put a set of what was called ``fresh \neyes'' to look over the intelligence relative to the alleged links \nbetween Iraq and al-Qaida. The Secretary of Defense created a separate \noperation in a DOD policy office led by Douglas Feith. While the \nintelligence community was consistently dubious of the links between \nal-Qaida and Iraq, the Feith office scraped and scratched and cherry-\npicked the intelligence to produce assessments that said that there was \na strong relationship between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida. And then Mr. \nFeith bypassed the CIA, bypassed the intelligence community, and \nbriefed that analysis to senior policymakers at the National Security \nCouncil and the Vice President's office.\n  George Tenet told us that he was not aware of that prewar briefing by \nMr. Feith, until I brought it to his attention in February of 2004. In \nmaking its case for war with Iraq, the administration used Mr. Feith's \nmisleading intelligence to convince the country that Saddam and bin \nLaden were allies. There were few in the administration who had been \nwilling to speak up against this bypass of the intelligence community \nprocess, a process whose very purpose is to provide balanced, objective \nassessments for the intelligence community. One of the few who has \nspoken up is General Hayden.\n  At his nomination hearing, I asked General Hayden whether, when he \nwas NSA Director before the Iraq war, he was comfortable with what \nDouglas Feith was up to. My question to General Hayden was not just \nabout Doug Feith. It was about whether the General was willing to speak \nthe truth as he saw it, even if it went against the administration's \ncase for war. General Hayden told the committee, relative to the Feith \noperation:\n\n       No, sir. I wasn't comfortable.\n\n  Has anyone else in the administration said that, spoken up and said \nthat which is so obvious about the Feith operation?\n  There may be others, but General Hayden is the only one that comes to \nmind. This is what he then said to the committee at our hearing on his \nnomination:\n\n       It is possible, Senator, if you want to drill down on an \n     issue and just get laser beam focused, and exhaust every \n     possible--every ounce of evidence, you can build up a pretty \n     strong body of data, right? But you have to know what you're \n     doing, all right.\n       I got three great kids, but if you tell me go out and find \n     all the bad things they've done, Hayden, I can build you a \n     pretty good dossier, and you'd think they were pretty bad \n     people, because that was what I was looking for and that's \n     what I'd build up.\n\n  General Hayden said this:\n\n       That would be very wrong. That would be inaccurate. That \n     would be misleading.\n\n  Wrong, inaccurate, and misleading. That is a pretty good description \nof the Feith shop's prewar intelligence analysis. It is an indictment \nof the administration's use of that intelligence to make the case for \nwar.\n  But what is interesting, in particular, is not just what General \nHayden said at his confirmation hearing; it is what he did at the time \nthat the Feith office was actually out looking for intelligence to try \nto prove their premise that there was a connection between Saddam and \nal-Qaida. General Hayden actually placed a disclaimer on NSA reporting \nrelative to any links between al-Qaida and Saddam Hussein, stating that \nSIGINT--or signals intelligence--``neither confirms nor denies'' such a \nlink.\n  So while you had the administration claiming the link and Doug Feith \nscrapping around, scratching for any little bit of evidence that could \nprove his preordained conclusion that there was such a link, you had \nGeneral Hayden saying SIGINT, signals intelligence, neither confirms \nnor denies that such a link exists.\n  In other words, we have in General Hayden more than just promises of \nindependence and objectivity and a willingness to speak truth to power. \nWe have somebody who has actually done so.\n  There is another significant way in which General Hayden has spoken \ntruth to power. When we were considering reforming the intelligence \ncommunity to fill the gaps and the cracks that existed prior to 9/11 \nand the Iraq War, there was a major effort to derail the proposal, in \npart because the legislation sought to shift some authority from \nDepartment of Defense components to the new office of the Director of \nNational Intelligence. Although General Hayden is a four star general, \nhe stood up to Defense Secretary Rumsfeld on this issue. It took some \nbackbone and strength of character for him to do so.\n  As to General Hayden remaining in active duty if he is confirmed, I \nwould only make three points. One, he is not the first person to do so. \nSince the Central Intelligence Agency was established by law in 1947, \nthree commissioned officers have held the tile of Director of Central \nIntelligence, RADM Roscoe Hillenkoetter, GEN Walter Bedell Smith, and \nADM Stansfield Turner. I would also remind my colleagues that the \nSenate confirmed then LTG Colin Powell to be President Reagan's \nNational Security Adviser even though there is no law that removes that \nposition from the supervision or control of the Secretary of Defense.\n  Secondly, General Hayden has sent a letter to Senator Warner which \nstates ``I do not intend to remain in active military status beyond my \nassignment as Director, Central Intelligence Agency (if confirmed).'' \nThis is an added assurance of independence and that he will not be \nshaping intelligence to please the Defense Department in order to put \nhimself in a better position for some future appointment in the \nmilitary establishment.\n  Third, General Hayden's supervisor in his line of work as Director of \nthe CIA will be by law Ambassador Negroponte, not Secretary Rumsfeld. \nSo General Hayden would not be in the military chain of command but in \nthe intelligence chain of command.\n  To eliminate any doubt of that, we are including a provision in the \nDefense authorization bill, which is awaiting Senate floor action, to \nmake\n\n[[Page S5300]]\n\nthat absolutely clear in law. Senator Warner and I think it is already \nclear, but we are going to make it doubly clear by putting that into \nthe pending DOD authorization bill.\n  As I mentioned, the key issue relative to General Hayden's nomination \nis the President's domestic surveillance program. Over the past 6 \nmonths, we have been engaged in a national debate about the appropriate \nlimits on the Government's authority to conduct electronic \neavesdropping on American citizens.\n  General Hayden was Director of the National Security Agency when the \nPresident authorized the program, and many of our colleagues have \nraised concerns about that.\n  The administration has repeatedly characterized the electronic \nsurveillance program as applying only to international calls and not \ninvolving any domestic surveillance. In February, for instance, the \nVice President said:\n\n       Some of our critics call this a domestic surveillance \n     program. Wrong, that is inaccurate; it is not domestic \n     surveillance.\n\n  Ambassador Negroponte said:\n\n       This is a program that was ordered by the President with \n     respect to international phone calls to or from suspected al-\n     Qaida operatives and their affiliates . . . This was not \n     about domestic surveillance.\n\n  General Hayden found a way to signal that the administration has not \ndescribed the entire program. When asked at his confirmation hearing \nwhether the program the administration described is the entire program, \nGeneral Hayden said he could not answer in open session. Presumably, if \nit were the entire program, he could have easily answered, ``yes.''\n  In addition, while Stephen Hadley, the President's National Security \nAdviser, has said relative to the reports that phone records had been \nprovided to the Government under the NSA program, that it is hard to \nfind a privacy issue here, General Hayden did not make that claim and \ninstead acknowledged that, indeed, privacy was an issue, and surely \nwhatever one thinks they believe about this program, privacy is an \nissue.\n  There may be some who, when they understand the program, believe the \nprivacy concerns are overridden by the security advantage. There may be \nothers who reach the other conclusion that whatever security advantages \nare achieved do not overcome the privacy intrusions that are reported \nto exist by those phone records being in the possession or being \navailable to the Government, according to those press reports. But \nwhatever one's conclusion is, there are clearly privacy concerns \ninvolved. And when the general was in front of us--he was honest \nenough--and said: I cannot say there are no privacy concerns here, he \nwas telling us something which should be obvious to each one of us.\n  There are remaining for me a lot of unanswered questions about the \nNSA program, and I have been one who has been at least partially \nbriefed. I am one of that subcommittee of seven for whom the briefing \nhas begun. But the fact is, the legal opinions about this program are \nnot General Hayden's, they are the Attorney General's. I am aware of no \nallegation that General Hayden took any action that went beyond what \nthe President authorized or what the Attorney General advised was \nlegal. There are legitimate grounds for criticism regarding this \nprogram, but such criticism should be aimed at the White House and the \nAttorney General.\n  The Intelligence Committee is in the middle of an inquiry into the \nprogram. Now that the full committee has been authorized to be briefed \non the program, all of the members of the Intelligence Committee need \nto catch up to where seven of us are, which is about halfway through \nthe briefings. We are still waiting for the administration to answer \nmany questions that we have asked about the program.\n  I want to turn for a few moments to the issue of detainee treatment. \nI would have liked General Hayden to be more forthcoming on this issue \nat his hearing. In his testimony, General Hayden affirmed that the CIA \nis bound by the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005. In particular, General \nHayden stated that this legislation's prohibition on the cruel, \ninhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment of detainees applies to \nall Government agencies, including the CIA. The Detainee Treatment Act \nalso requires that no individual under the effective control of the \nDefense Department or in a DOD facility will be subjected to any \ninterrogation technique that is not listed in the Army Field Manual on \nIntelligence Interrogations. In response to my questioning, General \nHayden agreed that the Army field manual would apply to CIA \ninterrogations of detainees under DOD's effective control or in a DOD \nfacility.\n  I was disappointed, however, that General Hayden repeatedly chose not \nto 12 respond in public to many other questions on detainee treatment, \ndeferring his answers to the hearing's closed session. I believe that \nhe could have answered these questions and related his professional \nopinion in the public hearing.\n  In response to Senator Feinstein's questions, General Hayden would \nnot say publicly whether individuals held at secret sites may be \ndetained for decades. He would not say publicly whether waterboarding \nis an acceptable interrogation technique whether the Agency has \nreceived new legal guidance from the Department of Justice since \npassage of the Detainee Treatment Act in December of last year. General \nHayden would not answer my question whether the Justice Department memo \non the legality of specific interrogation techniques, referred to as \nthe second Bybee memo, remains operative, saying only that ``additional \nlegal opinions'' have been offered. The problem is exacerbated because \nthe administration continues to deny our requests for the second Bybee \nmemo and other Justice Department legal memos which set out the legal \nboundaries for what constitutes permissible treatment of detainees.\n  Under the Detainee Treatment Act, we have established a single \nstandard--no cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment of \ndetainees. This standard applies without regard to what agency holds a \ndetainee, whether the Defense Department or the CIA, or where the \ndetainee is being held. Yet the administration will not say publicly \nwhether this standard has the same meaning for the intelligence \ncommunity that it has for our military. The Government's views on the \nstandard for how we treat detainees remains cloaked in secrecy.\n  The Armed Services Committee has heard from the judge advocates \ngeneral of our military services on what they believe the standard for \ndetainee treatment is. The judge advocates general were asked about the \nuse of dogs in interrogations; forcing a detainee to wear women's \nunderwear during interrogation to humiliate him; leading a detainee \naround the room on all fours and forcing him to perform dog tricks; \nsubjecting a detainee to provocative touching to humiliate or demean \nhim; subjecting a detainee to strip searches and forcing him to stand \nnaked in front of females as an interrogation method; and \nwaterboarding. In each case, the judge advocates general said that such \ntreatment is not consistent with the spirit or intent of the Army fie1d \nmanual. As I mentioned earlier, with the enactment of the Detainee \nTreatment Act, the Army field manual applies to all interrogations of \ndetainees under the effective control of the Defense Department and all \ninterrogations conducted in DOD facilities.\n  General Hayden, in contrast, would not say in open session whether \neven waterboarding is even permitted. When the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee's markup of the national defense authorization bill for \nfiscal fear 2007 comes to the floor later this year, the Senate will \nhave the chance to demand some answers on the standard for the \ntreatment of detainees. The new bill includes a requirement that the \nPresident provide Congress a definitive legal opinion, coordinated \nacross government agencies, on whether certain specific interrogation \ntechniques--including waterboarding, sleep deprivation, stress \npositions, the use of dogs in interrogations and nudity or sexual \nhumiliation--constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or \npunishment under the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005. This provision \nwould also require the President to certify to Congress that this legal \nopinion is binding on all departments and agencies of the U.S. \nGovernment, including the CIA, their personnel, and their contractors.\n  While I disagree with General Hayden's decision not to publicly state \nhis\n\n[[Page S5301]]\n\npersonal view, the general did affirm that the prohibition on cruel, \ninhuman, or degrading treatment in the Detainee Treatment Act applies \nto all Government agencies, including the CIA.\n  We have asked the administration to clarify this matter. I would hope \nthat the administration would, one, state clearly that waterboarding, \nsleep deprivation, and stress positions are unacceptable; two, state \nclearly that the standard in law prohibits the use of dogs in \ninterrogations; and three, state clearly that acts like stripping a \ndetainee for interrogation purposes or subjecting a detainee to sexual \nhumiliation are prohibited. I also hope that the administration will \nstate clearly that the International Committee of the Red Cross will be \ninformed about all detainees held by the United States Government and \nadopt a policy of not rendering individuals in our custody where there \nis a reasonable possibility that the person will be tortured.\n  As I said at the time the Senate approved the Detainee Treatment Act, \nenactment of this legislation means the United States has rejected any \nclaim that this standard--cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or \npunishment--has one meaning for the Department of Defense and another \nfor the CIA--one meaning as applied to Americans and another applied to \nour enemies, or one meaning as applied on U.S. territory and another \napplied elsewhere in the world.\n  I conclude by saying, in my view, General Hayden will be the \nindependent Director of the Central Intelligence Agency that we so \ndesperately need and that the country deserves. The record demonstrates \nhis willingness to speak truth to power, and I will vote to confirm \nGeneral Hayden.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/25/senate-section/article/S5301-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 8:45 A.M.
