Mr. President, this afternoon, the order provides for \nresuming debate on the supplemental appropriations bill. I believe \nafter the remarks of the two leaders, there are a couple of Senators, \nincluding our distinguished President pro tempore, who desire to speak \non other subjects. The chairman will then be ready to resume debate on \nthe pending emergency supplemental bill. I remind all Senators that I \nfiled a cloture motion on the bill last week and that vote will occur \ntomorrow morning. In accordance with that cloture motion, all first-\ndegree amendments should be filed at the desk by 2:30 this afternoon. \nWe already have a large number of pending amendments that will need to \nbe disposed of. If we are able to invoke cloture on the bill tomorrow \nmorning, then it is my expectation to finish the bill no later than \nWednesday of this week. Therefore, we will have rollcall votes each day \nof this week as we complete work on this appropriations bill.\n  Our first rollcall vote this week will occur this afternoon at 5:30. \nWe will have a vote on a district judge who was reported by the \nJudiciary Committee last week. This week we may also consider the tax \nrelief extension conference report, if that conference report becomes \navailable. There is a 10-hour statutory limit on that measure, and we \nwill begin debate under that time limit as soon as that conference \nreport arrives from the House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/01/senate-section/article/S3769-7", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3769-S3770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, over the weekend, we got more bad news on \nthe rising price of gas. Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman told us to \nexpect high gas prices to continue for 2 to 3 more years. In his words, \nsuppliers have lost control of the market.\n  Every day drivers are getting socked with higher and higher prices at \nthe pump and in some places gas prices are well over $3 per gallon. \nWorse yet, the situation only threatens to intensify as those summer \ndriving months come into view.\n  Consumers are understandably frustrated. They are worried. For most \nfamilies, gas is a basic necessity, and rising gas prices simply put \nthem over a barrel. They need a break. The Republican leadership is \ndelivering a plan.\n  Last Thursday, we unveiled our proposal to offer immediate short-term \nrelief for American consumers, as well as a broader strategy to \nincrease America's energy supply and to reduce our demand for oil.\n  We propose giving taxpayers a $100 gas tax holiday rebate check so \ntheir hard-earned money goes back into their pockets instead of into \ntheir gas tanks.\n  We also want to make sure consumers are protected against any price \ngouging or anticompetitive behavior by oil companies or other suppliers \nof energy. Our proposal includes strong Federal antiprice-gouging \nprotection.\n  These are two steps we can take right now to offer the consumer \nimmediate relief. But for the midterm and for the long term, we need to \nget to the root of what is driving oil prices through the roof: basic \nsupply and demand. We don't have enough domestic oil to meet our energy \nneeds, and that global demand is growing day by day.\n\n  In order to get control of the problem, we need to increase domestic \nsupplies, supplies at home, and we need to diversify our energy \nsources.\n  The package we have introduced promotes the development of \nalternative fuels in the use of hybrids and other advanced technology \nvehicles. It also gives Secretary Mineta the authority to issue a rule \nlooking at fuel economy standards for passenger cars.\n  These two measures address the demand side of the equation, but we \nalso must address the supply side. If President Clinton had not vetoed \nANWR a decade ago, ANWR today would be producing a million barrels of \noil each and every day right now. A million barrels of supply each day \nwould be coming to\n\n[[Page S3770]]\n\nthe continent. That is about three-fourths of what we currently import \nfrom all of Saudi Arabia.\n  We need to open a portion of the Reserve to environmentally sensitive \nexploration and get that oil to the market. There is no question that \ntapping into this domestic resource will bring down oil prices.\n  We also need to expand our refinery capacity. It is amazing, we have \nnot built a new refinery in the United States in over 30 years. It is \nnext to impossible to expand an existing one today.\n  One reason why gas prices are so high right now is that several \nrefineries are still offline in the wake of Katrina. Several others \ndeferred maintenance to help after the hurricane are performing \nmaintenance now, still at lower than pre-Katrina levels.\n  Adding refinery capacity will help to increase gasoline supplies and \nlower prices at the pump. Our plan takes important steps in this \ndirection.\n  We all know America is dangerously dependent on foreign sources of \noil. This dependence compromises our economic and national security. \nLast summer, after a decade of partisan obstruction, Congress passed a \ncomprehensive Energy bill that goes a long way toward addressing this \ngrave problem. We double the amount of ethanol and biodiesel in our \ngasoline. By 2012, this should reduce oil consumption by 80,000 barrels \na day.\n  We passed a hybrid car tax credit of up to $3,400 per vehicle.\n  The Energy bill also allocated significant funding for research and \ndevelopment of hydrogen fuel cells. If just 20 percent of our cars used \nfuel cell technology, we could cut oil imports by 1.5 million barrels a \nday.\n  We need to build on these initiatives and encourage American \nconsumers, producers, and entrepreneurs to think beyond oil. I believe, \nas does the President, that America's future lies with technology that \nwill allow Americans to use environmentally safe and diverse energy \nsources. America will be safer, America will be more secure with \nAmerican energy coming from American sources.\n  We presented a strong package that will give consumers relief at the \npump and will bring down the high cost of gas. I am hopeful we will \nvote on this package in the coming days. Filling up the tank shouldn't \nbreak the bank.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/01/senate-section/article/S3770-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I see my two colleagues in the Chamber, the \ndistinguished Senators from Tennessee and Louisiana, and I see my \nfriend from New Mexico here. I have a statement to give. It will take a \nfew minutes to complete. I apologize, but that is what I have to do. I \nguess I should make an inquiry. How long are the Senators going to \nspeak?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Five minutes.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from New Mexico, it looks like he is loaded for \nbear there.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have an amendment I am going to \nintroduce on the pending bill. I will not speak longer than 5 minutes \non the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I can wait and do my speech after that, if \nthat would be OK with my colleagues. It is just a matter of trying to \nbe nice to people. So I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from New \nMexico be recognized--or the Senator from Tennessee be recognized \nfirst, the Senator from Louisiana second, and the Senator from New \nMexico, the chairman of the Energy Committee, my dear friend, be \nrecognized for 5 minutes and following that, I would have the floor and \nbe able to start my speech and finish it.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would \nlike to just make the suggestion through the Chair that the Senator \nfrom New Mexico go second and I proceed third.\n  Mr. REID. No objection.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I know we put together a time line. \nSenator Kennedy would also like to be recognized. He can follow Senator \nReid, but I think he would like to be recognized for 30 minutes \nfollowing the four Senators we have in the queue.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, is morning business allocated this morning?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. No.\n  Mr. REID. So what the Senator from Washington has asked is that \nfollowing my statement, the Senator from Massachusetts be recognized \nfor 30 minutes. My statement is going to take a little bit of time, and \nif there is a Republican speaker who wants to come after me, that would \nbe what should happen, and then Senator Kennedy can be recognized after \nthat. Is that appropriate? So I ask that following my statement, the \nSenator from Alaska be recognized.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Myself and Senator Inouye for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. And following that, Senator Kennedy be recognized for 30 \nminutes. So Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens for 10 minutes each. So \nafter 15 minutes, I will speak, and then it will be Senator Inouye and \nSenator Stevens, and then following that it will be Senator Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Democratic leader for his \ncourtesy. This will permit me to chair a hearing at 2:30 on time. I \nthank the chairman of the Energy Committee and the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  May I ask the Chair to inform me when there is 30 seconds remaining \nof my 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will be notified.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/01/senate-section/article/S3770-4", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3770-S3771]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SINGING OF THE NATIONAL ANTHEM\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, across the country today, thousands of \nimmigrants, legal and illegal, are marching in a nationwide rally. Many \nare saying that they, too, want to become Americans.\n  But I am afraid the message is quite literally getting lost in \ntranslation. As part of these demonstrations, a new version of our \nnational anthem, ``The Star-Spangled Banner,'' has been produced--in \nSpanish.\n  According to an article in the Washington Post on last Friday, at \nleast 389 different versions of our anthem have been produced over the \nyears in many musical styles, including rock and roll and country, but \nthe Post also noted that never before has it been rendered in another \nlanguage. This may be a first, but it is a big first step in the wrong \ndirection. It is a mistake precisely because our Nation is a nation of \nimmigrants.\n  Almost all of us are descended from immigrants from Britain or \nGermany or Italy or France or China or Mexico or some other country \naround the world. Our forefathers who came from these many different \ncountries spoke\n\n[[Page S3771]]\n\nmany different languages, but in coming here they agreed to speak one \ncommon language, one language to unify us as a nation, one language so \nwe can all speak with one another. And that language is English. In \nfact, in order for a legal immigrant to become a citizen of the United \nStates, one requirement is that he or she demonstrate at least an \neighth grade level understanding of the English language.\n  A century and a half ago, we created common schools--the public \nschools--so that mostly immigrant children could learn English, learn \nhow to write and read in English as well as to do math, and learn what \nit meant to be an American with the hope they would go home and teach \ntheir parents. Only 2 weeks ago, this Senate encouraged the speaking of \nEnglish by saying that it would knock a year off the waiting time to \nbecome a citizen if an applicant became proficient in English and \nauthorizing $500 grants for people who are legally here who are seeking \nto become citizens. So for a long time, we have recognized that English \nis a part of who we are as Americans. It is a part of what unites us, \njust as we are united by our history and our shared values, such as \nliberty, equal opportunity, and the rule of law.\n  I worry that translating our national anthem will actually have the \neffect of dividing us. It adds to the celebration of multiculturalism \nin our society which has eroded our understanding of our American \nculture. Ours is a diverse nation, proudly diverse, but diversity is \nnot our greatest accomplishment. Jerusalem is diverse. The Balkans are \ndiverse. Iraq is diverse. What makes America unique is that we have \ntaken all that magnificent diversity and turned it into one nation. \nTranslating our anthem into multiple languages also erodes our sense of \nhaving a common language that allows us to speak with one another as \none nation. Our national anthem is a symbol of all of those things \nwhich unite us. It is a product of our history.\n  ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' was written by Francis Scott Key in \n1814. Our Nation was then in the midst of the War of 1812. On \nSeptember, 13, 1814, just a few weeks after the invasion of Washington, \nBritish forces began a 25-hour bombardment of Fort McHenry in \nBaltimore. Through the day and all through the night, the rockets and \nbombs flew. And the next day, on September 14, standing aboard an \nAmerican ship 8 miles out from Baltimore, Francis Scott Key looked and \nsaw the stars and stripes were still waving over the fort, and the \nBritish were forced to withdraw. Our flag was still there.\n  I went to see that very same flag a few months ago at the \nSmithsonian's National Museum of American History. The museum is in the \nprocess of carefully preserving it so that our grandchildren's \ngrandchildren will be able to see the original flag that inspired our \nnational anthem. That flag and song are part of our history and our \nnational identity.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. It declares some of our national ideals, in being \n``the land of the free and the home of the brave.''\n  That is why we should always sing it in our common language: English. \nAnd that is why today I will introduce, along with Senator Frist, \nSenator McConnell, and Senators Stevens and Isakson and Roberts, and I \nhope others, a resolution that affirms that statements of national \nunity, especially the Pledge of Allegiance and the national anthem, \nought to be recited in English. We wouldn't recite the pledge in French \nor German or Russian or Hindi or even Chinese, which, after Spanish, is \nthe second most spoken foreign language in the United States, and we \nshouldn't sing the national anthem in Spanish or any other foreign \nlanguage.\n  So in conclusion, in this land of immigrants, let's sing it together \nas one American Nation in our common language: English.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski.) The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his inquiry.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Madam President, I note the presence now of the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee.\n  I will take as little time as possible, and I know of no reason for \nthis amendment to take a lot of time, but I want to make sure everybody \nknows it is pending, and that is why I put it here, and I plan to offer \nit now. It is a very important amendment with reference to the \nreconstruction of the levee system.\n  I will quickly show three photographs.\n  One, the photo that is up here right now shows the floodwall breach \nat the 17th Street Canal. As you can see, the storm surge pushed the \nfloodwall out of alignment. The corresponding photograph shows repairs \nto the 17th Street Canal floodwall as of February 2006.\n  This one shows the repairs and, believe it or not, that is what has \nbeen done already, Mr. Chairman, in the short time since the disastrous \nbreak, and it looks like that now.\n  Third, this photo shows the failure of an I-wall section of the \nlevee. The President has requested that we replace I-walls with \nstronger and more substantial T-walls. These I-walls fell down all over \nparts of the area, letting water come through as they fell down, and \nbecame more like waterways rather than water containers.\n  That is what we are replacing, and we are replacing them with what is \nshown in a fourth photograph I have here, which shows work taking place \nelsewhere in the area. The amendment I am submitting in behalf of the \nPresident is going to authorize this kind of construction occur in an \narea described in the amendment.\n  This is the construction of T-walls along the inner harbor navigation \ncanal. The foreground shows the reinforcing steel that goes into these \nT-wall sections driven into the ground at an angle. The T-wall is then \ncast in place on top of the pilings. With this, we will have as strong \na containment as can be expected and can be done, according to the \nexperts.\n  We will take this photograph down because we don't need to have this \nup while speeches are given.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3769\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 3769 and ask \nthat it be considered immediately.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3769.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, the amendment has been made available \nto the other side.\n  The President of the United States, after consultation with the man \nhe placed in charge of this program, the project of renewal, and with \nthe Corps of Engineers' leadership, has asked us for $1.46 billion. An \nadditional $2.2 billion is requested in this amendment, and that makes \nthe total $3.7 billion. Previous supplemental funds provided last year \nenable restoration of current levee systems to the authorized strength \nas well as to complete the system as originally envisioned. The \nproposed supplemental funding takes us to the next logical step in this \nrebuilding process. The requested funding will provide for the \nimprovement to the obvious weaknesses in the existing levee system. \nThese include, $1.6 billion for replacement of I-wall design that \nfailed during Hurricane Katrina with better designed, stronger flood \nwalls; $530 million for temporary closure of the interior drainage \ncanal, with permanent closure and integrated pumping stations; $250 \nmillion for storm-proofing of interior pump stations; $170 million for \narmoring critical elements of the levee system; and $350 million for \nnavigable closures to improve protection of the inner harbor navigation \ncanal.\n  The requested funding will also allow for increased protection from \nstorm surges. These improvements include $215 million to incorporate \nthe West Bank levee in Plaquemines Parish into the Federal levee. That \nwill incorporate it into the levee system and upgrade the levee to the \nFederal standards; $100 million for restoration of coastal wetlands to \nreduce the risk of storm surge. And $493 million for increasing the \nlevee heights of Lake Pontchartrain and Vicinity project and the West \nBank and Vicinity project. These levee improvements will be a cost \nshared with the State of Louisiana, and everybody understands that. \nBased on the vulnerabilities demonstrated to our Nation's \ninfrastructure by Katrina, $20 million is included for an inventory and \nassessment of Federal and non-Federal flood and storm damage projects \nnationwide. Currently, no reliable information is available to \ndetermine reliable flood risks across the country; $25 million is \nincluded for studies of the Louisiana coastal area to determine how \nbest to provide long-term comprehensive restoration of coastal \nwetlands, to reduce storm surge in the New Orleans and south Louisiana \nareas.\n\n  In addition to the President's request, we have also provided \nadditional funding for other emergency and disaster-related recovery \nefforts in California, Hawaii, Pennsylvania, and Texas. All of the \nfunding proposed above the President's request is provided subject to a \nspecific request from the President designating it as an emergency. \nWithout an official Presidential request, these funds cannot be used.\n  In February 2006, the President submitted a request for supplemental \nappropriations for the Army Corps of Engineers totaling $1.46 billion. \nThe funds will provide increased protection to obvious weaknesses in \nthe New Orleans levee system and will improve storm proofing of \ninterior pumping capabilities within the city to mitigate flooding.\n  Prior to Hurricane Katrina, FEMA had initiated a reevaluation of the \n100-year flood plain in the New Orleans and other gulf coast areas. \nPost Katrina, the analysis was revised to include Katrina impacts. The \nrevised 100-year flood plain maps show the existing levee system will \nnot provide 100-year protection. These new flood plain maps will have a \ntremendous impact on where and how redevelopment of New Orleans can \noccur.\n  Additionally, the Corps has determined that roughly 36 miles of the \n56 miles of I-walls that are part of the levee system protecting the \ngreater New Orleans metro area should be replaced with more stable T-\nWalls or L-Walls as a result of the I-Wall failures during Hurricane \nKatrina.\n  Due to the need to bring some rationality and stability to the \nredevelopment of New Orleans, the administration submitted a revised \nrequest to provide 100-year level of protection to New Orleans proper. \nThe request specifically excludes improvements to roughly 8 miles of I-\nWalls in lower Plaquemines Parish and increasing levee heights in lower \nPlaquemines Parish to provide 100-year level of protection.\n  Raising the height of the levees will improve the level of protection \nto New Orleans proper and allow for continued participation in the \nNational Flood Insurance Program administered by FEMA.\n  On April 25, the administration requested an additional $2.2 billion \nfor the following:\n  $1.6 billion for replacing I-walls with T-walls or L-Walls in New \nOrleans--roughly 30 miles. Replacing the I-walls with stronger T-Walls \nor L-Walls is necessary to improve the performance of the levee system \ndue to the failure of the I-Walls during Katrina;\n  $495.3 million for the Federal share of raising the levee height in \nNew Orleans to the newly determined 100-year flood plain level. The \ncurrent cost share mandated by 33 U.S.C. 2213 requires a 35 percent \nlocal cost share;\n  $215 million for incorporating certain non-Federal levees by \nreplacing or modifying these existing levees on the west bank of the \nMississippi River in\n\n[[Page S3774]]\n\nPlaquemines Parish. Incorporating, replacing or modifying these non-\nFederal levees will provide a hurricane protection system commensurate \nwith the level of protection authorized for the Federal New Orleans to \nVenice hurricane protection project in order to protect the evacuation \nroute. This is an increase above the original February request of $155 \nmillion.\n  The President's original $1.46 billion request will provide critical \nstorm protection to New Orleans and is still necessary despite the new \nrequest. The February request includes the following:\n  $530,000,000 is provided to modify the 17th Street, Orleans Avenue \nand London Avenue drainage canals, and install pumps and closure \nstructures at or near the lakefront. The closure structures will help \nprevent storm surge from Lake Pontchartrain from entering the canals, \nand the new pumping stations will convey water from the canals to the \nlake;\n  $350,000,000 is provided to improve protection at the Inner Harbor \nNavigation Canal. The Corps will construct two closure structures, one \nat Seabrook where the IHNC enters Lake Pontchartrain and another on the \nGulf Intracoastal Waterway;\n  $250,000,000 will be used for storm-proofing interior pump stations \nto ensure their operability during hurricanes, storms and high water \nevents. Storm-proofing measures will provide more protection against \nhurricane force winds, storm surge and inundation so the drainage pumps \nand equipment can remain operable during hurricanes, storms, and high \nwater events;\n  $170,000,000 shall be used for armoring critical elements of the New \nOrleans hurricane and storm damage reduction system. Armoring will be \nselectively used on levees and floodwalls at critical portions of the \nNew Orleans hurricane and storm damage reduction system, including \nstructural transition points such as pipeline crossings or junctures \nbetween levees and floodwalls; floodwalls susceptible to scour and \nerosion; and certain sections of levees exposed to extreme surge and \nwave wash;\n  $100 million to the Corps of Engineers to reduce the risk of storm \ndamage to greater New Orleans by restoring the surrounding wetlands.\n  Since the President has revised his request following Appropriations \nCommittee action, a floor amendment is necessary to accommodate the \nadditional funding. The amendment will provide the following:\n  General Investigation--$48.75 million to support investigations of \nnationwide flood project inventory, Louisiana coastal area ecosystem \nrestoration studies, Delta Islands and Levee studies in CA, developing \na Delta risk management strategy in CA and for flood hazard and \nhydrologic investigations in flood prone areas of HI;\n\n  $595.3 million for levee raising and wetland restoration;\n  $3.1 billion for I-wall replacement; drainage canal improvements; \nstorm proofing pumps; and armoring of levees.\n  The committee was aware the administration was considering a change \nin the request and tied to accommodate the President based on the \noriginal request. The committee provided $624 million in added funding, \nsubject to request by the President. However, the new request \nsignificantly expands the scope of work and will require new language.\n  Amendments adopted in committee have been included as well--subject \nto the same terms and conditions.\n  As to Corps action to date, in the second supplemental $400 million \nfor immediate disaster response to Katrina; $200 million for dredging \noperations and $200 million to repair existing projects.\n  In the third supplemental the President's request was $1.6 billion. \nCongress provided $2.89 billion--$1.3 billion above the request for \nrecovery efforts from all fiscal year 2005 hurricanes. Of the amount \nprovided in the third supplemental, about $1.9 billion went to LA.\n  In the fourth supplemental, $3.6 billion total:\n  In the first request, $1.46 billion for levee upgrades and flood \nmitigation activities in New Orleans;\n  In the second request, $2.2 billion to raise levee height, replace I-\nwalls with T-walls.\n  To date, the administration and Congress have aggressively addressed \nhurricane damage to provide a higher level of protection for New \nOrleans and southeast Louisiana.\n  The Corps is working to restore hurricane protection for the start of \nhurricane season, on June 1, 2006.\n  The Corps is completing new sections of storm protection that were \nnot in place when Katrina struck.\n  The latest request increases levee height in New Orleans to provide \n100-year storm level protection, based on FEMA's new 100-year flood \nplain elevations, and improves flood mitigation capabilities within New \nOrleans to prevent severe flooding that occurred as a result of \nKatrina.\n  The Corps continues to evaluate existing structures to determine weak \npoints and study and recommend necessary storm protection measures \nsoutheast Louisiana as provided in the third supplemental. The Corps \nshould have initial recommendations by June 2006 with additional \nsolutions provided over the next year. This information will be used to \nmake informed decisions about future storm protection measures.\n  I believe we make our case. I do not think we have to talk more.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask that the Chair advise me when I \nhave 45 seconds of my time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. VITTER. I rise in strong support of the amendment of the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, who chairs the crucial subcommittee under which all of \nthese vital corps projects fall. I thank the Senator from New Mexico \nfor his leadership on this crucial issue. This is an absolutely \nessential amendment, and in supporting it, I wish to stress a few \nitems.\n  First of all, everything the Senator has outlined, everything in his \namendment was specifically requested by the President of the United \nStates and was given by the President the top priority possible. \nSecondly, we are debating a number of issues on the floor as to this \nhurricane relief bill, and some are being cut out and others are being \nadded, those at the margin. This amendment is not at the margin in any \nway, shape or form. This is at the heart of this hurricane relief bill \nbecause it goes to essential hurricane flood protection for the \ncitizens of south Louisiana.\n  So I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his leadership and \ncertainly strongly support the amendment.\n  Now, Madam President, I would like to call up a separate but related \namendment which I have filed at the desk, amendment No. 3728.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will abstain while the clerk \nretrieves the amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to consideration of the \namendment at this time.\n  Mr. VITTER. It is my understanding that the amendment has been filed; \nis that not the case?\n  Madam President, if I could suggest that I move on and speak about \nthe amendment, and then perhaps we can formally call it up when it \narrives at the desk, if that would be appropriate.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I have no objection to the Senator \ntalking to his amendment, but at this time, we will object to his \ncalling it up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Since there are pending amendments, it does \ntake consent to call it up.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, if I could ask unanimous consent to \nspeak 2 minutes on the Domenici amendment at whatever time is \nappropriate before we leave that amendment and go on to anything else.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Louisiana does have \nthe floor at this time.\n  Mr. VITTER. I have no objection, if it doesn't come out of my time \nand everyone is agreeable to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Louisiana for 2 minutes?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague from Louisiana \nbecause I know that there are many important amendments that we have to\n\n[[Page S3775]]\n\nconsider relative to this major piece of legislation, which of course, \nis the supplemental for not just Katrina, Rita, and the gulf coast but \nalso for our troops overseas and the situation in Iraq.\n  I thank, again, Senator Cochran and also Senator Byrd for their \nleadership in moving this supplemental forward on such a critical \nissue. I thank Senator Domenici and Senator Reid, as chairman and \nranking member, respectively, of the Energy and Water Committee, \nbecause in working with the administration, they have fashioned an \namendment that will provide for Louisiana an additional $2 billion for \ncritical levee infrastructure. As we rebuild New Orleans, the greater \nNew Orleans area, south Louisiana and the gulf coast, getting \nadditional funding for restructuring, rebuilding, and strengthening of \nthe levee system around New Orleans and south Louisiana is essential. \nThis $2 billion amendment will, in fact, do that.\n  I thank Senator Cochran for his willingness to add this $2 billion to \nthe supplemental, to help us to secure the critical funds necessary to \nfinish a project, which, of course, was promised on the heels of \nKatrina and the great flood that levied 20 feet of water in some areas \ninto the city of New Orleans, and it continues our ongoing efforts, \nMadam President, to secure not just the city but the metropolitan area \nof Plaquemines, Jefferson, Saint Tammany, and Saint Charles, parishes \nthat are the greater New Orleans area--Terrebonne, Plaquemines Parish \nand places to the west.\n  So I join my colleague from Louisiana in supporting this amendment \nand thank the bipartisan leadership that has come together to support \nit. And then we will have a series of other amendments that help \nimprove the underlying bill. I thank my colleagues for the time to \nspeak on the Domenici amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank the Chair. And I appreciate all of those words by \nmy colleague from Louisiana and certainly join her in all of those \ncomments.\n\n  Now, if I could briefly outline amendment 3728, which has not been \ncalled up, but I will outline what it does. Again, the Domenici \namendment is crucially necessary for levy and hurricane protection work \nin south Louisiana. Amendment 3728 would simply supplement that in \nrelatively small ways in terms of dollar amounts but in very important \nways.\n  At the outset, before I explain what it covers, let me explain three \ncrucial overall points about the amendment.\n  No. 1, all of the moneys or funds or expenditures in this amendment \n3728 are completely offset so it does not increase the size or the cost \nof the bill whatsoever.\n  No. 2, everything covered in the amendment was actually included in \nthe underlying bill at the committee stage of the process. It has been \nremoved as it comes to the floor, but it was included in committee and \nthe chairman of the subcommittee, the Senator from New Mexico, has no \nobjection to the inclusion of these important items. In addition, the \nstatement of administration policy on the bill, while it highlights a \nnumber of items the administration actually opposes in the bill, does \nnot highlight any of the items in this amendment. The administration \nhas not expressed opposition to these items.\n  And No. 3, all of the operation and maintenance required for these \nitems in my amendment is funded 100 percent by the locals, by the local \nsponsors of these projects.\n  Basically, it covers five crucial things.\n  No. 1, addressing further damaged, destroyed or inferior protection \nlevees in south Louisiana. While the Domenici amendment addresses many \nof those needs, all of these areas where there is a blue rectangle \ngiving the new heights of the levee protection system, after the work \nin the Domenici amendment is completed, there are, unfortunately, a few \ngaps in this area of Lafourche, Terrebonne, and also the east bank of \nPlaquemines Parish. And this amendment would help fill those gaps.\n  No. 2, fulfilling shortfalls in funding for full pumping capacity \nneeds in Jefferson and Orleans Parishes with the closing of outfall \ncanals.\n  No. 3, meeting shortfalls to ensure equal levels of hurricane \nprotection on the east and west banks of the Mississippi River in lower \nPlaquemines Parish, again, one of the slight gaps I pointed to on the \nmap.\n  No. 4, providing a plan to protect lower Plaquemines parish for the \nlong-term and vital resources in that Parish--energy and seafood and \nmaritime.\n  And No. 5, the amendment would direct the national academies to \nperform a study to determine that portion of the levy system that lost \nheight due to construction, design, subsidence, and settlement.\n  In closing, Madam President, again, let me emphasize that everything \nin this amendment No. 3728 is offset, that everything in it was \nincluded by the committee during committee deliberations and is not \nopposed in the statement of administration policy and that everything \nin it, operation and maintenance related to these works, would be \nfunded 100 percent by the local sponsors of these important works. I \nurge all of my colleagues, Republican and Democrat, to support my \namendment. It does not increase the size of the bill, it merely \nperfects, if you will, the very important work being done by the \nDomenici amendment.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I rise for 20 seconds to ask unanimous consent to add \nmy name as a cosponsor to the amendment of my colleague. He and I offer \nthis together as a way to keep these five important projects alive for \nfurther discussion, and as he said, all the operation and maintenance \nwill be picked up at the local level. So I thank our colleagues for \ntheir consideration this morning, for giving us time to speak about \nthis important amendment, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Democratic leader is recognized.\n\n\n                       Honoring our Armed Forces\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, T. Byers of Sparks, NV, was killed in Iraq \non July 23, 2003, when his convoy hit an explosive device. He was 25 \nyears old.\n  William Salazar of Las Vegas, 26 years old, was killed in Iraq on \nOctober 15, 2004, in enemy action.\n  John Lukac of Las Vegas was just 19 years old when he was killed in \nIraq on October 30, 2004, when a bomb hit his car.\n  Nicholas Anderson of Las Vegas, again, Madam President, only 19 years \nold, was killed during an assault on Fallujah on November 12, 2004.\n  Daniel Guastaferro, also of Las Vegas, 27 years old, died in Iraq on \nJanuary 7, 2005.\n  Richard Perez of Las Vegas, again, fresh out of school, 19 years old, \ndied in Iraq on February 10, 2005.\n  Eric Morris of Sparks, 31 years old, was killed on April 28, 2005, \nwhen a roadside bomb exploded.\n  Stanley Lapinski, 35 years old, was killed in Iraq on June 11, 2005, \nby a makeshift bomb in Baghdad.\n  James Jaime of Henderson, NV, 22 years old, was killed in Iraq on \nJune 15, 2005, when a bomb exploded near his vehicle.\n  Anthony S.

Misner II, from Sparks, 23 years old, was killed in Iraq on \nFebruary 22, 2006, by an improvised explosive device.\n  Shawn Thomas Lasswell, Jr., of Reno, 21 years old, was killed by an \nimprovised explosive device on April 23, 2006, just a few days ago.\n  These are the names of the 16 Nevadans who have been killed in \nOperation Iraqi Freedom since May 1, 2003. I never met these men but, \nto me, they are Nevada's heroes. They are our Nation's heroes.\n  In 1944, an American President said:\n\n       Older men declare war. But it is youth that must fight and \n     die. And it is youth who must\n\n[[Page S3776]]\n\n     inherit the tribulation, the sorrow and the triumphs that are \n     the aftermath of war.\n\n  Many years and many wars later, this quote rings true. These 16 young \nNevadans gave their lives for our country. These boys--these young \nmen--left families and ofttimes their babies and children as they \ntraveled across the ocean and seas to soldier in deserts and cities far \nfrom home.\n  Most of these men were living their childhood dreams of serving in \nthe military of the United States. Others were using the military as a \nstepping stone. Whatever the reason for their joining this volunteer \nfighting force, we can never repay their sacrifice, but we will always \nremember their ultimate sacrifice.\n  To their families, to the families of all 2,404 U.S. troops who have \nfallen in Iraq, and to the thousands of families who have loved ones \nserving there now, our thoughts and prayers are with you. I know you \nare proud of your sons and daughters, and I am confident our Nation's \npeople are also proud of them. Their exemplary patriotism, dedication, \nand competence speaks volumes.\n  I mention our troops and these fallen Nevadans for a reason. Today, \nour country marks an unfortunate anniversary: the 3-year anniversary of \nPresident Bush's donning a flight suit to declare ``Mission \nAccomplished'' in Iraq.\n  President Bush's dramatic landing on the aircraft carrier Abraham \nLincoln will be marked historically as a public relations stunt gone \nhorribly wrong.\n  Since President Bush rendered his judgment of ``Mission \nAccomplished,'' more than 2,200 American military are now dead, about \n20,000 have since been wounded, many hundreds of billions of dollars of \ntaxpayers' money expended, and now Iraq is engaged in a civil war, the \ndegree of which is unknown and debatable.\n  The image of President Bush standing in front of the ``Mission \nAccomplished'' banner has been etched into the minds of the American \npeople as a metaphor for the Bush White House's misleading and \ndangerous incompetence. It shows a self-described ``war President'' not \nready for the war or the difficult problems of securing the peace, the \nproblems the President and his Secretary of Defense simply ignored or \ndid not understand following the invasion of Iraq.\n  On this date 3 years ago, President Bush announced: ``Major combat \noperations in Iraq have ended.''\n  Let me repeat that quote.\n  Three years ago today, the President said on the aircraft carrier \nwith his flight suit on: ``Major combat operations in Iraq have \nended.''\n  He said further that ``in the battle of Iraq, the United States and \nour allies have prevailed.''\n  Here it is, 156 weeks later, with fighting and violence continuing \nacross Iraq. We know that declaration was woefully premature. In fact, \nthe President and his team's mismanagement and poor planning have now \nstretched the Iraq war to a length and monetary cost that matches that \nof World War II.\n  On that day 3 years go, President Bush also said ``a special word for \nSecretary Rumsfeld--that America is grateful for a job well done.''\n  Three years later, the debate is not whether Rumsfeld has carried out \na job well done but whether he is even the man for the job. Eight \nretired generals and millions of Americans have called for him to be \nreplaced as Secretary of Defense.\n  We know that Secretary Rumsfeld ignored the advice of the uniformed \nmilitary and went into battle with too few troops and no plan to win \nthe peace. As a result, the insurgency was able to gain a foothold, and \nnow civil and sectarian strife threatens our troops and our future and \nthe future of Iraq.\n  Friday we learned that four-star general and former Secretary of \nState Colin Powell told the President and Secretary Rumsfeld that the \nnumber of troops for the invasion was inadequate. General Colin Powell \ntold the President and Secretary Rumsfeld that there were not enough \ntroops to prevail. He was ignored.\n  Returning to this picture, President Bush also said on that day, in \nIraq, ``we've removed an ally of al-Qaida,'' and, I further quote, ``we \nhave seen the turning of the tide'' in the war on terror. The troops \nprevailed, yes. But provisions for peace were never made.\n  On April 17 of this year--a few days ago--the same day one of these \ngallant Nevadans was killed, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld \nsaid--listen to this:\n\n       The implication that there was something wrong with the war \n     plan is amusing almost.\n\n  Amusing? Amusing, Mr. Secretary? Really?\n  How unfortunate. A failed plan with failed, manipulated intelligence \ntaking us to war.\n  But here we are, 156 weeks later, 5,072 days later, the intractable \nwar in Iraq and the war on terror rages on as never before. April was \nthe deadliest month for Americans in Iraq this year. Over 70 of our \nbrave soldiers have been killed.\n  The war on terror has also moved in the wrong direction. According to \nthe State Department, the number of terrorist attacks has risen sharply \naround the world. More than 11,000 terrorist attacks occurred worldwide \nlast year--a 250 percent increase from the year before. Iraq--a country \nwhere Osama bin Laden had few inroads before the war--has become a \ntraining ground and launching pad for international terrorism.\n  According to the State Department, it is now a ``foreign fighter \npipeline'' to terror. While the security situation in Iraq has \nworsened, U.S. taxpayers have been asked to shoulder an even bigger \nburden.\n  We are now spending more than $10 billion a month in Iraq for \noperations, and people have seen more than a 100-percent monthly \nincrease from when the war began. After passage of the supplemental, \nour commitment to Iraq will stand at far more than $300 billion, and it \nis moving higher faster and faster and faster.\n  Americans have come to accept what Bush said 3 years ago was wrong. \nIt was false. And they understand that President Bush's refusal to \nlevel with them over the last 3 years has made the mission of keeping \nAmerica safe even more difficult.\n  But 3 years later, Americans are still counting on him to accomplish \nthe mission. This is not a matter for future Presidents, as he has \nsaid. This is President Bush's war, and we need to hear him explain how \nthe mission is going to be completed. The mission has not been \n``accomplished.''\n  In the months ahead, President Bush must give the American people and \nour warfighters what he failed to give us on May 1, 2003--real answers \nand a real plan.\n  He needs to step up and explain his strategy for bringing the \nconflict to an end so our troops can begin to come home. As Congress \nand the American people have demanded, and Congress has passed into \nlaw, 2006 must be the year of significant transition in Iraq.\n  We need a new direction because our troops, their families, and the \nAmerican people cannot wait for the next President to be elected to do \nwhat is right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nAlaska is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Stevens and Mr. Inouye pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 2686 are printed in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). Under the unanimous consent \nagreement, the Senator from Massachusetts is recognized for up to 30 \nminutes.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3688, as Modified\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will use much less time, closer to 20 \nminutes.\n  I had earlier filed an amendment No. 3688. I ask unanimous consent my \namendment numbered 3688 be modified. I send it to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3688), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. FUNDING FOR PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE INJURY \n                   COMPENSATION.\n\n       For an additional amount to the ``Public Health and Social \n     Services Emergency Fund'' to compensate individuals harmed by \n     pandemic influenza vaccines, $289,000,000: Provided, That the \n     amounts provided for under this section shall be designated \n     as an emergency requirement pursuant to section 402 of H. \n     Con. Res. 95 (109th Congress).\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senate is currently debating an \nappropriations bill that provides $59 billion to continue the Bush \nadministration's failed policy in Iraq. This funding will\n\n[[Page S3777]]\n\nbring the total bill for the war in Iraq to $320 billion and still \ncounting.\n  Three years ago today, President Bush dressed up in a flight suit, \nflew out to the aircraft carrier, Abraham Lincoln, and declared \n``Mission Accomplished'' in Iraq. Our mission was far from accomplished \nthen, and it is far from accomplished now.\n  In my State of Massachusetts, 47 young men and women have been \nkilled, and more than 2,400 have been killed nationwide. For them, \ntheir families and loved ones, the mission is far from accomplished.\n  We all care about our service men and women fighting bravely in Iraq. \nWe obviously want to do all we can to see they have the proper \nequipment, vehicles, and everything else they need to protect their \nlives as they carry out their missions. This bill provides the $239 \nmillion for body armor and personal protection equipment for the \nMarines, $890 million for Army up-armored HMMWVs, $271 million for the \nMarine HMMWVs, and it also provides $10 billion for pay and allowance \nfor service members deployed overseas, and $1.4 billion for enhanced \ndeath benefits and traumatic injury protection.\n  The bill also includes the much needed hurricane and disaster \nassistance in the wake of last year's gulf coast hurricanes, assistance \nthat is critical to rebuild the devastated communities in Louisiana and \non the gulf coast.\n  It also includes funding for schools and levees, homes and small \nbusinesses, and other measures to rebuild communities and make them \nwhole once again.\n  In Iraq, as we all know, our military forces are performing \nbrilliantly under enormously difficult circumstances. The funds in this \nbill will help to provide the greater protection they obviously need. \nThey do not want, and the American people do not want, an open-ended \ncommitment in Iraq. What they want is a better and more effective \npolicy worthy of the sacrifice of our troops. They want their leaders \nto come together, to address the issues they care about. But what they \nsee is a White House focused on personnel changes, not policy changes. \nIf the President spent as much time on his policy as he has on \ndefending Don Rumsfeld, we could make greater progress in Iraq.\n  Unfortunately, the President's repeated failures to see each new \nthreat in Iraq before it is fully emerged has put our troops in \nconstantly greater peril. He disbanded the Iraqi Army with weapons \nintact and waited a year to begin training the Iraqi security forces. \nHe failed to see the insurgency metastasizing like a cancer throughout \nIraq before it was too late. He failed to see the danger of roadside \nbombs, IEDs, and sent our troops into battle month after month without \nproper protection. And now he fails to see the possibility that Iraq \nwill succumb to a full-scale civil war.\n  This is the point of the amendment I intend to offer to ensure that \nthe proper planning is underway now to protect our long-term interests \nin the event that Iraq continues the downward spiral into civil war. \nIraq's future and the lives of our troops are perilously close to the \nprecipice of a new disaster, the time bomb of civil war is ticking, and \nour most urgent priority is to diffuse it.\n  As of last week, we have been in combat in Iraq longer than we were \nin combat in Korea. At the end of this year we will have been involved \nmilitarily in Iraq as long as we were in combat in World War II. If we \ncannot achieve a military solution within that period of time, it is \ntime for our troops to begin to leave.\n  Iraq is obviously still in great turmoil, and all of us hope the new \ngovernment about to take office will be able to unite the country. In \nthe vacuum that has existed for so long, militias have taken control of \nkey parts of the country. We are now seeing the kinds of refugee flows \nthat signaled the beginning of the end in Vietnam. Shiites and Sunnis \nare forced by the continuing violence to flee from their homes and move \ninto separate communities in Iraq or become refugees.\n  With each passing day, the American people are becoming more and more \nimpatient with the administration's continuing incompetence in \nconducting the war. They do not want our troops to defend the same \nfailed course. They want a realistic plan for our troops to be \nredeployed out of Iraq. Starting this year, the sectarian violence \nbetween Shiite and Sunnis is fueled by the private militias and is now \nthe biggest threat to stability.\n  We spent a very considerable period of time, some 8 years, after the \nwhole peace process started in northern Ireland to have the IRA \nsurrender its arms, decommission their arms, put what they call the \n``arms beyond use.'' Finally, it became recognized in northern Ireland \nthat you could not be a political party and have a private army, that \nthe Sinn Fein could not have the IRA in the background.\n  And finally, to the great credit of the Sinn Fein, they gave up the \nmilitary part of the IRA. According to the international inspectors, \nGeneral de Chastelain, and others, they have put the weapons beyond \nuse. It has taken almost 8 years to achieve this. But in Iraq, we have \na constitution that entitles these political organizations to have \nmilitias. It is inevitable that we will have the kind of private \nmilitias presenting the biggest threat to stability in Iraq today.\n  General Casey, the commander of our multinational force in Iraq, has \nsaid that America will not succeed in Iraq ``until the Iraqi security \nforces--the police and the military--are the only ones in Iraq with \nguns.'' We need a clean and effective policy to disarm and disband the \nIraqi's militias in order to end the destabilizing impact of these \nprivate sectarian armies.\n  The new Prime Minister must act quickly to bring the factions \ntogether, and we in Congress need to help this effort any way we can. \nHopefully, he and his Cabinet can move rapidly to gain control of the \nwhole country. Their efforts must demonstrate to the Iraqi people that \nthe government will fulfill their basic needs and provide for their \nsecurity.\n  We need to begin reducing our military forces. Our presence in Iraq \ninflames the insurgency. The open-ended commitment of our troops has \nmade us a crutch for the Iraqis. It very well may be preventing \npolitical leaders from making the tough choices and compromises \nessential to move the political process forward.\n  The Bush administration has argued that we cannot cut and run from \nIraq. However, they seem more than willing to undermine Iraq's \ntransition to democracy. The U.S. nongovernmental organizations doing \ndemocracy promotion on the frontlines are about to have their funding \nslashed, just when the Iraqis need them the most.\n  Last year, Iraq passed several important milestones on the long road \nto democracy. The two elections and the referendum on the Constitution \nwere significant, but they were not decisive, and it is still far from \nclear that democracy is being firmly established in Iraq.\n  Obviously, the process of building democratic institutions will \nrequire patience in developing effective governmental structures, a \ngenuine rule of law, political parties committed to peaceful means, an \nactive civil society, and a free press. For a country as heavily \nrepressed for as long as Iraq, democracy will need even longer to take \nroot.\n  It is far from clear, however, that the Bush administration has a \nlong-term strategy--or even a short-term strategy--to solidify and \ncontinue the democratic gains that have been made so far. It makes no \nsense whatsoever to reduce the funds for democracy building. Yet that \nis exactly what the administration is planning.\n  I have offered an amendment with Senators Biden and Leahy to provide \n$96 million so that the U.S. nongovernmental organizations can continue \ntheir important work of promoting democracy in Iraq.\n  Organizations such as the National Democratic Institute; the \nInternational Republican Institute; the National Endowment for \nDemocracy; the IFES, formerly known as the International Foundation for \nElection Systems; the International Research and Exchanges Board; and \nAmerica's Development Foundation are well respected throughout the \nworld. Each has substantial operations in Iraq, and their work is \nessential to the administration's goal of building a stable democracy \nin Iraq.\n  Yet despite their success so far in helping to promote democracy and \nthe enormous risks to employees working in the war zone, the \nadministration has made no long-term commitment to provide funding for \ntheir work in Iraq.\n\n[[Page S3778]]\n\nEach organization operates on pins and needles, never knowing when its \nfunding for these operations will dry up.\n  We must be clear in our commitment to stand by these organizations \nand their indispensable work every day on the frontlines in the \nstruggle for democracy in Iraq. We also need to demonstrate to the \nIraqi people that we are committed to Iraq's long-term democratic \ndevelopment. We need a long-term plan and a long-term strategy that is \nbacked up by appropriate resources.\n  We need to refocus our policy in Iraq and provide the kind of support \nthat will make a positive difference on Iraq's long road to democracy. \nWe also need to prepare for the worst contingencies. It makes no sense \nto continue down the path of a failed policy and continue to put our \ntroops in harm's way.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3688, as Modified\n\n  Mr. President, I would also like to speak for a few minutes on \nanother issue--the pandemic flu crisis which needs urgent action. The \namendment that is pending will correct a serious defect in current law \non compensation for persons injured by vaccines. The lack of this \nprotection could well doom our effort to protect the Nation against \nsudden mass epidemics that could result from natural diseases or \nbioterrorist attacks. The Nation continues to face the danger of a \ndeadly flu pandemic. The clock is ticking, and we have failed so far to \ntake the actions needed to protect our people.\n  This chart shows very clearly the warnings that this Nation has had \ngoing back to June of 1992. Policymakers must realize and understand \nthe potential magnitude of an influenza pandemic.\n  Here it is May 2002: Authorities must understand the potential impact \nand threat of pandemic influenza. That is in 2002.\n  Then, we find the GAO, in 2000, stating: Federal and State influenza \nplans do not address the key issues surrounding the purchase and \ndistribution of vaccines and antivirals.\n  And we have, in December 2003, an outbreak in South Korea; and, in \n2004, an outbreak in Vietnam; and, in April 2006, avian flu in Britain.\n  This is the real danger. Even after these outbreaks, needed \npreparations still lag.\n  Other nations developed comprehensive plans for responding to flu, \nbut ours was inexplicably delayed. In November, the administration \nreleased a plan, but it was incomplete, and a new one has been promised \nonce again. While other nations implement their plans, we wait to see \nwhat ours is.\n  The story is the same on the stockpiling of needed medications. Other \nnations put in their orders for antiviral medications years ago, but \nagain we failed to act. As a result, America is at the back of the line \nin ordering these needed drugs.\n  As long ago as November 2000, GAO warned that:\n\n       Federal and state influenza plans do not address key issues \n     surrounding the purchase and distribution of vaccines and \n     antivirals.\n\n  Here it is June 2005, and the GAO reports:\n\n       The plan does not establish the actions the federal \n     government would take to purchase and distribute vaccine \n     during an influenza pandemic.\n\n  There it is, the time from 2000 to 2005, and the administration is \nlagging.\n  Congress has tried to move forward. In the bill the Senate considers \ntoday, Senator Harkin's amendment has added over $2 billion to improve \nthe Nation's readiness for a flu pandemic. Thanks to his leadership, \nthese funds will be used to strengthen our hospitals and public health \nagencies and increase the Nation's ability to manufacture vaccines.\n  In 2002, with strong bipartisan support, Congress enacted \ncomprehensive legislation to provide a framework for public health \npreparedness, but the administration still hasn't carried out the basic \nresponsibilities called for in that legislation.\n  The act required an interagency planning council to guide \npreparedness, but the council was never established. It called on the \nadministration to develop and implement a coordinated strategy for \npublic health preparedness, but this task remains undone. It called for \na registry of health professionals who would volunteer their services \nduring a public health emergency, but Hurricane Katrina showed that the \nsystem was ineffective.\n  In only one area did the administration and its allies work together \nto get something done. What was this urgent national priority? A \nspecial favor for the drug industry. Our Republican colleagues slipped \na sweetheart deal for the drug companies into the Defense \nappropriations bill late at night at the end of the session last \nDecember. The purpose of their tactic was to shield from public debate \na provision that would never stand public scrutiny. When I spoke on \nthis issue on the Senate floor last December, not one of my Republican \ncolleagues stood up to defend the provision or the process by which it \nwas included in the bill.\n  The provision allows drug companies to ignore basic safety rules in \nproducing a wide range of drugs and vaccines. Patients injured by \nshoddy products were given only an empty promise of compensation. It \nstacks the deck against patients and abrogates basic principles of \nfairness and judicial review.\n  Supporters of this provision claimed that it was needed because, \nwithout it, vaccine makers would not supply the national stockpile. But \nour committee has obtained the contracts signed between vaccine makers \nand the Department of Health and Human Services.\n  I have them right here, Mr. President. These contracts clearly show \nthat the drug makers received liability protections long before that \nscandalous provision was slipped into the appropriations bill. I will \nreference them. I will not include all of them. I will include the \nspecial provisions, the product liability and indemnification clause. \nMr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe indemnification clauses from the Department of Health and Human \nServices contract with Sanofi Pasteur, signed August 19, 2005, and the \nDHHS contract with Chiron Corporation, signed September 28, 2005.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Contracts for Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Provided Indemnification \n                 Liability Protection for Manufacturers\n\n\n From the Department of Health and Human Services contract with Sanofi \n                    Pasteur, signed August 19, 2005\n\n     H.9 Special Product Liability and Indemnification Clause\n       a. The H5N1 bulk vaccine product shall not be delivered for \n     use in humans absent either indemnification satisfactory to \n     both the Contractor and the U.S. Government or the enactment \n     or establishment of another sufficient liability protection \n     mechanism.\n       b. DHHS will assist the Contractor in resolving the \n     Contractor's liability concerns related to this contract.\n       c. In the event that an influenza A/H5N1 pandemic outbreak \n     occurs, DHHS will cooperate with the Contractor in explaining \n     to the public the Contractor's liability concerns and the \n     Government's efforts to resolve such concerns.\n       d. In the event that the U.S. Government desires to \n     distribute the H5N1 final container vaccine product produced \n     under this contract to any population, government or other \n     entity for use in humans, and prior to requiring the \n     Contractor to fill and finish vaccine, the Contractor shall \n     submit a request to DHHS for indemnification by the U.S. \n     Government. The Contractor's ``Request for Indemnification'' \n     shall provide all information and documentation as required \n     by Federal Acquisition Regulation 50.403-1(a), \n     (``Indemnification Requests''). The U.S. Government will not \n     allow any H5NI final container vaccine product delivered \n     under this contract to be delivered for use in humans unless \n     indemnification pursuant to Public Law 85-804 is approved by \n     the Secretary or his designee or unless another sufficient \n     liability protection mechanism is enacted or established.\n       e. In addition, the U.S. Government will work in good faith \n     to support the Contractor's efforts to resolve the issue of \n     tort liability associated with the performance of this \n     contract. The U.S. Government further agrees that the need \n     for liability protection in this contract is a legitimate \n     concern for the Contractor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n From the Department of Health and Human Services contract with Chiron \n                 Corporation, signed September 28, 2005\n\n     H.5 Indemnification Clause\n       a. Neither the H5N1 bulk vaccine product nor the H5N1 final \n     container vaccine product shall be delivered under clause \n     H.3a of this contract or otherwise, for use in humans absent \n     either indemnification satisfactory to both the Contractor \n     and the U.S. Government or the enactment or establishment of \n     another liability protection mechanism satisfactory to both \n     the Contractor and the U.S. Government.\n       b. In the event that Public Law 85-804 is the mutually \n     agreed upon means of indemnification or liability protection, \n     prior to\n\n[[Page S3779]]\n\n     being required to fill and finish vaccine the Contractor \n     shall submit a request to DHHS for indemnification by the \n     U.S. Government. The Contractor's ``Request for \n     Indemnification'' shall provide all information and \n     documentation as required by Federal Acquisition Regulation \n     50.403-1(a), (``Indemnification Requests''). In the event \n     that Public Law 85-804 is the mutually agreed upon means of \n     indemnification or liability protection, the U.S. Government \n     will not allow any H5N1 final container vaccine product \n     delivered under this contract to be delivered for use in \n     humans unless indemnification pursuant to Public Law 85-804 \n     is approved by the Secretary or his designee.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Perhaps the cruelest feature of this infamous provision \nis that it includes a sham compensation program with no funding. We \nhave seen the danger of this approach before because a similar \ncompensation program went unfunded decades ago. People in communities \ndownwind from the atomic test sites in Nevada received IOUs instead of \npayments to ease the cost of their radiation injuries. Senator Hatch \nled the fight to see that the ``downwinders'' received what they \ndeserved, and he was right to do so. We must not repeat the same \nmistake.\n  The lack of an effective compensation program also doomed efforts to \nvaccinate first responders against smallpox. Senator Frist recognized \nthis. This is what he said:\n\n       Too many health workers have been deterred from receiving \n     the smallpox vaccine--in part because of the uncertainties \n     about what would happen, how they would provide for \n     themselves if they suffered a serious adverse reaction to the \n     vaccine.\n\n  If we have a bioterrorism attack, and we have new breakthrough drugs \nand vaccines, we have to provide a compensation program for the first \nresponders. How do we expect them to go out and risk their lives--they \nmay become sick or something worse could happen to them--if they are \nnot even compensated for missing a day or two or a week or a month from \nwork? We have seen that you have to have a compensation program if you \nwant a vaccination program to be effective.\n  The right approach is a program that protects drug companies that \nmake pandemic flu vaccines or needed biodefense treatments and that \nprovides a real compensation to injured patients. That approach follows \nthe successful examples of the past, in the cases of swine flu, \nchildren's vaccines, when the Government set up a reasonable way to \ncompensate the injured.\n  In this appropriations bill, we have an opportunity to see that the \npromise of compensation for first responders injured by experimental \nflu vaccine is not an empty one. The amendment which I have and that is \npending provides $289 million for the compensation program. These funds \nwill give first responders the assurance they need that the Government \nis not making an empty promise on compensation.\n  Slipping a special favor to the drug industry in last year's spending \nbill without debate was wrong. But denying compensation to our health \ncare heroes would be even worse. The Senate should act to fulfill the \npromise to compensate those who keep us safe from pandemic flu if they \nare injured when they bravely volunteer to accept an experimental \nvaccine.\n  I hope the Senate will accept those amendments.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the next 20 \nminutes be equally divided between Senators Obama and Coburn, and that \nfollowing that time, Senator Bingaman be recognized for 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3696\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, in addition to the 20 minutes, I ask \nunanimous consent to call up amendment No. 3696.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COCHRAN: Mr. President, reserving the right to object, is it \ncorrect to say that in order to call up an amendment for consideration, \nat this time unanimous consent has to be obtained to set aside all of \nthe other pending amendments that are before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The manager is correct.\n  Is there objection to calling up the amendment?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Reserving the right to object, a moment ago a Senator \nasked unanimous consent to do that. That Senator is now the Presiding \nOfficer. Someone objected to his request. I am going to object to this \nrequest because of that earlier objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. OBAMA. What I will do, Mr. President, if it is all right, is I \nwill read my statement. I will divide time with Senator Coburn. And \nthen, procedurally, we can sort out my ability to present this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, it has been 8 months since Hurricane Katrina \ndevastated our southern shores. It was a storm that brought more pain \nto our citizens in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama than any other \nin our collective memories, pain largely experienced by the poorest and \nthe most disenfranchised but felt by all of us.\n  In the wake of this devastation, the Federal Government has mobilized \nsignificant resources, totaling over $100 billion, to repair levees, \nprovide temporary housing, and help cities and States rebuild highways, \nschools, and hospitals.\n  The task is enormous, but with proper planning, leadership, and \noversight there is no reason we cannot rebuild the gulf coast and help \nits people rebuild their lives. Yet if we don't work quickly to root \nout waste, fraud, and abuse in Federal reconstruction efforts, all of \nour best efforts to rebuild this region will fail. A dollar misspent by \na contractor is a dollar denied to victims of Katrina. Money stolen by \nfraud or abuse is money that is unavailable to strengthen homes, \nschools, and small businesses. It comes straight from the pockets of \nthe American taxpayer. Even worse, cronyism and incompetence siphon \nFederal dollars away from the gulf's citizens, and all Americans lose \nconfidence in their Government's ability to respond to urgent needs.\n  Unfortunately, the list of wasted and fraudulent expenditures related \nto Katrina recovery is startling, and the abuse continues to this day. \nLet me mention a few examples. We know that FEMA spent nearly $880 \nmillion in taxpayer money on 25,000 temporary housing trailers stored \naround the country, including 11,000 that are currently rusting away in \na field in Hope, AR. Why are they rusting away? Because FEMA went ahead \nand bought the trailers that their own regulation prohibited from being \nplaced in flood plains like New Orleans. They bought trailers for New \nOrleans that would not hold up in a flood. Great job.\n  We learned just 2 weeks ago that the Army Corps of Engineers missed \nan opportunity to negotiate a lower price on a $40 million contract for \nportable classrooms in Mississippi. Instead, a no-bid and overpriced \ncontract was awarded to an out-of-State firm. There are reports of \nprime contractors charging upwards of $30 per cubic yard for debris \nremoval, work that actually costs subcontractors as little as $6 per \ncubic yard. And as the Washington Post reported, four large companies \nwon an Army Corps of Engineers contract to cover damaged roofs with \nplastic tarp at a price of $1.50 to $1.75 per square foot for work that \nactually costs as little as 10 cents per square foot. A dollar seventy-\nfive per square foot is enough to buy roofing shingles. Why are \ntaxpayers paying a 1,500-percent markup for plastic tarp?\n  The list goes on and on: Funding for $438 a night hotel rooms in New \nYork City; FEMA hiring a company as an ice vendor that doesn't own \nicemaking equipment; millions of dollars for bus services going to a \ntransportation broker that doesn't own buses. We later found that this \nbroker earned almost $1,200 per bus per day while the bus companies \nthemselves received only a little more than half of that.\n  Together these specific incidents amount to an enormous problem, \nbillions of taxpayer dollars being spent and no assurances that the \nfunds are going where they are needed.\n  My good friend, Senator Coburn, held a hearing in the gulf coast 2 \nweeks ago to seek answers from officials in charge of contracting for \nKatrina. He found that neither FEMA nor the Army Corps of Engineers \nwere able to answer allegations of unreasonable costs and\n\n[[Page S3780]]\n\noverhead. They were unable to justify many questionable contracts. In \nfact, Senator Coburn found that Federal agencies routinely release \nincomplete data or no data at all about how they have been spending \ntheir money on hurricane relief.\n  Let me put this simply. There is no one accountable for coordinating \nthe oversight of these contracts. As Benny Rousselle, a Louisiana \nparish president told the Washington Post:\n\n       The federal government ought to be embarrassed about what \n     is happening. If local government tried to run things this \n     way, we'd be run out of town.\n\n  I am embarrassed. Senator Coburn is embarrassed. And every single \nlawmaker in this city should be embarrassed, too. What is worse, we \npredicted this would happen. That is why we introduced a bill last \nSeptember, 2 weeks after Katrina, that would have created an \nindependent chief financial officer for Hurricane Katrina recovery. \nThis CFO would have been in charge of every penny spent on Katrina \nbefore it went out the door and would have been able to prevent \ncontracting problems before they happened. But while our proposal \nreceived some attention, we couldn't find enough people in Congress \nand, more importantly, the administration who would support it. In \nfact, we were repeatedly assured by administration officials that a CFO \nwas not necessary, that the money would be well spent. Now after 8 \nmonths, $100 billion, and millions in no-bid contracts, overpriced \ntarp, unusable trailers, these assurances don't mean much.\n  We think it is time for a new approach. It is time for the Congress \nto put some of the checks into place that we first proposed last \nSeptember. Senator Coburn and I will bring to the floor a number of \nfinancial accountability and transparency amendments that will go a \nlong way toward eliminating Government waste and stomping out fraud and \nabuse. Our first amendment creates the chief financial officer position \nthat we first proposed last September. This office would oversee the \nrelief and recovery process and take responsibility for the use of \nFederal funds. We have witnessed the failure of oversight, \ncommunications, and control in the absence of a CFO, and our amendment \nfills a critical gap. We need to have somebody in charge of the Federal \ncheckbook. The buck has to stop somewhere.\n  Right now, 8 months after Katrina, we still have Federal agencies \npointing fingers at each other. This CFO will ensure that taxpayer \ndollars are being used efficiently and effectively, and he or she will \nprovide the financial information to Congress that is essential for \nadequate oversight and accountability. There is simply too much at \nstake to have no one in charge of these taxpayer dollars.\n  Our other amendments are commonsense approaches to improving \ntransparency and accountability and to reduce administrative waste. We \nrequire the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to issue \nmonthly reports on Federal Katrina contracts that are funded by this \nsupplemental appropriations bill. Every contractor who receives more \nthan $250,000 will have its identity posted on a Federal Web site, \nincluding the total amount of funds received and for what purposes. The \nWeb site will also show the contractor's location and tax status and \ndetails about the type of contract and whether it was competitively \nbid. This information is at the heart of transparency. We cannot reduce \nwaste, fraud, and abuse without knowing how, where, and why Federal \nmoney is flowing out the door.\n  We also address the dangerous problem of no-bid contracting for \nKatrina-related projects. There are, of course, situations in which \nexpedited contracting is necessary for emergencies, but Senator Coburn \nand I believe contracting officials should have to justify any use of \nnoncompetitive procedures and inform Congress of their actions.\n\n  The American people deserve the benefits of competition, when their \nmoney is being spent. Under this amendment, the Director of OMB must \nspecifically approve all no-bid contracts and provide details about the \ncontracts to congressional oversight committees within 7 days.\n  Finally, we would stop excessive overhead expenses from being paid on \nFederal Katrina contracts. We have an amendment to prohibit contracts \nwhere administrative overhead exceeds industry standards. People should \nnot be getting rich off of Federal contracts. They should be getting \nthe job done at a fair price. If exceptional circumstances require \nhigher overhead, Congress must know about it in advance. If the \nGovernment is going to spend $1.75 per square foot on a 10-cents-per-\nsquare-foot tarp, then Congress has the right to know why. And we \nbetter be able to do something to stop it, if necessary.\n  This is just common sense. The Federal Government must ensure that \ntaxpayer dollars are directed where they are supposed to go. If we \ncan't do that, we fail the American people, and we fail the people who \nsent us here. We also fail the victims of the hurricanes who need our \nhelp to restore their lives and their communities.\n  With the money in this bill, the Federal Government will have \nappropriated more than $100 billion in hurricane relief and recovery. I \nstrongly suspect that this figure will increase in the coming years, as \nit should. But before we spend another dollar in the gulf coast, let's \nmake sure that we have the right transparency and accountability \nsystems in place to ensure that every dollar is being used to help \nthose in need.\n  In our rush to get money to the gulf coast 8 months ago, we didn't do \nthat. The American taxpayers and, more importantly, the victims of \nKatrina have paid a heavy price. I urge my colleagues not to make the \nsame mistake again. I urge my colleagues to support Senator Coburn and \nme in this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Obama for his hard work. \nSoon after Katrina hit, one of the things that we noticed from our \nFederal Financial Oversight Committee was a lack of transparency and \naccountability in a lot of what the Corps of Engineers does, that FEMA \ndoes. We put forward a bill which did not make it out but certainly \nshould have, especially in hindsight, with the waste, fraud, and abuse. \nI am not going to go through the amendments. The distinguished Senator \nfrom Illinois has done that. The American public is entitled to some \nfacts.\n  We held a hearing 3 weeks ago today in New Orleans. The distinguished \nPresiding Officer was at that hearing. Here is what we know: Out of \n$1.6 billion for debris removal, we paid three times too much. We paid \nthe Corps on 30 million cubic yards $5 to administer it; $150 million \nto the Corps that was contracted through, and then they contracted with \na major national corporation which then subcontracted with a regional \ncorporation which then subcontracted.\n  Here is what we found. The easy work was cherry-picked. The hard work \nwas left to the people of Mississippi and Louisiana and some in \nAlabama. The local people actually have to do some of the work. One of \nthe ways to achieve recovery in a disaster is to make sure you \nencourage the employment of locals. What we actually saw was that when \nthe average price per cubic yard was $32--that is what the Federal \nGovernment paid--the average price received by those people actually \ndoing the front-end load of work and the dump trucking was $5 a cubic \nyard. So it was actually six times greater than what the sub sub sub \nsub--six levels of contractors down, the one that actually did the \nwork--got paid. Understandably, it is a big task. It is understandable \nthat we need somebody. But what we had was a bureaucracy that hired a \nbureaucracy which then hired five layers of contractors, and each one \ntook something out of the pie and didn't contribute much except the \nones actually doing the work.\n  In our subcommittee we have a poster that says: Accountability and \ntransparency. There is no transparency to this. We have to dig, fight, \nand almost bite to get the information out of the agencies. These are \nfour very commonsense amendments that will aid in transparency and \naccountability in the Federal Government.\n  The Presiding Officer asked during that hearing: Why couldn't the \nCorps have hired a contract manager or why couldn't the Corps have been \nthe contract manager and taken some of that\n\n[[Page S3781]]\n\nprofit that was consumed, which was about 60 percent, that didn't \nactually get to the folks in cleaning up the debris? Why couldn't the \nCorps have functioned that way? It was such a good hearing that FEMA \ndidn't even stick around to listen to the people from Louisiana talk \nabout their dealings with FEMA. That explains the real problems with \nFEMA. The contracting officer didn't stay for the hearing to hear the \ncriticisms, factually based criticisms, that were very enlightening.\n  The second area I will discuss is the Travel Trailer Program. The \nAmerican people ought to ask: When a trailer costs $16,000 to $17,000, \nand it costs $50,000 to install, something is wrong. But when you go to \nlook at the $50,000, we see this layering again. We see a layer to the \nCorps, to a major contractor, to a subcontractor, subcontractor, \nsubcontractor, subcontractor. The American people aren't getting value, \nNo. 1. And, No. 2, the people who deserve to be helped are getting a \ndelay as the process goes through.\n  I have a couple of pictures to show. This is what we ought to be \nasking of agencies. We ought to say you ought to be accountable. It \nought to be transparent. You ought to be able to find the contractors. \nAs a matter of fact, FEMA doesn't even go down more than one layer in \nterms of the contracts. That is policy; that is not law. They protect \nthat information so it cannot be available to Members of Congress or to \nthe American public to know what is going on. We ought to be able to \nsee results. We saw that we spent three times as much money to do \nsomething over a much longer period of time than what we should have.\n  We know, for example, the major contracts initially were no bid, of \nwhich the Corps took something off of the top as well. There has been \nno priority setting and no responsiveness, and there has been no \nspending discipline.\n  We ought to make sure the moneys that go forward are under the guise \nof good accounting practices, transparency, and we ought to be able to \nput in place, as this money is spent, a way for the Congress to hold \nthe agencies accountable on how they spend this money. It is my hope \nthat the leadership, chairman, and ranking member will look at these \namendments closely. I think they are very positive in terms of making \nthe needed adjustments.\n  On homeland security, we had a tremendous number of hearings--I think \n24--on FEMA. It relates all the way back up through the Corps and all \nthe way back down. Accountability is sorely lacking. These amendments \nwould correct that.\n  I thank my friend from Illinois for his insistence and hard work in \nthis area. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nMexico is recognized for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleagues for \nyielding the time.\n  Mr. President, the challenging situation that our country faces in \nterms of its energy policy, both its short-term and long-term policies, \nhas been vividly illustrated by the high prices of crude oil and \ngasoline that we are seeing this spring. The world price for crude oil \nis above $72 per barrel. We have seen crude oil price records being set \nin the last few weeks in terms of nominal dollars, even though these \nprices are still below the inflation-adjusted levels of all prices in \nthe late 1970s and early 1980s. We are also seeing gasoline prices \nabove $3 a gallon in many parts of the country.\n  In my home State, many are forced to drive long distances to work, \nwithout the prospect of carpooling or public transportation. This \nprecipitous rise in the price of gas at the pump places a nearly \nunbearable squeeze on family budgets for too many in my home State and \nacross the Nation. Consumers are confused and angry as to why these \nprices are occurring now. Their anger is stoked by reports of the high \nsalaries and retirement packages being handed out to executives in the \noil and gas industry.\n  There are many reasons energy prices have moved into this price zone \nthat is so unacceptable to most consumers. One factor is that strong \nglobal demand for energy has collided with a number of other factors \nthat have reduced supply. One factor is the reduced supply from Iraq. \nPrior to our invasion, Iraq was producing 2.6 million barrels of oil \nper day. Now it is producing less, more like 2 million barrels per day. \nThese export levels are far below the potential production from Iraq \nbecause its prewar oil output had been diminished by years of sanctions \nimposed as a means of constraining Saddam Hussein's power and \ninfluence. Today, Iraqi oil production is hostage to the internal civil \nstrife and instability in that country.\n  Another nation with significant exports of oil and gas is Nigeria. \nThere, too, domestic civil unrest, particularly in the oil-producing \nregions where the population believes they have not been given the \nbenefit of that production, has led to less production and greater \nuncertainty.\n  International tensions over Iran's nuclear ambitions have contributed \nto further instability and upward pressure on oil prices because Iran \nis a major oil exporter, and its territory forms part of the Straits of \nHormuz through which most of the oil from the Middle East passes in \norder to reach international markets.\n  Finally, closer to home we still have not fully restored the gas \nproduction of the Gulf of Mexico that was lost during last year's \nhurricanes. Oil production in the Gulf of Mexico is still some 335,000 \nbarrels per day short of the pre-Katrina levels. That is equivalent to \nover 22 percent of the former daily production in the Gulf of Mexico \nthat is still off line. The cumulative loss of oil production from the \nGulf of Mexico since last year's hurricanes is now over 150 million \nbarrels.\n  This constriction of supply has made it difficult to meet the growing \ndemand in the United States and around the world. Our own consumption \nof oil, particularly in the transportation sector, for the past two \ndecades has been rising with no end in sight. Developing countries, \ntoo, are increasingly following energy paths that require substantially \nincreased oil consumption. Their populations are becoming increasingly \nmobile in privately owned automobiles. In some cases, their electricity \ngeneration infrastructures have become more dependent on oil and \ndiesel-fired generation to compensate for uncertainties in the shipment \nof coal within their borders, and consequently the reliability of coal-\nfired electric generation.\n\n  Mr. President, I do not believe, though, that the high price of oil \nis entirely explained by supply and demand dynamics. Oil and natural \ngas are increasingly traded as commodities by and among investment \nfirms. This adds strong upward pressure on prices from speculative \nforces. At a time when other investment vehicles show less attractive \nreturns, the idea of riding the rise in oil prices as an investment \nportfolio management technique has gained a strong following among \ninvestment and hedge funds. We may not have the right balance between \nallowing such market forces to supply initial investment capital and \nallowing them to set off speculative frenzies that drive up prices for \nconsumers everywhere.\n  One proposal made in the context of this current supplemental \nappropriations bill, which we are hoping to finish action on this week \nin the Senate, is to reduce for a time the Federal tax on gasoline. \nThat is a proposal that has been made at several points in the past \nwhen prices rose significantly over a short period of time. A variant \nof that basic idea is the proposal to give a direct cash payment to \ntaxpayers.\n  In my view, neither is likely to provide immediate or significant \nrelief to consumers. Both are logistically difficult to carry out. The \namounts of money that a consumer would see are quite small in contrast \nto the runup in prices they have been experiencing. Neither proposal is \na real solution to the underlying energy problems. We need to get at \nthose real challenges in a more fundamental and realistic way.\n  So the obvious question is, What can we in Congress do in the \nremaining weeks of this session of Congress that would be bipartisan, \nthat could be signed into law by the President, and that would hold out \nthe prospect of eventually helping to moderate the price of gasoline at \nthe pump? I thought for some time that the most effective way of \napproaching the real issues that are driving the high prices\n\n[[Page S3782]]\n\nthat consumers find unacceptable today was through a four-part strategy \nthat is focused on, first, increasing consumer protection, and we all \ntalked about that, and I will discuss it in more detail in a minute; \nsecond, increasing supply, and there are steps we can take that over \nthe medium and long term will help with that; third, increasing \nefficiency in the use of oil and gas; fourth, providing incentives for \nforward-looking energy choices in the market.\n  A strategy along those lines is best undertaken in the Senate by \nbuilding bipartisan consensus through our normal legislative channels. \nThe current flurry of partisan amendments on this supplemental \nappropriations bill risks having us make some snap energy policy \ndecision, with implications we likely do not fully appreciate and will \nperhaps later regret. So let me describe the four-part strategy that I \nbelieve is a better path forward for us to consider.\n  The first area on which I will focus is consumer protection. We have \na variety of consumer protection measures in law today, but we have not \nyet convinced most consumers that we have all the tools necessary to \naddress their concern that some of the price rise they are seeing is \nthe result of price gouging. Every time we have an episode where prices \nsuddenly increase, our response seems to be to call for another study \nof whether any price gouging in general is occurring. It takes a very \nlong time to get such overall studies underway and completed.\n  A good example is the study on price gouging that was called for in \nthe Energy bill signed by the President last August. Here it is almost \n9 months later, and we still don't have any report back from the \nFederal Trade Commission in response to the directive that they do that \nstudy.\n  To the extent that price gouging is occurring, it is probably not \nsomething that is occurring on a massive industry-wide scale. Thus, it \nis questionable whether it would be picked up by such a study. It is \nprobably a more episodic phenomenon. So we don't really need more \ngeneral studies of this subject. What we need, in my view, is to make \nsure our system of laws is sufficiently robust that persons who engage \nin price gouging can be successfully prosecuted. States have their \nindividual laws, but we don't have a Federal law that can address price \ngouging strategies that are interstate in scope.\n  Our first step to protect consumers, then, should be to strengthen \nour national ability to detect and directly address specific instances \nof gouging that occur across State lines. There are several bills \nintroduced to fill this gap. One is a bill that Senator Bill Nelson and \nI have introduced, S. 1744. It is modeled on the price gouging statute \nof the State of Florida. It is not the only such bill, though. Senator \nCantwell introduced a bill addressing price gouging, S. 1735, as has \nSenator Salazar, S. 1854, and Senator Smith, S. 1743. What is important \nis that we address ourselves to the task of crafting a statute that \nfills the gap in potential enforcement that now exists.\n  That is something that the administration has not been willing to do. \nIn testimony before a joint hearing of both the Energy Committee and of \nthe Commerce Committee, the Chair of the Federal Trade Commission, \nDeborah Platt Majoras, belittled the need for price gouging \nprohibitions at the Federal level. She testified that no ``Federal \nstatute makes it illegal to charge prices that are considered to be too \nhigh, as long as companies set those prices independently.'' She went \non to say that ``the omission of a Federal price gouging law is not . . \n. inadvertent,'' but ``reflects a sound policy choice. . . .''\n  In her testimony, the Chairman of the FTC suggested that enactment of \na Federal price gouging law would not be ``appropriate'' and ``likely \nwill do consumers more harm than good.'' She said that oil companies' \n``independent decision to increase price is--and should be--outside the \npurview of the law.''\n  President Bush recently made a public statement that ``the Government \nhas a responsibility to make sure that we watch very carefully and \ninvestigate possible price gouging'' in the sale of gasoline, and that \nhis administration ``will do just that.'' It is unclear how his public \nstatements that his administration will take action against price \ngouging squares with the statements of the head of his Federal Trade \nCommission that it is neither illegal, nor should it be made illegal.\n  Mr. President, there are those who argue that price gouging is not a \nsignificant problem. They may be right. But consumers have a right to \nknow that there is a law prohibiting such activity and that it will be \nenforced to the extent possible by the Federal Government.\n  Another area that Congress should give some priority to in terms of \nprotecting consumers is in the area of preventing speculative frenzies \nfrom accelerating prices of crude oil and gasoline to the detriment of \nconsumers and to the detriment of the economy at large. Here we lack \nbasic information that might help us to quantify and address the \nproblem. There are important gaps in publicly available data on how \nmuch trading of oil and natural gas is going on, whether it is lending \nneeded capital liquidity to markets or, on the contrary, is distorting \nthose markets in ways that hurt consumers. We need to develop a way to \nget more transparency into those markets so that we can see if there is \nany manipulation or gaming of the system occurring.\n  Frankly, we do not know enough at this time to determine whether \nlegislation in this area is required. Last week, I asked the \nCongressional Research Service to prepare a report analyzing the extent \nof the problem which I hope can be used then to determine the questions \non which we need to focus in determining whether legislation should be \npassed.\n  The second area I mentioned on which we need to focus our efforts in \nCongress is to increase supply. This is an area which received a fair \namount of attention in last year's Energy bill.\n  Title III of the act last year contained numerous provisions aimed at \nboosting future supplies of oil and natural gas. Among these provisions \nwas new dedicated funding to speed the processing of oil and gas leases \nand permits on Federal land, and we are seeing that new direct spending \nbeginning to have an impact on the backload of applications to drill in \nless controversial areas onshore in the United States. There are still \ntoo many applications in the pipeline, but we are making progress on \nthe challenge of approving those in a timely and environmentally \nresponsible way.\n  The Energy Policy Act we passed last year also had provisions to help \nspeed the permitting of new refining capacity. To hear people today \ntalk about this issue of our national capacity to refine oil into \ngasoline, one would think that nothing has happened in this country in \nthe last 30 years.\n  The President and others are fond of saying that we have not built a \nnew refinery in the United States since 1974. That is technically true, \nbut it is also a highly misleading way to talk about this issue. We \nhave built a great deal of new refining capacity in this country over \nthe past decade. According to the Energy Information Administration in \nthe Department of Energy, in the 7 years from 1996 to 2003, we added \n1.4 million barrels per day of new refining capacity at existing \nrefinery sites. That is the same capacity-building equivalent as if we \nhad opened one new medium-size refinery in the United States each of \nthose years from 1996 to 2003. The Energy Information Administration \ncontinues to project growth in U.S. refining capacity, and their \nprojections are being validated by actual announcements of new refining \nexpansion projects. Just last week, Shell announced that it would be \nadding another 325,000 barrels per day of refining capacity at the \nrefinery it jointly owns in Port Arthur, TX. That capacity will be on \nline in 2010. So when we look at the actual facts on U.S. refining \ncapacity, we see a different picture than the extreme one the President \nand others have put forth.\n  That is not to say we cannot do an even better job of responsibly \nincreasing refining capacity. For example, the Government should look \nfor ways to bring stakeholders together to cooperate more in the siting \nof refineries outside the Gulf of Mexico coastal region, but we need to \nact in Congress on the basis of actual facts and not on the basis of \noverheated and inaccurate rhetoric.\n  If we want to make further progress in increasing domestic oil \nsupplies--\n\n[[Page S3783]]\n\nand we should want to do so--we need to look no further than some of \nthe promising areas in the Gulf of Mexico that were put off limits by \nthe administration when it first came into office back in 2001. The \nadministration took a large tract of potential production, called lease \nsale 181, and cut it down dramatically from the proportions that had \nbeen agreed to by then-President Clinton and then-Governor Lawton \nChiles of Florida. With the stroke of a pen, over a billion barrels of \noil resources and over 6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas were taken \noff the table. That was a mistake, and I and others decried that at the \ntime and have tried to reverse that decision.\n  This year, we have a bipartisan bill to restore much of that lost \nproductive capacity, thanks to the leadership of Senator Domenici and \nour Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Our committee recently \nreported a bipartisan bill sponsored by the chairman, cosponsored by \nme, to put most of the original lease sale 181 area back on the table \nfor consideration for accelerated action. The vote in the Energy \nCommittee was 16 in favor and only 5 against. The bill is on the Senate \ncalendar now, and it is the kind of constructive, bipartisan approach \nto our energy challenges we need to be embracing.\n  The third way we should act to moderate the prices we are seeing \ntoday in the oil and gas markets, beyond adding to consumer \nprotections, beyond increasing supplies, is we need to focus more \nstrongly on increasing energy efficiency and particularly increasing \nefficiency in our use of oil and natural gas.\n  Increasing energy efficiency represents the most promising untapped \npotential for further legislative action by this Congress. Some ways of \nincreasing energy efficiency can help to dampen the demand in the short \nterm and actually have an impact on prices.\n  In thinking about more efficient use of oil, we need to face up to \nthe fact that most of our oil is consumed in the transportation sector. \nGrowth in transportation demand for oil is the single largest factor in \nthe growth of our dependence on imported oil. So improving the \nefficiency of our use of oil and natural gas--these were the areas, \nfrankly, in which last year's Energy bill turned in its weakest \nperformance.\n  The Senate adopted a number of reasonable proposals to promote more \nefficient use of oil and natural gas when we passed our version of the \nbill, but the most significant of those provisions we passed in the \nSenate had to be dropped in conference because of the strong opposition \nfrom our colleagues in the House of Representatives. These Senate-\npassed provisions included mandating an economywide oil savings target, \nincreasing tire efficiency standards, and implementing a renewable \nportfolio standard for electricity.\n  Since the passage of last year's Energy bill, there has been \ncontinued interest in these proposals, and last year a bipartisan group \nof Senators, led my Senators Bayh, Brownback, Lieberman, and Coleman, \nintroduced a comprehensive bill, S. 2025, the Vehicles and Fuel Choices \nfor America Security Act. That bill provides a mix of energy policy and \nenergy tax incentive proposals aimed at moving our economy toward both \na more efficient use of oil and a more diverse future mix of \ntransportation fuels, including biofuels. I strongly support many of \nthose proposals. I am joining them as a cosponsor of that bill.\n  Because that bill contained both policy and tax provisions, it was \nreferred to the Finance Committee. Yet many of the provisions of this \nbill are in the jurisdiction of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, which ought to review and report those provisions to the \nfull Senate. For that reason, I am joining with a number of those \nsponsors of S. 2025 to introduce a new bipartisan bill this week that \nwill take those energy policy provisions and put them in a bill that \nwill be referred to the Energy Committee. In this way, we will have a \nstarting point for what I hope will be an effective and bipartisan \ncommittee process in the tradition of the bipartisan leadership on \nenergy that our committee enjoyed under Senator Domenici's leadership \nlast year in the passage of the Energy bill.\n\n  Among the most important provisions of S. 2025 and the new bill will \nbe an emphasis on an expanded plan for economywide oil savings. The \nPresident would be required to come forward with a plan to cut our oil \nuse from projected levels by 2.5 million barrels of oil per day by \n2016, 7 million barrels of oil per day by 2026, and 10 million barrels \nof oil per day by 2031.\n  The new bill includes a number of initiatives designed to reduce our \ntotal reliance on petroleum products in the transportation sector. I \nwill not elaborate on all of those at this point.\n  The fourth area of focus needed for our energy efforts is to create \nfiscal incentives that help forward-looking energy technologies to \nenter the market. As is often the case with technological advancements, \nmany of the energy technology alternatives that are poised to enter the \nmarketplace will not be able to successfully compete without \ntransitional help. In many cases, the problem is simply a matter of \ncost. Fuel efficient technologies are more expensive in the near term \nthan their less efficient counterparts, even though they provide us \nwith greater energy security in the long term.\n  So lack of market share will also make it difficult for emerging \ntechnologies to take hold and, thus, make them more attractive to \nconsumers. For instance, the manufacture and sale of dual-fuel E-85 in \ngasoline vehicles has been inhibited by the lack of appropriate \nrefueling stations, and, of course, the relatively small market \npenetration of these cars has inhibited the growth of appropriate \nfueling infrastructure.\n  One of the main reasons we have not seen better development of more \nfuel efficient and alternative energy technologies is that the \nGovernment, for the most part, has had too simplistic a view of the \nmarket and has not given adequate attention to the many barriers to \nmoving advances of research and development into the market itself. The \nEnergy Policy Act took some important first steps to remedy that, but \nmuch more can be done.\n  Again, there are a number of sensible proposals for additional tax \nincentives. Some of those are contained in S. 2025 to which I have \nreferred. Still others are in S. 2571, the Breaking Our Long-Term \nDependence Energy Act that Senators Conrad and Dorgan introduced. And \nlater this week, I will be introducing another bill that will take \nthese and other tax incentive proposals that have broad bipartisan \nsupport and put them in a form that can easily be acted upon by the \nSenate Finance Committee. I will not at this time elaborate on all the \nprovisions in that legislation, but suffice it to say that these are \nproposals which have bipartisan support in other legislation and which \nI think are very meritorious and deserve our consideration.\n  I have laid out proposals in four areas that I believe are both \nuseful and achievable in the remaining weeks of this Congress: first, \nincreasing consumer protection; second, increasing supplies of energy; \nthird, increasing efficiency in the use of oil and gas; and fourth, \nproviding incentives for forward-looking energy choices in the \nmarketplace. These proposals will best advance if we use a different \nmethod of legislating on energy than we have seen in the last week or \nso.\n  Frankly, trying to legislate on this supplemental appropriations bill \nseriously about energy is not the right way to proceed. We need to know \nwhat we are doing and what various measures will cost and what they \nwill achieve, and we lack the basic information for many of the \nproposals that are being put forth in the context of this supplemental \nappropriations bill.\n  The complexity and importance of energy policy is a good reason to \nask the relevant committees to give some of these proposals their \nurgent attention. Each of the bills I have described is designed to go \nto a single committee with jurisdiction over most, if not all, of its \ncontents. I believe this is the best strategy, if the committees then \nwill do their work on a bipartisan basis.\n  This strategy certainly has worked with respect to one of the bills I \nmentioned, the bill to open up lease sale 181. The Energy Committee was \nable to schedule timely hearings and a markup of that proposal, and it \nis now on the Senate Calendar. I compliment, again, Senator Domenici \nfor his efforts to get that bill to where we can act upon it.\n  Similarly, we have had good bipartisan engagement over the years in \nour Finance Committee on energy tax incentives, and I look forward to \nworking\n\n[[Page S3784]]\n\nwith Senators Grassley and Baucus on the ideas in the tax incentive \nbill I mentioned a few minutes ago.\n  Finally, I hope we can see bipartisan progress on marking up price-\ngouging legislation in the Commerce Committee. It has been several \nmonths since the joint hearing on price gouging, and there are \nlegislative proposals awaiting action before that committee.\n  In addition to leadership at the committee level, obviously we will \nneed the leadership of our entire Senate in order to move ahead in the \nremaining weeks of this Congress. In my view, it makes sense for the \nleadership of this Senate to structure our work on energy this year \naround a series of three to four bills that leave the Senate bound for \naction in the House of Representatives by a single committee. That is \nmuch better than trying to pass another Omnibus Energy bill.\n  Let me conclude by pointing out that time is short. As of today, we \nhave 16 weeks before the scheduled adjournment of this Congress. Given \nthat most of our work seems to be done on Tuesdays through Thursdays, \nthat will translate into as few as 48 more full working days, and that \nis not a great deal of time. By the same token, there appears to be \nenough time to consider controversial measures which we have been \nadvised are going to be brought to the Senate floor for debate and \nconsideration, such as flag burning, gay marriage, and a variety of \nother issues which, in my view, do not impact on the day-to-day lives \nof my constituents nearly to the same extent these energy issues do. I \nbelieve our time would be better spent on issues where both progress \nand bipartisanship are far more likely. With the appropriate attention \nby the relevant committees, a series of energy proposals could be \nbrought to the Senate floor.\n  I thank my colleagues who have proposed the various bills to which I \nhave referred. I hope that despite the short time remaining in this \nCongress, we can make some additional progress on finding real energy \nsolutions for our consumers. Our constituents are looking to us for \nleadership and action on these important issues.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). Will the Senator from New \nMexico please come forward to be the Presiding Officer? I would \nappreciate that.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am glad to, and I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant \nlegislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bingaman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first of all, let me compliment my \ncolleague from New Mexico on his presentation about energy. I know in \nrecent days I have read reports by various spokesmen and spokeswomen \nhere in Washington and in the press around the country saying that \nthere is a lot of hysteria in the Congress about the price of gasoline \nand the price of oil, and the Congress is making much ado about \nnothing, according to some. It is a very serious issue, and it suggests \nan even tougher set of circumstances to come with respect to this \ncountry's energy supply. Let me describe some of the reasons why, and \nlet me add to some of the things my colleague from New Mexico just \ndescribed that I believe our country must do in order to resolve these \nproblems.\n  We have about 20 million vehicles that are being driven in the \ncountry of China today, I am told. China has 1.3 billion people, with \nabout 20 million automobiles. In 15 years, it is estimated that they \nwill have 120 million automobiles. In other words, China is set to add \nabout 100 million cars and trucks to their roads. Will that \nsubstantially change demand for oil? Yes, it will. Will it have an \neffect on the price of oil and the accessibility of oil? It will, and \nit will have an effect on us in the United States. That is not because \nof our difficulty today, but it is reason to be concerned about \ntomorrow.\n  Every single day, we take about 84 million barrels of oil out of this \nEarth. Every day, about 84 million barrels are sucked out of this \nplanet and used. Twenty-one million barrels are used here in the United \nStates. One-fourth of all the oil that is taken out of this planet \nevery single day is used here in this country. This country has a lot \nof automobiles, a lot of vehicles. We are an advanced country, we are \nhighly developed, and we use a great deal of energy. Now we see the \nprice of oil spike to $75 a barrel, the price of gasoline at the pump \nto $2.80, $2.90, $3 and above per gallon, and people are concerned \nabout that, and should be. It ought not be a surprise to anyone that \npeople in the Congress are concerned about this issue.\n  The fact is, we have a circumstance where there is one sector that \nhas all of the gain, and all of the rest of the American people \nexperience all of the pain. I am not in any way opposed to the oil \nindustry. I have supported the oil industry on many occasions and will \nagain, I expect. We need oil. We need to use our fossil fuels, and we \nwill continue to need to do that, as far as I can see, for the long \nterm. So we need to produce more. As an energy policy, we need to \nproduce more. We also need to conserve more. That is very important. We \nneed to provide new and different kinds of energy in the form of \nrenewable energy. Most especially, in addition to conservation, we need \nwhat is called efficiency for all of the things we use every single \nday.\n  Let me talk a little about what has happened in this country. This \nchart shows the expression of concern that a lot of people have these \ndays. This shows the largest oil companies--there are only four up \nhere, but this shows the increase in profits--I guess there are \nactually five--the increase in profits year by year: a 17-percent \nincrease in profit, a 43-percent increase in profit. ExxonMobil went \nfrom $21 billion in net profits to $36 billion in net profits in 2 \nyears. Shell had a 47-percent increase in profit. We see another 37 \npercent increase in profit.\n\n  Now I am not opposed to profits. I am opposed to profiteering, but I \nam not opposed to profits. We have a capitalistic system, a market \nsystem. It works. Having taught some economics in college, I don't know \nof a better system of allocating goods and services than the so-called \nfree market system of capitalism that exists here in this country. It \nis by far the best method of allocation of goods and services. But that \nfree market sometimes doesn't work very well, and sometimes it needs a \nreferee.\n  I am reminded of the fact that it is the free market which has given \nus a circumstance where a baseball shortstop signs a contract that is \nthe equivalent of the payment to 1,000 high school teachers. So you \nweigh it, right? The free market system says a shortstop in the Major \nLeagues is worth 1,000 high school teachers. Do you think so? I don't. \nIt seems kind of strange to me. Then there is Judge Judy. I seldom \nwatch Judge Judy, but occasionally, when my television remote moves \npast the channels, I see her. She seems kind of intemperate to me. \nJudge Judy, according to People Magazine, makes I believe about 200 \ntimes the amount of income that Judge Roberts, the Chief Justice of the \nSupreme Court, makes. Free market system? Fair? Thoughtful? I don't \nknow. It doesn't seem right to me, but that is the system, I guess. So \nthe free market system is a system which I have always supported, but \nit does from time to time create strange results and needs a referee.\n  Having said that, we don't have a free market in oil in any event. \nWith respect to the oil market in this world, you have several things \nhappening.\n  One, you have OPEC ministers, and OPEC ministers from the OPEC \ncountries sit in a room and they make a decision: How much are we going \nto produce, and what price do we want for it? So they decide how much \nthey are going to produce. They are a cartel. I mean, that is the \nantithesis of the free market.\n  It is interesting that on this planet of ours, we have 6-plus billion \npeople, and we circle around the Sun on this planet of ours. For some \nstrange reason, we have been blessed by the Almighty in this wonderful \ncountry of ours with a standard of living that is nearly unparalleled, \nand yet that which we need to use, particularly in the case of oil, \nexists under the sands--in the largest quantities--under the\n\n[[Page S3785]]\n\nsands, for example, of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and Iraq.\n  The OPEC ministers from the OPEC countries sit around a room, and I \nassume it is a closed room, but I don't know because I have never been \nthere. I assume they sit around in a closed room and make judgments \nabout how much they are going to produce and how much they want for it.\n  Second, the oil companies are the ones who decide these days because \nthey have more raw muscle in the marketplace--and I might just point \nout that they all now have two names. They used to have one name, but \nthen they got romantically entangled and decided to marry up. Exxon \nused to be Exxon, but Exxon fell in love with Mobil and by and large it \nbecame ExxonMobil. Chevron-Texaco and ConocoPhillips, they all had a \nromance and they all merged, and this orgy of mergers--these \nmegamergers became these blockbuster, huge companies, and that now \ngives them more muscle in the marketplace, and that is just a fact. It \nis hard to contest.\n  So again we have the OPEC ministers sitting around the table, and \nthen we have the large oil companies, much larger because of the \nblockbuster mergers, and then third and finally we have the futures \nmarket. And the futures market regrettably has become, in my judgment, \njust a huge amount of speculation, giant speculation about oil. I \nunderstand how that speculation works, but sometimes speculation drives \nthese markets in ways that are completely unintended.\n  So we don't have a normal supply-demand relationship with respect to \nthe price of oil. As a result of that, today people drive to the gas \npump and it costs $50 or $60 to fill up with a tank of gas. A farmer is \ntrying to figure out how to order a load of fuel for their farm to put \nin the spring planting, and then they try to figure out: How on Earth \nam I going to pay for it? And even as they drive up to the gas pumps \nand the farmers try to figure out how they are going to pay for a load \nof fuel, they see the profits of the large oil companies, the highest \nprofits in the history of corporate America, the highest profits ever.\n  The minute you say that, people say: Are you against profit? No, I am \nnot. I am not at all. But I think it is pretty unfortunate that you \nhave one side with all the pain--that is, the consumers--and on the \nother side are the biggest oil companies with all the gain. It is \nalmost as if you have a hose hooked up to the pocketbooks of the \nAmerican people just sucking money out to go right to the treasuries of \nthe big oil companies.\n  So what do we do about that? I propose a windfall profits rebate. It \nis simply this: We say to these companies, the major integrated \ncompanies--only the major integrated companies--we say this to them: On \nprofits above $40 a barrel--and I picked $40 a barrel because that was \nthe price in 2004, the average price at which the industry had the \nhighest profits in their history--at profits above $40 a barrel, you \nwill have a 50-percent collection fee you have to send, which will be \nrebated back to the consumers. The Federal Government will get the \nmoney and rebate it to the American consumers. So it is a windfall \nprofits rebate. We collect it and then send it all back to the \nconsumers.\n  There is a way the oil companies wouldn't have to pay that. In the \nlegislation I have proposed, the way they would avoid paying that is if \nthey are investing all of that windfall profit back into the ground to \nexplore for more energy and thereby increase the supply of energy, or \nif they are building refineries above ground, then they wouldn't have \nto pay it.\n  They say: We need these profits because we are using them to invest \nback into exploration and drilling to find more oil, but they are not. \nThey are doing some of that, but they are using the majority of their \nprofits to buy back their stock or to drill for oil on Wall Street--and \nincidentally, there is no oil on Wall Street. But if they, in fact, \nwere doing what they claim they are now doing, they wouldn't be \naffected by the proposal I offer. A windfall profits rebate would say \nto the oil industry: If you are not using these profits to expand the \nsupply of energy and therefore reduce the price of energy, then you are \ngoing to have to pay this and it will be coming to the Federal \nGovernment and rebated to the American consumers from whence it came. \nIt is pretty simple.\n  We are literally, unfortunately, in this country held hostage to this \nprice of oil and therefore the price of fuel and the price of gasoline. \nWe can do something about it in an aggressive way in the longer term.\n  I helped, along with 2 of my colleagues, to write the renewable fuels \nprovision that was in the energy bill. We are going to go to 7.5 \nbillion gallons of ethanol fuel by 2012. That makes sense to me, using \nrenewable fuels and being able to have farmers plant in their fields \nthe corn that can be turned into ethanol. Then we could drive up to a \npump someday and say: Fill it up with corn. That makes sense to me. \nBiofuels, ethanol, biodiesel makes a great deal of sense. As I said, I \nwas one of three Senators who wrote the provisions that will take us \nnow to 7.5 billion gallons a year, more than double the ethanol we are \nnow using.\n  Wind energy. How remarkable it is to be able to take the energy from \nthe wind with the new, better turbines, more efficient turbines, take \nenergy from the wind and turn it into electricity. By the way, using \nelectrolysis, you can separate hydrogen from water and produce hydrogen \nand use hydrogen in a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle. By the way, with the \nhydrogen fuel cell vehicle, which I hope will be our future, you put \nwater vapor out the tailpipe and have twice the efficiency of power to \nthe wheels. What a remarkable thing.\n\n  Virtually everything in our life has changed. Technology is \nunbelievable. The Lunar Lander, in 1969, when our two astronauts, Neil \nArmstrong and Buzz Aldrin, landed on the Moon--a new automobile today, \nsold in the United States right now, has more computing power in it \nthan the Lunar Lander that landed them on the Moon.\n  My point is technology is changing everything. It is unbelievable \nwhat is happening with technology. But you know something, nothing has \nchanged with the car or automobile with respect to the way you fuel it. \nIt is full of computers, full of technology, it has more computing \ntechnology than the Lunar Lander that landed on the surface of the \nMoon, but nothing has changed since 100 years ago with respect to \nfueling a car.\n  I often tell my colleagues that my first car was a 1925 Model T Ford \nthat I bought for $25 dollars, and as a teenager, I spent 2 years \nrehabilitating this old Ford. I discovered later you can't do much with \nthe Model T, you just drive it until it starts boiling over and then \nturn and drive it against the wind for half a mile and then drive it a \nlittle more, so I sold it. But I loved rehabilitating that old Model T. \nWhat I discovered about a Model T is you put gasoline in a 1924 Model T \nFord exactly the same way you put gasoline in a 2006 Ford: You drive up \nto the pump, take the cap off the fuel tank, you put the hose in, and \nyou start pumping. Nothing has changed. Almost everything else in our \nlives has, but nothing has changed with respect to fueling a vehicle.\n  That is why I think, in the long run, we ought to go to a hydrogen \nfuel cell future. I hope our children and grandchildren are driving \nvehicles that do not need to use gasoline from oil. That's my fervent \nhope. That can happen if we make it happen.\n  We decided to go to the Moon, and we did it by the end of a decade. \nWe can drive vehicles by remote control on the surface of Mars. But we \ncan't figure out how to remove ourselves from our addiction to oil, \nparticularly most of which comes from troubled parts of the world? That \ndoesn't make any sense.\n  I think we have an intermediate strategy, including renewables, wind, \nbiodiesel; it includes dramatic conservation including more efficient \nautomobiles and a range of other things--more efficiency; more \nproduction. Yes, we need to produce more oil. I don't believe we should \nproduce in ANWR. I do support producing in Lease 181 of the Gulf of \nMexico. There are a range of areas I think we can and should produce, \nin areas in which we are not now producing.\n  But at this point I think we ought to understand, if we sit by and do \nnothing at a time when you have all of the gain from these dramatically \nincreased oil prices going to the largest integrated oil companies, \nonly part of which is being invested back into searching for more \nenergy, while all of the pain goes\n\n[[Page S3786]]\n\nto the rest of the American consumers, I think we should not be \nsurprised when consumers say to Congress: What on Earth are you doing? \nWhen are you going to get off your backside and do something about \nthis?\n  People have a right to expect that Congress will take action when \nthings go haywire, when something is wrong. Clearly, what is happening \nnow is not right. My hope is in the coming days we will see action on \nthe floor of the Senate that begins to address these issues. They are \nnot easy to address. I understand that. But to suggest that there is \nnothing wrong, to put our head in the sand and say this is just a \ntemporary aberration, don't worry about it--after all, we can easily \nafford a tank of gas on congressional salaries. What about people who \ncannot afford the tank of gas? That money is going, not incidentally, \njust to the major oil companies. We have 60 percent of our oil coming \nfrom off our shores. A portion of this money goes to the Saudi royal \nfamily, and they thank you. But it is not fair.\n  There is much to do. I notice in recent days a real pushback by those \nwho say: Don't be hysterical about this, let's not do anything, let's \nnot play the blame game--let's do nothing. Let's just let the coffers \nof the major integrated oil companies fill up, don't worry a bit, let \npeople exhibit the pain, don't worry a bit, this will all be fine in \nthe long term. John Kenneth Galbraith stated: In the long term we are \nall dead.\n  How about in the short term? What about the intermediate term, where \nwe can do something about the problems that exist, the real problems \nthat confront this country?\n  This country deserves better than it is getting. This country \ndeserves leadership. It deserves aggressive leadership to tackle \nproblems that are real problems in the lives of the American people. \nThis is one.\n  My hope is that that leadership is something that we can exhibit \nsooner rather than later.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez).

Mr. President, that concludes the list of amendments \nthat\n\n[[Page S3787]]\n\nhad been cleared on both sides of the aisle.\n  Knowing of no one seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, thank you. And I thank my colleagues who \nare working so hard on this emergency supplemental bill which has so \nmany important issues that address the needs of our troops: the need to \nget the equipment they need, the protection they need, and the needs of \nthe people in the area that was struck by Hurricane Katrina.\n  But I have to say this war, as we know today--and the President said \n3 years ago ``Mission Accomplished''--this is not exactly an emergency \nthat he didn't know about, and the war should be paid for in the budget \nand not in an emergency supplemental. The war is known. The costs of \nthe war were anticipated by some people whom this administration fired, \nand the costs of this war are spinning out of control.\n  In my own State, about 23 percent of the debt is from people who are \nfrom California or based in California, and we are suffering mightily \nwith these debts. The mental health problems of those veterans coming \nhome are not being addressed in the appropriate way. We read about \nsuicides which are off the chart, and divorces are off the chart.\n  I have to say I am very disappointed and concerned and angry that \nSecretary Rumsfeld still hasn't appointed people to a mental health \ntask force that this Senate voted on and said we ought to have, that \nthe House accepted, and that the President signed into law. On April \n7th, that mental health task force was supposed to be in place, and we \nstill do not have the people assigned to it, while our veterans are \ncoming back in very bad shape. I don't understand it. I call on \nSecretary Rumsfeld to do his job and follow the law and appoint the \npeople to this commission.\n  Frankly, we are not doing right by our veterans.\n  The Senator from Washington is here. I know how much she cares about \nthis issue. I know how hard she fought to expose the fact that the \nveterans health care budget was underfunded. And with her hard work and \nreaching across the aisle, we were able to add funding to the veterans \nhealth care system. But the needs of our soldiers are still not being \nmet. The horror they face is having a big impact on them when they \nreturn home.\n  I will be offering an amendment that addresses this mental health \ncommission, assuming that the Secretary of Defense has not acted. I \nwill also be talking about a very important facility that we need to \nset up in San Diego to deal with the west coast injured--from \nWashington, from Oregon, and from California. We do not have a place to \ntreat these who are being injured. A lot of these families on the west \ncoast have to travel to Texas, or have to travel to the east coast, and \nthe Navy wants to see this facility built. I will be speaking about \nthat.\n\n  Unfortunately, we could not come to an agreement on the immigration \nlegislation that I thought was well thought out. The McCain-Kennedy \nbill that took a look at the whole immigration issue said: Yes, we must \nstrengthen the border. We have to stop illegal immigration at the \nborder, but we also must deal with the hard-working people who have \nbeen here and bring them out of the shadows, not put them in front of \nthe line; put them in back of the line, put them on a path to legality. \nThat bill was not forthcoming from this body.\n  Then Senator Martinez and Senator Hagel offered another compromise \nwhich I thought was not as good as the original one because I think it \nwill be a bureaucratic nightmare to administer, but at least it is a \ncompromise between those who want to strengthen the border and those \nwho want to give people a path to legality. Yet we had a vote on that, \nand Republicans voted right down the line, no. They wanted to have \nendless numbers of amendments.\n  I have to say it is up to the Republican leader to bring this issue \nback before us and to resolve it. It is key to my State. It is key to \nthe country. I hope we can work together and once and for all resolve \nit.\n  Lastly, I want to talk about gas prices. Many Americans are paying \nwell over $3 per gallon for gasoline. Certainly, in my State, I have \nseen gasoline over $4 in my State. I have heard predictions that that \nis coming.\n  On a television show yesterday, our Department of Energy Secretary, \nMr. Bodman, had bad news for Americans. He said: Well, I guess we are \nin a crisis. I am not embarrassed about it. But you know there is a \nproblem. We have lost control of supply. I am not embarrassed. Gas \nprices are high.\n  I don't understand what kind of leadership we have here in this \ncountry with this administration. When you talk about Iraq, the \nPresident says: Gear up. We are going to have more deaths. He doesn't \ngive us an exit strategy, and he doesn't tell us when this long \nnightmare is coming to an end. Oh, just brace yourself, more \ncasualties.\n  Then you have the Secretary of Energy, and he doesn't say: Here is my \nplan. We are going to look at these oil companies. We want to \nunderstand why they are making record profits when they say they are \nsuffering with higher costs, that they were simply passing the costs on \nto us. Yes, prices are going up at the pump, but their profits would be \nlevel. Their profits are off the chart. One of their retiring CEOs had \na $400 million package when he left.\n  I do not know how the oil companies can say with a straight face that \nall they are doing is passing on costs when they give one individual \n$400 million.\n  Think about the average small business in America. They would never \ndream of seeing $400 million. This is for one individual.\n  I was pleased. I was on one of the Sunday shows with Senator Trent \nLott, and we were really looking at this out of the same lens. He was \njust as upset. And when we talked about windfall profits taxes, he said \nhe is willing to look at it.\n  I hope there is a way we can address the gas prices in this bill. I \nhave been working to try to make amendments germane to the subject, and \nif we can't get them on this bill, we are not going to go away.\n  We hear that Katrina, the Middle East, Iran, and Iraq are the reason \nfor these prices. And there is no question that instability in the \nworld and the aftermath of Katrina is hurting us. But, again, if these \nexternal factors are all it is, we would be willing to pay for that. \nBut, obviously, they are adding a hunk of money into their profits. \nThat is very clear. We are seeing profits off the chart.\n  In the first quarter of this year, Chevron had profits of $4 billion, \nup 49 percent compared to the same quarter last year. When we look at \nExxon profits of $8.4 billion, and a $400 million retirement package \nfor their former CEO, Lee Raymond, it is clear they could afford it. \nEnough is enough.\n  The President announced that he is halting deposits to the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve, which is the reserve that we have in case of an \nemergency. It is very full. We have been telling the President for more \nthan a year now to please stop taking gasoline off the market and \nputting it into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. You are shorting the \nsupply. He finally said he is going to stop filling it. However, he has \nnot said he will release any from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. This \nis the time to do it because that would have a downward pressure on gas \nprices.\n  We also need to take steps to reduce our demand for gasoline. \nObviously, when a family buys a car, it is a huge purchase. I know \nfamilies who are now considering buying a fuel-efficient automobile. My \nfamily did, even though it has been in the papers because some reporter \ndidn't do his homework that I own a gas-guzzler; I do not.\n  My family owns three cars and they are all hybrids. I have been \ndriving mine for almost 4 years. It is terrific. The men I know always \nask: Does it have pickup? It has pickup, yes. It does very well. The \nnewer version--I have the original version--the newer version now gets \nover 50 miles to the gallon.\n\n[[Page S3788]]\n\n  I ask myself: Why doesn't the Federal Government buy these \nautomobiles? My good staff who is here today checked it out and found \nout that every year the Federal Government purchases 58,000 passenger \nvehicles. According to the Department of Energy, the average fuel \neconomy of the new vehicles purchased for the fleet in 2005 was 21.4 \nmiles per gallon. So we can do better, that is for sure, with just the \nFederal fleet. It may not sound like a lot, but 58,000 cars that we say \nwe are now going to make more fuel efficient will have a salutary \nimpact on this marketplace. It is going to provide a bigger market for \nthe fuel-efficient cars. I hope, in addition to this, we can have a \nprogram where we incentivize States, counties, and local governments to \ndo the same.\n  I got the idea for this bill when I visited the San Francisco \nautoyard. We looked around and almost every car they have in there is \neither fuel efficient now or they are working to make it so. They have \ncars that run on alternative fuels. They are rehabbing their cars. All \nthe good ideas started in our neighborhoods. That was an idea I took.\n  I mentioned before, my hybrid cars are getting over 50 miles to the \ngallon. We know, unfortunately, that the American car companies are not \nyet up to where they should be with their fuel efficiency. This is sad. \nI have sat down with them over the decades--because I lived through the \n1970s when we had a fuel crisis--and they still refuse, saying \nAmericans want big cars, too bad.\n  The fact is, at least our American companies are now building fuel-\nefficient SUVs. This is good. So when the Federal Government has to buy \na hybrid car, they can buy a fuel-efficient hybrid car made in America \nthat is an SUV. I hope we can lead by example.\n  I don't take what Mr. Bodman says as a fact, that there is nothing we \ncan do, shrug our shoulders, and walk away. There is something we can \ndo. We can be smart consumers regarding the Federal Government with the \ntaxpayers' dollars. Taxpayer dollars should not be wasted on gasoline \nthat goes straight into the pockets of the oil companies that, in my \nopinion, are manipulating supply. I will get to that in a minute.\n  We now have a tax credit for buying a hybrid vehicle; the dollar \namount varies by vehicle. That is terrific. I propose we have an \nadditional $1,000 tax credit for purchasing a vehicle that obtains a \nminimum of 45 miles per gallon. There are now cars that get 45 miles \nper gallon and there may soon be other cars that get 45 miles per \ngallon, so purchasers of those cars would have the $1,000 tax credit. \nIf you have a hybrid that gets over 45 miles per gallon, if you bought \na new one, you would get a $1,000 tax break plus the tax break for \npurchasing a hybrid. That is very important because it is true the \nhybrids are a little more costly than a similar nonhybrid car.\n  The President of the United States came forward and said: I am \nordering an Federal Trade Commission investigation. I was very glad he \ndid that. Unfortunately, for the eight times I have called for those \ninvestigations, I have never had his support. I have called for no less \nthan eight investigations into gas price manipulation, but I was happy \nhe called for--finally, better late than never--an investigation into \nmanipulation among the oil companies and in each oil company. \nUnfortunately, 4 days later, he said: I have to say I haven't seen any \nevidence of any manipulation. That was Friday.\n  I am confused. He calls for an FTC investigation and then said: I \ndon't see any evidence of it, but they are working on it. It seems to \nme that sends a bad signal to the FTC. Why not ask your Justice \nDepartment, your Energy Department to work with the FTC and scour every \nrecord you can to see if there is zone pricing, to see if they are \ncutting back on supply?\n  I lived through the Enron debacle. We all did. But when I say I lived \nthrough it, those on the west coast got it in the neck from Enron. What \ndid the Enron traders do? They said: We are going to withhold supply. \nThey took power offline, and they said to the public: All we are doing \nis regular maintenance of our powerplants. That was not true. They were \nclosing down some of the power in order to manipulate supply.\n  Now we look at what is happening in the refinery business, and we see \nthey are not building any new refineries because they are monopolies. \nThey do not want to increase the supply. They like it the way it is.\n  How do I know this? It is pretty clear. California has changed its \nrules. We have a streamlined procedure now put into place by the \nGovernor and the legislature. Please come in, please build refineries, \nplease do them in an environmentally sound way. Nothing.\n  How do I know what is happening? This is it. Shell Oil announced that \nthey were closing down a refinery in Bakersfield about a year ago or \nmore. We were very upset, Senator Feinstein and I, the congressional \ndelegation, across party lines, the Governor, everyone asking: Why are \nyou closing down a refinery that produces 2 percent of California's \ngasoline?\n  The answer came back in a letter to me: Senator, we are not making \nany money in this refinery. We are losing money. Senator, no one wants \nto buy it. We have put it up there for sale, and we are closing it \ndown, period.\n  We did not believe it. We had learned the lesson of Enron, which is \nto reduce supply, so we dug around, and we went to the FTC, this Bush \nadministration FTC. Do you know what they did for us, despite all their \ntalk? Nothing. They did nothing. Zero.\n\n  So we went to the attorney general of the State of California, Bill \nLockyer. He said: Let me see what is going on. Guess what he found out. \nThe refinery that they said was making no money was making record \nprofits. Yes, there were many people who were interested in purchasing \nit. Guess what. It has been sold, and it is still operational.\n  So when I asked the oil company executives from Shell about this at \nthe Commerce Committee hearing, they did not tell the truth. They said: \nWe are so delighted we sold this. They never told the truth.\n  Maria Cantwell and I tried to get them sworn in to take the oath, to \nswear to tell the truth, but Senator Stevens said: Not on my watch; we \nare not swearing in these people. So they got away with lying to the \ncommittee.\n  When Senator Cantwell starts to call for ways to probe this \nsituation, the fact that we believe they are manipulating supply, we \nhave a reason to believe they are doing it. They did it in Enron. We \nbelieve they are doing it again.\n  I have a bill that requires the FTC to automatically investigate \nmanipulation in the market any time average gas prices increase in any \nState by 20 percent in a period of 3 months or less and remain there \nfor 7 days or more. This calling for constant investigations does not \nget anywhere. But if we have a law that says the FTC must look at this, \nand if they do, and they issue a report, they must hold a public \nhearing to discuss it, and if their findings indicate there is market \nmanipulation, the FTC works with the State's attorney general to \ndetermine the penalties. If there was no market manipulation, we should \nlook at releasing some of the oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, \nagain, to put downward pressure on the price of gasoline.\n  Finally, another piece of legislation, and I would love to have it in \nthe bill if I could, is to say that in the future if any oil company \ngives a salary, a bonus, a retirement package in excess of $50 million, \nthey have to make a like contribution to the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program because we know that many people depend on that \nLIHEAP program. Even though LIHEAP deals with home heating and cooling \ncosts, not with gas prices, that would be a fair thing to do.\n  I have spoken on a number of issues. I am pleased now to yield the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/01/senate-section/article/S3788-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3788-S3791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    MICHAEL RYAN BARRETT TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE \n                       SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Michael Ryan Barrett, of \nOhio, to be United States District Judge for the Southern District of \nOhio.\n\n[[Page S3789]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I assume the opponents of these nominations \nwould want to be recognized, or the Republican majority supporting him. \nI understand there are three Republicans to speak on the judges and one \nDemocrat is allowed to speak.\n  No one is here, so I will speak.\n  I will support this nominee, Michael Barrett. He has the support of \nhis home State Senators. I have also heard from both Democrats and \nRepublicans in Ohio. That makes it worth supporting. In fact, the \nnomination of such consensus nominees is an indication of what should \nbe done in States, and would lead to the confirmation of more judges. \nIn January 2001, we were following a shutdown of judges going through. \nAs the distinguished Presiding Officer knows, the Republicans were \ndetermined to block virtually all of President Clinton's judges for a \nlong period of time. I became chairman and for 17 months moved a record \nnumber of judges for President Bush, 100. Actually, since 2001, while \nthe Republican majority has not moved President Bush's judicial \nnominees anywhere near as fast as I did, we have still moved 238. That \nincludes two Supreme Court Justices, and 43 circuit court judges. \nHowever, we do have some that create problems.\n  Unfortunately, as demonstrated by the recent withdrawals of several \nnominees, all too often this White House seems more interested in \nrewarding cronies and picking political fights than in selecting \nlifetime appointments after thorough vetting. Sadly, the Republican \nSenate has proceeded to rubber stamp these important nominations and \nfailed in its role as a constitutional check on the President.\n  The controversial nominations of Judge Terrence Boyle and Brett \nKavanaugh are contemporary cases in point. With the extreme right-wing \nand special interest groups agitating for a fight over judicial \nnominations, the Republican leader of the Senate is answering their \ndemands by seeking to force Senate debate on these controversial \nnominees. Rather than focus on proposals to end the subsidies to big \noil and rein in gas prices, rather than devote our time to immigration \nreform legislation, rather than completing a budget, the Republican \nleader came to the floor last week to signal a fight over controversial \njudicial nominations is in the offing. Such a controversial maneuver \nserves only to divide and distract us from America's real problems. \nDuring this President's administration, gas prices have more than \ndoubled and undocumented immigrants have doubled, but judicial \nvacancies have been cut in half from the time when Republicans in the \nSenate were stalling President Clinton's judicial nominations. Despite \nthe real problems that confront Americans with respect to security, \nhealth insurance, rising health costs, rising energy costs, and \nspiraling deficits and debt, some would rather pick an election year \nfight over judicial nominations.\n  In fact, I mentioned Judge Boyle. I contrast his nomination to the \nnomination of Michael Barrett. Michael Barrett, as I said, will go \nthrough easily. I will support him. I will vote for him, as I told the \ndistinguished Senator, the former Lieutenant Governor of Ohio, now \nsenior Member of the U.S. Senate, Mr. DeWine.\n  But you take somebody like Judge Boyle. Here is somebody who has \nviolated every judicial ethic you can think of. He ruled on multiple \ncases involving corporations in which he held investments. In at least \none instance--this is chutzpah beyond all understanding--he was \npresiding over a case involving General Electric, and while doing that, \nhe bought stock in General Electric; then, 2 months later, he ruled in \nfavor of General Electric.\n  Now, in the first year of law school you might get an example like \nthis because it is so clear-cut and easy to understand. This is \namazing--amazing--not withstanding all the other conflicts of interest \nhe had in other cases. Whether or not it turns out that Judge Boyle \nbroke Federal law or canons of judicial ethics, these types of \nconflicts of interest have no place on the Federal bench.\n  This is not the first judicial nominee to engage in these kinds of \napparent ethical lapses. Less than two months ago, the President \nwithdrew the nomination of Judge James Payne to the Court of Appeals \nfor the 10th Circuit after information became public about that \nnominee's rulings in a number of cases in which he appears to have had \nconflicts of interest. Those conflicts were pointed out not by the \nadministration's screening process or by the ABA, but by journalists.\n  During the last few months, President Bush also withdrew the \nnominations of Judge Henry Saad to the Court of Appeals for the 6th \nCircuit and Judge Daniel P. Ryan to the Eastern District of Michigan. \nAnd we saw the arrest of another Bush administration official and \nformer judicial nominee to the Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, \nClaude Allen, who had earlier withdrawn as a nominee and more recently \nresigned his position as a top domestic policy adviser to the \nPresident. When we are considering lifetime appointments of judicial \nofficers who are entrusted with protecting the rights of Americans, it \nis important to be thorough. Unfortunately, all too often this White \nHouse seems more interested in rewarding cronies.\n  They add to the long list of nominations by this President that have \nbeen withdrawn. Among the more well known are Bernard Kerik to head the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court. \nIt was, as I recall, reporting in a national magazine that doomed the \nKerik nomination. It was opposition within the President's own party \nthat doomed the Miers nomination.\n  Over the weekend we heard that this administration's former FDA \ndirector is under investigation and its political director testified, \nagain before a federal grand jury. Of course, Mr. Libby remains under \nindictment, and Messrs. Safavian, Scanlon, Abramoff and a number of \nHouse Republicans are caught up in another criminal probe.\n  In light of this long list of failures of the White House to fulfill \nits commitments to the American people to be above reproach and its \nlackluster vetting process, it is more important than ever that the \nSenate and the Senate Judiciary Committee afford nominees the kind of \ncareful scrutiny that will yield enough information to decide on a \nnominee's fitness for an important appointment. In Judge Boyle's case, \nnot only were his answers to the committee's questions evasive, but he \nfailed to produce even the unpublished opinions he issued from the \nbench.\n  I am also concerned that the Senate Judiciary Committee is being \nrequired to consider the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit without a complete record. \nThe Democratic members of the committee have twice asked for another \nhearing in connection with his nomination. Mr. Kavanaugh failed to \nprovide meaningful and substantive responses to many of the questions \nposed to him at his first hearing and he delayed for seven months \nbefore providing evasive and incomplete answers to written questions.\n  In addition, a new hearing is warranted because several troubling \nissues have come to light since his initial nomination. As Associate \nWhite House Counsel and staff secretary, Mr. Kavanaugh has served in \nthe inner circle of the White House at a time when many controversial \npolicies and decisions were being considered. Senators have not had a \nchance to question him about his role in connection with those matters. \nFor example, what was Mr. Kavanaugh's role in connection with the \nwarrantless spying on Americans? What was his involvement in the \npolicies affecting detainee treatment and interrogation? What was his \ninvolvement in connection with military tribunals, torture, and \nrendition of prisoners to other countries? Given the scandals now \nplaguing the White House, it is important to know whether Mr. Kavanaugh \nhas had a role in connection with the actions of Jack Abramoff, Michael \nScanlon, David Safavian, the matters being investigated in connection \nwith the Plame matter, and many other matters.\n  The wall of secrecy that the administration has maintained is no \nenvironment in which carefully to consider an administration insider \nfor a lifetime appointment to an important Federal judicial position.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Ohio is in the Chamber. I urge \npeople,\n\n[[Page S3790]]\n\ndo not just do a rubberstamp just because it is a member of your party \nwho nominated these people. I think of the concern I heard from \nRepublicans in this body when I objected to a judicial nominee to the \nCourt of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, Claude Allen. Nobody said a \nword when he got arrested for fraud. But I bet you they breathed a sigh \nof relief that I blocked it before.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, in just a few minutes we will be voting on \nthe nomination of Michael Barrett to serve as a Federal district court \njudge for the Southern District of Ohio. Mr. Barrett is an outstanding \nattorney, a man who has shown his dedication to public and community \nservice throughout his life. I am confident he will be an excellent \naddition to the bench.\n  Michael Barrett's legal career--spanning almost 30 years--has been \ndistinguished, not only by his accomplishments as a litigator but also \nby his truly extraordinary record of public and civic leadership.\n  A brief summary of his background offers ample evidence of his \nqualifications. He is a graduate of the University of Cincinnati where \nhe earned both his bachelor of arts degree as well as his law degree. \nAfter graduating from law school, Mr. Barrett served the State of Ohio \nas an administrative hearing officer for over a year, handling issues \nas a new attorney that usually are reserved for lawyers with far more \nexperience. He then moved to the Hamilton County Prosecutor's Office, \nwhere he served first as an assistant prosecutor, and then as chief \nassistant prosecuting attorney of the Felony Trial Division.\n  During this time, Mr. Barrett also served as chief of the Special \nCounty Arson Task Force, supervising the investigation and prosecution \nof arson cases. After 6 years in the Hamilton County prosecutor's \noffice, Michael Barrett moved into private practice with the firm of \nGraydon, Head & Ritchey, where he remained for 10 years as an associate \nand then as a partner. He was listed several times in the Best Lawyers \nin America for his domestic relations practice. He then joined the \nCincinnati law firm of Barrett & Weber, where he continues to practice \ntoday in the area of general litigation.\n  Mr. Barrett has had an extremely wide-ranging career as a litigator. \nHe has argued in both State and Federal courts, and his court \nappearances are almost evenly split between civil and criminal cases. \nIn addition to his background as a prosecutor, he has developed a very \nsuccessful defense practice. He is a member of the National Association \nof Criminal Defense Lawyers, and I think it is particularly noteworthy \nthat he has argued capital murder cases as both a prosecutor and as a \ndefense attorney. Truly, his litigation experience spans the whole \nwidth of legal practice.\n  Mr. Barrett's expertise, however, extends well beyond litigation. For \nexample, he was appointed and served as a special master/trustee in a \nclass action lawsuit in which he analyzed over 900 claims, responses, \nand the allocation of settlement funds under that lawsuit.\n  He also was chosen to be the receiver in a securities case, and in \nthat role he worked with counsel to conduct the collection and \nliquidation of investor assets, which is an important and certainly \noften very complicated financial and legal task.\n  He also has an impressive amount of experience with the important and \nexpanding area of alternative dispute resolution. He was a board member \nof the Cincinnati Center for the Resolution of Disputes and was awarded \nthe Outstanding Service Award as a mediator for the Southern District \nof Ohio. This unusually diverse legal background gives Michael Barrett \na broad view of the legal system and a wide understanding that will \nhelp him be a very successful Federal district court judge.\n  Mr. Barrett is also an extremely accomplished community leader who \nhas given so much back to his community. He has served the public in a \nwide variety of roles--far more than I could certainly mention this \nafternoon. He served on the Supreme Court of Ohio Board of \nCommissioners on Grievances and Discipline for 15 years. He was on the \nboard of trustees of the University of Cincinnati, and the board of \ntrustees of the Health Alliance of Greater Cincinnati. He was also \ncochair of the Police and Justice Committee of Community Action Now, a \nproject formed by and for Cincinnati community leaders and charged with \nthe task of achieving greater equity, opportunity, and inclusion for \nall Cincinnati residents. He also has been involved with a wide range \nof charitable and social service organizations, including Children's \nServices of Hamilton County, Talbert House, and Boys and Girls Hope of \nCincinnati.\n  Michael Barrett is clearly a successful and accomplished attorney and \nan experienced community leader. Both are important qualifications for \nthis position. With his background and his experience, it is certainly \nnot surprising that a substantial majority of the ABA panel who \nreviewed his qualifications found him to be ``well qualified,'' which \nis the highest possible rating; the remaining members of the panel gave \nhim the next highest rating of ``qualified.'' This very high rating \nmerely confirms his excellent credentials for the position.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 \nadditional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Members of the legal profession in Ohio who know Mr. \nBarrett's abilities also support his nomination. I have spoken with \nattorneys and judges who have worked both with and against Mr. Barrett \nprofessionally, and they describe him as a calm and even-tempered man, \nwho is always willing to listen and always does an excellent job, no \nmatter what the legal assignment.\n  Even more important, however, is simply that Mike Barrett is a good \nperson. I have known him for many years, and he consistently has shown \nhimself to be warm, open-minded, and gracious. He is an intellectually \ngifted lawyer with a strong sense of the law and a firm understanding \nof the court's role in the legal process and in our community. As a \nperson and as an attorney, he has all the ability, the experience, and, \nyes, the compassion necessary to help him be an excellent judge for the \npeople of the South District of Ohio.\n  Michael Barrett is an outstanding nominee. I am proud to support his \nnomination, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words in \nsupport of the nomination of Michael R. Barrett.\n  As the distinguished Senator from Ohio has probably already commented \non--I just got in from Pennsylvania, so I did not get a chance to hear \nall of his speech--and as the Presiding Officer knows, because the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer is a member of the Judiciary Committee, \nMichael R. Barrett was passed unanimously by the committee.\n  He comes to this position with an excellent background. He received \nhis bachelor's degree from the University of Cincinnati. He received \nhis law degree from the University of Cincinnati in 1977. So he has had \n29 years of expedience in practice.\n  He was the assistant prosecuting attorney in the felony trial \ndivision in Hamilton County. It is always a good experience to be a \nprosecuting attorney, something that Senator DeWine did, Senator Leahy \ndid, something that I have done. He was an associate partner at \nGraydon, Head & Ritchey, a shareholder attorney at Barrett & Weber, and \nhas the qualifications to do an excellent job on the U.S. District \nCourt.\n  I am pleased to endorse him and urge my fellow Senators to confirm \nhim for this important lifetime position.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor and note we are just 2 or 3 \nminutes away from the vote.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S3791]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nvote to confirm Michael R. Barrett, whom the President has nominated to \nserve on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio.\n  Mr. Barrett has a distinguished and impressive record as a \nprosecutor, a defense attorney, and a community leader, and he has deep \nroots in southwest Ohio.\n  Mr. Barrett is a graduate of the University of Cincinnati, where he \nobtained his bachelor of arts in 1974, and his law degree in 1977. \nAfter graduating from law school, Mr. Barrett served as an \nadministrative hearing officer for the State of Ohio and then joined \nthe Hamilton County prosecutor's office as an assistant prosecuting \nattorney. When he joined the prosecutor's office, Mr. Barrett was \nassigned to the Felony Trial Division, where he participated in \ninvestigations, grand jury proceedings, and felony trials. In 1983, Mr. \nBarrett was promoted to be a chief assistant of the Felony Trial \nDivision.\n  In 1984, Mr. Barrett joined Graydon, Head & Ritchey, where he worked \non both criminal and civil matters, initially as an associate before \nbeing promoted to partner. In 1995, he joined his current firm, Barrett \n& Weber, where he has continued to practice in the same areas of law.\n  Mr. Barrett's law practice includes criminal defense work covering \nthe spectrum of the Criminal Code. In addition, Mr. Barrett maintains \nan active civil litigation practice including recent securities law \nmatters in which he has represented individual plaintiffs as well as \nthe attorney general's office for the State of Ohio. His practice has \nearned him several listings in ``Best Lawyers in America'' and ``Ohio \nSuper Lawyers.'' In addition, Mr. Barrett has received the Outstanding \nService Award as a Mediator from the U.S. District Court for the \nSouthern District of Ohio. In sum, Mr. Barrett has the broad courtroom \nexperience that will serve him well as a federal judge.\n  Mr. Barrett has also served on the Supreme Court of Ohio's Board of \nCommissioners on Grievances and Discipline, which evidences the high \nesteem in which members of the Ohio bar hold him and is testimony of \nhis excellent character.\n  As a result of Mr. Barrett's fine academic and professional \nachievements, I am not surprised that the American Bar Association \nfound Mr. Barrett qualified to serve as a Federal district court judge.\n  Mr. Barrett's legal credentials are not the only reasons I support \nhis nomination. In an age where I believe too many people do not take \nthe time to become active members of their communities, Mr. Barrett has \nbeen a community leader. Some of Mr. Barrett's community activities \ninclude his current service on the board of trustees of Talbert House, \na Cincinnati-area social service organization; his current service as a \ndirector of Boys Hope/Girls Hope of Cincinnati, an organization \ndesigned to provide an array of services for at-risk children; and his \npast service as a trustee of Children's Services of Hamilton County. \nWhen I was Governor of Ohio, I was pleased to appoint Mr. Barrett to \nthe board of trustees of the University of Cincinnati. He served 9 \nyears on the board of trustees, including a period as chairman.\n  Involvement in one's community is important. We need judges who not \nonly have exceptional legal skills but who also recognize how the law \nimpacts individuals and communities. I believe Mr. Barrett has this \nunderstanding because he is out in his community every day.\n  In reviewing Mr. Barrett's academic and professional record, it is \nclear that he is well qualified to serve as a Federal district court \njudge on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, and \nI urge my colleagues to support his nomination.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Michael Ryan Barrett, of Ohio, to be United States District Judge \nfor the Southern District of Ohio? On this question, the yeas and nays \nhave been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the \nSenator from North Carolina (Mr. Burr), the Senator from South Carolina \n(Mr. Graham), the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Santorum), and the \nSenator from Alabama (Mr. Sessions).\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), \nthe Senator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin), the Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. \nKohl), and the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) and \nthe Senator from Arkansas (Mrs. Lincoln) are absent due to death in \nfamily.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from Iowa \n(Mr. Harkin), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) and the \nSenator from Arkansas (Mrs. Lincoln) would each vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune).

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an \nindividual who is a native of my State and probably is not well known \nto Members of this body. He was involved in an industry for which all \nof us have a great appreciation. The name of the gentleman is Phil \nWalden.\n  About 40-plus years ago, when I was at the University of Georgia, I \nhad a college roommate who was responsible for booking bands for a \nnumber of fraternities, sororities, and whatnot at the University of \nGeorgia. He came into contact with a man named Phil Walden. I got to \nknow Phil through my roommate Mike Brody.\n  Phil Walden was an unusual individual. After graduating from Mercy \nUniversity in 1962 in Macon, GA, he became a full-time professional \npromoter of bands. During his college days, he teamed up with an \nindividual from Macon, GA, who became a superstar. That superstar's \nname was Otis Redding.\n  Phil Walden found Otis Redding at a nightclub in Macon, GA, and made \nhim a rich and famous person in the music industry. Otis Redding was \nthe heart and soul of soul music for a number of years. Unfortunately, \nOtis Redding\n\n[[Page S3792]]\n\ndied in a plane crash in 1967, and a lot of Phil Walden's hopes and \ndreams died with him.\n  But Phil Walden didn't stop with just rhythm and blues bands. About \nthe time that Otis Redding's plane went down, Phil Walden founded \nCapricorn Records and found another band in Macon, GA, called the \nAllman Brothers. He then promoted the Allman Brothers into superstar \nstatus, and the Allman Brothers became the heart and soul of southern \nrock and roll music.\n  Phil Walden hit hard times when heavy rock and roll hit hard times. \nUnfortunately, Duane Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident in \n1971. Another star member of the band, Barry Oakley, was killed shortly \nthereafter. The Allman Brothers hit on hard times, and so did Phil \nWalden. He had problems with abuse and use of alcohol and drugs, like \nso many folks in the music industry.\n  Phil Walden hit a low point in his life, but Phil Walden rebounded \nfrom that, just like the music industry he knew and loved so well. He \nmoved to Nashville and stayed for a time in Nashville.\n  While he was in Nashville, he discovered another band in Athens, GA, \ncalled Widespread Panic. They are a little beyond my generation, but my \nson has been to a number of Widespread Panic concerts around the \nSoutheast, and I venture to say that the children of a lot of our \nMembers likewise, if you mention Widespread Panic to them, their eyes \nlight up.\n  Phil Walden was the kind of man who had the ability to bounce back, \nand he did so. He was an icon in his industry. He represented, I \nnoticed in looking at the various obituaries, a number of folks, \nfrankly, I did not know he represented in all the years I knew Phil. \nHere are several of the bands and acts Phil Walden either managed at \nCapricorn Records or promoted otherwise: I mentioned Otis Redding and \nthe Allman Brothers, Percy Sledge, Boz Skaggs, the Charlie Daniels \nBand, the Marshall Tucker Band, Wet Willie, Kenny Chesney, 311, Cake, \nLynyrd Skynyrd, Hank Williams, Jr., Billy Joe Shaver, and Stillwater.\n  Phil Walden hit on hard medical times also in recent years. Last \nSunday, Phil lost his battle with cancer and, unfortunately, passed \naway. He had a burial last Thursday in Macon, GA, at Rose Hill \nCemetery, where he was laid to rest in the same cemetery as Duane \nAllman and Barry Oakley.\n  Phil Walden was truly an unusual person in the music industry. In the \n1960s, he took a Black man in Otis Redding, brought him to a White \nuniversity, White universities all across the Southeast, without any \nmajor incidents whatsoever, and that was significantly unusual. As \nPeter Conlin, a promoter and longtime friend of Phil Walden, said:\n\n       If you look at a white guy from the south in the '60s \n     trying to promote a black singer, that was a brave thing to \n     do.\n\n  And it truly was. Phil Walden did it with class, he did it with \nstyle, and he did it with success. Phil Walden then took the Allman \nBrothers and did it with style, did it with class, did it with success. \nHe was a true dream story, a true story of the American dream in the \nmusic industry. He is someone the music industry is going to miss.\n  Phil certainly lived an interesting life, and his wife Peggy, who \nstood by his side for so many years, deserves a lot of credit for the \nsuccess Phil had, both in the music industry as well as in bringing his \nlife back together. We are all going to miss Phil Walden.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as we reflect on the Presidency of George \nW. Bush, there were moments of high drama. Certainly, the moment of \nhighest drama in my recollection was when the President visited the \nsite of the 9/11 attack. When he went to New York and walked through \nthe smoke-filled rubble with the firefighters and the workmen still \ndigging through, it was a moment that I am sure will endure. It will be \nremembered.\n  If you had to then select another moment in his Presidency that will \nbe remembered, it was a moment 3 years ago today when the President of \nthe United States boarded a Naval fighter plane and flew to land on the \ndeck of USS Abraham Lincoln.\n  It was a time when America wasn't certain about what had happened in \nIraq. We had launched an invasion. Saddam Hussein had been deposed. \nThere were still a lot of questions about the future of Iraq and what \nwould happen in that country.\n  The President of the United States came to that aircraft carrier on \nthat day, and as he landed and spoke to those who were assembled, \nbehind him was a banner which read ``Mission Accomplished.'' It was on \nMay 1, 2003, 3 years ago. The President said on that day:\n\n       In the battle of Iraq, the United States and our allies \n     have prevailed. And now our coalition is engaged in securing \n     and restructuring that country.\n\n  The President went on to say:\n\n       We have difficult work to do in Iraq. We're bringing order \n     to parts of that country that remain dangerous. We're \n     pursuing and finding leaders of the old regime, who will be \n     held to account for their crimes. We've begun the search for \n     hidden chemical and biological weapons and already know of \n     hundreds of sites that will be investigated. We're helping to \n     build Iraq, where the dictator built palaces for himself \n     instead of hospitals and schools. And we will stand with the \n     new leaders of Iraq as they establish a government of, by, \n     and for the Iraqi people.\n\n\n[[Page S3794]]\n\n\n  The President went on to say 3 years ago:\n\n       From Pakistan to the Philippines to the Horn of Africa, we \n     are hunting down al-Qaida killers. Nineteen months ago, I \n     pledged that the terrorists would not escape the patient \n     justice of the United States. And as of tonight, nearly one-\n     half of al-Qaida's senior operatives have been captured or \n     killed.\n\n  That was the speech of the President of the United States 3 years ago \ntoday.\n  Since the President made that speech, this is the grim record. Since \nthat day, over the last 3 years, 2,262 Americans have been killed and \n17,202 Americans have been wounded.\n  This occurred after the President announced to the world that our \nmission was accomplished.\n  As we gather today to mark the third anniversary of that Presidential \nstatement, war continues with no end in sight, and 2,401 of our best \nand bravest soldiers have given their lives. I have called many of \nthose families from Illinois. I have attended some of the funerals. I \nknow the lives of those families will never be the same. They have \ngiven so much to this country. We thank them. We will continue to thank \nthem over and over again. We thank the men and women in uniform for \ncontinuing to stand and fight to defend this country and its values. \nThey represent the very best. We should never forget that.\n  But we now know that within their ranks--even at the highest levels--\nthere have been serious concerns about this administration and its \nstrategy in Iraq.\n  Three years after President Bush's statement on that carrier that our \nmission was accomplished, several leading generals, men who served \nunder the President at that time, men under his command, men who were \nresponsible for the lives of thousands of soldiers and marines, now \nretired, in civilian status, have stepped forward. What have they said?\n  Retired LTG Gregory Newbold, the three-star Marine Corps general who \nserved as the Nation's top operations officer before the invasion of \nIraq, recently joined a number of his former colleagues and said:\n\n       I am driven to action now by the missteps and misjudgments \n     of the White House and the Pentagon, and by my many painful \n     visits to our military hospitals. In those places, I have \n     been both inspired and shaken by the broken bodies but \n     unbroken spirits of soldiers, Marines and corpsmen returning \n     from this war. The cost of flawed leadership continues to be \n     paid in blood. The willingness of our forces to shoulder such \n     a load should make it a sacred obligation for civilian and \n     military leaders to get our defense policy right. They must \n     be absolutely sure that the commitment is for a cause as \n     honorable as the sacrifice.\n\n  General Newbold continued:\n\n       My sincere view is that the commitment of our forces to \n     this fight was done with the casualness and a swagger that \n     are the special province of those who have never had to \n     execute these missions--or bury the results.\n\n  Finally, the general said:\n\n       We need fresh ideas and fresh faces. That means, as a first \n     step, replacing Rumsfeld and many others unwilling to \n     fundamentally change their approach. The troops in the Middle \n     East have performed their duty. Now we need people in \n     Washington who can construct a unified strategy worthy of \n     them. It is time to send a signal to our Nation, our forces \n     and the world that we are uncompromising on our security but \n     are prepared to rethink how we achieve it.\n\n  General Newbold is joined in this call for change by GEN Anthony \nZinni; MG Paul D. Eaton; MG John Batiste; MG Charles Swannack, Jr.; and \nMG John Riggs, all retired.\n  If you look at the resumes of these men, you will find the very best \nin service to our country. General Eaton, who headed up training for \nthe Iraqi military from 2003 to 2004--what did he say? I quote him:\n\n       Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld is not competent to lead \n     America's Armed Forces.\n\n  General Swannack, former commander of the 82nd Airborne Division, one \nof the most storied and honored divisions in American military \nhistory--here is what he said:\n\n       I do not believe Secretary Rumsfeld is the right person to \n     fight that war based on his absolute failures in managing the \n     war against Saddam in Iraq.\n\n  These generals are calling for change at the highest level. How many \ntimes during the course of this war when the President was questioned \nabout his military strategy did he say: I defer to the generals; I \ndefer to the military professionals. This will not be a political \ndecision.\n\n  That is the right response. But what would he now say when these six \nmen, many of whom served under his command, have stepped forward and \nsaid that the plan for this war is so wrong and that the man executing \nthat plan as Secretary of Defense is not the right person for that job?\n  I have said publicly, and I will repeat it. I believe Secretary \nRumsfeld, for the good of this Nation, should leave as Secretary of \nDefense. I believe this for the same reason these generals do. I do not \nbelieve he can lead us to the right conclusion in Iraq, and we will pay \na heavy price if we do not acknowledge that.\n  As General Zinni has said, staying the course in Iraq sends us right \nover Niagara Falls. We have to change the course. We have to understand \nwhy change is imperative. It is worth taking a few minutes to \nunderstand how we have reached this point some 3 years after President \nBush told the world our mission was accomplished.\n  Recently, Secretary of State Rice stated the United States has made \nthousands of ``tactical errors.'' Secretary Rumsfeld challenged her, \nand said: ``I don't know what she is talking about.''\n  She was right. The administration has made numerous and tragically \ncostly mistakes in Iraq. Think about it. The decision to invade without \nallies--with only the United Kingdom as a major force by our side, and \nmany other countries sending smaller forces, we went in virtually \nalone. It was a strategic misjudgement that has left us today carrying \nthe military and financial burdens in Iraq.\n  Before us on the floor of the Senate is another spending bill for \nIraq--this one over $100 billion. The total no one can guess, but $320 \nbillion so far, more than $2 billion a week.\n  My situation is like some in the Senate. I voted against the use-of-\nforce resolution for the war in Iraq--23 of us did, 1 Republican and 22 \nDemocrats on that October night in 2002. But I said from my memory of \nwhat happened in Vietnam, as I tried my best to appreciate what our \nsoldiers faced, that I would vote for every penny that this President \nasked for to wage this war so that the soldiers would always have what \nthey needed to win and come home safely. And I have done that. I will \ncontinue to do that.\n  When my critics ask: How can you be against the war and vote to fund \nit? The question comes down to something very basic from where I am \nstanding. If it were my son or daughter serving in uniform in that \ncountry, I would want them to have everything to come home safely, even \nif I bitterly disagreed with the administration's policy that sent them \ninto this war.\n  We have 132,000 soldiers in Iraq today. Our combined allies have \n24,000, some of whom are in Kuwait. Mr. President, 2,401 Americans have \ndied. That is more than 10 times the losses that have been suffered by \nthe rest of the so-called Coalition of the Willing.\n  This record-setting supplemental bill that we take up this week in \nthe Senate will bring the cost of U.S. operations in Iraq to $280 \nbillion. For now, as I have said: I am going to vote for it. But before \nthis Congress continues to fund, we have to ask hard questions.\n  If this is going to be a routine vote for the so-called emergency \nsupplemental bill, if this is going to be routine to the point where we \ndon't even question the policies and strategies of the war that we are \nvoting for, then we have failed in our responsibilities as Senators.\n  On February 25, 2003, the Army Chief of Staff, GEN Eric Shinseki, \ntestified before the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  General Shinseki stated, in an invasion of Iraq, that ``any postwar \noccupying force would have to be big enough to maintain safety in a \ncountry with ethnic tensions that could lead to other problems.''\n  General Shinseki was asked how many troops are needed, and he said:\n\n       Something on the order of several hundred thousand \n     soldiers.\n\n  He also said:\n\n       Assistance from friend and allies would be helpful.\n\n  General Shinseki did not get the 300,000 or 400,000 troops that he \nand many others thought would be needed nor did we get the allies. \nGeneral Shinseki, for his candor and honesty, was replaced in his \ncommand. This administration was not about to stand\n\n[[Page S3795]]\n\nstill for someone in uniform telling them the stark, honest truth, that \nwithout enough soldiers the ones we sent would be in danger.\n  And just as Economic Adviser Larry Lindsay was fired for predicting \nthe war would cost $100 to $200 billion at a time the administration \nsaid it might not cost anything because Iraqi oil would pay for it. \nThat was Mr. Wolfowitz who made that statement. The fact is, they were \nright, the critics were wrong, and we have suffered as a result.\n  There was a failure by the leaders in our Government to see this \ninsurgency that came about in Iraq, that endangered our soldiers and \ndestabilized that country for so long.\n  When Secretary Rumsfeld was asked about the reaction of the \ninsurgents and the uncertainty on the ground, he said:\n\n       Freedom's untidy.\n\n  In fact, the looting was the start of the postinvasion violence that \nhas claimed 94 percent of the American lives lost in Iraq.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld also signed off on another critical strategic \nmisjudgment. The decision after the invasion to immediately disband the \nIraqi Army made it easier for the insurgency.\n  We remember what happened when the Secretary went to Iraq in a \nsurprise visit. Soldiers greeted him. He took questions. The Tennessee \nguardsman asked: Mr. Secretary, why do I have to dig through the dump \nto find pieces of metal to put in my humvee to protect me and my fellow \nsoldiers? Why don't we have modern equipment to protect us on the \nground? The Secretary was at a loss for words. He was embarrassed. \nAmerica should have been embarrassed to send our soldiers into battle \nwithout the equipment they needed.\n  Since the beginning of the war, a troubling pattern has emerged. \nUnder Mr. Rumsfeld's leadership, the Pentagon has been very slow to \nrespond to the needs of our troops in the field.\n  In December 2003, LTG Ricardo Sanchez identified critical shortages \nand protective equipment for our troops and lack of spare parts for \ncombat equipment, providing proof our soldiers were not adequately \nsupplied.\n  By mid-2004, a furor broke out when reports reached Washington, DC, \nthat many humvee vehicles in Iraq did not have armor, and American \nsoldiers and Marines using them were being maimed and killed by IEDs as \na result.\n  Congress flooded Defense budgets with funding for vehicle armor to \nreplace or improve inadequately protected vehicles. Even after news \ncoverage of this lack of planning forced Secretary Rumsfeld to \naccelerate production of the armor, the Pentagon missed at least three \nself-imposed deadlines to fully field armor all of our troops--this \nafter the President told us our mission had been accomplished.\n  A defining moment for Secretary Rumsfeld was when that Tennessee \nguardsman challenged him. Here is what the guardsman asked:\n\n       Why do we soldiers have to dig through local landfills for \n     pieces of scrap metal and compromised ballistic glass to \n     uparmor our vehicles?\n\n  Secretary Rumsfeld replied, in part:\n\n       You have to go to war with the Army you have, not the Army \n     you want.\n\n  That is our Secretary of Defense, speaking of the Army he had, not \nthe Army he wanted.\n  Let me remind everyone the decision to invade was the decision of the \nUnited States of America. We picked the date. We picked the time. We \nestablished when readiness would be adequate. And sadly, it was not.\n  That conversation with the guardsman from Tennessee revealed another \ndestructive tendency. Secretary Rumsfeld has seemingly forgotten about \nthe tremendous role our Guard and Reserve have played in this war and \nmust be prepared to play at home. The condition of the gear and \nequipment from our Guard and Reserve continues to rapidly deteriorate.\n  Last week, I went to the Illinois National Guard Camp Lincoln in \nSpringfield, meeting with the officers and asking them about equipment. \nEighty percent of their men and women and units have been activated in \nIraq. They have left behind wornout, damaged, and destroyed equipment, \nobviously, came back empty-handed, and now do not have the fundamental \nequipment they need to train the guardsman to be able to respond to \ndomestic emergencies in my home State of Illinois. Our situation is not \nunique. Across the United States, Guard and Reserve have only 34 \npercent of the equipment they need in the United States.\n  The true cost of this war is not just in the lives and the injuries \nand the budgets but the fact that we have left our military, our Guard \nand Reserve, ill equipped, unprepared, for the next challenge. That is \na sad condemnation of an administration that did not think through this \ncommitment, that did not understand that mission would not truly be \naccomplished for years and years after the President made that claim.\n  As a result of ``going to war with the Army you have,'' and \ninadequate logistical plans, our Army and Marine units on the ground in \nIraq are continuing to struggle with repairing, rebuilding, and \nreplacing equipment used by up to 3 years of sustained effort.\n  In testimony before Congress last year, U.S. Army GEN Richard Cody, \nthe vice chief of staff of the Army, stated:\n\n       We are equip-stretched, let there no doubt about it . . . \n     this Army started this war not fully equipped.\n\n  What excuse is there for that, that we sent our Army, our Marines, \nall of the men and women in uniform, over to this war without the \nproper equipment?\n  The failures on the part of the Secretary of Defense to bring a large \nenough occupation force to ensure the force was properly equipped or to \nplan for the emergency of full-scale insurgency against United States \nrepresents strategic errors of great significance. The strategic \nblindness continues today.\n  As I said, at least Secretary Rice acknowledges errors were made. \nWhen asked about her statement, Secretary Rumsfeld said:\n\n       I don't know what she was talking about, to be perfectly \n     honest.\n\n  After 3 years of war, Secretary Rumsfeld does not know what the \nSecretary of State is talking about when she says that thousands of \nmistakes were made.\n  We need someone who can recognize the reality before him and \nacknowledge that we need to change course in Iraq.\n  Last fall, the Senate, by a vote of 79 to 19, declared calendar year \n2006 should be a period of significant transition to full Iraqi \nsovereignty, with Iraqi security forces taking the lead for the \nsecurity of a free and sovereign Iraq, thereby creating the conditions \nfor the phased redeployment of U.S. forces.\n  What does that mean? It is time for the Iraqis to stand and govern \ntheir own nation. It is time for the Iraqi people to stand and defend \ntheir own nation. How many years have we been promised that Iraqi \nsoldiers and police were this close to replacing American soldiers? You \nhave a right to be skeptical because we have yet to see the first \nAmerican soldier replaced by an Iraqi soldier taking their place, \nstanding guard for their own country.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld has not been able to create the conditions that \nwill allow for the withdrawal of troops from Iraq. We are a long way \nfrom accomplishing our mission.\n  Early this month, Congress received the first report from the Bush \nadministration required by the year of transition amendment. The \nadministration report offers the same ideological blind spots that led \nto the ``mission accomplished'' claim in 2003. It shows the same lack \nof vision that failed to predict insurgency. There are no mentions of \nmilitia. There is no analysis of the dangers of civil war. They still \nsee only what they want to see.\n\n  I believe Secretary Rumsfeld should resign. But I in no way hold him \nsolely responsible for the decisions on Iraq. After all, he works for \nthe Commander in Chief, the President of the United States.\n  In order to find our way out of this disastrous mess this \nadministration has made in Iraq, the President clearly needs new \nleadership in Defense. And that is not just my opinion. It is the \nopinion of these retired generals--men who have given their lives to \nthis country, men whose hearts were broken as they watched their \nsoldiers and marines killed in battle, men who visited these veterans \nin the hospitals, men who reflected on where we are today\n\n[[Page S3796]]\n\nand how we reached it and came to the same conclusion.\n  We need a new direction. We need new leadership. We need to have \nsomeone in the Department of Defense and a strategy that will lead to \nour troops coming home, the sooner the better.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/01/senate-section/article/S3796-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3796]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 DARFUR\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we will be closing in a few moments. But \nbefore doing that, I want to comment on events carried out in \nWashington yesterday, indeed around the country yesterday, in response \nto a crisis that is going on, a crisis that is more than a crisis. It \nis genocide going on in the Darfur region. It is the western region of \nthe Sudan.\n  Yesterday, roughly 10,000 people gathered in front of the Capitol, on \nthe Mall, to bring attention to what is happening: that crisis, that \ngenocidal campaign that is underway and being perpetrated against the \npeople of Darfur.\n  I applaud all of the participants' compassion and commitment to the \ncause which has been discussed again and again on the floor of the \nSenate but, indeed, is a devastating crisis that is destroying a \npopulation and, indeed, is genocide.\n  This is an issue that is very close to my own heart, in part because \nI travel just about every year to do medical mission work in that part \nof the world, in the Sudan. Indeed, I was in the Darfur area and in \nChad a little over a year ago on the ground.\n  I mention it because this afternoon, several hours ago, I had the \nwonderful opportunity of meeting with a small group of refugees from \nthe Darfur region. The meeting was organized by SaveDarfur.org. It gave \nme the opportunity to visit firsthand with individuals from several of \nthe tribes that occupy the Darfur region.\n  It is interesting, there are 10, 11, 12 tribes throughout Sudan. In \nthe south, two or three tribes dominate. In different parts of the \nSudan, tribes dominate. But it is interesting, over in the Darfur \nregion, the number of tribes that intersect together. It is sort of \nmidway--north-south--in Sudan, so you have a lot of the tribes that are \nmore endemic to the northern part of Sudan, as well as the southern and \neastern part of Sudan. All of them commingle in that region.\n  We met, oh, about 50 yards from here on a balcony overlooking the \nMall. And as you stood on the balcony there, on a beautiful day in \nWashington, looking out, you could not help but think of the contrast \nbetween what is going on in the homeland of those refugees to the \nUnited States from Darfur and that beautiful day looking out upon our \nmonuments and the freedom and liberty for which they stand. That \ncontrast between the turmoil that is going on, as we speak, in Sudan \nand America's homeland peace and prosperity were really felt.\n  I have had the opportunity to go to Sudan a number of times. I have \ntalked to the refugees in the border camps. They are along the western \nborder of Sudan and in the country of Chad, which is to the west of the \nSudan. There are 12 refugee camps. The refugee camps have anywhere from \n8,000 to 20,000 people who are living on a sustenance level, with the \naid of NGOs and peoples around the world, in little tents, makeshift \ntents, but living there, in essence, permanently.\n  There are about 2 million people who have been displaced in the \nDarfur region and about 200,000 people who have died as a result of \nbrutality which leads back to government sponsorship.\n  We have heard again and again the stories and seen pictures of the \nvillages that are set afire, of the women who are raped, the children \nwho are abducted, recruited to armies, and even many executed.\n  The Government of Sudan has failed to take credible steps to date, \nand we need to use everything within our power and our standing in the \ninternational community to convince other people to act and to act now. \nWe cannot--cannot--tolerate this genocide.\n  On this floor we have called it for what it is: genocide. President \nBush has called it genocide. Former Secretary of State Colin Powell has \ncalled it genocide.\n  Last month, before we left for the Easter/Passover recess, I met with \na number of friends from Sudan, many of whom I had gotten to know when \nI was last in Sudan, in the southern part of the Sudan. They had been \nsponsored by a charity out of Knoxville, TN.\n  We talked about the clinics and the hospitals in southern Sudan. And \nwe discussed the pressure the American Government has been able to \nbring to date on behalf of the Darfur people. But there is a lot more \nwe can do. And there is a lot more we should do.\n  Because these individuals were from the southern part of Sudan--that \nis a thousand miles away, a long way away from the Darfur region--they \nreflected how our Government getting involved in the southern part of \nSudan had brought more peace, and it stopped the civil war that had \ngone on there for the last 20 years.\n  One of those visitors, Reverend Kayanga, is a friend, actually, \nsomebody whom I have gotten to know. He said it best when he said, \n``The only people that visited us were your people.'' He was saying \nthat to me, again, reaching out: Thank you for the past. But you need \nto get even more involved as we address this devastating crisis in the \nDarfur part of Sudan.\n  The conflict in the region is huge. First of all, Sudan itself, the \ncountry, is about a third of the size of the continental United States. \nThe Darfur region is vast. The area of conflict is probably a third \nbigger than all of Iraq. So it is a huge area, which is one of the \nchallenges. Things are getting worse, not better, which is the message \nthey were giving me. Indeed, as I talked to people on the ground, in \nterms of NGOs, the NGOs are having a harder time. The rainy season \ncomes in 4 weeks. Once that comes in, there is no way to get aid and \nhave it distributed throughout the Darfur region.\n  As yesterday's rally demonstrated, the American people have vast \nstores of compassion and caring for these people and for the suffering \nof others. We have a passionate commitment to human rights. Now is the \ntime for us to reflect it. At our Government's request, the African \nUnion has agreed to extend the ongoing peace talks until midnight on \nTuesday. Indeed, Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick will leave \ntoday for Abuja, Nigeria, to help both parties resolve the crisis. \nNegotiations have gone on for 2 years, and a settlement is long past \ndue. Those who are responsible for this genocide, for the war crimes \nagainst humanity and criminal acts, need to be brought to justice. No \nlonger can we wait this tragedy out. We must act, and the international \ncommunity must be encouraged to step up as well. Hundreds of thousands \nof lives are at stake.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FRIST. I am happy to.\n  Mr. REID. Just out of curiosity, I know on some of your trips you \nhave taken to care for the poor in these countries, you have done a lot \nof surgery and other things. Have you done any in this area?\n  Mr. FRIST. In the Darfur region I have not. But it is very similar to \nsouthern Sudan. It is fascinating, southern Sudan, where 2 million \npeople have been displaced, and 5 million people have been killed in a \ncivil war there, and it started there. That is why I have great hope. A \nlot of people just give up on these regions, because when we went there \ninitially, it was almost exactly the same. There was a lot of fighting \nwithin 10 or 15 kilometers.\n  I started operating in a little schoolhouse that had been diverted \nfor about 8 years. That was 1997-1998. Now in 2006, there is a village \nthere and commerce and a hospital, no fighting; 50,000 people go \nthrough what was a schoolhouse and is now a big hospital.\n  When people give up in Africa or say we have been through this before \nand talk about corruption in government, we can't give up. We should \nnot give up.\n  I very much appreciate my distinguished colleague asking because \nthere is a lot we can do. And it starts with the compassion and caring \nthat the American people exemplify. Now is the time for us to act.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/01/senate-section/article/S3797-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3797]]\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                       Sergeant Daniel L.

Sesker died on April 6, 2006 near Bayji, Iraq in \nsupport of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Sergeant Sesker was assigned to C \nTroop, 1st Squadron, 113th Calvary Regiment, 34th Infantry Division, \nArmy National Guard based out of Le Mars, IA. I extend my deepest \nsympathies to his mother and stepfather, Mysty and Marvin Stumbo, his \nfather, Dennis Sesker, his brother and sister, and his fiancee Angie.\n  Daniel Sesker was born in Boone, IA, and graduated from Ogden High \nSchool in 2001, where he participated in wrestling. He studied criminal \nlaw at Iowa Central Community College before enlisting in the Army \nNational Guard. He served as part of Kosovo Force in Operation Joint \nGarden and had served a previous tour in Iraq. Between his two tours, \nDaniel worked as a counselor at the Woodward Academy and as a part-time \npolice officer in Gowrie, IA. Sergeant Sesker received several \ndecorations for his exemplary service, including the Bronze Star, \nPurple Heart, Army Commendation Medal, National Defense Medal, Iraq \nCampaign Medal, and Combat Action Badge.\n  Sergeant Sesker is remembered as having a great sense of humor. His \nlove for his family and friends as well as his love for life will be \nmissed by all who knew him. He was the kind of person who could light \nup a room with his personality and positive attitude. My thoughts and \nprayers are with his family and friends.

Mr. President, in May, we commemorate Asian Pacific \nAmerican Heritage Month, honoring the history, culture and traditions \nof Asians and Pacific Americans and recognizing their unique \ncontributions to the United States.\n  First proposed as a 1-week event in 1977, the celebration was \nexpanded to a full month in 1990. May was chosen because of its unique \nsignificance in the history of Asian Americans. May 7, 1843, marked the \nfirst recorded immigration of Japanese to the United States. May 10, \n1869, marked the completion of the transcontinental railroad--a feat \nthat would not have happened when it did without the labor of Chinese \nimmigrants.\n  The Asian and Pacific American population has a rich history in this \ncountry, especially in the Pacific Northwest. In my State, records show \nthe arrival of Asian immigrants as early as the 1860s, while some \nscholars even speculate that centuries before, Chinese explorers sailed \ndown the Alaskan coast to what is now Washington State. Today, there \nare over 14 million Asians and Pacific Americans living in the United \nStates, representing 5 percent of the population. In Washington, they \nmake up 7 percent of the citizenry.\n  Over the past century and a half, Asian and Pacific American \ncommunities have contributed significantly to the cultural vibrancy of \nWashington State. Individuals within Washington's Asian and Pacific \nAmerican communities have also worked to stand up for justice and make \nour country a better place. In 1944, Gordon Hirabayashi, a Japanese \nAmerican student at the University of Washington in Seattle, took a \nstand against the unfair treatment of Japanese Americans during World \nWar II when he refused to obey discriminatory curfew orders. In taking \nhis case to the U.S. Supreme Court, he left a lasting reminder of the \nimportance of standing up for civil rights.\n  Last month, Washington State celebrated the retirement of one of its \nmost influential Asian American leaders. Bob Santos, affectionately \nknown to many as ``Uncle Bob,'' has for many years, tirelessly \ndedicated himself to social justice for all. As a founder and executive \ndirector of Inter*Im Community Development Association, Bob helped \nrevitalize the International District of Seattle, build the local \neconomy, and secure affordable housing for many of our most vulnerable \nresidents. Under President Clinton, Uncle Bob served nobly and boldly \nas the Regional Director for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment. His selflessness, passion and dedication embody the giving \nspirit that makes our Asian Pacific American community so strong.\n  America is a land of immigrants, and our history demonstrates that we \nare stronger because of our diversity. Over the past century and a \nhalf, Asian and Pacific American communities have contributed \nsignificantly to the cultural vibrancy of Washington State. However, we \ncan only live up to the promise of our diversity if we recognize the \nmistakes of our past and give all groups a voice in public discourse. \nDuring World War II, 227 Japanese Americans from Bainbridge Island \nbecame the first of more than 120,000 people to be placed in internment \ncamps. They departed from Bainbridge Island's Eagledale Ferry Dock \nwhich, just last month, became the site of a moving tribute to all \naffected by this dark period. The name of this memorial is Nidoto Nai \nYoni, meaning ``let it not happen again.''\n  During this year's Asian Pacific American Heritage month, we \ncelebrate a history rich with culture and tradition. In our Asian and \nPacific American communities, we must preserve the lessons of the past \nand recognize the great promise of the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/01/senate-section/article/S3797-3", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             HURRICANE RITA\n\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor in the \nRecord the 150th Anniversary of Berrien County, GA.\n  Berrien County was created in 1856 from Coffee, Irwin and Lowndes \ncounties. It was named for a great Georgian, John McPherson Berrien, a \nU.S. Senator who also served as President Andrew Jackson's Attorney \nGeneral. From the area labeled on early Georgia maps simply as ``Pine \nBarrens,'' because of its vast acreage of pine trees, Berrien County \nhas become one of the top agriculture-producing counties in Georgia and \nthe Southeast. Known as the ``Bell Pepper Capital of the World,'' \nBerrien County farmers also have made significant contributions in the \nproduction of cotton, corn, peanuts, livestock, and especially tobacco.\n  During the summer when the tobacco markets opened, hundreds of \nfamilies would come to the county seat of Nashville to market their \ncrop and, in turn, purchase much needed items from area businesses with \nthe money earned from that year's crop. Nashville has two historic \nbuildings on the National Register of Historic Places--the old jail and \nthe Berrien County Courthouse.\n  In addition to Nashville, Berrien County includes the great towns of \nAlapaha, Ray City, and Enigma.\n  It gives me a great deal of pleasure, and it is a privilege to \nrecognize on the floor of the U.S. Senate, the contributions of Berrien \nCounty to the State of Georgia. I congratulate this great county on its \n150th anniversary. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/01/senate-section/article/S3798-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/01/senate-section/article/S3798-3", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/01/senate-section/article/S3798-4", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, today Senator Inouye and I introduce \nthe Communications Act of 2006. Just over a month ago, the Senate \nCommerce Committee concluded a series of 15 hearings on the state of \nour Nation's communications laws. We looked at what changes in the law \nwould be required to spur innovation, encourage competition, and \nprovide better service at a lower price for consumers. Senator Inouye \nand I, and the members of our committee heard from dozens of witnesses \nand still more who have offered comments and suggested language. Our \nstaffs met with literally hundreds of people representing every point \nof view.\n  The measure we introduce today is a working draft intended to \nstimulate discussion and is open for comments and suggestions for \nchange. It attempts to strike a balance between competing industries, \nconsumer groups and local government. Both Senator Inouye and I may \npropose additional changes based on comments offered by our members or \ninterested parties. We will hold two hearings to take testimony on the \ndraft bill and will listen to proposed changes. It is our hope that \nthrough a process of collaboration, we can draft a bill that represents \na bipartisan consensus.\n  The bill includes elements from a number of bills introduced by \nmembers of our committee from both sides of the aisle. The Call Home \nAct that Senator Inouye and I introduced last week would allow the FCC \nto take any action short of price regulation to reduce rates for \nmembers of our Armed Forces who call home. The measure includes \nthirteen cosponsors from our committee and another twenty-five \ncosponsors from the Senate at large. The Call Home Act has been \nendorsed by twenty-five military and veterans organizations.\n\n  The overarching theme of the bill we introduce today is deployment of \nbroadband nationwide. Today the United States is less than 16th in \nadoption of broadband worldwide. We are not only behind most of the \ndeveloped world, we even lag behind some of the less developed parts of \nthe globe. To address this broadband gap, the bill we introduce today \nwill allow local governments to offer their own broadband service, so \nlong as they do not compete unfairly with the private sector. The \nprovision is based largely on Senator McCain's and Lautenberg's bill, \nS. 1294, cosponsored by Senator Kerry, but includes elements to protect \nthe private sector from unfair government competition from Senator \nEnsign's bill, S. 1504 cosponsored by McCain, Lott, DeMint, and Vitter.\n  Senator McCain was also very helpful in crafting the interoperability \nsection of the bill. After Hurricane Katrina and later Wilma and Rita, \nthe committee held a series of hearings on problems communications \ncompanies had in restoring service and the difficulties first \nresponders had in talking to one another even when service had been \nfully restored. During those difficult times, Senators Lott and Vitter \nplayed an important role in highlighting the importance of \ninteroperability in times of crisis. As part of the reconciliation bill \nadopted last December, this committee addressed the interoperability \nproblem by dedicating $1 billion to interoperability programs. However, \nbecause of the Byrd rule, it was not possible to provide guidance on \nhow the money should be spent. The interoperability bill we introduce \ntoday adopts many of the recommendations offered by a variety of groups \nfrom the 911 Commission to the recent White House report. It embraces \nkey concepts such as Planning and interoperable equipment grants which \nhave been discussed with the Department of Homeland Security and \nvarious public safety groups.\n  The bill will also crate prepositioned technology caches in every \nState in the Union with some redundant regional caches for national \nemergencies--an idea offered by Senator Inouye and his staff. These \ncaches will include equipment like satellite telephones that work even \nwhen towers and power lines have been destroyed.\n  Senator Kerry has also been in involved in the interoperability \ndiscussion, and I believe he will have suggestions as we move forward \non how to build redundancy into our communications system.\n  One of the centerpieces of the legislation is video franchising \nreform. The bill is based largely on legislation introduced by Senator \nEnsign, S. 1504, cosponsored by Senators McCain, Lott, DeMint, and \nVitter. Senators Smith and Rockefeller introduced a similar measure. \nConsistent with the Inouye/Burns principles, the measure retains local \nfranchise involvement, but is based off of the Alaska model which uses \nexpedited procedures, consistent with the shot clock principles in the \nInouye/Burns principles.\n\n  By using a standard application, but preserving the cities' right to \nmanage their own rights of way and providing the revenues needed to \noperate their institutional networks as well as their PEG channels, the \nbill seeks to balance the needs of those who want to deploy broadband \nnetworks for video services and the desires of cities to continue the \nservices they offer today. We also sought to address the needs of the \nexisting cable companies by offering them the same terms as new \nentrants immediately upon approval of the competitor's franchise \napplication. Additionally, a cable company can avail itself of the new \nstreamlined rules after its current franchise agreement expires.\n  Another issue addressed in the draft bill is access to video content. \nWhile satellite companies are barred from hoarding exclusive sports \nprogramming, the so-called terrestrial loophole does not impose the \nsame mandate on cable companies. As a result, through acquisition of \nregional sports networks by cable operators, competition with satellite \nproviders is stymied. The Sports Freedom Act included in this bill is \npatterned after a provision in the Ensign bill cosponsored by McCain, \nLott, DeMint, and Vitter.\n  Also critical to providing compelling content is the broadcast flag. \nBroadcasters are reluctant to offer their best programming over the air \nfor fear it could be stolen and distributed worldwide over the Internet \nwith no regard to copyright protection. This has been a critical issue \nfor Senator Inouye on the video side and for Senator Frist on the audio \nside. Senators Smith and Boxer took on this issue and developed a draft \nbill which became the basis for the legislation we introduce today. It \nattempted to strike a balance between the needs of broadcasters and the \ndesires of the consumer electronic industry not to have the Federal \nGovernment pick technology winners and losers. While interested parties \nmay have suggestions for improving the bill, we believe it is a good \nfirst step in addressing their concerns. I commend Senators Smith and \nBoxer for their hard work on this issue.\n  The measure includes a white space provision modeled after S. 2327, \nthe Allen-Kerry WIN Act supported by Senators Sununu, Dorgan, and \nBoxer. It adds some protections the broadcasters requested to prevent \nharmful interference by requiring any new device to be tested in an FCC \ncertified lab before deployment. The concept of using vacant TV \nchannels for broadband deployment through Wi-Fi, Wi-Max and other \ntechnologies is strongly endorsed by consumer groups and the technology \ncommunity. Also, each can play an important role in bringing broadband \nto rural America.\n  The legislation includes guidance on the DTV transition that was not \npossible in the reconciliation bill because of the Byrd rule. Much of \nthe language we included is based on a provision Senator Inouye worked \non to Address consumer education issues. It also includes an \ninternational coordination element requested by Senator Hutchison to \naddress interference on the US-Mexico border that will also\n\n[[Page S3804]]\n\nbenefit other border states, such as Alaska, Washington, Montana, North \nDakota, and Maine. In addition, we have included S. 900, Senator \nMcCain's Television Information Enhancement for the visually impaired \nact which Senator Inouye and I cosponsored, along with Senator Smith. \nThat bill authorizes an existing FCC rule requiring TV stations to \noffer some video description of television shows so blind listeners \nwill be able to follow the action. The existing rule was struck down by \nthe courts on the grounds that the FCC lacked authority for such a \nrule. Today we provide them the authority they need. As the son of a \nfather who was blind for a period of time, this is an issue of personal \ninterest to me.\n\n  Last, but most important to me is universal service reform. Our \nmeasure is based on a series of bills. The contribution mechanism we \nadopted is based on S. 2256, the Burns USF bill and S. 1583, the Smith-\nDorgan measure which was also cosponsored by Senator Pryor. It allows \nthe FCC to adopt a contribution mechanism based on revenues, numbers, \nor connections. Such a step is needed to stabilize this important \nprogram. it also includes Senator Smith's concept of a separate \nbroadband fund to address the needs of unserved areas.\n  We have included S. 241, the Snowe-Rockefeller ADA exemption after \nfailing in our efforts to work out this issue with the Administration. \nWhile the Burns and Smith-Dorgan-Pryor bills were the basis for our USF \ntitle, we also used important concepts from H.R. 5072, the Terry-\nBoucher bill, and we applaud them for their leadership in the House and \nthank them for their contribution to this effort. Lastly, we have \nincluded S. 2378, the Inouye measure that will improve the e-rate \nprogram for Native Americans. Senators McCain, Dorgan, and I joined in \ncosponsoring that bill.\n  This bill includes provisions throughout that will benefit consumers. \nIt encourages competition and cost savings in the video market. It \naddresses some critical needs in rural America. And, it encourages \ndeployment of broadband so that our Nation can remain competitive.\n  This is a comprehensive bill, as indicated by my comments, that we \nhave researched. The bill is introduced by every Member of the Senate. \nWe are attempting to collate them so we can have one communications act \nfor this year. This will be the Communications Act of 2006.\n  I urge the Senate to review it. We look forward to having their \ncomments.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today, I have agreed to cosponsor \ntelecommunications legislation introduced by Senator Stevens. I do so \nin a spirit of bipartisanship because I believe that bipartisanship \nwill be required if we are to successfully update our Nation's \ncommunications laws. My cosponsorship, however, is not a demonstration \nof support for the bill itself.\n  This is the draft of the majority staff, and I have numerous, \nsubstantive objections to the bill in its current form. Given that my \ncolleagues and I have not yet had an opportunity to weigh in on this \ncritical legislation, I consider its introduction the very beginning of \nthe legislative process.\n  Now that the majority staff's draft is no longer a secret, we can \nbegin a full review of the bill and address the many issues important \nto me and my colleagues. At first glance, some provisions will need to \nbe deleted or changed substantially and some issues still need to be \naddressed.\n  For example, we cannot ignore concerns about the potential for \ndiscrimination by network operators, but the draft appears to do just \nthat by failing to create enforceable protections that will ensure \nnetwork neutrality. Similarly, I believe that the provisions addressing \nvideo franchise reform must follow more closely the principles Senator \nBurns and I offered earlier this year. At a time of increasing \nconsolidation in the communications industry, it is essential that we \nguarantee rights of interconnection, promote competition, and restrain \nanticompetitive behavior, particularly in markets where the Bell \nCompanies continue to have significant market power. The legislation \nmust promote the availability of affordable, broadband services and \nextend consumer protections on a competitively neutral basis.\n  Again, I recognize and honor the chairman's prerogative to set this \nlegislative process into motion. The chairman is aware of my many \nconcerns and has assured me that this will be a bipartisan process, and \nthe Democrats will be at the table. I look forward to our discussions, \nand I am hopeful that we can develop a final product that everyone on \nour committee can support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/01/senate-section/article/S3804-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 456--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE \n DISCUSSION BY THE NORTH ATLANTIC COUNCIL OF SECURE, SUSTAINABLE, AND \n                       RELIABLE SOURCES OF ENERGY\n\n  Mr. LUGAR submitted the following resolution, which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution that \ncalls upon the United States to lead the discussion at NATO \nheadquarters of the role the alliance could play in energy security. It \nfurther calls upon the President to submit to Congress a report that \ndetails ``a strategy for NATO to develop secure, sustainable, and \nreliable sources of energy, including contingency plans if current \nenergy resources are put at risk.''\n  NATO is now facing new challenges and new priorities. To be fully \nrelevant to the security and well-being of the people of its member \nnations, NATO must think and act globally.\n  International developments are calling attention to the growing \nimportance of energy security for NATO member countries and other \nnonmember partners. Dependence on imports of oil and natural gas from \nlimited numbers of countries with state-controlled reserves makes NATO \nmember countries vulnerable to political manipulation of supply. On a \nglobal scale, increased competition for finite supplies of oil and gas \ncould lead to conflict that would directly involve NATO member states. \nThis is why the resolution urges that the United States energy security \nmessage to NATO members include attention toward sustainable fuels and \npreparedness for supply disruption.\n  As the alliance focuses on a clearer definition of its purpose in the \n21st century, I believe that it is important to show congressional \nsupport for NATO playing a role in energy security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/01/senate-section/article/S3804-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3804-S3805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 457--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n  CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAVE \n   SERIOUS CONCERNS REGARDING THE RELEASE OF CONVICTED TERRORIST AND \n       MURDERER MOHAMMAD ALI HAMMADI BY THE GOVERNMENT OF GERMANY\n\n  Mr. VITTER (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Craig, and Mr. \nIsakson) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.

Con. Res. 90\n\n       Whereas we must remember that African-Americans are not the \n     only survivors of the transatlantic slave trade;\n       Whereas like the United States, many European nations \n     benefitted greatly from the colonization of Latin America and \n     the Caribbean and their participation in the slave trade;\n       Whereas the story of African descendants in all of the \n     Americas remains untold, leading them to be forgotten, made \n     invisible, and allowed to suffer unjustly;\n       Whereas it is important to acknowledge that as a result of \n     the slave trade and immigration, approximately 80,000,000 to \n     150,000,000 persons of African descent live in Latin America \n     and the Caribbean, making them the largest population of \n     persons of African descent outside of Africa;\n       Whereas Afro-descendants are present in most Latin American \n     countries, including Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, \n     Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, \n     Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela;\n       Whereas the size of Afro-descendant populations varies in \n     range from less than 1 percent in some countries to as much \n     as 30 percent in Colombia and 46 percent in Brazil and make \n     up the majority in some Spanish speaking Caribbean nations, \n     such as Cuba and the Dominican Republic;\n       Whereas Afro-descendant populations have made significant \n     economic, social, and cultural contributions to their \n     countries and the Western Hemisphere from their unfortunate \n     involvement in the transatlantic slave trade to their recent \n     contributions to trade, tourism, and other industries;\n       Whereas although persons of African descent have made \n     significant achievements in education, employment, economic, \n     political, and social spheres in some countries, the vast \n     majority are marginalized--living in impoverished communities \n     where they are excluded from centers of education, \n     government, and basic human rights based upon the color of \n     their skin and ancestry;\n       Whereas Afro-descendants have shorter life expectancies, \n     higher rates of infant mortality, higher incidences of HIV/\n     AIDS, higher rates of illiteracy, and lower incomes than do \n     other populations;\n       Whereas Afro-descendants encounter problems of access to \n     healthcare, basic education, potable water, housing, land \n     titles, credit, equal justice and representation under the \n     law, political representation, and other economic, political, \n     health, and basic human rights; and\n       Whereas skin color and ancestry have led African-Americans \n     in the United States and African descendants in Latin America \n     and the Caribbean to share similar injustices, leading to \n     economic, social, health, and political inequalities: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring),  That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes and honors African descendants in the \n     Americas for their contributions to the economic, social, and \n     cultural fabric of the countries in the Americas, \n     particularly in Latin American and Caribbean societies;\n       (2) recognizes that as a result of their skin color and \n     ancestry, African descendants in the Americas have wrongfully \n     experienced economic, social, and political injustices;\n       (3) urges the President to take appropriate measures to \n     encourage the celebration and remembrance of the achievements \n     of African descendants in the Americas and to resolve \n     injustices suffered by African descendants in the Americas;\n       (4) encourages the United States and the international \n     community to work to ensure\n\n[[Page S3806]]\n\n     that extreme poverty is eradicated, universal education is \n     achieved, quality healthcare is made available, sustainable \n     environmental resources, including land where applicable, is \n     provided, and equal access to justice and representation \n     under the law is granted in Afro-descendant communities in \n     Latin America and the Caribbean; and\n       (5) encourages the United States and the international \n     community to achieve these goals in Latin America and the \n     Caribbean by--\n       (A) promoting research that focuses on identifying and \n     eradicating racial disparities in economic, political, and \n     social spheres;\n       (B) promoting, funding, and creating development programs \n     that focus on Afro-descendant communities;\n       (C) providing technical support and training to Afro-\n     descendant advocacy groups that work to uphold basic human \n     rights in the region;\n       (D) promoting the creation of an international working \n     group that focuses on problems of communities of Afro-\n     descendants in the Americas; and\n       (E) promoting trade and other bilateral and multilateral \n     agreements that take into account the needs of Afro-\n     descendant communities.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a concurrent \nresolution acknowledging African descendants of the transatlantic slave \ntrade throughout the Western Hemisphere, and in particular, Latin \nAmerica and the Caribbean. This resolution would raise awareness about \nthe continued injustices they face and urge the U.S. and the \ninternational community to work to improve the condition of Afro-\ndescendent communities in these regions.\n  Slavery remains a dark stain on human history. Over the past century, \nthis terrible evil has been virtually eliminated in many parts of the \nworld, including in the Western Hemisphere.\n  Here in the United States, we most often speak of slavery as it \nexisted within our borders. But we need to remember that the \ninstitution of slavery extended throughout the Americas.\n  Across the hemisphere, slaves were brought in bondage from Africa, \nenduring extraordinary hardships, brutal maltreatment, and the \ndeprivation of a most fundamental human right--the right to liberty. \nYet, despite this reality, Afro-descendent communities have contributed \na great deal to the countries and communities in which they have lived. \nUnfortunately, though, even today, the many contributions of Afro-\ndescendent communities throughout our hemisphere are underappreciated.\n  Currently, there are approximately 80 million to 150 million \nindividuals of African descent living in Latin America and the \nCaribbean. In some countries, including the Dominican Republic and \nCuba, Afro-descendants actually constitute the majority of the \npopulation. But all too often, they are left marginalized in these \nsocieties.\n  Indeed, individuals of African descent throughout Latin America and \nthe Caribbean suffer disproportionately from a variety of social and \neconomic ills.\n  On average, they have lower incomes and rates of literacy than do \nother populations in the same areas. And while Afro-descendants make up \n30 percent of the population of Latin America, they comprise 60 percent \nof the region's poor.\n  These circumstances severely impact Afro-descended communities in the \nAmericas. Their inhabitants have shorter life spans and higher rates of \ninfant mortality. They suffer from higher rates of HIV/AIDS infection \nthan their compatriots. And many live in deplorable conditions, without \npotable water, access to healthcare, or basic education.\n  The resolution I am submitting today is a companion to a measure \nintroduced by Congressman Charles Rangel in the House of \nRepresentatives. I believe it is an important resolution, which \ncelebrates the contributions of Afro-descendants to the economic, \nsocial, and cultural fabric of our hemisphere, while drawing attention \nto the continued injustices they face.\n  This resolution is a message that more attention needs to be focused \non the continuing plight of Afro-descendants in the hemisphere. Most \nimportantly, it proposes positive initiatives that would enable us to \ntake a step towards alleviating the suffering caused by extreme poverty \nand racial disparities in this hemisphere.\n  Among other things, it encourages the United States and the \ninternational community to invest in critical measures to combat racial \ndisparities, including research into identifying and eradicating the \ncauses of such iniquities; funding for development programs targeted at \nthe needs of Afro-descendent communities; technical assistance for \ngroups advocating for the rights of Afro-descendents; the creation of \nan international working-group focused on the problems facing these \ncommunities; and the promotion of trade agreements that take into \naccount their needs.\n  Individuals of African descent have and will continue to play an \nessential role in the long-term development of our hemisphere. This \nresolution will help to shed some light on the historic injustices they \nhave faced, and will raise awareness about the challenges continuing to \nface them in their daily lives throughout Latin America and the \nCaribbean. Doing so is an important step toward righting a historical \nwrong and paving the way for a more prosperous future. I ask my \ncolleagues for their support in this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/01/senate-section/article/S3806-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3806-S3807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 91--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \n   THE PRESIDENT SHOULD POSTHUMOUSLY AWARD THE PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF \n               FREEDOM TO LEROY ROBERT ``SATCHEL'' PAIGE\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida (for himself, Mr. DeWine, and Mr. Sessions) \nsubmitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of \nmyself,\n\n[[Page S3807]]\n\nand Senators DeWine and Sessions, to submit a resolution expressing the \nsense of Congress that the President posthumously award the \nPresidential Medal of Freedom to Leroy Robert ``Satchel'' Paige in \nrecognition of his amazing talent and contributions to baseball, our \nnational pastime.\n  Satchel Paige was born in Mobile, AL, on July 7, 1906, and has been \ndescribed as one of the greatest baseball pitchers of all time. In \n1933, for example, he pitched 62 consecutive scoreless innings. He won \nfour consecutive Negro League pennants from 1939 to 1942, and a fifth \npennant in 1946. Although Paige spent most of his career in the Negro \nLeagues due to racial segregation, his reputation as an amazing pitcher \nwas known to both Black and White audiences.\n  In 1948, a year after Jackie Robinson integrated major league \nbaseball, Paige was signed to play with the Cleveland Indians, becoming \nthe oldest rookie at age 42 to play at the Major League level.\n  On August 20, 1948, as Paige pitched the Indians to a 1-0 victory \nover the White Sox, the night game's attendance, 78,382, set a record \nthat still stands today. The Cleveland Indians went on to win the \nAmerican League Championship and the World Series in 1948.\n  In his career, Paige threw an estimated 300 career shutouts. In 1971, \nhe became the first Negro League player inducted into the Major League \nBaseball Hall of Fame. As one of the greatest players of the 20th \ncentury, he was nominated to the All Century Team by Major League \nBaseball, and was selected by the Postal Service as one of the 50 \nLegends of Baseball.\n  Satchel Paige passed away on June 8, 1982, but his talent and \nelectric style of play are still remembered by baseball fans today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/01/senate-section/article/S3807-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3807-S3808]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3728.

(a) Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States is the largest oil importer in the \n     world;\n       (2) the Federal Government predicts that, by 2025, 68 \n     percent of the oil used in the United States will be \n     imported;\n       (3) \\2/3\\ of the oil reserves of the world are located in \n     the politically unstable Middle East and are controlled by \n     members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries;\n       (4) global fuel consumption is projected to increase by 100 \n     percent to 150 percent during the next 20 years, driven \n     largely by the Chinese and Indian economies;\n       (5) that increased demand for fuel--\n       (A) will place the United States in ever-greater \n     competition for oil and gas resources; and\n       (B) may result in an extension of Chinese involvement in \n     developing Cuban oil and gas reserves to within a few miles \n     of the coastline of the United States;\n       (6) the United States adheres to the principle that, in a \n     case in which the exclusive economic zone of the United \n     States is contiguous to the exclusive economic zone of \n     another country, a point equidistant to the maritime \n     baselines of the 2 countries demarcates the exclusive \n     economic zone of each;\n       (7) an example of the application of the principle \n     described in paragraph (6) is that the exclusive economic \n     zone of Cuba extends to within--\n       (A) 52 miles of the Florida Keys at--\n       (i) south of 24 degrees north latitude; and\n       (ii) east of -81 degrees west longitude; and\n       (B) 85.4 miles of the Florida peninsula at--\n       (i) south of 24 degrees north latitude; and\n       (ii) east of -81 degrees west longitude;\n       (8) Cubapetroleo, the state oil company of Cuba, recently--\n       (A) signed an oil production sharing agreement with the \n     China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation; and\n       (B) purchased 3 deep-water drilling rigs from that Chinese \n     state enterprise for use in the exclusive economic zone of \n     Cuba;\n       (9) the exclusive economic zone of Cuba in the Gulf of \n     Mexico is a 112,000-square-kilometer area that has been \n     divided into 59 exploration blocks, each of which is \n     approximately 2,000 square kilometers and an average depth of \n     2,000 meters (except that some of those blocks have a depth \n     of as great as 4,000 meters);\n       (10) the northernmost of the exploration blocks described \n     in paragraph (9) are located off the southwest coast of the \n     State of Florida;\n       (11) a United States Geological Survey report entitled \n     ``Assessment of Undiscovered Oil and Gas Resources of the \n     North Cuba Basin 2004'' estimated that between 1,000,000,000 \n     and 9,300,000,000 barrels of undiscovered oil and between \n     1,900,000,000,000 and 22,000,000,000,000 cubic feet of \n     undiscovered natural gas along the northern coast of Cuba;\n       (12) the national security strategy of the President \n     recognizes the increasing resource needs of China by stating \n     that China is ``expanding trade, but acting as if they can \n     somehow lock up energy supplies around the world or seek to \n     direct markets rather than opening them up.'';\n       (13) the United States embargo on Cuba prohibits United \n     States companies from engaging in the exploration or \n     extraction of hydrocarbon resources from the exclusive \n     economic zone of Cuba;\n       (14) United States oil and gas industries are the world's \n     leaders in the efficient and environmentally-safe extraction \n     of oil and gas resources from marine deposits; and\n       (15) it is in the energy, national security, and \n     environmental interests of the United States that the oil and \n     gas companies of the United States be permitted to operate in \n     the foreign exclusive economic zones that is contiguous to \n     the exclusive economic zone of the United States.\n       (b) The purpose of this section is to permit United States \n     companies to participate in the exploration for and the \n     extraction of hydrocarbon resources from any portion of a \n     foreign maritime exclusive economic zone that is contiguous \n     to the exclusive economic zone of the United States.\n       (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law (including a \n     regulation), United States\n\n[[Page S3817]]\n\n     companies (including agents and affiliates of those \n     companies) may--\n       (1) engage in any transaction necessary for the exploration \n     for and extraction of hydrocarbon resources from any portion \n     of any foreign exclusive economic zone that is contiguous to \n     the exclusive economic zone of the United States; and\n       (2) export without license authority all equipment \n     necessary for the exploration for or extraction of \n     hydrocarbon resources described in paragraph (1).\n       (d) Section 910 of the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export \n     Enhancement Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7209) is amended by \n     inserting after subsection (b) the following:\n       ``(c) General License Authority for Travel-Related \n     Expenditures by Persons Engaging in Hydrocarbon Exploration \n     and Extraction Activities.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall, \n     authorize under a general license the travel-related \n     transactions listed in section 515.560(c) of title 31, Code \n     of Federal Regulations, for travel to, from or within Cuba in \n     connection with exploration for and the extraction of \n     hydrocarbon resources in any part of a foreign maritime \n     Exclusive Economic Zone that is contiguous to the United \n     States' Exclusive Economic Zone.\n       ``(2) Persons authorized.--Persons authorized to travel to \n     Cuba under this section include full-time employees, \n     executives, agents, and consultants of oil and gas producers, \n     distributors, and shippers.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3771.

Mr. SANTORUM submitted an amendment intended to be proposed \nby him to the bill H.R. 4939, making emergency supplemental \nappropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2006, and for \nother purposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       On page 253, between lines 19 and 20, insert the following:\n\n\n               DEMOCRACY PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES IN IRAN\n\n       Sec. 7032. (a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The people of the United States have long demonstrated \n     an interest in the well-being of the people of Iran, dating \n     back to the 1830s.\n       (2) Famous Americans such as Howard Baskerville, Dr. Samuel \n     Martin, Jane E. Doolittle, and Louis G. Dreyfus, Jr., made \n     significant contributions to Iranian society by furthering \n     the educational opportunities of the people of Iran and \n     improving the opportunities of the less fortunate citizens of \n     Iran.\n       (3) Iran and the United States were allies following World \n     War II, and through the late 1970s Iran was as an important \n     regional ally of the United States and a key bulwark against \n     Soviet influence.\n       (4) In November 1979, following the arrival of Mohammed \n     Reza Shah Pahlavi in the United States, a mob of students and \n     extremists seized the United States Embassy in Tehran, Iran, \n     holding United States diplomatic personnel hostage until \n     January 1981.\n       (5) Following the seizure of the United States Embassy, \n     Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, leader of the repressive \n     revolutionary movement in Iran, expressed support for the \n     actions of the students in taking American citizens hostage.\n       (6) Despite the presidential election of May 1997, an \n     election in which an estimated 91 percent of the electorate \n     participated, control of the internal and external affairs of \n     the Islamic Republic of Iran is still exercised by the courts \n     in Iran and the Revolutionary Guards, Supreme Leader, and \n     Council of Guardians of the Government of Iran.\n       (7) The election results of the May 1997 election and the \n     high level of voter participation in that election \n     demonstrate that the people of Iran favor economic and \n     political reforms and greater interaction with the United \n     States and the Western world in general.\n       (8) Efforts by the United States to improve relations with \n     Iran have been rebuffed by the Government of Iran.\n       (9) The Clinton Administration eased sanctions against Iran \n     and promoted people-to-people exchanges, but the Leader of \n     the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Militant \n     Clerics' Society, the Islamic Coalition Organization, and \n     Supporters of the Party of God have all opposed efforts to \n     open Iranian society to Western influences and have opposed \n     efforts to change the dynamic of relations between the United \n     States and Iran.\n       (10) For the past two decades, the Department of State has \n     found Iran to be the leading sponsor of international \n     terrorism in the world.\n       (11) In 1983, the Iran-sponsored Hezbollah terrorist \n     organization conducted suicide terrorist operations against \n     United States military and civilian personnel in Beirut, \n     Lebanon, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of Americans.\n       (12) The United States intelligence community and law \n     enforcement personnel have linked Iran to attacks against \n     American military personnel at Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia \n     in 1996 and to al Qaeda attacks against civilians in Saudi \n     Arabia in 2004.\n       (13) According to the Department of State's Patterns of \n     Global Terrorism 2001 report, ``Iran's Islamic Revolutionary \n     Guard Corps and Ministry of Intelligence and Security \n     continued to be involved in the planning and support of \n     terrorist acts and supported a variety of groups that use \n     terrorism to pursue their goals,'' and ``Iran continued to \n     provide Lebanese Hizballah and the Palestinian rejectionist \n     groups--notably HAMAS, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the \n     [Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General \n     Command]--with varying amounts of funding, safehaven, \n     training and weapons''.\n       (14) Iran currently operates more than 10 radio and \n     television stations broadcasting in Iraq that incite violent \n     actions against United States and coalition personnel in \n     Iraq.\n       (15) The current leaders of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei \n     and Hashemi Rafsanjani, have repeatedly called upon Muslims \n     to kill Americans in Iraq and install a theocratic regime in \n     Iraq.\n       (16) The Government of Iran has admitted pursuing a \n     clandestine nuclear program, which the United States \n     intelligence community believes may include a nuclear weapons \n     program.\n       (17) The Government of Iran has failed to meet repeated \n     pledges to arrest and extradite foreign terrorists in Iran.\n       (18) The United States Government believes that the \n     Government of Iran supports terrorists and extremist \n     religious leaders in Iraq with the clear intention of \n     subverting coalition efforts to bring peace and democracy to \n     Iraq.\n       (19) The Ministry of Defense of Iran confirmed in July 2003 \n     that it had successfully conducted the final test of the \n     Shahab-3 missile, giving Iran an operational intermediate-\n     range ballistic missile capable of striking both Israel and \n     United States troops throughout the Middle East and \n     Afghanistan.\n       (b) Congress declares that it should be the policy of the \n     United States--\n       (1) to support efforts by the people of Iran to exercise \n     self-determination over the form of government of their \n     country; and\n       (2) to actively support a national referendum in Iran with \n     oversight by international observers and monitors to certify \n     the integrity and fairness of the referendum.\n       (c)(1) The President is authorized, notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, to provide financial and political \n     assistance (including the award of grants) to foreign and \n     domestic individuals, organizations, and entities that \n     support democracy and the promotion of democracy in Iran. \n     Such assistance includes funding for--\n       (A) the Broadcasting Board of Governors for efforts to \n     cultivate and support independent broadcasters that broadcast \n     into Iran;\n       (B) cultural and student exchanges;\n       (C) the promotion of human rights and civil society \n     activities in Iran; and\n       (D) assistance to student organizations, labor unions, and \n     trade associations in Iran.\n       (2) It is the sense of Congress that financial and \n     political assistance under this section be provided to an \n     individual, organization, or entity that--\n       (A) opposes the use of terrorism;\n       (B) advocates the adherence by Iran to nonproliferation \n     regimes for nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and \n     materiel;\n       (C) is dedicated to democratic values and supports the \n     adoption of a democratic form of government in Iran;\n       (D) is dedicated to respect for human rights, including the \n     fundamental equality of women;\n       (E) works to establish equality of opportunity for people; \n     and\n       (F) supports freedom of the press, freedom of speech, \n     freedom of association, and freedom of religion.\n       (3) The President may provide assistance under this \n     subsection using amounts made available pursuant to the \n     authorization of appropriations under paragraph (7).\n       (4) Not later than 15 days before each obligation of \n     assistance under this subsection, and in accordance with the \n     procedures under section 634A of the Foreign Assistance Act \n     of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2394-l), the President shall notify the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the Senate and the Committee on \n     International Relations and the Committee on Appropriations \n     of the House of Representatives.\n       (5) It is the sense of Congress that in order to ensure \n     maximum coordination among Federal agencies, if the President \n     provides the assistance under this section, the President \n     should appoint an individual who shall--\n       (A) serve as special assistant to the President on matters \n     relating to Iran; and\n       (B) coordinate among the appropriate directors of the \n     National Security Council on issues regarding such matters.\n       (6) It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (A) support for a transition to democracy in Iran should be \n     expressed by United States representatives and officials in \n     all appropriate international fora;\n       (B) representatives of the Government of Iran should be \n     denied access to all United States Government buildings;\n\n[[Page S3818]]\n\n       (C) efforts to bring a halt to the nuclear weapons program \n     of Iran, including steps to end the supply of nuclear \n     components or fuel to Iran, should be intensified, with \n     particular attention focused on the cooperation regarding \n     such program--\n       (i) between the Government of Iran and the Government of \n     the Russian Federation; and\n       (ii) between the Government of Iran and individuals from \n     China, Malaysia, and Pakistan, including the network of Dr. \n     Abdul Qadeer (A. Q.) Khan; and\n       (D) officials and representatives of the United States \n     should--\n       (i) strongly and unequivocally support indigenous efforts \n     in Iran calling for free, transparent, and democratic \n     elections; and\n       (ii) draw international attention to violations by the \n     Government of Iran of human rights, freedom of religion, \n     freedom of assembly, and freedom of the press.\n       (7) There is authorized to be appropriated to the \n     Department of State $100,000,000 to carry out activities \n     under this subsection.\n       (d) Not later than 15 days before designating a democratic \n     opposition organization as eligible to receive assistance \n     under subsection (b), the President shall notify the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the Senate and the Committee on \n     International Relations and the Committee on Appropriations \n     of the House of Representatives of the proposed designation. \n     The notification may be in classified form.\n       (e)(1) Of the amount appropriated by chapter 2 of title I \n     under the heading ``DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND RELATED AGENCY'', \n     excluding funds appropriated for Educational and Cultural \n     Exchange Programs and Public Diplomacy Programs, $42,750,000 \n     shall be available for the Broadcasting Board of Governors \n     for democracy programs and activities in Iran.\n       (2) Of the amount appropriated by chapter 4 of title I, \n     $47,250,000 shall be made available for the Democracy Fund \n     for democracy programs and activities in Iran.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3773.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 457, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 457) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate that the citizens of the United States and the United \n     States Government have serious concerns regarding the release \n     of convicted terrorist and murderer Mohammad Ali Hammadi by \n     the Government of Germany.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. Res. 457, \nexpressing the Senate's disappointment with the government of Germany \nconcerning their release of convicted terrorist and murderer Mohammad \nAli Hammadi.\n  The German government in December of 2005 released Mohammad Ali \nHammadi, a Hezbollah leader who killed U.S. Navy diver Robert Dean \nStethem in the June 1985 Hezbollah hijacking of TWA Flight 847. \nCoincidentally, a few days later Susanne Osthoff, a German hostage was \nreleased. Mr. Stethem was savagely beaten and then executed for \nrefusing the demands of his hijackers. Hammadi and his fellow \nterrorists escaped, but Hammadi was eventually arrested in Germany in \n1987 for traveling with liquid explosives and sentenced to life in \nprison for the murder of Mr. Stethem. Hammadi's other accomplices are \nstill part of the FBI's most wanted list and have a 15 million dollar \nbounty on their heads.\n  The German government released Hammadi despite a U.S. request for his \nextradition to face numerous charges of terrorism. He was sentenced to \nlife yet only served 18 years. Furthermore, despite our longstanding \nagreement to honor each others' extradition requests the German \ngovernment flew Hammadi to Lebanon to reunite with his brothers who are \nsenior Hezbollah leaders. The Germans did this despite knowing the \nUnited States does not have an extradition treaty with the government \nof Lebanon.\n  Sadly, the family of United States Navy diver Robert Dean Stethem was \nnot notified in advance of Mr. Hammadi's release. Mr. Stethem is an \nAmerican hero who was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star and Purple \nHeart and is buried at Arlington National Cemetery. He also has a \nUnited States Navy ship named in his honor called the USS Stethem.\n  We should continue to call on Lebanon to hand over Hammadi and other \nwanted terrorists to face trial in the United States, and we urge \nLebanon to comply with such requests in order to help foster better \nrelations between the United States and Lebanon. While the United \nStates should continue to assist Lebanon in democratic reform \ninitiatives, we must see results in denying refuge to some of the \nworld's most wanted terrorists. The people of Lebanon have made great \nstrides in recent times but the government of Lebanon must understand \nthat continuing to harbor terrorists will only further isolate them \nfrom the international community and put future financial aid in doubt.\n  The murderers of Robert Stethem must be brought to justice, and a \nclear message must be sent that the brutal murder of American service \nmembers or civilians will neither be tolerated nor forgotten.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 457) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 457\n\n       Whereas, although the Government of Germany has been a \n     significant partner in combating international terrorism, \n     their release of Mohammad Ali Hammadi was a grave and \n     unfortunate mistake;\n       Whereas, in 1985, Mr. Hammadi, along with Hasan Izz-Al-Din, \n     Ali Atwa, and Imad Fayez Mugniyah, hijacked Trans World \n     Airlines Flight 847, and subsequently escaped from the scene \n     of the hijacking;\n       Whereas United States Navy Petty Officer Robert Dean \n     Stethem was singled out during the hijacking of Trans World \n     Airlines Flight 847 because he was a serviceman of the United \n     States, savagely beaten before being executed, and dumped on \n     the tarmac of Beirut International Airport;\n       Whereas Petty Officer Stethem was posthumously awarded the \n     Bronze Star and Purple Heart and buried at Arlington National \n     Cemetery;\n\n[[Page S3847]]\n\n       Whereas, in 1987, Mr. Hammadi was arrested at Frankfurt \n     Airport while carrying liquid explosives in his luggage;\n       Whereas, in 1989, Mr. Hammadi, a Shiite militant from \n     Lebanon, was convicted in a court in Germany for the brutal \n     killing of Petty Officer Stethem and was sentenced to life in \n     prison in Germany;\n       Whereas, after less than 19 years behind bars Mr. Hammadi \n     was released in December 2005 and flown to Lebanon by the \n     Government of Germany even though the United States does not \n     have an extradition treaty with the Government of Lebanon; \n     and\n       Whereas the release of Mr. Hammadi came in the face of \n     strong opposition from the United States Government, and \n     Petty Officer Stethem's parents were not even informed in \n     advance that the killer of their son was to be released; Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the unfortunate actions of the Government of Germany \n     with respect to Mohammad Ali Hammadi have undermined the \n     joint efforts by the United States Government and the \n     Government of Germany to effectively combat international \n     terrorism;\n       (2) the early release of Mr. Hammadi sends a signal of \n     weakness to terrorist groups such as Hezbollah and could \n     increase the likelihood of further terrorist attacks against \n     the citizens of Europe and the rest of the world;\n       (3) the United States Government should continue to call on \n     the Government of Lebanon to hand over Mr. Hammadi and other \n     known terrorists so that they may face trial in the United \n     States;\n       (4) the United States Government should take all \n     appropriate steps to secure the arrest of Mr. Hammadi and his \n     fellow hijackers and their transfer to the United States for \n     trial; and\n       (5) the murderers of United States Navy Petty Officer \n     Robert Dean Stethem must be brought to justice, and a clear \n     message must be sent to the international community that the \n     brutal murder of service members or civilians of the United \n     States will neither be tolerated nor forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/01/senate-section/article/S3847-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3847-S3848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nMAKING EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING \n                     SEPTEMBER 30, 2006--Continued\n\n\n        Amendments Nos. 3791; 3648, as Modified; 3630; and 3631\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate completes its business today, it stand in adjournment until 9:45 \na.m. on Tuesday, May 2. I further ask that following the prayer and the \npledge, the morning hour be deemed to have expired, the Journal of the \nProceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be \nreserved, and the Senate proceed to a period of morning business for up \nto 1 hour, with the first 30 minutes under the control of the \nDemocratic leader or his designee and the final 30 minutes under the \ncontrol of the majority leader or his designee; that upon the use or \nyielding back of the time, the Senate proceed to the consideration of \nH.R. 4939 and immediately proceed to a vote on the motion to invoke \ncloture. I further ask unanimous consent that second-degree amendments \nbe filed by 10:30 a.m. tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there will be time, of course, for debate \nprior to the vote; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. This unanimous consent agreement supersedes \nthat agreement.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think prior to this vote, we should have \ntime to talk about it. The hour is set aside for morning business?\n  Mr. FRIST. The unanimous consent request, Mr. President, was that the \nSenate proceed to a period for morning business--we are calling it \nmorning business--for up to an hour, a total of an hour, with 30 \nminutes under the control of the Democratic leader and 30 minutes under \nmy control, which allows us to be on the bill.\n  Mr. REID. Parliamentary inquiry: What time would that vote take place \napproximately?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Approximately at 10:45 a.m. if all time is \nused.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I asked consent that second-degree \namendments be filed by 10:30 a.m. tomorrow, and that unanimous consent \nrequest is still pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it will probably be more likely around 11\n\n[[Page S3849]]\n\no'clock or 10:50, 10:55 tomorrow morning, maybe 11 o'clock, that we \nwill have the cloture vote on the emergency supplemental appropriations \nbill. That will be the first vote of the day, and that is when the \nclock will start ticking.\n  Remember, Senators have a filing deadline for any second-degree \namendments at 10:30 tomorrow morning. We have a lot of amendments to \nwork through over the course of the postcloture time and will likely be \nhaving votes throughout the day. I know a number of people will be \ncoming up to push votes until after committee meetings and hearings. We \nhave to keep effectively and efficiently going through the votes in \nthis postcloture period. I do expect cloture to be invoked, and we will \nneed to vote on those pending amendments which are qualified under the \ncloture rule.\n  It is my expectation to continue to run postcloture on Tuesday and \nWednesday until we complete the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/01/senate-section/article/S3849-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:45 A.M.
