Senators \nshould expect votes throughout the course of the day. As I mentioned \nall week, if we cannot finish the bill today, we will be voting on the \nbill tomorrow. But I would encourage people to allow us to finish \ntoday.\n  We will have done, after we complete this bill, 11 appropriations \nbills. I thank once again Chairman Thad Cochran for his tremendous \nleadership, as well as his entire committee, in leading forth on these \nappropriations bills. We do have one remaining bill, the Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill, and I plan on going to that bill following the \ncompletion of the Transportation-Treasury bill. I thank my colleagues \nfor the progress we have made over the course of the week, and on all \nthese appropriations bills.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/20/senate-section/article/S11601-7", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11601-S11602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PRESIDENT MAHMOUD ABBAS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on a separate issue, today, several of my \nSenate colleagues and I will be hosting Palestinian President Mahmoud \nAbbas and members of his Cabinet here in the United States Capitol.\n  I have met with President Abbas on several occasions, most recently \nduring my trip to the Middle East in May and his visit to Washington \nlater that month a few weeks after our visit there.\n  President Abbas is here to discuss ways to move the Middle East peace \nprocess forward, and how both sides can fulfill their obligations under \nthe roadmap.\n  Less than 2 months ago, Israel completed its disengagement of \nsettlers and soldiers from all 21 settlements in the Gaza Strip and \nfour settlements in the northern West Bank. The disengagement was \nconducted in a smooth and generally peaceful manner. This was a bold \nand courageous move by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.\n  Now President Abbas and the Palestinian Authority face the challenge \nof creating a secure and stable environment in Gaza. It is vital, it is \ncritical that they succeed. The Palestinian people need to feel \ntangible improvements in their everyday lives, in their daily welfare, \nand they need to see that only peaceful dialog and negotiation can lead \nto a more prosperous future.\n  While coordination between the Israelis and Palestinians during the \ndisengagement was not ideal, it did exist. Prior to the withdrawal, \nIsraeli and Palestinian security officials worked to ensure a peaceful \ndisengagement and to establish a basis for returning to the roadmap.\n  Recently, however, events in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip have\n\n[[Page S11602]]\n\ntaken a turn for the worse. Rocket attacks on Israel continued to be \nlaunched from the Gaza Strip. In the last 9 months, 219 Palestinians \nhave died in internecine clashes. In the West Bank city of Ramallah, \nHamas has claimed responsibility for abducting and killing an Israeli \nsettler after issuing demands for the release of Palestinian prisoners. \nThis past weekend, three Jewish settlers were killed and five were \nwounded in shootings in the West Bank. The Al Aqsa Martyr's Brigade has \nclaimed responsibility for these attacks.\n  These events threaten to derail the peace process and to move both \nsides backward. We have reached a critical juncture in the Middle East \npeace process. The Israeli disengagement from Gaza offers a tremendous \nopportunity to get the peace process and the roadmap back on track. To \nsucceed, both sides must fulfill their responsibilities, but this \nrequires a secure environment in order to act.\n  For the Palestinians, this means ending incitement, dismantling the \nterrorist groups, and disarming the militias. This is what I will \nimpress on President Abbas when I meet with him later today. The \nviolence must be renounced, and it must end. Making progress on these \nissues can set the stage for Israel to move forward on the release of \nPalestinian prisoners and relieving restrictions on travel.\n  I commend President Abbas for his leadership. He has made measurable \nprogress in advancing internal reforms in the Palestinian Authority. \nMore is clearly needed, though, and more must be done.\n  For example, the PA security forces must be reformed, unified, and \ngiven the mandate to enforce the rule of law and establish order in the \nWest Bank and Gaza. President Abbas needs and deserves our continued \nsupport, and the Congress has provided the funding to help the \nPalestinian people and make reform a reality.\n  The United States remains committed to President Bush's vision of two \ndemocratic states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace \nand security. We will continue to work with both parties to fulfill \ntheir obligations under the roadmap toward a true and lasting peace.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly to highlight again \nthe Homeland Security bill, which this body passed and the House passed \nand the President signed this week. I think it is important when we do \nsomething that is substantive and addresses what I see--and I think \nmost people see--as a very significant issue for our Nation, which is \ncontrolling our borders, we should talk about it a little bit so the \npeople understand what we did because in the activities that so \ndominate the daily news--whether it is a hurricane or the issues in \nrelation to a Supreme Court nominee--things that are moving in the \nright direction tend to get lost. But what is moving in the right \ndirection right now is our attempts as a nation, with the President's \nleadership and this Congress's aggressiveness, in the area of trying to \ncontrol our borders.\n  The Homeland Security appropriations bill--and I have the good \nfortune to chair the Homeland Security Subcommittee and the ranking \nmember is Senator Byrd--I do not think of him as the ranking member; \nquite honestly, I think of him as the senior member--is a bill that is \nstructured around the theory that we should address threat.\n  It was a unique approach to an appropriations bill because it is a \nunique issue. Most appropriations bills take on a variety of different \nquestions and the management of the Government and how the Government \nis functioning. But we decided to do the bill based on a theme, to be \nquite honest. The theme we tried to address was: What is the threat? \nAnd how can we best address it?\n\n  We concluded that the prime threats are, No. 1, the use of a weapon \nof mass destruction against our Nation. I intend to talk about that \nissue later on as we move into the new BioShield bill, which has been \nput together by Senator Burr from North Carolina. He has done such an \nextraordinary job. This bill did make major initiatives in the area of \ntrying to fight the use of a weapon of mass destruction and getting \nprepared to deal with that type of a threat.\n  The second major threat we determined was the porousness of our \nborders. The simple fact is too many people are coming into this \ncountry today whom we don't know, and they are coming in illegally. Not \nonly that, but we don't know, when people come across the border \nlegally, who they are and what their purposes are and whether they may \nbe wanting to cause us harm.\n  We have two major problems. We have the problem relative to people. \nIn addition, we have the problem relative to cargo. The fact is, our \nports of entry are basically open to allowing in cargo that may be a \nthreat to us, cargo which might have in it a weapon which might be used \nagainst us.\n  So this bill reallocated resources, and we made some very difficult \ndecisions. We took significant resources from other accounts, where it \ncould arguably be claimed they were needed, but we decided, in the \nelements of priority, it was more important to move the funds into the \nborder issues and move those dollars to the border.\n  We expanded--working in the context of a continuum because we had \ndone a supplemental earlier which attempted to address the same issues \nas part of a package--working as a theme, the issue of protecting our \nborders and making them more secure. We did this by significantly \nexpanding the number of feet on the ground because when you come right \ndown to it, it is how many people you have on the borders looking for \npeople who are trying to come across the borders illegally which \ndetermines whether you are going to be successful in stopping those \npeople.\n  So we expanded by 15 percent, approximately, the number of Border \nPatrol agents. Now, this is only a step in the right direction, but it \nis a fairly significant step. Some would say: Why didn't you put even \nmore Border Patrol agents into the system? Well, quite honestly, the \nsystem cannot handle it. We do not have the training capacity to train \nmore than about 1,500 Border Patrol agents every year. Unfortunately, \nit is very hard to find people to do this job who meet the \nqualifications we have because the qualifications are very high and the \npeople who do this job of serving in our Border Patrol agency are \nindividuals who are highly sought after by other agencies and they are \npeople who have other opportunities. To attract them into the Border \nPatrol agency is a challenge. Finding people is a challenge. But we \nhave put in the pipeline now the dollars necessary to add 1,500 new \nagents.\n  In addition, we are expanding the training facilities so that as we \nmove into the later years, we will be able to train more than 1,500 \nagents a year. My goal--and I believe the goal of other members of the \ncommittee, some of whom are in the Chamber today--is to be training \napproximately 2,000 new agents every year, until we get to 10,000 new \nagents from the baseline of about 10,000. So we will have essentially a \nforce we have doubled.\n  But as you double the force of agents, you also have to double the \ninfrastructure that supports them, or dramatically increase it, anyway. \nSo this bill also addresses that. It builds new facilities. And \nespecially it addresses the issue of detention, which is a critical \nissue for us because we simply know today that as we catch people who \ncome into our country who are not Mexican and whose purposes we don't \nknow but who we know are here illegally, we are not able to detain \nthem.\n  We are not able to send them back to their country of origin because \nwe do not have the capacity to do so. This bill, again, tries to \naddress that issue and does so in a fairly aggressive way, adding, when \ncoupled with the supplemental, approximately 2,000 new beds to \ndetention capability, getting us over 20,000 beds in detention \ncapability. Our goal--and we are on this path now--is\n\n[[Page S11603]]\n\nto be sure that we can detain everybody who comes into this country \nillegally and we catch who is not Mexican and be able to send those \npeople back to where they came from because those people may be a \nsignificant threat to us as a nation.\n  We are making progress. The Congress and the President have made a \ncommitment to significantly increase our capacity to protect our \nborders. We recognize that there is a porousness among our borders, and \nwe have stepped up, in an attempt to try to address that, by \ndramatically expanding the resources we are putting on the borders and \ndramatically expanding the support facilities for those border agents \nwho are there.\n  There are other issues that we still need to address: Specifically, \nour computer capability as to how we track legal people who come into \nthe country and our capacity to have the various computer systems which \nare able to track people--the FBI system at IAFIS and the US-VISIT \nsystem set up by Customs and Immigration--be able to communicate in a \nway which makes it possible for us to identify somebody coming into \nthis country who might have a criminal record or for purposes which we \nbelieve could harm our Nation or individuals in our Nation.\n  There is a long way to go in that area. We intend to continue to \nfocus a great deal of energy and resources on that also. I intend to \nhold hearings specifically on that point because I am very concerned \nabout it. This bill, which passed the Senate and passed the House and \nwas signed by the President this week, called the Homeland Security \nappropriations bill, was a significant step in the right direction \ntoward making our borders more secure. It is a step which should be \nacknowledged and, therefore, I wanted to come to the floor to note it \nagain.\n  I thank the Chair and the Senator from Michigan for her courtesy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/20/senate-section/article/S11603-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski).

Let me say that my colleague from \nWashington, Senator Murray, and I are hoping to finish business today. \nI know there are a number of amendments out there that people wish to \nbring up. We have been able to accept a significant number of them. If \nyou have an amendment pending, please come down this morning and talk \nto us. I hope we will stay around however long it takes to finish up \nall of these matters and have a final vote. This bill has to go to \nconference, if we are to provide 2006 appropriations for the very \nimportant agencies covered by this legislation. This is going to be a \ndifficult bill to conference, and we must have this bill finished, \nready for the floor, I would hope before the end of this month so that \nthey can get out from under a continuing resolution. But we must get it \nfinished before Thanksgiving. It is vitally important. I urge Members \nto come to the floor. If they don't want to act on all of their \namendments, that will be fine with us. We need to get this bill \nfinished.\n\n\n                 Congratulations to the Houston Astros\n\n  On a personal note, I conclude by saying our congratulations to the \nHouston Astros, who are a magnificent team. They did well. We are \nlooking forward to a great battle between them and the White Sox, a \ncentral time zone World Series which many of us in the heartland think \nis going to be good. The St. Louis Cardinals were magnificent for over \n100 games. But Busch Stadium, twice now, has failed us in October.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide resources to the Administration so that the \n Administration can enforce existing trade agreements and obligations \n     related to trade violations involving currency manipulation, \n counterfeiting of manufactured products, and pirating of intellectual \n                               property)\n\n       On page 277, line 18, strike ``activities;'' and insert the \n     following: ``activities; pursuant to section 3004(b) of the \n     Exchange Rates and International Economic Policy Coordination \n     Act of 1988 (22 U.S.C. 5304(b)), not to exceed $1,000,000 is \n     for the Secretary of the Treasury, in conjunction with the \n     President, to implement said subsection as it pertains to \n     Governments and trade violations involving currency \n     manipulation and other trade violations;''.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I rise to thank both our distinguished \nchairman of this subcommittee, Senator Bond, and distinguished ranking \nmember, Senator Murray, for their leadership on this important bill and \nfor their words of support for my amendment.\n  This amendment addresses the need to make sure that we are enforcing \nour trade laws so that we have a level playing field for businesses and \nworkers in America with all of our trading partners. It designates and \nauthorizes a specific amount of money that would allow us to do that.\n  In my home State of Michigan, this is absolutely critical for us \nright now, as we see all of the challenges in the international \nmarketplace. We need to make sure that we are giving every business, \nevery worker, a level playing field, and we are doing everything we can \nto enforce our trade laws so that we have the opportunity to be \nexporting our products and not our jobs.\n  That should be the goal of all of us. I appreciate the fact that \nthere is a willingness to support my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Michigan. We \nworked with her on her original amendment. I think this amendment is \nnow a good amendment. Obviously, the objective is one that we all \nshare, and I believe with this modification, the concept that my \ncolleague has put forth is a good one. We are willing to accept it on \nthis side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, this amendment is acceptable on our \nside as well. We are ready to go forward at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2149.\n  The amendment (No. 2149) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, if there is not someone else wishing \nto speak, I will expand on what is happening as it relates to Michigan \nnow and why this is so important as an amendment.\n  I thank colleagues for working with us and helping us to modify the \namendment and to accept it today.\n  What is important for all of us, but particularly in Michigan now, as \nwe are the heart and soul of manufacturing, is, as we see our \nPresident, our\n\n[[Page S11604]]\n\nSecretary of Treasury, moving forward in discussions with China and \nJapan--the President is going next month to China and Japan--that we \nsend with him the strongest possible support, which this amendment \ndoes, for us saying we need to enforce all of our trade laws. We need \nto make sure we are leveling the playing field, and we are giving every \npossible fair advantage to American workers and to businesses.\n  Unfortunately, we have our trading partners--some of our trading \npartners right now--who are, in fact, violating our trade laws which is \ncosting us jobs at home, especially in the great State of Michigan. \nThis amendment will send a very important message that we want things \nlike illegal trade practices regarding currency manipulation to stop.\n  The President's upcoming trip is a very important time. Currently, \nChinese and Japanese trade policies are costing us jobs, including our \nmiddle-class families, because of the fact that they peg their currency \nin a way that means it costs us more to sell to them than it costs them \nto sell to us. In my State, I have heard from so many businesses saying \nthat the cost differential has made a huge difference in their being \nable to successfully compete on bids for contracts or to sell their \nproducts. We know that has been happening, and we need to stop it. We \nneed to enforce our trade laws.\n  We also need to crack down on the counterfeiting of American \nmanufactured goods. We need to stop the pirating of intellectual \nproperty. We have the great brainpower. We are developing all the new \nideas and the new patents. It is not right--in fact, it is illegal--for \nother countries to be able to take that information and make products \nthat compete and undercut us and cost us jobs.\n  Last week, Delphi, which is our Nation's largest autoparts supplier, \ndeclared bankruptcy, threatening 15,000 jobs in Michigan and more than \n33,000 across the country. In terms of assets, this bankruptcy is the \nlargest ever in the United States, surpassing the reorganizations of \nKmart and WorldCom. The Delphi bankruptcy should serve as a wake-up \ncall to all of us in the Congress, in the administration, and in the \ncountry, to the fact that we can no longer tolerate unfair trade \npractices and that we need to tackle the cost of health care and what \nis happening on pensions and make sure our workers do not lose their \npensions in the process of all of this happening.\n  Unless we put a stop to the unfair trade practices, our economy will \ncontinue to spiral downward, and I believe we are in jeopardy of losing \nour way of life. I don't say that lightly. I don't say that to be \nmelodramatic. But when we have people working at Delphi being told that \nnow in order to compete internationally, they have to take possibly a \n63-percent pay cut--that has been in the news, possibly a 63-percent \npay cut--we are not talking about just cutting back on wages. We are \ntalking about changing one's entire way of life. In the great State of \nMichigan we make things and we grow things, and we do it very well. We \nhave been at the forefront of the economic engine of our country, just \nas all manufacturing has been. But if we are going to say it is \nacceptable now for people to make $10 an hour and that somehow we can't \nhelp it, we are going to lose manufacturing in this country, and we are \nnot looking at what we can do to save our way of life.\n  We have to say that every trade agreement is one that creates a race \nup, not a race down, and that we are going to enforce every trade \nagreement. We are going to make sure other countries are not stealing \nour patents, are not creating counterfeit parts, are not manipulating \ntheir currency or doing other things that cause us to have a \ndisadvantage in the marketplace and to lose jobs.\n  I believe so strongly about what needs to happen as it relates to \nmanufacturers. I have concerns when I hear comments such as: We are not \ngoing to be able to manufacture anymore. We will have to do something \nelse.\n  An economy has to be based on making things, creating things, not \njust a service economy. We have to have a foundation based on \nmanufacturing. Has manufacturing changed? Of course, it has. I invite \nany colleague to come join me on any plant floor, and they will see \nsomething that is clean and quiet and computerized, with highly skilled \nworkers. Of course, it has changed. Of course, it is high tech. But it \nis still there, and it needs to be there. If we are not serious about \nenforcing our trade laws, creating the right kind of trade laws, we are \ngoing to lose it and our way of life. That is not acceptable. That is \nwhy there is nothing more important to me than fighting for our jobs \nand our manufacturers and making sure that we maintain the high \nstandard of living that has created this great country. That is what \nthis is all about.\n  Let me mention one area that is so important to Delphi. That is the \narea of counterfeit autoparts. We know that right now, according to our \nauto suppliers nationally, we are losing $12 billion every year to \ncounterfeit autoparts. That equates to about 200,000 jobs. We need to \nsay in the strongest possible terms that we expect that to stop. It is \na jobs issue. It is a safety issue. It needs to stop. We can do that. \nWe are not in a weak or hopeless situation. We have the ability to \nstand up, to say to our trading partners: It is not acceptable. We will \nuse every tool possible to stop counterfeit autoparts. We will use \nevery tool possible to stop currency manipulation, to stop the stealing \nof our patents.\n  That is what my amendment addresses, sending that word and--not just \na word--creating an action. We are beyond just talk. We have to have \naction because every day we do not have action, the great people in my \nState are under the threat of losing their jobs, their pension, and \ntheir way of life.\n  I thank my colleagues again for supporting this amendment. We are at \na place in time, in the history of the country where we have to take \nvery seriously what is happening to our great industries that have \ncreated the ability for folks to have a good standard of living, to \nhave the home and the car, in my great State the cottage up north, the \nboat, to send the kids to college, and pay into a pension all their \nlife and know it is going to be there.\n  That is what is threatened today in our country by policies that \ndon't get it. We have to have trade policies that work for American \njobs and American workers. We have to have enforcement of those trade \npolicies. We have to tackle the cost of health care and change the way \nwe do it to get it off the backs of our businesses. And we have to make \nsure that people who have worked all their lives and pay into a pension \nwill be able to have that when they retire.\n  I thank my colleagues, again, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                        Global War on Terrorism\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I will take a few minutes to talk about \nsome events that are extremely important--not on this bill--but I think \nit is important to follow up some excellent remarks made by my \ncolleagues from Colorado and South Carolina yesterday--I have a great \nprofessional and personal interest in it--and that is to recognize a \nmilestone in a very significant event in the global war on terror, the \nwar against Islamofascism.\n  This is extremely significant, and yet I do not believe the media has \ngiven it the attention it deserves. The milestone is an achievement \nthat the world would not have thought possible 2 years ago, and it \noccurred this past Saturday, on October 15, as the people of a free \nIraq voted in a national referendum on their national constitution.\n  This is a significant milestone no matter the outcome of the vote, \nthe people of a free Iraq have voted on a framework of a nation. That \nis a significant milestone against tyranny in our time.\n  It is my hope that the constitution will pass, and years from now the \npeople of Iraq and their children and grandchildren will know that this \nwas a time when the nation was founded in freedom, similar to our \nforefathers, who were children in 1776, told their children and \ngrandchildren after them.\n  The vote on the referendum occurred with surprisingly little \nviolence. It drew an encouraging voter turnout. This proves that the \nIraqi people and U.S. forces continue to make great strides toward \npeace and toward defeating both terrorists and insurgents in Iraq. I \nsay terrorists and insurgents because both are active in Iraq, and\n\n[[Page S11605]]\n\nthey are distinct groups. While there remains some Sunni Baathists who \nwould like to bring back Saddam and who could generally be called \ninsurgents, there is an ever-growing number of terrorists flooding into \nIraq to fight what they see as the ultimate jihad, legitimated by their \nextremist interpretation of Islam. Iraq has become their Armageddon, as \nwill become evident from my remarks in a few moments, and they are \nsimply terrorists.\n  With regard to the referendum, I commend U.S. Ambassador Khalilzad \nfor his tenacity and efforts in the constitutional process in his final \ndays leading up to the referendum that enabled Sunni, Shi'a, and Kurds \nto come together for a vote. Early reporting indicates the constitution \nwill pass, but we have to wait until all the votes are counted to make \nthe final call. I believe the constitution's passage will deal a heavy \nblow to the Sunni Baathist insurgents who are waging an ``all or \nnothing'' fight to regain control of Iraq. It now seems more clear than \never that the insurgents have to join in the political process if they \nare going to have any hope of a future in mainstream Iraqi civil and \npolitical society.\n  While I am pleased to see some moderate Sunni elements joining the \npolitical process, we must be watchful of violent groups that may try \nto expand their sphere of influence by establishing political platforms \nin order to legitimize their sinister ideologies. We have seen this \nhappen before in other areas of the world, such as Sinn Fein in the \nIrish Republican Army. As the saying goes: Fool me once, shame on you; \nfool me twice, shame on me.\n  Let us not be shamed by militants who momentarily trade in black \nhandkerchiefs that hide their faces for fine suits simply to gain a \nstake in the political power of their nation.\n  Critics of this administration, along with other naysayers, are \nconvinced that several of the constitution's provisions are politically \ndivisive because they grant the Kurds and Shi'a unfair advantages over \nthe Sunnis regarding Iraq's oil and other resources. I note that our \nvery own United States operated under the Articles of Confederation for \nabout 7 years, until we were able to draft and ratify a constitution, \nand that Constitution has been modified, and significantly so, over the \nyears.\n  We are often too impatient in our fast-paced, modern world, but let \nus not forget that democracy takes time and requires patient, \ndeliberate action. Until Iraq's liberation in April 2003, Iraq suffered \nunder a ruthless dictator whose kleptocratic regime offered its people \nlittle more than fear and terror. Now, for the first time in over 30 \nyears, we can say that the Iraqi people are courageously embarking on \ntheir own journey toward political self-determination and individual \nfreedom, and for that I applaud them and am greatly satisfied.\n  On Tuesday of this week, the Wall Street Journal had an op-ed piece \nby Michael Rubin of the American Enterprise Institute. It is titled, \n``With Freedom Comes Politics.''\n\n       Iraqis now see the fruit of foreign investment. A year ago \n     in Baghdad, Iraqis drank water and soft drinks imported from \n     neighboring countries. Now they drink water bottled in plants \n     scattered across Iraq. . . .\n       Cameras and reporters do not lie, but they do not always \n     give a full perspective. Political brinkmanship devoid of \n     context breeds panic. Beheadings and blood sell copy, but do \n     not accurately reflect Iraq. Political milestones give a \n     glimpse of the often-unreported determination that Iraqis \n     and longtime visitors see daily. Bombings and body bags \n     are tragic. But they do not reflect failure. Rather, they \n     represent the sacrifice that both Iraqis and Americans \n     have made for security and democracy. The referendum, \n     refugee return, real estate and investment show much more \n     accurately--and objectively--Iraq's slow and steady \n     progress.\n\n  Madam President, I will insert that article in the Record because \nthat exactly reflects the views of the young men and women I know who \nare serving in Iraq. They see our national television too often focuses \non ``if it bleeds, it leads.'' If there is a tragic loss of an American \nlife, that is the only headline, nothing about the progress. But there \nis progress being made, and this election showed it.\n  My satisfaction with the progress in Iraq is not without reservation. \nI bring to my colleagues' attention a significant event with positive \nand negative implications. This is the intercept of a letter written on \nJuly 9 by Osama bin Laden's principal deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, to al-\nQaida's foremost lieutenant on the ground in Iraq, Abu Mus'ab al-\nZarqawi. The letter was obtained by U.S. forces in a raid in Iraq this \nsummer but only released by the Government on October 11 in order to \navoid the compromise of ongoing operations.\n  The letter provides a broad look at al-Qaida's global strategy and \nplans for operation Iraq. The letter underscores that al-Qaida will not \nrelent in pursuing its Sunni extremist agenda and reveals that al-Qaida \nviews its jihad in Iraq as the focal point in its efforts to create an \nextremist global ``caliphate.''\n  President Bush has rightly called this Islamofascism. This is a war \nthat will go on even after Iraq is stable.\n  Zawahiri writes to Zarqawi:\n\n       God has blessed you and your brothers, while many of the \n     Muslim mujahedin have longed for that blessing . . . and that \n     (blessing) is Jihad in the heart of the Islamic world . . . \n     he has blessed you with the splendor of the spearhead of \n     Jihad.\n\n  Zawahiri's recipe for creating this Sunni extremist state is in this \norder: evict the Americans from Iraq, create an Islamic extremist state \nin Iraq, swallow up Iraq's neighbors, and then destroy Israel. It goes \non and on from there.\n  The letter reads like a Sunni extremist epistle written by a father \nfigure to a young leader among the faithful. Zawahiri applauds \nZarqawi's enthusiasm and acts of terror that have advanced their jihad. \nYet he cautions Zarqawi to remember the power of world opinion and the \nsubtleties of political influence and media persuasion. Similar to an \nexpert teacher, Zawahiri commends Zarqawi for his enthusiasm and past \ndeeds. Yet he gently persuades him to alter his tactics toward a better \nway.\n  Zawahiri asserts in his letter that while Zarqawi's violent tactics \nare justified, they do not play well in the media. And while he doesn't \nobject to beheadings on any moral grounds, he notes ``a bullet to the \nhead'' is more efficient and doesn't invite such negative press. He \nreferences Algerian brethren who are with him who worry that the war in \nIraq could go the way of the Algerian jihad in the late nineties when \nthe radicals lost their support among the general Muslim population due \nto their brutal acts of torture.\n  In addition, although Zawahiri describes the Shi'a as ``cooperating \nwith the enemies of Islam,'' he criticizes Zarqawi for attacking the \nIraqi Shi'a in ways that will hurt al-Qaida in the media, and he \nrecommends Zarqawi avoid opening too many fronts in the jihad.\n  He also stresses that political warfare is needed in order to draw in \nthe social elites to support their push for an Islamic extremist state.\n  In effect, Zawahiri recommends that the wolf put on sheep's clothing \nin order to mask the wolf's true brutality. To me this is troubling \nbecause it illustrates that we are at war with an enemy who is astute, \ndeceptive, and wise in the ways of the world and the American media and \nits ability to influence American public opinion. It underscores that \nthis enemy cannot be negotiated with and will never reform its way or \nbe deterred from its path of violence. The only option we have with \nsuch an enemy, according to what we have seen, who want to slaughter \nAmerican women, men, and children, is to eliminate it. There is no \nother choice. That is why we must flush the terrorists out and hunt \nthem down.\n  There are some notable positives in Zawahiri's letter. The letter \ndemonstrates that America's efforts in the war on terrorism have been \neffective in hurting al-Qaida and in disrupting its ability to attack \nthe United States and its interests. Zawahiri's statements reveal that \ndue to the pressure he feels in areas around him, he cannot depart his \nremote location, a location so remote that he complains of a lack of \naccess to contemporary news reporting on Iraq. He also reveals that he \nis running out of funds and asked Zarqawi for $100,000 in order to open \nup new communications lines that have been shut down due to the \napprehension of al-Qaida operatives this past summer.\n  Finally, he also expresses concern over Pakistani military operations \nin the tribal area and references the current Pakistani Army offensive \nin northern Waziristan.\n  Well, Allah be praised. We are at a crossroads in the war on terror \nbecause\n\n[[Page S11606]]\n\nwe are at the point where our enemy believes we are about to tuck tail \nand run in Iraq. But we must press on. Al-Qaida is convinced that \nAmerica will abandon Iraq. Zawahiri writes that al-Qaida must begin \npreparing now for what he likens to ``the collapse of American power in \nVietnam--they ran and left their agents.''\n  Running is no option. We must fight on. So I ask today that we \ncontinue our support for our troops who are in harm's way, for the \nintelligence officials and aid workers deployed throughout the globe in \nthe frontlines on the war on terror, and I ask that we forget not that \nour struggle is a fight to the death, for that is how our enemy sees \nit. And with every suicide bomber who takes more innocent life \nprovides, they prove to us that they are prepared to die. May we \nrecommit ourselves to this fight to show the world that we are prepared \nto fight so that we, our allies, and peace-loving peoples of the world \nmay live.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the article I \nreferenced called ``With Freedom Comes Politics'' be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      With Freedom Comes Politics\n\n                           (By Michael Rubin)\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 18, 2005.]\n\n       On Oct. 15, Iraqis demonstrated that their desire to \n     determine the future through the ballot box was the rule \n     rather than the exception. Arabs, Kurds and Turkmen; Sunnis, \n     Shiites and Christians--all braved threats of violence to \n     vote. The vast majority voted in favor of the constitution. \n     But whatever their positions, Iraqis considered their \n     decision carefully. The referendum campaign was active. \n     Dueling commercials and newscasts sought to sway the Iraqi \n     vote. Such is the nature of politics in a country no longer \n     subject to state-controlled media.\n       Some read the constitution. They voted for or against \n     federalism. Some marked their ballot on the basis of how \n     closely they wished religion to be mixed with government. \n     Others did not read the document but learned about it on \n     television, in newspapers and even by text messaging, the \n     latest medium employed by Iraqi politicians to reach \n     constituents. Security, rather than content, was a \n     determinant for some. They voted ``yes'' to avoid the chaos \n     of failure and the prolongation of occupation.\n       The referendum capped a constitutional drafting process \n     over which Western commentators and diplomats had been quick \n     to panic. They misunderstand that with freedom comes \n     politics. The same U.S. senators who debated the ``nuclear \n     option'' for judicial nominees failed to recognize political \n     brinkmanship among their Iraqi counterparts.\n       Many U.S. policy makers worry that disgruntled Sunnis may \n     turn to violence if their demands aren't met. But there is no \n     evidence to support the conventional wisdom that insurgent \n     violence is tied to the political process. Insurgents have \n     not put forward any platform. By denying the legitimacy of \n     the state, pan-Islamic rhetoric is a greater affront to Iraqi \n     nationalism than the presence of foreign troops on Iraqi \n     soil. It is no accident that Iraqi Sunnis have started \n     killing foreign jihadists.\n       Nevertheless, implying violence to be the result of demands \n     not met is an old Middle East game. And in this game, Iraqi \n     factions have played the Western media and policy makers like \n     a fiddle. White House pressure, for example, led U.S. \n     officials to amend the political process in order to augment \n     the Sunni presence in the Constitutional Drafting Commission. \n     Acceding to such demands is not without cost. Because Iraq's \n     Sunni leaders are more Islamist than their Shiite \n     counterparts, the increased Sunni presence eroded the rights \n     of Iraqi women in the constitution's final draft.\n       Some critics still maintain that the ``yes'' vote may \n     exacerbate conflict. What is needed is consensus, they say. \n     On Sept. 26, for example, the International Crisis Group \n     released a statement criticizing ``a rushed constitutional \n     process [that] has deepened rifts and hardened feelings. \n     Without a strong U.S.-led initiative to assuage Sunni Arab \n     concerns, the constitution is likely to fuel rather than \n     dampen the insurgency.'' This NGO bemoaned the referendum as \n     little more than an opportunity for Iraqis ``to embrace a \n     weak document that lacks consensus.''\n       But consensus is not always possible. Though Sunnis are \n     perhaps 15% of Iraq's population, they believe themselves to \n     be 50%. Any agreement acceding to their inflated sense of \n     power would automatically disenfranchise the remainder of the \n     population. With the collapse of apartheid in 1994, white \n     South Africans had to confront their minority status. Iraqi \n     Sunnis must face the same reality. The process may be \n     painful, but justice, democracy and long-term stability \n     demand it continue.\n       Even without consensus, the constitution represents the \n     type of social and political compromise lacking through the \n     Arab world. Members of the Constitutional Drafting Commission \n     and Iraqi power brokers spent months debating and canvassing \n     constituents. Any politician living outside the U.S.-\n     controlled Green Zone--Jalal Talabani, Abdul Aziz Hakim and \n     Ahmad Chalabi, for example--had his parlor filled with Iraqis \n     from different cities and of various ethnic and sectarian \n     backgrounds until the early hours of morning. These Iraqi \n     petitioners voiced interests and demands diametrically \n     opposed to each other. Consensus was not always possible, but \n     compromise was. As with the constitution, the nature of \n     compromise is a result ideal to none but fair to all.\n       The referendum result again demonstrates that American \n     policy- and opinion-makers are more pessimistic than are \n     Iraqis. Part of the problem is that Pentagon officials and \n     journalists alike chart Iraq's success through misguided \n     metrics. Counting car bombs does not demonstrate progress or \n     lack thereof in Iraq. Objective indicators show that Iraqis \n     have confidence that did not exist prior to liberation.\n       According to an Aug. 16, 2002, commentary in the Guardian--\n     a British newspaper that often opposes U.S. foreign policy--\n     one in six Iraqis had fled their country under Saddam. \n     Millions left because of war, dictatorship and sanctions. \n     Today, several hundred thousand have returned; only the \n     Christians still leave. If Iraq were as chaotic as the media \n     implies, it would export refugees, not resettle them.\n       Other indicators suggest Iraqis have confidence in their \n     future. The Iraqi dinar, freely traded in international \n     currency markets, is stable.\n       When people fear for their future, they invest in gold; \n     jewelry and coins can be sewn into clothes and smuggled out \n     of the country. When people feel confident about the future, \n     they buy real estate. Property prices have skyrocketed across \n     Iraq. Decrepit houses in Sadr City, a Shiite slum on the \n     outskirts of Baghdad, can easily cost $45,000. Houses in \n     upper-middle-class districts of Mansour and Karrada can cost \n     more than 20 times that. Restaurant owners spend $50,000 on \n     top-of-the-line generators to keep open despite the frequent \n     blackouts. In September 2005, there were 40 buildings nine \n     stories or higher under construction in the Kurdish city of \n     Sulaymani. Five years ago, there were none. Iraqis would not \n     spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on real estate if they \n     weren't confident that the law would protect their \n     investment.\n       Iraqis now see the fruit of foreign investment. A year ago \n     in Baghdad, Iraqis drank water and soft drinks imported from \n     neighboring countries. Now they drink water bottled in plants \n     scattered across Iraq. When I visited a Baghdad computer shop \n     last spring, my hosts handed me a can of Pepsi. An Arabic \n     banner across the can announced, ``The only soft drink \n     manufactured in Iraq.'' In August, a Coca-Cola executive in \n     Istanbul told me their Baghdad operation is not far behind. \n     Turkish investors in partnership with local Iraqis have built \n     modern hotels in Basra.\n       Cameras and reporters do not lie, but they do not always \n     give a full perspective. Political brinkmanship devoid of \n     context breeds panic. Beheadings and blood sell copy, but do \n     not accurately reflect Iraq. Political milestones give a \n     glimpse of the often-unreported determination that Iraqis and \n     longtime visitors see daily. Bombings and body bags are \n     tragic. But they do not reflect failure. Rather, they \n     represent the sacrifice that both Iraqis and Americans have \n     made for security and democracy. The referendum, refugee \n     return, real estate and investment show much more \n     accurately--and objectively--Iraq's slow but steady progress.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. I would like recognition to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. First of all, let me align my words with the words from \nthe Senator from Missouri on the war on terror. He is absolutely right. \nThis is a war for our survival. It is focused in three or four areas in \nthe world today, but if we don't win, it will be in many more areas \nthroughout the rest of the world.\n  The sacrifices are great for our men and women who are serving our \ncountry and those in ancillary roles, but that is what our country has \nbeen made of--of sacrifice to preserve freedom.\n  I wish to speak first before I offer some amendments to this bill \nabout something that has been troubling me and the people from Oklahoma \nand many of the people across this country for a long time. The \nquestion is, Why should we be troubled? Because all change starts with \na distant rumble, a rumble at the grassroots level, and if you stop and \nlisten today, you will hear such a rumble right now. That rumble is the \nsound of hard-working\n\n[[Page S11607]]\n\nAmericans who are getting increasingly angry with out-of-control \nGovernment spending, waste, fraud, and abuse. It is the sound of \ngrowing disillusionment and frustration of the American people. It is \nthe sense of increasing disgust about blatant overspending and our \nability to make the tough choices people on budgets have to make each \nand every day, our inability to make priorities the No. 1 priority \nrather than spending our children and grandchildren's future. That is a \nrumble of frustration that is getting louder. In fact, I hear it right \nnow. That is because I am listening for it. We should all listen for \nit. If we don't, the voters will decide the changes that will come. And \nI can't say that I blame them.\n  Politicians have been trying to buy reelection by sanctioning more \nand more spending for years. Since 2000, discretionary spending in this \ncountry outside of defense and outside of homeland security has grown \nby 33 percent, and that does not include any of the $400 billion in \nemergency designations that have been passed by the Congress and signed \nby this President. We have the very great prospect that the spending \nover the last 5 years and the next 3 years will be the greatest growth \nin Federal spending ever in our history in terms of percentage increase \nand speed and velocity of spending increases. And we will have made it \npossible when we should have been fighting it every step of the way.\n  I am not here to remind us about the Alaska bridge to nowhere, \nalthough I will have an amendment on that later, or the countless \nearmarks and pork projects that sail through this Chamber every year. \nEverybody knows about that. Many of them are great projects, they are \nneeded, they are necessary. They just may not be in the best priority \nfor our Nation at this time.\n  That is what I am hearing. What I am here to tell you is that the \nrumble against spending is getting louder. People are fed up. All \nacross the country, Americans are rising up against Government \noverspending. They are tired of hearing about perpetual budget crises \nwhen tax revenues keep rising faster and faster. They are tired of the \ndishonesty of the budget process where we say we have a $320 billion \ndeficit, and yet the debt to our children and grandchildren rises by \n$600 billion because everything is done in an emergency and does not \nfollow the appropriations and budget process.\n  They know that for every dollar of increasing tax revenues, we have, \nboth Republicans and Democrats, found a way to spend another $1.25. \nThat is the crisis. It is a spending crisis. It is a lack of oversight \ncrisis. It is a crisis of our will. Do we have the willpower to stop \noverspending, to make the hard choices about priorities that the \nAmerican people expect of us? If we don't, the people certainly do. \nThat is why there is a rumble building across this country. The people \nare tired of waiting for us to do the right thing. They know it will \nnot happen, so they are working at the grassroots level to get the job \ndone themselves.\n  People are working to change the rules in States all across this \ncountry. A group called Americans for Limited Government is one of the \ngroups leading that charge. In my home State, they are working with the \nlocal group called Oklahomans in Action to put the stop overspending \ninitiative on the ballot. There are similar efforts in the works in \nNebraska, Nevada, Maine, Michigan, and dozens of other States. And \ncommittees full of outraged citizens are forming as we speak because of \nour inability to control the ever-growing appetite of the Federal \nGovernment and the State governments. The stop overspending initiative \nis simple but powerful. It puts a cap on how fast governments can grow. \nIt holds the elected representatives accountable to the same budgeting \nstandards that work in the real world, the standards that families, \nbusinesses, and individuals have to live by every day. And most \nimportantly, the stop overspending initiative is a tool for American \ncitizens to regain control of their State governments. I personally \napplaud this initiative.\n  In the coming year, millions of people in a dozen States will be \nusing these initiatives to change the rules of their State government \nand to show their State representatives and State senators and assembly \nmen and women who is really in charge. These groups are getting an \nincredible response, and the reason why is simple: The American people \nare absolutely furious at the waste, fraud, abuse, and out-of-control \nspending they see every day, not just here in Washington but in their \nown State government.\n  We need to wake up. I say let us change first. Let us find our will. \nNo more low-priority projects in the face of half-trillion-dollar \ndeficits, no more exorbitant bridges to nowhere. Speaking of bridges, \nthat is where this Congress will be, on a bridge to nowhere if we do \nnot gain control of ourselves. And if the voters finally rise up and \nreject us as the Congress that spends too much, we will have gotten \nwhat we deserve. You don't need to take my word for it. Just take a \nminute and listen to the voices of the people we represent. They are \nready to rumble. They are getting louder. Are we listening?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2084\n\n  (Purpose: To require that any limitation, directive, or earmarking \n   contained in either the House of Representatives or Senate report \n accompanying this bill be included in the conference report or joint \n  statement accompanying the bill in order to be considered as having \n               been approved by both Houses of Congress)\n\n  Madam President, I call up amendment No. 2084.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2084.\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. Any limitation, directive, or earmarking contained \n     in either the House of Representatives or Senate report \n     accompanying H.R. 3058 shall also be included in the \n     conference report or joint statement accompanying H.R. 3058 \n     in order to be considered as having been approved by both \n     Houses of Congress.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, this amendment has been voted on twice \nin the Senate. It has been accepted by two other subcommittee chairmen. \nIt is a very simple amendment that the American people want. It says we \nought to know what we are voting on. When a bill comes from the House, \nit has certain earmarks and special things in it. The Senate produces a \nbill based on that bill that goes to conference, and earmarks and \nadditional things are placed in that bill as well as the House original \nearmarks.\n  It comes back out in a conference report for us to vote on, but there \nis no clarity to list in that conference report where the earmarks, the \nactual items that have been directed by Members of Congress, are \ngoing.They are in there. Can you dig them out? It takes about 4 days to \ndig them out.\n  This is a very simple amendment. All it says is we ought to know what \nwe are voting on. It is not to say the earmarks are bad or good, it is \nto say they ought to be out there so we can discuss them. If somebody \nhas an earmark, that Senator ought to be proud enough to stand up and \ndefend it if there is criticism of it. It is about good government, \nabout shining a light on government so we know in fact what we are \nvoting on when we vote on a conference report on an appropriations \nbill.\n  I have been told by the chairman that this is probably acceptable. I \nawait his response. At the last vote on this amendment it passed by 55 \nto 39 on the Agriculture appropriations bill. It was accepted by \nunanimous consent to the Military Construction bill, as well as the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill. This amendment has been \nendorsed by several outside groups, and it is included in ratings of \nCongress by the American Taxpayers Union.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, we would like to consider this amendment. \nI ask it be set aside until we see how the operations work with the \nrest of the amendments. This may be relevant to the others. I ask \nunanimous consent we set this amendment aside temporarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2087\n\n (Purpose: To limit the Department of Housing and Urban Development's \n                        funding for conferences)\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I call up amendment No. 2087 and ask the pending \namendment be set aside.\n\n[[Page S11608]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2087.\n\n       On page 348, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 321. LIMITATION ON FUNDING FOR CONFERENCES.\n\n       Of the funds made available for the Department of Housing \n     and Development under the heading ``Management and \n     Administration, Salaries and Expenses'' in this title, not to \n     exceed $3,000,000 shall be available for expenses related to \n     conferences, including for conference programs, staff time, \n     travel costs, and related expenses.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, this is a very simple amendment. In the \nhistory of HUD, in 2001 they spent $3 million on conferencing. Last \nyear they spent $13.9 million on conferences around the country.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a table showing \nthe dollar amounts spent on HUD conferences from 2002-2006.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                             Department of Housing\n\n\n                                        and Urban Development,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 29, 2005.\n     Hon.

I also note, with the advent of modern technology and \nvideo conferencing, 90 percent of these conferences could have occurred \nwithout travel costs, without hotel costs, without face-to-face \nmeetings. In fact, we didn't use the technology available. We spent \ntons of money traveling around the country holding conferences, not \nnecessarily that were bad in their content or their intent but which \nwere wasteful in the way they were arranged. Also, I suggest that a \n400-percent increase in conferences in one area, one agency of the \nFederal Government, shows that either they were doing a very poor job \nin 2001, or it is out of control.\n  This is a very simple, straightforward amendment. Before Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita struck, 737,000 Americans were identified as being \nhomeless as reported by HUD. Earlier this month, the Acting Director of \nFEMA told the Senate committee that between 400,000 and 600,000 \ndisplaced households in Louisiana and Mississippi alone will need long-\nterm housing.\n  With the problems before us today, certainly we can use the latest \ntechnology and trim back the excessive growth in conferencing that is \nused by the Housing and Urban Development Department.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, we share the concerns of the Senator from \nOklahoma. I think there are more efficient ways for HUD to conduct its \nconferences. Therefore, on our side we accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, we are able to accept this amendment on \nour side as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2087) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the ranking member, the Senator from Washington, \nfor that.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2091\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit any funds under the Act from being used for the \n Seattle Art Museum in Seattle, Washington for the construction of the \n                        Olympic Sculpture Park)\n\n  I have an amendment numbered 2091. I know this is important to the \nSenator from Washington. I call it up and ask unanimous consent to set \naside the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2091.\n       On page 348, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 321. SEATTLE ART MUSEUM.\n\n       None of the funds made available for the Department of \n     Housing and Urban Development under the heading ``Community \n     Development Fund'' in this title, shall be available for the \n     Seattle Art Museum in Seattle, Washington for the \n     construction of the Olympic Sculpture Park.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, in our country today we face the largest \nnatural disaster we have ever seen. We have already allocated $62 \nbillion for that--which we did not pay for. It is totally going to be \npaid for by our children and our grandchildren. We will not pay a penny \nof that.\n  We have a war going on for which we are going to have to provide \nadditional supplemental spending, of which we will pay for none in \nterms of the supplemental, which debt we will transfer to our children.\n  This is probably a very worthwhile project, but this is about \npriorities. I think it is probably a great project. In the State of \nWashington alone there are 17,590 homeless people, and we are going to \ntake money from Housing and Urban Development and we are going to build \na sculpture park. I think that is not the right priority. It may be a \ngood idea, but the priority is certainly out of line with what the \nfiscal needs are, and certainly out of line with the expectations of \nthe American people on how we are spending their money.\n  A little background: The Seattle Art Museum just received a $300,000 \ngrant from the Getty Museum in Los Angeles. It is a well-established \nmuseum, well-funded, with good assets. The question is not whether we \nshould be building a sculpture park. The question\n\n[[Page S11609]]\n\nis, Is the time to do it today? In a time of war, in a time of deep, \ntrue budget crisis, $600 billion--that is what our real increase in \nFederal debt was ending September 30. It increased $600 billion--should \nwe spend half a million dollars on a sculpture park? I think not. I \nthink most Americans would say not. I think some people who are very \nclosely aligned with this museum, the Seattle Art Museum, would agree \nwith that, but I think the vast number of Americans would say now is \nnot the time to do that.\n  I also remind our fellow Members that if you read the Constitution, \nthere are great difficulties--regardless of what our history has been--\njustifying, looking at the Constitution and saying this is a role for \nthe Federal Government. That rumble I spoke about--these are the types \nof things the American people see that we do not need to spend money \non, when we are asking them and their children and their grandchildren \nto have a lower standard of living in the future because we are not \nresponsible today.\n  It is probably a great project, but not now, not at this time, and \nnot with Federal money. When we have so many people hurting in \nMississippi, so many people hurting in Louisiana, so many people \nhurting in Alabama, we are going to take funds from them? That is where \nit is going to come from. It is going to come from them because we are \ngoing to spend more to pay for those problems that we are encountering \nin those three States from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and we are \ngoing to take it away and say we are going to charge it to our \ngrandchildren.\n  We have a credit card going right now. We need to stand up and say \ncertain things we cannot do right now. They are not bad ideas. It is \njust that now is not the time.\n  I ask unanimous consent this amendment be agreed to. If not, I ask \nfor a vote on this amendment at the proper time.\n  One other thing I would like to say. Seattle, WA, is ranked No. 2 in \nthe Nation for food insecurity. What is more important, feeding people \nand housing people, or building a sculpture park? It is hard to figure \nout how in the world we can say that is a more important priority and \ntake a half million dollars out of HUD and spend it on something that \nis such a low priority.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I see the Senator from Oklahoma has \nessentially proposed five amendments which all seek to do the same \nthing, amendments Nos. 2089, 2090, 2091, 2092, 2093. These essentially \nare targeted at economic development initiatives.\n  I wonder if we might have a full debate on all of them and combine \nthem into one amendment so we could spare our colleagues having to have \nrollcall votes on five? Through the Chair, I ask if the Senator from \nOklahoma would voluntarily agree to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri does have the floor \nat this time.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I will be happy to talk with the Senator \nlater about that. Let me continue with some of the comments that I have \nin general, that are applicable to all these amendments.\n  Within this budget, in our committee and other committees, we have \nidentified at the request of many Senators in the States, including the \nState of Oklahoma, including the States of Alaska, Washington, \nMissouri--priorities in the report to be eligible for funds under the \nEconomic Development Initiatives Account, subject to Department review. \nMy colleague, who is the author of this amendment, proposes that these \nare necessarily bad. I suspect, if we looked State by State, we would \nhave 100 different definitions of how precisely to prioritize these \ninitiatives.\n  The suggestion here is that Senators should not have any say in what \nis important in their States. My profession is serving the people of \nMissouri. I have been doing it for 27 years now. I do not have the \nskills or the expertise that the author of this amendment does. He, as \nI understand it, is a fine obstetrician. His commitment is to a high \nhumanitarian calling, serving people in the obstetrics field. Certainly \nthat is a fine profession.\n  I envy his ability to deliver assistance and deliver babies. We need \nprofessionals of this type. That is his profession. My profession is \nvery different. I don't have the skills of a physician or an engineer \nor a physical scientist. My job, my profession, is serving the people \nof Missouri. And as I have said, I do it proudly, this being my 27th \nyear, I believe. In that time, I have found that if you listen to the \npeople of Missouri you learn a lot. You learn about the needs of \nveterans. We have done things nationwide to serve veterans. I have been \nhonored to be recognized by the Veterans of Foreign Wars.\n  We have found out how important children's hospitals are, and we have \nworked to help children's hospitals. I am very grateful for the \nrecognition from children's hospitals, and from in-home health care, \nwhich is very important, and from early childhood education, for which \nmy initiatives have won national acclaim.\n  In addition to these matters that affect the entire Nation, I have \ncommitted myself to trying to build strong communities throughout \nMissouri.\n  I know the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma practices medicine, \nwhich is a wonderful practice, and does so with skill and provides a \ntremendous benefit. But do you know what I do when we have time off? I \ntravel around the State. I meet with community leaders, local elected \nofficials, concerned citizens, people who are trying to build a \nstronger community. Do they need a community health center? I have \nhelped them get community health centers. Do they need something to \nhelp create jobs? Do they have projects which are properly supported by \nFederal funds that we make available through the Economic Development \nInitiative? Yes, in many instances they are. Do they have projects \nwhich require ground transportation which are properly funded by the \nrail transportation funds we have in this bill? Do they need water and \nsewers? I have been through many small communities. I hate to tell you \nthat you can in the summer tell by the smell that they do not have an \neffective wastewater treatment system. They have waited in long lines \nfor public health treatment, and we have helped them get the water \ntreatment systems they need. This, I believe, is a legitimate function \nof the Federal Government--deciding where the highest priorities are.\n  When I am up here working, I have a dedicated staff back home who \nvisits every county in the State at least once, and many others several \ntimes a year. I visit every county in my State and every city in my \nState every term I serve in office. I hear from them--leaders in the \ncommunity, the people who are concerned about the particular problems \nand how best to solve those.\n  That is where I come back and say that from the EDI funds, from a \nportion roughly about 5 percent of the community development block \ngrants, we will designate some of these high-priority needs which must \nbe met for the good of the community and where we can help meet them \nthrough the addition of Federal funds targeted to those areas.\n  I believe it has been successful. The people of Missouri think it is \nsuccessful. I know the Senator from Washington does the same thing. The \nSenator from Washington listens to her people. She knows how to build a \nstrong community in the State of Washington. I believe that is her job. \nI wouldn't propose to go in and tell her what is a good use of the \nEconomic Development Initiative or community development block grants \nin Washington. She has to answer to the people of Washington. Far be it \nfor me to tell her what is good for the State of Washington.\n  When the Senator from Oklahoma asked me for something that is a high-\npriority project in his State, if it fits within the guidelines, I am \nhappy to help that Senator determine what is best in Oklahoma. But I \ndon't need a Senator from Oklahoma telling me what is good in Missouri \nor telling the Senator from Washington what is good for the State of \nWashington. We believe our job is to serve and represent and listen to \nthe people of our States. I believe a vast majority of the Senators in \nthis body know their job is to\n\n[[Page S11610]]\n\nserve their States, whether it is a vote on national legislation, \nwhether it is a vote on something that is very important to their \npeople, whether it is national, or whether it has to do with a specific \nactivity within their State that they want to support. I think that is \nour job. That is our profession. We stand for reelection based on how \nwell we serve our people. I am grateful for the tremendous honor and \nprivilege I have been given by the people of Missouri. They know I am \nnot a physician; they know I am not a physical scientist, but they know \nI am here to serve and represent them.\n  The suggestion appears to be that none of us as Members, those of us \nwho work through our State and who listen to the people of our State, \nshould have any say in what their priorities are. That suggests that \nthe Senators are not in touch with the priorities of their own State. I \ndon't believe that is true generally. I know it is not true in \nMissouri. I believe it is not true in Washington. My colleague can \nspeak to that.\n  It might be that some Senators are too busy to understand or consult \nwith their communities. But I understand what my State's needs are. I \naggressively consult with leaders in my State. It might be some \nSenators believe that maybe the bureaucrats at the agencies understand \ntheir States better than the Senators themselves. I do not believe that \nshould be the case because I spend more time in the State than I do \nhere. I travel as many miles as I can squeeze into a schedule.\n  The amendments from the Senator from Oklahoma don't save money. They \njust say that a Senator shall not be able to determine what is a \npriority need in his or her State. Do you know something? I happen to \nthink a Senator who is doing his or her job probably has as good an \nidea and should have a better idea of what is an important priority \nthan some bureaucrat in HUD who will otherwise be spending that money.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BOND. I will finish shortly and then I will be happy to answer \nquestions.\n  Again, I am not afraid to say that I know more about the needs of my \nState than the ``U.S. Department of Anything.'' I will be happy to be \njudged on that.\n  I know we ought to be reducing budget spending. According to the \nBudget Committee, we have defeated attempts to waive the Budget Act and \nhave achieved reductions and savings of some $170 billion this year \nalone. I have provided recommendations to our Budget chairman for \nmaking significant reductions. We are waiting for the leadership and \nthe reconciliation bill to decide how we save money.\n  But this amendment and the others like it makes excellent headlines \nand they will be welcomed by some newspaper editorials, some talk radio \nshow hosts, but it would be a better headline if the Senator were \nactually attacking a project in his State. If he thinks that \nappropriations for museums is so bad, what about the money in there for \nthe Ponca City Indian Museum? Does he feel that is an appropriate \npriority for the State of Oklahoma? He can answer that. I think that \nwould make an even better headline.\n\n  But I am not interested in getting headlines for something that \ndoesn't save money in the budget. I am more interested in what people \nsay, what the Cape Giradeaux Southeast Missourian or the Joplin Globe \nor the St. Joe News Press say about what the needs are in their State--\nnot what somebody in New York or in California says about the projects. \nI know my colleague from Washington surely will have something to say \nabout that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask the Senator from Missouri a couple \nof questions.\n  Has he or any of his staff ever received requests from me for any \nearmark or any project whatsoever?\n  Mr. BOND. No.\n  Mr. COBURN. Has any other appropriations chairman ever received an \nappropriations request or earmark from me from any other area?\n  Mr. BOND. I have no knowledge.\n  Mr. COBURN. The answer to that is no.\n  The Senator said earlier to me privately that this is a battle about \nphilosophy. I agree; it is. The oath we take has no mention of our \nState. The oath we take is to defend the Constitution and do what is in \nthe best interests of the country as a whole. It is a philosophical \ndifference.\n  I am somewhat hurt by the inference that I don't listen and I don't \ntravel. I traveled 4,500 miles, I have done 67 townhall meetings, and \nthe biggest criticism anybody ever has of me is that I work too much--\nnot too little. I listen to the people of Oklahoma. The campaign \npromise I made to the people of Oklahoma who sent me here by a 12-point \nadvantage was that I will bring nothing home to Oklahoma until the \nbudget is balanced. That is the philosophy the American people are \nlooking for. There is no priority if we continue to steal the future of \nour children.\n  I had no idea the Ponca City Indian Museum was in there. You will get \nan amendment quickly to get that out. I had no knowledge it was there. \nMy senior Senator must have put that in there. I have no problems with \nthe same standard being applied to Oklahoma as it is to everyone else.\n  This isn't a water treatment program. This is a sculpture park. All I \nam saying is it may be a good idea. There are hundreds of other things \nI would love to take the time to discuss on the Senate floor--and I \nwill if you all insist on having a debate about every earmark in the \nappropriations bill. I will be happy to afford the Senator that \ncourtesy, and we will spend a lot more time on appropriations bills. \nBut what we need to talk about is the priorities in this country of how \nwe get out of the financial mess we are in.\n  Mr. BOND. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COBURN. I will be happy to yield in a moment.\n  I understand the importance of Senators directing the bureaucracy. \nThe problem is the bureaucracy is too big. Instead of us doing the \noversight we need to be doing to control the bureaucracy so they have a \npriority, we supersede it because we don't want to do the hard work of \noversight, of holding them accountable. We need to be doing oversight. \nWe need to be looking at every individual.\n  I will match my service as Senator, both for my constituency and my \nservice in terms of my field representatives and the work they do. I \nwill match my service in terms of traveling and listening in Oklahoma. \nI have been in every area of Oklahoma the first 9 months of this year--\nevery area. I have missed four counties.\n  The implication that I don't listen, the implication that I don't \nwork in my Senate position I take offense to. I will tell that to the \nSenator from Missouri. Nobody will outwork me in my job; nobody. I will \ndo what is necessary to do what I believe the people of Oklahoma sent \nme here to do, which is to help turn around the ship that is going to \ndrown our grandchildren financially.\n  We can try to relate the sculpture park to a water treatment plant, \nbut everybody in the country knows there is no connection between those \ntwo. There are necessities of life, there are priorities, and actually \nthe debate is about priorities. It is not about whether a Senator \nshould be directing things. I haven't said don't direct anything. I \nsaid there are earmarks that should not be in this bill because they \nare not proper at a time when we have such financial difficulties. If \nwe were in surplus, I wouldn't be here mentioning even one of these \nprojects, not one. But we are not in surplus.\n  We can deny the fact that the true add to the debt was $.6 trillion--\n$600 billion. That is $2,000 per man, woman, and child this year that \nwe added to their debt; $2,000 for every little baby I might deliver, \nor every grandmother I might care for.\n  To correct the Senator, I am an obstetrician but I am also an old-\ntime GP. I care for Medicare, I care for little kids, I care for old \npeople, nursing home people, and I listen. I tell you that when I \npractice medicine on Monday mornings before I come up here, I get an \nearful. What I am hearing is, shape up, start doing the priorities we \nwant you to do. Make the tough decisions.\n  It is easy for me to earmark something in Oklahoma, isn't it? If I \ncome to the Senator--maybe not after this discussion this morning, but \nnormally--this may have something to do\n\n[[Page S11611]]\n\nwith the St. Louis Cardinals last night. I don't know. My condolences. \nThey are the best team in baseball. I give my condolences to the \nSenator. I am sorry the Cardinals aren't there. I hope that will impact \nhis collegiality today as we go through all these amendments.\n\n  However, the American people expect Congress to start doing a better \njob about priorities. I didn't say anything about cutting out all \ncommunity development block grants. I haven't said anything about that.\n  The amendments I will have today are very specific amendments. I try \nto run from the press. I am not trying to get in the press. What I am \ntrying to do is start down a road that says if we want to be here and \ngovern, we ought to start listening to the overall trend of the \nAmerican people and our oath of office. What is that oath? That oath is \nto follow the Constitution and follow that Constitution to represent \nthis country in its best long-term--not short-term, not for me to get \nreelected, but what is in the best long-term interest of our country.\n  How can anyone say today, with $600 billion added to our \ngrandchildren in terms of debt, with a war going on, with Katrina going \non, with a hurricane coming to Florida, that we ought to spend half a \nmillion building a sculpture park in Washington State? I can't see that \nanybody would agree to that. It is a wonderful idea, but not now. There \nare other ways to build this--contributions, State funds. There is a \npotential that this will still get built even if we do not send money, \nbut that ought to be a priority the people of Washington State make, \nnot that we make, to take the Federal taxpayer dollars from the rest of \nthe country and say we are going to do that.\n  I yield to the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, before I turn it over to the Senator from \nWashington, as I said to the Senator, we have a difference in \nphilosophy. I commended him publicly for his tremendous service to \nOklahoma--specifically the fact that he continues his practice of \nobstetrics. However, we have very different philosophies on how we \nserve our people.\n  If he has told the people of Oklahoma how he is going to serve \nOklahoma, that is fine. I have told the people of Missouri how I am \ngoing to serve Missouri. I believe I am living up to that. Now, I don't \nsay that he isn't living up in any stretch of the imagination to the \npledge he made to the people of Oklahoma. What I am saying is, I am not \ngoing to tell the people of Oklahoma how their Senator should behave. I \nexpect the Senator from Oklahoma would not be telling the Senator from \nMissouri how to behave.\n  If he is talking about saving money, this does not cut the budget. \nThe CDBG pot is 8 percent lower. The Senator may or may not have been \nin private sessions when I proposed a major means of reducing the \nbudget to be considered by the Committee on the Budget. We are staying \nin line with what the Committee on the Budget has proposed. The \nCommittee on the Budget may come back with a recommendation, which I \nwill be for if it cuts everything fairly.\n  We are talking about how money is actually spent, economic \ndevelopment initiatives. Yes, they can go to things like parks if they \nhave them in communities. And the question is, Who makes those \ndecisions? Well, for those decisions in Missouri, I spend enough time \nand my people spend enough time that I want a say in how funds are \nspent because I talk to and listen to those people. I hear what their \nrequests are. It is a small fraction of the Federal money that goes to \nthe State.\n  But I am proud of the progress we have been able to make by \nsupporting local initiatives through EDI funds. HUD bureaucrats make \nsome good decisions. If we cut all these out, they will make all the \ndecisions. They may make some good ones, they may make some bad ones, \nbut in Missouri, I can make those better than a bureaucrat. That is \nwhat we are talking about. We are not going to save a nickel. If any of \nthese are agreed to, we will distinguish between the philosophies of \nservice.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma has eloquently stated his philosophy. He \nbelieves we ought to restrain spending. And I agree: we ought to \nrestrain spending. The question is, How do you prioritize the spending \nin the budget? That is where we have a disagreement.\n  We will have an opportunity for our colleagues to determine which \nphilosophy they agree with. Do you want the bureaucrats solely to make \nthe decisions, or should Senators be able to influence a small portion \nof those? That is the question, quite simply. It is not about saving \nmoney it is about who makes those decisions. We have two very different \nphilosophies.\n  I have great respect for my colleague from Oklahoma. He has offered a \ndifferent philosophy to his people in being elected than I have offered \nto my people in Missouri who have elected me.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator that we ought to \nbe involved in where the money is spent. As a matter of fact, we ought \nto be so involved that we ought to write the bills much more \nspecifically, all the way down to the job and the title. One of the \nthings we do not do--we leave too much open to bureaucrats.\n\n  In contrast for a minute, I agree this will not reduce the spending. \nBut $500,000 that is going to go for a sculpture park means $500,000 \nthat will not go for a water treatment plant or will not go for housing \nfor somebody who has a need for housing. It will not accomplish the \npositive benefits the HUD bill is designed to accomplish in the first \nplace.\n  I thank the Senator from Missouri for his debate. I again request a \nvote on this amendment. I am willing to allow the Senator from \nWashington to debate this with me as well, and after that, I will \nsuggest the absence of a quorum so we can discuss the other amendments.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Bond in \nstrongly opposing the Coburn amendment and the numerous other \namendments he has filed with the same type of philosophy, as he calls \nit, in the Senate.\n  I join with my colleague from Missouri, the chairman of this \ncommittee. I, like him, go home every single weekend to Washington \nState, which is 2,500 miles away from the Nation's Capital. I, like the \nSenator from Missouri, do not believe the bureaucrats sitting in \nWashington, DC, know what is happening on the ground in my home State \n2,500 miles away from here. I am out there. I am out in every \ncommunity, talking to people, listening to them, knowing what their \nconcerns are, knowing what they are developing within their own \ncommunities, within their own cities, within their own capabilities, to \nhelp stimulate the economy and to do good things. It is my job to be \ntheir partner in that. I tell them that all the time. You get it going \non the ground here, you develop the projects, you get the consensus \nwithin your own communities, and I will do what I can to get some small \npart of help from the Federal Government. That is how I, like most \nSenators in the Senate, am sent projects.\n  Last year, I was in Yakima Valley and talked to our farmers out \nthere. This is a remote community. They are struggling with putting \ntogether a clinic. I talked to them. They developed the ideas at the \nlocal level and put together a building, a job training center, to \nassist our State's large farmworker community to help further their \neducation and acquire some critical new skills. This was an important \nproject for them. I was able to come back here and partner with \n$500,000 from the Federal Government to help stimulate that project to \nmake sure it was going to succeed.\n  Another time, I was traveling in King County, talking to community \nleaders there who were working to fund a Greenbridge community center \nin the heart of an exciting Hope VI project that is bringing affordable \nhousing and economic development to one of the poorest communities in \nKing County. I came back here. It is my job to represent a State that \nis thousands of miles away from here, and I flew back and said I will \ndo my part to help with this important project. And we were able to get \n$500,000.\n  Today, the Senator from Oklahoma has targeted another project that I \nsat down and discussed with local community leaders. I didn't come up \nwith this. This came from the heart of my local community because they \nare working very hard in an urban core in the city of Seattle to turn a \nbrownfield into a hub of activity. It is a project\n\n[[Page S11612]]\n\nthat is stimulating jobs and investments. That is exactly what this EDI \nprogram is intended to do. We didn't need to cut investments to clean \nup brownfields to produce jobs. We need more projects like this.\n  If the Senator from Oklahoma wants to look for a culprit for the \nfiscal situation in this country, he should look into the billions and \nbillions of dollars in tax cuts that have been granted to \nmultimillionaires in this country, and he should look at additional tax \ncuts his party wants to implement in future years if he wants to find \nincredible savings.\n  To take apart a Senator's projects, who worked very hard, as I have \nand as the Senator from Missouri has, the Senator from Rhode Island, \nthe Senator from Mississippi, and the Senator from Nebraska have done \nwith their projects and numerous other Senators who have gone home like \nwe have, listened to the leadership in their communities, heard their \nprojects, filtered through them as we have had to because we do not \nhave a lot of money in these accounts, and said these are the ones we \nwill partner with you at the Federal level and put into this bill.\n  The Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury, the Judiciary, Housing \nand Urban Development, and Related Agencies, under the leadership of my \ncapable colleague from Missouri, Senator Bond, has been respectful and \nresponsive to requests of Senators who have come up with projects. \nContrary to the representation that some Members have made in the \nSenate, these EDI projects we are talking about are not the centerpiece \nof our efforts of community development in this bill. In fact, they are \nfar from it. The funding for these EDI projects that the Senator from \nOklahoma is targeting amounts to less than 8 percent of the overall \nfunding we provide in this bill for HUD's community development fund.\n  In fact, my colleagues should remember that President Bush's budget \nlooked to take the Community Development Block Grant Program out of \nthis bill and fund it in the Department of Commerce while cutting its \nfunding by more than a third. Senator Bond and I fought to continue the \nfunding for the CDBG Program in our bill because we all heard from our \nlocal communities how important these funds were for development across \nthe country.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma now comes to the Senate with a series of \namendments targeting a few States to pick out individually named \nprojects and eliminate those projects' funding. We are not going to go \ndown that road. There are criteria that pertain to the funding for the \nproject that I have, for the project the Senator from Oklahoma has, the \nproject from Nebraska, the project from Missouri, the project from \nMississippi, the project from Rhode Island, and the other projects on \nwhich he has amendments. There are criteria for these. They are not \nrandom. These funds have to be used for capital expenses rather than \noperating costs. None of the funds are dedicated to for-profit \nentities. The vast majority are dedicated to projects in \nunderprivileged communities.\n  I don't care if it is my project, Senator Bond's project, Senator \nNelson's project, Senator Chafee's project, or the other projects that \nthe Senator from Oklahoma has randomly picked to target, the Senators \nthat have EDI projects in this bill--and that, by the way, is almost \nevery Senator in this Senate--are going to have to stand together. We \nare not going to watch the Senator pick out one project and make it \ninto a whipping boy.\n  Now, it is true that Senator Bond and I allow Senators to allocate \nEDI funds to those projects in their States that they think make best \nuse of the funds. We do not make any apology for that practice.\n  As the Senator from Missouri has said--which I agree with, I do not \nthink the bureaucrats at the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment know better than I do--a Senator from a State thousands of \nmiles away from here, who goes home every single weekend and is on the \nground talking to community leaders in every county and every city in \nmy State, and hearing from them what they think is important.\n  We do not choose these projects randomly sitting on high from back \nhere. We go out and talk to our community leaders. They tell us this \nproject, the one the Senator has decided to target, is a project, as I \nsaid, that is turning a brownfield into a hub of an urban center, into \na center of activity, and it is critical for their economic \ndevelopment.\n  When the community leaders come together, and they have a consensus \nfor it, and they have built the funding for it in the State, it is my \njob, I believe, to represent my State, which is thousands of miles away \nfrom here, and to come back and be an advocate for them.\n  I don't know that the bureaucrats at the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development ever take the opportunity to go out and sit on the \nground in my State. It is my job to do that. I take it seriously. And I \nam happy to come back here and fight for them, such as most of the \nother Senators have done who have given us EDI projects in this bill \nthis year--next year or the following year.\n  There is not a lot of money in these accounts. We allocate them \ncorrectly. I sat across the table from the Senator from Missouri in the \nBudget Committee for many years, and I can vouch for him that he is not \nsomeone who spends money randomly. He and I have disagreed, in fact, on \nbudgets and spending over the years, but I do know that he takes his \njob seriously, to make sure we spend the taxpayers' dollars wisely. He \nvotes, every time, for a budget where most of the time I say I am \nwilling to spend more than he does. He cuts those budgets. And we have \ndone so this year.\n  It is a very tight budget year. Our committee is operating within the \nconfines of that budget. I commend my colleague from Missouri for doing \nso because I know how many requests we got for funding within this \nbill. It was a tough year. I watched him work his way through a bill, \ntelling Members of the Senate that he could not fund all their \nprojects. But he has moved this bill forward under the confines of that \nbudget.\n  It is our job to make sure that every Senator has the ability we have \nto go home to their States, listen to their community leaders, and then \nbe their partner in the Senate for this small amount of EDI funding \nthat is available. These projects in this bill have to fall under the \ncriteria that the EDI funds do so, and we make sure they do.\n  I hope the Senate will not go down the road of cherry-picking \nindividual projects that Senators have come to us and have championed \non behalf of their constituents who do not live here in Washington, DC. \nI hope we do not go down the road deciding we know better than home \nState Senators about the merits of the projects they bring to us.\n  As the old saying goes: What is good for the goose is good for the \ngander. And I tell my colleagues, if we start cutting funding for \nindividual projects, your project may be next.\n  So, Mr. President, when Members come down to the floor to vote on \nthis amendment, they need to know if they support stripping out this \nproject, Senator Bond and I are likely to be taking a long, serious \nlook at their projects to determine whether they should be preserved \nduring our upcoming conference negotiations.\n  We must not and we will not go down the road of picking on one \nSenator or another on the floor of the Senate. I urge a no vote on this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, what we heard was a cultural difference. \nWhat we heard is: If you vote for this amendment, anything that you \nhave in this bill may not be preserved in conference. Now think about \nthat. I want the American people to hear that. If we tend to think that \na sculpture park is not as high a priority as housing people who are \nhomeless, and we vote to take that out, the threat has now been made \nthat if you vote that way, then you will not be able to do something \nthat may be a higher or lower priority.\n  I have the greatest respect for the Senator from Washington. I know \nshe travels hard. I know she works well into the night to represent the \nconstituency of the State of Washington.\n  This is a start to forcing us to make priorities. I am happy she is \nhere to defend this. She believes it is more important than housing. I \nthink that is fine. She does not believe the guidelines of the CDBG are \nappropriate to\n\n[[Page S11613]]\n\ngive the State of Washington what it needs.\n  But I believe it is important we start putting in front of the \nAmerican people what we are doing. I believe, with a $600 billion \naddition to the debt for this last year alone--being passed on to our \ngrandchildren--which is $2,000 per man, woman, and child, it is time we \nchanged. There is nothing personal about it. There is nothing about \nanything intended toward the Senator from Washington. It is about a \nreal assessment the American people need to know. Is this more \nimportant than housing the 17,590 people who are homeless in the State \nof Washington? That is the kind of priority I think we need to make.\n  The other thing I would say is, if we have a problem with the \nbureaucracy, we have all the power in the world to change that. We have \nthe power right here to change that. So we can either change the \nbureaucracy so it reflects the views of the people of this country or \nwe can go about it the wrong way and have to control it by taking a \nvery small percentage of the budget. We get two bad results from that. \nWe get poor priorities. And, No. 2, we are not doing our job in \ncontrolling the bureaucracy.\n  So I am prepared to ask that this amendment be set aside and continue \nwith another amendment in a moment. But at this time, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we have spoken with the parties, and we \nbelieve we have come to an agreement to have a vote at 12:20, with the \ntime equally divided between the Senator from Oklahoma and--how much \ntime does the Senator from Oklahoma want?\n  Mr. COBURN. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. Ten minutes for the Senator from Oklahoma, 10 minutes for \nthe Senator from Nebraska, and I will reserve 5 minutes for the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island. I will take that time on his behalf if he is not \nable to make it. So that will make a vote at 12:15 in relation to the \namendment or the amendment, as modified.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank my colleagues.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2093\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit any funds under the Act from being used for a \n   parking facility as part of the Joslyn Art Museum Master Plan, in \n                            Omaha, Nebraska)\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2093 and ask that \nit be considered and read.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the pending \namendment will be set aside. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2093.\n       On page 348, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 321. JOSLYN ART MUSEUM.\n\n       None of the funds made available for the Department of \n     Housing and Urban Development under the heading ``Community \n     Development Fund'' in this title, shall be available for a \n     parking facility as part of the Joslyn Art Museum Master \n     Plan, in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, again, this is not an amendment about this \nbeing a bad idea. I am sure this is a parking lot that is needed. The \npurpose of this amendment is to talk about priorities.\n  The number of homeless people in Nebraska is 3,268. This is an \namendment that spends, I believe, $950,000 to build assets for a \nprivate museum that was started in 1931. Again, no doubt this is \nneeded. In this time of $600 billion that we added this last year to \nour grandchildren's debt, in this time of war, in this time of \nhurricanes times two in the gulf and one coming to Florida again, the \nfact that we would spend close to $1 million on a parking facility \ninstead of putting that to the area where we meet more human needs, to \nme, seems to be the wrong priority.\n  Fiscal year 2004 reports by the Joslyn Art Museum showed they had a \nnet surplus that year alone of $1,998,000. They have assets of $66 \nmillion and working capital of $6.5 million.\n  The question I am raising with this amendment is, Is this the right \npriority at this time? It is not whether this is a legitimate effort on \nthe part of those who are associated with the Joslyn Art Museum master \nplan in Omaha, NE, to expand. They spent $3.5 million purchasing an \nadditional football field so they would have additional expansion. But \nat a time when we are at war, at a time when we have the greatest \nnatural catastrophe that has ever hit this country, and at a time when \nwe have fiscal deficits that are as far as we can see, and an oil \ncrisis, an energy crisis affecting us, the question is whether this is \nthe right place to spend our money.\n  I understand if this money is not spent on this, it will be spent on \nsomething else. And I know this does not cut the money from the overall \nappropriations bill. But there is a grant process for this. We control \nthe grant process. We control the requirements for the grant process. \nWe can, as a legislative body, direct that the grant process is open, \ncompetitive, and fair.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, apparently the Nebraska-\nOklahoma game, which is to be played later this month, is occurring \ntoday.\n  I have a great deal of respect for my colleague from Oklahoma and his \ndesire to watch the Treasury and to establish priorities, but I will \nput up my credentials for watching the priorities and for watching the \nspending as well.\n  The Community Development Fund Program has been put in place to deal \nwith this priority. In Washington, DC, there can be many priorities. \nThe business of the Senate, the business of government runs on numerous \ntracks, not a single priority. There are many priorities, and it is up \nto us to balance those priorities. But in balancing the priorities, we \nmust keep in mind that the community development funds are designed so \nthat Members of the Senate can go home and listen to the communities as \nto what they need and what will work best for their development, for \ntheir particular needs. It is an opportunity to get away from what \nhappens in Washington so very often: nameless, faceless, hired \nbureaucrats who make a decision about what a community needs rather \nthan the elected officials who, in consultation with the communities, \nare then able to help establish those priorities.\n  There are many priorities, and this is a priority as well, a priority \nfor one of the crown jewels of the plains, the Jocelyn Museum, an art \nmuseum that is largely funded by private funds, as my colleague has \nsuggested. But I think that partnerships between public and private \nentities are not only commonplace but necessary in order to continue to \nhave the fabric of life that this represents.\n  This is not choosing against other priorities. I think my colleague \nknows that the Katrina victims will be taken care of. I think he knows \nthat other priorities will be met, but that we must, in fact, balance \nall the priorities that we are faced with in deciding here in \nWashington, DC.\n  In assisting communities with their development, these funds were \nmade available for projects just like this one and the other ones that \nare in question in Washington and Rhode Island. So to suggest there is \nsomething inappropriate about this in terms of priorities is \nunfortunate. It is unfortunate for a number of reasons.\n  No. 1, we are not here challenging decisions made for grants that \nmight be established by the bureaucracy which, on their face, seem to \nhave more credibility even though, in my opinion, they have less \ncredibility.\n  In addition, we have to recognize that this priority has met the test \nof what is necessary to help this private institution in dealing with a \npublic school to make available for that public school athletic \nfacilities and an exchange--once again, a public-private partnership \nthat was created.\n  That public-private partnership preceded this public-private \npartnership, and this is an opportunity to continue those kinds of \nrelationships.\n  I go to Nebraska and I listen to my communities. I listen to the \nleaders. And based on what they tell me their needs are, I am able to \ncome back and\n\n[[Page S11614]]\n\ntry to establish these kinds of funds available, then make them \navailable for those needs.\n  I object to singling out one or two or three of these projects as \nthough there is something inappropriate about their priority. There is \nnothing inappropriate about their priority.\n  I reserve what remains of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for my \ncolleague from Nebraska. As a matter of fact, I am worried about his \nfootball team hurting the Oklahoma football team this year. But I will \nsay, we view priorities differently. What about the priority of our \ngrandchildren? I will say it again. This last year, through our \nleadership, $2,000 per man, woman, and child was added to the debt of \nthis country. That is a loadstone around a 2-year-old child. Last year \nwe added $1,700.\n  The reason for these amendments is to get us to start thinking about \nchoosing priorities. The Senator from Nebraska was not here when I gave \nmy opening statement. I am not trying to pick on Nebraska. I am trying \nto pick on our process. The fact is we can change every aspect of how \nthe grant-writing process goes if we want to and we can make it work.\n  The reason we do not trust bureaucrats is we do not hold them \naccountable because we do not do the work we need to do to create the \nchange in the bureaucracy. So first I would offer no personal offense \nto my friend from Nebraska. He does have my respect. But when a private \ninstitution is worth $66 million, has a cash working capital of $6.5 \nmillion and has $1.998 million in the bank, we are going to take a \npriority that says this money we are going to spend here rather than on \nsomething that has a better priority. That is all I am saying. I am not \nsaying this is bad. I am saying there should be a better priority for \nour spending.\n  My hope is by going through this process we will all start looking. I \nbelieve this is a sincere effort on the part of the Senator from \nNebraska to do what he thinks is great for Nebraska. My feeling is--and \nthere is lots I would like to challenge in the spending that goes \nthrough our earmarks--and I have said before the Senator came on the \nfloor, if we were in surplus I would not be talking about any of these. \nI think the difference is we are not. So when we direct programs for \ninstitutions that have the assets to pay for it themselves, our \ngrandchildren do not get great value. That is my only point.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Point of inquiry: How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise again to deal with the \nquestion about priorities. There are many priorities we must face as a \ncountry. We do have priorities to deal with Katrina. We have priorities \nto deal with the cost of the war. We also have to deal with the \npriorities that deal with the fabric of life for Americans wherever we \nlive and whatever we do.\n  One of the ways in which we try to establish those priorities is by \ntalking to the people who send us here, the people who pay the taxes \nthat are sometimes redistributed in ways that will raise questions \nabout priorities.\n  I do not think there is any question but what the priority this \nraises is an important priority as part of the community development \nfunds. It has been a long-established practice to set aside these funds \nfor similar situations as the ones that are called into question today \nby my colleague from Oklahoma.\n  There is nothing wrong with calling these priorities into question, \nbut to single them out with respect to all the other priorities he may \nhave in mind is unfortunate because it only draws attention to one, \ntwo, or three of these projects as though these are all by themselves \nthe priorities that are being dealt with.\n  These community development funds are broad based. They apply to \nvirtually every State. I have not checked to see what Oklahoma might \nget or what my other colleagues might get, but I do believe it is far \nbetter for the Members of the Senate to go home and listen to their \ncommunities and listen to their leaders and come back with this type of \nan approach, rather than continuing to see the grant process that the \nbureaucracy continues to provide and is not held accountable in the \nsame way this is being held accountable. I will be held accountable and \nmy colleagues will be held accountable for trying to do the right \nthings for our States, for the people and for the fabric of life in \nthose communities and in those States.\n  I say today that I hope our colleagues will recognize the importance \nof these community development funds and the grants they represent \nbecause a good part of why we are here is to take care of \nresponsibilities back home. That is why we go home on weekends, to find \nout what is necessary in those communities.\n  Others will always have some question about whether it is this \npriority or that priority. We have to make those choices. In my \nopinion, this has been a good choice.\n  I yield back the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2093, as Modified\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify my EDI \namendment to include the three projects, Washington, Nebraska, and \nRhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2093), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     JOSLYN ART MUSEUM.\n\n       None of the funds made available for the Department of \n     Housing and Urban Development under the heading ``Community \n     Development Fund'' in this title, shall be available for a \n     parking facility as part of the Joslyn Art Museum Master \n     Plan, in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\n     STAND UP FOR ANIMALS.\n\n       None of the funds made available for the Department of \n     Housing and Urban Development under the heading ``Community \n     Development Fund'' in this title, shall be available for \n     Stand Up for Animals in Westerly, Rhode Island for building \n     construction.\n\n     SEATTLE ART MUSEUM.\n\n       None of the funds made available for the Department of \n     Housing and Urban Development under the heading ``Community \n     Development Fund'' in this title, shall be available for the \n     Seattle Art Museum in Seattle, Washington for the \n     construction of the Olympic Sculpture Park.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I will spend a few moments talking about \nthe last of these three that are going to be considered. This is \nanother project where we are spending $200,000 for the construction of \nan animal shelter when we cannot even shelter the people properly in \nLouisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi.\n  Now, $200,000 could go a long way to provide temporary housing right \nnow for the people in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. This is \n$200,000 toward a $2.2 million facility to house 120 cats and 45 dogs, \nwith a dog obedience school and classroom settings for youth.\n  If one looks at HUD's Web site, the mission is to increase \nhomeownership, support community development, and increase access to \naffordable housing free from discrimination. It does not say anything \nabout animals in it and, at best, it is a satirical exaggeration of the \ngoal.\n  This funding has been proposed for this organization despite the fact \nthat this is a 501(c)(3) organization that has already received \n$900,000 in charitable contributions.\n  I remind the Senate there are 7,814 people in Rhode Island who do not \nhave homes at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Unfortunately, Senator Chafee is tied up. We are expecting \nmomentarily to get a full explanation. Our debate has focused on the \ndifference in philosophy. The Senator from Nebraska, the Senator from \nWashington, the Senator from Rhode Island, and I all have the ability \nto establish priorities in the economic development initiatives. They \nare important initiatives and important priorities that can be set by \nSenators.\n  In the case of the provision for the Senator from Rhode Island, this \nhappens to be construction of a building that is very important for the \nquality of life in the town of Westerly, RI.\n\n[[Page S11615]]\n\nMany people have different needs and one of the beauties of that is the \npeople from those communities can talk directly to their Senator and \ntell their Senator what is important.\n  In this instance, the Senator from Rhode Island listened to the \npeople. He listened to his constituents. He determined this was a \npriority. There is going to be a lot of other money that is going to be \nhanded out by HUD bureaucrats under the economic development initiative \nfor construction. What is wrong with the Senator from Rhode Island \nsaying here is one pressing need that is very important for the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island because it is important to his constituents?\n  I reserve the balance of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, the time will be charged equally to all sides.\n  Mr. BOND. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2158 to Amendment No. 2133\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask unanimous consent that we return to the \nconsideration of Dorgan amendment No. 2133 for a moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is pending.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2158 to amendment No. 2133.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit taking \n   minors across State lines in circumvention of laws requiring the \n             involvement of parents in abortion decisions)\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert the following:\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Child \n     Custody Protection Act''.\n       (b) Transportation of Minors in Circumvention of Certain \n     Laws Relating to Abortion.--\n       (1) In general.--Title 18, United States Code, is amended \n     by inserting after chapter 117 the following:\n\n ``CHAPTER 117A--TRANSPORTATION OF MINORS IN CIRCUMVENTION OF CERTAIN \n                       LAWS RELATING TO ABORTION\n\n``Sec\n``2431.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair. The floor is now open for debate and \nfurther amendment as requested.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2077\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I take a moment of the Senate's time to \nreiterate my very strong support for the amendment offered by my \ncolleague and friend, Senator Reed of Rhode Island, and my colleague, \nSenator Kerry, and myself on increasing emergency funding for the \nLIHEAP program. This program is a lifeline to many poor individuals on \nfixed incomes in my state of Massachusetts and across the nation. It is \nthe help and assistance that is provided to low-income, elderly and \ndisabled households to defray the steep costs of home heating. The \naverage LIHEAP household has an income of less than $10 thousand. These \nindividuals are trying to make ends meet.\n  According to the Energy Information Administration of the Energy \nDepartment, this year natural gas prices for heating one's home will \nincrease by almost 50 percent over last year, home heating oil will \nincrease 32 percent, electricity will increase 5 percent. In \nMassachusetts, the current average price per gallon of heating oil is \n$2.51. This is an increase of 30 percent over the average price per \ngallon last October.\n  These aren't just abstract numbers. They represent huge burdens on \nreal people. Just last week, Mayor Menino and I met with low-income \nseniors at the Curtis Hall Community Center in Massachusetts. These \nfamilies are caught between a rock and a hard place about how they are \ngoing to pay their heating bills. Are they going to cut back on food? \nAre they going to cut back on prescription drugs which are so \nnecessary? Are they going to try and continue to put the temperature \nlevel down to such a low degree that it threatens their health and \nwell-being? Those are the cruel choices they are faced with today.\n  So many senior citizens are looking into the future, they are looking \nat the impact of sky-rocketing heating bills over the course of the \nwinter, and they are frightened and scared. They are wondering who is \ngoing to give them some help and assistance.\n  Our amendment increases emergency funding for the LIHEAP program by \n$3.1 billion. This funding on top of the President's budget request for \n$2 billion would bring the program to $5.1 billion -the level \nauthorized in the Energy Policy Act of 2005.\n  Funding for LIHEAP has been stagnant for more than a decade. It has \nseen significant loss in terms of purchasing power. We have a program \nthat has been stagnant for over 10 years, the program has lost \npurchasing power, and absolutely dramatic increases in heating bills. \nWe need to provide help and assistance to low income families. This \namendment provides that much needed assistance.\n  I hope we have broad support. This is an essential amendment. We can \ntalk about food; we can talk about medicines. We ought to put heat \nright in that same category.\n  I will mention some of the low income individuals struggling to \nsurvive: Wilhelmina Mathis of Dorchester. Wilhelmina is 71 years old \nand lives alone. She keeps her thermostat set at 60 degrees to save \nmoney. She hopes the Federal Government will come through with more \nLIHEAP money before she runs out of a way to pay her heating bill. She \nsays:\n\n       I turn down the thermostat as low as I can and sometimes I \n     turn it off and put on extra sweaters. I don't know now much \n     longer I can keep doing this.''\n\n  Jacqueline Arroyo of Roxbury, MA, is a single mom who lives in \nRoxbury with her baby daughter Jessica. She is a nurse who lost her job \nin August 2004 and has been working temporary jobs ever since. Her \nsalary has not been enough to cover all of her bills. Her electricity \nbill is now $4,000, and she worries about how she will pay off the debt \nbefore this winter.\n  Emory Baily has MS, and it is hard for him to get around. Now the \ncomfort of his home is in jeopardy. Any day the heating oil will run \nout. The assistance he receives from LIHEAP has run out as temperatures \nbegin to fall.\n  In Boston, a 79-year-old man lives with a sick wife. He worked hard \non a loading dock most of his life and retired with a pension, but he \nhas a hard time paying all the bills. He receives LIHEAP benefits, but \nthe fuel oil assistance has been exhausted. We are not even halfway \nthrough the winter.\n  In Haverhill, MA, a single mother lives with her 18-year-old son, who \nis handicapped, her 19-year-old daughter, and her daughter's child, who \nhas a medical condition. Both mother and daughter are employed as \nschool bus monitors. They have little or no income over the summer. \nTheir rent is $950 a month. Their last gas bill was $1,729. Because \nthey could not pay their gas bill, their gas was shut off. Even if they \nqualify for $600 in LIHEAP assistance, the gas company may refuse to \nreconnect the service unless the family comes up with another $400 to \n$800 toward the back pay.\n  These are typical families. This is the issue we have before the \nSenate. It is truly a life-and-death situation. It certainly deserves \nthe support of our colleagues in the Senate. I hope that will be \nreflected in the vote at 2:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is Coburn amendment No. \n2091.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2065\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment \nbe set aside and that I be allowed to call up amendment No. 2065.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself, \n     Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Levin, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Specter, \n     Mr. Brownback, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n     Hagel, and Mr. Santorum, proposes an amendment numbered 2065.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to dispense with \nthe reading of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To extend certain apportionments to primary airports)\n\n       On page 229, between lines 12 and 13, insert the following:\n       (c) Section 47114(c)(1)(F) of title 49, United States Code, \n     is amended by striking ``and 2005'' each place it appears in \n     the text and in the heading and inserting ``, 2005, and \n     2006''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this is an amendment I offer on behalf \nof myself, Senator Specter, Senator Nelson of Nebraska, Senator Levin, \nSenator Stabenow, Senator Brownback, Senator Rockefeller, Senator \nHarkin, Senator Durbin, Senator Hagel, and Senator Santorum. This is a \nbipartisan amendment which tries to assist many of our smaller airports \naround the country.\n  Under the current formula in the statute, airports that have at least \n10,000 boardings each year are called primary airports. Those airports \nreceive entitlement of $1 million per year from the FAA's Airport \nImprovement Program. The nonprimary airports--those that do not have \nthe 10,000 annual boardings--receive only $150,000.\n  In the wake of September 11, many airports saw their annual boardings \nplummet. There were a number of these smaller primary airports, many in \nrural areas, that faced the temporary loss of their $1 million annual \nentitlement.\n\n[[Page S11617]]\n\n  Vision 100, which is Public Law 108-176, gave certain primary \nairports 2 years--fiscal year 2004 and 2005--to regain that minimum \n10,000 boarding level. During that time, they retained the annual $1 \nmillion entitlement they had been receiving. These airports are \ndesignated as virtual primary airports in the statute. The 2-year grace \nperiod in Vision 100 for the virtual primary airports expired on \nSeptember 30, just a few weeks ago.\n  The amendment I am offering today to the legislation before the \nSenate gives the virtual primary airports 1 additional year--fiscal \nyear 2006--to regain a level of 10,000 boarding. Many of the virtual \nprimary airports saw substantial increases in their boardings in fiscal \nyear 2004. There are 10 fewer airports that need this extension for \nfiscal year 2006 than would have needed it or that did need it in \nfiscal year 2005.\n  This is the right thing to do. This is important to many of our \nStates. I have a list of all the airports that will be adversely \naffected if we do not agree to this provision. One of those airports is \nin my home State in Roswell, NM, that is in danger of losing this \nfunding if we do not extend this for 1 additional year.\n  This is a bipartisan bill. We have 11 cosponsors of the legislation. \nIt is good legislation. The policy is good. We have gone to the \nCongressional Budget Office and they have indicated there is no score \nattached to this bill. This is not a money issue. There is not going to \nbe an increased burden on the taxpayer. I very much urge my colleagues \nto support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2077\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to take a couple minutes to \ntalk about the amendment to fully fund the Low Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program, what we call LIHEAP.\n  Americans have already been slammed by outrageously high gas prices. \nThe average price for a gallon of regular unleaded gas in New Jersey is \nnow $2.65. That is 37 percent higher than a year ago.\n  For an average New Jersey motorist, a tank of gas now costs about \n$46, which is $12.50 more than a year ago. That extra $12.50 for every \ntank of gas adds up to a cost of more than $400 a year for the average \nmotorist--a new cost for their transportation needs with their cars.\n  It is affecting our quality of life. Driving to work or taking your \nchildren to school is not a luxury, nor is a visit to the doctor, nor \nis a visit to a shop. These things are all necessities. That is a \nterrible mistake because we have to make sure we do not misunderstand \nor misquote the importance of this extra cost to the average family. It \nis particularly onerous for those who do not have the choice of using \ntransit.\n  Families have sacrificed substantially. They have cut back on lots of \nthings. According to a new survey by AARP, almost 40 percent of \nAmericans over the age of 50 have had to reduce their visits with \nfamily and friends because of high gas prices.\n  I have even spoken to people who run businesses that are not on a \ntransit route or a bus route of any kind. They tell me their business \nhas fallen off substantially. And people who work there--a lot of \npeople with very modest jobs--have been very seriously affected.\n  Forty-one percent of the people the AARP was talking about have cut \nback on spending. That includes food and medicine.\n  Gas price increases have been a heavy blow, and now we are about to \nget hit again by higher home heating costs. According to all \npredictions, heating oil and natural gas prices will increase more than \ngasoline prices have increased.\n  Now, some people can lower their thermostats by a few degrees; and \nthose who can, should. But heating a family home is not a luxury. It is \na necessity, like putting food on the table. It is a level of comfort \nthat is required to be met that cannot be ignored. That is why we have \nto support LIHEAP.\n  Last week, Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman said increasing the support \nfor LIHEAP is ``not on the agenda.'' Not on the agenda? That is hard to \nunderstand. Maybe someone with a lofty position such as the Secretary \ncan discard it as a noncritical situation. But if a child shivers at \nhome while he or she tries to study or while they sit there with their \nfamilies to have some conversation--maybe what this Government of ours \nought to do is ship out blankets to everybody, or shawls they can wrap \naround their shoulders. You tell the senior citizen who has to choose \nbetween buying medicine or paying the heating bill that the Government \nis not going to help them through this crisis.\n  Helping families heat their homes should be near the top of our \nagenda. The Secretary's statement is outrageous. It is a sad commentary \non the priorities of this administration. I don't think any Member of \nthis body would walk into a modest-income family home and turn off \ntheir heat in the middle of winter. But voting against this amendment \nis going to have the same effect for thousands of low-income families.\n  We cannot leave American families out in the cold. We have to support \nthe Reed-Collins LIHEAP amendment and give families a helping hand \nthrough what some suggest is going to be a fairly cold winter. With \nweather as erratic as it is, we cannot tell what is going to happen.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope we will be able to adopt this amendment.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for as much time as I shall consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Fiscal Condition Of The Country\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about a \nrecent report in the Washington Post about the fiscal condition of the \ncountry. This was an article that appeared Saturday in the Washington \nPost, reporting on the budget deficit. It had this very hopeful \nheadline: ``Federal Deficit Fell in Past Year.'' While that is true, I \nthink it is largely misleading as to the financial condition of the \ncountry.\n  When I went into the article, I read this paragraph:\n\n       The 2005 deficit was the third-largest ever. But it was not \n     only markedly smaller than the record $412.85 billion \n     [deficit] for 2004, it was also well below the forecasts for \n     the year issued in February. As a proportion of the economy--\n     it equaled about 2.6 percent of gross domestic product--the \n     deficit was within bounds that most economists consider \n     manageable, and far from the levels of the 1980s, when the \n     deficit reached nearly 6 percent of GDP.\n\n  I think if the average person were to read that, they would think: \nGee, things are headed in the right direction. The deficit is down. The \ndeficit is, as a share of GDP, gross domestic product, well below where \nit was in the 1980s.\n  The problem with this report is, I think it is completely misleading \nto the American people as to our true fiscal condition. Why? Well, \nfirst, because the deficit calculation that is used so broadly by the \npress--and I am not singling out the Washington Post here. I would also \npoint the finger at almost all of the mainstream media that continually \nrefer to the deficit and never talk about the debt.\n  Here is the difference. While it is true the deficit last year was \n$319 billion, that is not the amount by which the debt increased. This \nis a critically important difference people need to understand. The \ndebt last year did not increase by $319 billion, the advertised \ndeficit. The debt increased by $551 billion.\n  I find repeatedly, when I go around my home State of North Dakota, \nthere is great confusion about the deficit and the debt. Most people \nbelieve the increase in the deficit matches the increase in the \ndebt. But that is not the case. The debt is increasing by much more \nthan the reported deficit.\n\n  Here is the biggest reason why: Social Security funds that are being \nused to pay for other things. In effect, the Social Security trust \nfunds are being raided consistently, repeatedly, in order to pay other \nbills. If any private sector entity tried to do what is being\n\n[[Page S11618]]\n\ndone here, they would be on their way to a Federal institution, but it \nwould not be the Congress. It would not be the White House. They would \nbe on their way to a Federal penitentiary because it is a violation of \nFederal law to take the retirement funds of employees and use them to \npay operating expenses. That is exactly what is going on here.\n  It happened last year to the tune of $173 billion. It is not included \nin the deficit calculation. Why not? Because that is borrowing of one \nGovernment entity from another Government entity. So they don't include \nit in the deficit, but it is included in the increase in the debt. \nEvery penny of this has to be paid back.\n  What is happening is, the general fund of the United States is, in \neffect, borrowing money from the Social Security trust fund. It is \nusing that money to pay other bills--not using it to pay down debt, not \nusing it to prepay the liability, it is using it to pay other bills. It \nis adding to the debt. So last year the debt increased not by $319 \nbillion, which we read in every press report. You didn't read in any \npress report that I can find, not one, that the debt increased by $551 \nbillion last year.\n  When you then correct for what has been left out, instead of an \noperating deficit of 2.6 percent of GDP, which was reported in the \nstory by the Washington Post on Saturday, which is, they say, within \nacceptable bounds of most economists--most economists say about 2.5 \npercent of GDP is the danger point--when you make an adjustment for \nwhat the debt increased by, what you see is an operating hole in the \nUnited States of 4.5 percent of GDP, far beyond what most economists \nsay is acceptable. In fact, in the European Union, to become a member, \nyou have to have an operating deficit of 3 percent of GDP or less. The \nUnited States wouldn't qualify under that standard because in truth our \noperating deficit is now well in excess of 4 percent of GDP.\n  The other thing that is important to understand, the article \nreferenced the deficit as a share of GDP was higher back in the 1980s, \nnot much higher, and in most years not higher when you put in the \ncalculation of the money being taken from Social Security. Here is the \npattern of Social Security surpluses that are being used. You can see \nback in the 1980s there was almost no money being used from the Social \nSecurity trust fund. Back in those days, you can see we were running \nvery small surpluses. In fact, until 1983, we weren't running any \nsurpluses in Social Security. Then they were very modest, but most of \nthis time well below $50 billion. Look at where we are now. We are up \nhere now, $170 billion a year. That is a profound difference in the \ncalculation. Nobody seems to pay any attention to it. This gives you a \nvery different look at the true fiscal condition of the country.\n  In addition to that, back in the 1980s, you had time to get well \nbecause the baby boomers were not going to retire for over 20 years. \nNow there is no time to get well because the baby boomers are poised to \nretire. That is not a projection. The baby boomers are alive today. \nThey have been born. They are living. They are going to retire. They \nare going to be eligible for Social Security and Medicare. We are \nheaded for a train wreck.\n  What we get from the mainstream media are these happy talk reports \nthat the deficit is down. No attention is paid to the increase in the \ndebt. No attention is paid to where this is all headed. This is serious \nbusiness.\n  This chart shows, going back to 1980, the relationship between \nspending and revenue. The red line is the spending line as a percent of \nGDP in the United States. The green line is the revenue line as a \npercent of GDP. Let's stop there and ask, Why do we use that \ncalculation? Why aren't we showing in dollar terms the relationship \nbetween spending and revenue over a long period of time? The reason is \nvery simple: Economists tell us, if you use gross domestic product, you \nthen take out the effects of inflation and real growth, so you are \ncomparing apples to apples. That is what we are trying to do here, get \na sense of what is happening to our spending, what has happened to our \nrevenue over an extended period of time.\n  This chart shows that the spending level of the United States, back \nin the 1980s and for much of the 1990s, was significantly higher than \nit is today. You can see the spending line back here. This goes back to \n1980. Through the 1980s, the spending line--and much of the 1990s--was \nwell above where it is today, even though in the 1990s spending came \ndown each and every year as a share of gross domestic product. Now we \nhave had this uptick in spending, quite a substantial increase as a \nshare of gross domestic product, but still we are well below where \nspending was in the 1980s and for much of the 1990s.\n  Ninety-one percent of the increase in discretionary spending was from \nthree factors: Defense, homeland security, and rebuilding New York. So \nthe spending line has had a substantial increase but still well below \nwhere Federal spending was as a share of our national income going back \nto the 1980s and 1990s.\n  Look at the revenue line. The revenue line back in the 1980s was \napproaching 20 percent of GDP. Then there were the tax cuts, and it \nwent down to just over 17 percent of GDP. Then it kind of jiggled and \njagged around here. And then in the 1990s, as the spending line came \ndown each and every year, the revenue line went up each and every year. \nSo that in the year 2000, revenue was at a historic high, about 20.9 \npercent of GDP.\n\n  Look what has happened to the revenue line since 2000. The revenue \nline has collapsed. Revenue last year was the lowest as a share of \ngross domestic product since 1959. Anybody who is serious about doing \nsomething about the deficit has to address both the spending line and \nthe revenue line. Very often our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle only want to talk about the spending line. They vote for all the \nspending, but they don't want to address the revenue side of the \nequation. They don't want to cut the spending to meet the revenue line, \nand they don't want to raise the revenue to meet the spending line.\n  What we have here is a complete lack of responsibility. There are a \nlot of speeches about fiscal responsibility, but there is no reality of \nresponsibility. Our Republican friends want to focus on the spending \nside, and indeed we need to focus on the spending side, although they \nvoted for this increase in spending. These have not been Democratic \nbudgets. These are not Democratic spending bills. Our Republican \nfriends are in charge of the Senate and the House and the White House. \nThey are responsible for every dollar of increase in spending. Every \ndollar they voted for. But they don't want to be responsible to match \ntheir spending with revenue. They don't want to cut the spending to \nmatch the revenue line, and they sure don't want to raise the revenue \nto match the spending line. They are happy passing it off to our kids, \njust tack it on to the debt. They say they are fiscally responsible. \nNo. This is not fiscal responsibility.\n  What is most alarming is where all this heads. While it is true we \nhave had an uptick in revenue in the last year--very welcome--we see \nthat we are still way below the spending line. This is before the baby \nboomers retire.\n  Somebody may be listening and will say: Well, Senator Conrad is \ngiving a passionate speech to raise taxes. No, don't misunderstand me. \nI am giving a speech about making this all add up. We either have to \ncut the spending down to the revenue line or we have to raise the \nrevenue line to our spending appetite or some combination. That means \nwe either have to cut spending down to the revenue that we are willing \nto levy or we have to be willing to raise the revenue line or some \ncombination.\n  By the way, the first thing we ought to do on revenue is not a tax \nincrease on anybody. The first thing we ought to do is focus on the tax \ngap. That is the difference between what is owed and what is being \npaid. That tax gap now is over $350 billion a year. The fact is, the \nvast majority of Americans pay what they owe. But increasingly, \nindividuals and companies aren't paying what they owe. The Revenue \nService says that has now reached $350 billion a year, money that is \nowed that is not being paid. There has been precious little being done \nabout it.\n  The hard reality, what is so different from the 1980s and now, is \nthis demographic tsunami that is coming at us. This is a representation \nof the increase of people eligible for Social Security\n\n[[Page S11619]]\n\nand Medicare. We are under 40 million now eligible for Social Security \nand Medicare. We are headed for 81 million. It profoundly changes \neverything. The President's budget that claims it is going to reduce \nthe deficit over the next 5 years misses the point. The only way he \ngets to cutting the deficit in half is he leaves out some items--war \ncosts past September 30, the cost to fix the alternative minimum tax. A \n5-year budget hides the larger truth. The larger truth is the \nPresident's long-term plan makes this whole situation much worse. Why? \nBecause the President's tax cuts absolutely explode right beyond the 5-\nyear budget window.\n  We used to do 10-year budgets. Then the President changed to a 5-year \nbudget. I believe the key reason for that change was he knows what \nthese numbers show, just as I do. He and his people know exactly what \nis going to happen beyond the 5-year budget window. The cost of his tax \ncuts explode. This is going to happen. The 10-year cost of the \nPresident's tax cuts are $1.8 trillion. Here is what happens right \nbeyond--the dotted line is the end of the 5-year budget window. Here is \nwhat happens to the President's tax cut proposal right beyond the 5 \nyears. It explodes. It is not just that cost that explodes; it is also \nthe cost to fix the alternative minimum tax which, by the way, there is \nnot a penny in the President's budget to deal with. The alternative \nminimum tax, the old millionaire's tax, now is becoming very rapidly a \nmiddle class tax trap. Three million people were affected last year. It \nis going to be 30 million people affected 10 years from now, if we \ndon't do something.\n  It costs $774 billion to fix, and not a penny of it is in the \nPresident's budget. Again, the same pattern, right beyond the 5-year \nbudget window, this dotted line, the cost of fixing the alternative \nminimum tax skyrockets.\n  What is the answer that we get on the budget? We get what is called \nreconciliation, and we are told this is a deficit reduction plan. No, \nit is not. There is no deficit reduction in this plan.\n  This increases the deficit. Why? Because while it is true it has $35 \nbillion of spending cuts, it also has $70 billion of tax cuts. And so \nthe combined effect is to actually increase the deficit. What sense \ndoes this make when we have a debt crisis looming? The debt increased \n$551 billion last year. The forecasters are telling us it is going to \nincrease $600 billion this year--or more. And the answer is a \nreconciliation package cloaked as deficit reduction that actually \nincreases the deficit.\n  I don't know how anybody can, with a straight face, claim this is \nwhat the country needs.\n  This is the increase in the debt over the next 5 years of the \nPresident's budget plan. You take the President's budget plan. You \nadjust it for the war costs he has left out--not Kent Conrad's \nprojection of the war costs, the projection of the Congressional Budget \nOffice--you put in the cost to fix the alternative minimum tax and the \nPresident's budget policy, the debt of the country is going to go up \n$3.4 trillion over the next 5 years. And our colleagues are out here \ntalking about cutting spending $35 billion. It is farcical. It is \nfarcical.\n  They talk about fiscal responsibility. They are sending off a plan to \nincrease the debt $3 trillion, and they run out here with a plan to cut \n$35 billion of spending. And by the way, that is not deficit reduction \nbecause they are also going to cut taxes $70 billion, so they are \nactually going to make the deficit worse, in the face of $3 trillion of \nadditional debt before the baby boomers retire. Come on. This is what \nis happening to the debt under this plan--this budget plan that was \npassed in the Senate before Katrina. This is what it is going to do to \nthe debt. These are not Kent Conrad's numbers. This is what's going to \nhappen to the debt. It is going to go up $600 billion a year each and \nevery year for the next 5 years--more than $600 billion. It went up \n$550 billion last year. You talk about building a wall of debt--and all \nat the worst possible time before the baby boomers retire.\n  Now, the Comptroller General of the United States has come to us and \nsaid, You have an utterly unsustainable situation on your hands. You \nare running these massive deficits, huge explosion of debt before the \nbaby boomers retire and guess what. You have a shortfall in Medicare \nalone of $29.6 trillion. You have a Social Security shortfall that is \nprojected at $4 trillion. In those two alone, that is $33 trillion of \nunfunded liabilities.\n  Is anybody paying attention? Does anybody understand where this is \nall headed? This is a train wreck. That is where we are headed--a train \nwreck. And what is the answer? To come out here with a package that \nincreases the deficit some more? They have got to be kidding. They have \ngot to be kidding.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe this $4 trillion of shortfall in \nSocial Security. I think that is a very bad estimate. I think the \nshortfall in Social Security is much less. Why? Because the assumption \nbehind this projection is that the economy is only going to grow 1.9 \npercent a year for the next 75 years. Over the previous 75 years, the \neconomy grew at 3.4 percent a year. If the economy were to grow in the \nfuture as it has in the past, 80 percent of the Social Security \nshortfall would disappear. Eighty percent would disappear. If the \neconomy grows in the future as it has in the past, 80 percent of the \nSocial Security projected shortfall would disappear. So I think it is a \nvery pessimistic forecast.\n  On the other hand, the shortfall in Medicare that is seven times, \nmore than seven times the projected shortfall in Social Security, I \nthink that is, unfortunately, realistic because it is based on two \nbasic assumptions. No. 1, the retirement of the baby boom generation. \nAnd that is no projection. They have been born. They are alive today. \nThey are going to retire. They are going to be eligible. And No. 2, \nmedical inflation is running well ahead of the underlying rate of \ninflation, and all of us know that is true. So the Medicare shortfall \nis much more likely to come true than the Social Security shortfall. \nAnd the hard reality is we already can't pay our bills. The hard \nreality is we are already mushrooming the debt in a way that is utterly \nunsustainable. Senator, when you say the increase in the debt is \nunsustainable, what do you mean? Here is what I mean. Foreign holdings \nof our debt have gone up 104 percent in the last 4 years.\n  It took over 200 years of American history to run up an external debt \nof $1 trillion. In the last 4 years, we have managed to more than \ndouble it.\n  Is anybody listening? Is anybody paying attention? Is there anybody \nwho is writing these news columns who is connecting the dots? Is \nanybody paying attention to what is going on here with the fiscal \ncondition of the country? Does anybody care? And what do we get from \nthe mainstream media? Happy talk; the deficit went down. Debt went up, \nthe deficit went down.\n  Yes, it went down to the third biggest ever. And the size of the \ndeficit completely masks the true seriousness of our fiscal condition \nbecause it misses how much the debt increased. The debt increased by \n$551 billion. The result is--here it is--we are borrowing more and more \nfrom abroad--more than a 100-percent increase in the foreign holdings \nof our debt in 4 years.\n  Does anybody believe that is a sustainable course? I do not. And here \nit is. Here is the result. We owe Japan $684 billion. We owe China \nalmost $250 billion. We owe the United Kingdom over $170 billion. And \nhere is my favorite, the Caribbean Banking Centers--the Caribbean \nBanking Centers. We owe them over $100 billion. Where do they get their \nmoney? We owe them over $100 billion. We owe South Korea almost $60 \nbillion.\n  Mr. President, it is an utterly unsustainable course. The Comptroller \nGeneral of the United States has told us it is unsustainable. The head \nof the Congressional Budget Office has told us it is unsustainable. \nAlan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has told us it is \nunsustainable. We are building up massive debt before the baby boomers \nretire, and the mainstream media run their stories saying the deficits \nhave improved.\n  There is no attention to what has happened to debt, no attention to \nthe train wreck that is coming. It is really a disconnection from \nreality that does not serve our country well. The American people \ndeserve better. The American people deserve to be told honestly how \ndeep this ditch is and how much it is going to take to fill it in \nbecause we cannot continue to run around the\n\n[[Page S11620]]\n\nworld with a tin cup asking more and more countries to loan us more and \nmore money. To have foreign countries increase their holdings of our \ndebt by over 100 percent in 4 years is utterly unsustainable. It is \nreckless and it is wrong. It has to be stopped. To have our colleagues \ncome out on this floor with a reconciliation package that makes it all \nworse is profoundly irresponsible, profoundly.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Durbin are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, are we under a time limit right now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The debate will begin at 2 o'clock on the Reed \namendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am going to speak on the Reed amendment, \nand I ask to be recognized to speak at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2077\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \namendment offered by Senators Collins and Reed to add $3.1 billion in \nemergency funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. I \nemphasize this is, indeed, emergency funding, not to come out of \nsomething else but emergency funding because it really is a crisis.\n  During the cold winter months, LIHEAP is indispensable for low-income \nfamilies, people with disabilities, and seniors on fixed incomes. Last \nFriday, I held a roundtable discussion in Hiawatha, IA, to hear \nfirsthand from some of these citizens. They are not just concerned \nabout high home heating costs this winter, they are right now almost in \na state of panic. They told me they face a choice between staying warm \nand cutting back on necessities, such as medical care and prescription \ndrugs.\n  Their testimony is backed up by hard data. According to a statewide \nIowa survey, more than 20 percent of households receiving LIHEAP report \ngoing without medical care or prescription drugs. More than 10 percent \nreported going without food in order to pay their heating bills, and \nthose numbers are going to skyrocket this winter.\n  Last winter, about 86,000 Iowa households received an average of $317 \nin LIHEAP assistance. Most years, everyone who applies gets some level \nof assistance, but this year we are headed for big problems. As I \nlearned in Hiawatha, the applications for home heating assistance have \njumped by 50 to 70 percent this year. The director of the local \nCommunity Assistance Program that administers LIHEAP in that part of \nIowa told me that LIHEAP funds are likely to be exhausted by mid-\nJanuary, right in the dead of winter. Community services agencies all \nacross America are being deluged with calls from panicked senior \ncitizens and others who don't know how they are going to pay their \nbills or heating bills. Many have had their utilities cut off and \ncannot make past-due payments to get them turned back on. Others are \nbeing threatened with cutoffs just as we head into winter. This is \nsomething I learned in Hiawatha, but not too many people here know. The \nCatch-22 situation is this: If your gas or electricity has been cut \noff, then you do not qualify for LIHEAP. Let's say you are someone who \nhas a past bill that you have not paid; they say, We are not going to \ndeliver your home heating oil, you cannot qualify for LIHEAP.\n  So we are facing a real crisis. We know what the price of fuel oil \nhas done and what the price of natural gas has done. In Iowa, I heard \nthat heating oil has doubled since last year, and natural gas has gone \nup by almost 50 percent. It will not be unusual to have a $400 or $500 \nincrease in an average heating bill this winter. For an elderly person, \na low-income family, and people with disabilities, that is not a \nproblem, it is a catastrophe. It boggles my mind that in the face of \nthis overwhelming need, President Bush's budget proposed to cut LIHEAP \nfunding by nearly 10 percent.\n  We have been given abundant warning that local LIHEAP funding will be \nrunning out, as I said, as early as the middle of January. But earlier \nthis month, we voted down an amendment to provide a boost in emergency \nfunding. Last week, a reporter asked the Secretary of Energy, Mr. \nBodman, if the administration plans to ask Congress for more funding \nfor LIHEAP, given the big runup in energy costs. Secretary Bodman \nanswered:\n\n       At least at this point in time, that's not on the agenda.\n\n  LIHEAP may not be on Secretary Bodman's agenda, and it may not be on \nthe President's agenda, but it is on the Senate's agenda. We have an \nobligation to do the right thing, to make sure our senior citizens and \nthose with disabilities are not left out in the cold.\n  Again, we have to do the right thing. We have to do what is fair. We \nknow what has happened to the price of heating oil and natural gas and \nelectricity. We know from the past how many people use LIHEAP and \ndepend on it. It does not take a genius to calculate that we have to \ncome up with more money this year or people are going to get cut off. \nWhat are we going to do? Are we going to wait until January when all of \na sudden we get reports about people being cut off? And we will not \neven be here; we will be out of session. I suppose we will come back \nthe third week of January.\n  We can do better than this. We have to do better. America can do \nbetter than this. We are a better people than that. We need to support \nthis amendment to provide this emergency funding so those who need the \nhelp the most are not left out in the cold. People are concerned. They \nare worried. They don't know what they are going to do. The least we \ncan do today is say: Don't worry, we are going to put the money in for \nLIHEAP; you are going to be able to buy your gas, pay your electricity \nbills, and stay warm this winter.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 30 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the Reed amendment.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa for his \neloquent and, to me, very persuasive remarks about the need for \nsupporting this amendment. This is something we know is going to \nhappen. Everyone understands energy prices are soaring out of sight. \nLast year, we did not have sufficient resources for LIHEAP with prices \nthat were much cheaper. This year we know we are not going to have \nsufficient resources.\n  So we have come together on a bipartisan basis. Senator Collins, \nSenator Snowe, Senator Smith, Senator Coleman--many of my Democratic \ncolleagues have come together to do what should be obvious to all of \nus: raise the level of LIHEAP funding to accommodate these huge \nincreases in prices. It is very simple, I think--I hope.\n  I hope we are in a process of beginning to understand all of the \ndemands that are being placed on low-income Americans, and particularly \nseniors. They received the Social Security increase of about $65 a \nmonth. Most of that was taken up automatically by increased payments to \ntheir Medicare Program, and whatever little is left is going to be \nswallowed up by these rising energy prices.\n  The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program needs $5.1 billion just \nto maintain the status quo. The appropriation to date, what the \nPresident supports, is $2 billion. Now, $2 billion was inadequate last \nyear; it is grossly inadequate this year.\n  I understand our colleague, the Senator from Missouri, has indicated \nin terms of concept of the program he supports it, and I appreciate \nthose remarks. We might have a debate about whether this is the \nappropriate vehicle to place this amendment, but, frankly, time is \nrunning out; floor time is running out, and unless we are able to \nappropriate these funds immediately, we are going to have a real issue \nof getting\n\n[[Page S11621]]\n\nthem to deserving people throughout this country.\n  Last winter Congress provided $2.2 billion. Again this year they have \nalready cut that in the budget to $2 billion. That is the \nadministration's request. It was insufficient last year. In Rhode \nIsland, 12,146 households, including the elderly, received utility \ntermination notices. The average balance of those who were disconnected \nwas over $1,000.\n  Today, my State and other States are struggling to get these people \nreconnected using LIHEAP funds to get them back on the utility grid. \nThat is even before we have had the first cold days of winter.\n  A Rhode Islander receiving $400 from LIHEAP last year could buy \napproximately 235 gallons of heating oil, almost a full tank, but at \n$2.60 a gallon, which is the price that is being paid today--in fact, \nin many cases that is a pretty good price; in fact, it is much higher--\n$400 will only buy 150 gallons of oil. That is a little over half a \ntank and may last in a very cold New England winter about 2\\1/2\\ weeks.\n  This year, with even higher energy prices facing Americans and more \nAmericans living in poverty, the administration and the House have \nsimply come forward with $2 billion. It is absolutely inadequate. We \nknow it. We have an opportunity today to make it so that at least it \nwill buy as much this year as it did last winter.\n  The average price for heating oil is $2.65 per gallon. That is 65 \ncents higher than it was last year this time. The average price of \npropane is $1.95 per gallon. That is 32 cents higher than last year. \nThe average price for natural gas is $15.25 per million cubic feet. \nThat is $2.32 higher than last year.\n  What we have seen consistently, what we all recognize, what we see \nevery day when we pass the gasoline station, is extraordinarily high \nenergy prices. How can we reasonably fund this program with less \ndollars than we did last year with these soaring prices? We are just \ntrying to maintain what we have.\n  Frankly, last year a significant number of households that would \nqualify because of income could not receive assistance because those \nfunds were insufficient.\n  I believe we have to increase the LIHEAP funding to its fully \nauthorized level of $5.1 billion. This bipartisan amendment would do \nthat by increasing the appropriation by the sum of $3.1 billion. I hope \nmy colleagues will join us and support this amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Who yields time?\n  The time will be deducted equally from each side.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \nReed amendment for the purposes of my offering an amendment, and I will \nspeak for about 6 or 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, who would that time be charged to?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That time will be charged to the majority \nside.\n  Mr. REED. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2160\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am going to offer an amendment to this \nbill regarding the report of the independent counsel on Mr. Cisneros. I \nknow there has been much talk about the need to bring to a close the \nindependent counsel's work, and I agree.\n  I tell my colleagues, as a radio announcer would say, about the rest \nof the story. The independent counsel completed his investigative \nactivities February 2003. The counsel completed and filed his report \nunder seal to the Special Division August 2004. That is very important \nfor every one of us to understand as we consider this amendment. The \ninvestigative work is completed. The report is completed.\n  So what is the holdup in getting this report out to the Congress and \nto the public? It is not the independent counsel; rather it is the \nlawyers of the individuals named in the report who have been engaged in \none sole pursuit: to foot-drag every inch of the way filing every \nmotion they can to delay, delay, delay. This foot-dragging by the \nlawyers has been going on for months. It is because of this foot-\ndragging that the independent counsel has had to continue its work. It \nhas to respond to the mountains of pleas and motions that are filed by \nthese lawyers.\n  I would like to make another point, and that is that the amendment \ndoes two things: It provides that the report will be released and \npublished in 60 days, and by extension that the independent counsel \nwill close up and wind down his office within 90 days of publication of \nthe report and can only be extended by a finding of the court and the \npublication by that court of an exact time of when it will be shut \ndown.\n  In addition, under my amendment it makes it clear that the \nindependent counsel shall not perform any investigative or \nprosecutorial task in the remaining time period after the report is \npublished.\n  I have had some discussions with my friend, Senator Dorgan from North \nDakota, on this subject on the side as I was preparing this amendment, \nand he has also spoken very eloquently on this subject in a previous \nday's debate a few weeks back. I want him to know I agree with the \nconcerns that he has that we must see the end of the independent \ncounsel.\n  My first amendment reflected the same sentiment for closing the \noffice once the report is published. But, unfortunately, as I was \nlooking into the matter more closely, it is not straightforward to just \nshut down the independent counsel's office. The independent counsel, \nafter publication, needs a short period of time to evaluate claims for \nattorney's fees, transfer records to the archivist, respond to \ncongressional inquiries and possible litigation.\n  My hope, and I believe the hope of the independent counsel, is that \nbarring the unforeseen, this all can be accomplished within the 90 days \nI have within my amendment.\n  So I want to assure my friend from North Dakota I share his concerns \nabout runaway and unnecessary spending, and would join him in watching \nthis matter closely and will be with him if we are not moving forward \nat a reasonable pace to bring this operation to an end.\n  Setting aside the matter of closure, I want to focus on one last \npoint: The contents of this report and why they are so vital. I hope I \nhave a good reputation among my colleagues for doing the constitutional \njob of oversight that each one of us has been assigned, to make sure \nthat the laws are faithfully executed. I hope I have a reputation of \ndoing oversight work regardless of what political party might be in \ncharge of the executive branch of Government.\n  While Mr. Cisneros' name is there, and it is natural to see this \nthrough a partisan lens, let me assure my colleagues that is not the \ncase. The media reports are giving very credible commentary that the \nindependent counsel's report discusses problems at the Office of \nCriminal Investigation in the Internal Revenue Service and the \nDepartment of Justice. These matters do not involve Mr. Cisneros but \nraise extremely important questions about the administration of the Tax \nCode.\n  As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I take with great \nseriousness accusations of inappropriate activity at the Internal \nRevenue Service, and also as a senior member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, similar accusations at the Department of Justice. However, \nas my colleagues know, I cannot legislate or conduct oversight based on \nwhispers or rumors. I need the final report. The American taxpayers \nhave a lot of money in this report. We are talking about millions of \ndollars. They deserve a right to see this investigation and what their \ntax money was spent for. More importantly, they deserve for there to be \nsunshine exposing problems in our Government and for legislators to be \ninformed so that we can take appropriate action, in my case, within the \nSenate Finance Committee that I chair, or within the Judiciary \nCommittee on which I serve.\n  In conclusion, this is a vitally important amendment. It will give \nCongress a report that will provide tremendous insight into problems in \nthe administration of the Tax Code and other governmental misconduct. \nThe amendment will also bring closure to the work of the independent \ncounsel, a\n\n[[Page S11622]]\n\nmatter of concern to many and expressed eloquently, as I have said \nbefore, by the Senator from North Dakota. I think we provide a \nreasonable timeframe of 90 days after the report is published to wind \ndown this office, with only the court allowed to continue the \noffice. Further, the amendment also limits the work of the independent \ncounsel to the clerical work of closing the office. My amendment, then, \nprohibits those things that tend to make things go on and on and never \nstop--investigations and prosecution.\n\n  This may not be a perfect solution to getting this report out that \nhas cost millions of dollars, but it is a fair compromise and one that \nI think will get the job done. Ideally, the report would just be \nreleased, but there are people who maybe do not want this report \nreleased--consequently all the legal action that has been holding it up \nfor the last several--now, let's say at least 14 months.\n  I send the amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2160.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 356, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n       Sec. 408.(a) The division of the court shall release to the \n     Congress and to the public not later than 60 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act all portions of the final \n     report of the independent counsel of the investigation of \n     Henry Cisneros made under section 594(h) of title 28, United \n     States Code, except for any such portions that contain \n     information of a personal nature that the division of the \n     court determines the disclosure of which would cause a \n     clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy that outweighs the \n     public interest in a full accounting of this investigation. \n     Upon the release of the final report, the final report shall \n     be published pursuant to section 594(h)(3) of title 28, \n     United States Code.\n       (b)(1) After the release and publication of the final \n     report referred to in subsection (a), the independent counsel \n     shall continue his office only to the extent necessary and \n     appropriate to perform the noninvestigative and \n     nonprosecutorial tasks remaining of his statutory duties as \n     required to conclude the functions of his office.\n       (2) The duties referred to in paragraph (1) shall \n     specifically include--\n       (A) the evaluation of claims for attorney fees, pursuant to \n     section 593(l) of title 28, United States Code;\n       (B) the transfer of records to the Archivist of the United \n     States pursuant to section 594(k) of title 28, United States \n     Code;\n       (C) compliance with oversight obligations pursuant to \n     section 595(a) of title 28, United States Code; and\n       (D) preparation of statements of expenditures pursuant to \n     section 595(c) of title 28, United States Code.\n       (c)(1) The independent counsel shall have not more than 90 \n     days after the release and publication of the final report \n     referred to in subsection (a) to complete his remaining \n     statutory duties unless the division of the court determines \n     that it is necessary for the independent counsel to have \n     additional time to complete his remaining statutory duties.\n       (2) If the division of the court finds that the independent \n     counsel needs additional time under paragraph (1), the \n     division of the court shall issue a public report stating the \n     grounds for the extension and a proposed date for completion \n     of all aspects of the investigation of Henry Cisneros and \n     termination of the office of the independent counsel.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask the time be charged to each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask how much remains of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I will make a few additional comments in the \nremaining time with respect to the LIHEAP program and this legislation.\n  This is a very simple amendment. It adds $3.1 billion. It would bring \nit up to the level that was authorized in the Energy bill which we \nconsidered on this floor several weeks ago, recognizing the \nauthorization levels had to be raised given the increase in prices, \ngiven the need for more Americans to access the LIHEAP program.\n  The energy costs to the average family using heating oil this winter \nare estimated to hit about $1,500, and that is a significant increase, \nabout $400 over last year. Natural gas could hit over $1,000, an \nincrease of $350. Propane prices are projected to hit $1,400 for the \naverage prices for the whole year of heating, an increase of about \n$325.\n  This is particularly burdensome for low-income families and families \nin poverty. In fact, families who live in poverty spend over 20 percent \nof their income on heat. That is in contrast to other families, middle- \nand upper-income families who spend about 5 percent during a heating \nseason. So this is a huge impact, in fact, a more aggravated impact, on \nlow-income Americans.\n  Frankly, the choice for many seniors is very stark: to heat or to \neat. A RAND study pointed out that low-income households reduce their \nfood expenditures by roughly the same amount as their increases in fuel \nexpenditures. They cut back on eating to heat their homes. It doesn't \ntake a RAND study to suggest why that is the case. It is hard for a \nsenior or for anyone who lives in a home where the temperature is 50 or \n45 degrees. You can put on sweaters and extra blankets but at some \npoint you have to keep the energy flowing as best you can. They will, \nin fact, as the studies indicate, avoid eating to heat their homes.\n  Our LIHEAP program in Rhode Island, as so many programs across the \ncountry, is under tremendous stress and strain. Last year they served \n26,000 families, but if the President's proposal goes through with $2 \nbillion, they will only be able to service about 21,000 families. So \n5,000 families will not get anything; 21,000 families lucky enough to \nqualify will receive resources, but it will be not as adequate as it \nwas last year to buy heating oil, particularly because the price has \ngone up so much. So it is again a situation I find difficult to \nunderstand, why we cannot summon the will to do something which is so \nobviously necessary.\n  This is no innovative program. This is no controversial program. I \ndare say everyone on this floor would say it is a good program, it \nmakes sense, it helps people who need help, particularly at a time when \nprices are surging as they are. Yet I hope we can come together and \nrecognize we need something more than words. We actually need the \nappropriations to help keep these people whole, keep them, literally, \nwarm this winter.\n  We have all been out to our communities. We have all visited with \nseniors. I visited with a senior from Rhode Island, a veteran of the \nU.S. military who is 88 years old--part of that great generation of \nWorld War II. He receives LIHEAP support. Frankly, this year even if he \nreceives the same amount of money, it will not buy the same amount of \nfuel oil and it will be colder in his home. As has been said so often \non this floor, and it has to be repeated, we can do much better. We \ncould do much better for an 88-year-old veteran of the U.S. military \nforces who last year got a little help and this year will get less \nhelp. We can do better and we should do better.\n  We need to fully fund LIHEAP up to the authorized level of $5.1 \nbillion. I think we have to do more, going forward on other energy \nprojects. But let's at least begin with adequately funding the LIHEAP \nProgram.\n  I hope my colleagues will join my cosponsors, Senator Collins, \nSenator Snowe, Senator Smith, Senator Coleman on the Republican side, \nand many others on the Democratic side to ensure that this amendment is \npassed and we can at least guarantee minimum warmth for our seniors and \nlow-income families across this country.\n  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. I ask unanimous \nconsent the time be divided equally between both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S11623]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I understand that the Senator from Missouri \nmade a motion under the Congressional Budget Act 1974. I move to waive \nthe applicable sections of the act, for the consideration of the \npending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to waive section 402(b)(5) \nof the House Concurrent Resolution No. 95 with respect to the Reed \namendment No. 2077.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Corzine) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 53, nays 46, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 261 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--53\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--46\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Carper\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Corzine\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I formally raise a point of order that the \namendment violates section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained. The amendment \nfalls.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I would inquire if the Senator from North \nDakota is prepared to move forward with his amendment?\n  Seeing no other Senators seeking recognition, I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant \nlegislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2133\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I take the floor to withdraw an amendment, \nbut I will not withdraw it for the moment. I will say a few words and \nthen ask that the amendment be withdrawn. I do not need consent to do \nthat as sponsor of the amendment because the yeas and nays have not yet \nbeen ordered.\n  If there were a high school or college student listening, I think it \nwould be a good lesson for them, particularly if they are interested in \npolitical science, to understand where we are at this moment from a \nparliamentary standpoint and why I am withdrawing the amendment I \noffered yesterday.\n  Incidentally, this will not be the last my colleagues see of this \namendment. We have had it on the floor before. It has been passed by \nthe Senate before, as a matter of fact, dropped in conference. We will \nnot have an opportunity to vote on it now because of the parliamentary \ncircumstances.\n  So let me describe what it is. First of all, the amendment is germane \nand relevant to this appropriations bill. I have the right and did \noffer an amendment yesterday that prohibits the expenditure of funds in \nthis appropriations bill by an organization called OFAC, the Office of \nForeign Assets Control, which is a relatively small Federal office deep \nin the bowels of the catacombs of the Treasury Department. The job of \nthe Office of Foreign Assets Control is to try to track down and \nintercept the money that supports terrorism, to go find the money that \nsupports Osama bin Laden, to go find the money that supports terrorism.\n  Well, the Office of Foreign Assets Control does more than that now. \nIn fact, my understanding is they have more people in the Office of \nForeign Assets Control tracking Americans who travel to Cuba to take a \nvacation than they do tracking the money that goes to support terrorism \nfor Osama bin Laden's network.\n  So let me describe what they do because, as you know, in this \ncountry's zeal to punish Fidel Castro--we are going to slap around \nFidel Castro; we don't like him; it is a communist country; he is a \ncommunist leader; we don't like him; he sticks his finger in our eye \nrepeatedly--we have slapped an embargo for 40 years on Cuba. We also \ndecided if American people travel to Cuba, they shall be fined. So we \nhave restricted the freedom of the American people to travel in order \nto slap around Fidel Castro.\n  If you get on a plane today someplace and travel to Cuba, and you do \nnot have a license, here is what is going to happen to you. By the way, \nyou won't be able to get a license because they are offered down at the \nOffice of Foreign Asset Control and over at the State Department, and \nif you apply for a license to travel to Cuba, they will say no.\n  But I will give you an example. Kurt Foster went to Cuba. He was \nunder suspicion of having taken a vacation in Cuba. And be darned if he \ndidn't take a vacation in Cuba. He didn't know it was illegal. But he \ngot back to this country and, boy, they tracked him down.\n  Those folks at the Office of Foreign Assets Control, they have that \nmagnifying glass and the cap with brims on both sides, and they scour \naround to figure out if there is an American who has gone to Cuba.\n  They found this guy, Kurt Foster. All right. He purchased an airline \nticket to Cuba and failed to declare Cuba as a country visited, and \nthey fined him $7,500. Then he used a credit card while in Cuba, and \nthey fined him $1,000. Then he paid for lodging, food, and drinks while \nin Cuba--he spent $175 there--and they fined him $10,000 for that. Then \nhe brought back a box of cigars and 27 other Cuban goods at $10 each, \nand that was a $520 fine.\n  So Mr. Kurt Foster was fined $19,020 by our U.S. Government. Why? \nWhat was the transgression? He visited Cuba. God forbid this man should \nvisit Cuba. But Kurt Foster, that is a man without a face.\n  Let me just put a face on this issue, as I did yesterday. This is a \npicture of Joni Scott. I met Joni Scott. She came to my office. She is \na wonderful young woman, a missionary, someone with great zeal in her \nfaith.\n  She went to Cuba to distribute free Bibles on the streets of Havana, \nCuba. This wonderful young American woman wanted to distribute free \nBibles in Cuba. She did not know you had to have a license. She came \nback. Our Government tracked her down. They are going to slap a big \nfine on her for distributing free Bibles in Cuba. That is Joni Scott.\n  Here is Mrs. Slote. I have also met Mrs. Slote. As you can see, she \nis about 76, 77 years old in this picture. She is a senior Olympian. \nShe is wearing a bicycling outfit because she likes to bicycle. Joan \nSlote actually answered an advertisement in a Canadian cycling \nmagazine. So she joined a Canadian cycling group on a tour of Cuba on \nbicycles. She didn't know it was illegal for an American to travel to \nCuba. She came back. Her son had brain cancer, was dying, and she was \nattending to her son.\n\n[[Page S11624]]\n\n  In the meantime, our sleuths down at the Treasury Department tracked \nher down. They were going to slap a $10,000 fine on her, but she didn't \nget it because she was not home. She was attending to her son who was \ndying of brain cancer.\n  So then, the next effort by the U.S. Government was to attach her \nSocial Security. They were going to take her Social Security away. Why? \nBecause she bicycled in Cuba.\n  These folks in this picture are disabled marathoners, folks in \nwheelchairs, folks with lost limbs. They are people with the kind of \nspirit that is in the Special Olympics, who are disabled marathoners. \nTheir big deal was going to be done in Havana, Cuba, the international \nevent. They raised the money. They trained. They looked forward, with \ngreat hope, to go to this international event. Guess what. This country \ndenied the opportunity for them to travel to their international event. \nWhy? Because it was in Cuba.\n  I have no brief for the Castro government. That is not my purpose.\n  This man, as shown in this picture, by the way, is a Cuban. He came \nto this country legally. He is an American citizen. He joined the \nMarines. He went to Iraq and is a hero. This man has a Bronze Star for \nserving this country. Both his sons are still in Cuba. One of them was \ndesperately ill. He came back from fighting in Iraq, where he earned a \nBronze Star because of his heroism. Then he wanted to visit his sick \nson in Cuba, and his Government said: You don't have the freedom to do \nthat. You can't see your son.\n  That is what his Government said. You fought for freedom in Iraq, but \nyou don't have the freedom here to travel to Cuba to see your son.\n  I offered a bipartisan amendment yesterday for myself, Senators \nCraig, Baucus, and Enzi, two Democrats, two Republicans. That amendment \nhas passed the Senate previously. The amendment simply said: No funds \nmay be used in this appropriations bill to enforce the travel \nlimitations on the American people traveling to Cuba. Once again, what \nwe have done is, we have decided to restrict the freedom of the \nAmerican people in order to slap around Fidel Castro--not much of a \nbargain in a democracy.\n  Senator Murray is from the State of Washington. I know a man from the \nState of Washington who, after his father was cremated, took his \nfather's ashes to Cuba because his father wanted his ashes dispersed on \nthe grass in the church where he had ministered in Cuba before coming \nto this country. When his father died, his compliant son did what he \nwas requested to do. He went to Cuba to distribute his father's ashes.\n  Our Government--God bless those folks in OFAC with those tiny little \nglasses and that magnifying glass tracking American citizens--tracked \nhim down and levied a fine for taking his father's ashes to Cuba.\n  Now I offer the amendment. The Senate has previously agreed to the \namendment. Sufficient votes exist in the Senate to agree to the \namendment. Yesterday a colleague, following the rules of the Senate, \ncame and offered a second-degree amendment. What is the second-degree? \nIt is about abortion. So the reason I say this is an interesting lesson \nfor people involved in political science is, we now have an amendment \nthat deals with the issue of the freedom of the American people to \ntravel to Cuba second-degreed with an amendment dealing with abortion.\n  My colleague Senator Ensign offered this second-degree amendment, the \nChild Custody Protection Act, related to the transportation of minors \nand circumvention of certain laws relating to abortion. It is an \ninteresting lesson in how our system works around here.\n  We will offer this again. One of my colleagues was intending to offer \na second-degree so we wouldn't have this mischief, but that second-\ndegree didn't get offered. So the result is, another colleague comes \nover and offers an abortion amendment on a very simple, germane, and \nrelevant amendment dealing with the subject of travel to Cuba.\n  One of the things that makes the American people a little less than \necstatic about the way we work here is things that ought not use any \nbrainpower at all, such as deciding to penalize Americans, taking away \nthe freedom of the American people to travel because we don't like the \nCuban government. We don't do that with China. China is a communist \ngovernment. We say the best way to move people toward better human \nrights and democracy is through trade and travel. So we encourage \npeople to go to China. Vietnam is a Communist country. We do the same--\nengagement, trade, and travel. But we say with respect to Cuba, what we \nhave to do is restrict the freedom of the American people. That is \nunbelievably ignorant as a public policy.\n  We will change it one day, and there are sufficient votes in the \nSenate to change it. But because there is now a second-degree amendment \ndealing with abortion attached to the amendment, I will withdraw the \namendment this afternoon and simply tell my colleague who offered this \nthat he will have delayed this a bit. But inevitably, I and my \ncolleagues will come to the floor. We will have a sufficient \nopportunity to prohibit this kind of legitimate but certainly strange \nmischief with a second-degree amendment on abortion attached to a Cuba \ntravel amendment. It is going to happen. We are going to vote on this \nand we will, as we have in the past, vote to eliminate the restriction \nof the American people's right to travel.\n  I know why this is happening. This is all about politics. It is about \npolitics in Florida and politics in New Jersey and perhaps a couple \nother areas, but mostly Florida and New Jersey. It is reaching out to \nthose people who block the vote because the tougher you sound on Cuba, \nthe better for them. So the President, about 3 years ago, decided to \ntighten it up even further, shut it down. Family vacations, family \nopportunities to interact, to send money home, he has tightened it all \ndown.\n  Incidentally, there is an amendment that was passed that is now law \noffered by myself and then-Senator John Ashcroft. Talk about odd \nfellows; Senator Ashcroft and I together offered an amendment that \nbecame law that finally opened up a bit the ability of our country to \nsell food into Cuba. We had been unable to even move food into Cuba. \nSenator Ashcroft and I offered the amendment. It is now law. We can do \nthat. The administration is now trying to shut that down. I fixed that \nin this subcommittee at the subcommittee level. I have a provision in \nthis bill that shuts down the administration's opportunity to play \nmischief with the opportunity for our farmers to sell food into Cuba. \nIt is immoral to use food as a weapon. We know that. This isn't rocket \nscience.\n  I wanted to explain as I withdraw this amendment for the moment why I \nam forced to withdraw it: because the majority slaps an abortion \namendment on an amendment dealing with the American people's right to \ntravel. It is unbelievable. It is within the rules, but still \nunbelievable.\n  Those who have gained a few days respite on this will not apparently \nhave to vote today when I withdraw the amendment, but they will vote. \nWhen they vote, the Senate will approve the underlying amendment that \nI, Senator Craig, Senator Enzi, and Senator Baucus have offered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 2133, Withdrawn\n\n  With that, I withdraw the amendment No. 2133.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have offered a second-degree amendment \nthat deals with a subject that has been on everyone's mind. It has been \nin every newspaper in the country. It is about almost $500 million for \nbridges in the State of Alaska that, although they may be needed, are \npriorities, as we have discussed today, that are very low on the totem \npole in terms of the needs of the country.\n  I would also state, as I have earlier today, that we find ourselves \nin a significant difficulty as a nation. We had the worst natural \ndisaster to hit our country we have ever experienced. We are in a war. \nWe added $600 billion to our national debt this last year. That is not \nour national debt. That is our children's and our grandchildren's \nnational debt. That is over $2,000 per man, woman, and child. In this \ncountry this year we added to what they are going to have to pay back, \ncompounded at 6 percent over the next 30 years, $30,000 to $40,000.\n  I think it is important for us to look back at history a little bit \nto help us get redirected in terms of our priorities. There was a \nPresident who faced tremendous difficulties in our Nation. His name was \nFranklin Delano Roosevelt. He made a lot of great decisions for our \ncountry--enabled us to win World War II through his leadership. But \nless well known is FDR's decision to slash nondefense spending by over \n40 percent between 1942 and 1944. Among the programs that were \neliminated entirely were FDR's own prized creations. By 1944, such \npillars of the New Deal as the Civilian Conservation Corps, the \nNational Youth Administration, and the Work Projects Administration had \nbeen abolished. In 1939, those three programs had represented one-\neighth of the Federal budget. Roosevelt and the Congress of his day \nknew what to do in an emergency. Indeed, he chose to begin the \nreordering of budget priorities long before Pearl Harbor.\n  In October 1939, 1 month after Hitler invaded Poland, Roosevelt wrote \nHarold Smith, his budget director, ordering him to hold budgets for all \nGovernment programs at the present level and below if at all possible. \nThe next month he told him the administration would not undertake any \nnew projects, even laudable ones. He told reporters that the next year \nhis policy would be to cut nonmilitary programs to the bone. He kept \nhis word. Between 1939 and 1942 spending for nondefense programs was \ncut by 22 percent. Everyone realized that no matter how popular or \ndeeply entrenched the program, the Nation's priorities had to change.\n  I believe we find ourselves as a nation at that point in time again. \nWith the catastrophe we have seen to our gulf coast, with the war in \nIraq, with the energy crisis, and with the budget deficit, it is time \nfor us to change our priorities.\n  The second-degree amendment does not save the amount of money I \nwanted it to save, but it does save $75 million, and it takes that $75 \nmillion and sends it to the Lake Pontchartrain Bridge. It eliminates \ntwo bridges that should be very low priority in terms of the \ninfrastructure of this country. All the money that is not taken from \nthose bridges can be reprogrammed, portions of it can be reprogrammed \nto the State of Alaska for things they and their elected \nrepresentatives would deem might be more important.\n  I think it is important also to know what the people of Alaska think. \nI ask unanimous consent to submit for the Record quotes from letters to \nthe editor and editorial opinions from the major newspaper in Alaska on \nthe status of these two bridges.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Letters to the Editor from Alaskans--Alaskans Call to Give Bridges \n                       Money to Hurricane Victims\n\n       ``Thinking about the immense disaster in the Gulf states, \n     it occurred to me that the most effective thing that \n     Ketchikan residents could do to help would be to return the \n     money earmarked for our Gravina Bridge.''--Dave Person, \n     Ketchikan, Stories in the News, Sept. 3, 2005.\n       ``We must all seriously demand that our Alaska \n     congressional delegation take immediate steps to recall and \n     to redistribute the millions of dollars now earmarked for \n     non-essential and highly questionable and controversial new \n     Alaska bridges, which include a Lynn Canal road.''--Alan \n     Munro, Juneau, Juneau Empire Letters, Sept. 7, 2005.\n       There is no free federal money; what we Alaskans get is \n     money that some other state--and its people--don't get.

Owe Hurricane Survivors an Apology\n\n       As Alaskans view from afar the physical destruction and \n     social devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina, we should be \n     mindful of the distorted priorities promoted by Rep. Don \n     Young and Sen. Ted Stevens. While they pork-barreled hundreds \n     of millions of dollars to build boondoggle bridges in \n     Anchorage and Ketchikan to benefit their friends and \n     political contributors, they and their partners in the Bush \n     administration repeatedly cut the funds requested by the Army \n     Corps of Engineers, Federal Emergency Management Agency and \n     state and local governments for projects that could have \n     prevented the New Orleans disaster.\n       Sen. Stevens and Congressman Young should be ashamed of \n     their greed and corruption that has harmed so many and \n     brought disgrace on our nation. Our entire congressional \n     delegation has also argued on behalf of their energy-industry \n     friends against overwhelming scientific evidence of the \n     human-caused global warming that is exacerbating the \n     destructiveness of storms and destroying our fragile Alaska \n     ecosystems.\n       Alaskans owe an apology to the people of New Orleans, to \n     Alaska Native people and to the nation for their selfish \n     shortsightedness in sending these scoundrels to Washington \n     and voting to keep them there.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              Let's Donate a Bridge to Victims of Katrina\n\n                                                September 3, 2005.\n       Thinking about the immense disaster in the Gulf states, it \n     occurred to me that the most effective thing that Ketchikan \n     residents could do to help would be to return the money \n     earmarked for our Gravina bridge. I would assume that most \n     Ketchikan residents would agree that thousands of suffering \n     fellow citizens and billions of dollars of destroyed economic \n     and social infrastructure are of higher priority than our \n     ability to drive to the airport.\n                                                      Dave Person,\n     Ketchikan, AK--USA.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the Anchorage Daily News, Sept. 13, 2005]\n\n Just Say No to Pork, Alaska--Vote Ted Stevens, His Pals Out of Office\n\n       If we are to control federal spending, we must get a handle \n     on local, parochial interests. People keep telling me that \n     Alaska is a very conservative place as far as fiscal issues \n     go. Well, to me that means keeping governmental spending \n     under control.\n       Do your part, Alaska, and vote Ted Stevens and his pigsty \n     of friends out, and say no to pork. Quit being selfish and \n     expecting your politicians to bring home the bacon.\n                                                       Joe Hardin.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I will quote a few of those, if I might. The first is \nfrom Dave Person, Ketchikan, the very place where 50 people live and a \n$230 million-plus bridge is going to go to service them. So you can get \nperspective on this, $230 million for 50 people, where there is a ferry \nservice already running every 15 to 20 minutes that takes 7 minutes to \ncross, is enough money to buy each one of them a Learjet. Think about \nthat for a minute--a bridge longer than the Golden Gate for 50 people \nto a small area in Alaska. That is enough money to buy every one of the \ninhabitants a speedboat to cross any time they wanted. They could cross \nand leave the speedboat for somebody else to pick up and buy a new one \nthe very next day and still not spend this much money.\n  So the fact is, it is the priorities we have in our country that are \naskew today. The priority of spending almost one-half billion dollars \non bridges to a very small section of the population needs to be \naddressed.\n  What this amendment does is prohibit and directs no money to be spent \non these bridges. That does not mean Alaska will not get the same \namount of money. It will get the same amount of money less $75 million, \nand it directs $75 million to go to the twin span bridges of I-10 that \nwere knocked out during Hurricane Katrina.\n  My hope was that I could move all the money, but under the technical \nways we run bills and under the formula of the Transportation \nDepartment, that is not possible. I believe the American people would \nlike to see all of that. But let me quote Dave Person from Ketchikan: \nThinking about the immense disaster in the Gulf States, it occurred to \nme the most effective thing we can do as residents of our island would \nbe to return the money earmarked for our Gravina Bridge.\n  This is the people of Alaska, with compassion. They know what is \nright. They know what we should be doing.\n  Here is another citizen from Alaska: I am embarrassed to see the town \nof Ketchikan become synonymous with a $300 million bridge. If there \nwere an election right now on using the money for the bridge or \nbuilding up the New Orleans levees or repairing a bridge in New \nOrleans, almost everyone in town would say no to the bridge. Anchorage \nDaily News.\n  And: The decent--that is, the American thing--for Alaskans and our \ncongressional delegation to do would be to send these one-half billion \ndollars south to the real needs of millions, rather than spending them \nhere in Alaska on legacy projects that benefit a few.\n  Anchorage Daily News, September 13, 2005:\n\n       This money, a gift from the people of Alaska, will \n     represent more than just material aid; it will be a symbol \n     for our beleaguered democracy . . .\n       I would assume that most Ketchikan residents would agree \n     that thousands of suffering fellow citizens and billions of \n     dollars of destroyed economic and social infrastructure are \n     of higher priority than our ability to drive to the airport.\n\n  The I-10 twin span bridge in Louisiana is a 5.4-mile stretch of \nInterstate 10 over Lake Pontchartrain. It connects New Orleans with the \ncity of Slidell. The twin span serves as the major route into New \nOrleans for interstate commerce, resident mobility, and working \ncommuters. Storm surge from Hurricane Katrina caused extensive damage \nto both spans of the bridge, knocking 435 concrete segments out of \nalignment. Each segment weighs 309 tons. The eastbound span was \nrepaired with several undamaged segments from the westbound span and \nwas just opened to two-way traffic. The westbound span is not scheduled \nto be open until at least January. The Louisiana Department of \nTransportation plans to solicit bids on replacement of the twin-spin \nbridge in the spring of 2006. Each three-lane span will be elevated to \na height to avoid the type of damage that Katrina caused. The \npreliminary estimate of construction cost is $500 million and it will \ntake 3 years to build. The recently enacted Transportation bill \nincluded the $223 million for the Ketchikan Bridge and to Gravina \nIsland, a total of $229 million, or $452 million for two bridges. The \nmerits of both these projects have been questioned, wildly questioned, \nincluding by citizens of Alaska. The Ketchikan Bridge has been called \nthe bridge to nowhere--$4,460,000 per resident to build a bridge that \nalready has an adequate, safe, effective, and efficient ferry service. \nThis bridge will be nearly as long as the Golden Gate Bridge and taller \nthan the Brooklyn Bridge. The Gravina Bridge would replace the 7-minute \nferry, as I have mentioned.\n  The second Alaska bridge, the Knik Arm Bridge, is designed as a 2-\nmile toll bridge across the Knik Arm Waterway in Anchorage to Fort \nMcKenzie, and the Matanuska Valley.\n  No more than a few dozen individuals live in the area the bridge will \nserve. According to the Knik Arm Bridge and Toll Authority, the project \nwill cost $400 to $600 million. Using the estimates from a decade ago, \nthe project would cost $1.5 billion when adjusted for inflation.\n  Before it is said and done, this bridge will probably require another \n$1 billion of taxpayer money--well within the massive transportation \nbills we will be passing over the next years. But the question I ask is \nif repairing a vital interstate bridge in Louisiana, used by thousands \nand thousands and thousands of drivers every year, hundreds of \nthousands of drivers, should be a higher priority than constructing two \nmassive bridges of dubious value and little merit. We are now at $8 \ntrillion in debt as a nation, and $600 billion of that came this last \nyear. It is time we think about priorities.\n\n[[Page S11627]]\n\n  It is my understanding this amendment is going to be vigorously \nopposed by the home State Senators. This has nothing to do with my \nrespect for them but has everything to do with my respect for our \ncountry and our desire to change the way we put our priorities on \nspending. If you think about the unfunded liabilities that are coming, \n$37 trillion on Medicaid and Medicare, another $8 or $9 trillion on \nSocial Security, a debt that is soon to reach, by 2009, 2010, $12 \ntrillion, how much more can we give to our kids, our grandchildren?\n  Is it not a time when we at this point, in consideration of \neverything that is in front of us, the problems, the magnitude of the \nproblems, the structural deficit we have, make the hard choices about \npicking winners and losers that affect the most people? But more \nimportantly, isn't it about time we change the whole attitude about how \nwe operate in terms of cutting spending? The American people want to \nhelp the people of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. There is no \nquestion. They also want to help the people of Alaska, but the Alaskan \npeople have already said they are willing to help with this. We ought \nto do this. It is only $75 million that will go toward the cost, but \nthat is $75 million that won't get transferred in emergency spending \nfor our children and our grandchildren. It is something that is the \nright thing to do. It is something that is the timely thing to do. And \nit is something we ought to do not for right now but for our children \nand our grandchildren.\n  I also would note that this still gives tons of flexibility to the \nState of Alaska. There are two types of money in the highway bill, \ndiscretionary money and program money. This only takes away \ndiscretionary money and limits the program money on these two bridges, \nfor anything that comes out of discretionary will be than more than \npaid for by this elimination.\n  With that, I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I believe before long, when they complete a \nmarkup, that the Senator from Alaska--probably both Senators will be \nhere. They will have an opportunity to speak, and I am confident we \nwill hear a very different side of that story. I do not presuppose to \nspeak for the Senators from Alaska, but let me tell you my own personal \nobservations on the situation.\n  No. 1, it certainly would not have been my priority. Right now, there \nare about 50 people on the island to which Ketchikan would be \nconnected. The island has an airport on it. They view this as a major \neconomic development area for the community of Ketchikan.\n  The town has been devastated because of the Federal cutoff of timber \nsales which used to be the major industry in Ketchikan, so they are \nlooking to develop alternative sites. Ketchikan is right on the side of \na very steep mountain. It is essentially one long narrow main street. \nOnce you go off the main street, you are going up the hill. Not a great \nplace for economic development.\n  I was there, and I spoke with the leaders in the town. They view this \nas their salvation. They think this is extremely important to their \ncontinued economic development. Nevertheless, I see some real problems \nwith it because that bridge would go across an inlet which is a major \nfloatplane landing area for floatplanes coming in and out of Ketchikan. \nIn addition, large cruise ships 250 feet tall come through there. They \nwould have to build a bridge over that.\n  I am not sure this would make sense. But the fact remains, this is \nnot a decision which is being made by people from Missouri and \nWashington and other places. I did not like it, but I am an outsider.\n  The chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure \nSubcommittee made it a top priority. It is telling the people of Alaska \nthat we are going to take away highway money, which was paid into the \nhighway user trust fund, and put it into obviously a badly needed \nreconstruction project in Louisiana, which is going to be funded by the \nemergency appropriations bills that will be coming before us.\n  Secondly, I happen to believe that the money is not going to be spent \nunless the people of all of Alaska and their leaders are convinced it \nis the right place to spend it. Why do I know that? When I first came \nto Washington, I thought it would be a great idea to build a small road \nsomeplace. I put an earmark, a modest amount, in a bill for work on a \nlittle highway. The department of transportation in Missouri did not \nagree with it. That money never got spent. Roads get built, bridges get \nbuilt in areas where the State transportation authority, whether it be \nthe commissioner or the Governor, wants them to be built.\n  There is a study ongoing as to whether this bridge is needed, whether \na tunnel would be more efficient, or whether a speedier ferry system \nwould work out. The ferry is charming--not really fast going across \nfrom the airport to Ketchikan, but it will get you there. What is the \nbest way to handle it? My own personal view is that the people of \nAlaska will make that decision. I question whether they would move to \ngo ahead with that bridge. We will have an amendment, which is being \nprepared, that will say the bridge should not be built until the badly \nneeded bridge between New Orleans and Slidell is built, during which \ntime I believe the Alaska transportation authority is studying it \nbefore it would even begin to be built. I believe that is a more \nappropriate way to deal with this question.\n  I have heard lots of people complaining about this bridge, but, \nagain, most of them do not know the situation in Ketchikan. While I \nquestion it, it is not my job to say what the transportation priorities \nof Minnesota are or Alaska or Washington or other States. It raises a \nquestion in my mind, and I understand why my colleague raised it.\n  I think before we move on this amendment, we will want to hear from \nthe Senators from Alaska and look at an alternative amendment which I \nbelieve would satisfy most people's questions to make sure a badly \nneeded bridge in Louisiana is completed and also that nothing goes \nforward on the Alaska bridge until there is a study completed and the \ntransportation authority in Alaska makes a decision.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2160, as Modified\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nGrassley amendment be taken up. We can handle it in about 2 or 3 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk and \nask that my amendment be modified, which I have the right to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does have a right to modify his \namendment. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 356, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n       Sec. 408.(a) The division of the court shall release to the \n     Congress and to the public not later than 60 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act all portions of the final \n     report of the independent counsel of the investigation of \n     Henry Cisneros made under section 594(h) of title 28, United \n     States Code, except for any such portions that contain \n     information of a personal nature that the division of the \n     court determines the disclosure of which would cause a \n     clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy that outweighs the \n     public interest in a full accounting of this investigation. \n     Upon the release of the final report, the final report shall \n     be published pursuant to section 594(h)(3) of title 28, \n     United States Code.\n       (b)(1) After the release and publication of the final \n     report referred to in subsection (a), the independent counsel \n     shall continue his office only to the extent necessary and \n     appropriate to perform the noninvestigative and \n     nonprosecutorial tasks remaining of his statutory duties as \n     required to conclude the functions of his office.\n       (2) The duties referred to in paragraph (1) shall \n     specifically include--\n       (A) the evaluation of claims for attorney fees, pursuant to \n     section 593(l) of title 28, United States Code;\n       (B) the transfer of records to the Archivist of the United \n     States pursuant to section 594(k) of title 28, United States \n     Code;\n       (C) compliance with oversight obligations pursuant to \n     section 595(a) of title 28, United States Code; and\n       (D) preparation of statements of expenditures pursuant to \n     section 595(c) of title 28, United States Code.\n       (c)(1) The independent counsel shall have not more than 45 \n     days after the release and publication of the final report \n     referred to in subsection (a) to complete his remaining \n     statutory duties unless the division of the court determines \n     that it is necessary for the\n\n[[Page S11628]]\n\n     independent counsel to have additional time to complete his \n     remaining statutory duties.\n       (2) If the division of the court finds that the independent \n     counsel needs additional time under paragraph (1), the \n     division of the court shall issue a public report stating the \n     grounds for the extension and a proposed date for completion \n     of all aspects of the investigation of Henry Cisneros and \n     termination of the office of the independent counsel.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Dorgan be added as my only cosponsor on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in 15 seconds I wish to say that I \nappreciate very much the accommodations Mr. Dorgan has made and the \nfine dialog we had in bringing a compromise to my amendment. I \ncompliment him on the work he did on this issue 2 or 3 months ago on a \nsimilar amendment. I appreciate very much the cooperation we have had.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to have worked with my \ncolleague from Iowa. He offered a similar amendment to the one I \noffered some months ago. We have worked out a modification of that \namendment. I believe it advances the right interest here.\n  Let me describe what this does. It deals with an independent counsel \nand the funding for an independent counsel and the report that should \nbe published by that independent counsel. This independent counsel was \nfor investigating former Secretary Cisneros where some money allegedly \nhad been paid to someone else, lying to the FBI, et cetera. So an \nindependent counsel was created. That was nearly 11 years ago. That \nindependent counsel is still working, spending at the rate of about $2 \nmillion a year.\n  In 1995, the charge existed which caused the independent counsel to \nbe created. In 1999, Mr. Cisneros pled guilty. In 2001, Mr. Cisneros \nwas given a Presidential pardon. It is all gone, but the independent \ncounsel is still working nearly 11 years later.\n  I previously offered an amendment that had passed the Senate but then \ndied in conference that would just shut off the money. My colleague \nfrom Iowa has perhaps even a more thoughtful amendment, but it is one I \nfully support and am pleased to join him on today.\n  The reason I am is that the columnist, Mr. Novak, wrote that the \npurpose of the original amendment was to prevent a report from being \nfiled. Mr. Novak is never in doubt but not always right. My interest \nwas not in a report at all. The report, I understand, is with the \nthree-judge panel. I think everybody ought to see the report.\n  This amendment says 60 days from enactment, the report must be made \npublic with proper safeguards, as the Senator from Iowa has outlined in \nhis amendment, and 45 days after that, the funding stops for the \nindependent counsel.\n  It is the right thing to do. My colleague from Iowa is someone who \nlooks out after the taxpayers' dollars on a range of issues, and I have \njoined him on many of them. I am pleased to stop the funding for an \nindependent counsel that has been in business 11 years and seems to be \nable to do everything except stop spending money.\n  Let's get the report. The subject of the report pled guilty 6 years \nago and was the recipient of a pardon 4 years ago. It is time to stop \nthe funding. That is what the amendment does.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor with my colleague from the State of \nIowa, Mr. Grassley.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we have followed this discussion for a long \ntime. This independent counsel has been working on this investigation \nsince I was a very junior Member of the U.S. Senate. Not only has my \nhair gotten gray, but I think the independent counsel has gotten a lot \ngrayer as well. Not only does the clock keep running, but the expense \nkeeps running.\n  At the same time, there were very serious allegations raised to the \nindependent counsel, and those, I gather, have had findings attached to \nthem, whether they were accurate or not, and it is time we brought this \nto a close and find out what the independent counsel found because it \ngoes to the operation of the Department of Treasury and other agencies \nin the Federal Government. If he found a problem, it is time we go \nabout fixing the problem.\n  I know the Judiciary Committee and the Finance Committee are very \nmuch interested in this. Our committee is interested in it.\n  I thank my colleague from Iowa and my colleague from North Dakota. I \nask to be added as a cosponsor because all good things come to an end, \nand even independent counsel investigations come to an end.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to amendment No. 2160, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2160), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I want to thank the chairman and ranking \nmember of the subcommittee for the work they have done on this bill and \none thing in particular that is of concern to me and my constituents, \nwhich is Amtrak funding. I would like to, in particular, thank the two \nleaders for their outstanding support of Amtrak. It is a vital and \nimportant part of the transportation infrastructure of the Commonwealth \nof Pennsylvania. Philadelphia, in particular, and southeastern \nPennsylvania benefit greatly from the relief of congestion off our \nhighways which are incredibly congested. Amtrak provides great service \nup and down the Northeast corridor. We happen to be right in the middle \nof that corridor in Philadelphia. Philadelphia is now the second \nbusiest station, second only to New York, on that corridor, and it is \nvitally important that sufficient funds are available. The $1.45 \nbillion that is in this bill is $250 million more than last year, which \nwe appreciate, and almost $300 million more than what the House has \nappropriated in their bill.\n  I wished to come and thank the chairman and ranking member of the \ncommittee. I think the fact that we have not seen any Amtrak amendments \nto increase the funding shows we have worked very hard together to get \na good, solid number to go into conference, with the hope that we can \nget good, strong support for this vitally important part of \nsoutheastern Pennsylvania's transportation network.\n  I want to again thank the chairman and ranking member for their \nexcellent work.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the highway reauthorization bill recently \npassed the Congress. It was several years in the making and the result \nof a compromise. Now one of our colleagues feels it is his \nresponsibility to rewrite portions of that bill to achieve his goals, \nnot those that are expressed in the law itself.\n  Unfortunately, the manner in which the Senator wishes to do this has \nno impact on his constituency or any other constituency except Alaska. \nI fought for statehood as a member of the Eisenhower administration. I \nhave been here now almost 37 years. This is the first time I have seen \nany attempt by any Senator to treat my State in a way differently from \nany other State. It will not happen. It will not happen.\n  I can remember many times when other Senators have stood on the floor \nand used parliamentary devices that kept people up for 2 to 3 days. \nThis is not the way to treat a State. We are a sovereign State. If the \nSenate wishes to take part of the highway money and share it with New \nOrleans, we would be happy to join any other State. We\n\n[[Page S11629]]\n\nwould be happy to make a fair contribution in any other program. We \nhave already notified our State that many of the things we have been \nable to get funding for in the past may not be available now for a \nperiod of time until we build the area affected by Katrina or Rita.\n  Our State suffered the largest disaster in America preceding Katrina, \nthe 1964 earthquake. I remember it well. I remember being a young \nlawyer and being forced to borrow money to keep the doors of our law \nfirm open; to borrow money to repair my home that was destroyed by that \nearthquake partially; to borrow other money to help in terms of the \nconcepts of rebuilding in that area.\n  Our State faced that recovery, and I think we understand what the \npeople of New Orleans and the Katrina and Rita areas face. We now have \nanother such storm coming upon us.\n  The amendment that is before us now will affect only Alaska. It will \nhelp Louisiana. We want to help Louisiana but not solely at the expense \nof Alaska. That is not a way to treat a sovereign State. This is \nsomething on which I think every Senator must examine his or her own \nconscience. What would they do if they were faced with the proposition \nthat only their State's allocation of funds under a protective program \nwould be taken and given to another State at the time of disaster?\n  This is not the way to meet a disaster need, to turn to the \nsmallest--we have the smallest allocation per area of any State in the \nUnion for roads. We only have a very small road system. The reason is \nthat so much of our State has been withdrawn, and it is not possible to \nbuild roads through the Federal lands that are set aside for parks, \nwildlife refuges, wild and scenic rivers, wilderness areas. We are \nlimited, and we must build bridges so that we can tie together two \nareas that are inaccessible otherwise.\n  That is because of withdrawals and set-asides of lands in our State \nthat are owned by the Federal Government.\n  I ask my friend--and he is my friend--from Oklahoma, how would he \nexplain to his people at home, if he went home after the Senate had \ntaken money away from his State previously authorized by law and signed \nby the President?\n  That is not the way to treat a sovereign State. These funds that are \nnecessary for bridges in Louisiana must be provided. That is a given. \nAfter the disaster in Florida, when I was the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, notwithstanding the opposition of the \nadministration, I assisted the delegation from Florida to obtain money \nto rebuild their bridges and roads. That was from the General Treasury. \nThat may have caused a deficit. We tried our best to offset it, and I \nthink to a major extent we did offset it.\n  The request that has been made now to offset gulf coast spending \nusing the highway bill money, only that allocated to the State of \nAlaska, is unacceptable to this Senator.\n  I am now President pro tempore of the Senate, the second oldest \nMember of the Senate, the fourth in service in the Senate, and I again \nsay to my friend from Oklahoma I have never seen it suggested to single \nout one State and say, You pay for a disaster that happened 5,000 miles \naway.\n  We want to shoulder our fair share of the burden. We will do so. \nThose who want to look at this amendment as some sort of amendment that \nshould be adopted because of misleading stories in the press, I warn \nyou, it could happen to you, too. These bridges are necessary. Just \ntake the one across the Knik Arm near our largest city of Anchorage. \nAnchorage is surrounded by water on two sides and by a military \nreservation on one side and a national forest on the other. There is no \nway to expand. Across this Knik Arm is land owned by the State and by \nprivate people that we could expand to. We have been trying to get a \nbridge across there for as long as I can remember. But because we are a \nsmall State, it is hard to do.\n  The time came when one of the Members of our delegation was chairman \nand he kept pressing and pressing and finally convinced his colleagues \nthat bridge should be funded in a way that takes a sizable portion of \nour State's funding under formula money, and a portion of the so-called \nabove-the-line money, money for grants for special projects, and made \nit possible that the Knik Arm bridge could be built.\n  The other bridge is in the southeastern area. It is the largest \nforest in the United States and is practically all withdrawn, \npractically all owned by the Federal Government and set aside for \nwilderness areas or nonpublic uses. There is one portion available to \nus, but it takes a bridge to get to it. That is State land and private \nland, the only land, really, in that kind of area that can be developed \nbecause all the rest of it is owned by the Federal Government and set \naside, with the exception of some Native lands that are a little bit \nfarther away.\n  We can argue about the needs. That argument should have been made at \nthe time the highway bill passed. The highway bill allocated money for \nthose. It comes out, not from the Treasury, but out of funds paid by \npeople who buy gasoline and people who buy parts for cars, people who \nbuy various things that require them to contribute to the highway fund.\n  I have come quite often to the floor and described my State to the \nSenate. I remind the Senate, we have half the coastline of the United \nStates. We are one-fifth the size of the whole United States. We have \nmore withdrawings for parks, wildlife refuges, wild and scenic areas, \nwilderness areas than all the rest of the States put together. We need \nbridges because we need to get from one private area to another private \narea.\n  When I first came to the Senate, funds were allocated to a State \nbased on the amount of land that was Federal land in a State that was \nwithdrawn. That was dropped after Congress, in its wisdom, withdrew so \nmuch of Alaska. If we had the old formula, I can tell you, the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma wouldn't even understand the money we would get because \nmore than half of the Federal land in Alaska is withdrawn, and the \nFederal Government will own, in any event, almost two-thirds of Alaska \nno matter what happens in the future.\n  To have a representative of the Federal Government say Alaska doesn't \nneed bridges, take them away from them and repair those bridges that \nwent down in the disaster is absolutely wrong. Absolutely wrong.\n  I remember as a young man in California when someone suggested there \nought to be a bridge, what we call the Golden Gate, over the San \nFrancisco Harbor. People said: You can't do that. That is a bridge to \nnowhere. I remember those words, ``a bridge to nowhere,'' a bridge up \nin Marin County where hardly anybody lived. It was a place for cows and \nranchers. Today what is it? It is a thriving part of the great State of \nCalifornia.\n  How about the bridge from New Orleans to Baton Rouge--absolutely \ngoing into wilderness. No one ever expected it to develop. That is part \nof the area that suffered from the disaster because it was so heavily \ndeveloped.\n  How about the bridges that cross island to island going down the Keys \nin Florida? I remember as a young man going overseas, going to the edge \nof that area. You couldn't travel by road. You had to have a boat like \nyou do in Alaska. You still have to do that in Alaska. There are no \nbridges between Alaskan islands. But go to Florida and where are they? \nIt is a beautiful drive. Every one of those bridges was paid for by \nhighway money.\n  There were those who said at the time: That is a waste of taxpayers' \nmoney. It wasn't taxpayers' money anyway. It is highway-user money, and \nhighway-user money should be used for disasters only on the basis \nconsidering what the impact is on the highway system itself.\n  I have a unique role in my State because I not only served in the \nEisenhower administration, trying to urge the admission of Alaska to \nenter the Union, but it was my honor to come here after Alaska had only \nbeen a State for 10 years. In December I will have been here 37 years, \nas I said.\n  I come to warn the Senate, if you want a wounded bull on the floor of \nthe Senate, pass this amendment. I stood here and watched Senator Allen \nteach the Senate lesson after lesson after something was done to \nAlabama that he didn't like.\n  I don't threaten people; I promise people. I came here and swore to \nuphold the Constitution of the United States. I came here to represent \na\n\n[[Page S11630]]\n\nState that is an equal member of this Union. Notwithstanding how many \npeople are there, we are to be treated the same as any other State. On \nthe floor of the Senate we are equal to any other Senators, my \ncolleague and I. This amendment is an offense to me. It is not only an \noffense to me, it is a threat to every person in my State. We came here \nto have the same rights, the same privileges that were made available \nto any other State and to the people who live in those States. While we \nare one-fifth the size of the United States, we only have 13,485 miles \nof road. That is less than King County, WA. Why? Because the Congress, \nin its wisdom, has withdrawn so much of our land, as I said, that you \ncan't build roads.\n  Oklahoma is one-eighth the size of Alaska. It has almost 10 times as \nmany roads.\n  If the concepts involved in this bill were applied to States as the \nNation moved westward, we would still have wilderness beyond the \nMississippi. I really cannot understand this. Roads are the lifeblood \nof this country. That is what made us free, having the ability to move, \nhaving the ability to use individual transportation, having the ability \nto drive from Oklahoma to Alaska if you want to. I urge the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma to try to do that. When I first came here I drove home \nwhen I went home every year because I couldn't afford to fly. In those \ndays we got about seven trips, I think, annually. That didn't apply \nto our families at all.\n\n  The problem I want to leave with you is this: 70 percent of our State \nis accessible only by air or by sea. Within our State we have to have \ndifferent types of transportation. My colleague, Senator Murkowski, has \npioneered now a concept of trying to build some rural roads to connect \nvillages so we will reduce some of the Federal costs of supporting \nthose individual villages. Each has an airport, each has a school, each \nhas a clinic. These are redundant facilities. We can build better ones. \nOne could have a good school, one could have a good airport, one could \nhave a good fire department. We could do better for them and save money \nif we had more road money. But we do not get it.\n  We do not get it because of the donor theory that came to this Senate \nabout 15 years ago, which says for the people who pay in these taxes, \nit goes back to the States in which they paid the money--not where they \nlive, but where they paid the money. So the States that are fortunate \nenough to be on interstate highways where people stop to buy gasoline, \nthey get more money than the States where they don't stop for gasoline. \nIt makes less sense than anything I have ever known.\n  In any event, we live under that system. We have needs. We are still \na developing area. We are the last frontier of the United States. These \nbridges may go nowhere, as far as some people here are concerned, but \nthey are very important to our future.\n  I think it was the Memorial Bridge in Milwaukee that was first called \nthe bridge to nowhere, the Daniel Webster Hoan Bridge. That now serves \nas a major north-south connector between downtown Milwaukee and the \nneighborhoods in that city.\n  The Astoria Bridge on the Columbia River was referred to as a bridge \nto nowhere. It connects Astoria, OR, to what was once an empty shore. \nIt now carries 6,000 cars a day, over 2 million people a year. We \ndeserve the same right to grow.\n  Currently, the bridge will serve military families who live in the \nAnchorage area and pay very high costs. Because of the cost of land, \nthe rent is very high. That is because of the lack of land to expand. \nThey will go across to the Matanuska Valley and have a better place to \nlive.\n  All I want to do is put the Senate on notice. I have been asked \nseveral times today if I will agree to this version or that version of \nthe amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma. No. No, I will not, unless \nit treats all States the same way.\n  We are here to ask you, those of us from Alaska, to believe that \nfairness is fairness; equality is equality. Being a member of the 50 \nStates is being a State with the right to be treated equally to any \nother State. That is why the two of us are here, to assure that \nhappens. Praise God I have the energy to do what I may have to do, to \nprove to the Senator from Oklahoma I mean what I say. This amendment is \nnot going to pass.\n  The Senate is warned. It is wrong to do this to any State. It is \nwrong to put colleagues in a position where we have to go home and \nexplain why we couldn't prevent an amendment in which what is being \ndone to our State has never been done to another State--never.\n  This is not the time to start this process. I urge my friend from \nOklahoma to reconsider this, reconsider what he is getting us into. The \namendment may pass, but if it does the bill will never be passed. If it \ndoes, I will be taken out of here on a stretcher.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I want to start by thanking my \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Alaska. He has delivered, obviously, \na very passionate statement on behalf of the issue in front of us. But \neven more than that, he gives us the historical perspective of what we \nin Alaska have been fighting for since statehood, what we in Alaska \nhave continued to fight for almost 50 years after the fact of \nstatehood, and that is a simple recognition that we are part of the \nUnited States and that we deserve to be treated with the same level of \nrespect accorded to all of the other 49 States.\n  We are told not to take this amendment personally, but it is very \ndifficult to stand here as an Alaskan and not take this personally. So \nI rise with my colleague to speak very strongly in opposition to a \nmeasure that is going to isolate us, that is going to pinpoint one \nState above everybody else to say: You are responsible; it is dollars \ndirected to your State that we will now redirect to the devastation in \nthe gulf area.\n  Alaskans are not hesitant to step up to the plate and help. We do it \nday in, we do it day out. We want to continue to be able to do that. \nBut when we are singled out as one State, saying, Your project is not \nworthy; of all the other projects out there we are going to go after \nyours, it is not the time to be sitting back and saying we can \ncompromise on this, we can make a deal.\n  There has been a great deal of discussion about this bridge. Let us \nspeak first to the bridge in Ketchikan. It has been referred to on this \nfloor as a bridge to nowhere. There have been references to media \naccounts about the community of Ketchikan and the project they have \nbeen working on for years and years. What I am hearing repeated in the \nChamber and what I have seen in letters to us as Senate colleagues is a \nrepetition of what we hear in the media, the same tired, worn-out facts \nthat quite honestly aren't true, don't hold water, and yet get \nrepeated. And the inaccuracies and the misrepresentations just make our \njob that much more difficult. It is as if we are legislating by the \nmedia, and we are better than that. It is our obligation to know and \nunderstand the facts that are real and to know and understand the \nimplications and the impact of our actions.\n  I wish to talk about a couple of the facts that Members of this body \nneed to know. If, in fact, what we intend to do here, if, in fact, this \namendment is intended to provide for reconstruction of the twin-span \nbridge, it is eligible for emergency repair funds. Negotiations for its \nrepair are already underway between the State of Louisiana and the \nFederal agency. I am confident that this bridge will be repaired \nwithout needless damage to the project from any other State. And if, in \nfact, there is a funding mechanism that we need to resolve to help make \nthis happen, I am certainly willing to participate in that. I think all \nof us would be willing to participate. If we need to do something to \nmake this project move forward with the funding mechanism, we can help \nwith that.\n  The second fact, if this is being proposed as an amendment that is \ngoing to save money, people need to know that it swaps an earmark for \nour project in Alaska--the two bridges--to an earmark for a project in \nLouisiana. The project is going to be completed anyway whether or not \nthis amendment is going to be considered. What we are essentially doing \nis taking the money from the Alaska project, we are directing it to \nallow the project, but we are reducing Louisiana's ability to have any \nkind of spending flexibility at a time when they need it the most. Let\n\n[[Page S11631]]\n\nus make sure that what we are proposing here is actually going to meet \nthe needs of those in Louisiana.\n  The third fact--this is where we need to get into the discussion \nabout the bridges and what they are because the reference to the bridge \nin Ketchikan as being a bridge to nowhere is offensive. It is a bridge \nto the future for the people of Ketchikan, AK.\n  I was born in Ketchikan. I spend a fair amount of time going back and \nforth between Anchorage and Ketchikan and have done so for years. I was \nin Ketchikan this past weekend. I wasn't guided by occasional letters \nto the editor; I was guided by talking to the people in Ketchikan who \nask: Where are we on the bridge? They are asking me: Lisa, where are we \non the bridge? We put the money in the transportation bill finally, \nafter so many years of waiting, how are we going to move forward on it? \nThey are concerned because they are getting copies of the articles that \nare in the New York Times and in other publications around the country \ncalling it a bridge to nowhere, and they are saying: Don't these people \nunderstand who we are and what we need? That is the problem. Most of \nyou don't understand who we are up there and what we need.\n  We need basic infrastructure. Senator Stevens has spoken to that. If \nwe had a terrible disaster hit us in Alaska, we would not face a lot of \nthe repairs to the infrastructure because we don't have the \ninfrastructure in the first place to repair.\n  The arguments that have been made or the statements that have been \nmade about a bridge that will connect to 50 people do not acknowledge \nany understanding about Ketchikan and what it is and what kind of a \ncommunity it is and what it has to respond to.\n  Those of you who have been to Alaska because you have been up on a \ncruise ship enter through Ketchikan. We call it Alaska's First City. \nYou enter into the Tongass Narrows. As you come in, you see a community \nthat is smashed up literally against a rocky terrain, a long, \nstretched-out community with islands dotted all around you. People ask: \nWhy do you need this bridge? We need the bridge because on the other \nside of Ketchikan is the potential for this community to grow and \nthrive, despite some of the actions of the Federal Government, and the \npolicies that have been made over the years, whether they relate to \ntimber or farm fishing, have practically shut down the community. But \nwe are coming back. We have a thriving maritime industry we are helping \nto grow and to cultivate. But we have a community of some 13,000 to \n14,000 people in Ketchikan. It is 6 blocks deep and 16 miles wide.\n  We can't expand to the south and the east because we are bordered in \nby the Misty Fjords National Monument on the north, and we are hemmed \nin by the Behm Canal. The only place that Ketchikan has an opportunity \nto expand is right across the Tongass Narrows on Gravina Island. \nGravina Island has a sloping area. It is wide open. But the best thing \nthat Gravina Island has is some 20,000 acres of private, municipal, and \nState lands that can make a huge difference in providing economic \nopportunities for this area. We can't grow in any other direction in \nKetchikan. We have to go across the narrows.\n  Right now, across the narrows, we have the airport. This is an \nairport that doesn't just serve the 13,000 or 14,000 residents of \nKetchikan; this airport is the cargo hub for southeastern Alaska. You \nhave FedEx and UPS coming in there. You have all of the aircargo coming \ninto the southeastern part of the State.\n  You also have a small logging operation, one of the few that is \nhanging on after the policies we have implemented here in Congress. But \nwe have a business that employs 50 to 100 people. Every day, those \npeople are not able to get into their car and drive to work. They take \na ferry to work and have to figure out how to do it on the other end.\n  The airport is also incredibly important to our military over there. \nEvery nuclear sub that goes on Pacific patrol is tested for stealth at \nthe Navy facility in Behm Canal. We have technicians coming into the \nairport. We have our Ketchikan Coast Guard base. It is at this base \nthat they maintain most of the aid to navigation in the State of \nAlaska. The Forest Service certainly has a very large presence there. \nKetchikan's hospital is a regional center. We get many of the patients \nvisiting Ketchikan from the surrounding areas.\n  On top of that, we have a tourist industry where this summer the city \nof Ketchikan welcomed some 800,000 passengers into that community--800-\nsome-odd thousand passengers that occasionally need to get off those \ncruise ships. Some of them have medical issues. Some of them need to \nuse our airport.\n\n  We have an airport that is serviced by a ferry. But that ferry isn't \nthe answer to everything we need. When we have some extreme tides, they \ncan't utilize that ferry. What does that mean if you have a Medivac \ngoing out to the airport when you can't get the ambulance over there? \nYou can't get to the other side with the vehicles we need. In fact, we \nhave a ferry service, but is it what we need? Is it what we were \npromised when the airport was put back there in 1973? The promise at \nthat time was, we will connect you across the very narrow channel of \nwater to the community of Ketchikan. The people of Ketchikan have been \nwaiting for 30 years.\n  Some people are making the assumption that just because we happen to \nhave a chairman on the House side chairing the Transportation \nCommittee, that all of a sudden any great idea, any project that we \nwant as a delegation we were going to be able to snap our fingers and \nget. This is something that has been in the works for 30 years. Ask the \npeople of Ketchikan how much money, time, and energy they have spent in \nthe various studies, discussing dialog, debating, fighting. It is not \nsomething that just came up because we could have it; it is something \nthat we as a community have been working together and pulling together \nfor a long time.\n  Now to have a colleague come in and say that because there is \nsomething that has happened in another part of the country and because \nwe need to find ways to pay for it, we are going to make a \ndetermination that we are going to pluck this money and we are going to \ntake this project and anything that the community has put into it, \nanything the State has put into it, is now thrown out the window, that \nis not it.\n  The local government in Ketchikan has been working on a balanced \nplan--a use development plan--where we are talking about private homes \nover there, businesses, industrial facilities, harbors, green spaces to \nenhance the environmental value. We are trying to plan for our growth \nand development, but you can't have the growth and you can't have the \ndevelopment if you do not have access. Access is our State's biggest \nchallenge.\n  As Senator Stevens has mentioned, the biggest State in the Union has \nthe smallest number of roads. People look at it and say, It just \ndoesn't make sense in Alaska where you have a limited number of people, \nand yet we spend so much money on Alaska. It must be wrong, you must be \ntaking too much. The sad fact is, folks, we are a long way from the \nrest of the country, and it costs more. That is a reality. That is a \nreality of doing business up there. But because our transportation \ncosts might be more, might be higher, might be greater, does that mean \nour projects are worth any less, have any less value?\n  There was a statement made by my colleague from Oklahoma. He said it \nis important to know what the people of Alaska are thinking, and he \nread a couple of letters to the editor that were published in the \nKetchikan Daily News and a couple of letters which were published in \nthe Anchorage Daily News. I do not know about the rest of my Senate \ncolleagues, but I do not make my policy decisions based on a couple of \nletters to the editor.\n  I will ask at the appropriate time to have printed in the Record a \ncopy of a letter that the Ketchikan Chamber of Commerce has posted on \ntheir Web site speaking about Ketchikan's ``bridge to the future,'' \nrefuting many of the allegations that have been out there. I wish to \nread one quick passage because it kind of sums up the position of the \npeople from Ketchikan.\n\n       Statements like ``The Bridge to No Where'', and serves only \n     50 people'' simply are not supported by the facts. The bridge\n\n[[Page S11632]]\n\n     will provide road access to Ketchikan's International Airport \n     which serves approximately 130,000 passengers annually and \n     employs 180 people daily. In August, the shuttle ferry ride \n     required between the airport and Ketchikan serviced 31,000 \n     passengers. In addition to the airport, there is a viable \n     sawmill employing 50-100 people who will not have to take a \n     daily boat ride back and forth to Gravina Island for work. \n     During extreme ocean tide levels, the ferry is incapable of \n     transporting vehicles, including typical safety vehicles such \n     as fire trucks! The Alaska Department of Transportation \n     evaluation indicates over the long run the bridge is cheaper \n     to build and maintain than providing inadequate ferry \n     service.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Ketchikan Chamber of Commerce,\n\n                                                Ketchikan, Alaska.\n     Re Ketchikan's Bridge to the Future.\n\n       It is quite heartening to see how quickly American \n     citizens, businesses, and communities pull together to help \n     others when a natural disaster strikes such as the recent \n     hurricanes in the Gulf Zone. Ketchikan, Alaska's future home \n     of the now famous Bridge to the Future, and home to over \n     13,000 real people, held a Katrina hurricane relief fund \n     raiser and netted over $18,000. This contribution is only \n     from the fundraiser, and does not include many more donations \n     given by and through our local businesses and churches. This \n     has demonstrated the community's giving and compassionate \n     nature despite of the Ketchikan's loss of thousands of family \n     jobs, loss of small support businesses, and a 20 percent drop \n     in school enrollment, due to the needless reduction of a wood \n     fiber supply from the nation's largest Federal forest and its \n     resultant closure of our local pulp mill, historically \n     Ketchikan's largest employer.\n       It is equally disheartening to see how quickly anti-\n     development and fiscal conservative groups are jumping on the \n     bandwagon to use the hurricane disasters to attack federal \n     funding of transportation projects, feathering their desire \n     to stop modern-day development in Alaska. The continual \n     spreading of misleading and false statements to gain \n     emotional and/or political support for their objectives seems \n     to be normal practice for these anti development groups and \n     the news media. Whether seeking to stop the construction of a \n     bridge and u1timately any economic development within the \n     community of Ketchikan or for grasping for an audience, the \n     use of misleading and false statements is not only wrong, but \n     just plain destructive.\n       Statements like ``The Bridge to No Where'', and ``serves \n     only 50 people'' simply are not supported by the facts. The \n     bridge will provide road access to Ketchikan's International \n     Airport which serves approximately 130,000 passengers \n     annually and employees 180 people daily. In August, the \n     shuttle ferry ride required between the airport and \n     Ketchikan--serviced 31,000 passengers. In addition to the \n     airport, there is a viable sawmill employing 50-100 people \n     who will not have to take a daily boat ride back and forth to \n     Gravina Island for work. During extreme ocean tide levels, \n     the ferry is incapable of transporting vehicles, including \n     typical safety vehicles such as fire trucks! The Alaska \n     Department of Transportation evaluation indicates over the \n     long run the bridge is cheaper to build and maintain than \n     providing inadequate ferry service.\n       Beyond the existing international airport, there are 20,195 \n     acres of private, borough, and state-owned land to be served \n     by the bridge access road. The Ketchikan Gateway Borough has \n     an approved balanced land use development plan that provides \n     for private homes, commercial businesses, industrial \n     complexes, harbors, and green space. In a state where there \n     is only 1 percent private land and 99 percent untaxable \n     federal, state, and native corporation land, it is \n     challenging for local governments to fund local needs. As \n     every State developed ``Bridges to No Where'' were built, \n     seen by those States as Bridges to the Future. Today, \n     those bridges are merely seen as normal transportation \n     infrastructure. As the final frontier, Alaska is stuck in \n     the time warp of the mid-1900's, where infrastructure \n     deemed normal in the continental U.S. is viewed as \n     extravagant for Alaska. Ketchikan, Alaska, has worked for \n     over 30 years to achieve funding of a bridge similar in \n     many respects to the hundreds of bridges in the Gulf Coast \n     that connect communities to surrounding small islands \n     filled with residential homes and businesses.\n       Ketchikan has been promised a bridge to the airport since \n     it went into operation in 1973. How much longer do we have to \n     wait?\n       The statement ``It's pretty obvious that, at least on the \n     grass-roots, everyday-citizen level, there's a consensus that \n     the money could be better spent on the Gulf'' made by the \n     coordinator for the Alaska Transportation Priorities Project \n     (a group hatched and coordinated by the anti-development \n     environmental groups in Alaska) is clearly untrue, \n     inaccurate, and not the feeling of the citizens of Ketchikan \n     who supported the Gravina Bridge in a referendum vote by a \n     margin 2 to 1. There may be consensus among the anti-\n     development groups, but we are grass-roots, everyday-citizens \n     also. The majority of our community continues to support our \n     ``Bridge to the Future''.\n       I applaud the Alaska Congressional Delegation and the \n     others in the Nation's Congress for recognizing that Alaska \n     is a developing State, and their ability to help Alaska's \n     delayed infrastructure development through the Federal \n     Transportation Bill.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Blaine Ashcraft,\n\n                               Business Manager, Greater Ketchikan\n                                              Chamber of Commerce.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in addition to the airport, we have the \nsawmill.\n  My point is, at some point in time, those back here who do not know \nand understand Alaska need to listen to those of us who live in Alaska, \nwho work in Alaska, and who raise our families in Alaska, to know and \nunderstand what the priorities are of Alaskans and allow us to address \nthose. That is what we are trying to do with the 12 projects that are \nthe subjects of this amendment. I have been speaking about the \nKetchikan project, and I want to stick with this for a few more minutes \nuntil I turn to the Knik Arm Crossing. We in Alaska are willing to do \nour share. I made that statement earlier. The citizens in Ketchikan, \nwhen they saw the aftermath in Katrina, didn't sit back and say, Well, \nwe got ours. We are a long way away from the gulf, we don't need to \nworry about it. Private people have been dipping into their pockets, as \nthey have all across the country, but we had a fundraiser in Ketchikan \na couple weeks ago. We had fishermen, businessmen, housewives, \nteachers, shipfitters, booksellers, doctors, and clerks, raised almost \n$20,000 out of this little community of about 14,000 people.\n\n  We are willing to step up. Alaskans are willing to step up. Believe \nme, this week we have had an opportunity to talk about that as we dealt \nwith the issue of ANWR in the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources \nyesterday. We want to help out. We are prepared to do it. But let us \nprioritize those projects within the State of Alaska that have the \nsupport and that will allow our State to develop as every other State \nin the Union has been allowed to develop. Ketchikan is asking for \nnothing more than exactly the same type of bridge connection that other \ncommunities all across the country have. However, Ketchikan and most of \nthe other communities in my State are stuck in this time warp, a mid-\n1900s time warp, where transportation systems that are old hat or \naccepted and part of the landscape in the rest of the country are still \nthe future to the State of Alaska. What we are trying to do is to \nbridge into the future.\n  Now I turn, for a minute, to the Knik Arm Crossing because we have \nnot given as much attention to that. Maybe it is because the media \nhasn't dubbed it or given it a catchy little name such as ``Bridge to \nNowhere.'' As Senator Stevens has indicated, again, we are a victim of \nour own geography. We are hemmed in by the mountains, the ocean, Cook \nInlet, military land, and national forest lands. We don't have any \nplace to grow. This is Alaska's largest community. We need to be able \nto go across the water so we can have the opportunity, as a community, \nas a State, and as a regional hub, to further our growth and \ndevelopment.\n  The comment was made on the Point MacKenzie--one side is Anchorage \nand the other side is Point MacKenzie--we have about 12 residents \nthere; again, making us look like we are just going to build bridges \nbecause we have the ability to build bridges and we do not care where \nwe are placing them. People that make statements such as this need to \nlook at the facts. First, look at a map. Look at what we have over \nthere. We have a community, the fastest growing part of the State is up \nthere in the Mat-Su Valley. We have tens of thousands of commuters \ncoming into Anchorage from the Mat-Su Valley every day that could be \naided by a bridge across the water. To suggest we have 12 families that \nwe are somehow helping out and connecting defies the facts. It is \noffensive to me. There has been some suggestion this is a project that \nwe are taking up because we can. People need to understand this is \nsomething we have been looking at and studying for a good 30 years.\n  I cannot tell the number of projects--actually, I can tell the number \nof projects, and I am going to. We have, over the past, probably 10, 20 \nyears, so studied this bridge, so evaluated this\n\n[[Page S11633]]\n\nbridge, that the people in south central are asking, What's wrong? Why \ncan't we get the bridge moving? We had the Point MacKenzie Area Which \nMerits Special Attention Plan in 1993; the Point MacKenzie Port Master \nPlan in 1998; the Regional Port of Anchorage Master Plan in 1999; the \nAnchorage 2020 Plan in 2001; the Anchorage Metropolitan Area \nTransportation Solutions Freight Mobility Study in 2001; the Matanuska \nSusitna Borough Economic Development Plan in 2002; the Anchorage \nMetropolitan Area Transportation Solutions Long Range Transportation \nPlan Amendment in 2002; the Regional Transportation Planning \nOrganization Resolution Supporting the Knik Arm Crossing as a Regional \nTransportation Priority Project in 2003; the Matanuska-Susitna Borough \nAssembly Resolution Adopting the Knik Arm Crossing as the Number One \nRegional Transportation Priority, 2003; and then the Matanuska-Susitna \nBorough Rail Corridor Study, June 2003. And there have been more \nupdates since then.\n  This is something we have been working on for a long time. To suggest \nthis is pork, this is fluff, this is servicing 12 families or 50 homes, \nwe need to have everyone look at the factories and understand that \nAlaska will never achieve its full potential as a State unless we have \naccess.\n  Taking away these two projects from the State of Alaska and saying \nthis is what we are going to do to help with the reconstruction efforts \nin the gulf, to single out one State, we start taking it very \npersonally.\n  If the suggestion were made to our colleagues that everybody gives a \nlittle bit, everybody gives a little bit on your transportation \nprojects, that is okay. As one of the 50 States, we can deal with that. \nWe can certainly accept that. But to see we are looking at one State--\nfirst it was one project, now it is two projects--this Senator cannot \naccept, will not accept a proposal like that.\n  I appreciate the efforts of so many that have been working so hard as \nwe try to find offsets, as we try to do the work necessary to rebuild \nthe gulf region. But we need to recognize, again, we worked on a \ntransportation authorization bill, a 6-year plan. This bill was 6 years \nin the making. What went into it, went into it with thought and study \nand the support of those people who would benefit from it. And the \npeople that will benefit from the bridges in Ketchikan and the bridge \nin south-central are not only the people of Alaska but all of the \ntourists we serve, all of the military we serve, all of the people that \nrely on Alaska for your energy needs, for your commerce needs. It is \nnot about providing service and assistance to a few. Let Alaska come \ninto this century when it comes to transportation infrastructure. Don't \ntake from us our ability to grow, as all of the other States in the \nlower 48 have been allowed to do, having been provided the Federal \nfunding. Don't deny Alaska.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I find myself in a strange position, as I indicated to \nthe Senator from Oklahoma. Earlier today, I indicated to the Senator \nthat I would suggest a series of second-degree amendments. I had under \nconsideration second-degree amendments. It is my understanding now the \namendment of the Senator from Oklahoma is filed as a second-degree \namendment to the Bingaman amendment, am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. It is a second-degree \namendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have a small Bible to start reading, a \nfew editorials from my State concerning this bridge and some of the \ncomments that have been made in other States. I am willing to try to \nwork out a system so that all States contribute to assisting our sister \nState in Louisiana and recognize their prior need for money, but I am \nentirely unwilling to take money from Alaska only. I think the Senate \nought to have that on notice. I will suggest the absence of a quorum, \nand I will object to taking it off until we have some way that the \nSenate might consider an alternative to the Senator from Oklahoma or \nuntil a quorum is present and the Senate decides otherwise than what I \nhave decided.\n  I will put the Senate on notice--and I don't kid people--if the \nSenate decides to discriminate against our State and take money only \nfrom our State, I will resign from this body. This is not the Senate I \ncame to. This is not the Senate I devoted 37 years to. If one Senator \ncan decide he will take all the money from one State to solve a problem \nof another, that is not a union. That is not equality and is not \ntreating my State the way I have seen it treated for 37 years.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask the pending amendment to be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2162\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have 12 amendments that have been cleared \non both sides of the aisle. We thank the sponsors of these amendments \nfor working with our staff and the relevant committees for clearing \nthese amendments. I call up on behalf of Senator Reed of Rhode Island \namendment No. 2162. This amendment has been cleared on both sides. It \nrequires the Department of the Treasury to submit a report on the \napplication of Treasury regulations on arbitrage bonds to the reserve \nfunds held by EPA clean water and safe drinking water State revolving \nfunds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], for Mr. Reed of Rhode \n     Island, proposes an amendment numbered 2162.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require a legal basis for the application of arbitrage \n  bond regulations to reserve funds held by the Clean Water and Safe \n                 Drinking Water State revolving funds)\n\n       On page 293, after line 25, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. APPLICATION OF ARBITRAGE BOND REGULATIONS TO CERTAIN \n                   STATE REVOLVING FUNDS.\n\n       Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall submit a report \n     to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate to provide a legal basis for \n     the application of section 1.148-1(c) of the United States \n     Treasury Regulations (regarding arbitrage bond regulations) \n     to the reserve funds held by the Clean Water and Safe \n     Drinking Water State revolving funds which generally contain \n     replacement proceeds but not bond proceeds.\n\n  Mr. BOND. It has been cleared on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2162) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2174\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Murray and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], for himself and Mrs. \n     Murray, proposes an amendment numbered 2174.\n\n  Mr. BOND.

This partnership \nhas increased electronic tax filing by improving access to filing and \nmaking tax preparation and filing easier for taxpayers.\n  This language is not meant to disrupt or override current \nnegotiations or the new agreement.\n  It is critical that the Free File Program and other IRS taxpayer \nservices continue to evolve to meet the needs of taxpayers across the \nNation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

No funds provided under Section 1702 of the Safe, \n     Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A \n     Legacy for Users (Public Law 109-59; 119 Stat. 1144) for the \n     construction or reconstruction of any bridge shall be \n     expended until nonemergency funds have been made available \n     for the repair of the Twin Spans Bridge connecting New \n     Orleans and Slidell, Louisiana.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is my understanding the first \namendment offered by the Senator from Oklahoma will be considered \nfirst.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2165, as Modified\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the purpose of my amendment does not have \nthat much to do with Alaska as it does with priorities in our country. \nWe put forward $600 billion of debt to our children last year ending \nSeptember 30. We have a war going on. We have the largest natural \ncatastrophe we have ever seen in our history. We have a hurricane \ncoming on Florida. We are at war. It is time we reassess the priorities \nwe utilize in this body as we think about our obligations at home.\n  The purpose of my amendment is to move $125 million out of above-the-\nline money--not program money, not formula money--to be used for this. \nI understand there is going to be another amendment. My hope is the \nAmerican public will see how we are spending money and encourage us to \nspend it in a way that is more frugal and consistent with the heritage \nwe have in the country, and that is making sacrifices today for the \nfuture of our country and for the next generation.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I do not have a better friend than my \ncolleague from Oklahoma, but it does not mean we always agree with each \nother. I have had a policy in voting for amendments on bills that I \nhave adhered to for a long time, and it is if a Senator has a bill or \nan amendment that takes authority from an elected official and places \nit in the hands of an unelected bureaucrat and it does not save money, \nthen I think it is not good policy. Unfortunately, I think that is what \nthis does.\n  My good friend Senator Coburn and I have talked about this. I know it \nis a difficult thing for a lot of people to understand. Many people are \nwatching this. I happen to be the person with the No. 1 most \nconservative rating in the Senate and yet I am not about to put myself \nin a position where I am going to take authority away from someone who \nhas to stand for election in a particular State and give it to someone \nwho does not have to stand for election, period.\n  I do not think that is a good idea. If it were something that saved \nmoney, I would have a different position on it, but in that respect I \nwill oppose this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 11 seconds.\n  Mr. COBURN. Was Senator Inhofe's time taken from my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It was not.\n  Mr. COBURN. I would say to my friend, whom I love dearly as a friend \nand a brother, this amendment is about changing the priorities in this \ncountry. We can reject that or we can accept it. I gave a speech this \nmorning about the rumble that is out there in this country. We need to \nlisten to that rumble. The rumble is the American people want us to \nstart doing a better job of prioritizing how we spend money. I respect \nhis position on this. I have no ill feelings that he will oppose me on \nthis amendment.\n  This is an amendment that is good for the country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the Senator from Oklahoma who has just \nspoken, who is the author of this amendment, has indicated we need to \nbe making sacrifices. I do not think anyone in the State of Alaska \nfeels we should not be contributing, but we do not feel in the State of \nAlaska that it should be coming entirely from one State. This amendment \nputs the sacrifice on one State.\n  I urge rejection of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would add to my colleague's comment to \nsay this concept is a concept that every State should think about \nbecause if it can be done on a bridge, why not do it on any type of \nevent where a Senator would like to have money for their State, but \nthey say take it from another State because they do not need it. I made \na statement earlier today that in my 37 years I have never seen this. I \nhave never seen a request that money for a disaster be taken solely \nfrom a project in one State to help a disaster in other States.\n  We are a disaster-prone State. We have more disasters than any other \nState in the Union. Remember our 1964 earthquake. We have tsunamis. We \nhave all types of disasters. But we have never tried to take moneys \nfrom other States to meet our costs.\n  I urge the Senate not to start this process.\n  I yield back the time.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to Coburn amendment No. 2165, as \nmodified.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Arizona (Mr. McCAIN).\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Corzine) \nand the Senator from New York (Mr. Schumer) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 15, nays 82, as follows:\n\n[[Page S11637]]\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 262 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--15\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bayh\n     Burr\n     Coburn\n     Conrad\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Feingold\n     Graham\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Sessions\n     Sununu\n     Vitter\n\n                                NAYS--82\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Corzine\n     McCain\n     Schumer\n  The amendment (No. 2165), as modified, was rejected.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, my colleagues, Senator Murkowski, Senator \nFrist, and I offered the second amendment establishing the principle \nthat if this type of money is to be made available to an area of \ndisaster, it would come equally from the projects that are authorized \nunder the highway bill and above the line area for bridges.\n  In view of this vote taken, I would be willing to withdraw this \namendment. I understand there is objection to that. There is already a \nunanimous consent request that the amendment be presented.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Again, I say some Members voted the way they did on the \nCoburn amendment because of the presence of this amendment and wish to \nbe recorded in favor of this amendment.\n  I yield my time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I could have the attention of my \ncolleagues, tomorrow we are starting on the appropriations bill of \nLabor, Health and Human Services, and Education. It is a very complex \nbill. We are advised preliminarily that there will be many amendments \noffered. Senator Harkin and I sent out a ``Dear Colleague'' letter \nurging all Members who have amendments to have them ready to file.\n  I have consulted with the majority leader. I have long advocated that \nif we have quorum calls and amendments not ready to go, that we go to \nthird reading and final passage. I am not sure how effective that \napproach will be, but I am going to try it. I have been talking about \nit for a long time. The majority leader is encouraging on it.\n  But I want to put everybody on notice that we are going to press very \nhard and also on the vote on 15 and 5.\n  Again, I am not the majority leader. I know that. Whether it will be \nenforced is another matter. But this is a tough bill, and there are \nmany people who are working on it who need to go back to the \nconfirmation process of Harriet Miers.\n  We have a lot of work to do. I want to be as emphatic as I can--that \nif you have amendments, get them ready because I will press for third \nreading.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, has there been time set aside to speak in \nopposition to the pending amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 minutes in \nopposition to the pending amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 minute.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Objection.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The time hasn't expired yet.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Wasn't there time \non both sides for that amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was prior to the first vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that there be \nequal time for anyone to speak for 2 minutes, at least. I have 2 \nminutes on my side.\n  I ask unanimous consent to allow 2 minutes for the Senator from \nIllinois on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will be very brief.\n  Understand what this amendment says: No bridge in the highway bill \ncan be built until this bridge in Louisiana is built from non-emergency \nfunds, financed from non-emergency funds. If they take any part of the \n$60 billion that we have already put in FEMA to put into construction \nof this bridge, it doesn't count. It has to be nonemergency funds.\n  So understand that it is slowing down the construction of bridges \neverywhere until we appropriate more money for financing this bridge in \nLouisiana.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment, and the clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Wyoming (Mr. Enzi), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain), \nand the Senator from Wyoming (Mr. Thomas).\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S11638]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 2065\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, amendment No. 2065 \nis agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2065) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the only \namendments in order will be those that are accepted to be in the \nmanagers' package. There is a Leahy-Coleman amendment, two amendments \nfrom Senator Landrieu. We have two amendments we are going to accept \nfrom Senator Coburn. We have an amendment we are accepting from Senator \nBill Nelson.\n  Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. And Bingaman.\n  Mr. BOND. And Senator Bingaman's amendment. It is done?\n  Mr. REID. Bingaman is done.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Leahy-Coleman.\n  Mr. BOND. The Leahy-Coleman amendment will be one of them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we are going to try to resolve these \namendments as quickly as possible. I know everyone wants to get out of \nhere.\n  I suggest that perhaps Senator Landrieu can address her amendments \nvery quickly. I am going to talk with Senator Leahy and Senator \nColeman, and see if we can resolve those.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Louisiana wants to \nspeak in a moment. I want to make an inquiry of the majority leader, if \nI could. It will only take a moment.\n  I don't know where Senator Snowe is. We were talking a moment ago. \nShe is the chairperson of the Small Business Committee. I am the \nranking member. We have been making a bona fide, bipartisan effort to \ntry to get the Small Business Hurricane Relief and Reconstruction Act \ninto law. It has been sitting up in the conference and is sort of stuck \nat the moment.\n  The problem is that--Mr. President, could we have order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Could we have order, please. Will Senators \ntake their conversations off the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the administration has set up two major \npieces of relief for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, totaling $62 billion, \nbut not one penny of that $62 billion is designated for small business, \neven though there are several hundred thousand small businesses that \nare in need of relief in the region.\n  Only 84 out of some 20,000-plus requests--only 84 requests--for loans \nor grants have been approved by the Small Business Administration. So \nthis is becoming an incredibly backed-up, serious restraint on the \nability of small businesses to get back on their feet in the injured \nareas.\n  I know Senator Snowe is deeply concerned about it. I know a lot of \ncolleagues are very deeply concerned about this. Is there a way we \ncould try next week to break this out? It has passed 96 to 0 here in \nthe Senate. We desperately need to get this help to those businesses in \nthe communities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, to my distinguished colleague from \nMassachusetts, are you talking about the small business reauthorization \nor the Katrina-focused legislation?\n  Mr. KERRY. This is the Katrina small business hurricane relief and \nreconstruction bill. What is it? It is S. 1807.\n  Mr. FRIST. The Senator's question, that it has passed the Senate or \nis being considered?\n  Mr. KERRY. It passed the Senate 96 to 0.\n  Mr. FRIST. The question to me is what, again?\n  Mr. KERRY. The question is whether--I know the chairman wants to make \nthis happen--if we could try to break this out and pass it separately, \npass it in the House, and get this immediate assistance into the hands \nof the small businesses. It would make an enormous difference, \nobviously.\n  Mr. FRIST. Obviously, we need to focus on small business. We know how \nimportant that is in terms of both the flexibility and the release of \nregulations. The focus on small business is part of that rebuilding and \nrenewal in a smarter way. I would be happy to talk to the Senators who \nare involved to see how we could address it.\n  I am not going to make any commitment at this point in time, but the \nSenate has spoken in terms of a very significant vote on the floor. I \nwill be happy to talk to my colleagues about how we can, in some way, \naccelerate that next week.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, if I could, will the majority leader \nyield for a question?\n  I ask the majority leader and the Senator from Massachusetts, did \nthey know that today the report came out from the Small Business \nAdministration, which the chairman knows, the Senator from Maine, Ms. \nSnowe, that 53,900 businesses have applied for help, and that only 58 \nbusinesses have received checks to date?\n  Let me repeat, 53,900 businesses have asked for help, and, to date, \n58 in the whole region--from Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, and \nAlabama--have received help--58 businesses. So I think the Senator from \nMassachusetts raises a good point.\n  Did you know there is some urgency, Mr. Leader, about this situation?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana. She is \nright about the number that received checks. I think it was a total of \n84 that received approval. But that is out of tens of thousands, as we \nhave heard.\n  The problem is, if you are going to bring the communities back, you \nare going to have to get these small businesses up on their feet \nbecause they are the heart of that kind of recovery.\n  So again, I think it is a bipartisan initiative. And my hope is--I \nlook forward to talking with the leader and seeing how we can expedite \nthis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, again, we are absolutely committed to \naddressing the concerns of both of the Senators in a bipartisan way. I \nwill make it very clear, the legislation and the amendment the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts is talking about did pass in a \nbipartisan way here. We need to continue to address the problem--a very \nreal problem--to promote small business as a big part--a big part, a \nhuge part--of the rebuilding and renewal that we all know needs to be \naccelerated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, while the managers are making final \ndecisions about the package, could I have 4 minutes to speak about an \namendment I am going to offer but not ask for a vote on?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BOND. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to ask for \norder, if I could. I have an amendment I am going to speak about but \nnot ask for a vote on. I would appreciate my colleagues' focus for a \nmoment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is not in order.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The amendment I was going to offer to the underlying \nHUD appropriations bill is part of a blueprint for action that our \ndelegation--Republicans and Democrats--from Louisiana has asked the \nCongress to consider. Not only would this work for Louisiana, \nMississippi, Alabama, and Texas today, but if something like this were \nin law, it could work for every city and every State in the event that \nsome catastrophic event occurred, where hundreds of thousands of homes \nwere destroyed and people were displaced.\n  My amendment, which I am not going to ask for a vote on but will \noffer at some time, would provide for a 6-month deferral from \nmortgages--not a waiver of mortgages, not a forgiveness of mortgages, \nbut 6 months for Americans, for families to get their legs underneath \nthem, until they can figure out what their insurance is going to cover \nand not cover, where their children might go to school, where they \nmight find a job. These are Americans who have worked hard, played by \nthe rules, invested in their home--which is their largest asset--and, \nin the blink of an eye, it is gone.\n  In the United States of America, in the year 2005, we do not have in \nplace a system to give them a break--not for\n\n[[Page S11639]]\n\na month, not for 2 months, not for 3 months.\n  The average savings on a mortgage would be $4,317 in Louisiana, \n$4,740 in Alabama, $4,131 in Mississippi, and $4,875 would be a 6-month \naverage mortgage. The families in my State could use this extra money. \nNo administrative costs, no contractors, no fraud, no waste, no abuse, \nsimple, 6-month deferment on mortgages, put 6 months at the end of your \nmortgage, give people some cash and breathing room.\n  It is a sound amendment. Our delegation thinks it is good. We cannot \npass it tonight, but I think we have to have a better system of help \nfor Americans who get caught in storms, tornadoes, earthquakes, or, for \nheaven's sake, a terrorist attack. The system we have in place is not \nworking: $62 billion to FEMA, $43 billion sits in a bank. Nobody is \ngetting money. Nobody is getting help. People are stuck in hotels. \nThere is no plan for housing. I could go on and on.\n  We need to do better. I will withdraw this amendment at this time, \nbut we will offer it again to give people hope, 6 months of a break \nuntil they can figure out whether they can rebuild, come back, or move \nto another place.\n  I thank my colleagues for their patience.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we need to see the amendments from Senator \nLandrieu. I believe with modifications we can accept them. If she would \nshare them with us, we would be happy to do that.\n  I would ask my colleagues, the Senator from Vermont and the Senator \nfrom Minnesota, about the time they will need. They have an amendment I \nwould love to be able to accept, providing more money for CDBG and \nother worthwhile activities. Unfortunately, there is not money to \nrescind. We were presented with a major rescission package by the \nadministration, but neither the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment nor the Office of Management and Budget could justify any \nof those rescissions. We have taken the maximum rescissions we believe \nare feasible. This additional funding for CDBG is predicated on \nproviding more offsets, plus it is $200 million above the budget. I \nregret that I will have to raise a Budget Act point of order. I ask \nwhat time limit they would need to speak on this amendment. I regret I \nmust tell them that I will have to raise a Budget Act point of order.\n  May I inquire through the Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will tell the distinguished senior \nSenator from Missouri, first off, that he and the distinguished senior \nSenator from Washington State have been doing a wonderful job in moving \nthis bill. It is a difficult bill. I know. I have watched it being put \ntogether in the Appropriations Committee. I know the two of them have \nworked extraordinarily hard. I mean to commend them, whether the \ndistinguished Senator supports me and the Senator from Minnesota or not \nin our bipartisan amendment, number 2157, to restore funding to the \nCommunity Development Block Grants, Section 8 Housing Vouchers, and \nPublic Housing Capital and Operating Funds. I think all of us should \ncommend them for the work they have done and want to work with them to \nlook for alternatives that will make our amendment acceptable to them. \nI suggest the absence of a quorum. I think the chairman will probably \nbe pleased that I do.\n  Mr. BOND. If the Senator will withhold, the Senator from Louisiana is \nprepared to offer another amendment.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I am not going to offer another amendment. I just \nwanted to offer the amendment to be placed in the Record and withdraw \nit because I have already spoken about it. I thank the managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has been printed in the Record.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while we have the distinguished senior \nSenator from Missouri and the distinguished senior Senator from \nWashington and the distinguished Senator from Minnesota on the floor, \nlet me propose this: We could spend the next several hours on our \nbipartisan amendment to restore funding to the Community Development \nBlock Grants, Section 8 Housing Vouchers, and Public Housing Capital \nand Operating Funds, and there are enough of our 40 bipartisan \ncosponsors willing to speak that it would take several hours to do it. \nWe would then end up on a 60-vote point of order, which may or may not \ngo through. I know from nearly 30 years on the Appropriations Committee \nhow it works. I have watched for decades the work of the distinguished \nSenator from Missouri and the distinguished Senator from Washington \nState. I know how hard both of them have worked to accommodate the \nneeds of Senators from both sides of the aisle, and certainly in this \ncase, when the key cosponsors are both Republican and Democrat. I see \nmy friend from Minnesota on the floor. I have truly appreciated all the \nwork Senator Coleman, Senator Sarbanes, Senator Graham and Senator Reed \nhave put into crafting this amendment with me. I also thank our 35 \nother cosponsors, who strike a broad swath of the political spectrum. \nMight I suggest this, though: That we withhold our amendment and work \nto ensure that in conference we increase funds for these important \ncommunity development and housing programs. I am on Appropriations. The \nSenator from Missouri is as well, of course, as is the Senator from \nWashington State. With Senator Coleman, we are all agreed on the need \nfor Community Development Block Grant Programs, Section 8, HUD public \nhousing. Between now and the time of conference, we will work closely \ntogether with the leaders of the Transportation-Treasury-HUD \nAppropriations subcommittee to see if we can increase these various \nareas. Would that make sense to the distinguished chairman?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the suggestion of my friend from Vermont is \na very good one. I think he knows--and he serves on our committee--that \ntrying to fund these very vital programs is a top priority of my \nranking member and of mine. We are in a position where we have not been \nable to identify any more dollars. We will look forward to working with \nthem and their staffs. We will work in conference with the House to try \nto add money because these are high-priority programs. Community \ndevelopment block grants, public housing, Section 8, these are vitally \nimportant. Right now we can't find them. I would be put in a very \nawkward spot of having to raise a Budget Act point of order. I would \nappreciate the opportunity to work with the Senator from Vermont, the \nSenator from Minnesota, and other Senators. I know I speak for my \ncolleague from Washington. We will work with the other original \ncosponsors of this amendment to try to accomplish that. I thank him \nvery much for his understanding and willingness to work with us.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have worked with both the Senators from \nMissouri and Washington State for years. I know they have commitments \nto all these programs and have always worked in a bipartisan way. I \nwould be willing to accept those assurances. I ask my chief cosponsor, \nthe Senator from Minnesota, how he feels about this commitment from the \nchairman and ranking member of the TTHUD Appropriations subcommittee?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, the champions of CDBG and Section 8 are \nthe ranking member and chairman of the committee. We are in an awkward \nposition. We are all trying to get to the same place. I accept those \nassurances. These programs are vitally important.

Mr. President, I rise to enter into a \ncolloquy with Senator DeWine to discuss an amendment that we were going \nto offer on behalf of our Nation's disabled veterans and other persons \nwith disabilities.\n  I know that we are all concerned about taking care of our returning \nservice men and women, especially those who were wounded in action and \nare now disabled, some severely. The amendment that was to be offered \ntoday would have immediately increased employment of the disabled while \npotentially saving taxpayer money.\n  In October 2004, Congress enacted the American Jobs Creation Act of \n2004, providing for outsourcing by the IRS of collection of unpaid and \npast due Federal income taxes. The administrative process for issuing \ncontracts to qualified private sector debt collection companies is \nabout to be completed. It is estimated that these contracts will create \nup to 4,000, well paying private sector jobs.\n  If the same tax collection activities were conducted by Federal \nemployees, provisions of current law would give preferences in \nemployment to disabled veterans in filling those Federal jobs. In \naddition, if other persons with disabilities were employed by the \nFederal Government in those jobs, those disabled persons would benefit \nfrom the Federal Government's long history of nondiscrimination and \npolicies of promoting job opportunities for the disabled. By enacting \nlegislation to improve the IRS's tax collection efforts and placing \nthose efforts on a sound commercial footing by outsourcing or \nprivatizing the initiative, Congress certainly did not intend to \ncurtail the national commitment to creating meaningful job \nopportunities for disabled veterans and other persons with \ndisabilities. Indeed, the contracts which the IRS will soon execute \nwith private sector debt collection companies provide a unique \nopportunity for the Federal Government to stimulate creation of well \npaying jobs for disabled veterans and other persons with disabilities.\n  To realize this opportunity, however, Congress must act to assure \nthat existing Federal employment preferences for disabled veterans and \nFederal policies promoting opportunities for other disabled persons are \ncarried forward as a part of the IRS's contracting criteria.\n  The language in the proposed amendment would have established a \npreference under the debt collection contracting program for \ncontractors who meet certain threshold criteria relating to employment \nof disabled veterans and other disabled persons. Furthermore, the \namendment would have required that at least a specified percentage of \nthe individuals employed by the contractor to provide debt collection \nservices under the contract with the IRS qualify as disabled veterans \nor disabled persons.\n  Some have expressed concern over this proposed amendment because they \nbelieve this could possibly derail the selection process currently \nunderway.\n  It is not my intention to stall this process, but rather to make it \nbetter. As such, I have chosen not to offer the language at this time. \nBut it is my intention to find the appropriate legislative vehicle for \nlanguage mandating the hiring of persons with disabilities \nprospectively.\n\n[[Page S11643]]\n\n  I wish to ask the Senator from Ohio to work with me on this very \nimportant matter.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am happy to join my friend from Nebraska \nin bringing this very important issue to the attention of the Senate.\n  As my good friend has mentioned, the provisions contained in the \nAmerican Jobs Creation Act of 2004 have created a unique opportunity to \nadvance the futures of returning patriots and other persons with \ndisabilities, while improving the fiscal outlook of our country.\n  A little over a year ago, the U.S. Army established the Disabled \nSoldiers Support System, or DS3, to provide its ``disabled Soldiers and \ntheir families with a system of advocacy and follow-up to provide \npersonal support that assists them in their transition from military \nservice into the civilian community.'' The program has been combined \nwith the Recovery and Employment Assistance Lifelines, or REALifelines, \ninitiative as a joint project of the U.S. Department of Labor, the \nBethesda Naval Medical Center, and the Walter Reed Army Medical Center. \nThe joint effort aims to create a seamless, personalized assistance \nnetwork to ensure that seriously wounded and injured servicemembers who \ncannot return to active duty are trained for rewarding new careers in \nthe private sector.\n  In employing the new private debt collection provisions of the \nAmerican Jobs Creation Act, private collection agencies would be in the \nunique position of being able to provide these veterans with well-\npaying and challenging jobs. Studies in the Worker's Compensation \nindustry point to heightened degrees of vocational success when return \nto work efforts occur early. It is important that our returning \ndisabled servicemembers be reincorporated into a stable work \nenvironment as soon as possible so that they do not become depressed \nand develop feelings of uselessness.\n  As the Senator has stated, some have expressed concern due to the \nselection process currently underway. Therefore, I agree with him that \nit is best not to offer this language at this time.\n  But notwithstanding, Senator Nelson of Nebraska and I plan to work to \nfind the appropriate legislative vehicle to attach language that will \nmandate the hiring of persons with disabilities prospectively. I urge \nmy fellow Senators to join me in supporting this effort. This is an \ninnovative and cost-effective plan for increasing employment of \ndisabled veterans and other disabled citizens. We owe it to our service \nmen and women to improve their futures any way we can.\n\n\n              setaside funding for public housing agencies\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the \nchairman and ranking member of the Transportation-HUD Appropriations \nSubcommittee. There has already been much discussion about the critical \nrole of the section 8 program in providing millions of Americans with \naffordable, safe housing. As my colleagues know, the 2005 funding year \nbudget is based on a ``snapshot'' of verified VMS leasing and cost data \naveraged for the months of May, June, and July of 2004. I commend the \nchairman and ranking member for including a setaside of $45 million in \nthe Senate bill to adjust the allocations of the housing agencies whose \nsnapshot did not accurately reflect the real leasing levels and costs \nfor 2004.\n  Unfortunately, the provision as drafted does not take into account \nreduced leasing levels resulting from the public housing agency: One, \nfollowing HUD directives to not reissue turnover vouchers, two, \naccepting 1,000 or more additional vouchers through Housing Conversion \nActions or enhanced vouchers, or three, accepting assigned vouchers/\nvoucher portfolios from other public housing authorities. Without these \nadditional criteria, many public housing agencies, including the \nMichigan State Housing Development Authority, will be unfair1y denied \nany of the setaside funding that is provided under this bill to make \nthem whole. I urge the chairman and ranking member to improve this \nprovision in conference to provide for a fairer distribution of this \nsetaside funding.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan and concur with her that this is a problem that must be \naddressed in conference. I will work with the Senator from Michigan to \nensure that the final conference report includes a fair distribution of \nthis setaside funding for public housing agencies. As you know, we \nincluded a provision to protect the use of project-based vouchers in \nthe distribution formula.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator bringing this \nissue to our attention and she can be sure that her concerns will be \ngiven every consideration in conference.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the distinguished chairman and ranking member \nof the subcommittee.\n\n\njudicial resources for the u.s. district court for the district of new \n                                 mexico\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the pending \nTransportation, Treasury, Judiciary and HUD Appropriations bill for \nfiscal year 2006. I would like to discuss the special needs of the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of New Mexico due to its \ndisproportionately heavy caseload.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman of the Transportation, Treasury, \nJudiciary and HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Bond, and the \ndistinguished ranking member, Senator Murray, for their willingness to \naddress the difficulties faced by courts on the United States-Mexico \nBorder due to lack of resources. This issue is one of great importance \nto the citizens of New Mexico.\n  The District Courts along the United States-Mexico border face \nparticularly pressing needs as they must deal with many immigration \nissues in addition to the typical cases filed in federal court. For \nexample, for the 12-month period ending September 30, 2004, 364 felony \ncases per judge were filed in the District of New Mexico, compared to \nthe national average of 88 cases per judge. The Las Cruces, NM \ndivision, which deals with a significant number of Spanish speakers, \ncurrently has only one staff interpreter to support five judges and \nmagistrates. District judges from across the state travel to Las Cruces \nweekly to help manage the over-crowded docket in the southern part of \nthe State, so they need additional travel funds. Finally, courtroom \ntechnology, such as video conferencing equipment, is needed to allow \njudges to hear motions without traveling across the State.\n  May I inquire of the distinguished chairman if it is the intention of \nthe subcommittee to encourage the Administrative Office of the Courts, \nas they prepare their funding formula for the distribution of fiscal \nyear 2006 funds, to take into account the above mentioned special needs \nof the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico is correct. The \nU.S. Court for the District of New Mexico faces an extraordinary need \nfor interpreters, travel funds for judges, and improved courtroom \ntechnology, and I ask the Administrative Office of the Courts to \nconsider these necessities in their allocation of fiscal year 2006 \nfunds.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I agree with the distinguished Senator from Missouri and \nrequest that the needs of the U.S. Court for the District of New Mexico \nbe considered by the Administrative Office of the Courts. I have also \nbeen made aware of these concerns earlier in the year by the other \nSenator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank my colleagues for their concurrence regarding \nthe special circumstances and requirements of the U.S. District Court \nfor the District of New Mexico. I also thank the chairman for his \nwillingness to attempt to address this issue in conference.\n\n\n   FEDERAL FUNDS FOR DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA RESIDENT TUITION ASSISTANCE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly about a \nparticular Federal funding provision in the appropriations measure for \nthe District of Columbia, which has been fully incorporated as part of \nthis bill. The bill provides $33.2 million in Federal funds for the \nDistrict of Columbia Resident Tuition Assistance Program, also known as \nDC TAG.\n  The District of Columbia Resident Tuition Assistance Program provides \nfunds which allow eligible District students to attend out-of-State \npublic colleges and universities at in-State tuition rates. It also \nprovides stipends for District students to attend private Historically \nBlack Colleges and Universities, HBCUs, across the country and\n\n[[Page S11644]]\n\nprivate colleges in the District of Columbia metropolitan region.\n  I have had a long-standing interest in this program. I recall a \nmeeting in my office in early 1999 with Donald Graham of The Washington \nPost. He was spearheading an effort to involve the Congress in creating \nand funding a program to work in tandem with a successful program that \nlocal business leaders established in the local schools to provide \nguidance to students exploring post-secondary educational \nopportunities. I was impressed with the concept and pledged to help get \nit done.\n  As ranking member of the District of Columbia oversight subcommittee, \nI worked closely with Senator Voinovich in shepherding through to \nenactment the legislation that initially established this program, the \nDistrict of Columbia College Access Act of 1999. Then as subcommittee \nchairman in 2001, I worked to ensure that the District of Columbia \nCollege Access Improvement Act of 2002 to expand and strengthen the \nprogram was signed into law. More recently, I was an original cosponsor \nof bipartisan legislation last year to reauthorize the program.\n  This unique program has enjoyed remarkable success. District \nofficials are to be commended for their efforts to quickly launch and \nimplement the program within a short period following its \nauthorization. The fact that the Federal funds have enabled over 8,000 \nDistrict residents to achieve their dream of attending college at some \ninstitutions in 46 states is extraordinary.\n  Yet despite my long-standing, ongoing support for the TAG program and \nits continued viability, I do have significant concerns. These are not \nnew.\n  First, this Program's source of revenue for its operation is strictly \nand wholly a Federal contribution. There are--and have been--no non-\nFederal funds invested in the Program. While the Mayor can be proud of \nhow much it has accomplished in the past six years, there is no \ndemonstrated financial commitment to it on the part of the local \nDistrict government.\n  Secondly, in the past 2 fiscal years, this program has enjoyed a \nsignificant boost in annual funding. In FY 2005, the President \nrequested $17 million, the equivalent level Congress provided in each \nof the previous five years. However, the District sought $25.6 million. \nThe fact that the District at the time appeared to also have some $9 \nmillion in unspent reserve funds prompted me to amend the Senate bill \nin committee to provide for $21.2 million, with a directive that the \nDistrict use the reserve funds to fully fund the program in fiscal year \n2005 and work with the Senate and House authorizing and appropriations \nCommittees to develop a plan involving Federal/non-Federal cost sharing \nfor DC TAG for future fiscal years. The conference ultimately approved \nthe full $25.6 million.\n  Now this year, the proposed funding level for fiscal year 2006 of \n$33.2 million represents a 30 percent increase over the $25.6 million \nallowed for fiscal year 2005, which itself represented a 52 percent \nhike over the $17 million appropriated for fiscal year 2004. In \nresponse to questions I raised seeking further explanation and \njustification for this increase, Mayor Anthony Williams sent me his \nwritten assurance that ``the last two years' requests for significant \nappropriations increase will not occur again.'' I ask unaminous consent \nthat a copy of the Mayor's letter of July 20, 2005 be printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1)\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I also note that 2 years ago, the Congress \ndirected the Government Accountability Office to evaluate the DC TAG \nprogram to determine whether adequate controls are in place to protect \nthe Federal interest, such as those pertaining to student eligibility, \ncash management, and administrative expenses, as well as assess \nrelevant performance and demographic information.\n  I understand that the GAO's work on this mandated study may be in its \nfinal stages, and that a written report is anticipated soon. To the \nextent that GAO identifies any particular concerns which may put the DC \nTAG program and the Federal taxpayer dollars it receives at risk, I \nwould urge that in response, the Mayor take immediate steps to promptly \ncorrect any identified weaknesses in the operations and financial \nmanagement of the program, and advise the Congress of the District's \nplans and outcomes.\n  Additionally, to the extent that the GAO findings and recommendations \nare available in advance of the conference on this bill, I would \nrecommend that the conference agreement include explicit directives to \nthe Mayor and other appropriate District officials to address the GAO \nfindings in order to help bolster the future fiscal management of this \nprogram without inordinate delay.\n  Furthermore, it would be prudent, prior to our consideration of the \nFY 2007 funding request for this program, that the District of Columbia \nappropriations subcommittee conduct a comprehensive oversight hearing \non the DC TAG program. This could provide a forum to not only showcase \nthe program's accomplishments and strengths, but to identify any \nweaknesses in the fiscal operations, program policies, and managerial \nstructure which affect the efficient and effective use of Federal \nfunds. It may afford an opportunity to collaborate with the authorizing \ncommittee to ensure that any necessary legislative and administrative \nreforms can be instituted. Any efforts we can take to improve this \nprogram as it matures and continues to benefit District residents in \ntheir educational pursuits will be time well spent.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                    July 20, 2005.\n     Hon. Richard J. Durbin,\n     Subcommittee on the District of Columbia, Senate Committee on \n         Appropriations, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Durbin: I would like to thank you for your \n     long history of support for the District of Columbia Tuition \n     Assistance Grant Program (DCTAG). As a result of your \n     leadership for both the authorization and significant \n     appropriations for this most beneficial program, DCTAG has \n     helped more than 8,000 students throughout the District of \n     Columbia attend college.\n       The program's success has necessarily and predictably \n     resulted in rising costs and I acknowledge your concerns \n     about the rate of growth in program costs over the last two \n     years. Moreover, I acknowledge your concerns about our \n     current out-year cost projections. I can assure you that the \n     last two years' requests for significant appropriations \n     increase will not occur again. These increases were largely \n     the result of two factors: 1) the program's annual carryover \n     is virtually depleted meaning that we must request the actual \n     operating costs (rather than relying, in part, on carryover \n     surpluses) and 2) the program has been adding entire classes \n     of students during its implementation phase (and we no longer \n     will be adding new cohorts or categories of newly eligible \n     persons.)\n       As Mayor, I am committed to undertaking measures to reduce \n     the current cost projections in FY 07 and beyond, including: \n     Negotiating tuition decreases based upon volume of students; \n     aligning program requirements in line with those of the U.S. \n     Department of Education; and revising maximum award \n     calculations based on type of school.\n       Program officials have already discussed these scenarios \n     with the authorizers and after appropriate consultation with \n     you and others, we will begin to implement a range of cost \n     containment measures. Attached is a copy of my testimony last \n     month before the DC appropriations subcommittee which \n     reiterates this commitment.\n       I once again thank you for support of the DCTAG program. \n     This program has had a demonstrable impact on the quality of \n     life for thousands of District families, Were it not for this \n     program, the dream of a college education would not be a \n     reality for many of these families. My staff and I are eager \n     to continue our partnership with you and your staff in the \n     management of this program to the benefit of the citizens of \n     the District of Columbia.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Anthony A. Williams,\n                                                            Mayor.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I like to thank the Senator from \nIllinois, Mr. Durbin, for his concerted oversight of the DC Tuition \nAssistance Grant Program. This program is an important aspect of \nCongress's investment in educational opportunities for DC students. I \nappreciate Senator Durbin's insight into the management of the program \nas he brings to our appropriations subcommittee on the District the \nperspective of the authorizing committee on which he served as well.\n  As Senator Durbin noted, Congress engaged the Government \nAccountability Office to conduct a comprehensive review of the Tuition \nAssistance Grant Program--TAG--in 2004. We understand this report is \nforthcoming and are eager to review these findings with our colleagues. \nThis unique program was created to fit the unique need that\n\n[[Page S11645]]\n\nthe District of Columbia does not have a public university system \nsimilar to states across the country. TAG supports the opportunity for \nDC students to have choices to further their education in small or \nlarge universities around the country. The program has been lauded as a \nsignificant tool for increasing college attendance, but I am \nparticularly interested to learn from the GAO the college graduation \nrates of TAG recipients. This, and answers many other questions, will \nenable the authorizers and appropriators to continually examine this \nprogram for performance.\n  As a unique program, tailored to the needs of the District, we also \nmust ensure the program is meeting the goals set out by the Congress \nand the needs of the community. We understand the GAO has found that \nseveral management and financial controls are lacking. Because we have \nlimited resources every program must be responsive to the community and \noperate in an accountable and rigorous manner. I am encouraged by the \nrecent management improvements Mayor Williams has made, but as Senator \nDurbin noted, there is still work to be done.\n  I appreciate Senator Durbin raising these important concerns to \nChairman Brownback and me. I will work with the other conferees to \nensure that funding for the TAG program meets the current need in the \ncommunity, and that proper controls are in place for strict management \nof these funds. In addition, I welcome an opportunity for the Committee \nto examine the TAG program in our hearings next spring. I hope we are \nable to collaborate with the authorization committee so we may continue \nto manage and fund this program to generate the best benefit for all DC \nstudents attending college.\n  Senator Durbin, I thank you for bringing these recommendations to our \nattention.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the pending Departments of Transportation, \nTreasury, HUD, the Judiciary and Related Agencies appropriations bill \nfor fiscal year 2006, H.R. 3058, as reported by the Senate Committee on \nAppropriations provides $84.806 billion in budget authority and \n$141.037 billion in outlays in fiscal year 2006. Of these totals, \n$18.987 billion in budget authority and $18.973 billion in outlays are \nfor mandatory programs in fiscal year 2006.\n  The bill provides total discretionary budget authority in fiscal yer \n2006 of $65.819 billion. This amount is $5.689 billion more than the \nPresident's request, equal to the 302(b) allocations adopted by the \nSenate and $47 million less than fiscal year 2005 enacted levels. This \nlegislation is also equal to the 302(b) outlay allocation.\n  For the information of my colleagues, I must note that this \nlegislation contains several provisions that will result in spending in \n2007 and subsequent years. I must inform my colleagues that the \nprovisions creating these advance appropriations would be subject to a \nbudget point of order under section 401(b) of the 2006 budget \nresolution. It is my hope that these problems can be addressed by the \nbill managers so that we will not have to consider points of order \nagainst this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of the bill be inserted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      H.R. 3058, 2006 TRANSPORTATION, TREASURY, JUDICIARY, AND HUD\n       APPROPRIATIONS--SPENDING COMPARISONS--SENATE-REPORTED BILL\n                     [Fiscal Year 2006, $ millions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     General\n                                     purpose     Mandatory      Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n    Budget authority.............       65,819       18,987       84,806\n    Outlays......................      122,064       18,973      141,037\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget authority.............       65,819       18,987       84,806\n    Outlays......................      122,064       18,973      141,037\n2005 Enacted:\n    Budget authority.............       65,866       18,580       84,446\n    Outlays......................      116,866       18,532      135,398\nPresident's request:\n    Budget authority.............       60,130       18,987       79,117\n    Outlays......................      119,218       18,973      138,191\nHouse-passed bill: \\1\\\n    Budget authority.............       66,934       18,987       85,921\n    Outlays......................      120,949       18,973      139,922\n \nSenate-Reported Bill Compared To:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget authority.............            0            0            0\n    Outlays......................            0            0            0\n2005 Enacted:\n    Budget authority.............          -47          407          360\n    Outlays......................        5,198          441        5,639\nPresident's request:\n    Budget authority.............        5,689            0        5,689\n    Outlays......................        2,846            0        2,846\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ House and Senate bills having different jurisdictions.\n \nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nTransportation/Treasury/HUD appropriations bill and my trade amendment \nthat was adopted by unanimous consent this morning. This amendment will \nsend a strong signal to our major Asian trading partners that we are no \nlonger going to tolerate their trade violations that are costing us \njobs here at home--especially in my State of Michigan.\n  As my colleagues may know, Treasury Secretary Snow has been traveling \nin China for the last week to advance a trip that President Bush is \ntaking to China and Japan in November. Unfortunately, he seems to be \nmaking little progress in our attempt to get China to stop its illegal \ntrade practices like currency manipulation.\n  The President's upcoming trip could not come at a more important \ntime. Currently, Chinese and Japanese trade policies are literally \ndestroying U.S. industries, costing us jobs and hurting our middle-\nclass families.\n  In order to help President Bush as he pushes China and Japan to stop \ntheir currency manipulation, to crack down on the counterfeiting of \nAmerican manufactured goods, and to cease the pirating of intellectual \nproperty, I believe the Senate should go on record to show that our \nGovernment is united in opposition to these illegal trade practices.\n  Just last week, Delphi, our Nation's largest auto parts supplier, \ndeclared bankruptcy, threatening 15,000 jobs in Michigan and more than \n33,000 across the country.\n  In terms of assets, this bankruptcy is the largest ever in the United \nStates, surpassing the reorganizations of K-Mart and Worldcom.\n  The Delphi bankruptcy should serve as a wake up call to the Congress \nand the administration that we can no longer tolerate unfair trade \npractices. Unless we put a stop to them, our economic spiral downward \nwill continue and the American middle class way of life will be in \njeopardy.\n  In Michigan, we are experts at many things, but we excel at making \nthings and growing things.\n  Whether it is cars or office furniture, apples or cherries, we lead \nthe way in manufacturing innovation and efficiency.\n  And manufacturing jobs are the life blood of almost every community \nin Michigan.\n  Even though Michigan has growing, cutting-edge industries, such as \nbiotechnology and nanotechnology, it still has one of the highest \nunemployment rates in the country because of our troubled manufacturing \nsector.\n  Our current economy is moving through a period of great uncertainty. \nIt would be easy to blame this on a particularly bad business cycle--a \nbusiness cycle that will eventually correct itself. But, to do so would \nrequire us to overlook a very real threat to our economy and our way of \nlife.\n  That threat is the lack of a level playing field for American \nbusinesses and workers in the global marketplace.\n  As my colleagues know, China currently exports to the United States \nsome $160 billion more than it takes in.\n  A significant portion of this deficit is driven by consumer demand \nhere in the United States, but a shockingly large portion of it is due \nto illegal trade practices, namely currency manipulation, \ncounterfeiting and the theft of intellectual property.\n  Since 1995 China has pegged its currency and has not allowed it to \n``float.''\n  The impact of this illegal action is clear. It gives a distinct \nadvantage to Chinese companies that export into the United States and \ndiminishes our ability to export to the Chinese market--therefore, \nChina is effectively giving its exporters an exchange rate subsidy.\n  This manipulation increases the price of our goods while making their \ngoods appear cheaper here at home.\n  For example, a mid-sized American car sold in China or Japan is \n$2,000 more expensive than it should be because of currency \nmanipulation. This really hurts our automobile industry.\n  Earlier this year, I spoke with employees of a large auto parts \nsupplier who told me they had recently lost a parts contract to a \nChinese company despite the fact that they were the lowest bidder.\n  The reason: when you factored in the impact of the artificially low \nyuan, the Chinese company had a cheaper bid.\n\n[[Page S11646]]\n\n  As we all know, such currency manipulation is illegal under the terms \nof China's International Monetary Fund and World Trade Organization \nmembership.\n  Some economists have calculated that this price differential may \namount to as much as 40 percent. It is simply devastating our \nmanufacturers in Michigan and it is costing us jobs everyday.\n  In July, China announced that it would stop pegging its currency, but \nafter rising 2 percent on July 21, the yuan has barely budged.\n  This is an unacceptable situation that calls for immediate action.\n  I think it is important to note, though, this is not just a China \nproblem. This is a pan-Asian problem that includes Japan among the \noffenders.\n  Unfortunately, currency manipulation is not the only illegal trade \npractice we need to address.\n  Chinese counterfeiting and Intellectual property theft are enormous \nproblems for manufacturing in my home State of Michigan.\n  Let me give two examples of the problem that we in Michigan currently \nface with regard to this unfair competition.\n  Counterfeit automotive products not only kill American jobs, they \nhave the potential to kill American families--when shoddy counterfeit \nautomotive products replace legitimate ones of higher-quality our \nmanufacturers lose, and our consumers are put at risk.\n  The Federal Trade Commission estimates that the automotive parts and \ncomponents industry loses an estimated $12 billion annually in sales on \na global basis to counterfeiting.\n  It is estimated that if these losses were eliminated, and those sales \nwere brought into legitimate companies, the automotive industry could \nhire 200,000 additional workers.\n  And we don't even keep statistics on the potential loss of life--when \nshoddy counterfeit auto parts fail and cause car accidents.\n  We should understand that, if left unchecked, penetration by \ncounterfeit automotive products, as well as other manufactured goods, \nhas the potential to undermine the public's confidence and trust in \nwhat they are buying. We can't let that happen.\n  The second example I want to share involves a small manufacturer \nlocated in western Michigan.\n  Peter Perez is the president of Carter Products Company located in \nGrand Rapids. He is also the national president of the Wood Machinery \nManufacturers of America.\n  Carter Products employs 15 people and holds numerous patents--one of \nwhich belongs to this small piece of equipment--the Carter Stabilizer \nGuide.\n  It is used to support a band saw blade in such a way as to allow for \na wood worker to make nearly any type of angled cut.\n  Shortly after introducing the Stabilizer--the product, its \ninstallation instructions, and instruction photos were copied by a \nChinese company and resold into the American market.\n  Under normal circumstances, the Stabilizer would cost a retail \ncustomer about $70. The pirated product was being sold for less than \n$10--which is far below the cost of the raw materials necessary to \ncreate the product.\n  Carter Products had to launch a case at its own expense to stop this \nillegal trade violation. After spending more than $20,000 the company \nwas able to keep the illegal product out of the U.S. market by stopping \nits distribution in markets covered by the company's patents.\n  But what company can ever be sure that they have achieved victory \nagainst this type of illegal behavior if the country of origin--in this \ncase China--is not going to abide by their obligations under the WTO?\n  Second only to our human resources, intellectual property is our \nNation's most valuable asset. As the United States freely trades with \nthe world's nations, we are discovering new opportunities and new \nchallenges.\n  International rules and institutions have been set up to protect \nintellectual property, but China falls short when it comes to following \nthose rules and keeping their commitments.\n  They are seeking to gain an advantage over American companies and \nAmerican workers by breaking the rules. In April, I proposed bipartisan \nlegislation to strengthen our Government's ability to protect the \nrights of American companies and American workers in world markets; \nthat includes protection of our intellectual property rights. The Chief \nTrade Prosecutor Act should be passed into law immediately so we may \ndefend our companies and workers from those who seek to gain an \nadvantage by breaking the rules.\n  It is time to send a message to the Chinese and Japanese governments. \nIt is time to say we are fed up and we will not take it anymore. Let's \ngive them a shot across the bow. Let's make it loud and clear that they \nwill have to change now--not later--or we will take real action against \nthem.\n  Workers across the country are losing their job. For their sake and \nfor those who are clinging to their jobs, let's stand up to the Chinese \nand Japanese governments and stand up for our working families.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as this bill now moves to conference with \nthe House, I strongly urge our Senate conferees to reject an \nunfortunate amendment adopted by the House prohibiting the allocation \nof any funds for the District of Columbia to enforce its firearms \nregistration law and its requirement for DC residents to keep their \nfirearms unloaded and disassembled, or bound by a trigger lock. In \neffect, the House amendment would repeal the DC Government's \nlongstanding ban on firearms and would be a disastrous blow to gun \nsafety in the District. For almost three decades, DC's ban on handguns \nand assault weapons bans have helped reduce the risk of deadly handgun \nviolence. City residents and public officials overwhelmingly support \nthe ban, and the courts have upheld it. Representative Eleanor Holmes \nNorton, Mayor Anthony Williams, and Police Chief Charles Ramsey all \nstrongly oppose the House amendment.\n  Mayor Williams has called this effort to repeal the city's gun ban \n``a slap in the face.'' Chief Ramsey has said that a repeal of DC's gun \nban would have a ``scary'' impact. Without question, more guns mean \nmore violence. More than half of the robberies and 20 percent of the \naggravated assaults in the city are committed with a firearm. In 2004, \nnearly 80 percent of District homicides were committed with firearms. \nThe youngest victim was only 7 years old.\n  It is difficult to understand how weaker gun safety laws will make \nresidents and visitors safer. This effort by Congress to prevent the \nenforcement of the DC gun laws will only serve to increase the number \nof homicides, suicides and accidental shootings. Greater availability \nof firearms will make it more likely that deadly handgun violence will \nerupt in public buildings, offices, and public spaces. Over 20 million \nvisitors come to Washington each year, and this amendment puts the \nsafety of all of them at needless risk.\n  The amendment is also an attack upon the well-established principle \nof home rule for the District. It tramples the rights of the city's \nelected leaders and local residents to govern their homes, streets, \nneighborhoods, and workplaces. It is an insult to the 600,000 citizens \nof the District of Columbia.\n  Statistics show that crime prevention is working in the District. \nCrime decreased 18 percent last year and homicides went down 17 \npercent. In the first 5 months of 2005, the Metropolitan Police \nDepartment confiscated more than 1,000 firearms on city streets. Only a \ntiny percentage of recovered firearms are registered in the District. \nThe city continues to face serious concerns about firearms illegally \nbrought into the city from other jurisdictions, and the House amendment \nwould unfairly limit the ability of DC officials to combat this \nproblem.\n  Congress should respect the public safety efforts of this city's \nleaders and let the District decide what firearm regulations are best \nfor its citizens. I urge my colleagues to oppose this reckless, \nspecial-interest amendment that will endanger the safety of all who \nlive or work or visit here.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleagues \nSenators Thune and Collins, in support of an amendment to the \nTransportation, Treasury and Housing and Urban Development \nappropriations bill. I would like to commend the managers on both sides \nof the aisle for their efforts to shepherd along this extremely vital \nlegislation to passage in the Senate.\n\n[[Page S11647]]\n\nThey have shown a great eagerness to work with Senators to improve the \noverall legislation, and have done so in a sincerely bipartisan way \nthat is so rarely seen in the Senate nowadays.\n  This amendment will offer some small measure of protection to \nemployees at our flight service stations scattered across the country. \nIn Bangor, ME, our flight service station, highly skilled workers \ndecipher flight plans and help pilots navigate the tricky summer fog of \ncoastal Maine and the constantly changing winter weather.\n  As many of you know, our Nation's flight service stations have been \ncontracted to Lockheed-Martin. While some may dispute the wisdom of \nsuch a decision, I do not come to the floor to discuss that issue. I \ndo, however, wish to prevent unforeseen and serious damage to the \nfinancial future of many of our employees who have so diligently and \nskillfully protected our pilots and aviators for so many years.\n  Hundreds of flight service station employees who are years, months, \nor in some cases weeks away from a well-deserved retirement would be, \nif not protected, stripped of their Federal pensions and benefits as \nthe stations are transferred over to Lockheed-Martin. The aerospace \ncompany has operated in good faith, there can be no disputing that, but \nmany of these individuals have been counting the days until their \nretirement, complete with the Federal benefits they have so rightly \nearned. To take those away from them, with but a few weeks to spare, is \nquite obviously cruel and uncalled for.\n  This amendment would allow those workers who are eligible for \nretirement in 2 years or less to remain on the Federal Aviation \nAdministration's payroll, to retire at the end of those 2 years, and \nreceive the Federal retirement benefits they have worked so long to \nearn. This cost will be offset by reducing the payout of the contract \nto Lockheed-Martin.\n  For years, pilots have been clamoring for better technology in our \nflight service stations, and Lockheed will do an excellent job \nproviding that. What will be missing will be the local knowledge and \neyes on the ground that those same pilots have come to rely on. This \namendment, in its own small way, attempts to honor those individuals \nwho have proven so reliable over the years.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this very simple amendment, and would \nlike to thank Senators Collins, Thune, Johnson, Santorum, and Specter \nfor their steadfast efforts on this amendment as well.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor the amendment that \nSenators Leahy, Coleman, Sarbanes, Graham and Reed have offered to \nprotect funding for three programs critical to working families and \nlow-income communities: the Community Development Block Grant, the \nSection 8 Voucher Program, and the Public Housing Operating and Capital \nFunds.\n  These programs expand opportunities to home ownership for working \nclass families and help communities across the country pursue growth \nthat develops poor communities without pushing out the poor themselves.\n  Let me talk about how each of these programs supports communities of \nhope and opportunity.\n  The Community Development Block Grant, CDBG, program makes it \npossible for our communities to improve their infrastructure, develop \nnew businesses, provide important social services, and rehabilitate \nhomes--all of which translates into expanded opportunity for people.\n  This year, Illinois will receive more than $196 million in CDBG \nfunds. The State-level CDBG program alone has invested more than $33 \nmillion in projects around the State. As a result, 66,000 of my \nconstituents received improved water, sanitary and storm water systems; \nsmall businesses were assisted in creating or retaining more than 1,000 \njobs; and 313 homes in 27 communities were rehabilitated to address \nhealth and safety issues.\n  Cities throughout Illinois also leverage CDBG funds for 2,500 \naffordable housing units, economic development in 70 communities, job \ntraining and placement for nearly 900 low-income residents, and health \ncare services for more than 235,000 people.\n  And beyond being good policy, these programs are fiscally \nresponsible. For the State-level CDBG program, every dollar invested in \nIllinois infrastructure and housing yielded over three additional \ndollars in other private or public investment. That translates into \n$109 million in additional dollars for communities across Illinois. If \nonly all government investments could yield that kind of return.\n  The other economic development programs this amendment would protect \nare funding for the Section 8 Voucher Program and the Public Housing \nOperating and Capital Funds. These two programs form the foundation of \nhousing support in this country for low-income individuals and \nfamilies.\n  Over a million households in Illinois spend more than 30 percent of \ntheir income on rent. The Section 8 program addresses this problem by \nmaking more than 76,000 Housing Choice Vouchers available to Illinois \nresidents each year. But that still leaves 56,000 households in \nIllinois on Section 8 waiting lists, and the lists are getting longer. \nFamilies waiting on Section 8 vouchers are either paying too much of \ntheir income on housing--and too little on food and healthcare--or they \nare joining the ranks of the more than 8 percent of Illinoisans who \nhave experienced homelessness at some point in their lives. This \nsituation is unacceptable, and this amendment begins to address it.\n  The amendment also shores up funding for the Public Housing Operating \nand Capital Funds. Millions of Americans call public housing ``home,'' \nand more than 62 percent of public housing residents are families with \nchildren or elderly households. The operating fund helps these \nresidents by making money available for building maintenance, \nutilities, and the salaries of Public Housing Authority employees. And \nthe capital fund is a critical tool for maintaining housing \ninfrastructure. It helps local housing authorities modernize, \nrehabilitate or replace aging units, thereby assuring that families \nlive in safe homes.\n  Communities and families across my State, and indeed across the \ncountry, depend on these programs to help them move forward. As housing \nstock and infrastructure continues to age, and voucher waiting lists \ncontinue to grow, we cannot afford to take money away from the working \nclass folks who need it most. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am expressing my support of an amendment \nto provide additional funding for the Community Development Block \nGrants, CDBG, Program.\n  I share the concerns of many of my colleagues that some government \nprograms are overreaching and duplicative. I remain committed to goals \nof limiting the size and scope of the Federal Government, but as we \nfulfill this mission, Congress must work to ensure that we continue to \nsupport programs that truly serve the needs of our constituents.\n  CDBG grants have benefited almost 130,000 people in South Carolina \nalone. Further, over ten thousand jobs have been created through CDBG \nprojects. The CDBG program is one of HUD's most successful programs. It \nshould be held up as an example of local communities, coordinating with \ntheir state, to using Federal dollars to foster growth and encourage \ncitizen participation.\n  In listening to community leaders across the state of South Carolina, \nthe CDBG program gives them flexibility to execute plans that \naccurately address their situational needs, which in turn pay great \ndividends for the community. To put it simply, the CDBG program works \nand I am a proud to be an original cosponsor of this amendment.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, we are staring at an approaching disaster. \nAgain, we face a disaster that will largely affect the poor, \nunderprivileged, elderly, and handicapped. Again, it is a disaster that \nwill threaten lives and drive people into bankruptcy. But this time \nCongress can take action to avoid this disaster. The question is will \nwe act?\n  Today the approaching disaster is not a hurricane but high energy \nprices. Estimates are that the costs of heating the average home with \nnatural gas will skyrocket 70 percent over last year in the Midwest. \nThis is on top of the double-digit increases between 2003 and 2004. \nUtility companies in the State of Wisconsin believe that the homeowners \nwill face heating bills in my State that are 40 percent higher than \nlast year. For working families, these dramatic\n\n[[Page S11648]]\n\nincreases come on top of several months of increasing prices at the gas \npump.\n  These high prices will force many to make difficult choices about how \nto spend their money, which bills to pay, and which to avoid. For many, \nthe thermostat will be turned down to dangerous levels, prescriptions \nwill go unfilled, and groceries will not be bought. For many elderly \nfolks, the choice to stay warm will be dangerous, even fatal. Many \ndisabled Americans will endanger their own health in an effort to keep \ntheir bills low.\n  The Federal Low-Income Home Heating Assistance, or LIHEAP, can help \nmake some of these choices easier. LIHEAP is an extremely effective \nprogram that allows low-income people around the country to avoid being \ndelinquent on their heating bills. The problem is that there has not \nbeen a significant increase in the funding of this program for many \nyears, and now the rising prices have made the current funding levels \nunacceptably low. In past years LIHEAP has only been able to help \nroughly 17 percent of the eligible households, but now with rapidly \nrising prices the $2 billion in funding will not even be able to meet \nthat level.\n  Adding $3.1 billion to LIHEAP will allow us to head off this \nimpending catastrophe. I have voted for this amendment before, and I am \nglad to have the opportunity to support it again today. This money is \nabsolutely necessary to keep my constituents safe and warm through the \nlong Wisconsin winter. Without this money more working class people in \nmy State will face high utility bills this winter and utility shutoffs \ncome spring. Until Congress and the administration can figure out some \nway to bring energy prices down, relieving the pressure on low-income \nAmericans should be a top priority.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, families all over this country are going to \npay more to heat their homes this winter than they ever have before. \nThe average heating bill may climb more than $600, and that comes on \ntop of a record increase last winter. This is going to be one of the \nmost expensive winters on record.\n  Last week, the Energy Information Administration, EIA, released its \nShort-Term Energy Outlook. The report shows that families--particularly \nlow-income families and seniors--are facing an increasingly more \nexpensive heating season. According to the EIA, this winter, \nresidential space-heating expenditures are projected to increase for \nall fuel types compared to last year. On average, households heating \nprimarily with natural gas are expected to spend about $350--48 \npercent--more this winter in fuel expenditures. Households heating \nprimarily with heating oil are expected to pay $378--32 percent--more \nthis winter. Households heating primarily with propane can expect to \npay $325--30 percent--more this winter. If our weather is colder than \nusual, expenditures will be significantly higher.\n  Millions of families who simply need to heat their homes are going to \nface prices they cannot afford. They will choose between medicine, \nfood, and warmth. It is a tough choice to make. The National Energy \nAssistance Directors' Association, NEADA, just found that 32 percent of \nfamilies sacrificed medical care; 24 percent failed to make a rent or \nmortgage payment; and 20 percent went without food for at least a day.\n  We must act now.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, I offered a bipartisan amendment with more than 20 \ncosponsors to fully fund the LIHEAP program at $5.1 billion. The \namendment had support from across the country. It was endorsed by \ncommunity groups, Governors, and national organizations, such as the \nAARP, which knows rising energy prices are especially tough on seniors \nliving on a fixed income. And the amount of funding we are seeking is \nequal to the amount authorized in the Energy bill the President has \nsigned into law. That amendment got 50 votes, enough to win, but in the \nend it was defeated on procedural grounds.\n  Senators Reed, Collins, Kennedy, myself and others are back again \nthis week offering the amendment to the Transportation appropriations \nbill. I understand that the leadership can block this amendment \nprocedurally like they did before. I hope they do not. It is \nbipartisan. It is not our preference to attach it to the Transportation \nappropriations bill, but it is our only option for now.\n  I do not want this issue to be political. And so it bothered me when \nI read this week that the White House, which has opposed more funding \nfor LIHEAP, is worried not about high energy prices but about the \npolitics of high energy prices. To the White House this is a political \nproblem--not a problem for working families, seniors, the disabled, and \nmillions of others who will need help during this cold winter. A \nRepublican strategist who works closely with the White House has \nreportedly called winter heating costs ``a sleeper issue.'' Well, it is \ntime the White House wakes up.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the bipartisan Reed-Collins-\nKerry amendment and ensure the total $5.1 billion in emergency funding \nis available for LIHEAP.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I originally filed an amendment that would \nprohibit the use of funds within this appropriations bill for the Debt \nIndicator program. The Debt Indicator program is an acknowledgment from \nthe Internal Revenue Service, IRS, to tax preparers stating whether the \ntaxpayer's refund will be paid or intercepted for Government debts. I \ncontinue to be outraged that the IRS provides the service of the Debt \nIndicator program to predatory refund anticipation loan, RAL, \noriginators while cutting essential services to low-income taxpayers.\n  The Earned Income Tax Credit, EITC, is a refundable Federal income \ntax credit that is of great benefit to low-income working individuals \nand families. Many taxpayers who earn the EITC receive their tax \nrefunds through predatory RALs. The excessive interest rates and fees \ncharged on RALs are not justified because of the short duration of \nthese loans and the minimal risk of repayment that they present. The \nIRS Debt Indicator program further reduces risk by assuring RAL lenders \nthat the taxpayer's refund be issued and thus the loan will be repaid. \nThe EITC was diminished by an estimated $1.75 billion in 1999. I am \nconcerned about the aggressive marketing of RALs in low-income \nneighborhoods where EITC recipients often live. These loans take money \naway from the day-to-day needs of lower-income families.\n  RALs carry little risk because the Debt Indicator program informs the \nlender whether or not an applicant owes Federal, State taxes, child \nsupport, student loans, or other government obligations. This service \nassists the tax preparer in ascertaining applicant ability to obtain \ntheir full refund. In 1995, the use of the debt indicator was suspended \nbecause of massive fraud in e-filed returns with RALs. This suspension \ncaused RAL participation to decline. RAL prices were expected go down \nas a result of the reinstatement of the debt indicator in 1999. \nHowever, this has not occurred. The debt indicator should once again be \nstopped. The IRS should not be facilitating these predatory loans that \nallow tax preparers to reap outrageous profits by exploiting working \nfamilies.\n  H & R Block Chief Executive Officer Frank L. Salizzoni remarked, upon \nthe reinstatement of the debt indicator, that it ``is good news for \nmany of our clients who opt to receive the amount of their refund \nthrough RALs. The IRS program will likely result in substantially lower \nfees for this service.'' This has not happened. According to the \nNational Consumer Law Center's report entitled, ``Corporate Welfare for \nthe RAL Industry: The Debt Indicator, IRS Subsidy, and Tax Fraud,'' \nprices for RALs dipped in 2000, but since then have gone up beyond pre-\ndebt indicator levels. The report also points out that the ``main \neffect of the debt indicator appears to be, not in lowering RAL fees, \nbut in higher RAL profits.''\n  The NCLC report also indicates that the reinstatement of the debt \nindicator ``generates more fraud related to RALs, which the IRS must \nspend enforcement dollars to address.''\n  The debt indicator serves only to facilitate the exploitation of \ntaxpayers. The reinstatement of the debt indicator has not helped \nconsumers to access cheaper RALs nor has it reduced RAL related fraud. \nIf the debt indicator is removed, then the loans become riskier and the \ntax preparers may not aggressively market them among EITC filers. The \nIRS should not be aiding efforts that take the earned benefits away \nfrom low-income families.\n\n[[Page S11649]]\n\n  RALs are extremely short term loans that unnecessarily diminish the \nEITC. There are alternatives to speeding up refunds such as filing \nelectronically or having the refund directly deposited into a bank or \ncredit union account. Using these methods, taxpayers can receive their \nreturns in about 7 to 10 days without paying the high fees associated \nwith RALs.\n  Instead of offering my amendment to prevent the use of funds for the \nDI, I chose to modify my amendment to have the Internal Revenue \nService, along with the National Taxpayer Advocate, study the use of \nthe debt indicator, the debt collection offset practice, and \nrecommendations that could reduce the amount of time required to \ndeliver tax refunds. In addition, the report shall study whether the \ndebt indicator facilitates the use of RALs, evaluate alternatives to \nRALs, and examine the feasibility of debit cards being used to \ndistribute refunds.\n  I look forward to reviewing the results of the study. I welcome the \nopportunity to work with the Internal Revenue Service, the National \nTaxpayer Advocate, and my colleagues to reduce the use of RALs and to \nexpand access to alternative methods of obtaining timely tax refunds. I \nwant to thank Senator Bond and Senator Murray for working with me to \nincorporate this language into the legislation and hope it will be \nmaintained in the conference report through conference negotiations \nwith the other body.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the above-referenced report in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the National Consumer Law Center, June, 2005]\n\n    Corporate Welfare for the RAL Industry: The Debt Indicator, IRS \n                         Subsidy, and Tax Fraud\n\n                            (By Chi Chi Wu)\n\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       The debt indicator is an acknowledgement from the IRS \n     telling tax preparers whether a taxpayer's refund will be \n     paid versus intercepted for government debts. The debt \n     indicator has proven to be a substantial benefit to the \n     refund anticipation loan (RAL) industry, as it about doubles \n     the number of RALs made by the industry.\n       The debt indicator has helped boost RAL profitability. The \n     IRS terminated the debt indicator in 1994 due to RAL fraud, \n     and the price of RALs rose significantly, from $29-$35 to \n     $29-$89. The IRS reinstated the debt indicator in 1999 partly \n     to lower RAL prices. RAL prices dipped for a year in 2000, \n     but have gone back up to pre-indicator levels. Meanwhile, the \n     amount of RAL fraud has multiplied since the debt indicator \n     was reinstated.\n       The debt indicator raises significant privacy issues. It is \n     unclear whether taxpayers realize they are allowing the IRS \n     to provide sensitive personal information to tax preparers \n     about debts owed to the federal government, such as child \n     support and student loan debts.\n\n\n                    A. History of the Debt Indicator\n\n       The debt indicator is a service provided by the Internal \n     Revenue Service that screens electronically filed tax returns \n     for any claims against a taxpayer's refund. The debt \n     indicator informs the preparer whether a taxpayer's full \n     refund amount will be paid and not offset by other \n     obligations collectible by the federal government, such as \n     prior tax debt, child support arrears, or delinquent student \n     loan debt.\n       When the IRS first provided the debt indicator in the early \n     1990s, it was called the ``direct deposit indicator.'' In \n     1994, the IRS terminated the debt indicator due to concerns \n     over massive fraud in e-filed returns that involved refund \n     anticipation loans (RALs). The elimination of the debt \n     indicator elicited ``screams of rage'' by the RAL industry. \n     In addition to cutting into their profits, the RAL industry \n     claimed there would be multitudes of disappointed clients who \n     could not get their RALs. Two of the four major RAL lenders, \n     Mellon Bank and Greenwood Trust, stopped making RALs and left \n     the market.\n       Over the next few years, the RAL industry pressed for \n     reinstatement of the debt indicator. Then, in 1998, Congress \n     imposed a goal on the IRS to have 80 percent of returns \n     electronically filed. Not coincidentally, a year later, the \n     IRS announced it was re-instating the Debt Indicator. \n     However, note that the Congressional 80 percent e-file goal \n     is not mandatory, but merely exhortatory, in that the \n     statutory language actually states ``it should be the goal of \n     the Internal Revenue Service to have at least 80 percent of \n     all such returns filed electronically by the year 2007.''\n       The first year of the reinstatement of the debt indicator \n     was a pilot. Subsequently, the IRS decided to make the debt \n     indicator permanent and provide it for all e-filed returns, \n     not just returns associated with a RAL application.\n\n\n               B. The Debt Indicator Increases RAL Volume\n\n       The debt indicator has had a dramatic effect on the volume \n     of RALs and electronically filed returns. In 1994, prior to \n     the elimination of the debt indicator, the number of RALs had \n     risen to 9.5 million. After the termination of the debt \n     indicator, RAL volume dropped and by 1999, the number of RALs \n     had fallen to 6 million. When the debt indicator was \n     reinstated effective the 2000 tax season, the number of RALs \n     rose sharply to 10.8 million. The number of RALs continued to \n     increase to 12.1 million in 2001 and 12.7 million in 2002.\n       Data from individual companies in the RAL industry showed \n     similar trends. In 1994, the nation's largest commercial \n     preparation chain, H Block, processed 5.5 million RAL \n     applications. After the debt indicator was eliminated, that \n     number dropped to less than half, 2.35 million in 1995. By \n     1999, that number was at 2.8 million. When the debt indicator \n     was reinstated, RAL volume rose to 4.8 million for Block.\n\n                              (In millions)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                             H Block #\n                     Year                       Overall #      of RAL\n                                                 of RALs    applications\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1994.........................................          9.5           5.5\n1995.........................................           NA           2.3\n1996.........................................  ...........           2.4\n1997.........................................  ...........           2.6\n1998.........................................  ...........           2.4\n1999.........................................            6           2.8\n2000.........................................         10.8           4.8\n2001.........................................         12.1           4.5\n2002.........................................         12.7           5.2\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Other industry player reported similar trends. In 1994, all \n     but 10,630 of the returns prepared by Jackson Hewitt were \n     associated with RALs. After the debt indicator was dropped, \n     the number of returns without RALs at Jackson Hewitt rose to \n     138,000 by late February 1995. RAL lender Santa Barbara Bank \n     & Trust reported a sharp increase in loans versus non-loan \n     refund anticipation checks following reinstatement of the \n     debt indicator.\n       The debt indicator also had similar effects on the volume \n     of electronically-filed returns in general. The IRS reported \n     there were 14 million e-filed returns in 1994, but only 12 \n     million in 1995. H Block reported that its e-filed returns \n     declined 22 percent in 1995. This decrease reflects the close \n     link between e-filed returns and RALs that existed in the \n     mid-1990s.\n       When the IRS reinstated the debt indicator, it publicly \n     acknowledged that it expected the program to produce 2 \n     million more e-filed returns than if it were not reinstated. \n     With the close link between e-filing and RALs, the IRS surely \n     must have been aware that there would be a corresponding \n     increase in the number of RALs. Indeed, RAL issuers predicted \n     that the reinstatement of the debt indicator would increase \n     RAL demand by 50 percent. These predictions proved correct, \n     as Block alone nearly doubled its RAL volume and made 2 \n     million more loans (and thus e-filed returns) in 2000. Thus, \n     much of the expected increase in e-filed returns was actually \n     an increase in the number of RALs.\n\n\n C. The Debt Indicator and RAL Approval Rates: The IRS Security Blanket\n\n       The debt indicator promotes RALs by assuring lenders that \n     the taxpayer's refund will be issued and thus the loan will \n     be repaid. For the pre-1995 debt indicator, if the indicator \n     came back showing there was no federal offset, there was an \n     over 99 percent chance the IRS would issue the refund. At \n     that time, the approval rate for RALs was 92 percent--and all \n     but 0.5 percent of loan denials were turned down based on the \n     debt indicator. As one IRS employee stated, the debt \n     indicator was a ``federally supplied security blanket'' and \n     ``we were doing their credit check for them.''\n       The elimination of the debt indicator in 1995 significantly \n     lowered RAL approval rates. The approval rate for Beneficial \n     (which became Household) dropped from 92 percent to 78 \n     percent. This 78 percent rate includes partial approvals; the \n     approval rate for a RAL of the taxpayer's full refund was \n     only 40-50 percent. Banc One's approval rate for RALs also \n     dropped by 25-30 percent. Even with the decrease in approval \n     rates, Beneficial ended up with significant losses on RALs in \n     1995.\n       With the reinstatement of the debt indicator, RAL approval \n     rates appear to be back around 90 percent. Thus, the debt \n     indicator helps increase RAL approval rates and RAL profits. \n     Of course, this service is not without its cost. One question \n     is how much does it cost IRS to provide the debt indicator? \n     While we do not have definitive information, note that in \n     1994, the IRS suggested imposing a fee for the debt indicator \n     of $8 per return.\n\n\n    D. Reinstatement of the Debt Indicator Has Not Lowered RAL Fees\n\n       The existence of the debt indicator has had an impact on \n     RAL fees as well, although in the end it appears to be more \n     of a profitability boost for RAL lenders. Prior to the \n     elimination of the debt indicator, the loan fee for RALs was \n     approximately $29 to $35. The largest RAL lender, Beneficial, \n     charged a flat fee of $29 per RAL. Bank One charged a flat \n     fee of $31, while the lender for Jackson Hewitt charged $29 \n     to $35.\n       After the debt indicator was eliminated, RAL fees jumped \n     dramatically. Beneficial began using a tiered fee structure, \n     with fees of $29 to $89, depending on the size of the loan. \n     Banc One began charging $41 to $69 and Jackson Hewitt charged \n     $69 to $100. By 1999, Beneficial loans made through H Block \n     cost $40 to $90.\n       One of the benefits that the IRS and industry touted for \n     reinstating the debt indicator\n\n[[Page S11650]]\n\n     was lower RAL fees. In fact, lower RAL fees constituted one \n     of four measures by which the success of the pilot program \n     for reinstatement was to be judged. The IRS Assistant \n     Commissioner for Electronic Tax Administration, Bob Barr, \n     threatened to end the debt indicator if RAL prices did not \n     decrease. Industry expressed its agreement that fees would \n     decrease, with one RAL issuer claimed that its fees would be \n     reduced 30 to 40 percent.\n       When the debt indicator was reinstated, RAL fees did go \n     down. However, this decrease turned out to be temporary. For \n     example, RAL fees at H Block and Household Bank dropped for \n     one year, but then shot back to pre-Debt Indicator levels. \n     After the IRS reinstated the debt indicator, Household and \n     Block's fees went from $40-$90 to $20-$60 for the 2000 tax \n     season. Both the IRS and industry touted this decrease in RAL \n     fees. However, fees went back up in 2001, with Block/\n     Household charging $30 to $87--close to the fees charged \n     prior to reinstatement of the debt indicator.\n       Also, part of the decrease in RAL fees in 2000 occurred \n     because Block offered a ``no fee'' RAL in six markets, \n     including entire state of California. However, Block and \n     Beneficial appear not to have offered this ``no fee RAL'' \n     after the 2000 tax season. One reason was probably that the \n     ``no fee RAL'' program was subject of a lawsuit for deception \n     by a competitor.\n       RAL fees never went down again after 2001, but RAL profits \n     have increased. The increase in RAL fees from 2000 to 2001 \n     for H Block/Beneficial resulted in Block's RAL revenues \n     increasing by 49 percent from 2000 to 2001. Most of the \n     revenue increase appears to be the result of the higher RAL \n     fees, because per-RAL-revenue rose by 43.9 percent, while \n     sales volume only increased by 2.7 percent.\n       Thus, the main effect of the debt indicator appears to be, \n     not in lowering RAL fees, but in higher RAL profits. If the \n     reinstatement of the debt indicator had really lowered RAL \n     fees back to pre-1995 prices, a RAL would only cost a flat \n     fee of $37.53 or $45.91 in 2005 (the equivalent of $29 or $35 \n     in 1994 adjusted for inflation). Instead, they currently cost \n     about $35 to $115, with Block and its lending partner \n     charging a fee of $100 for RALs for the average refund of \n     slightly over $2,000. These fees translate into effective \n     annual interest rates (APR) ranging from about 40 percent to \n     over 700 percent.\n\n                                                  (In dollars)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        RAL Price--Beneficial/                              RAL Price--Jackson\n                Year                       Household & Block        RAL price--Bank One           Hewitt\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1994................................  $29.......................  $31...................  $29 to 35\n1995................................  29 to 89..................  41 to 69..............  69 to 100\n1996................................  29 to 89..................\n1997................................  40 to 90..................\n1998................................  40 to 90..................\n1999................................  40 to 90..................  ......................  49 to 80\n2000................................  20 to 60..................\n2001................................  30 to 87..................\n2002................................  30 to 90..................  34 to 87..............\n2003................................  30 to 90..................  34 to 89..............  34 to 89\n2004................................  30 to 100.................  34 to 89..............  29 to 94 (& 5 for\n                                                                                           EITC)\n2005................................  30 to 110.................  34 to 99..............  29 to 99 (& 5 for\n                                                                                           EITC)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       It appears the debt indicator is an IRS subsidy that \n     increases profits for the RAL industry. The debt indicator \n     has made each individual RAL more profitable, encouraging RAL \n     lenders to aggressively promote RALs and increase RAL volume.\n\n\n                           E. Privacy Issues\n\n       In addition to being a taxpayer-funded subsidy to the RAL \n     industry, the debt indicator program raises significant \n     privacy concerns. In fact, the IRS may be violating its own \n     privacy law in providing the service to tax preparers. The \n     IRS Code contains broad and strong privacy protections for \n     taxpayer information. Section 6103 of the IRS Code states \n     that all ``[r]eturn and return information shall be \n     confidential'' and shall not be disclosed. ``Return \n     information'' is broadly defined and includes the taxpayer's \n     ``nature, source, or amount of his . . . liabilities . . .'' \n     Therefore, information as to whether a taxpayer is subject to \n     a refund offset would be information about the nature or \n     amount of a taxpayer's liabilities.\n       It would seem that the information disclosed by the IRS to \n     a RAL provider would constitute a violation of the IRS \n     privacy statute, unless there is an exemption. One possible \n     exemption would be the provision that allows the IRS to \n     disclose return information with a taxpayer's consent. \n     However, the IRS regulations set forth clear and definite \n     requirements for such consent, including that the consent be \n     set forth in a separate written document pertaining to the \n     disclosure, and that the document reference the particular \n     data item of return information to be disclosed.\n       A document that conceivably grants such consent is IRS Form \n     8453, which is used to authenticate an e-filed return. Yet \n     the consent to disclose information in Form 8453 is not a \n     separate, stand-alone document pertaining solely to the \n     disclosure. Furthermore, the consent is buried in small print \n     inadequate to clearly inform taxpayers that they are \n     permitting the IRS to disclose personal financial information \n     to their tax preparers about whether they owe a child support \n     or student loan debt.\n       Another exemption allows the IRS to send an acknowledgement \n     to an e-file provider without the need for a stand-alone \n     consent form, along with ``such other information as the \n     [IRS] determines is necessary to the operation of the \n     electronic filing program.'' Because RALs increase the number \n     of e-filed returns, the IRS may argue that this language \n     permits it to send the debt indicator in the e-file \n     acknowledgement (as it currently does) without a stand-alone \n     consent form. However, while it increases the number of e-\n     filed returns, that is not a factor that is ``necessary'' to \n     the operation of the e-file program.\n       Even if IRS can legally provide the debt indicator, there \n     still remain significant privacy issues regarding the \n     program. With the debt indicator, the IRS is providing an \n     indicator that communicates personal and potentially \n     embarrassing financial tax information to the tax preparer. \n     Indeed, when the IRS proposed requiring a similar indicator \n     on tax returns filed through the Free File Alliance, \n     commercial preparers objected strongly, citing privacy \n     concerns. National Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson noted \n     ironically ``These businesses already rely heavily on returns \n     flagged with an indicator to tell them that this return has \n     other outstanding refund offsets'' and ``Let's use the same \n     argument to say the debt indicator should be eliminated.''\n       Given the lack of prominence of the consent in Form 8453, \n     it is unclear whether most taxpayers actually realize they \n     are giving permission for IRS to reveal the presence of \n     government debts to their preparer. It is even unclear \n     whether they know about the debt indicator itself or \n     understand what it is.\n\n\n                        F. Re-Emergence of Fraud\n\n       The debt indicator represents an IRS subsidy in another \n     respect, that is, in the amount of fraud it promotes and the \n     taxpayer dollars spent combating that fraud. As discussed \n     above, the IRS dropped the debt indicator in 1994 due to \n     concerns over mounting fraud in refund claims. IRS data had \n     indicated that 92 percent of fraudulent returns filed \n     electronically involved RALs. It was believed that the debt \n     indicator led to tax fraud because of its role in supporting \n     RALs, whose quick turnaround period makes fraud detection \n     difficult.\n       The elimination of the debt indicator seems to have had its \n     intended effect. According to the Assistant Attorney General \n     in charge of the Tax Division at the Department of Justice, \n     eliminating the debt indicator, along with other fraud \n     prevention measures, successfully reduced the number of \n     fraudulent claims.\n       When IRS reinstated the debt indicator in 1999, it \n     attempted to address the fraud issue by requiring tax \n     preparers to institute fraud prevention measures. The first \n     year of the debt indicator was termed a pilot, and only \n     certain tax preparers who entered into memoranda of agreement \n     with the IRS were eligible to receive the debt indicator. As \n     a condition of the agreement, tax preparers were required to \n     actively screen returns for potential fraud and abuse, using \n     measure such as requiring two valid forms of identification \n     and verifying questionable W-2s. However, after the 2000 tax \n     season, the debt indicator is no longer a pilot and is \n     provided to all taxpayers who e-file. Thus, it is unclear \n     whether these fraud prevention measures are still mandatory.\n       Whether or not these fraud prevention measures are in \n     effect, fraud is still a significant issue with respect to \n     RALs. Gary Bell, Director of the IRS Criminal Investigation \n     Division's Refund Crimes Unit, noted that currently 80 \n     percent of fraudulent e-filed returns are tied to a RAL or \n     other refund financial product. Furthermore, fraud appears to \n     have increased since the debt indicator was reinstated. Bell \n     noted that e-file fraud had increased by more than 1,400 \n     percent since 1999 (when the debt indicator was reinstated), \n     and that approximately 1 in every 1,200 e-filed returns was \n     phony, compared with a rate of about 1 in every 5,000 four \n     years ago.\n       The Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement \n     Network (FinCEN) has raised similar concerns about the role \n     of RALs in promoting tax fraud. FinCEN issued a warning to \n     banks in August 2004, regarding RAL fraud. In this report, \n     FinCEN also noted that RAL fraud had multiplied between 2000 \n     and 2003. FinCEN noted that ``To make this type of loan \n     appealing to the public, funds are made immediately \n     available, leaving little time for the lender to perform due \n     diligence to prevent fraud.'' As one commentator noted, the \n     IRS has a fraud detection system, but ``it may take the IRS \n     three or more weeks to process the return, especially in the \n     peak of the spring filing season. Meanwhile, the RAL lenders \n     have processed the loan within a couple of days of the return \n     being filed, the money is in the hands of the bad guys, and \n     they can disappear without a trace, . . . .''\n\n\n                             G. Conclusion\n\n       As it did in 1994, the IRS should terminate the debt \n     indicator. The program represents a form of corporate welfare \n     and government subsidy of an industry already rolling in \n     profits from making usurious loans to low-income taxpayers. \n     It has increased profits for the RAL industry, while \n     resulting in no permanent price decreases for consumers. Not \n     only does the RAL industry siphon off hundreds of millions of \n     tax dollars by skimming the Earned Income Tax Credit from \n     working poor families, the IRS abets this drain and makes it \n     more profitable by conducting part of the RAL lenders' credit \n     checks using taxpayer-funded resources. Furthermore, the debt \n     indicator represents even more of a subsidy, in that it \n     generates more fraud related to RALs, which the IRS must \n     spend enforcement dollars to address.\n\n\n[[Page S11651]]\n\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr President, I speak on the subject of full funding for \nthe payments to State governments in order to comply with the \nrequirements mandated on January 1, 2006, under the Help America Vote \nAct of 2002, HAVA.\n  On October 16, 2002, over 3 years ago, the Senate overwhelmingly \nadopted the conference report for this bipartisan landmark legislation \nby a vote of 98-2. The House of Representatives adopted the conference \nreport by a vote of 357-48 on October 10, 2002. President Bush signed \nHAVA into law on Oct. 29, 2002. At the White House signing ceremony, \nsurrounded by a bipartisan group of congressional members, President \nBush said in a brief speech:\n\n       When problems arise in the administration of elections, we \n     have a responsibility to fix them. . . . Every registered \n     voter deserves to have confidence that the system is fair and \n     elections are honest, that every vote is recorded and that \n     the rules are consistently applied. The legislation I sign \n     today will add to the nation's confidence.\n\n  I agree with the President. We must follow the American tradition of \nfixing problems that occur in our national elections system. HAVA began \na new era in election law--one where the Federal Government works with \nState and local governments, in conjunction with civil rights, voting \nrights and disability organizations, to conduct fair, free and \ntransparent elections in our Nation. HAVA is our colective promise to \nthe American people to fix the problems in our Federal elections. After \nthe 2000 November elections, Americans recognized that real election \nreform changes must be made to ensure the integrity and security of our \ndemocracy. Congress made a commitment to the States, and to the voters \nof this Nation, that we would be a full partner in the conduct of \nFederal elections. Congress accomplished much with the passage of HAVA; \nbut two years later in the November 2004 general election, some voters \nfaced both old barriers to ballot access that HAVA promised to remove \nand new ones. We can do better and we must do better. Full funding of \nHAVA will ensure America does better in conducting Federal elections by \nensuring both ballot access and ballot integrity.\n  Building democracy and freedom for every American must begin at home \nin the United States. In the wake of the October 15, 2005 province-by-\nprovince election on the Constitution in Iraq, it is critical that \nAmericans take stock of our own decentralized elections systems. In \nlight of the continuing barriers and irregularities that Americans \nfaced at polling places across this Nation in 2004, we cannot fail to \nfully fund HAVA to fix these problems. Our ability to successfully do \nso goes directly to ensuring the integrity of elections and ensuring \nthe confidence of the American people in the final results of those \nelections. America's ability to promote free societies abroad is \ninextricably linked to our ability to expand and secure transparent \nelections at home. At a time when we are spending billions of dollars \nto ensure the spread of democracy across the globe, we must ensure the \nprimary right to vote for all eligible voters, regardless of race, \nethnicity, age, disability, or resources.\n  For the first time in our Nation's history, Congress acknowledged the \nresponsibility of the Federal Government to provide leadership and \nfunding to States and local governments in the administration of \nFederal elections. First, Congress codified the Federal role in HAVA by \nentering into a partnership with States to restore the public's \nconfidence in the final results of Federal elections and to ensure that \nevery eligible American had an equal opportunity to cast a vote and \nhave that vote counted. Next, Congress required States to conduct \nFederal elections according to minimum Federal requirements for voting \nsystem standards, provisional balloting and Statewide voter \nregistration lists, including new requirements to prevent voter fraud. \nFinally, Congress refused to impose unfunded mandate on States and \nauthorize nearly $4 billion in payments to States over 3 fiscal years \nto implememt the HAVA requirements and disability access grants and \nservices.\n  January 1, 2006, is the effective date for two of the most important \nFederal requirements mandated by HAVA: the voluntary voting system \nstandards and the Statewide computerized voter registration list. Both \nrequirements are expected to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat \nby providing an equal opportunity for every eligible voter to cast a \nvote and have that vote counted, as well as providing important \nantifraud requirements to protect and preserve the integrity of our \ndecentralized elections systems. In order to comply with HAVA, States \nmust timely implement both requirements, which are expected to cost \nmillions in both Federal dollars for the 95 percent portion and State \ndollars for the 5 percent portion of the expenditures.\n  To date, the President's budget, for the second year in a row, while \nproviding millions in funding for democratic elections in foreign \ncountries, such as Afghanistan and Iraq, assumes no funding for \nrequirements or disability access payments to the States.\n  Congress also failed to fully fund HAVA 2 years in a row. HAVA is \nunderfunded by a total of $822 million. In addition to the $600 million \nauthorized in fiscal year 2005, but not appropriated Congress \nunderfunded HAVA by $222 million over the last 3 fiscal years, from \nfiscal year 2003 to fiscal year 2005. As a result, HAVA currently has a \ntotal funding shortfall of $822 million in federal funds, $727 million \nfor election administration requirements and $95 million for disability \ngrant payments.\n  The absence of the $727 million for requirements payments will likely \nimpede the Statewide implementation of the two most critical election \nreforms, the voting system standards and the Statewide voter \nregistration lists in time for the 2006 congressional elections.\n  No civil right is more fundamental to the vitality and endurance of a \ndemocracy of the people, by the people, and for the people, than the \npeople's right to vote. HAVA has been acknowledged as the ``first civil \nrights law of the 21st century.'' Full funding of HAVA enjoys the \nsupport of a broad coalition of organizations representing the civil \nrights communities, voting rights groups, disabilities groups, and \nState and local governments, spearheaded by the Leadership Conference \non Civil Rights and the National Association of Secretaries of State.\n  I am grateful to LCCR and NASS for their consistent leadership in \nensuring that Congress fulfills our commitment to fully fund the HAVA \nreforms. I applaud the nonpartisan work of the LCCR/NASS Coalition and \nlook forward to continuing to work with them to see this commitment \ncome to fruition.\n  The organizations have submitted a letter, dated October 20, 2005, in \nsupport of full funding in the amount of $727 million for HAVA \nimplementation in fiscal year 2006. The letter, and I quote, states \nthat:\n\n       The states and localities need the remaining authorized \n     funding to implement the requirements of HAVA and the federal \n     EAC needs to be fully funded to carry out its \n     responsibilities as well.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1)\n  Mr. DODD. If we fail to honor commitment now and only appropriate \npartial funding, we may jeopardize the ability of the States to \nimplement these historic and comprehensive election reforms. We will \nalso miss an opportunity to ensure the integrity and security of \nFederal elections and the confidence of the American people in the \nfinal results of those elections.\n  While I will not offer an amendment today to provide for this \nadditional funding, I am serving notice that as the States proceed to \ncomplete implementation of the HAVA requirements, I will continue to \nmonitor this situation and as the needs of the States become more \nclear, I will come back to my colleagues for prompt action to ensure \nthat the States do not face an unfunded mandate.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n  Make Election Reform a Reality--Fully Fund the Help America Vote Act\n\n                                                 October 20, 2005.\n       Dear Senators: We, the undersigned organizations, urge you \n     to support full funding for the Help America Vote Act of 2002 \n     (HAVA) and include $727 million in the Transportation, \n     Treasury, Housing and Urban Development, the Judiciary, the \n     District of Columbia, and Independent Agencies\n\n[[Page S11652]]\n\n     Appropriations Act of 2006. This figure represents the \n     authorized HAVA funds for federal requirements that remain \n     unappropriated.\n       HAVA, which passed with overwhelming bipartisan support, \n     includes an important list of reforms that states must \n     implement for federal elections. State and local governments \n     have been working on such reforms as improving disability \n     access to polling places, updating voting equipment, \n     implementing new provisional balloting procedures, developing \n     and implementing a new statewide voter registration database \n     system, training poll workers and educating voters on new \n     procedures and new equipment.\n       To help state and local governments pay for these reforms, \n     HAVA authorized $3.9 billion over three fiscal years. To \n     date, Congress has generously appropriated $3 billion between \n     FY03 and FY04. Unfortunately, while HAVA authorized funding \n     for states for FY05, none was appropriated. The states and \n     localities need the remaining authorized funding to implement \n     the requirements of HAVA, and the federal EAC needs to be \n     fully funded to carry out its responsibilities as well.\n       States and localities are laboring to implement the \n     requirements of HAVA based on a federal commitment that HAVA \n     would not be an unfunded mandate. State officials have \n     incorporated the federal amounts Congress promised when \n     developing their HAVA implementation budgets and plans. \n     Without the full federal funding, state and local governments \n     will encounter serious fiscal shortfalls and will not be able \n     to afford complete implementation of important HAVA mandates. \n     According to a state survey, lack of federal funding for HAVA \n     implementation will result in many states scaling back their \n     voter and poll worker education initiatives and on voting \n     equipment purchase plans, both of which are vital components \n     to making every vote count in America.\n       We are thankful that you have seen the importance of \n     funding the work of the Election Assistance Commission in \n     FY06. States, localities and civic organizations look forward \n     to the work products from the EAC that will aid them in their \n     implementation of HAVA i.e., the voting system standards, the \n     statewide database guidance, and the studies on provisional \n     voting, voter education, poll worker training, and voter \n     fraud and voter intimidation.\n       We thank you for your support of funding for the Help \n     America Vote Act, and we look forward to working with you on \n     this critical issue.

Today the Senate adopted unanimously the \nNelson-Smith amendment which puts the Senate on record supporting the \nplacement of al-Manar on the Specially Designated Global Terrorist \nlist. Al-Manar is a global satellite television operation dedicated to \nbroadcasting inflammatory and radical Islamic propaganda.\n  Al-Manar, a television station funded by Hezbollah, promotes hatred, \nanti-Semitism, and glorifies suicide bombing. The actions of this \nnetwork are truly appalling and frightening.\n  Viewed via satellite throughout the Muslim world, al-Manar promotes \nsuicide attacks against American and Israeli targets and encourages \nIraqi insurgents to attack U.S. troops. It includes particularly \nshocking children's programming, aimed at shaping the beliefs and \nvalues of the next generation of Muslim youth.\n  The station broadcasts programs that spread anti-Semitic material, \nperpetuating myths about Jewish history, which resulted in the \nstation's recent ban from French airwaves. This is not a media outlet \nsharing the news; it is a propaganda tool used by a terrorist \norganization to spread its message of violence and hatred.\n  The U.S. Government placed al-Manar on the Terror Exclusion List \nwhich prevents persons associated with the channel from traveling to \nthe U.S. There is a much stricter list, the Specially Designated Global \nTerrorist list, which allows much harsher penalties, including \nfinancial sanctions against individuals, groups, and banks that do \nbusiness with al-Manar. So far, the Government has not placed al-Manar \non this list.\n  The case is clear and obvious: al-Manar is supporting and promoting \nterrorism. This warrants placement on the list of Specially Designated \nGlobal Terrorists.\n  In August, 51 Senators sent a letter to the President, urging him to \nplace al-Manar on the Specially Designated Global Terrorist list. I ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 2, 2005.\n     President George W. Bush,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Bush: We write to urge you to place al-\n     Manar, the official television station of Hezbollah on the \n     Treasury Department's Specially Designated Global Terrorist \n     Entity list (SDGT) and to aggressively target the \n     organizations that aid in its broadcast. Hezbollah, a known \n     terrorist organization, funds al-Manar, calling it a `station \n     of resistance.' Viewed via satellite throughout the Muslim \n     world, al-Manar promotes suicide attacks against American and \n     Israeli targets and encourages Iraqi insurgents to attack \n     U.S. troops.\n       Al-Manar is a mouthpiece of hatred and violence. In \n     addition, the station broadcasts programs that spread anti-\n     Semitic material, perpetuating myths about Jewish history, \n     which resulted in the station's recent ban from French \n     airwaves. This is not a media outlet sharing the news; it is \n     a propaganda tool used by a terrorist organization to spread \n     its message of violence and hatred.\n       We welcome your December 2004 decision to place al-Manar on \n     the Terror Exclusion List (TEL), which allows the U.S. \n     Government to deport or deny admission to aliens involved \n     with al-Manar's support or endorsement of terrorist \n     activities. But further acknowledgment of al-Manar's role in \n     spreading violence and hatred is warranted and should be \n     shown through its placement on the SDGT list. This step would \n     allow the U.S. government to sanction foreign banks and \n     freeze the financial assets of individuals or organizations \n     that associate with the station. This would cause many \n     telecommunications corporations and financial institutions to \n     reconsider their decision to work with al-Manar.\n       The United States must use all available means to stop the \n     transmission of al-Manar's programs. Placing al-Manar and the \n     Lebanese Communications Group S.A.L., its parent company, on \n     the SDGT will send a clear message that the United States is \n     serious about confronting any organization that supports the \n     violence carried out by terrorist groups.\n       We strongly support the global war on terrorism and \n     continuing efforts to stop terrorists wherever they may be. \n     Stopping al-Manar's broadcast of hatred and violence is an \n     integral part of the global war on terrorism. Thank you for \n     your time and consideration. We look forward to your \n     response.\n           Sincerely,\n         Gordon Smith, Evan Bayh, John F.

Mr. President, I wanted to take a minute, as we finish \nthis bill, to again thank my colleague from Missouri for his tremendous \nwork on this bill. I know he has been under personal duress today and \nhad a late night last night, but his team won despite what it appears \nto be. I think he has done a tremendous job and I wish to thank him.\n  I also wish to thank all of the majority staff, John Kamarck Paul \nDoerrer, Cheh Kim, Lula Edwards, Josh Manley, and Matt McCardle for \ntheir help in working with us for many months along the way, and also \nour minority staff, Peter Rogoff, Kate Hallahan, Diana Hamilton, Bill \nSimpson, Meaghan McCarthy, as well as my personal staff, especially \nCasey Sixkiller. I also want to thank all of the floor staff who have \nbeen diligent in working with us as we have moved this bill through and \nagain thanks to my colleague from Missouri for his tremendous work on \nthis bill.\n  Mr. BOND. I continue to be grateful for the cooperation of the \nSenator from Washington and her staff. I was going to go down the list \nof the staff members on both sides. I will incorporate by reference and \nsay once again our staff worked very well together. This is the first \ntime anybody had dealt with a TTHUD bill. It has many interesting \nmoving parts, and some of them move in different directions at the same \ntime. We could not have done it without the tremendous assistance of \nall of the staff, plus the floor staff.\n  I want to say a special thanks to Lula Davis, Dave Schiappa, and all \nthe people in front here for their unfailing willingness to sit and \nhelp us through all of these things. This was more exciting than I \nwanted it to be, and their help enabled us to get through.\n  We would also like to put in a special thanks to Mike Solon in the \nWhip's office for helping us work on a number of things and both the \nAppropriations Committee leaders, Chairman Cochran and Senator Byrd. \nAlso, the majority leader and minority leader were a great help.\n  So we are most grateful, and we are delighted to be out of the way \nnow, and we will go to conference. We look forward to coming back with \nperhaps an even better process and a good product.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/20/senate-section/article/S11653-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BOND.

It is not \nnecessarily the biggest tax increase that Congress has ever voted but a \nvery sizable tax increase.\n  Obviously, if we are going to increase taxes, it ought to be done by \na vote of the Congress and not done automatically. So we have to take \naction before we adjourn this fall, and that is what the reconciliation \ntax relief bill is all about.\n  It is quite obvious from these news conferences that the Democrats \nhave been having, in statements on the floor, that they do not seem to \nunderstand that this is going to happen, and if it does happen, it is \ngoing to hurt middle income taxpayers as well as lower income \ntaxpayers.\n  In press reports for several weeks now, the distinguished Democratic \nleader suggested that we cease all efforts to address expiring tax \nrelief provisions. The senior Senator from Nevada stated as follows: I \nthink we need to revisit this budget and reconciliation. Is it really \nthe time to have $70 billion more in tax cuts?\n  Well, we are not going to have $70 billion more in tax cuts if we \npass this reconciliation tax relief package. We are going to continue \nthe tax policy we have had for the last several years, and if we do not \npass it, we are going to have a $70 billion tax increase, and that is \nwhat inaction is going to bring about. I see the Senator suggesting \nthat that happen. I am going to say why that is bad not only for \ntaxpayers, but that is bad for the economy of our country.\n  Then we also had the assistant Democratic leader, the senior Senator\n\n[[Page S11654]]\n\nfrom Illinois, likewise attack the notion of tax relief. This very \nafternoon, the ranking Democratic member of the Budget Committee, the \nsenior Senator from North Dakota, attacked the idea of further tax \nrelief.\n  Those words again. They want people to believe that we are going to \ncut taxes further, but if we do not take action, taxes are going up, \nnot down. If we pass a bill, they are going to stay where they have \nbeen for the last several years.\n  Clearly, this line of attack is being coordinated by the leadership \nteam on the other side of the aisle. As is usual with the question of \ntax relief, the East Coast media tend to be echoing the line of attack \nfrom the leadership of the opposition.\n  Yesterday, October 19, the Democratic leadership held a press \nconference to criticize further tax relief efforts. The purpose of the \npress conference was opposition to Republicans' attempt to spend \nbillions on tax breaks for special interests while cutting health care, \nstudent loans, and other crucial assistance through their--meaning \nRepublicans--immoral budget.\n  Now, understand, morality is brought into this. That kind of \nincendiary language is what makes folks outside of the Washington \nBeltway angry. Not only is it patently false, it is also over the top. \nAnybody with an ounce of common sense knows it.\n  Immoral? Give me a break. What is immoral is wasting taxpayer money \nto gin up this kind of partisan ``attack dog'' language because it \ndiverts legislative resources from what this Congress needs to be doing \nand that is solving problems.\n  I have heard from my friend and ranking member, Senator Baucus, that \nthe Democratic leadership may now be supporting an extension of some of \nthese provisions that they seem to be attacking at the same time. Be \nthat as it may, we have to look at a lot of other things besides the \nlargely business tax relief that is included in what we call extenders, \nextending from one year to the next or the next several years things \nthat automatically expire, that if we do not extend them, taxes go up \nrather than staying level.\n  I want to put all this debate in context, because until now, what I \nhave set in motion here is what is coming from the other side so you \nhave a context for the points I wish to make.\n  First off, let's take a look at the Democratic leadership's point on \nthe budget. Why is the budget important, some people ought to ask and \nlegitimately ask. The budget--we call it the budget resolution--is a \nblueprint or kind of an outline that sets the overall level of spending \nand the revenue of the Federal Government. The budget, then, sets the \nground rules for all the other spending and revenue legislation that \nwill be considered by the Senate over the course of a year. So we pass \nthe budget resolution in the spring, and all the appropriations bills \nand the tax bills and everything else have to fit into that budget \nresolution.\n  Under the Senate rules, then, a bill that exceeds the levels set in \nthe budget resolution could possibly be, and often is, subject to a 60-\nvote point of order; in other words, taking 60 votes to go beyond the \nbudget, which is very difficult to get in this body. That is why you \nget a lot more fiscal discipline with a budget resolution. By imposing \nthis supermajority requirement, the budget encourages the Senate to \nstay within the overall limits we set in our resolution while at the \nsame time providing opportunities to exceed those limits if there are \nextenuating circumstances.\n  Chairman Judd Gregg of the Budget Committee has used this tool of a \npoint of order to keep spending under control. On this appropriation \nbill that was just completed after 2 or 3 days' work, that has proved \neffective, in three or four instances, to keep a lot of additional \nspending from happening--spending that, if we just had a simple \nmajority without a budget resolution, could possibly not have been \nprevented.\n  By the way, despite all the posturing about fiscal responsibility \ncoming from the Democratic side, I am still waiting for spending cuts, \nideas on how we can save money on expenditures, coming from the other \nside. I have asked my colleagues on the other side of the aisle over \nthe years to put their money where their mouth is. The Finance \nCommittee that I chair produced $180 billion in revenue raisers and got \n$135 billion of that enacted. So we have produced on the revenue side. \nI am going to be showing with that chart here in just a little bit \nwhere we have also had other tremendous advantages from the tax policy \nof the last 4 years. But where are the critics, then, who seem to \nalways want to raise revenue? Where are they when there is an \nopportunity to come up with ideas to save money on the spending side of \nthe ledger?\n  I have always said it would be one thing to raise taxes, and I might \nbe willing to consider doing that if I could ever come to the \nconclusion that you could raise taxes high enough to satisfy the \nappetite of a lot of big spenders in this Congress to spend money. If I \nwould ever see a limit, I might be willing to settle for something if \nthat was the end of it. But you never have the end, it seems. You never \nhave enough revenue for the people who want to spend money.\n  Budget reconciliation, as has been the point of the news conference I \nalready referred to, is often the subject of much controversy. So I \nwould like to take a moment and focus on the reconciliation bill my \ncommittee is going to have to consider between now and adjournment in \norder to retain the present level of taxation. If we do not take \naction, which is what the Democrats are asking us not to do, taxes are \ngoing to go up.\n  As chairman of this tax writing committee that we call the Finance \nCommittee in the Congress, I have a responsibility for all of the \nlegislation that affects Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, the \nincome tax code. The budget resolution we passed earlier this year \nprovides reconciliation instructions for my committee to achieve $150 \nbillion in program savings. And by the way, we finally have a package \nput together that will do this, a package that I believe we will be \nable to vote out of committee next Tuesday. We have set our committee \nthere so we will meet our savings on the expenditure side--we will meet \nthose goals.\n  Of course, then the other part of my work is the $70 billion of tax \nrelief that is not a tax reduction but maintaining the existing level \nof taxation.\n  While these instructions from the Budget Committee--or you might say \nnow it is policy, by the full Senate--do not actually require the \nFinance Committee to enact any specific policy, there are numbers and \npolicies that are assumed within the numbers that the Senate has given \nme. Today, I will focus on the tax relief portion of the budget. After \nall, that is where the attacks have come from the Democratic leadership \nthrough their news conferences and statements here on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Start with a basic number. When the Senate Budget Committee \nconsidered the resolution over a half year ago this year, Republicans \nlaid out a plan to reconcile tax relief--in other words, to keep the \ntaxes from automatically going up, not to cut taxes from where they are \ntoday. This plan was the product of discussion with members of the \nRepublican caucus. Although the process was driven by Republican \nmembers, the substance of the proposal is bipartisan. Our objective, \nthen as now, is to preserve current law levels of tax relief. The plan \ncenters on a seamless extension of tax relief provisions that began in \nPresident Bush's first term, in 2001. It is critical that these \nprovisions be rationalized with a common sunset date. Assuring \ntaxpayers of the continuity of promised tax relief should be our \nhighest priority. Predictability of tax policy, in other words, is \nessential to a vibrant, growing economy. Taxpayers should not face the \nreversal of the level of tax relief we have delivered. It is going to \nhave terrible economic consequences if we do.\n  Let me repeat. Reconciliation is about preventing automatic tax \nincreases, it is not about new tax relief proposals.\n  Some on the other side have been critical of the $70 billion in \nreconciled tax relief from the day we passed the budget resolution. \nWhere, let me ask, is the Democrat leadership's plan for tax relief? Or \ndo they propose that we start taxing middle-income Americans by letting \nthese things sunset and have an automatic increase in taxes? Has anyone \nseen a Democratic proposal for maintaining existing tax policy so we do \nnot have an automatic tax increase? All we seem to hear, based upon \nthese\n\n[[Page S11655]]\n\nnews conferences and statements, happens to be criticism. How many \ntimes have we heard about the alternative minimum tax or what we call \nAMT? We heard about it plenty of times. We even heard \nincorrect assertions that this budget does not address alternative \nminimum tax problems.\n\n  Guess what. The reconciliation bill has room for extending the \ncurrent patch, or ``hold harmless'' for millions of families who, if we \ndo nothing, are going to face the alternative minimum tax. These are \nnot the wealthy people that the alternative minimum tax was intended to \nhit. These are going to be 5 million more middle-income tax-paying \npeople who presently are not hit by it. So where is the Democratic \nleadership plan for AMT relief? When they say we ought to rethink this \nbudget resolution, are they saying we are going to tax these 5 million \npeople who have not been hit by this by doing nothing between now and \nthe end of the year? Where is the response for the current period? I \nhave been looking for it. I can't find it, from the other side. All we \nare hearing is another excuse to make the American taxpayers second-\nclass citizens. In this case, spending for the hurricane might be the \nexcuse. There always seems to be a reason to deny tax relief or \nautomatically increase taxes on middle-income Americans.\n  Likewise, there always seems to be an excuse for dodging spending \nrestraint. Let taxes go up automatically, don't do anything to reduce \nspending. In short, it seems that the Democratic leadership cares more \nabout spending taxpayers' money than keeping the tax burden low. The \nAmerican taxpayer has done his or her part. Receipts are way ahead of \nlast year--way ahead of where even we predicted they would be. \nAccording to Treasury data, receipts last year were $1.880 billion. \nThis year, receipts are $2.154 billion. So this is an increase of $274 \nbillion coming in this year, more than last year without increasing \ntaxes, with no rates of tax increase.\n  Even taking into consideration that level of taxation, in a news \nconference the Democratic leadership said we ought to rethink our tax \npolicy. According to the Congressional Budget Office--and I might refer \nto that occasionally as CBO--the CBO receipts are up for this fiscal \nyear alone by $97 billion over what CBO guessed they would be earlier \nthis year--$97 billion more coming in than the official estimators said \njust a few months ago would be coming in.\n  Whichever figure you might use, either that $274 billion more coming \nin in 2005 than in 2004 or the $97 billion more that is coming in, more \nthan the CBO estimated, this is very definitely an impressive \nimprovement on the revenue side of the budget. That amount exceeds the \namount of reconciled tax relief over 5 years by $70 billion that we \nprovided in this budget resolution that will be the subject of \nlegislation on this floor in the next 4 weeks.\n  As a percentage of the economy, which is known as the gross domestic \nproduct, Federal receipts are up to about 17.5 percent of GDP. The \nhistorical average is right about 18 percent. When I say historical \naverage, I mean over a period of time from the late 1950s until today \naveraging about 18 percent of taxes coming into the Federal Government \nas a share of the gross domestic product. So we are getting back to \nhistorical averages, but you wouldn't know that by listening to some of \nthe alarmist claims for more revenue that you hear in speeches on the \nfloor of this Senate.\n  Where is the extra money coming from? It is coming across-the-board. \nA good chunk of it is coming from nonwithheld income taxes, and that \nwould be from capital gains dividends, higher than expected small \nbusiness income. No one should be surprised by these developments. They \nare consistent with economic and fiscal history. The bottom line is \nthat when the economy grows, the Federal Treasury benefits as well.\n  That is shown very clearly on this chart. Over 40 years, up until \nnow--and beyond that, guessing what the economy might do for another 10 \nyears--we see the green line here, the gross domestic product, the \nmeasure of it on a yearly average. That is the green line. It is fairly \nconstant, not so erratic.\n  The revenues coming in are the red lines. That tends to be much more \ndramatically different from year to year than what the GDP measurement \nis. You can see here, going back 40 years, when the GDP goes down, you \nhave a very dramatic drop in taxes coming into the Federal Treasury.\n  When they go up, you have a much more dramatic increase in taxes \ncoming into the Federal Treasury. You can see that several times--quite \na drop here in the gross domestic product but a very dramatic drop in \nincome coming in.\n  More recently, we had the Clinton recession that we inherited, plus \n9/11. So you find a dip in the gross domestic product here, but, boy, \nyou see a very dramatic drop in the income coming in at this point.\n  We passed the tax bill of 2001, and we passed the tax bill of 2003. \nYou know that Greenspan said the growth in the economy is very related \nto those tax reductions we had at that particular time. You can see \nthat we have a rise since then in the gross domestic product. You have \na rise in income. But this chart was made before we had some more \nrecent figures.\n  This red line, the point right here, would be about right here, \nreflecting that $274 billion more coming in in 2005 over 2004. You see \na little rise in the gross domestic product, a very dramatic rise for \nthe most recent figures at this point here instead of this point here--\na more dramatic rise in the income coming into the Federal Treasury \nfrom our taxes because there was a little bit of an increase in the \neconomy.\n  People are saying here we have to increase taxes, whether it is \nautomatically or whether you vote them. You don't have to do that. You \ncan see we are projecting a very good income coming into the Federal \nTreasury just when there is a slight increase in economic growth of our \ncountry as reflected in what we call the gross domestic product.\n  Some people here have it backwards. They think Federal revenue drives \nthe economy. It is almost as though they believe raising taxes will \nlead to more growth. Growing economic activity, as shown by this chart, \nis fueling the good news on the receipt side of the Federal budget. In \nthis environment, it is a wonderment why the Democratic leadership \nwould want to send such a negative message to the financial markets.\n  Why does the Democratic leadership want to raise capital gains tax by \n33 percent and double the tax on dividends? In these uncertain times, \nwhy would the Democratic leadership want to drive a stake in the heart \nof this growing economy, not only a growing economy but a more vastly \ngrowing amount of money coming into the Federal Treasury?\n  A cynical person might feel that the Democratic leadership is only \nlooking at political gain by driving down our economy. I can't believe \nmy friends in the Democratic leadership would want to cause economic \npain for short-term political gain. But with all these speeches that \nare going on around here and all these news conferences about \nrethinking the budget, you have to wonder, don't you?\n  To sum up on my first point, the taxpayer is not the problem. The \ntaxpayer is sending plenty of money to Washington, DC by $274 billion \nmore in 2005 over 2004 with these lower levels of taxation we have. The \nrevenue side of the budget is coming in fine, way beyond expectation.\n  I will turn to the specific plan we are going to present to the \nSenate when we have this reconciled tax package out here.\n  Again, this is a tax relief plan expressed in these news conferences \nthat the Democratic leadership wants to kill. The reconciliation \ninstruction gives us the resources to maintain current law tax relief. \nPut another way, the reconciliation instructions to my committee are \nour best means to protect against tax hikes on millions of American \ntaxpayers.\n  Let us take a look at the tax increases the Democratic leadership \nwould put on the American people by inaction by this Congress--an \nautomatic tax increase. That is the Christmas present we would be \ngiving the taxpayers, if we adjourn by Thanksgiving. What a Christmas \npresent.\n  First and foremost, the tax relief plan continues to hold harmless \nfor the alternative minimum tax. This piece of the plan--the largest, I \nmight add--is worth $30 billion to 14 million American families.\n\n[[Page S11656]]\n\n  Does the Democratic leadership want to push millions of middle-income \nfamilies into the alternative minimum tax? If the answer is no, then \nthey ought to support our reconciliation bill.\n  Second, the plan extends the progrowth piece of the 2003 tax relief \nbill, specifically lower capital gains and dividend rates.\n  As the Finance Committee hearing showed earlier this year, we got \ntestimony about how these incentives have helped the stock market \nrecover. A lot of folks on Wall Street tell us they have assumed \ncontinuation of these progrowth tax relief measures in the pricing of \nstocks. Does the Democrat leadership want to play games with stock \nprices? If the answer is no, then they ought to support our \nreconciliation bill.\n  A third point: Other widely applicable tax relief benefits are \naddressed in our bill. I am talking about these middle-income tax \nbenefits we already have on the books that would expire. The \ndeductibility of college tuition, the small savers tax credit, the \nsmall business expensing--all of these provisions are bipartisan. \nMillions of taxpayers are already relying on them. Does the Democratic \nleadership want to take away the deductible for college tuition from \nfamilies who send their kids to college? Does the Democratic leadership \nwant to eliminate the small savers credit? Does the Democratic \nleadership want to take away expensing of equipment from our small \nbusiness folks and farmers? If the answer is no, then they should \nsupport our reconciliation bill.\n  The fourth example is our plan is going to address expiring business \nand individual provisions that we call extenders because we extend them \nfrom year to year or maybe 2 or 3 years at a time. But they eventually \nrun out. These provisions include the research and development tax \ncredit, the State sales tax deductibility from the Federal income tax, \nand the deduction of teachers' out-of-pocket expenses.\n  As I noted, the Democratic leader did not come out and say he would \nsupport taking a look at some of these regular extenders, but they are \na small part of the picture. I note that the ranking member of the \nBudget Committee hasn't come that direction yet.\n  The Democratic leadership is not singing with one voice on this \nsubset of expiring provisions. But if we do what the Democrats said \nthey wanted to do in their news conference, these could possibly \nexpire.\n  Does the Democratic leadership then want to eliminate the research \nand development tax credit? Does the Democratic leadership want to \neliminate the sales tax deduction from the Federal income tax? Does the \nDemocratic leadership want to eliminate the deduction for teachers' \nout-of-pocket expenses? If the answer is no, then they ought to help us \nget this budget tax reconciliation bill passed. These are all about \ngrowth of the economy.\n  In the Midwest, farmers--and I am one of them--have a saying: Don't \neat your seed corn. Keep planting seed corn. That makes the economy \nstrong. The tax relief seeds we planted a few years ago are yielding, \nas you can see here, a good harvest of revenue to the Federal Treasury.\n  What it comes down to is this: We need to take care of legislative \nbusiness. We need to continue the tax relief promised to the American \npeople and not let it expire, not let there be an automatic tax \nincrease. If there is going to be an automatic tax increase, it ought \nto be voted by Congress. We ought to have guts enough to increase the \ntaxes.\n  But we are better off with a plan that stops this automatic tax \nincrease. The revenue side of the budget is performing fine, as you can \nsee here. The American taxpayer is doing his or her share by the tune \nof $274 billion more coming in this year, 2005, over 2004. Now is not \nthe time to shortchange the American taxpayers by raising their tax \nburden, particularly on middle-income taxpayers.\n  I ask my friends in the Democratic leadership to please refrain from \nraising taxes on millions of middle-income Americans. It is simple: \nMaintain existing levels of taxation. You do that by supporting the \nreconciliation bill that will be coming before this Congress shortly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/20/senate-section/article/S11656-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CHICAGO WHITE SOX ADVANCE TO THE WORLD SERIES\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a matter of great \nimportance to the people of the State of Illinois. For the first time \nsince 1959, the era of the ``Go-Go Sox,'' the Chicago White Sox are \nheaded to the World Series. The White Sox will face the Houston Astros, \nwho last night beat the St. Louis Cardinals and clinched the National \nLeague pennant. We are disappointed; an I-55 World Series would have \nbeen great. But the Cards are a great team, Tony La Russa is a great \nmanager, and they will be back.\n  I didn't grow up in Chicago, I grew up in east St. Louis, but one of \nthe first things I learned about Chicago is that the people of that \ncity are absolutely passionate about baseball. I have also learned that \nChicagoans don't ask you which team you love. They want to know which \nteam you hate--except this time. Today, we are all White Sox fans. As \nlong-time Sox fans are painfully aware, the White Sox have not won a \nWorld Series since 1917. Their three-game sweep in the playoffs against \nthe defending World Series champion Boston Red Sox was the first step \nin exorcising the ghost of Shoeless Joe Jackson and that controversial \n1919 White Sox team that was branded the ``Black Sox.''\n  It was clutch hitting and pitching that helped this year's White Sox \nbeat the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, four games to one, to advance \nto the World Series. In four consecutive playoff games this year, White \nSox pitchers threw complete games, a record not matched since the 1956 \nYankees.\n  Speaking of outstanding pitchers, I congratulate my colleague, \nSenator Barack Obama. He threw out the opening pitch in game 2 of the \nplayoffs. Before that pitch, the White Sox were trailing the Angels one \ngame to nothing. But after Senator Obama's blazing pitch, the Sox came \nback to win four games in a row and clinch the American League pennant. \nRumor has it that if the going gets rough in the World Series, the Sox \nare going to turn to Barack Obama if they need a strong southpaw.\n  White Sox players will be among the first to tell you: The upcoming \nWorld Series is not just a tribute to their outstanding performance. \nThis historic event is a tribute to great White Sox players of the past \nwho came so close only to fall short. They include Ozzie Guillen, who \nis now the White Sox manager, and, of course, Frank Thomas, their \ninjured star--both White Sox stalwarts in the 1980s and 1990s.\n  Most of all, this historic World Series is a reward to the millions \nof White Sox fans who have stood by their team year after year, decade \nafter decade, during seasons of 90-plus wins and 90-plus losses.\n  I applaud especially general manager Kenny Williams for helping to \nput this great team together; my personal friends, the owners of the \nWhite Sox, Jerry Reinsdorf and Eddie Einhorn, for their undying \ncommitment to building a championship team on the South Side of \nChicago. They orchestrated strategic moves to bring improved speed, \ndefense, and pitching to the daily lineup in the form of players such \nas Scott Podsednik and Jose Contreras whose outstanding performance \ncomplemented veteran Sox such as American League playoff MVP Paul \nKonerko and All-Star Game starting pitcher Mark Buehrle.\n  When spring training opens next spring, Illinoisans will once again \nbe divided between Cubs fans, White Sox fans, and Cardinal fans, too. \nBut today, we are all pulling for the White Sox as they fight to bring \nto Chicago the city's first baseball World Series championship in 88 \nyears. For Cardinal red and Cubby blue, the choice is black and white. \nGo Sox.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/20/senate-section/article/S11656-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11656-S11657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES EXTENSION\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

KOCH\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the late William A. \nKoch for his contributions to preserving the memory and legacy of \nPresident Abraham Lincoln's early life.\n  Mr. Koch was a man of vision, integrity, and generosity. Born in \nSanta Claus, IN, Mr. Koch worked throughout his life to establish the \nLincoln Boyhood National Memorial in order to secure a place to \npreserve the legacy of Lincoln's years in Indiana.\n  William Koch headed the effort to incorporate the Nancy Hanks State \nMemorial into the National Park Service and led a campaign for the \npassage of a bill to establish the Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial. \nMr. Koch's efforts were so integral to the passage of the bill that he \nwas invited to witness its signing by President Kennedy on February 19, \n1962.\n  Today, visitors from across the country travel to Indiana where the \nVisitor Center and Living History Farm reveal the importance of \nLincoln's Indiana years in his development from boyhood to the man he \nbecame.

Mr. President, I rise today to highlight the issue of \nunderage drinking. The statistics are startling. According to the \nNational Institute on Drug Abuse, on average, children first use \nalcohol around age 12, and research tells us that the majority of kids \nare obtaining the alcohol they drink from family and friends. According \nto Teenage Research Unlimited, 51 percent of 13- to 15-year-olds say \nthey will face a decision regarding alcohol in the next 3 months.\n  In my State of Colorado, the most recent data we have available \nreveals that underage drinking is on the rise. In 2003, 21 percent of \nchildren ages 12 to 17 reported having consumed alcohol in the past \nmonth--an increase of 3 percent from the previous year.\n  In addition, Colorado's Youth Risk Behavior Survey, completed by over \n700 Colorado high school students, found that only 19 percent of \nstudents have never tried alcohol. Conversely, 29 percent reported \nbinge drinking, defined as having consumed five or more alcoholic \ndrinks on one or more occasions during the 30 days preceding the \nsurvey. Tragically, five college students died in Colorado last year \ndue to binge drinking.\n  As policy makers but more importantly, as parents--these statistics \nshould alarm us all. As the father of two teenage daughters, I worry \nbecause I know alcohol abuse is frequently a precursor to use and abuse \nof illegal drugs and other dangerous behavior. The good news is that \nparents are the leading influence on a child's decision not to drink \nalcohol. It is critical that parents and other trusted adults initiate \nconversations with children about underage drinking well in advance of \nthe first time they are faced with a decision regarding alcohol.\n  Earlier this week, my colleagues from Congressional Hispanic Caucus \nteamed up with The Century Council and Nickelodeon to cast a spotlight \non underage drinking in the Hispanic community.\n  We all know that the Hispanic population is growing in the United \nStates. In Colorado, Hispanics represent almost 20 percent of the total \npopulation. Because the Hispanic community is a younger community, we \nhave the ability and the obligation to influence the lives of these and \nall children, and to prevent them from engaging in dangerous activities \nsuch as underage drinking.\n  With the launch of Pregunte, Escuche, Aprenda: Los ninos y el alcohol \nno mezclan!, Hispanic parents and their middle-school-aged children \nwill have access to critical information on the negative consequences \nof underage drinking. The program is designed to reduce underage \ndrinking, particularly among children ages 9 to 13. The information is \nuseful for parents, other trusted adults and kids, and includes \nstrategies to help facilitate conversations about the dangers of \nunderage drinking.\n  It was developed in collaboration with several national Hispanic \norganizations, including the League of United Latin American Citizens, \nLULAC, the Aspira Association, the National Latino Children's \nInstitute, the National Hispanic Medical Association and MANA, among \nothers, and is a culturally and linguistically adapted version of their \nAsk, Listen, Learn: Kids and Alcohol Don't Mix program.\n  I commend The Century Council and Nickelodeon for giving Hispanic \nparents and children across the Nation such a valuable communications \ntool to initiate those critically important discussions regarding \nalcohol.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/20/senate-section/article/S11657-3", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  While leaving a bar on March 1, 2004, in Morgantown, WV, three men \nwere attacked, two of whom are gay. Christopher Barnhart and his \nfriends heard someone use homophobic language toward them. Barnhart was \nsubsequently attacked and knocked to the ground, suffering two facial \nfractures. When Barnhart's friend tried to come to his assistance, he \nwas attacked and suffered bruised ribs and a cut ear as a result.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/20/senate-section/article/S11657-4", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11657-S11658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                          Larry W. Pankey, Jr.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to remember the life and \nsacrifice of a Coloradan who has made us all proud: SGT Larry W. \nPankey, Jr., of Morrison, CO. Sergeant Pankey was a member of the 467th \nEngineer Battalion, U.S. Army Reserve, based out of Mississippi.\n  Sergeant Pankey died earlier this month in support of Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. He was only 34. He died serving this country with courage, \nself sacrifice and dignity, gifts which we as a nation are profoundly \ngrateful to receive.\n  Sergeant Pankey is not alone in this sacrifice. Across Colorado and \nAmerica, men and women have answered the call and risen on our behalf. \nThey have not done so for glory or recognition, but because they share \nthe fundamental belief that freedom and liberty are worth fighting for. \nThey have come from farms and ranches in places like Colorado's eastern \nplains and apartment buildings in cities like Denver, from living rooms \nand bedrooms and classrooms across this country.\n  The sons and daughters of America have stood united to defend our way \nof\n\n[[Page S11658]]\n\nlife and the values that we all share. The call to a service greater \nthan their own self interest has motivated them to risk their lives. \nAll too often, we are unable to repay them for the sacrifices that they \nmake.\n  Next month we will recognize Veterans Day. It will be marked by \npatriotic speeches and parades, a solemn recognition of those veterans \nwho are still with us and those servicemembers who have been lost. And \nrightfully so. But we should not lose sight of the fact that every day \nthere are still families grieving and remembering.\n  To Sergeant Pankey's wife and daughter in Morrison and his mother in \nLouisiana, and all of the families and friends left behind in the wake \nof a soldier's death, we can only offer our humble thanks on behalf of \nthis Nation. We are forever in your debt and will always remember the \nextraordinary price you have paid on our behalf by offering up your \nsons and daughters. We will keep you in our thoughts and prayers.\n  With that in mind, I want to end with a quote from the Bible upon \nwhich I sometimes reflect when I am thinking about our men and women in \nuniform. Matthew 5:9 reminds us: ``Blessed are the peacemakers: for \nthey shall be called the children of God.''\n  Right now across the world, the members of our Armed Forces like \nSergeant Pankey stand watch on our behalf. They are these very \npeacemakers, and their place will always be reserved in our hearts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/20/senate-section/article/S11658-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     ARCTIC REFUGE PROVISIONS IN BUDGET RECONCILIATION LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, last month people from across the \ncountry converged on Washington to send a clear message to Congress in \nopposition to drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. \nSadly, yesterday's action by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee \nflies in the face of that grassroots movement. And on top of this, the \ncommittee failed to accept commonsense amendments that would have \nrequired that drilling in the Arctic follow the same rules as drilling \nin all other wildlife refuges, insisted that oil taken from the refuge \nstay in the hands of Americans, and guaranteed what Senators have been \ntold all along--that 50 percent of the revenues from leases would go to \nthe Federal Treasury, despite public suggestions by Members of the \nAlaska delegation that the State would sue to get 90 percent of all \nrevenues.\n  There is no doubt that as a nation, we face tough questions about our \nenergy policy. Sacrificing one of America's greatest natural treasures, \nhowever, to access a supply of oil that may not last more than a year, \nwouldn't be available for many years to come, and would decrease gas \nprices by only a penny at its highest production, is simply not the \nanswer. A responsible, well-thought-out national energy policy that \nmoves us away from our dependence on a finite resource such as oil is \nthe answer, and I regret that we don't have such a policy. To support \nour energy needs, care for our citizens, encourage a vibrant economy, \nand meet our stewardship responsibilities to future generations, we \nmust take a variety of steps, including investing in American \ningenuity, advancing our commitment to conservation, and increasing our \nuse of renewable sources of fuel.\n  As we now move from the committee's reconciliation recommendation to \nfloor debate of the larger budget reconciliation package, I will work \nto make sure that we do not discard the legacy of protecting the Arctic \nRefuge that dates back to President Eisenhower in 1960.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/20/senate-section/article/S11658-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL SAFE SCHOOLS WEEK\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, October 16-22 is National Safe Schools \nWeek. School violence, or even the threat of school violence, in too \nmany of our schools instills fear in our students, and limits their \nability to learn. It also can threaten and intimidate teachers and make \ninstruction more difficult.\n  National Safe Schools Week is intended to raise awareness of school \nsafety issues and empower students, parents, teachers, and parents to \ndo what they can to prevent violence in their schools. Congress should \nalso do its part by passing common sense gun safety legislation and by \nfunding important programs that help to reduce school violence.\n  According to 2003 statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, more than 950,000 students take a weapon to school each \nmonth, resulting in more than 1,400,000 students being injured or \nthreatened with a weapon during the school year. In addition, every \nmonth, an estimated 840,000 students feel too unsafe to go to school. \nThis is a problem which left unaddressed will continue to hold children \nback from reaching their full educational potential.\n  Statistics cited by the PAX organization, one of the organizers of \nNational Safe Schools Week, indicate that in 81 percent of the school \nshootings in our country, the attackers told other students of their \nplans prior to the attack. Further, students are responsible for \ntipping off school authorities in 93 percent of the cases where weapons \nare confiscated from students at school. To strengthen this fact, PAX \ncreated the Speak Up Campaign. The centerpiece of the campaign is a \nnational hotline, 1-866-SPEAK-UP, where children and teenagers can call \nto anonymously report threats involving weapons at their school. Since \nthe creation of the hotline in 2002, the Speak Up Campaign has received \nmore than 7,000 calls which were then passed along to appropriate law \nenforcement officials.\n  School violence threatens to put our children's safety and ability to \nlearn in jeopardy. Our Nation's schools need our help to combat this \nongoing problem. To start, we should adequately fund Federal grant \nprograms like COPS. COPS hiring grants have been used to hire more than \n6,500 school resource officers since 1999. These officers help ensure a \nsafe environment in and around our schools and collaborate with the \nschool community to more effectively deal with school violence issues.\n  We should also support common sense gun storage requirements to make \nit more difficult for children and teenagers to access guns and \nammunition. Recently, I joined with 69 of my colleagues in voting for \nan amendment offered by Senator Kohl that would require licensed \ndealers, manufacturers, and importers to include a safe gun storage or \ngun safety device with every handgun they sell. Use of such storage \ndevices could help prevent a child or teenager from acquiring a gun \nthat they might use to injure or kill another student at school. \nHopefully, Senator Kohl's amendment will become law.\n  School violence has always posed a threat to students and teachers, \nbut lethal and easily concealable guns have escalated the problem. Gun \nviolence, not only affects students at a particular school, it has a \nrippling effect on students at schools in the same county, State, and \nin some cases, the entire country. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting efforts to reduce the threat of violence, especially gun \nviolence, to our schools.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/20/senate-section/article/S11658-3", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11658-S11659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONTINUED JAPANESE BAN ON U.S. BEEF\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to express deep frustration \nover Japan's unwillingness to lift its ban on U.S. beef. My patience--\nand the patience of many of colleagues in this chamber--has run out. \nThe time for talk and empty promises is over.\n  I have long been, and remain, a friend of Japan. I first visited that \ncountry many years ago as a student and was deeply touched by the \nkindness extended to me by the people of Japan. In over 30 years in \nCongress, I have worked hard to strengthen our trade and economic ties. \nI have watched proudly as the U.S.-Japan economic relationship has \ngrown and prospered.\n  Times have not always been easy. I have engaged closely on U.S.-Japan \nissues through good times and through periods of great strain. But even \nin the most difficult times, I have made every effort to roll up my \nsleeves and work through problems in order to ensure that our trade \nrelationship with Japan works for the people of Montana and the United \nStates.\n  By and large, that relationship works, and it works well. In trade, \none of our crowning achievements together has been the construction of \na rules-based multilateral trading system--first through the General \nAgreement\n\n[[Page S11659]]\n\non Tariffs and Trade, and now through the World Trade Organization. \nWithout Japan's leadership and cooperation during the Tokyo Round, the \nUruguay Round, and now in the Doha Round, it would have been \ndifficult--if not impossible--to craft the important rules that govern \nworld trade.\n  It is therefore with bitter disappointment that I stand here today on \nthe Senate floor to draw attention to Japan's failure to play by the \nrules that it helped to create. Japan has banned U.S. beef from its \nmarket since December 2003. That ban--almost 2 years old--costs the \nU.S. cattle and beef industries hundreds of millions of dollars each \nmonth. That ban puts at risk jobs in American ranches. And that ban--\nwith absolutely no basis in science--is unsustainable under \ninternational trade law.\n  In the 2 years since the ban was put in place, I have traveled to \nJapan to meet personally with Japan's trade and agriculture ministers \nto argue for lifting the ban on U.S. beef. I have met with the Japanese \nambassador to press Japan to lift its ban. I have taken senior \nofficials from Japan and other countries that ban U.S. beef to Montana, \nand fed them Montana beef on a Montana ranch, to encourage them to lift \nthe ban. And I have urged President Bush, Agriculture Secretary \nJohanns, U.S. Trade Representative Portman, and other senior \nadministration officials to make lifting the Japanese ban on U.S. beef \na top priority.\n  At first, I was encouraged by what appeared to be steps that Japan \nwas taking to lift this ban. The United States and Japan even signed an \nagreement in October 2004 to remove the ban. At that time and since, I \nwas repeatedly assured by Japanese officials that, under this \nagreement, the Japanese government would set up a ``scientific'' \nprocess to determine when and how to resume imports of U.S. beef \nproducts.\n  It is now one year later, and still nothing. Instead, it now looks to \nme like that Japan's administrative process has become an exercise of \nsmoke and mirrors. Japan says the right things. But its action--or \nactually inaction--has been far more telling.\n  Let me assure my Japanese counterparts, there is no higher quality, \nsafer, or better tasting beef in the world. I eat it. My family eats \nit. Japanese visitors to the United States eat it. Japanese students \nliving in the United States eat it. Many beef eaters around the world \nprefer and consume U.S. beef. Yet, despite scientific proof of the \nsafety of U.S. beef, there has been no quality Montanan or other \nAmerican beef imported into Japan in almost 2 years.\n  I can no longer accept assurances from the Japanese government that \nit will lift the ban. Montana's ranchers have heard enough vague \npromises during the last two years. We're fed up. The time for idle \npromises is over. It is now time for action.\n  I therefore call upon the United States Trade Representative to \nsanction Japan for maintaining its ban on U.S. beef. The United States \nshould impose sanctions on Japanese products imported into the United \nStates in an amount equal to the losses suffered by the U.S. beef and \ncattle industries.\n  This is a blunt instrument. But it appears to be the only recourse \nleft. I will no longer sit by and watch Japan flout its international \ntrade obligations behind the smokescreen that it is engaged in a \nlengthy ``process'' to lift the ban.\n  Sanctioning Japan without resort to WTO dispute settlement is not \nideal. It's not how the WTO is supposed to work. But U.S. beef \nproducers should not be forced to wait the years it would take to \ncomplete a WTO case. They have waited long enough. I will not wring my \nhands over legal niceties when the livelihoods of ranchers in Montana \nand across the United States are at stake.\n  In my experience, the only thing that will get the Japanese to act is \nleverage. And sanctions are leverage.\n  We have been here before. In the late 1980s, Japan kept its market \nalmost entirely closed to U.S. beef. U.S. beef producers were permitted \nto export only six ounces per Japanese citizen per year, a piddling \namount. The excuse then was that Japanese intestines were somehow \n``different'' and therefore unsuitable to digesting American beef.\n  I didn't accept that ridiculous excuse. Instead, I pushed hard for \nlegislation that would penalize Japanese imports. Soon thereafter, the \nJapanese opened their market to U.S. beef.\n  And I don't accept this excuse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/20/senate-section/article/S11659-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11659-S11660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE 15TH ANNUAL WALLENBERG MEDAL\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last Tuesday evening, the University of \nMichigan presented Paul Rusesabagina with its 15th Annual Wallenberg \nMedal. As my colleagues may remember, Mr. Rusesabagina was the subject \nof the movie ``Hotel Rwanda.''\n  The Wallenberg Medal is named for University of Michigan alumnus and \nhumanitarian Raoul Wallenberg. After receiving his degree in \narchitecture in 1935, he spent time in several jobs in South Africa and \nPalestine before moving to Sweden in 1941 to work for a Jewish \nHungarian businessman named Kalman Lauer. Lauer operated an export-\nimport firm which did business in Central Europe, a large portion of \nwhich took place in Hungary. As the Nazis continued to gain power in \nEurope, Lauer found it increasingly difficult to travel and turned over \ncontrol of his foreign division to Wallenberg. In 1944, Wallenberg was \napproached by the American War Refugee Board to take part in a plan to \nassist Jews in Budapest who were in danger of falling victim to the \nholocaust.\n  Wallenberg agreed to take part in the project and was sent to \nBudapest as a representative of the Swedish Government. In Budapest, \nWallenberg hired several hundred Jews to staff his office, bringing \nthem under the diplomatic protection of Sweden. Additionally, he \ncreated a new official looking Swedish passport, known as the \n``Schutzpass.'' Wallenberg gave the Schutzpass to thousands of \nHungarian Jews and said that it granted the holder immunity from Nazi \ndeportation. The Schutzpass deceived the Nazis and may have saved the \nlives of as many as 20,000 Jews.\n  Wallenberg is also known to have rented 32 buildings in Budapest, \nwhich he declared to be under the diplomatic protection of the Swedish \nGovernment. Using his architectural education from the University of \nMichigan, he took space designed to hold no more than 5,000 people and \nturned it into housing for more than 35,000 Jews. These ``safe houses'' \nprovided a refuge of last resort for thousands who would have otherwise \ndisappeared into Nazi death camps.\n  There are numerous stories of Wallenberg's courage and heroism \nthroughout the last few years of World War II. Despite repeated threats \nand attempts on his life, he persevered and continued his work to save \nas many Jews as possible. Wallenberg is best known for skillful \nnegotiation and fearless confrontation of Nazi soldiers who threatened \nthe safety of those he was working to protect. Tragically, Wallenberg \ndisappeared soon after Soviet soldiers took control of Budapest.\n  While the circumstances surrounding Wallenberg's disappearance are \nstill unclear, the tens of thousands of Jews he saved from certain \ndeath will never forget his brave actions. The University of Michigan \ncreated the Wallenberg Medal in 1990 to honor his memory and recognize \nother outstanding humanitarian leaders. Each year the Wallenberg Medal \nis presented to an individual who has exhibited extraordinary respect \nfor human rights on behalf of those subjected to persecution. Medal \nrecipients are chosen to honor their self-sacrifice, integrity, and \ncourage in standing up to an oppressive majority. Following the \npresentation, the Wallenberg Medal recipient is invited to address an \naudience of students, faculty, and members of the community regarding \ntheir experiences and humanitarian work. Past Wallenberg Medal \nrecipients include the Dalai Lama, Nobel-laureate and holocaust \nsurvivor Elie Wiesel, civil rights leader and Congressman John Lewis, \nand other extraordinary humanitarians.\n  This year's Wallenberg Medal recipient Paul Rusesabagina has \ncertainly exhibited qualities worthy of such a high honor. Rusesabagina \nwas the manager of the Hotel des Mille Collines in Kigali, Rwanda in \n1994 when the assassination of Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana \npushed an already tense situation in the country over the edge. Radical \nethnic Hutus began rounding up and murdering their Tutsi rivals as well \nas other moderate Hutus who did not support their actions. It is \nestimated that nearly one million people\n\n[[Page S11660]]\n\nwere killed in the violence in only 100 days.\n  Paul Rusesabagina did not stand by and watch as his countrymen were \nmurdered. As a well-connected Hutu, Rusesabagina was spared \npersecution. However, his wife, a Tutsi, and his children were not \nsafe. He moved them from his home to the Hotel des Mille Collines where \nhe believed they would be safer. As the violence intensified, he opened \nthe hotel to hundreds of other Rwandans, Hutu and Tutsi alike, who were \nseeking to escape the violence outside. In the following months, there \nwere numerous attempts to force those at the hotel out into the streets \nof Kigali. Each time, Rusesabagina used his international connections \nthrough the hotel or with the Rwandan military in combination with keen \nnegotiation skills to spare the lives of those he was caring for. \nAmazingly, no one who took shelter inside the hotel was killed in the \nviolence. In all, Paul Rusesabagina and the Hotel des Mille Collines \nprotected the lives of more than 1,200 people during the genocide.\n  Prior to the award ceremony last Tuesday, Paul Rusesabagina was \nreunited with one of the many who took shelter at the Hotel des Mille \nCollines. According to reports, Thomas Kamilindi was working as a \njournalist in Kigali when violence broke out in 1994. Kamilindi, his \npregnant wife and young daughter stayed at the hotel for a month and a \nhalf until they were evacuated. Kamilindi credits Paul Rusesabagina \nwith saving his life and the lives of his family. The meeting last \nTuesday was the first since Kamilindi and his family were evacuated \nmore than 10 years ago. Following their meeting, Kamilindi said, ``It \nwas very emotional for him and for me. I am still alive because Paul \nwas there.'' Kamilindi is currently a Knight-Wallace Journalism Fellow \nat the University of Michigan where he is studying representations of \nviolence in the media.\n  Paul Rusesabagina's courageous actions closely resemble those of \nRaoul Wallenberg 50 years before. Both men stood in the face of great \nadversity to protect those who were not able to protect themselves. \nLike Wallenberg, Rusesabagina provided a shelter of last resort to \ninnocent civilians facing persecution, many of whom he did not know \npersonally prior to the violence. In addition, both men fought off \npotential violence not by meeting force with force, but by using \npersuasion, influence, and negotiation instead.\n  I thank the University of Michigan for adding to the legacy of Raoul \nWallenberg by recognizing the contributions of other great \nhumanitarians like Paul Rusesabagina. I know my colleagues will join me \nin congratulating Paul Rusesabagina on this great honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/20/senate-section/article/S11660-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           CONGRATULATING HAWAII'S NATIONAL SOCCER CHAMPIONS\n\n Mr. AKAKA.

Katrina Chong's goal in \nthe first half off an assist by Alana Wall would be the game's only \nscore.\n  The Honolulu Bulls Soccer Club ('88 Girls) team members are: Lucy \nCaires, CiAnna Chun-Ming, Kelsi Chan, Katrina Chong, Devin Council, \nCaycie Gusman, Allison Haines, Jaymie Honold, Ashley Kanda, Lauren \nKanda, Sophia Merrifield, Marisa Schoen, Carly Wachi, Alana Wall, \nLindsey Watanabe, Jordan Weeks, Jenna Wong, Kiani Wong, and Marie \nYempuku. The team is coached by Phil Neddo, Craig Nosse, and Robin \nMcCullough.\n  I congratulate the Honolulu Bulls Soccer Club ('88 Girls) on their \nthrilling run to the top of their sport, and I wish all of them the \nbest in their future endeavors, in life and on the playing field. And I \nextend the same congratulations to all players and coaches who \nparticipated in this year's U.S. Club Soccer National Cup IV Finals on \na job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/20/senate-section/article/S11660-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    LEVI LEIPHEIMER APPRECIATION DAY\n\n Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor Mrs. Cora \nGay, a resident of Albany, GA, who passed away on September 25, 2005. \nMrs. Gay was a devoted wife and mother who touched many lives with her \npositive and compassionate personality. She married the love of her \nlife, Quincy Gay, on December 1, 1929, and they celebrated their 75th \nanniversary this past December. During their marriage, they raised \nthree sons and a daughter. They also have 17 grandchildren, 18 great-\ngrandchildren, and 2 great-great- grandchildren.\n  Mrs. Gay graduated from Albany State University in 1948 with a degree \nin elementary education. She then spent the next 25 years of her career \ninspiring and bringing out the best in her students in the Miller and \nDougherty County school systems. She was a member of many organizations \nwhile teaching, including: Dougherty County Teachers League; president \nof the Dougherty County 2nd Grade Educators; Georgia Association of \nEducators; National Education Association; Association of Classroom \nTeachers and the National Council of English Teachers. In 1962, she was \nnamed ``River Road Elementary Teacher of the Year'' and was named as an \n``Outstanding Elementary Teacher of America'' in 1972. She retired from \nteaching in 1973 and had a youth award named after her in 1991.\n  Cora's passions were cooking, sewing, reading, playing scrabble, and \nhelping others. She was always there to provide comfort and strength to \nmembers of her family and others in her community when they were in \nneed. On September 25 we lost a truly fine Georgian and great American. \nI commend her to her family, friends, and colleagues as an example of a \nlife fully and successfully lived.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/20/senate-section/article/S11660-4", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11660-S11661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING MARY BOURDETTE\n\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am delighted today to honor \nMary Bourdette, a woman who has dedicated her working life to improving \nthe lives of disadvantaged children and families.\n  Over the past three decades, Mary has served as a tireless and \nextremely effective advocate for our Nation's most vulnerable children. \nOur country is in her debt, and for her passion, commitment, service, \nand good humor, she will be dearly missed when she retires.\n\n[[Page S11661]]\n\n  Early in her career, Mary worked in Washington, DC, with the Legal \nServices Corporation, an organization that provides high quality legal \nservices to low-income people throughout the United States. She then \nwent to work for the Child Welfare League of America, CWLA, as the \ndirector of public policy. In this role, Mary was a committed champion \nas she worked masterfully and persistently to seek and implement policy \nimprovements for abused and neglected children.\n  Mary then took her passion and talent to the Children's Defense Fund, \nCDF, where she served as a powerful ally to children for 8 years. I \nfirst got to know Mary at CDF where she worked to improve the Head \nStart program by increasing funds dedicated to strengthening the \nquality of Head Start and maintaining its comprehensive approach to \nhelping our poorest children and families. Mary was the driving force \nbehind the Act for Better Child Care and worked overtime to help build \nsupport for the Family and Medical Leave Act.\n  I had the pleasure of continuing to work with Mary when she became \nDeputy Assistant Secretary for Legislation with the Health and Human \nServices office under Secretary Shalala. Mary was endlessly positive \nand always on the search for solutions. As she was always upbeat, it \nwas a genuine pleasure to work with her. Mary seemed to wake up every \nday believing that it held an opportunity to make the world better for \nchildren.\n  She played a critically important role in the enactment of the \nAdoption and Safe Families Act, which helped to realize the goals of \nsafety, permanence and well-being for tens of thousands of children in \nthe child welfare system. During the negotiation of this bill at the \nvery end of the congressional session in 1996, Mary was the Clinton \nadministration's lead diplomat on Capitol Hill. I was keenly interested \nin the passage of this legislation, and Mary worked diligently, keeping \nme informed every step of the way and late into the night, as was her \nusual style, to forge a bipartisan compromise.\n  While serving as Deputy Assistant Secretary, Mary help lead the \nextraordinary effort to expand the child care and development block \ngrant, CCDBG, ensuring that this bill included adequate funding for \nlow-income families. She was also deeply involved in the dramatic \nexpansion of the earned income tax credit, EITC, a credit that provides \ncrucial income support to millions of low-income individuals and \nfamilies. Since its inception, the EITC has been hailed as one of the \nmost effective antipoverty policies ever created, and Mary was integral \nto its success.\n  Most recently, I had the pleasure of partnering with Mary in her \ncapacity as director of government relations for Parents Action for \nChildren. Together we sought to highlight the dangers of exposure to \nviolent and explicit video games to children. As she has been \nthroughout her career, Mary was acutely focused on protecting children \nand empowering parents. I knew from working with Mary in the past that \nher involvement in this endeavor would not only ensure that it was done \nwell but that working with her would be a real joy.\n  Any one who has had the pleasure of working with her would agree that \nMary is not only consistently creative but also proactive and \ndetermined to improve the lives of our Nation's young people. Mary has \nalways been a pleasure to work with; her wonderful sense of humor and a \nreassuring smile encourages everyone in her presence. After she \nretires, those of us fortunate enough to have known and worked closely \nwith Mary will dearly miss her keen understanding of policy, her gentle \nmanner and, most importantly, her deep commitment to children. Millions \nmore whose her work she has touched--though they may never know her \nname--will miss the rare combination of caring and talent that Mary \nbrought to her hard work on their behalf.\n  Long after her retirement, Mary will remain an inspiration for our \nefforts as we continue the fight for America's most vulnerable \nchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/20/senate-section/article/S11661-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING DR. WILLIAM T. SMITH\n\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize an outstanding leader in the field of long-\nterm care and aging services. Dr. William T. Smith is the outgoing \nchair of the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, \nAAHSA, and I congratulate him on what has been accomplished during his \n2-year term.\n  AAHSA serves 2 million people every day through mission-driven, not-\nfor-profit organizations dedicated to providing the services people \nneed, when they need them, in the place they call home. AAHSA provides \na continuum of aging services ranging from assisted living residences, \ncontinuing care retirement communities, and nursing homes to home and \ncommunity based programs, and senior housing. AAHSA is committed to \ncreating the future of aging services through high-quality people can \ntrust.\n  Under Dr. Smith's chairmanship, AAHSA has taken a leadership role in \nchanging the culture of long-term care toward providing consumer \noriented services in the most appropriate settings. An important \nelement has been the Quality First Initiative, under which AAHSA \nmembers commit to continuous quality improvement in clinical care, \nleadership, governance, accountability, and several other elements of \nquality care. Dr. Smith has overseen the appointment of an independent \nNational Commission on Quality Long-Term Care, which will evaluate the \nquality of long-term care, identify factors influencing the ability to \nimprove quality of care nationally, and make recommendations about \nnational efforts for sustainable quality improvement.\n  Dr. Smith's term as chair has also seen the development of the Center \nfor Aging Services Technology, a major new initiative bringing together \nresearchers from universities, technology companies, facility \nadministrators and government representatives. The center focuses on \nthe application of technology to provide aging services more \neffectively and affordably and to enable older Americans to maintain \nmaximum independence, regardless of the setting in which they live.\n  In addition to serving as AAHSA's chair, Dr. Smith is the president \nand chief executive officer of Aging in America, Inc., in Bronx, NY. \nAging in America is the parent corporation of Aging in America \nCommunity Services, AIA Supportive Services, Hertlin House, Morningside \nat Home, and Morningside House Nursing Home, whose roots date back to \nthe 1850s. Together, these facilities provide nursing, social services, \nadult day services, rehabilitation, pharmaceuticals, recreation, and \npastoral care annually to over 5,000 seniors and their families. All \nare nonprofit, nonsectarian agencies. Aging in America is another \nexample of the way in which the field of long-term care and aging \nservices must both diversify and integrate to provide a seamless \ncontinuum of options to tomorrow's seniors.\n  Dr. Smith has been in the field of social work since 1971, with the \nlast 27 years dedicated to the field of gerontology. He is a licensed \nnursing home administrator, a certified social worker, and a certified \nretirement housing professional. He clearly has been recognized both \nlocally and nationally as an expert on gerontological issues.\n  Within the next decade, the baby boom generation will move into \nretirement and approach the ages at which older adults generally come \nto need assistance with health care, housing, and supportive services. \nMany baby boomers already face these issues as their parents age. Dr. \nSmith's years of experience and his leadership in and vision for the \nfield of aging services will continue to serve seniors and policymakers \nwell as we prepare for the future of aging in America. Again, I \ncongratulate him on his many accomplishments as outgoing chair of the \nAAHSA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/20/senate-section/article/S11661-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11661-S11662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MS. JEAN GRUBB\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate a \ndistinguished Hoosier and mentor of mine, Ms. Jean Grubb, on being \nhonored with a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Indiana High School \nPress Association on October 21, 2005. Ms. Grubb, an algebra teacher \nand publications advisor for 46 years, touched hundreds of lives with \nher kindness and concern for the well\n\n[[Page S11662]]\n\nbeing of her students. I fondly remember the time we spent working \nclosely together on The Shortridge Daily Echo. While I hold those \nmemories dear, I am only one of the many students that benefited from \nher wise counsel and generous nature.\n  After graduating from Shortridge High School in 1920, where she also \nserved on the staff of The Echo as a student, Ms. Grubb went on to earn \na Bachelor of Arts degree in Mathematics from Indiana University and a \nMaster of Science degree in Journalism from Northwestern University. \nMs. Grubb began her teaching career in Sanborn, IN, before moving on to \nteach in Crawfordsville for 17 years and then finally settling at our \nalma mater where she taught until her retirement in 1970.\n  Ms. Grubb has always been an active member of the Shortridge High \nSchool alumni community. As publications advisor, Ms. Grubb organized \nthe 50th anniversary celebration of The Echo. She also has worked to \ngather names and contact information for the Shortridge High School \nAlumni Association so that each of us can stay closely in touch with \nour friends and classmates. Following her retirement, Ms. Grubb worked \nwith the Indiana Historical Society to compile a complete history of \nour alma mater.\n  I know that each of our fellow alumni and I are thankful for the \nremarkable impact Ms. Grubb has had as a member of the Shortridge \ncommunity and we look forward to many more opportunities to benefit \nfrom her experience as she begins her 103rd year and continues to bring \njoy to those around her.\n  I appreciate this opportunity to congratulate Ms. Jean Grubb on this \nsignal honor and wish her continuing good health and happiness among \nher many friends in the Indianapolis community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/20/senate-section/article/S11662-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING BILL T.

During his 31-year tenure, \nthe nonprofit Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center has become one of the \nmost respected blood banking facilities in the country, currently \nserving more than 220 healthcare institutions in the 24-county Texas \ngulf coast and east Texas regions. Prior to this position, he served as \ndirector of the Community Blood Bank in St. Petersburg, FL, and \ndirector of the Travis County Medical Society Blood Bank in Austin, TX. \nA past president of both the South Central Association of Blood Banks \nand the American Association of Blood Banks, and a former treasurer of \nthe American Blood Commission, Mr. Teague is also active in a number of \nprofessional organizations. He has received numerous honors throughout \nhis career and has been recognized, due to his involvement and service, \nas a leader in the Houston community.\n  Mr. Teague has dedicated both his professional career and personal \ntime to generating blood donations and encouraging others to give the \ngift of life. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring his \naccomplishments and wishing Mr. Teague well in all his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/20/senate-section/article/S11662-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  DON OVERMAN: RURAL AIRPORT CHAMPION\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I am here today to \nhonor a fellow Nebraskan, Don Overman, who has made a significant \ncontribution to maintaining commercial airline service in rural \nNebraska.\n  Mr. Overman is a former mayor of Scottsbluff, NE and currently serves \nas Chair of the Western Nebraska Regional Airport Authority Board in \nScottsbluff. For nearly two decades in his various roles Mr. Overman \nhas dedicated himself to assuring that Nebraskans are not deprived of \nhaving access to passenger airline service.\n  It can be hard for those who have never lived in sparsely populated \nareas of this country to understand just how difficult it is to provide \nservices that people in large urban areas take for granted, such as \nairline service.\n  In large urban areas, there is never a question whether citizens will \nhave ready access to airline service because of the economies of scale \nwhere expenses are offset by a large number of users. In lightly \npopulated areas where there are fewer customers, the economy of scale \ncan be nonexistent.\n  For instance, at the Western Nebraska Regional Airport in \nScottsbluff, NE, they struggle to board 10,000 airline passengers per \nyear. Compare that to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport \nin Atlanta, GA, which is the busiest airport in the world and boards, \non average, nearly 10,000 passengers per hour. Even with 10,000 \npassengers per year, the Western Nebraska Regional Airport is the third \nbusiest airport in Nebraska.\n  Residents of the Nebraska Panhandle who use Scottsbluff's Western \nNebraska Regional Airport are taxpayers, just as certain as those who \nuse Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson and, as such, deserve to have \nconvenient access to an airport.\n  The economy of scale makes convenient access a challenge. It is a \nchallenge that Don Overman has accepted. As Chair of the Airport \nAuthority Board, he has worked tirelessly to increase boardings so \nWestern Nebraska Regional Airport can be considered a primary airport \nand remain eligible for Federal funding. I have worked personally with \nhim and can attest to his perseverance and dedication.\n  Under his leadership, Western Nebraska Regional Airport will exceed \n10,000 boardings this year for the first time since 2001. This is a \nsignificant achievement which is not only important to the flying \npublic but to economic development in lesser populated areas of \nNebraska. Airports provide a vital link for business to ensure that \nthose Nebraska communities remain competitive in attracting new \nopportunities.\n  Among other achievements of Don Overman and the Western Nebraska \nRegional Airport Authority Board is the construction of a new $4.2 \nmillion terminal of which $2.7 million was funded through the Federal \nAirport Improvement Program and $1.5 million was secured through local \nfunding. This is a new facility to replace the current terminal which \ndates back to World War II. As Mr. Overman has observed in the past, \nthe first image people see when they arrive in a community is the \nairport. That first impression creates their feelings about the \ncommunity. Thanks to Mr. Overman's hard work, that first impression \nwill be a positive one which will help attract economic development and \ngrowth to the area.\n  Mr. Overman, who is often referred to fondly as Mr. Scottsbluff or \nMr. Airport, will be recognized Saturday, October 29, 2005, when the \nnew terminal is dedicated and named the ``Donald E. Overman Terminal.'' \nIt is a well-deserved honor for a man whose achievements in the past \nhave earned him recognition as the Scottsbluff Star-Herald Newspaper's \nCitizen of the Year and Citizen of the Century in Government.\n  I would like to extend my sincere congratulations to Don Overman on \nthis historic occasion. Thanks to him and the Western Nebraska Regional \nAirport Authority Board, citizens of the Nebraska Panhandle and \nsurrounding States will have a modern new building and continued access \nto commercial airline service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/20/senate-section/article/S11662-3", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11662-S11663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RECOGNIZING GRANDPARENTS AND OTHER KIN RAISING RELATIVES' CHILDREN\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue of great \nimportance that receives far too little attention. Across the country, \nmore than 6 million children live in households headed by either a \ngrandparent or another relative. About 2.5 million of these children \nlive in homes without either parent present. Regardless of the myriad \nreasons children enter relative care whether it is the death of a \nparent, neglect, or substance abuse it is never the fault of the child. \nI commend grandparents and other relatives who step forward to care for \nthese children, keeping them out of foster care while providing safe, \nstable homes, often at great personal and financial sacrifice.\n  Jackie Hope of Denver, CO, is one such grandmother. She became a \nsecond-time mother at the age of 53 when she quit her job to be a full-\ntime parent to her newborn grandson. Jackie's\n\n[[Page S11663]]\n\ndaughter became addicted to crack cocaine and left Jackie to care for \nher four children.\n  Times got even harder for Jackie when her husband of 38 years died \nand his retirement benefits ceased. Jackie was left to care for her \nfour grandchildren's growing needs with even less money.\n  Today, Jackie is well known in the Denver community as a strong \nadvocate for grandparents and other kin raising relatives' children. \nShe was a leader in advocating for more financial and emotional support \nfor the thousands of other people who find themselves in the same \nsituation. Although it has been physically, emotionally, and \nfinancially taxing, Jackie never complains--she simply continues to \nwork hard to provide a better life for herself and her grandchildren.\n  Grandparents and other relative caregivers such as Jackie often \nprovide the children in their care the best chance for a loving and \nstable childhood. Unfortunately, their hard work and dedication often \ngoes unnoticed. Today I offer my formal acknowledgement and deepest \nappreciation for the ongoing service of these caregivers to our country \nand to our Nation's most valuable asset, our children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/20/senate-section/article/S11663-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  Under authority of the order of the Senate of January 4, 2005, the \nSecretary of the Senate, on October 19, 2005, during the adjournment of \nthe Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker has signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 3971.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Gregg, and Mr. \n        Sununu):\n  S. 1898. A bill to establish the Freedom's Way National Heritage Area \nin the States of Massachusetts and New Hampshire, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to \nestablish the Freedom's Way National Heritage Area in New Hampshire and \nMassachusetts. The bill is cosponsored by Senator KENNEDY, Senator \nGREGG and Senator SUNUNU.\n  The bill proposes to establish a national heritage area including 36 \ncommunities in Massachusetts and six communities in New Hampshire. The \narea has important cultural and natural legacies that are important to \nNew England and the entire Nation. I want to highlight just a few of \nthe reasons I believe this designation makes sense.\n  The Freedom's Way is an ideal candidate because it is rich in \nhistoric sites, trails, landscapes and views. The land and the area's \nresources are pieces of American history and culture. The entire \nregion, and especially places like Lexington and Concord, is important \nto our country's founding and our political and philosophical \nprinciples. Within the 42 communities are truly special places. These \ninclude the Minuteman National Historic Park, more than 40 National \nRegister Districts and National Historic Landmarks, the Great Meadows \nNational Wildlife Refuge, Walden Pond State Reservation, Gardener State \nPark, Harvard Shaker Village and the Shirley Shaker Village.\n  In addition, there is strong grassroots support for this designation. \nThe people of these communities organized themselves in this effort and \nhave now turned to us for assistance. I hope we can provide it. \nSupporters include elected officials, people dedicated to preserving a \nsmall piece of American and New England history, and local business \nleaders. It is an honor to help their cause.\n  Finally, I am very pleased that Senators from both Massachusetts and \nNew Hampshire have embraced this proposal. I thank Senators Kennedy, \nGregg and Sununu.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Crapo, and Mr. \n        Inouye):\n  S. 1899. A bill to amend the Indian Child Protection and Family \nViolence Prevention Act to identify and remove barriers to reducing \nchild abuse, to provide for examinations of certain children, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to \nreauthorize the Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention \nAct. This bill is intended to reauthorize appropriations for child \nsexual abuse prevention and treatment grants, to identify the scope of \nchild abuse and family violence in Indian country by requiring annual \ncomprehensive data gathering, to encourage inter-agency coordination \nbetween the Indian Health Service and public and private medical or \ntreatment organizations in the treatment and examination of children \nthrough the use of telemedicine, and to conform the Act to other \nFederal child abuse reporting and confidentiality laws. The bill \nprovides a 4-year reauthorization of appropriations for the Act.\n  The Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act was \nenacted in 1990 to address findings of the Senate Select Committee on \nIndian Affairs and the Special Committee on Investigations as it \nexamined the Federal trust relationship with Indian tribes. Through \npublic hearings, these Committees found that, at the time, Indian \ncountry was a safe haven for child abuse perpetrators. I will not \nforget the testimony of parents whose children fell prey to the \nnotorious cases of multiple child sexual abuse that occurred on the \nHopi, Navajo, and Cherokee reservations over the course of many years. \nThe Federal investigation and prosecution of these crimes revealed that \nchild abuse perpetrators were aware that the conditions of reporting, \ninvestigating, and preventing crimes upon children were in such a sorry \nstate that their crimes would rarely be detected. Needless to say, the \nconsequences proved tragic to hundreds of child victims, their families \nand their communities.\n  We enacted this law to give the Federal Government an opportunity to \nmeet its responsibility to Indian children and families by establishing \npolicies and programs to prevent child abuse and family violence. To \naccomplish this, appropriations were authorized to establish prevention \nand treatment programs within the BIA and IHS. The Act also authorized \nthe BIA and IHS to assist tribes in establishing on-reservation child \nabuse prevention and treatment programs. The Act also provided criminal \nsanctions for professionals who failed to report acts of abuse or \nsuspected abuse and prescribed a child abuse reporting process for law \nenforcement.\n  I don't believe that the possible benefits of the Act have been fully \nrealized.\n\n[[Page S11667]]\n\nNeither the BIA nor the IHS have successfully requested or received \nappropriations to fully implement the programs envisioned by the Act. \nToday, tribal governments rely on special appropriations, congressional \nearmarks and piecemeal grants. And, we still do not have a firm idea of \nthe extent to which child sexual or physical abuse is occurring in \nIndian communities or the degree of success that we are having in \ntreating victims of child abuse. Surely, we can do better than this.\n  This bill provides for a comprehensive approach to gathering this \ninformation on child abuse in Indian country. Under current law, the \nFBI is responsible for gathering this data. At the time, the FBI was \nprimarily responsible for investigating acts of felony child abuse in \nIndian country. Today, we know that many Indian tribal police agencies, \noperating under Indian Self-Determination and Educational Assistance \nAct compacts and contracts, jointly investigate these felony crimes and \nthat they are also responsible for responding to and investigating \ntribal offenses. The bill requires a comprehensive sharing of numerical \ndata by all Federal, tribal and State law enforcement agencies.\n  In addition, the Act requires all local law enforcement agencies to \ndocument incidents of child abuse and to submit this documentation to \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Act, however, does not provide \nfor use of this valuable information. This bill permits the FBI to \ncontinue to gather conviction data and to make this information \navailable, on a limited basis, to specific agencies requiring such \ninformation in the course of their professional duties. It permits \nagencies to access information in the course of conducting background \nchecks on those who seek employment in an area involving children.\n  Finally, the bill authorizes the Indian Health Service to use \nadvances in telemedicine to bring expert advice and training to the \nexamination and diagnosis of child abuse. This new provision recognizes \nthat children, when victimized, require immediate and expert diagnosis \nand treatment.\n  This section will help supplement stretched or unavailable IHS \nresources in the most isolated Indian communities. This body recently \nsent a clear message on domestic violence and sexual predators. This \nbill furthers that message by continuing to protect Indian children and \nfamilies and ensuring that they continue to receive prevention and \ntreatment resources to address the impact of these crimes in their own \ncommunities. I look forward to receiving the comments from the \nAdministration and working with my colleagues toward final passage of \nthis bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. STABENOW (for herself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Dayton, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, and Mr. Corzine):\n  S. 1900. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nstabilize the amount of the medicare part B premium; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, today I am introducing the ``Keep the \nPromise of Medicare Act'' of 2006, and am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleagues Senators Kennedy, Harkin, Lautenberg, Dayton, and Corzine.\n  Retirees will see an average monthly cost-of-living-adjustment \nincrease of $39 in their Social Security checks next year. Although \nthis increase is welcome news, one-fourth of the COLA will be eaten up \nby rising Medicare Part B premiums, which will increase yet again by \ndouble-digits. And the premium for Medicare's new prescription drug \nbenefit could eat up the remainder of the Social Security increase.\n  As William D. Novelli, chief executive of AARP, said: ``A record \nincrease would usually be welcome news for America's Social Security \nbeneficiaries. But this cost-of-living adjustment is being eaten up by \nrising gasoline and heating costs, another double-digit increase in the \nmonthly Medicare Part B premium and escalating health care bills.''\n  This dramatic increase could have been avoided. CMS Administrator \nMcClellan has acknowledged after last year's record 17.5 percent \nincrease that provisions included in the 2003 Medicare law designed to \nprivatize the program directly contributed to the premium increase.\n  My legislation will limit the 2006 Part B premium increase to the \nsame level as the Social Security COLA. Without this legislation, the \nMedicare Part B premium will rise by 13 percent to more than $10, to \n$88.50 a month, in 2006.\n  ``Social Security's COLA will simply not be enough to cover the \nincreasing costs of living as an older person in America,'' said George \nJ. Kourpias, president of the Alliance for Retired Americans.\n  Adjusting the current premium is a first step, and one we must take \nimmediately. Older Americans have been struggling for too long under \nthe relentless increases in the cost of their health care and \nprescription drugs. Additionally, we should use this year to revise an \noutdated law that has led to record increase in Medicare premiums in \nthe last four years. The promise of Medicare must include protection \nfrom dramatic increases in the Part B premium.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me on this important piece of \nlegislation.\n\n                                S. 1900\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Keep the Promise of Medicare \n     Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. STABILIZATION OF MEDICARE PART B PREMIUM.\n\n       Section 1839(a)(3) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395r(a)(3)) is amended by adding at the end the following \n     new sentence: ``Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, the \n     monthly premium rate determined under this paragraph for each \n     month in 2006 may not exceed an amount equal to the monthly \n     premium rate determined under this paragraph for each month \n     in 2005 adjusted by the percentage change in the average \n     Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical \n     Workers (CPI-W) for the third quarter of 2004 to the third \n     quarter of 2005.''.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1899\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join the chairman of the \nSenate Indian Affairs Committee as original sponsor of the Indian Child \nProtection and Family Violence Prevention Act Amendments of 2005. The \nprimary goals of the Indian Child Protection and Family Violence \nPrevention Act of 1990, which the legislation we introduce today would \nreauthorize, were to reduce the incidence of child abuse, and mandate \nthe reporting and tracking of child abuse in Indian Country.\n  The Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act \nAmendments would provide additional safeguards for the privacy of \ninformation about a child; provide more involvement by the FBI and the \nAttorney General in documenting incidents of child abuse; direct a \nstudy to identify impediments to the reduction of child abuse in Indian \nCountry, as well as require data collection and annual reporting to \nCongress on child abuse in Indian Country; and authorize the Indian \nHealth Service to use telemedicine in connection with examinations of \nabused Indian children.\n  I particularly appreciate that this reauthorization legislation \naddresses a related issue about which I have deep concern--the epidemic \nof youth suicide in many reservation communities. Indian Country has \nhigher rates of youth suicide, as well as of child abuse, than other \nAmerican population groups. Often, children who attempt suicide have \nbeen abused by a family or community member. This bill would authorize \nprofessionals trained in behavioral health, including suicide \nprevention and treatment, to be included on the staff of regional \nIndian Child Resource and Family Services Centers.\n  Chairman McCain and I are committed to providing these additional \nprotections for Native American children. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport passage of this reauthorization bill, along with adoption of \nprovisions for child abuse prevention and child protective services \nthat are contained in legislation also under consideration to \nreauthorize the Indian Health Care Improvement Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mr. Brownback, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n        Santorum, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 1902. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize \nfunding for the establishment of a program on children and the media \nwithin the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to study the role \nand impact of electronic media in the development of children; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with \nSenators Brownback, Clinton, Santorum, and Durbin, the Children and \nMedia Research Advancement Act, or CAMRA Act. This bill is essentially \nidentical to S. 579, which we introduced earlier this year, except that \nit houses our program within the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) \nrather than in the National Institute of Child Health and Human \nDevelopment. We have reviewed the programs and activities within CDC \nthat address issues relating to media's impact on children, and we \nbelieve that CDC is a logical home for our legislation.\n  There is an urgent need to establish a Federal role for targeting \nresearch on the impact of media on children. From the cradle to the \ngrave, our children now live and develop in a world of media--a world \nthat is increasingly digital, and a world where access is at their \nfingertips. This emerging digital world is well known to our children, \nbut its effects on their development are not well understood. Young \npeople today are spending an average of 6 and a half hours with media \neach day. For those who are under age 6, two hours of exposure to \nscreen media each day is common, even for those who are under age two. \nThat is about as much time as children under age 6 spend playing \noutdoors, and it is much more time than they spend reading or being \nread to by their parents. How does this investment of time affect \nchildren's physical development, their cognitive development, or their \nmoral values? Unfortunately, we still have very limited information \nabout how media, particularly the newer interactive media, affect \nchildren's development. In fact, we have not charged any Federal agency \nwith ensuring an ongoing funding base to establish a coherent research \nagenda about the impact of media on children's lives. This lack of a \ncoordinated government-sponsored effort to understand the effects of \nmedia on children's development is truly an oversight on our part as \nthe potential payoffs for this kind of knowledge are enormous.\n  Consider our current national health crisis of childhood obesity. The \nnumber of U.S. children and teenagers who are overweight has more than \ntripled from the 1960's through 2002. We think that media exposure is \npartly the cause of this epidemic. Is it? Is time spent viewing screens \nand its accompanying sedentary life styles contributing to childhood \nand adolescent obesity? Or is the\n\n[[Page S11670]]\n\nconstant bombardment of advertisements for sugar-coated cereals, snack \nfoods, and candy that pervade children's television advertisements the \nculprit? How do the newer online forms of ``stealth marketing'', such \nas advergaming where food products are embedded in computer games, \naffect children's and adolescents' purchasing patterns? What will \nhappen when pop-up advertisements begin to appear on children's cell \nphones that specifically target them for the junk food that they like \nbest at a place where that food is easily obtainable? The answer to the \nobesity and media question is complex. A committee at the National \nAcademy of Sciences is currently charged with studying the link between \nmedia advertising and childhood obesity. Will the National Academy of \nSciences panel have the data they need to answer this important \nquestion? A definitive answer has the potential to save a considerable \namount of money in other areas of our budget. For example, child health \ncare costs that are linked to childhood obesity issues could be reduced \nby understanding and altering media diets.\n  Or take the Columbine incident. After two adolescent boys shot and \nkilled some of their teachers, classmates, and then turned their guns \non themselves at Columbine High School, we asked ourselves if media \nplayed some role in this tragedy. Did these boys learn to kill in part \nfrom playing first-person shooter video games like Doom where they \nacted as a killer? Were they rehearsing criminal activities when \nplaying this game? We looked to the research community for an answer. \nIn the violence and media area, Congress had passed legislation in the \npast so that research was conducted about the relationship between \nmedia violence and childhood aggression, and as a result, we knew more. \nEven though much of this data base was older and involved the link \nbetween exposure to violent television programs and childhood \naggression, some answers were forthcoming about how the Columbine \ntragedy could have taken place. Even so, there is still a considerable \namount of speculation about the more complex questions. Why did these \nparticular boys, for example, pull the trigger in real life while \nothers who played Doom confine their aggressive acts to the gaming \ncontext? We need to be able to answer questions about which children \nunder what circumstances will translate game playing into real-life \nlethal actions. Investing in media research could potentially reduce \nour budgets associated with adolescent crime and delinquency as well as \nreduce real-life human misery and suffering.\n  Many of us believe that our children are becoming increasingly \nmaterialistic. Does exposure to commercial advertising and the ``good \nlife'' experienced by media characters partly explain materialistic \nattitudes? We're not sure. Recent research using brain-mapping \ntechniques finds that an adult who sees images of desired products \ndemonstrates patterns of brain activation that are typically associated \nwith reaching out with a hand. How does repeatedly seeing attractive \nproducts affect our children and their developing brains? What will \nhappen when our children will be able to click on their television \nscreen and go directly to sites that advertise the products that they \nsee in their favorite programs? Or use their cell phones to pay for \nproducts that they want in the immediate environment? Exactly what kind \nof values are we cultivating in our children, and what role does \nexposure to media content play in the development of those values?\n  A report linked very early television viewing with later symptoms \nthat are common in children who have attention deficit disorders. \nHowever, we don't know the direction of the relationship. Does \ntelevision viewing cause attention deficits, or do children who have \nattention deficits find television viewing experiences more engaging \nthan children who don't have attention problems? Or do parents whose \nchildren have difficulty sustaining attention let them watch more \ntelevision to encourage more sitting and less hyperactive behavior? How \nwill Internet experiences, particularly those where children move \nrapidly across different windows, influence attention patterns and \nattention problems? Once again, we don't know the answer. If early \ntelevision exposure does disrupt the development of children's \nattention patterns, resulting in their placement in special education \nprograms, actions taken to reduce screen exposure during the early \nyears could lead to subsequent reductions in children's need for \nspecial education classes, thereby saving money while fostering \nchildren's development in positive ways.\n  We want no child left behind in the 21st century. Many of us believe \nthat time spent with computers s good for our children, teaching them \nthe skills that they will need for success in the 21st century. Are we \nright? How is time spent with computers different from time spent with \ntelevision? What are the underlying mechanisms that facilitate or \ndisrupt children's learning from these varying media? Can academic \ndevelopment be fostered by the use interactive online programs designed \nto teach as they entertain? In the first six years of life, Caucasian \nmore so than African American or Latino children have Internet access \nfrom their homes. Can our newer interactive media help ensure that no \nchild is left behind or will disparities in access result in leaving \nsome behind and not others?\n  The questions bout how media affect the development of our children \nare clearly important, abundant, and complex. Unfortunately, the \nanswers to these questions are in short supply. Such gaps in our \nknowledge base limit our ability to make informed decisions about media \npolicy.\n  We know that media are important. Over the years, we have held \nnumerous hearings in these chambers about how exposure to media \nviolence affects childhood aggression. We passed legislation to \nmaximize the documented benefits of exposure to educational media, such \nas the Children's Television Act which requires broadcasters to provide \neducational and informational television programs for children. Can we \nfoster children's moral values when they are exposed to prosocial \nprograms that foster helping, sharing, and cooperating like those that \nhave come into being as a result of the Children's Television Act? We \nacted to protect our children from unfair commercial practices by \npassing the Children Online Privacy Protection Act which provides \nsafeguards from exploitation for our youth as they explore the \nInternet, a popular pastime for them. Yet the Internet has provided new \nways to reach children with marketing that we barely know is taking \nplace, making our ability to protect our children all the more \ndifficult. We worry about our children's inadvertent exposure to online \npornography--about how that kind of exposure may undermine their moral \nvalues and standards of decency. In these halls of Congress, we acted \nto protect our children by passing the Communications Decency Act, the \nChild Online Protection Act, and the Children's Internet Protection Act \nto shield children from exposure to sexually-explicit online content \nthat is deemed harmful to minors. While we all agree that we need to \nprotect our children from online pornography, we know very little about \nhow to address even the most practical of questions such as how to \nprevent children from falling prey to adult strangers who approach them \nonline. There are so many areas in which our understanding is \npreliminary at best, particularly in those areas that involve the \neffects of our newer digital media\n  In order to ensure that we are doing our very best for our children, \nthe behavioral and health recommendations and public policy decisions \nwe make should be based on objective behavioral, social, and scientific \nresearch. Yet no Federal research agency has responsibility for \noveseeing and setting a coherent media research agenda that can guide \nthese policy decisions. Instead, federal agencies fund media research \nin a piecemeal fashion, resulting in a patch work quilt of findings. We \ncan do better than that.\n\n  The bill we are introducing today would remedy this problem. The \nCAMRA Act will provide an overarching view of media effects by \nestablishing a program devoted to Children and Media within the Centers \nfor Disease Control. This program of research, to be vetted by the \nNational Academy of Sciences, will fund and energize a coherent program \nof research that illuminates the role of media in children's cognitive, \nsocial, emotional, physical,\n\n[[Page S11671]]\n\nand behavioral development. The research will cover all forms of \nelectronic media, including television, movies, DVDs, interactive video \ngames, cell phones, and the Internet, and will encourage research \ninvolving children of all ages--even babies and toddlers. The bill also \ncalls for a report to Congress about the effectiveness of this research \nprogram in filling this void in our knowledge base. In order to \naccomplish these goals, we are authorizing $90 million dollars to be \nphased in gradually across the next five years. The cost to our budget \nis minimal and can well result in significant savings in other budget \nareas.\n  Our Nation values the positive, healthy development of our children. \nOur children live in the information age, and our country has one of \nthe most powerful and sophisticated information technology systems in \nthe world. While this system entertains them, it is not harmless \nentertainment. Media have the potential to facilitate the healthy \ngrowth of our children. They also have the potential to harm. We have a \nstake in finding out exactly what that role is. We have a \nresponsibility to take action. Access to the knowledge that we need for \ninformed decision-making requires us to make an investment: an \ninvestment in research, an investment in and for our children, an \ninvestment in our collective future. The benefits to our youth and our \nnation's families are immeasurable.\n  By passing the Children and Media Research Advancement Act, we can \nadvance knowledge and enhance the constructive effects of media while \nminimizing the negative ones. We can make future media policies that \nare grounded in a solid knowledge base. We can be proactive, rather \nthan reactive. In so doing, we build a better nation for our youth, \nfostering the kinds of values that are the backbone of this great \nnation of ours, and we create a better foundation to guide future media \npolicies about the digital experiences that pervade our children's \ndaily lives.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1902\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Children and Media Research \n     Advancement Act'' or the ``CAMRA Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Congress has recognized the important role of \n     electronic media in children's lives when it passed the \n     Children's Television Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-437) and \n     the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-104), both \n     of which documented public concerns about how electronic \n     media products influence children's development.\n       (2) Congress has held hearings over the past several \n     decades to examine the impact of specific types of media \n     products such as violent television, movies, and video games \n     on children's and adolescents' health and development. These \n     hearings and other public discussions about the role of media \n     in children's and adolescents' development require behavioral \n     and social science research to inform the policy \n     deliberations.\n       (3) There are important gaps in our knowledge about the \n     role of electronic media and in particular, the newer \n     interactive digital media, in children's and adolescents' \n     healthy development. The consequences of very early screen \n     usage by babies and toddlers on children's cognitive growth \n     are not yet understood, nor has a research base been \n     established on the psychological consequences of high \n     definition interactive media and other format differences for \n     child and adolescent viewers.\n       (4) Studies have shown that children who primarily watch \n     educational shows on television during their preschool years \n     are significantly more successful in school 10 years later \n     even when critical contributors to the child's environment \n     are factored in, including their household income, parent's \n     education, and intelligence.\n       (5) The early stages of childhood are a critical formative \n     period for development. Virtually every aspect of human \n     development is affected by the environments and experiences \n     that one encounters during his or her early childhood years, \n     and media exposure is an increasing part of every child's \n     social and physical environment.\n       (6) As of the late 1990's, just before the National \n     Institute of Child Health and Human Development funded 5 \n     studies on the role of sexual messages in the media on \n     children's and adolescents' sexual attitudes and sexual \n     practices, a review of research in this area found only 15 \n     studies ever conducted in the United States on this topic, \n     even during a time of growing concerns about HIV infection.\n       (7) In 2001, a National Academy of Sciences study group \n     charged with studying Internet pornography exposure on youth \n     found virtually no literature about how much children and \n     adolescents were exposed to Internet pornography or how such \n     content impacts their development.\n       (8) In order to develop strategies that maximize the \n     positive and minimize the negative effects of each medium on \n     children's physical, cognitive, social, and emotional \n     development, it would be beneficial to develop a research \n     program that can track the media habits of young children and \n     their families over time using valid and reliable research \n     methods.\n       (9) Research about the impact of the media on children and \n     adolescents is not presently supported through one primary \n     programmatic effort. The responsibility for directing the \n     research is distributed across disparate agencies in an \n     uncoordinated fashion, or is overlooked entirely. The lack of \n     any centralized organization for research minimizes the value \n     of the knowledge produced by individual studies. A more \n     productive approach for generating valuable findings about \n     the impact of the media on children and adolescents would be \n     to establish a single, well-coordinated research effort with \n     primary responsibility for directing the research agenda.\n       (10) Due to the paucity of research about electronic media, \n     educators and others interested in implementing electronic \n     media literacy initiatives do not have the evidence needed to \n     design, implement, or assess the value of these efforts.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to enable the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to--\n       (1) examine the role and impact of electronic media in \n     children's and adolescents' cognitive, social, emotional, \n     physical, and behavioral development; and\n       (2) provide for a report to Congress containing the \n     empirical evidence and other results produced by the research \n     funded through grants under this Act.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 282\n\n       Whereas 2005 marks the 11th anniversary of the enactment of \n     the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-322, \n     108 Stat. 1902);\n       Whereas since the passage of the Violence Against Women Act \n     of 1994, communities have made significant progress in \n     reducing domestic violence such that between 1993 and 2001, \n     the incidents of nonfatal domestic violence fell 49 percent;\n       Whereas the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 cost $15.50 \n     per woman to implement, and has been estimated to save $159 \n     per woman, totaling a savings of nearly $14,800,000,000 since \n     its creation in averted costs of victimization;\n       Whereas since it was created by the Violence Against Women \n     Act of 1994, the National Domestic Violence Hotline has been \n     used to answer over 1,000,000 calls;\n       Whereas States have passed over 660 State laws pertaining \n     to domestic violence, stalking, and sexual assault;\n       Whereas the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 has helped \n     make strides toward breaking the cycle of violence, but there \n     remains much work to be done;\n       Whereas the Senate recently passed the Violence Against \n     Women Act of 2005 which reauthorized critical components of \n     the original Act and established additional protections for \n     battered immigrants and victims of human trafficking in order \n     to further combat domestic violence and sexual assault;\n       Whereas domestic violence affects women, men, and children \n     of all racial, social, religious, ethnic, and economic groups \n     in the United States;\n       Whereas protecting the economic security of victims can \n     help break the cycle of domestic violence;\n       Whereas abusers frequently seek to control their partners \n     by actively interfering with the ability of their partners to \n     work, including by preventing their partners from going to \n     work and harassing their partners at work;\n       Whereas only 28 States and the District of Columbia have \n     laws that explicitly provide unemployment insurance to \n     victims of domestic violence under certain circumstances;\n       Whereas, on average, more than 3 women are murdered by \n     their husbands or boyfriends in the United States every day;\n       Whereas women who have been abused are much more likely to \n     suffer from chronic pain, diabetes, depression, unintended \n     pregnancies, substance abuse, and sexually transmitted \n     infections, including HIV/AIDS;\n       Whereas only about 10 percent of primary care physicians \n     routinely screen for domestic violence during new patient \n     visits, and 9 percent routinely screen during periodic \n     checkups;\n       Whereas each year, about 324,000 pregnant women in the \n     United States are battered by the men in their lives, leading \n     to pregnancy complications, such as low-weight gain, anemia, \n     infections, and first and second trimester bleeding;\n       Whereas every 2 minutes, someone in the United States is \n     sexually assaulted;\n       Whereas almost 25 percent of women surveyed had been raped \n     or physically assaulted by a spouse or boyfriend at some \n     point in their lives;\n       Whereas in 2002 alone, 250,000 women and girls older than \n     the age of 12 were raped or sexually assaulted;\n       Whereas 64 percent of women have reported being raped, \n     physically assaulted, or stalked since age 18 by their \n     current or former intimate partner;\n       Whereas 1 out of every 12 women has been stalked in her \n     lifetime;\n       Whereas approximately 503,000 women are stalked by an \n     intimate partner annually in the United States;\n       Whereas the influence of cultural norms, economics, \n     language barriers, and limited access to legal services and \n     information may render some immigrant women particularly \n     vulnerable to abuse;\n       Whereas 1 in 5 adolescent girls in the United States \n     becomes a victim of physical or sexual abuse, or both, in a \n     dating relationship;\n       Whereas 40 percent of girls ages 14 to 17 report knowing \n     someone their age who has been hit or beaten by a boyfriend;\n       Whereas approximately 8,800,000 children in the United \n     States witness domestic violence each year;\n       Whereas witnessing domestic violence increases the risk of \n     developing long-term physical and mental health problems, \n     future struggles with substance abuse, and experiencing \n     domestic abuse as a victim;\n       Whereas a boy who witnesses his father's domestic violence \n     is 10 times more likely to engage in domestic violence than a \n     boy from a nonviolent home;\n       Whereas almost 37 percent of all women who sought care in \n     hospital emergency rooms for violence-related injuries were \n     injured by a current or former spouse, boyfriend, or \n     girlfriend;\n       Whereas the cost of domestic violence, including rape, \n     physical assault, and stalking, exceeds $5,800,000,000 each \n     year, of which $4,100,000,000 is spent on direct medical and \n     mental health care services;\n       Whereas 44 percent of the mayors of the United States have \n     identified domestic violence as a primary cause of \n     homelessness;\n       Whereas over 50 percent of abused women lose at least 3 \n     days of work per month due to domestic violence, 60 percent \n     of battered women endure reprimands for arriving late to work \n     and displaying other work-related problems associated with \n     abuse, and 70 percent report difficulties in performing their \n     work due to the effects of domestic violence;\n       Whereas existing statistical data suggests that forced \n     prostitution, trafficking for sex, and sex tourism has \n     increased throughout the world;\n       Whereas the need to increase the public awareness and \n     understanding of domestic violence and the needs of battered \n     women and their children continues to exist;\n\n[[Page S11673]]\n\n       Whereas the month of October 2005 has been recognized as \n     National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, a month for \n     activities furthering awareness of domestic violence; and\n       Whereas the dedication and successes of those working \n     tirelessly to end domestic violence and the strength of the \n     survivors of domestic violence should be recognized: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Domestic \n     Violence Awareness Month; and\n       (2) expresses the sense of the Senate that Congress should \n     continue to raise awareness of domestic violence in the \n     United States and its devastating impact

Res. 283\n\n       Whereas on January 13, 1903, the arrival of 102 pioneer \n     immigrants to the United States initiated the first chapter \n     of Korean immigration to the United States;\n       Whereas members of the early Korean American community \n     served with distinction in the Armed Forces of the United \n     States during World War I, World War II, and the conflict in \n     Korea;\n       Whereas in the early 1950s, thousands of Koreans, fleeing \n     from war, poverty, and desolation, came to the United States \n     seeking opportunities;\n       Whereas Korean Americans, like waves of immigrants to the \n     United States before them, have taken root and thrived as a \n     result of strong family ties, robust community support, and \n     countless hours of hard work;\n       Whereas the contributions of Korean Americans to the United \n     States include the invention of the first beating heart \n     operation for coronary artery heart disease, development of \n     the nectarine, a 4-time Olympic gold medalist, and \n     achievements in engineering, architecture, medicine, acting, \n     singing, sculpture, and writing;\n       Whereas Korean Americans play a crucial role in maintaining \n     the strength and vitality of the United States-Korean \n     partnership;\n       Whereas the centennial year of 2003 marked an important \n     milestone in the now more than 100-year history of Korean \n     immigration; and\n       Whereas the Centennial Committees of Korean Immigration and \n     Korean Americans have designated January 13th of each year as \n     ``Korean American Day'' to memorialize the more than 100-year \n     journey of Korean Americans in the United States: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of a ``Korean American \n     Day'';\n       (2) commemorates the 103rd anniversary of the arrival of \n     the first Korean immigrants to the United States; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to--\n       (A) share in such commemoration in order to greater \n     appreciate the valuable contributions Korean Americans have \n     made to the United States; and\n       (B) to observe ``Korean American Day'' with appropriate \n     programs, ceremonies, and activities.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Allen as an \noriginal cosponsor in submitting a resolution recognizing the \ncontributions of Korean Americans and encouraging the celebration of \n``Korean American Day.''\n  On January 13, 1903, a group of 102 men, women and children arrived \non the shores of Honolulu, HI, after a long journey across the Pacific \nOcean from Korea. The story of these pioneers is a familiar one to all \nof us who trace our roots to a foreign nation.\n  Like countless other immigrant groups before them, Koreans came to \nAmerica in search of a better future. Others came to flee a devastating \nwar, repressive government, and poverty. They traded in their sweat \nequity and homesickness for the priceless opportunity to achieve better \neconomic and educational opportunities and freedom for themselves and \nfor their families in America.\n  During the past century, the Korean American population has grown to \nover one million, and Korean Americans now live in every single State \nof our union. Today, they represent one of the largest Asian American \npopulations in the Nation. I am proud to note that my State of Illinois \nis home to over 50,000 Korean Americans, making it the fourth most \npopulated State for Korean Americans, according to the 2000 census \ndata.\n  The contributions made by Korean Americans to our Nation include \nnumerous achievements in the fields of economics, education, science, \narchitecture, medicine, athletics, religion, and the arts. Their \nentrepreneurial spirit and dedication to hard work have allowed Korean \nAmerican-owned businesses to become the commercial and economic \nfoundations in countless American cities and counties. The unique \ntraditional customs, cultures, and the foods of the ``Land of the \nMorning Calm'' have enhanced the mosaic of our society.\n  Thousands of Korean Americans have served in our Armed Services, from \nthe two World Wars to the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. They \nhave also served in public and private ways to enhance the long \nstanding relationship between the United States and Korea that is based \non our shared economic and security interests.\n  The 102 pioneers who made that fateful decision to leave their home \ncountry in 1902 for Hawaii probably wished for not much more than a \nchance to live on the rich American soil. Never in their wildest \nimagination could they have known that, a century later, and just a few \nmiles from where they landed in Honolulu, a sixteen-year-old Korean \nAmerican girl would announce to an eagerly awaiting world that she \nwould become a professional golfer.\n  Michelle Wie's announcement from earlier this month instantly places \nher among the most recognizable American celebrities, and makes her the \nthird highest-paid female athlete in any sport, based on commercial \nendorsement deals she has accepted. Yet, in her very first act as a \nprofessional golfer, Michelle donated $500,000 to the hurricane relief \neffort. And, she will continue to attend high school where she is an \nhonors student.\n  Korean Americans have indeed come a long way in their rich one \nhundred year history. In January 2003, Korean Americans all across the \nNation celebrated this centennial anniversary. Leading up to that \nsignificant milestone, the United States Senate unanimously adopted a \nresolution during the 107th Congress.\n  To continue recognizing this history of Korean Americans, I believe \nit is appropriate to celebrate the 13th day of each January as ``Korean \nAmerican Day.'' The Allen-Durbin resolution would encourage such a \ntradition.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this resolution honoring the \ncontinuing contributions of Korean Americans to our great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/20/senate-section/article/S11673-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11673-S11674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2149.

The bill provides relief for \ndisplaced students in a time of crisis, without opening political or \nideological battles.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. ENZI. Of course.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend our Chairman, Senator Enzi, for \nhis leadership throughout this process. The hearings and meetings he \nconvened to enable us to hear directly from the persons most affected \nby the devastation of Hurricane Katrina have been invaluable to the \ndevelopment of this bipartisan legislation.\n  I also commend Senator Alexander and Senator Dodd for their \nleadership in working with us to draft this one-time, temporary impact \naid for displaced students attending public and nonpublic schools. We \nall agree that all displaced students deserve help in continuing their \neducation, and we all agree on the extraordinary circumstances and \nunprecedented scope of this disaster.\n  The aid provided by this bill flows through the public school system \nto ensure greater accountability for the money. It enables these \nschools to make payments to accounts set up for displaced students in \nnonpublic schools, as well, which can then use those funds to provide \nservices to the displaced students enrolled in their schools.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Wi11 the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Certainly.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I would also like to thank my \ncolleagues for working together to craft this temporary emergency \nprogram to provide one-time assistance to all displaced school children \nin public and nonpublic schools. I am also pleased that we were able to \ndevelop this legislation in a way that provides financial assistance \nfor all displaced school children without getting into ideological \nbattles.\n  Mr. DODD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Of course.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I cannot underscore enough what my \ncolleagues have already stated--that this is a one-time, emergency aid \nprogram. All of the authors of the bill have agreed that next school \nyear, in terms of assistance to nonpublic schools, we will go back to \nthe way things are done today. We are reaching out to all of the \nstudents affected by Katrina here, no matter what type of school they \nattend, because it makes sense under these extraordinary conditions, \nbecause it gets kids back on their feet as quickly as possible. In no \nway is this bill meant to undermine or amend current law or set any \ntype of precedent for future legislation.\n  Mr. ENZI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. Of course.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I would just like to echo the sentiments of \nthe senior Senator from Connecticut. We have all agreed and have \nexplicitly stated in the bill, that the level and type of assistance we \nare providing to both public and nonpublic schools is being authorized \nsolely because of the unprecedented nature of the crisis, the massive \ndislocation of students, and the short duration of the assistance.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Will the Senator yield?\n\n[[Page S11697]]\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Certainly.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, as you know, Hurricane Katrina had a \ndevastating and unprecedented impact on students and schools not only \nin the disaster areas, but across the country. There are over 45,000 \ndisplaced students enrolled in Texas schools and over 3,900 enrolled in \nschools in my home State of Tennessee. This is an unprecedented \nsituation, and it requires an appropriate response for students in \npublic and nonpublic schools. But that response must be a temporary, \none-time only program to address the particular needs of this \nsituation, and that is what this bill accomplishes. It is not intended \nto set a precedent for anything except another disaster in which over \n370,000 school children are displaced. Katrina did not discriminate \namong schoolchildren, and neither should we.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Of course.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I agree with the sentiments of my \ncolleagues and want to point out that we have clearly stated in the \nbill our intentions with regard to the temporary nature of this \nprogram. Would the Senator from Tennessee please explain the provisions \nwe have included to ensure that the program is not extended?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Certainly. The bill creates one-time only emergency \naid for the 2005-2006 school year. The bill explicitly states that the \nfunds provided can only be used for expenses incurred during the \ncurrent school year, and the entire bill sunsets on August 1, 2006.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator from Tennessee. Would the Senator \nyield for a follow-up question?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Isn't it true that in addition to these provisions in \nthe bill, we have all agreed to stand together against attempts to \nextend this program beyond this school year or beyond this context?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Yes, that is true.\n  Mr. ENZI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Yes.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, as my colleagues and I have made clear, we \nhave come together in a spirit of bipartisan compromise to accomplish a \ncommon goal. This bill will provide the relief necessary to support the \ninstruction and services that students displaced by this terrible storm \nneed in order to continue their education, regardless of whether it was \na public school or a nonpublic school that opened its doors to a given \nstudent. Mr. President, we hope that our colleagues in the Senate will \nwork quickly with us to pass this bill and put these to work providing \nan education to our children as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, today I join my colleagues Senators Alexander, Kennedy \nand Dodd in the introduction of the Hurricane Katrina Elementary and \nSecondary Education Recovery Act.\n  This bill is a comprehensive legislative approach to address the \nneeds of the hundreds of thousands of students who have been displaced \nby Hurricane Katrina. We have developed a bill that includes strategies \nto meet the immediate needs of those students, families and communities \nthat have been affected by the heavy toll that Hurricane Katrina \nexacted from the gulf region, and the States that have responded with \nhelp.\n  My top concern was to make sure that all the displaced students get \nback into school so that they can continue their education. Returning \nto school gives children a sense of routine that is important in \nassuring them that things will return to normal. School provides them \nwith access to a support system of friends and teachers, which is \ninvaluable as they and their families continue to come to grips with \nthe aftereffects of the storm.\n  With this bill we have attempted to address the needs that have been \nidentified by the impacted communities directly affected by the storm \nas well as by those communities across the country that received the \ndisplaced students. The bill provides support for all displaced \nstudents, ensures accountability, and is fiscally responsible.\n  In addition to the support for displaced students in both public and \nnon-public schools, the bill includes provisions for supplemental \nservices, restart services for schools in the most heavily impacted \nstates, teacher and paraprofessional reciprocity, and assistance for \nhomeless youth and displaced adolescent students. This bill is a \nbipartisan product that reflects what we heard from over 100 \nrepresentatives of the education community and what we saw firsthand in \nthe areas devastated by the storm.\n  This is a daunting task as we have limited resources, but are faced \nwith an almost unlimited need. We must focus our efforts on ensuring \nthat the educational needs of the children affected by this \nunprecedented emergency are addressed. I believe that this legislation \nachieves that goal.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we need to address the urgent school \nneeds of the hundreds of thousands of children affected by the deadly \nstorm that hit the gulf coast, and the bill that Senator Alexander, \nSenator Dodd, Chairman Enzi and I have introduced will begin to do so.\n  As we continue to see images of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita \nand the troubled process of rebuilding along the gulf coast, we are \nreminded that we are all part of the American family, and we have a \nresponsibility to help members of that family when they are in need.\n  Part of that responsibility is to do all we can to see that children \nand youth do not lose a year of their education. Hundreds of thousands \nof school children attended classes in buildings that have been damaged \nor destroyed. In Mississippi, 271 schools have been damaged; and in \nLouisiana over 130,000 students have been affected. Hurricane Katrina \nalone displaced 372,000 children, and damaged or destroyed 700 schools. \nOur legislation will provide urgently needed resources to help these \nschools get back on track and help these displaced students to resume \ntheir education, wherever they've temporarily landed.\n  People across the country have opened their homes. Communities have \nopened their schools. We owe a great debt of gratitude to all the \nprincipals and superintendents who stepped up to the plate so quickly.\n  But they need realistic help from Congress as they struggle to \naccommodate these students. We need to do all we can to assist already \nhard-pressed schools as they attempt to meet the massive new challenge \nof including hundreds or thousands of new students in their local \nschools.\n  This bill will provide the relief necessary to support the \ninstruction, after-school programs, and other school services the \nstudents need, when everything in their lives has been turned upside-\ndown. It provides needed funding to help schools on the gulf coast to \nreopen soon, so that these children can return to their own schools as \nquickly as possible.\n  The bill provides $900 million for special school reopening grants \nfor affected districts. These grants will supplement FEMA funding to \nassure effective use of Federal funds. They can be used to re-purchase \ntextbooks and instructional materials, establish temporary facilities \nwhile repairs are being made, help reestablish the data that was \ndestroyed, and pay the salaries of teachers and other personnel who are \nworking to reopen these schools.\n  The bill also provides $2.4 billion to help ease the temporary \ntransition of students into new school districts and relieve the \nfinancial burden on these schools through one-time emergency impact aid \nfor receiving districts. Districts will report the number of affected \npublic and private school students they have enrolled, including \nstudents with special needs, and receive supplemental aid in quarterly \npayments, for a maximum of $6,000 a pupil, or $7,500 a pupil for those \nwith disabilities.\n  These funds will be used to help the districts cover the additional \ncosts they have incurred as a result of enrolling displaced students, \nand can be used for purposes such as supporting basic instruction, \npurchasing educational materials and supplies, and helping schools \ntemporarily expand facilities to avoid overcrowding.\n\n  Given the extraordinary circumstances and unprecedented scope of this \ndisaster, we need to support the families whose lives have been \ndestroyed by this storm by helping them to continue their children's \neducation. We should do so even if their children ended up in a private \nschool. But we must do so in a way that is non-ideological and \nresponsible.\n\n[[Page S11698]]\n\n  Our bill is a bipartisan compromise to support children who enrolled \nin the private schools that opened their doors to students displaced by \nKatrina. Through this temporary, one-time emergency impact aid, funds \nwill go to public school districts, which will make payments on behalf \nof dislocated children enrolled in private schools in their area.\n  Under current law, Federal funding is available in certain \ncircumstances to support the education of disadvantaged and disabled \nstudents in private schools. Our bill follows that model, which will \nexpedite relief to affected families and provide accountability for \npublic funds.\n  The aid provided by the bill flows through the public school system, \nnot to parents. States must establish income eligibility criteria for \naid to students enrolled in private schools. Under the bill, the public \nschool makes payments to an account set up for displaced students in a \nprivate school. The private schools can then access those funds to \nprovide services on behalf of the displaced students enrolled in their \nschools.\n  Our bill contains strong civil rights protections. Schools that \nparticipate in the program are not allowed to discriminate in \nenrollment on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability, or \nsex. The bill explicitly states that existing civil rights laws apply \nto recipients of these funds, and it prohibit Federal funds from being \nused for religious purposes.\n  The bill explicitly states that this type and level of aid to public \nand private schools is being provided only because of the unprecedented \ncircumstances and massive dislocation of students caused by the \nhurricanes. As sponsors of the bill, we agree that this will be a \ntemporary program, and that it is not intended to be a precedent for \nanything except another disaster in which over 370,000 school children \nare displaced.\n  The bill sunsets at the end of the school year, and funds provided \ncan be used only for expenses incurred during the 2005-2006 school \nyear.\n  The bill also includes $100 million for after-school programs and \nsupplemental services for displaced children, and $50 million to help \nchildren who are newly homeless as a result of the hurricane.\n  In addition, the bill creates a new one-year authority for a program \nfor high school juniors and seniors. Grants will go to state and local \neducation agencies alone, or in partnership with colleges and \ncommunity-based organizations, to offer alternative programs that \nprovide instruction, test preparation and assistance with college \napplications, and job readiness skills.\n  Our bill will relieve the immediate and short term needs of these \nschools and children. But we may need to do more to help the \ncommunities along the gulf coast rebuild. We must ensure that schools \nand communities have adequate resources to meet their construction \nneeds, and we must ensure that communities are able to bring their \nquality teachers and workforce back home. As the process of rebuilding \nmoves forward, we will continue to look for ways the Federal Government \ncan help make these communities better than ever.\n  Our bill is a bipartisan, compromise that will give relief to schools \nand children as soon as possible. I urge Congress and the \nadministration to enact this legislation as soon as possible, so that \nthese funds can do their job. The children and schools affected by the \nhurricanes cannot wait any longer.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, Hurricane Katrina displaced more than 1 \nmillion people, at least 20 times more than in any other disaster \nhandled by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and 372,000 of \nthose displaced by Katrina are school-aged children, in kindergarten \nthrough the 12th grade. According to the U.S. Department of Education, \nschools in 49 States and the District of Columbia have opened their \ndoors to help these children.\n  The legislation that Senators Enzi, Kennedy, Dodd and I introduce \ntoday will help all of Katrina's 372,000 displaced school children. \nKatrina did not discriminate among school children, and neither do we. \nWe propose providing up to $6,000 per student during this school year \nto help States, school districts and schools defray the costs of \nreceiving any child displaced by Katrina. In the case of children with \ndisabilities, the maximum amount will be $7,500 per student. This \nlegislation will help children attending both public and nonpublic \nschools. Our bill is temporary, one time impact aid, makes no permanent \nchange Federal education laws and will not be extended after this \nschool year. It minimizes costs by making payments quarterly, taking \ninto account the fact that during the year many children are returning \nto their home communities.\n  It also requires the Secretary of Education to verify head counts of \nstudents eligible for aid, and the States must return to the U.S. \nTreasury any unused funds. States, as part of their application \nprocess, will be able to look at the income of families attending \nnonpublic schools when determining what aid should be available, \nalthough it is my strong hope that in doing this, the States will \nremember that almost any displaced family is suffering hardship and \nthat burdensome means testing requirements could slow down much needed \nhumanitarian help.\n  Nine States have received more than a thousand of these displaced \nstudents, with the largest number being in Louisiana and Mississippi, \nthe two States most heavily damaged by Katrina. In addition, Texas has \nenrolled as many as 60,000 students. Houston Independent School \nDistrict, which has enrolled roughly 4,700 displaced students, has \nhired 180 new teachers, added 37 new bus routes and ordered about \n10,000 new textbooks to accommodate the students. Georgia has accepted \nmore than 9,000 students, Alabama almost 5,400 students, and my home \nState of Tennessee has enrolled almost 4,000 students.\n  While most of these children are in public schools, private schools \nhave also been essential to this humanitarian effort. This should not \nsurprise us because in the four Louisiana parishes hit the hardest by \nKatrina nearly one third or 61,000 of the 187,000 students attended \nnonpublic schools. According to the Department of Education, \nimmediately after the hurricane, 50,000 students from the Catholic \nArchdiocese of Greater New Orleans were displaced. In Texas 4,000 of \nthe 60,000 displaced students enrolled in private schools. In \nTennessee, about 3,500 were in public schools and 500 in nonpublic \nschools.\n  In Baton Rouge according to a report on National Public Radio, \nimmediately after the hurricane there were suddenly 5,000 to 10,000 \ndisplaced private school students who had no school to attend. To \naccommodate them, the Catholic Diocese in Baton Rouge struggled to \nestablish satellite schools--some located great distances away--which \nthese students attended at night.\n  In Memphis, where so many displaced students have gone, the \nwillingness of private schools to accept these students is an enormous \nhelp to overcrowded public schools. The Memphis City schools have \nenrolled over 650 students and the adjacent Shelby County Public School \nDistrict has enrolled over 600 new children, a difficult burden in a \nschool system already growing by 1,000 students and one new school \nbuilding each year. The Memphis Catholic Diocese has enrolled over 250 \nstudents to help share the load.\n  During the last 6 weeks, some of these children are returning home as \nschools reopen. But severe problems of displacement remain. For \nexample, school officials in Baton Rouge and Livingston, LA, expect to \nreceive a new influx of children moving to shelters in Houston and \nother locations. The schools in the three hardest hit parishes--\nOrleans, St. Bernard and Plaquemines--enrolled 81,196 public and 27,886 \nprivate and religious school students. Many of these schools are \nexpected to remain closed for the entire school year.\n  In additional to helping all of Katrina's displaced school children, \nin fashioning this proposal we have sought to respect traditional State \nand local education prerogatives, to meet Federal constitutional \nrequirements, to make the provisions simple enough that this aid could \nbe administered quickly, and to avoid spending more taxpayer dollars \nthan absolutely necessary.\n\n  This is how our proposal would work. To begin with, a State would \nsubmit to the U.S. Department of Education an\n\n[[Page S11699]]\n\napplication identifying the number of Katrina displaced students \nattending public schools, Bureau of Indian Affairs--BIA--schools, and \nnonpublic schools in that State. The application will also describe the \nprocess for establishing and providing payments to student accounts for \ndisplaced students at nonpublic schools. After receiving Federal \ndollars, States would in turn make payments to school districts based \nupon the number of displaced students temporarily enrolled in public \nschools or nonpublic schools in that district. These payments would be \nup to $6,000 annually for each displaced student, except that for \nstudents receiving IDEA services the total payment would be as much as \n$7,500.\n  In the case of students enrolled in nonpublic schools, school \ndistricts would make payments to student accounts on behalf of each \nsuch displaced student. The amount of the payment to each of these \nstudent accounts would be the same as that for each student enrolled at \na public school unless the tuition, fees, or transportation expenses \nfor the nonpublic student are less than $6,000, or $7,500 in the case \nof a student receiving IDEA services.\n  This has not been an easy piece of legislation to write because the \nfour of us do not agree on whether or how Federal dollars should follow \nchildren to private schools, including religious schools. But we do \nagree that there must be a one-time, temporary solution to help all of \nKatrina's displaced children. Therefore, we have found a way to create \nthis one-time temporary impact aid that makes no permanent change in \nFederal education law and, insofar as we are concerned establishes no \nprecedent--except perhaps for some other hurricane that displaces \n372,000 children.\n  In other words, we have set aside disputing our ideological \ndifferences for another day and hope that our colleagues will do the \nsame. We have done this in the spirit suggested by a Washington Post \neditorial last month which appeared shortly after the hurricane:\n\n       Just as it's important not to sneak in an enormous new \n     federal program for ideological reasons, it's also important \n     that neither Democrats, teachers unions nor anyone else rule \n     out for ideological reasons what could be a useful tool for \n     distributing relief funds. There could be pragmatic reasons \n     to put displaced students in private or parochial schools: \n     if, say, school districts are overcrowded, if students have \n     special needs or if that happens to be where they ended up. \n     So it might make sense to attach a sum to each student--\n     whether it's called a voucher or something else--as long as \n     that sum is given out in a limited number of places and for a \n     limited time, certainly not longer than the current school \n     year.\n       . . . any solution that would allow students to finish the \n     year with a minimum of fuss and disruption to themselves and \n     their families, and that would prevent school districts in \n     Texas and elsewhere from unduly burdened, should be welcomed.\n\n  If each of us maintains our traditional positions, there would be no \nway to help all of Katrina's displaced children. There was nothing \ntraditional about what happened in Hurricane Katrina. We urgently need \nto help all children on a one-time, emergency basis.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I support the Hurricane Katrina Elementary \nand Secondary Education Recovery Act introduced by myself, Senator \nEnzi, Senator Kennedy and Senator Alexander. This bill will provide \nmuch needed relief to the children, families and schools devastated by \nHurricane Katrina.\n  Hundreds of thousand of children have been displaced by this \ndisaster. Schools across the country are taking students in offering \nthem some sense of normalcy in an otherwise abnormal situation. We have \nheard stories of schools all over the country that have opened their \ndoors to new students, including schools in Connecticut. These \ncollective examples point to our education system as an integral part \nof our communities. Better than any other entity, schools know that \nchildren need a safe place to develop and learn in the wake of \ndisaster.\n  Among the provisions today, is one that will provide financial \nassistance for displaced students regardless of where they go to \nschool. Public and nonpublic schools will receive assistance that can \nbe used to pay for additional personnel, curricular materials, portable \nclassrooms and even health and mental health services as long as the \nservices provided are secular and neutral in nature and are not used \nfor religious instruction, indoctrination or worship.\n  This is not a voucher bill. Through a number of mechanisms, this bill \nmaintains public control of public dollars. This bill prohibits Federal \ndollars from going to religious instruction. And, this bill preserves \ncivil rights protections.\n  Most important, this bill is temporary in nature. The bill provides \ntemporary emergency impact aid for displaced students. It is temporary \nin that it sunsets at the end of the current school year, emergency in \nthat it is necessary because of the extraordinary circumstances that we \nhave been presented with, and impact aid as it is assistance for those \nschools that have been impacted as thousands of children and their \nfamilies have left the devastated areas.\n  I cannot underscore this enongh--the provisions in this bill are a \ndeparture from Federal law but they are a temporary departure in light \nof extraordinary events. Next school year, in terms of assistance to \nnonpublic schools, we will go back to the ways things are. We are \nreaching out to all students here, today, because it makes sense, \nbecause it gets kids back on their feet as quickly as possible. We are \nnot changing the generic laws. As we explicitly state in the bill, the \nlevel of assistance we are providing to nonpublic schools is being \nauthorized solely because of the unprecedented nature of the crisis, \nthe massive dislocation of students, and the short duration of the \nassistance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/20/senate-section/article/S11699-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               FOREIGN SERVICE GRIEVANCE BOARD PROCEDURES\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Res. 260\n\n       Whereas the Republic of Azerbaijan is scheduled to hold \n     elections for its parliament, the Milli Majlis, in November \n     2005;\n       Whereas Azerbaijan has enjoyed a strong relationship with \n     the United States since its independence from the former \n     Soviet Union in 1991;\n       Whereas international observers monitoring Azerbaijan's \n     October 2003 presidential election found that the pre-\n     election, election day, and post-election environments fell \n     short of international standards;\n       Whereas the International Election Observation Mission \n     (IEOM) in Baku, Azerbaijan, deployed by the Organization for \n     Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of \n     Europe, found that there were numerous instances of violence \n     by both members of the opposition and government forces;\n       Whereas the international election observers also found \n     inequality and irregularities in campaign and election \n     conditions, including intimidation against opposition \n     supporters, restrictions on political rallies by opposition \n     candidates, and voting fraud;\n       Whereas Azerbaijan freely accepted a series of commitments \n     on democracy, human rights, and the rule of law when that \n     country joined the OSCE as a participating State in 1992;\n       Whereas, following the 2003 presidential election, the \n     Council of Europe adopted Resolution 1358 (2004) demanding \n     that the Government of Azerbaijan immediately implement a \n     series of steps that included the release of political \n     prisoners, investigation of election fraud, and the creation \n     of public service television to allow all political parties \n     to better communicate with the people of Azerbaijan;\n       Whereas, since the 2003 presidential election, the \n     Government of Azerbaijan has taken some positive steps by \n     releasing some political prisoners and working to create \n     public service television;\n       Whereas the United States supports the promotion of \n     democracy and transparent, free, and fair elections \n     consistent with the commitments of Azerbaijan as a \n     participating State of the OSCE;\n       Whereas the United States is working with the Government of \n     Azerbaijan, the political opposition, civil society, the \n     OSCE, the Council of Europe, and other countries to \n     strengthen the electoral process of Azerbaijan through \n     diplomatic efforts and non-partisan assistance programs, \n     including support for international and domestic election \n     observers, voter education and election information \n     initiatives, training for candidates and political parties, \n     and training for judges and lawyers on the adjudication of \n     election disputes;\n       Whereas the Government of the United States has awarded a \n     contract to conduct exit polling throughout Azerbaijan;\n       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires that \n     citizens be guaranteed the right and opportunity to exercise \n     their civil and political rights, free from intimidation, \n     undue influence, threats of political retribution, or other \n     forms of coercion by national or local authorities or others;\n       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires \n     government and public authorities to ensure that candidates \n     and political parties enjoy equal treatment before the law \n     and that government resources are not employed to the \n     advantage of individual candidates or political parties; and\n       Whereas the establishment of a transparent, free and fair \n     election process for the 2005 parliamentary elections is an \n     important step in Azerbaijan's progress toward full \n     integration into the democratic community of nations: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) calls on the Government of the Republic of Azerbaijan \n     to hold orderly, peaceful, and free and fair parliamentary \n     elections in November 2005 in order to ensure the long-term \n     growth and stability of the country;\n       (2) calls upon the Government of Azerbaijan to guarantee \n     the full participation of opposition parties in the upcoming \n     elections, including members of opposition parties arrested \n     in the months leading up to the November 2005 parliamentary \n     elections;\n       (3) calls upon the opposition parties to fully and \n     peacefully participate in the November 2005 parliamentary \n     elections, and calls upon the Government of Azerbaijan to \n     create the conditions for the participation on equal grounds \n     of all viable candidates;\n       (4) believes it is critical that the November 2005 \n     parliamentary elections be viewed by the people of Azerbaijan \n     as free and fair, and that all sides refrain from violence \n     during the campaign, on election day, and following the \n     election;\n       (5) calls upon the Government of Azerbaijan to guarantee \n     election monitors from the Office for Democratic Institutions \n     and Human Rights of the Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Azeri political parties, \n     representatives of candidates, nongovernmental organizations, \n     and other private institutions and organizations, both \n     foreign and domestic, unimpeded access to all aspects of the \n     election process;\n       (6) supports recommendations made by the Council of Europe \n     on amendments to the Unified Election Code of Azerbaijan, \n     specifically to ensure equitable representation of opposition \n     and pro-government forces in all election commissions;\n       (7) urges the international community and domestic \n     nongovernmental organizations to provide a sufficient number \n     of election observers to ensure credible monitoring and \n     reporting of the November 2005 parliamentary elections;\n       (8) recognizes the need for the establishment of an \n     independent media and assurances by the Government of \n     Azerbaijan that freedom of the press will be guaranteed; and\n       (9) calls upon the Government of Azerbaijan to guarantee \n     freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/20/senate-section/article/S11700-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, OCTOBER 21, 2005\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
