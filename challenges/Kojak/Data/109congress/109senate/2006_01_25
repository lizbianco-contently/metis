Mr. President, will the majority leader yield to me for 1 \nminute while I bring up an issue that we were discussing yesterday?\n\n[[Page S36]]\n\n  Mr. FRIST Mr. President, I will be happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                            Lobbying Reform\n\n  Mr. McCain. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his \nefforts to move the issue of lobbying reform forward. We had a good \nmeeting yesterday amongst other Members, and Senator Lieberman and I \nand others also, as the majority leader knows, have introduced \nlegislation. There has been input made by other Members, and I know the \nmajority leader joins me in saying we need to put together a bipartisan \ncoalition to address this issue as quickly as possible. We need to sit \ndown with Members of both sides of the aisle in whatever format the \nmajority leader and the Democratic leader decide so we can get to work \nright away and get legislation done to curb the lobbying excesses that \nhave been brought to light that need to be fixed.\n  At another time I would like to talk with the majority leader about \nthe issue of earmarks, but I thank the majority leader for urging rapid \naction on this issue. We do have a basis for negotiation, and I hope we \nwill be able to immediately sit down with Members from the other side \nof the aisle, come to conclusions and agreements--since it is pretty \nobvious the majority of the fixes that need to be made--and move \nforward. I thank the majority leader and the Democratic leader for \nurging rapid action in addressing this issue which is causing us, our \nimage and our reputation to be hurt very badly in the eyes of the \nAmerican people.\n  I thank the majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, just a very short comment. I have been in \ndiscussion with the Democratic leader on this issue as well. As our \ndistinguished colleague from Arizona has just said, we on the \nRepublican side have put together a working group in terms of how to \naddress this very important issue. It has to be done in a bipartisan \nway. America is looking at this body to respond to abuses that we have \nall seen in our Government today. I think we all need to be committed \nto address this in a bipartisan way.\n  We have a great structure to build upon in the legislation that has \nbeen introduced in a bipartisan way with Senators McCain and Lieberman. \nI look forward to working with both sides of the aisle in developing an \nappropriate response over the coming days.\n  Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the time from 10 a.m. \nuntil 8 p.m. tonight be divided, with the time from 10 to 11 under the \ncontrol of the majority leader or his designee, the time from 11 to \nnoon under the control of the Democratic leader or his designee, with \neach hour rotating back and forth in that same manner. I further ask \nunanimous consent that on Thursday this same division occur, with the \nfirst hour from 10 to 11 under the control of the Democratic leader or \nhis designee.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there an objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today, I am honored to open debate on the \nnomination of Judge Sam Alito to be the 110th Associate Justice of the \nSupreme Court of the United States.\n  I enthusiastically support his confirmation.\n  Judge Alito deserves to become Justice Alito. Those who oppose him \nare smearing a decent and honorable man and imposing an unfair \npolitical standard on all judicial nominees.\n  I support Judge Alito because he is exceptionally qualified to be a \nSupreme Court Justice. I support Judge Alito because he is a man of \nintegrity and modest judicial temperament. I support Judge Alito \nbecause he has a record that demonstrates a respect for judicial \nrestraint, an aversion to political agendas on the bench, and a \ncommitment to the rule of law and the Constitution.\n\n  There is no question that Judge Alito is exceptionally well \nqualified. He is measured, brilliant, deeply versed in and respectful \nof the law, and a man of character and integrity. But there is another \nreason I support Judge Alito. I support Judge Alito because denying him \na seat on the Supreme Court could have devastating long-term \nconsequences for our judicial nomination process. Let me address these \nissues one at a time.\n  Exceptional qualifications: From the moment President Bush nominated \nhim last October, Judge Alito's exceptional qualifications had a \n``wow'' factor that impressed Senators of both parties. In every \nrespect, Judge Alito is a nominee who meets the highest standards of \nexcellence.\n  He is a graduate of Princeton and Yale Law School. He has dedicated \nhis 30-year legal career to public service as a Federal prosecutor and \nassistant to the Solicitor General, where he argued 12 cases before the \nSupreme Court, and for the last 15 years as a Federal judge on the \nThird Circuit in New Jersey. He has been unanimously confirmed by this \nbody not once but twice. On the Federal bench, he has participated in \nmore than 3,500 cases and has written more than 300 opinions. The \nAmerican Bar Association gave Judge Alito its highest rating, \nunanimously ``well qualified.'' He is a man of integrity and modest \njudicial temperament.\n  Exceptional qualifications only begin to reveal why Sam Alito should \nbe confirmed to the Supreme Court. Throughout his career as a \nprosecutor and a judge, Sam Alito earned a reputation as a man of \nintegrity who was fairminded and evenhanded. He earned the trust and \nrespect of his colleagues, Republicans, Democrats, and Independents. \nThat is one reason seven Federal judges endorsed his nomination and \ntestified on his behalf.\n  Through the Judiciary Committee hearings, we saw a clear picture \nemerge of Judge Alito's modest judicial temperament. Despite enduring \nrelentless questioning of his credibility, integrity, and personal and \npolitical views, Judge Alito remained unflappable, never once raising \nhis voice or becoming confrontational, focusing clearly and \narticulately on the facts, the law, and the constitutional questions \npresented to him. He understands the limited role of a judge--judicial \nrestraint, impartiality, and a commitment to the rule of law.\n  In addition to all of his exceptional qualifications, integrity, and \ntemperament, Judge Alito deserves confirmation because he understands \nthe limited role of a judge to interpret the law and not legislate from \nthe bench. He practices judicial restraint and refuses to prejudge \ncases or apply a personal political agenda on the bench. In his hearing \nbefore the Judiciary Committee, this philosophy was clear. He said:\n\n       A judge can't have an agenda. A judge can't have any \n     preferred outcome in any particular case. . . . The judge's \n     only obligation--and it's a solemn obligation--is to the rule \n     of law, and what that means is that in every single case, the \n     judge has to do what the law requires.\n\n  In his 15 years on the bench, Judge Alito has done exactly that. Just \nlisten to the words of one of Judge Alito's former law clerks, a \nregistered Democrat who, by the way, still has a ``Kerry for \nPresident'' bumper sticker on his car. His words:\n\n       Until I read [Judge Alito's] 1985 Reagan job application, I \n     could not tell you what his politics were . . . When we \n     worked on cases, we reached the same result about 95 percent \n     of the time . . . It was my experience that Judge Alito was \n     (and is) capable of setting aside any personal biases he may \n     have when he judges. He is the consummate professional.\n\n  Long-term consequences for the judicial nominations process: Perhaps \nthe most important reason to support Judge Alito has less to do with \nJudge Alito himself and more to do with our judicial nominations \nprocess. Regardless of their political views, Senators should treat \njudicial nominees with dignity, respect, and fairness, not just because \nit is the right thing to do but because a process that politicizes and \ndegrades judicial nominees will drive our very best and our brightest \naway from the bench. I am profoundly disappointed in the unfair and \nunseemly treatment of Judge Alito during this process. His judicial \nrecord has been distorted and mischaracterized. He has been labeled as \nnonresponsive during his hearings, despite providing candid and \narticulate answers to more than 650 questions and over 18 hours of \ntestimony--far more than many, perhaps any Supreme Court nominee in the \npast--and most sadly, he has been the victim of a calculated but \nunsuccessful campaign to smear his character, his integrity, and his \ncredibility.\n  In an editorial in support of Judge Alito, published on January 15, \nthe\n\n[[Page S37]]\n\nWashington Post expressed this concern, even though they would have \nchosen a different nominee than Judge Alito:\n\n       He would not have been our pick for the high court. Yet \n     Judge Alito should be confirmed, both because of his positive \n     qualities as an appellate judge and because of the dangerous \n     precedent his rejection would set . . . Supreme Court \n     confirmations have never been free of politics, but neither \n     has their history generally been one of party-line votes or \n     of ideology as the determinative factor. To go down that road \n     is to believe that there exists a Democratic law and a \n     Republican law--which is repugnant to the ideal of the rule \n     of law. However one reasonably defines ``mainstream'' of \n     contemporary jurisprudence, Judge Alito's work lies within \n     it. While we harbor some anxiety about the direction he may \n     push the court, we would be more alarmed at the long-term \n     implications of denying him a seat. No President should be \n     denied the prerogative of putting a person as qualified as \n     Judge Alito on the Supreme Court.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the Washington Post \neditorial of January 15 entitled ``Confirm Samuel Alito on the Supreme \nCourt'' be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. FRIST. Thirteen years ago, a Republican minority in the Senate \nvoted to confirm the qualified nominee of a Democratic President by an \noverwhelming vote of 96 to 3. Despite a well-documented liberal record, \nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg sits on the Supreme Court today because \nRepublican Senators chose to focus on her qualifications and not to \nobstruct her nomination based merely on her judicial philosophy or \nideology. I urge my colleagues to vote to confirm Judge Alito by \napplying that same fair standard. As we debate this week, I hope we can \nput aside partisan rhetoric and the politics of personal destruction \nand stand on principle. Qualified judicial nominees such as Judge Alito \ndeserve respectful debate and a fair up-or-down vote on the Senate \nfloor. As Senators, it is our fundamental constitutional duty and \nresponsibility.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 15, 2006]\n\n                          Confirm Samuel Alito\n\n       The Senate's decision concerning the confirmation of Samuel \n     A. Alito Jr. is harder than the case last year of now-Chief \n     Justice John G. Roberts Jr. Judge Alito's record raises \n     concerns across a range of areas. His replacement of Justice \n     Sandra Day O'Connor could alter--for the worse, from our \n     point of view--the Supreme Court's delicate balance in \n     important areas of constitutional law. He would not have been \n     our pick for the high court. Yet Judge Alito should be \n     confirmed, both because of his positive qualities as an \n     appellate judge and because of the dangerous precedent his \n     rejection would set.\n       Though some attacks on him by Democratic senators and \n     liberal interest groups have misrepresented his \n     jurisprudence, Judge Alito's record is troubling in areas. \n     His generally laudable tendency to defer to elected \n     representatives at the state and federal levels sometimes \n     goes too far--giving rise to concerns that he will prove too \n     tolerant of claims of executive power in the war on terror. \n     He has tended at times to read civil rights statutes and \n     precedents too narrowly. He has shown excessive tolerance for \n     aggressive police and prosecutorial tactics. There is reason \n     to worry that he would curtail abortion rights. And his \n     approach to the balance of power between the federal \n     government and the states, while murky, seems unpromising. \n     Judge Alito's record is complicated, and one can therefore \n     argue against imputing to him any of these tendencies. Yet he \n     is undeniably a conservative whose presence on the Supreme \n     Court is likely to produce more conservative results than we \n     would like to see.\n       Which is, of course, just what President Bush promised \n     concerning his judicial appointments. A Supreme Court \n     nomination isn't a forum to refight a presidential election. \n     The president's choice is due deference--the same deference \n     that Democratic senators would expect a Republican Senate to \n     accord the well-qualified nominee of a Democratic president.\n       And Judge Alito is superbly qualified. His record on the \n     bench is that of a thoughtful conservative, not a raging \n     ideologue. He pays careful attention to the record and \n     doesn't reach for the political outcomes he desires. His \n     colleagues of all stripes speak highly of him. His integrity, \n     notwithstanding efforts to smear him, remains unimpeached.\n       Humility is called for when predicting how a Supreme Court \n     nominee will vote on key issues, or even what those issues \n     will be, given how people and issues evolve. But it's fair to \n     guess that Judge Alito will favor a judiciary that exercises \n     restraint and does not substitute its judgment for that of \n     the political branches in areas of their competence. That's \n     not all bad. The Supreme Court sports a great range of \n     ideological diversity but less disagreement about the scope \n     of proper judicial power. The institutional self-discipline \n     and modesty that both Judge Alito and Chief Justice Roberts \n     profess could do the court good if taken seriously and \n     applied apolitically.\n       Supreme Court confirmations have never been free of \n     politics, but neither has their history generally been one of \n     party-line votes or of ideology as the determinative factor. \n     To go down that road is to believe that there exists a \n     Democratic law and a Republican law--which is repugnant to \n     the ideal to the rule of law. However one reasonably defines \n     the ``mainstream'' of contemporary jurisprudence, Judge \n     Alito's work lies within it. While we harbor some anxiety \n     about the direction he may push the court, we would be more \n     alarmed at the long-term implications of denying him a seat. \n     No president should be denied the prerogative of putting a \n     person as qualified as Judge Alito on the Supreme Court.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      Judiciary Commmittee Agenda\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, before proceeding to the nomination of \nJudge Alito to the Supreme Court of the United States, I think it \nworthwhile to comment very briefly on some of the scheduling items for \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  As we all know, the PATRIOT Act was extended from December 31 until \nFebruary 3. I circulated a letter today among our colleagues, and I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. It outlines the alternatives which we face at the \npresent time. One is to let the act expire on February 3, which I think \nno one would like. Second would be to extend the current bill for a \nperiod of time. We will be discussing a 4-year extension. Or, third, to \nhave cloture imposed on the filibuster which is in effect and then vote \nto utilize the conference report and pass the act. It is always \npossible to take another course of action if there is unanimous \nconsent.\n  The conference is technically discharged at this point, and the House \nof Representatives has made it emphatically clear that they have gone \nas far as they think it reasonable to go on the compromises.\n  There have been very substantial compromises worked out. At one \njuncture, there were three additional requests which we took to the \nHouse and got all of them, the most important of which was the sunset \nprovision changed from 7 years to 4 years. Then additional changes were \nrequested, and they could not be accommodated.\n  That is where we stand at the present time. I know there are \ndiscussions underway to try to get some additional changes made. My own \nview is those prospects are somewhere between bleak and nonexistent.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield on that point for a \nmoment?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Certainly.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the distinguished senior Senator from \nPennsylvania has worked as hard on this issue as anybody here. As the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer knows, the original PATRIOT Act was \nwritten by myself, the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, and \nothers. It was the distinguished Republican leader from Texas, Dick \nArmey, and I who put in the sunset provisions so we would be forced to \ncome back and look at different parts of it. Much of the PATRIOT Act is \npermanent law, but we should look at certain parts. Those are the parts \nthat are now most in contention because they will expire.\n  The distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania and I were at the White \nHouse on another matter recently and talked briefly about this with the \nPresident. I know the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. \nSununu, has been working very hard with us. I think the changes that \nstill need to be made are relatively minor. I urge parties, especially \nall of us who helped write the original PATRIOT\n\n[[Page S38]]\n\nAct, to make that one last effort. That would include, of course, the \nWhite House and the other body to do it.\n  The chairman of the Judiciary Committee has worked extraordinarily \nhard on this legislation. I, like so many others, am willing to \ncontinue to work with him. I think with a little nudge from the White \nHouse--that nudge may have to be a quiet one among the principals in \nboth bodies--that can be done. I commend the Senator from New Hampshire \nfor the work he is doing on this issue.\n  I thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee for yielding, even \nthough it is on his time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for his \ncomments. I thank him for the hard work he has done in the past year on \nthe Judiciary Committee on many matters, including the PATRIOT Act. I \nthink we have set a tone and have been able to agree on almost all \nmatters. If there can be some modifications made, agreeable on all \nsides, before February 3, I would be more than willing to be a party to \nthat.\n  My preference is the bill which passed the Senate, but we have a \nbicameral system, and the House has its own point of view, and I think \nthey have been reasonable. We have a good bill, certainly a bill in the \nconference report which is vastly improved with respect to civil rights \nover the current bill. But I am not in favor of having short-term \nextensions. If we have another short-term extension, it will beget \nanother short-term extension. I want to fish or cut bait before \nFebruary 3 on that issue.\n  The Judiciary Committee, on the second item, is scheduled to hold a \nhearing on the wartime Executive power and NSA's surveillance authority \non February 6. I think my colleagues will be interested in a letter \nwhich I have written to the Attorney General dated January 24, \nyesterday, outlining a series of some 15 questions to be addressed in \nadvance of the hearing or at the time of the Attorney General's opening \nstatement--at least that request--to try to set the parameters and \nissues of that hearing. I ask unanimous consent that the letter to \nAttorney General Gonzalez be printed in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy statement today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. A third item of Judiciary Committee scheduling involves \nthe asbestos reform bill. The leader has stated his intention to bring \nit up on February 6. As we customarily do, we meet in the afternoon. I \nintend to absent myself from the Judiciary Committee hearing on NSA to \ncome make an opening statement. Then we will proceed on that bill.\n  Senator Leahy and I sent a letter yesterday to our colleagues asking \nthat, if there are amendments to be offered, and I am sure there will \nbe, that they be provided to the managers in advance so we can organize \nproceeding on the bill and seek time agreements. That has been a very \ndifficult and contentious issue, but it was passed out of the committee \nlast year after numerous executive sessions marking up the bill and \nextended debate on a variety of amendments. Many were accepted, some \nwere rejected.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States has called upon Congress to \naddress this issue. It does not lend itself to a solution in the courts \non class actions. There are thousands of people who are suffering from \nthe injuries of asbestos--mesothelioma, which is deadly, and \nasbestosis, and others--who cannot recover because their employers are \nbankrupt. Over 75 companies have gone bankrupt, and more are threatened \nwith bankruptcy.\n  The bill which we have reported to the floor is the product of \nenormous effort and enormous analysis by the Judiciary Committee and \nbeyond. It was voted out of committee 13 to 5. Senator Leahy and I have \nconvened meetings, along with the assistance of Judge Becker, a senior \nFederal judge--he had been Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals for the \nThird Circuit--where we have brought in the so-called stakeholders: the \ninsurers, the trial lawyers, the AFL/CIO, and the manufacturers. They \nworked through that bill which has festered in the Congress for more \nthan two decades. I first saw it when Gary Hart, then-Senator from \nColorado, brought in Johns Manville, which was a key constituent of \nhis, which was having a problem. I believe it is clear that if we are \nnot able to act now, it will be decades before this kind of an effort \ncan be mustered again.\n  I have one additional comment on the scope of the work. After it was \npassed out of committee in late July of 2003, I asked Judge Becker to \nassist as a mediator. We had meetings in his chambers in Philadelphia--\ntwo full days in August. We have had about 50 meetings since, attended \nby sometimes more than 40 or 50 people.\n  We are still open for business to consider modifications. We know the \nlegislative process is one where, when it comes to the floor, there are \namendments. There are more ideas. But this is an issue which is of \ntremendous urgency. The President has spoken about it. The President \nwants it enacted. The majority leader is firmly behind legislation by \nthe Senate. The Speaker of the House of Representatives has spoken \nabout it. But candidly and openly, we face very powerful interests who \nare opposed to any action.\n  There are very substantial dollars involved. There is very \nsubstantial pain and suffering involved. Those of us who have worked on \nthe bill--led by the distinguished Senator from Vermont and myself and \nothers--have gone to the well and gone to the wall. We still are open \nfor business and invite comments. But anybody who has amendments, we \nwould like to hear from you as early as possible so we can consider \nthem, try to work out time agreements, and try to move the bill ahead \nin a managers' context.\n\n  I am glad to yield to Senator Leahy.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, again I agree with what the distinguished \nSenator from Pennsylvania has said. This is a bipartisan bill. In fact, \nto emphasize it, he and I have sent a letter to all of our colleagues, \nsigned jointly, asking them, if they have amendments which they plan to \noffer, to let us know.\n  It should be emphasized that not only did we have hours upon hours of \nhearings, but we had many open meetings in the office of the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, in my office, and the offices of others. We made \nsure that the stakeholders, all the stakeholders were able to come to \nthose meetings. We also made sure that the office of every Senator--\neverybody who expressed any interest, Republican or Democrat--was \ninvited to those meetings. They were wide open. In fact, almost all of \nthe Senators on both sides of the aisle either attended those meetings \nor had staff attend those meetings.\n  At these meetings that we had, again, every single stakeholder was \ninvolved. It was open. It was bipartisan. That was made clear by the \nSenator from Pennsylvania from the beginning, that they would have to \nbe open and bipartisan. He, as would be expected, kept his commitment \nall the way through.\n  I would highlight two things the Senator from Pennsylvania just said \nthat were of concern to me. One, if we do not do it now, we lose the \nopportunity. I believe it will be decades before anybody would put \ntogether the kind of coalition that it has been possible to put \ntogether. The other thing he said was that it is not just some of the \npowerful financial stakes involved, but it is a powerful amount of \nsuffering that is going on by the people who are suffering from \nasbestos poisoning in all the different forms. They are the ones who \nare held in limbo throughout all this time. We can bring some relief to \nthem now; not the possibility of relief 10 years from now after a \nseries of lawsuits go through, but now.\n  We have had members of the Supreme Court, ranging from the late Chief \nJustice William Rehnquist to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg--certainly two \ndiffering philosophies--who have called upon the Congress to bring \nabout a legislative solution because our courts are unable to handle \nall the cases that might come up. Let's be clear about that. There are \nsome who say we are litigating forever on this, but the fact is our \ncourts are unable to handle it. It cries out for a legislative \nsolution.\n  I urge people to come to this with an open mind, vote it up or down, \nvote the amendments up or down. I have heard some opponents quoted as \nbeing prepared to demagog this bipartisan bill. This bill did not just \nsuddenly spring\n\n[[Page S39]]\n\nout of nowhere; it was worked on in such a way that it is a bipartisan \nbill. And I might say there is pain in it for everybody. Everybody has \nhad to give something in this. The Senator from Pennsylvania did not \nget everything he wanted. I did not get everything I wanted. The \nstakeholders who came to the table, virtually all of them openly and \nhonestly, they gave up a lot on it. But the people who are suffering \nfrom asbestos poisoning in whatever form are the ones waiting for us to \nact.\n  The time is right to act. We can pass a bipartisan bill. I believe \nthe other body would be glad to see such a bill. The President has \nstated publicly and he certainly stated privately to both Senator \nSpecter and myself that he is behind taking action. Everybody cries out \nfor some bipartisan action around here. This is one of those cases \nwhere Republicans and Democrats could come together, where the Congress \nand the White House could work together, and actually those who benefit \nwill be the people suffering. We ought to get on with it.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 25, 2006.\n       Dear Colleague: The Patriot Act is due to expire on \n     February 3, 2006 after being extended from its prior \n     expiration date of December 31, 2005.\n       The Senate is faced with three options:\n       1. Invoke cloture on the Conference Report and pass the \n     Conference Report as the House of Representatives has already \n     done;\n       2. Extend the present Act for a period of time. The current \n     discussion with the House is to extend it for four years; or\n       3. Let the Act expire.\n       To my knowledge, no one wants to let the Act expire.\n       Technically, the House/Senate Conference has been \n     discharged with the filing of the Conference Report. While it \n     is always possible to take another course of action such as \n     changing the Conference Report if there is unanimous \n     agreement, the House has taken the emphatic position that \n     there will be no more concessions from the Conference Report \n     and the House is very firm in this position.\n       Everyone, including those who are urging further House \n     concessions, agrees that the Conference Report is much more \n     protective of civil rights than the current Patriot Act. I am \n     enclosing a side-by-side comparison. While I would have \n     preferred the Senate bill, we do have a Bicameral System and \n     the Conference Report was hammered out after extensive \n     negotiations with significant concessions by the House. \n     Senate proponents for further House concessions had, at one \n     point, stated their willingness to sign the Conference Report \n     if three conditions were met including a change in the sunset \n     date from seven to four years. Those conditions were met and \n     then there was insistence on further concessions.\n       I urge the Senate to invoke cloture and pass the Conference \n     Report as the best of the available alternatives.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                        Side-by-Side Comparison\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      Conference report (2006)          Current law (PATRIOT Act 2001)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Requests for Business Records (``Library Provision'') Section 215\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nApplication to the FISA Court for    No requirement of any factual\n an order under Section 215           showing.\n requires a statement of facts.\nRecords can be obtained only if the  Records can be obtained if the FBI\n FISA Judge finds that the            merely ``specif[ies] that . . .\n statement of facts shows             they are sought for an authorized\n ``reasonable grounds to believe      investigation.''\n that the tangible things sought\n are relevant to an authorized\n investigation''.\nMay not be used for threat           May be used for threat assessments.\n assessments.\nEncourages the FBI to demonstrate a  No analogous incentive for the FBI\n connection to terrorism or           to demonstrate a connection to\n espionage by providing a             terrorism or espionage.\n presumption of relevance if the\n records sought pertain to: (a) a\n foreign power or an agent of a\n foreign power; (b) the activities\n of a suspected agent of a foreign\n power who is the subject of the\n investigation; or (c) an\n individual in contact with, or\n known to, a suspected agent of a\n foreign power who is the subject\n of the investigation.\nRequires the use of minimization     No requirement that minimization\n procedures that will limit ``the     procedures be used.\n retention, and prohibit the\n dissemination'' of information\n concerning U.S. persons.\nExplicit right of recipients of      No explicit right of recipients of\n Section 215 requests to consult      Section 215 requests to consult\n legal counsel.                       legal counsel.\nExplicit right of recipients of      No explicit right of recipients of\n Section 215 requests to challenge    Section 215 requests to challenge\n their legality in court.             their legality in court.\nRequirement that the FBI Director,   No special requirements for\n Deputy Directer, or Executive        sensitive documents such as\n Assistant Director personally        library records.\n approve requests for certain\n sensitive documents, including\n library records, medical records,\n educational records, and gun\n records.\nLimits the scope of Section 215      No specified limitation on the\n requests to materials that could     scope of Section 215 requests.\n be obtained via grand jury\n subpoena or a similar court order\n for the production of records.\nAdds the Senate Judiciary Committee  ``Fully inform[ed]'' reports given\n as a recipient of the ``fully        only to House and Senate\n inform[ed]'' reports.

Alberto R. Gonzales,\n     Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Attorney General Gonzales: I write to let you know \n     some of the subjects which I would like you to address in \n     your opening statement on the Judiciary Committee hearing \n     scheduled for February 6, 2006, on ``Wartime Executive Power \n     and the NSA's Surveillance Authority.''\n       (1) In interpreting whether Congress intended to amend the \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) by the September \n     14, 2001 Resolution (Resolution), would it be relevant on the \n     issue of Congressional intent that the Administration did not \n     specifically ask for an expansion for Executive powers under \n     FISA? Was it because you thought you couldn't get such an \n     expansion as when you said: ``That was not something that we \n     could likely get?''\n       (2) If Congress had intended to amend FISA by the \n     Resolution, wouldn't Congress have specifically acted to as \n     Congress did in passing the Patriot Act giving the Executive \n     expanded powers and greater flexibility in using ``roving'' \n     wiretaps?\n       (3) In interpreting statutory construction on whether \n     Congress intended to amend FISA by the Resolution, what is \n     the impact of the rule of statutory construction that repeals \n     or changes by implication are disfavored?\n       (4) In interpreting statutory construction on whether \n     Congress intended to amend FISA by the Resolution, what would \n     be the impact of the rule of statutory construction that \n     specific statutory language, like that in FISA, trumps or \n     takes precedence over more general pronouncements like those \n     of the Resolution?\n       (5) Why did the Executive not ask for the authority to \n     conduct electronic surveillance when Congress passed the \n     Patriot Act and was predisposed, to the maximum extent \n     likely, to grant the Executive additional powers which the \n     Executive thought necessary?\n       (6) Wasn't President Carter's signature on FISA in 1978, \n     together with his signing statement, an explicit renunciation \n     of any claim to inherent Executive authority under Article II \n     of the Constitution to conduct warrantless domestic \n     surveillance when the Act provided the exclusive procedures \n     for such surveillance?\n       (7) Why didn't the President seek a warrant from the \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court authorizing in \n     advance the electronic surveillance in issue? (The FISA Court \n     has the experience and authority to issue such a warrant. The \n     FISA Court has a record establishing its reliability for non-\n     disclosure or leaking contrasted with concerns that \n     disclosures to many members of Congress involved a high risk \n     of disclosure or leaking. The FISA Court is a least as \n     reliable, if not more so, that the Executive Branch on \n     avoiding disclosure or leaks.)\n       (8) Why did the Executive Branch not seek after-the-fact \n     authorization from the FISA Court within the 72 hours as \n     provided by the Act? At a minimum, shouldn't the Executive \n     have sought authorization from the FISA Court for law \n     enforcement individuals to listen to a reduced number of \n     conversations which were selected out from a large number of \n     conversations from the mechanical surveillance?\n       (9) Was consideration given to the dichotomy between \n     conversations by mechanical surveillance from conservations \n     listened to by law enforcement personnel with the contention \n     that the former was non-invasive and only the latter was \n     invasive? Would this distinction have made it practical to \n     obtain Court approval before the conservations were subject \n     to human surveillance or after-the-fact approval within 72 \n     hours.\n       (10) Would you consider seeking approval from the FISA \n     Court at this time for the ongoing surveillance program at \n     issue?\n       (11) How can the Executive justify disclosure to only the \n     so-called ``Gang of Eight'' instead of the full intelligence \n     committees when Title V of the National Security Act of 1947 \n     provides:\n       Sec. 501. [50 U.S.C. 413] (a)(1) The President shall ensure \n     that the congressional intelligence committees are kept fully \n     and currently informed of the intelligence activities of the \n     United States, including any significant anticipated \n     intelligence activity as required by this title. (Emphasis \n     added)\n       (2)(e) Nothing in this Act shall be construed as authority \n     to withhold information from the congressional intelligence \n     committees on the grounds that providing the information to \n     the congressional intelligence committees would constitute \n     the unauthorized disclosure of classified information or \n     information relating to intelligence sources and methods. \n     (Emphasis added)\n       (12) To the extent that it can be disclosed in a public \n     hearing (or to be provided in a closed executive session), \n     what are the facts upon which the Executive relies to assert \n     Article II wartime authority over Congress' Article I \n     authority to establish public policy on these issues \n     especially where legislation is approved by the President as \n     contrasted to being enacted over a Presidential veto as was \n     the case with the War Powers Act?\n       (13) What case law does the Executive rely upon in \n     asserting Article II powers to conduct the electronic \n     surveillance at issue?\n       (14) What academic or export opinions does the Executive \n     rely upon in asserting Article II powers to conduct the \n     electronic surveillance at issue?\n       (15) When foreign calls (whether between the caller and the \n     recipient both being on foreign soil or one of the callers or \n     recipients being on foreign soil and the other in the U.S.) \n     were routed through switches which were physically located on \n     U.S. soil, would that constitute a violation of law or \n     regulation restricting NSA from conducting surveillance \n     inside the United States, absent a claim of \n     unconstitutionality on encroaching on Executive powers under \n     Article II?\n       This letter will further confirm our staffs' discussions \n     that the Committee will require, at a minimum, the full day \n     on February 6th for your testimony.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague for \nthose comments.\n  There is no doubt about the suffering of those who are afflicted with \nmesothelioma and asbestosis and other ailments. There is also no doubt \nabout the tremendous impact it has on the economy of the United States. \nIt has been estimated that there could be a bigger boost than any kind \nof tax cuts you could have or any sort of economic recovery program you \ncould have to be able to deal with the more than 75 companies that have \ngone into bankruptcy and others where bankruptcy is threatened.\n  The amount of work that the Senator from Vermont has specified has \nbeen gigantic. It has been 3 years in process. Senator Hatch took the \nlead with the trust fund concept where the manufacturers and the \ninsurers have agreed to put up some $140 billion into the trust fund \nwith no government payments and not coming out of the pockets of the \ntaxpayers.\n  The meetings which have been held and the efforts and the momentum \nwhich we have had can't be recaptured. I think it is fair to say, \ncertainly during my tenure here of 25 years, that I have never seen \nlegislation worked on to the extent this legislation has been, with the \ncomplexity of the problem and the involvement of Senators and staff and \nso-called stakeholders. If it is not now, it is never.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I support the nomination by President \nBush of Circuit Court Judge Samuel A. Alito, Jr., to the Supreme Court \nof the United States because he is qualified.\n  In coming to my conclusion, my staff and I have undertaken an \nextensive review of Judge Alito's record and of his some 361 opinions \nin total. We have categorized 238 of those as major decisions while \nserving on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. We have reviewed 49 of \nthe cases that Judge Alito handled during his tenure as U.S. attorney. \nWe have made an analysis of 43 speeches and articles Judge Alito \nauthorized and evaluations of 38 formal opinions, petitions, and \nSupreme Court briefs which Judge Alito wrote while serving in the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  Additionally, the Judiciary Committee heard testimony of some 30 \nhours and 20 minutes where we had 17 hours and 45 minutes of \nquestioning of Judge Alito and testimony from 33 outside witnesses.\n  It is on the basis of that voluminous record that it is my personal \nview that Judge Alito ought to be confirmed.\n  He has a background from a father who was an immigrant from Italy, \nnot\n\n[[Page S41]]\n\nborn with a silver spoon in his mouth, came up the hard way, had the \nextraordinary academic record at Princeton and the Yale Law School, \nworked as an Assistant U.S. Attorney, then was U.S. Attorney and worked \nin the Department of Justice, and for 15 years has been on the Court of \nAppeals for the Third Circuit.\n  I think he answered questions put to him more extensively than any \nother nominee in recent times.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the prepared statement \nbe printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks, which \nspecifies the details of the questions asked and provides analysis of \nmany of his cases.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1).\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, Judge Alito came under very extensive \nquestioning on the issue of a woman's right to choose because of his \nwork on a brief on the Thornburgh case where he advocated not reversal \nof Roe v. Wade but cut back on some of the provisions, and because of a \nstatement which he had made in 1985 when applying for a position with \nthe Federal Government where he expressed the view that the \nConstitution did not protect the right to an abortion. Judge Alito \ntestified at length that he has an open mind on this subject.\n  I think it is fair to say that when a comment is made by a lawyer in \nan advocacy capacity that it represents the view of a client on a \nposition taken and not a personal view. With respect to the statement \nthat he made about his view of the Constitution in 1985, he has since \ngone to great lengths to analyze the Supreme Court's decisions on the \nissue of a woman's right to choose and has made assurances that he has \nan open mind on the subject.\n  He was questioned extensively on this issue. I led off with it for 20 \nminutes on my first round of questioning. And Judge Alito expressed his \nregard for stare decisis, the Latin expression for let the decision \nstand.\n  He commented that he agrees with the position of Chief Justice \nRehnquist on the Miranda case involving suspects' rights on statements \nand confessions. Chief Justice Rehnquist, earlier in his career, had \nbeen against Miranda and later changed his view to support Miranda \nonce, as the Chief Justice put it, it became embedded in the culture of \npolice practices. And Judge Alito stated that he thought there was \nweight to be accorded to cultural changes.\n  I think it is fair to have that statement of principle apply on a \nwoman's right to choose.\n  Judge Alito later testified that he agreed with Justice Harlan's \ndissent in the case of Poe v. Ullman, that the constitution is a living \ndocument; and that agreed with Justice Carodza in Palko v. Connecticut \nthat it reflects the changing values and mores of our society.\n  He is not an originalist. He does not look only original intent. He \ndoes not look only to the static black letter, but he understands the \nimportance of evolving values and of evolving reliance.\n  I questioned him at length about the reliance factor in Casey v. \nPlanned Parenthood. I think Judge Alito went as far as he could go on \nthe assurances of maintaining an open mind on this important subject.\n  When it came to the issue as to whether he reviewed it and regarded \nit as settled law, his testimony was virtually identical to the \ntestimony of Chief Justice Roberts, who testified that it was settled. \nAs Chief Justice Roberts put it in his confirmation hearings, it is \nsettled beyond that. Chief Justice Roberts left open the unquestionable \nright and duty of the Court to review all cases on the merits when they \nare presented and to afford appropriate weight to stare decisis and to \nprecedents, but not to take the position that precedents can never be \noverturned.\n  I think a fair reading of the record is that Judge Alito went about \nas far as he could go without answering the question as to how he would \nrule on a specific case, which would be beyond the purview of what a \nnominee ought to do.\n  In taking up questions of Executive power, Judge Alito could not \nanswer questions posed about the President's authority to go to war \nwith Iran. How could a nominee answer a question of that magnitude in a \nnomination proceeding without knowing a lot more about the \ncircumstances? And judges make decisions after they have a case and \ncontroversy, when they have briefs admitted, when they have arguments \nprepared, when they have discussions with their colleagues, and they \nreflect on a matter and come to conclusion, not sitting at a witness \ntable in a Judiciary Committee hearing. Judge Alito answered the \nquestions as to the considerations which would be involved. Again, he \nwent about as far as he could go.\n\n  On the question of congressional power, I questioned him at length on \nconcerns I have about what the Supreme Court has had to say about \ndeclaring acts of Congress unconstitutional because the Supreme Court \ndisagrees with our ``method of reasoning.'' The columns of the Senate \nbuilding are lined up exactly with those of the Supreme Court, situated \nacross the green. An interesting historical note, in an early draft of \nthe Constitution, the Senate was to nominate Supreme Court Justices. \nThat would be an interesting process, given the political complexion of \nthe Senate today.\n  Back to the point. What superior wisdom and what superior method of \nreasoning comes when a person crosses the green to the Supreme Court of \nthe United States? Our method of reasoning may not be too good, but it \nis our method of reasoning. To have the Court say that they declare \nacts unconstitutional because they do not like our method of reasoning \nis, candidly stated, highly insulting. Judge Alito said the obvious: \nOur method of reasoning was as good as the Court's.\n  Then in the decision on the Americans with Disabilities Act, where \nthe Supreme Court has imposed a test of what is proportionate, taking \nit out of thin air in a 1997 decision, what is ``congruent and \nproportionate'' is a test which cannot be applied with any consistency. \nIt lends itself to legislation from the bench. Justice Scalia \ncharacterized it accurately, calling it ``a flabby test,'' where the \nCourt was functioning as the taskmaster of Congress to see that we had \ndone our homework. Judge Alito's answers showed an appropriate respect \nfor separation of powers and congressional authority.\n  The decisions of the Supreme Court questioning the constitutionality \nof statutes has led a number of Senators on the committee to prepare \nlegislation which would give the Congress standing to go to the Supreme \nCourt to argue to uphold our legislation. We thought initially about \nhaving a Judiciary Committee observe what the Court had done and from \nthat, thought about seeking to intervene as amicus curiae, as a friend \nof the court, and took it the final step: Why not go to the Court and \nargue our cases ourselves, through counsel, which is an appropriate \nway. Congress has the authority to grant standing. We can grant \nstanding to ourselves to see to it that our views are appropriately \npresented to the Court.\n  We respect the Court as the final arbiter of the Constitution. That \nis our system. But the arguments and the considerations and the record \nwhich Congress amasses ought to be considered by the Court. Now the \nconstitutionality of statutes is upheld by the Solicitor General. But \nin cases where there is a conflict between what the Congress has to say \nand what the President has to say, we ought to be in a position to make \nour own submissions to the Court.\n  The issue of Executive authority and the current surveillance \npractices came up for discussion in Judge Alito's confirmation \nhearings. Again, he could not say how he would rule on the case if it \ncame before him. He would have to read the briefs, hear the arguments, \nconsider it. But he responded by giving us the factors and items which \nhe would consider.\n  Many issues were discussed. Judge Alito approached them with an open \nmind. One subject of particular concern to this Senator is the issue of \ntelevising the Court, which I think ought to be done. The Supreme Court \nof the United States today makes the final decisions on so many of the \ncutting-edge questions of our time. The American people ought to know \nwhat is going on. A number of the Justices appear on television \nprograms. There is\n\n[[Page S42]]\n\nno reason why the Court proceedings should not be televised. Senator \nBiden and I made that specific request on the case of Bush vs. Gore and \ngot a response from Chief Justice Rehnquist denying it; however, they \nreleased an oral transcript of the proceedings at the end of the day \nand the Court is doing more of that, which is a step forward.\n  The Congress has the authority to make decisions on the \nadministration of the Court. For example, the Congress decides how many \nSupreme Court Justices there will be. We established the number at \nnine. Remember, in the Roosevelt era there was an effort to pack the \nCourt and increase the number to 15. That is a congressional judgment. \nWe decide when the Court starts to function: The third Monday in \nOctober. We decide what is a quorum of the Court: Six. We legislate on \nspeedy trial rules. It is within the purview of the Congress to \nlegislate, to call for the televising of their proceedings. I recognize \nthe ultimate decision would rest with the Court if they decided to \ndeclare our act unconstitutional. Under separation of powers, that is \ntheir prerogative. I respect it. We ought to speak to the subject.\n  On the subject of television, again, Judge Alito did not give the \nanswer I liked to hear--that he is for television in the Court--but he \nsaid he had an open mind and would consider it. Again, that is about as \nfar as he could go.\n  One panel of particularly impressive witnesses was seven judges from \nthe Court of Appeals from the Third Circuit who had worked with Judge \nAlito. There is precedence for judges testifying. Retired Chief Justice \nWarren Burger came in to testify in the nomination proceedings for \nJudge Bork. That is something for which there is precedent. These \njudges have unique knowledge of Judge Alito because they have worked \nwith him in many cases.\n  Judge Becker, for example, former Chief Judge of the Third Circuit, \nnow on senior status, sat with Judge Alito on more than 1,000 cases. \nJudge Becker has a national reputation as an outstanding jurist. \nRecently, he received the award as the outstanding Federal judge in the \ncountry. He testified about Judge Alito not having an agenda, not being \nan ideologue and having an open mind.\n  Judge Becker is regarded very much as a judge's judge, a centrist \njudge, and pointed out he and Judge Alito have disagreed very few \ntimes--about 25 times--during the course of considering more than 1,000 \ncases.\n  After the arguments are concluded, the three judges who sit on the \npanel retire and discuss the case among themselves; no clerks present, \nno secretaries present, just a candid discussion about what went on. \nThat is where the judges really let their hair down and talk about the \ncases and get to know what a judge thinks. It is a high testimonial to \nJudge Alito that these judges sang his praises, in terms of openness \nand in terms of studiousness and in terms of not having an agenda.\n  One of the witnesses, former Judge Tim Lewis of the Third Circuit, an \nAfrican American, testified about his own dedication to choice for a \nwoman's right to choose, his own dedication to civil rights, civil \nliberties, and testified very forcefully on Judge Alito's behalf. He \nsaid very bluntly he would not be there if he did not have total \nconfidence in Judge Alito.\n  One further comment: That is on the party-line vote which we seem to \nbe coming to. He was voted out of committee, 10 to 8; 10 Republicans \nvoting for Judge Alito; 8 Democrats voting against Judge Alito. It is \nunfortunate our Senate is so polarized today. I believe this Senate and \nthis body would benefit greatly by more independence in the Senate.\n  I have not voted in favor of Judge Alito as a matter of party \nloyalty. If I thought he was not qualified, I would vote no, as I have \nin the past on nominees of my own party from Presidents of my own \nparty.\n  But we need to move away from the kind of partisanship, which has \nripped this body in recent times. I think it is important the American \npeople have confidence in what the Senate does on the merits and that \nwe avoid projecting the appearance of rank politics.\n  I believe it is important for Judge Alito to have supporters who \nfavor a woman's right to choose so he does not feel in any way beholden \nto or confirmed by people who have one or another idea on some of these \nquestions. Without naming names and identifying people, we have more \nthan six Republicans who are pro-choice, who support a woman's right to \nchoose. So the balance of power will be, if confirmed, not only on one \nside of that issue or another.\n  But I think we would do well to reexamine the procedures which we \nutilize in the confirmation process to try to move away from \npartisanship and towards getting an idea of the judge's temperament, \nhis background, his jurisprudence, where he stands, without pressing \nhim to the wall as to how he stands on any particular issue.\n  When we had the nomination of White House Counsel Harriet Miers, she \nwas opposed by some because, as one person put it, there was no \nguarantee she would vote to overturn Roe. Well, you cannot get \nguarantees from Supreme Court nominees. I have said before, and I think \nit is worth repeating, guarantees are for used cars and washing \nmachines. They are not for nominees to the Supreme Court of the United \nStates.\n  I think, when we examine temperament and background, including \njurisprudence, those are the appropriate tests. No one knows with \ncertainty how Judge Alito is going to vote. The cases are full of \nsurprises. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was very much opposed to \nabortion rights before she came to the Court. And she has been one of \nthe foremost proponents of a woman's right to choose, subject to some \nlimitations. Justice Anthony Kennedy spoke very disparagingly about \nabortion rights before coming to the Court, and he has supported Roe v. \nWade. Justice David Souter, as attorney general for New Hampshire, \nopposed repealing New Hampshire's law banning abortions, even after it \nhad been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United \nStates. The National Organization for Women had a rally on Capitol Hill \nwhen David Souter was up for confirmation in 1991--I remember it well; \nI was there--with big placards ``Stop Souter or Women Will Die.'' \nJustice Souter, too, has supported Roe v. Wade.\n  So no one knows what will happen. President Truman was disappointed \nby his nominees in the famous steel seizure case. Again and again and \nagain, there have been surprises. The rule is, there is no rule. So on \nthe committee and in the Senate we are left to our best judgment as to \nqualifications without guarantees. The separation of powers entrusts to \nthe President the role of making the nominations. It is up to the \nSenate to make an evaluation and then to confirm or not confirm. After \nthat, it is up to the Justices to make the decisions on the Court. The \nseparation of powers has served us well.\n  Those are the facts which have led me to vote Judge Alito out of \ncommittee affirmatively. And my vote will be cast when the roll is \ncalled later in this floor debate.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                         alito floor statement\n\n       Mr. President, today the Senate begins the debate on the \n     confirmation of Judge Samuel A. Alito to be an Associate \n     Justice of the United States Supreme Court.\n       It has been 86 days, nearly three months, since President \n     Bush announced his choice of Judge Samuel Alito to fill the \n     seat being vacated by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. During \n     this time, my staff and I have undertaken an extensive review \n     of Judge Alito's record, including an examination of his 238 \n     major decisions while serving on the Third Circuit Court of \n     Appeals, a review of 49 of the cases Judge Alito handled \n     during his tenure as a United States Attorney, analyses of 43 \n     speeches and articles Judge Alito authored, and evaluations \n     of the 38 formal opinions, petitions, and Supreme Court \n     briefs which Judge Alito wrote while serving in the \n     Department of Justice. Additionally, the Judiciary Committee \n     held 30 hours and 20 minutes of hearings, which included 17 \n     hours and 45 minutes of questioning of Judge Alito and \n     testimony from 33 outside witnesses.\n       Based on my thorough review of his record, I intend to vote \n     to confirm Judge Alito as the 110th Justice of the United \n     States Supreme Court. I did not reach this decision lightly. \n     As I have said before, except for a declaration of war or its \n     virtual equivalent, a resolution for the use of force, no \n     Senate vote is as important as the confirmation of a Supreme \n     Court justice. And this vote is one that requires Senators to \n     free themselves from the straight-jacket of party loyalty and \n     exercise independent judgment. Under separation of powers, \n     Senators are separate from\n\n[[Page S43]]\n\n     the executive branch and have a full, independent role in \n     staffing the Third Branch of government. I have long adhered \n     to this view, which led me to vote against Judge Bork's \n     confirmation, even though he was nominated by a President of \n     my own party. If I thought Judge Alito should not be \n     confirmed, I would vote no again.\n       Judge Alito has sterling academic credentials, having \n     excelled at Princeton University and the Yale Law School. \n     Judge Alito began his lifetime commitment to public service \n     with a prestigious clerkship for Judge Leon I. Garth of the \n     United States Court of Appeals of the Third Circuit. For the \n     next thirteen years, Judge Alito served his country as an \n     Assistant to the U.S. Solicitor General, a Deputy Assistant \n     Attorney General in the Office of Legal Counsel, and as both \n     the United States Attorney for New Jersey and an assistant \n     United States Attorney in that same office. When Judge Alito \n     was appointed to his current position on the Third Circuit \n     Court of Appeals, the ABA unanimously voted to award Judge \n     Alito its highest possible rating, and Judge Alito enjoyed \n     broad bipartisan support, as reflected by the fact that he \n     was confirmed by unanimous consent.\n       Judge Alito's achievements are all the more impressive when \n     one realizes that Judge Alito was not born with a silver \n     spoon in his mouth. Judge Alito's father was brought to this \n     country from Italy as an infant and grew up in poverty. \n     Although his father graduated at the top of his high school \n     class, he had no money for college, and he was set to work in \n     a factory. It was only because at the last minute, a kind \n     person arranged for him to receive a $50 scholarship, that he \n     was able to attend college. Despite the discrimination he \n     faced as an Italian immigrant in 1935, Judge Alito's father \n     eventually became a teacher, served in the Pacific during \n     World War II, and held a nonpartisan position for the New \n     Jersey Legislature. Judge Alito put it best when he said:\n       ``my parents taught me through the stories of their lives . \n     . . and it is the story, as far as I can see it, about the \n     opportunities that our country offers and also about the need \n     for fairness and about hard work and perseverance and the \n     power of a small good deed.''\n       I have participated in the confirmation hearings for the \n     past eleven nominees to the Supreme Court. Although judgments \n     may differ, I think that Judge Alito went farther in \n     answering questions than most Justices in the past. Indeed, \n     Senator Biden commented, ``you have been very gracious. I \n     appreciate you being responsive.'' By one reckoning, Judge \n     Alito was asked 677 questions and answered some 659--97%. \n     That is far more than Justice Ginsburg, who answered only 307 \n     out of 384 questions, or 80%, or Justice Breyer, who answered \n     only 291 out of 355 questions, or 82%. Judge Alito did not \n     refuse to respond because a similar case might come before \n     the Court. He ultimately stopped short of making commitments \n     as to how he would vote, as he should. But for each topic \n     that was raised, Judge Alito discussed the relevant \n     constitutional considerations and his judicial philosophy.\n       For example, on the topic of a woman's right to choose, \n     Judge Alito agreed that the Constitution creates a right to \n     privacy. I asked Judge Alito whether he agreed with the \n     Supreme Court's holding in Eisenstadt, which established that \n     unmarried women have a constitutional right to contraception \n     and was an underpinning of the Supreme Court's decision in \n     Roe v. Wade. Judge Alito replied directly, ``I do agree with \n     the result in Eisenstadt.'' When Senator Feinstein asked \n     Judge Alito whether the Constitution guarantees a right to \n     privacy, Judge Alito responded: ``The 14th Amendment protects \n     liberty. The Fifth Amendment protects liberty. And I think it \n     is well accepted that this has a substantive component, and \n     that that component includes aspects of privacy that have \n     constitutional protection.''\n       Judge Alito also discussed whether Roe v. Wade is so well \n     established that it should not be overturned. Judge Alito \n     stated: ``I agree that in every case in which there is a \n     prior precedent, the first issue is the issue of stare \n     decisis, and the presumption is that the Court will follow \n     its prior precedents. There needs to be a special \n     justification for overruling a prior precedent.''\n       Some Members of the Judiciary Committee have argued that \n     Judge Alito was less forthcoming on this issue than Chief \n     Justice Roberts was during his Supreme Court confirmation \n     hearing, when he called Roe v. Wade ``settled law.'' \n     Comparing the testimony of the two nominees, I cannot see a \n     dime's worth of difference between their responses. I asked \n     Chief Justice Roberts what he meant when, as a nominee for \n     the circuit court, he said Roe was settled law. \n     Specifically, I asked him if he meant it was settled for \n     him as a circuit court judge, or if it was settled beyond \n     that, even as a Supreme Court Justice. He answered: \n     ``beyond that, it's settled as a precedent of the Court, \n     entitled to respect under principles of stare decisis.''\n       Similarly, Judge Alito testified that ``Roe v. Wade is an \n     important precedent of the Supreme Court'' and that the \n     Court's reaffirmation of that case ``strengthens its value as \n     stare decisis.'' Moreover, both Chief Justice Roberts and \n     Judge Samuel Alito testified that they agreed with the result \n     in Eisenstadt, that unmarried people may not be denied \n     contraception, and with the foundational case of Griswold v. \n     Connecticut, which guaranteed that same right to married \n     couples. Both Chief Justice Roberts and Judge Samuel Alito \n     agreed that with the view that the Constitution's Due Process \n     Clause includes a substantive protection of privacy--the \n     legal view underpinning Roe v. Wade. And both Chief Justice \n     Roberts and Judge Samuel Alito refused to make commitments on \n     how they would vote in abortion cases, including how they \n     would rule if Roe came before the Court again. This is as it \n     should be: no nominee for the Supreme Court or any other \n     Court should be required to commit to how they would rule on \n     a potential case before them.\n       I was pleased to hear Judge Alito confirm that he does view \n     the Constitution as a living document. Judge Alito stated, \n     ``I think the Constitution is a living thing in the sense \n     that matters, and that is . . . it sets up a framework of \n     Government and a protection of fundamental rights that we \n     have lived under very successfully for 200 years, and the \n     genius of it is that it is not terribly specific on certain \n     things. It sets out some things are very specific, but it \n     sets out some general principles, and then leaves it for each \n     generation to apply those to the particular factual \n     situations that come up. . . . As times change, new factual \n     situations come up, and the principles have to be applied to \n     those situations. The principles don't change. The \n     Constitution itself doesn't change, but the factual \n     situations change, and as new situations come up, the \n     principles and the rights have to be applied to them.''\n       Judge Alito's record confirms that he is not an ideologue \n     on a crusade to curtail Roe v. Wade. He has upheld a woman's \n     right to choose even when he had the discretion to limit \n     abortion rights. For example, in the 1995 case of Elizabeth \n     Blackwell Medical Center for Women v. Knoll, Judge Alito \n     struck down two abortion restrictions by the State of \n     Pennsylvania. The first provided that a woman who became \n     pregnant due to rape or incest could not obtain Medicaid \n     funding for her abortion unless she reported the crime to the \n     police. The second provided that if a woman needed an \n     abortion to save her life, she had to obtain a second opinion \n     from a doctor who had no financial interest in the abortion. \n     The question was whether these laws conflicted with a federal \n     regulation issued by the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services. The case did not involve a question of \n     constitutional law. There was no binding Supreme Court \n     precedent on point. Judge Alito easily could have upheld the \n     abortion restrictions if he wished to. Indeed, another Third \n     Circuit judge appointed by President Reagan voted to do just \n     that. But Judge Alito voted to strike down both laws in favor \n     of a woman's right to choose. This is not the behavior of \n     someone bent on chipping away at Roe v. Wade. This is the \n     behavior of a moderate jurist who understands the importance \n     of precedent.\n       The fact is that, notwithstanding Senators' concerted \n     efforts, it is not possible to predict how Judge Alito will \n     rule on the issue of abortion. If there is a rule on \n     expectations, it is probably one of surprise. Two or three \n     decades ago, no one would have predicted that Justices \n     O'Connor, Kennedy, or Souter would have voted to uphold a \n     woman's right to choose. At her confirmation hearing, Justice \n     O'Connor testified that she personally viewed abortion with \n     ``abhorrence'' and stated, ``my own view in the area of \n     abortion is that I am opposed to it as a matter of birth \n     control or otherwise.'' Yet, roughly 10 years later, she \n     voted to uphold Roe v. Wade and has done so ever since. \n     Justice Kennedy explained that he ``was brought up to think \n     of abortion as a great evil. He once denounced the Roe \n     decision as the Dred Scott of our time, a reference to the \n     infamous 1857 ruling that sanctioned slavery and helped spark \n     the Civil War.'' Yet, in 1992, Justice Kennedy cast the \n     deciding vote in Casey v. Planned Parenthood to uphold Roe v. \n     Wade. When he was New Hampshire Attorney General, Justice \n     Souter filed a brief arguing that tax payer dollars should \n     not be used to fund ``the killing of unborn children'' and \n     defended abortion laws that had already been undermined by \n     Roe v. Wade. During his confirmation hearing, the National \n     Organization for Women organized a rally against his \n     confirmation entitled ``Do or Die Day'' and distributed \n     flyers proclaiming ``Stop Souter or women will die.'' Yet, on \n     the Supreme Court, Justice Souter has consistently voted to \n     uphold a woman's right to choose.\n       Similarly, there have been dire predictions about Judge \n     Samuel Alito. The National Organization for Women has \n     released another flyer--this one declaring ``Save Women's \n     Lives. Vote No on Alito.'' The rule is that there is no rule.\n       Judge Alito was also questioned extensively on Executive \n     power and whether the resolution for the authorization of use \n     of force gave the President authority to engage in electronic \n     surveillance. When I asked Judge Alito whether he agreed with \n     Justice O'Connor's statement in Hamdi that ``We have long \n     since made clear that a state of war is not a blank check for \n     the President when it comes to the rights of the Nation's \n     citizens,'' Judge Alito responded, ``Absolutely. That's a \n     very important principle. Our Constitution applies in times \n     of peace and in times of war, and it protects the rights of \n     Americans under all circumstances.'' Judge Alito went \n     somewhat beyond the usual practice of answering just as many \n     questions as he needed to in order to be confirmed. While he \n     would not commit to giving answers to hypothetical situations \n     which may come before the Court, he fully explained his \n     methods of reasoning. For example, when questioned by me and \n     other\n\n[[Page S44]]\n\n     Senators about how he would decide questions dealing with the \n     limits of executive power, he responded that he would apply \n     Justice Jackson's framework from the Youngstown Steel case:\n       ``[A]s I said, the President has to follow the Constitution \n     and the laws and, in fact, one of the most solemn \n     responsibilities of the President--and it is set out \n     expressly in the Constitution--is that the President is to \n     take care that the laws are faithfully executed, and that \n     means the Constitution, it means statutes, it means treaties, \n     it means all of the laws of the United States.\n       ``But what I am saying is that sometimes issues of \n     Executive power arise and they have to be analyzed under the \n     framework that Justice Jackson set out. And you do get cases \n     that are in this twilight zone and it is--they have to be \n     decided when they come up based on the specifics of the \n     situation.''\n       When Judge Alito was similarly questioned about the \n     President's power to control the executive branch, he \n     responded by explaining in full:\n       ``[A]s to the agencies that are headed by commissions, the \n     members of which are appointed for terms, and there are \n     limitations placed on removal, the precedents--the leading \n     precedent is Humphrey's Executor and that is reinforced, and \n     I would say very dramatically reinforced, by the decision in \n     Morrison, which did not involve such an agency. It involved \n     an officer who was carrying out what I think everyone would \n     agree is a core function of the executive branch, which is \n     the enforcement of the law, taking care that the laws are \n     faithfully executed. . . .\n       ``[W]hat I have tried to say is that I regard this as a \n     line of precedent that is very well developed and I have no \n     quarrel with it and it culminates in Morrison, in which the \n     Supreme Court said that even as to an inferior officer who is \n     carrying out the core executive function of taking care that \n     the laws are faithfully executed, it is permissible for \n     Congress to place restrictions on the ability of the \n     President to remove such an officer, provided that in doing \n     so, there is no interference with the President's authority, \n     and they found no interference with that authority there. \n     That is an expression of the Supreme Court's view on an issue \n     where the claim for--where the claim that there should be no \n     removal restrictions imposed is far stronger than it is with \n     respect to an independent agency like the one involved in \n     Humphrey's Executor.''\n       I have expressed my concern, for some time now, about the \n     case of United States v. Morrison, where the Supreme Court \n     declared part of the Violence Against Women Act \n     unconstitutional. The majority opinion in that case dismissed \n     lengthy Congressional findings because five justices \n     disagreed with our ``method of reasoning.'' The inference was \n     that they believed the Court has a superior method of \n     reasoning to the Congress. I believe that the Constitutional \n     separation of powers rejects that kind of view and I know \n     that many of my colleagues share this concern.\n       I asked Chief Justice Roberts about this during his \n     confirmation hearings and I raised it again with Judge Alito. \n     Judge Alito said that: ``I would never suggest that judges \n     have superior reasoning power than does Congress . . . I \n     think that Congress' ability to reason is fully equal to that \n     of the judiciary.''\n       The Judiciary Committee had the rare, but not \n     unprecedented, opportunity to hear from seven of Judge \n     Alito's current and former colleagues on the Third Circuit. \n     These men and women, Democrat and Republican appointees, know \n     his record best. They have heard cases with him and sat in \n     conference with him, they have worked to craft opinions with \n     him. The process that appellate judges go through in \n     rendering decisions is not familiar to many people and it was \n     very instructive to have the insight of these judges.\n       Judge Edward Becker, the former Chief Judge of the Third \n     Circuit is one of the most acclaimed jurists of our time. He \n     recently won the coveted Devitt Award as the Outstanding \n     Federal Jurist of the year. I know Judge Becker very well \n     since our college and law school days, so, I take his views \n     seriously.\n       Judge Becker has sat on over a thousand cases with Judge \n     Alito and, as he testified, they only disagreed 27 times. In \n     each of those cases, Judge Becker testified, Judge Alito's \n     ``position was closely reasoned and supportable either by the \n     record or by his interpretation of the law, or both.'' Judge \n     Becker testified that he knows Judge Alito approaches judging \n     with no agenda and was not an ideologue. He said, ``The Sam \n     Alito that I have sat with for 15 years is not an ideologue. \n     He is not a movement person. He is a real judge deciding each \n     case on the facts and the law, not on his personal views, \n     whatever they may be. He scrupulously adheres to precedent. I \n     have never seen him exhibit a bias against any class of \n     litigation or litigants.''\n       The current Chief Judge of the Third Circuit, Judge Anthony \n     Scirica, confirmed this view of Judge Alito, as did Judge \n     Maryanne Trump Barry, and all the other current and retired \n     judges who testified.\n       I thought that the testimony of Judge Timothy Lewis was \n     particularly influential, given his background. He is an \n     African American who described himself at the hearing as \n     ``unapologetically pro-choice'' and as ``a committed human \n     rights and civil rights activist.'' He joked that it was no \n     coincidence that he happened to be sitting at the ``far \n     left'' end of the panel of judges.\n       Still, based on his personal knowledge of the kind of judge \n     Judge Alito is, Judge Lewis spoke enthusiastically in his \n     favor. He said: ``having worked with him, I came to respect \n     what I think are the most important qualities for anyone who \n     puts on a robe, no matter what court they will serve on, but \n     in particular the United States Supreme Court, and first and \n     foremost among these is intellectual honesty.''\n       He testified that ``I cannot recall one instance during \n     conference or during any other experience that I had with \n     Judge Alito, but in particular during conference, when he \n     exhibited anything remotely resembling an ideological bent. \n     That does not mean that I agreed with him, but he did not \n     come to conference or come to any decision that he made \n     during the time that I worked with him based on what I \n     perceived to be an ideological bent or a result-oriented \n     demeanor or approach. He was intellectually honest, and I \n     would say rigorously so, even with respect to those areas \n     that he and I did not agree.''\n       In the area of civil rights, Judge Alito has a strong \n     record. In his tenure as the U.S Attorney for New Jersey, he \n     took steps to diversify the office--hiring and promoting \n     women and minorities. Since taking the bench, he has \n     continued to demonstrate a commitment to civil rights. Of \n     course, when a judge has decided over 4,800 cases, as Judge \n     Alito has, it is possible to select a few of his cases to \n     place him at any and every position on the judicial spectrum. \n     But, on balance, Judge Alito's record in this area is more \n     than satisfactory.\n       Again, Judge Lewis's testimony is instructive. He told the \n     Committee that ``[I]f I believed that Sam Alito might be \n     hostile to civil rights as a member of the United States \n     Supreme Court, I can guarantee you that I would not be \n     sitting here today.'' Coming from some one with an \n     unquestioned commitment to civil rights who has worked \n     closely with Judge Alito, that testimony is entitled to \n     considerable weight.\n       Judge Lewis' testimony supported my view of Judge Alito \n     from examining his cases. Indeed, I have found many cases \n     where he has defended civil rights and the interests of \n     African Americans. For example:\n       In U.S. v. Kithcart, Judge Alito held that the Fourth \n     Amendment does not allow police to target drivers because of \n     the color of their skin. After a police officer received a \n     report that two black men in a black sports car had committed \n     three robberies, she pulled over the first black man in a \n     black sports car she saw. Judge Alito ruled that this \n     violated the Constitution.\n       In Brinson v. Vaughn, Judge Alito ruled that the \n     Constitution does not allow prosecutors to exclude African \n     Americans from juries. In that case, the prosecutor had used \n     13 of his 14 ``strikes'' to exclude African-Americans from \n     the jury, but argued that this was not a problem, because he \n     allowed 3 African-Americans onto the jury. Judge Alito \n     explained that the prosecutor could not get around the \n     Constitution by allowing a handful of African-Americans onto \n     the jury.\n       In Zubi v. AT Corp., Judge Alito authored a lone dissent, \n     opposing the establishment of a stringent limitations period \n     in which civil-rights plaintiffs would have to file a claim. \n     The Supreme Court unanimously vindicated Judge Alito's \n     position four years later.\n       In Reynolds v. USX Corporation, Judge Alito ruled in favor \n     of Deborah Reynolds, an African-American woman who was \n     subjected to racial and sexual harassment at work. Her \n     employer claimed that the company shouldn't be liable because \n     the harassment came from her coworkers, rather than \n     supervisors. Alito concluded that her supervisors were aware \n     of the harassment and the company had a duty to end it.\n       During Judge Alito's time on the bench he has also \n     demonstrated great sensitivity to the unique challenges faced \n     by people with disabilities. He understands that people with \n     disabilities are still subject to discrimination in our \n     society and that they are entitled to full civil rights. As \n     he testified at his hearing: ``When I have a case involving \n     someone who's been subjected to discrimination because of \n     disability, I have to think of people who I've known and \n     admired very greatly who had disabilities and I've watched \n     them struggle to overcome the barriers that society puts up, \n     often just because it doesn't think of what it's doing, the \n     barriers that it puts up to them.''\n       He has issued several important decisions vindicating the \n     rights of people with disabilities. Thomas v. Commissioner of \n     Social Security, which Judge Alito discussed at his hearing, \n     is a good example of this. It is also one of the few cases \n     where Judge Alito was reversed by the Supreme Court--in this \n     instance unanimously--because the Court thought that Judge \n     Alito went too far to protect the ``little guy.''\n       In that case, Judge Alito ruled in favor of a woman with \n     disabilities who sought social security benefits. The Social \n     Security Administration concluded that the plaintiff was not \n     entitled to benefits because she could still perform her \n     former job as an elevator operator--even though such jobs no \n     longer exist. Judge Alito thought that such a rigid \n     application of the law ``sets up an artificial roadblock'' to \n     people seeking disability benefits. He saw ``no plausible \n     reason why Congress might have wanted to deny benefits to an \n     otherwise qualified person simply because that person, \n     although unable to perform any job that actually exists in \n     the national economy, could perform a previous job that no \n     longer exists.''\n\n[[Page S45]]\n\n       Thomas is only one example of Judge Alito's strong record \n     on disability rights. He has ruled in favor of numerous \n     workers, students, customers, and disability advocacy groups \n     on disability-related claims. Often times, he has reversed \n     the rulings of lower courts to do so. Other examples include:\n       Shapiro v. Township of Lakewood, where Judge Alito authored \n     the majority opinion in favor of an EMT technician who became \n     disabled on the job and was denied an interdepartmental \n     transfer to a position as a police dispatcher.\n       Fiscus v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., where Judge Alito ruled in \n     favor of a victim of disability discrimination who suffered \n     from end-stage renal disease and sought permission from her \n     employer to self-administer dialysis every four to six hours \n     during the workday. Judge Alito voted to reverse the lower \n     courts ruling that kidney failure was not covered by the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act.\n       Mondzelweski v. Pathmark Stores Inc., where Judge Alito \n     ruled in favor of a meat cutter who became injured on the job \n     and could no longer lift heavy objects. He overturned the \n     judgment of a lower court that refused to consider his \n     disability in light of his low education and skill level. \n     Judge Alito believe that the impact of a disability had an \n     individual's inability to work must take into account his \n     particular background and skills.\n       Shore Regional High School Board of Education v. P.S., \n     where Judge Alito again reversed a lower court to find in \n     favor of a plaintiff with disabilities. The plaintiff in that \n     case was a child with disabilities who had suffered severe \n     harassment from bullies at his school. Because an \n     Administrative Law Judge had found that the student could not \n     get an appropriate education in this environment, Judge Alito \n     ruled that the students' parents should be reimbursed for \n     tuition at a neighboring public high school.\n       Pennsylvania Protection & Advocacy, Inc. v. Houstoun, where \n     Judge Alito sided with a group advocating for the rights of \n     the mentally ill and ordered a state hospital to release \n     internal reports on the death of a patient who attempted \n     suicide and later died under hospital care. He rejected the \n     state of Pennsylvania's arguments that these documents were \n     protected from release under state law.\n       Judge Alito has authored a number of other important, \n     progressive, opinions, vindicating the rights of the so-\n     called ``little guy''. For example, in Fatin v. INS, Judge \n     Alito held that an Iranian woman could establish a basis for \n     asylum if she showed that compliance with Iran's gender \n     specific laws would be deeply abhorrent to her or that the \n     Iranian government would persecute her because of her gender. \n     This is a landmark case that established gender-based \n     discrimination as possible grounds for asylum.\n       In Alexander v. University of Pittsburgh Medical Center \n     System, Judge Alito dissented from the court's ruling in \n     favor of a hospital in a medical malpractice case. A young \n     woman had been hospitalized for a rare illness of the liver. \n     Based on advice from several doctors, her parents waited for \n     one and one-half months before ordering a liver transplant. \n     The young girl died, and the parents sued. The jury ruled for \n     the parents and awarded substantial damages. The majority of \n     the Third Circuit reversed the jury's verdict against the \n     doctors, explaining that the trial court judge should have \n     instructed the jurors to consider whether the parents were \n     partly responsible for the young girl's death. Judge Alito \n     dissented, concluding that the fault for any poor decision \n     rested with the defendant doctors, not the parents. Judge \n     Alito wrote: ``Except perhaps in truly extreme cases, it is \n     not negligent for a patient such as Alyssa or her parents to \n     follow the advice of primary care physicians.''\n       In Cort v. Director, Judge Alito wrote an opinion ruling \n     for and awarding benefits to a former coal miner under the \n     Black Lung Benefits Act. An Administrative Law Judge had \n     denied the worker's claim, finding that since he was able to \n     obtain work as a wire cutter, he wasn't disabled. Judge Alito \n     found that the statute and associated regulations established \n     a presumption of total disability due to Black Lung when a \n     claimant worked for more than 10 years as a miner and met one \n     of four medical requirements--which the plaintiff satisfied. \n     He reasoned that the statue focused on the source of \n     disability, not its degree.\n       These cases are just a few examples from Judge Alito's \n     lengthy record. My staff has identified and analyzed scores \n     of cases where Judge Alito has ruled for minorities, \n     immigrants, people with disabilities, prisoners, and other \n     disadvantaged plaintiffs. It is this record that has won him \n     the enthusiastic support of his fellow judges on the Third \n     Circuit.\n       Judge Alito is anything but a ``stealth'' candidate. Those \n     who opposed Chief Justice Roberts' nomination asked for a \n     nominee with a deeper record to analyze. In Judge Alito, they \n     have such a person. The Committee had the opportunity to \n     review literally thousands of decisions and some 461 written \n     opinions. It also had the opportunity to hear directly from \n     Judge Alito as he gave lengthy testimony. In three days of \n     intense questioning in which he spent over 18 hours in the \n     witness chair, Judge Alito was asked roughly 677 questions. \n     By comparison, Justice Ginsburg was asked 384 questions and \n     Justice Breyer was asked only 355 questions. Clearly, Judge \n     Alito's record has been vetted as thoroughly as any nominee's \n     possibly could be.\n       It is on the basis of this record that I reached my \n     conclusion to vote aye on the nomination of Judge Alito to be \n     an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court.\n\n  I thank the Chair and I now yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Specter for his \nexcellent leadership of the Judiciary Committee during both the Roberts \nand Alito hearings. He squarely addressed the tough issues in the first \nquestioning. He made sure every member of the committee had full and \nample opportunity to ask any question they wanted. We had 30-minute \nrounds. We had opening statements. We had the opportunity to have \nmultiple rounds. Basically, I think the people could have asked \nquestioned theses nominees for as long as they wanted.\n  Of course, both Roberts and Alito were magnificent in their \ntestimony, superb in their knowledge of the Constitution and the role \nof a judge in every possible way. That is why they have been favorably \nreceived by the American public which is why Chief Justice Roberts was \nconfirmed, and why Alito will be confirmed.\n  We have the greatest legal system in the world. It is the foundation \nof our liberties. It is the foundation of our economic prosperity. But \nthe focus and the key ingredient of our legal system is an independent \njudge who makes decisions every day based on the law and the facts, not \non their personal, political, religious, moral or social views. If we \ndescend to that level, if we allow those social, political views to \naffect or infect the decision-making process, justice has been eroded. \nThat is contrary to every ideal of the American rule of law.\n  What is important today is Judge Alito's legal philosophy. It is not \nhis political philosophy that is important. What is his legal \nphilosophy? The core of his beliefs as a judge is that a judge should \nbe careful, fair, restrained, and honest in analyzing the facts of the \ncase and applying the relevant law to those facts. For what purpose? To \ndecide that dispute, that discrete issue that is before the Court at \nthat time and not to indulge, as he indicated, in great theories. That \nis not what a judge is about.\n  So this is what American judges must do for our entire legal system \nto work. That is why I am so proud that President Bush has given us two \nnominees who can explain, articulate that role of a judge in a way \nevery American can understand, relate to, and affirm.\n  My colleagues, I am afraid, lack a proper understanding of this \nconcept. It goes to the core of our differences over judges. They want \njudges, I am afraid, who will impose their own views, their personal \nviews, on political issues in the guise of deciding discrete cases \nbefore them. Oftentimes, these are views that cannot be passed in the \npolitical, legislative process but can only be imposed by a judge who \nsimply redefines or reinterprets the meaning of words in our \nConstitution, and they declare that the Constitution says that same-sex \nmarriage must be the law of the land. They just declare that to be so. \nIt only takes five unelected, life-time appointed judges to set that \nkind of new standard for America.\n  Is there any wonder people are worried about that? It erodes \ndemocracy at its most fundamental level when political decisions are \nbeing set by judges with lifetime appointments, unaccountable to the \npublic.\n  So that is what we are worried about in so many different ways. There \nhas been a trend in that regard, no doubt about it, by our courts. I \nthink they have abused their authority by taking an extremely hostile \nview toward the expression of religious conviction in public life.\n  They have struck down Christmas displays. Our courts have declared \nour Pledge of Allegiance to the Government unconstitutional because it \nhas ``under God'' in it. By the way, for those of you who can see the \nwords over this door, ``In God We Trust,'' it is part of our heritage, \nwritten right on the wall of this Chamber.\n  This is an extreme interpretation of the separation of church and \nstate. It is not consistent with our classical understanding of law in \nAmerica. We had the Supreme Court, in this past year,\n\n[[Page S46]]\n\nredefining the takings clause. The takings clause says you can take \nprivate property for public use.\n  It does not say you can take it for any purpose, like a private mall. \nThey redefined the meaning because they thought that was smarter, \nbetter policy. But we don't appoint judges to set policy. As \nlegislators, we have that responsibility. We are the people who will be \nvoted out of office if we set bad policy. We are the ones meeting \npeople every day and campaigning, trying to understand what the \nAmerican people care about. That is not what judges do, at 80 years \nold, sitting over there reading briefs every day.\n  This is an important issue. They declared that illegal aliens, \ndespite State laws to the contrary, are entitled to benefits. They \nstruck down every partial-birth abortion law. They have declared that \nmorality--this is hard to believe but true in recent years--cannot be a \nbasis for congressional legislation. Yet they contend that they may \ndecide opinions and redefine the meaning of words and the understanding \nof words over hundreds of years based on what they declare to be \nevolving standards of decency.\n  Is that a standard or is that just a license for a judge to do \nwhatever they feel like doing at a given time? Evolving standards of \ndecency, who can define that? Do they have hearings on what these \nstandards are?\n  These are important issues. The American people are concerned about \nit. President Bush was concerned about it. He promised he would appoint \njudges who show restraint, judges of great ability and integrity but \nwho would show restraint and be more modest in the way they handle \nthese cases. That is a fair standard. It is a legitimate issue for the \nAmerican people to decide. He talked about it in almost every speech he \nmade. That is what he promised to do, and that is what he has done.\n  If we were to name judges, there is a legitimate concern that we \nwould appoint judges who would promote some conservative agenda. I \ndon't favor that; I oppose that. We don't want a judge to promote a \nliberal or a conservative agenda, although the plain fact is, if \nanybody looks at it squarely, they will see that the Court has actually \nbeen promoting a more liberal agenda. But we are not asking that a \nconservative agenda be promoted. We are asking that the courts maintain \ntheir role as a neutral umpire to decide cases based on the law passed \nby the legislative branch or State legislatures or passed by the people \nthrough the adoption of the U.S. Constitution.\n  I don't understand the opposition to Judge Alito. He is such a \nfabulous nominee. It does appear, according to the New York Times last \nweek, the 19th of January, that our Democratic leader, Senator Harry \nReid, has urged his colleagues to vote no so they can, for political \nreasons, make it a political issue. We need to be careful about that. I \nam afraid there has been an attempt to change the ground rules of \nconfirmations, to set standards we have never set before for nominees. \nThat knife cuts both ways. If this is affirmed, then there will be more \ndifficulty in the future for Democratic Presidents to have their \nnominees confirmed.\n  Judge Alito has a remarkable record. He is the son of immigrants in \nNew Jersey. His father was an immigrant to this country. He goes off to \nPrinceton, gets his degree with honors, declines to accept an \ninvitation to join an eating club that excludes women and others. I \nguess that was beneath the members of that club. He decided while he \nwas there that he would just dine with everybody else, the scruff and \nthe scrum that you find at Princeton. Then he went to Yale Law School \nwhere he finished at the top of his class, served as editor of the Yale \nLaw Journal, participated in the ROTC at a time when that was not an \neasy thing to do, served in the Army Reserve for 8 years, and was \noffended that Princeton would kick the ROTC from their campus. I am \nsure he was not pleased when the rioters bombed the ROTC building at \nPrinceton.\n  He is an American. He believes in his country. He was prepared to \nserve his country, go where he was asked to go, if called upon in that \nfashion.\n  He was chosen to clerk for the Third Circuit after he graduated, the \ncourt on which he now sits with Judge Garth. That is quite an honor. \nFor 3 years he served as assistant U.S. attorney in that great large \nNew Jersey law office for the U.S. attorney where he argued appellate \ncases. He did the appellate work. That is what he will be as a Supreme \nCourt judge, an appellate judge, not a trial judge. That is what he did \nwhen he started out his practice. Then he went to the Solicitor \nGeneral's Office of the Department of Justice, which is often referred \nto as the greatest job for an attorney in the world, to be able to \nstand up in the courts of the United States of America, particularly \nthe Supreme Court, and to represent the United States in that court. He \nargued 12 cases before the Supreme Court. Not one-half of 1 percent of \nthe lawyers in America have probably argued any case before the Supreme \nCourt. He argued 12. That is a reflection of his strength and \ncapability.\n  Then he became U.S. attorney in New Jersey, which is one of the \nlargest U.S. attorney offices in America, where he prosecuted the Mafia \nand drug organizations and was highly successful in that office and won \ngreat plaudits for his performance. He then was placed, 15 years ago, \non the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. He has served as a circuit judge \nin the Third Circuit Court of Appeals for 15 years, writing some 350 \nopinions and participating in many others.\n  He has had his record exposed to the world. What does it look like? \nWithout question, it is a record of fairness and decency. Some of us on \nthe conservative side have questioned the bar association. They are \npro-abortion in their positions. They take liberal positions on a lot \nof issues, and some people have criticized them for that. They declare \ntheir ratings of judges are not based on that. But sometimes they have \nbeen accused of allowing their personal views to infect that rating \nprocess.\n  How did the American Bar Association rate Judge Alito? They gave him \ntheir highest possible rating. They found that he was well qualified, \nunanimously, by the 15-member committee that meets to decide that \nissue. They interviewed 300 people, people who have litigated against \nJudge Alito as a private lawyer, people who have been his supervisors, \npeople who have worked for him, people who had their cases decided by \nhim.\n  They go out and talk to these people. They will share with the \nAmerican Bar Association privately what they might not say publicly. So \nthey interviewed 300 people, and contacted over 2,000. They concluded \nthat Judge Alito has established a record of both proper judicial \nconduct and evenhanded application in seeking to do what is \nfundamentally fair.\n  They declare that Judge Alito was held ``in incredibly high regard.'' \nThat was said by attorney John Payton, an African American who argued \nthe University of Michigan quota case before the U.S. Supreme Court, \nnot a rightwinger. He said they found the people they interviewed held \nJudge Alito in incredibly high regard. I asked him if he chose that \nword carefully. He said: I did; yes, sir.\n  Judge Alito represents that neutral magistrate that we look for in \nour judges in America. His academic record is superb. His proven \nintelligence is unsurpassed. The experience he brings to the U.S. \nSupreme Court is extraordinary, including 15 years as an appellate \njudge doing in a lower court basically the same thing one would do at \nthe Supreme Court level.\n  This is what he said at the hearing:\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The majority's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds \nto wrap up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I understand our side will also get an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. This is what he said:\n\n       I had the good fortune to begin my legal career as a law \n     clerk for a judge who really epitomized openmindedness and \n     fairness. He read the record in detail in every single case. \n     He insisted on following precedent, both the precedents of \n     the Supreme Court and the decisions of his own court. He \n     taught all of his law clerks that every case had to be \n     decided on an individual basis. He really didn't have much \n     use for grand theories.\n\n  That is what we need on the bench today. I think it would restore the \npublic confidence. I am proud to support this nomination.\n\n[[Page S47]]\n\n  Mr. President, I respect Senator Leahy. He is an excellent advocate \nfor the Democratic side. I was pleased he supported Judge Roberts, and \nI am not as thrilled he is not supporting Judge Alito. It was a process \nthat was a bit rough at times, but fundamentally I think the judge was \nable to have his day in court.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we may go a \ncouple of minutes beyond 12 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the compliment of the Senator \nfrom Alabama. I have spent 31 years in the Senate. I take my role in \nthe Senate very seriously. I believe we should be the conscience of the \nNation. As I have said many times, only 18 people get to publicly ask \nquestions of the Supreme Court nominees. They are the 18 Members of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. We are asking those questions on behalf of \nalmost 300 million Americans, and then 100 of us get a chance to vote \non it.\n  While the Senator from Alabama is still on the floor, I note that \nthere seem to be talking points going around that the Democratic \nleader, Senator Reid, has been lobbying to make this a party-line vote. \nI don't know where those talking points came from. I have heard them in \ndifferent places. The Democratic leader was asked about that yesterday \nby the press in open session. He said it is absolutely not so. I am the \nranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Just as nobody from \nleadership has lobbied me on now-Chief Justice Roberts when I voted for \nhim, nobody has lobbied me on Judge Alito; nor have I lobbied anybody \nelse, and nor have I heard of anybody who has been lobbied.\n  What the distinguished senior Senator from Nevada, the Democratic \nleader, has said over and over again is that this is a vote of \nconscience. Every Senator has to search his or her own conscience. In \nfact, I was also concerned when the distinguished Republican leader \nopened the debate on this nomination by complaining that those opposing \nJudge Alito are smearing a decent and honorable man. Mr. President, \nagain, out of almost 300 million Americans, only 100 of us get a chance \nto say whether this man will go on the Supreme Court, where he can sit \nthere for years, decades even, and where he is supposed to be the \nultimate check and balance and guardian of our rights. To say that by \nopposing him is smearing him, that is not so.\n  Senator Specter and I held a fair and open hearing on him. Democrats \nhad substantive and probing questions to try to learn more about Judge \nAlito, and some Republicans did the same. These complaints about the \ntreatment of Judge Alito ring hollow after President Bush was forced by \nan extreme faction of his own Republican Party to withdraw his first \nchoice for the vacancy, Harriet Miers. It was a humiliation of the \nPresident by an extreme faction in his party. Within hours of the time \nhe nominated her, many groups on the far right criticized the \nnomination, and a number of Republican Senators raised serious concerns \ncalling for a thorough hearing and a probing inquiry in light of their \nconcerns about her record.\n  The same groups on the right immediately embraced Samuel Alito after \nthey had forced Harriet Miers to be withdrawn. The same Republican \nSenators who said they needed to learn more about Harriet Miers' \njudicial philosophy before they could vote to confirm her are now doing \nan about face and criticizing Democrats for saying they want to do the \nsame type of inquiry for Judge Alito. President Bush buckled to \npressure and withdrew the nomination for Harriet Miers because she \ndidn't pass the litmus test and because there were those who said they \nwere not sure how they would vote.\n  The third nomination--Judge Alito's--people applauded, implying that \nhere we have somebody who we know how he will vote, so he is fine.\n  Democratic Senators are taking their constitutional duties seriously. \nWe have a single fundamental question: Will the Senate serve its \nconstitutional role and preserve the Supreme Court as a constitutional \ncheck on the expansion of presidential power?\n  A nominee's views on Executive power and the checks and balances \nbuilt by the Founders into our constitutional framework should always \nweigh heavily in hearings for those nominated to the Supreme Court. \nExecutive power issues were the first issues I raised with Chief \nJustice Roberts at his confirmation hearing, and they were the first \nissues I raised with Judge Alito.\n  The reason presidential power issues have come to dominate this \nconfirmation process is that we have clearly arrived now at a crucial \njuncture in our Nation, and on our highest court, over the question of \nwhether a President of the United States is above the law. The Framers \nknew that unchecked power leads to abuses and corruption, and the \nSupreme Court is the ultimate check and balance in our system. Vibrant \nchecks and balances are instruments in protecting both the security and \nthe liberty of the American people.\n  This is a nomination that I fear threatens the fundamental rights and \nliberties of all Americans, now and for generations to come. One need \nonly look to the White House to see the practical effects of such an \nerosion of those rights and liberties. This President is prone to \nunilateralism and assertions of Executive power that extend all the way \nto illegal spying on Americans.\n  This President is in the midst of a radical realignment of the powers \nof the Government and its intrusiveness into the private lives of all \nAmericans, Republicans and Democrats. Frankly, this nomination is part \nof that plan for the intrusion into our private lives. I am concerned \nthat if we confirm this nominee, it will further erode checks and \nbalances that have protected our constitutional rights for more than \n200 years. It is not overstating the case to say this is a critical \nnomination. It is one that can tip the balance on the Supreme Court \nradically away from the constitutional checks and balances and the \nprotection of Americans' fundamental rights.\n  This past week, I introduced a resolution to clarify what we all \nknow, that the congressional authorization for the use of military \nforce against Osama bin Laden did not authorize warrantless spying on \nAmericans, as the administration has now claimed. I thought--we all \nthought--that when we as Democrats joined in the bipartisan \nauthorization of military action against Osama bin Laden more than 4 \nyears ago, our action would have been more effective and that we would \nhave by now succeeded in ridding the world of that terrorist leader. We \ngave the President all the authority he needed to go after Osama bin \nLaden, and we thought with the great power of this country he would \nhave gone out and caught him. He didn't. They averted our special \nforces out of Afghanistan and into Iraq before we even announced we \nwere going to go to war against Iraq. We lost the opportunity to catch \nOsama bin Laden, the man who did order the attacks on America.\n  Now we find the administration, instead of saying sorry we didn't \ncatch Osama bin Laden, even though you gave us the authority, we now \nwant to use that authority as legal justification for a covert, illegal \nspying program on Americans.\n  As Justice O'Connor underscored very recently, even war ``is not a \nblank check for the President when it comes to the rights of the \nNation's citizens.''\n  Now that the illegal spying on Americans has become public, the Bush \nadministration's lawyers are contending that Congress authorized it. \nThe September 2001 authorization to use military force did no such \nthing. It did not authorize illegal spying on Americans. Republican \nSenators know it, and some have been courageous to say so publicly. The \nfact is, we all know it. The liberties and rights that define us as \nAmericans and the system of checks and balances that serve to preserve \nthem should not be sacrificed to threats of terrorism or to the \nexpanding power of the Government. Security and liberty are not \nmutually exclusive values in America. We should have both, and we can \nhave both, so long as we have adequate checks and balances and with the \nextra effort it takes to chart the right course to preserve our \nliberties as we preserve our security.\n  We are constantly reminded of what Benjamin Franklin said: People who \ngive up their liberties for security deserve neither. The terrorists \nwin if they frighten us into sacrificing our\n\n[[Page S48]]\n\nfreedoms--something I said in the days following 9/11, and I believe it \njust as strongly today.\n  Just after 9/11, I joined with Republicans and Democrats--I was at \nthat time chairman of the Judiciary Committee, in round-the-clock \nefforts to update and adapt our law enforcement powers, and we did. The \nlaw became known as the USA PATRIOT Act. It is obvious they missed a \nlot of the signals that were out there. It is obvious they had ignored \nthe evidence that was before them that might have stopped the \nterrorists from striking us, but we didn't make those accusations, we \ndidn't say then--let's find out all the things you did wrong that \nallowed us to be hit on your watch. Instead, during those days, we \nasked the Bush administration, what do you need, tell us what you need \nso it doesn't happen again, whether it is on your watch or anybody \nelse's.\n  In answering that question, they never asked us to amend the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act to accommodate spying on Americans they \nnow say they will undertake, even though the law doesn't allow it. The \nlaw does contain an expressed reservation for the 15 days following a \ndeclaration of war. But neither Attorney General Ashcroft nor anyone \nelse in the Bush administration at that time or any time afterward \nsought congressional authorization for this illegal NSA spying program.\n  Actually, Attorney General Gonzales admitted in a recent press \nconference that the Bush administration did not seek legal \nauthorization for this kind of spying on Americans because ``it was not \nsomething we could likely get.'' We don't know; he never asked. But \nconsider that damning admission. It is utterly inconsistent with the \nBush administration's current argument that Congress authorized \nwarrantless spying on Americans, when they now are saying they didn't \nask for it because they couldn't get it. They can't have it both ways, \nalthough Lord knows they are trying as hard as they can to have it both \nways.\n  The Bush administration's after-the-fact claims about the breadth of \nthat 2001 resolution are the latest in a long line of manipulations and \nanother affront to the rule of law, American values, and traditions. We \nhave also seen such overreaching in the Justice Department's twisted \ninterpretation of the torture statute, in the detention of suspects \nwithout charges, the denial of access to counsel, and in the \nmisapplication of the material witness statute as a sort of general \npreventive detention law. Such abuses serve to harm our national \nsecurity as well as our civil liberties. In fact, sources at the FBI \nreportedly say that much of what was forwarded to them to investigate \nfrom the NSA spying program was worthless and led to dead ends. That is \na dangerous diversion of our investigative resources.\n  When they talk about thousands of al-Qaida conversations they have to \nmonitor going to Americans--thousands? Interesting. So how many people \nhave been arrested because of those thousands? Two thousand people? \nFifteen hundred people? One thousand? Five hundred? Four hundred? Three \nhundred? Thirteen? Seven? Five, three, four, two, one? Or none?\n  A central question, therefore, during the hearings of this nomination \nwas whether Judge Alito would serve as an effective constitutional \ncheck on the Presidency. Preventing Government intrusions into the \npersonal privacy and freedoms of Americans is one of the hallmarks of \nthe Supreme Court. They are not supposed to be in the pocket of any \nadministration. After all, this Senate, when it was overwhelmingly \nDemocrat, under Democratic control--one of the most popular Democrats \nin my lifetime was President Franklin Roosevelt. When he wanted to pack \nthe Supreme Court, when he wanted to manipulate the Court, it was the \nDemocrats who stood up and said no because they felt the Court should \nbe a check and balance. Here there is no assurance that Judge Alito \nwill serve as an effective check and balance on Government intrusions \ninto the lives of Americans. In fact, his record suggests otherwise.\n  We know that Samuel Alito sought to justify absolute immunity for \nPresident Nixon's Attorney General John Mitchell from lawsuits for \nwiretapping Americans, among other violations of their privacy. He was \nasking for immunity even if the Attorney General acted willfully to \nviolate people's rights. This is the man who is going to be a check and \nbalance on our rights?\n  We know that as a judge, Samuel Alito was willing to go further than \neven Michael Chertoff, the former head of the Ashcroft Justice \nDepartment's Criminal Division and the current Secretary of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, in excusing Government agents for \nsearches not authorized by judicial warrants. This is the man who is \ngoing to be a check and balance?\n  We know Judge Alito would have excused a strip search of a 10-year-\nold girl, even though the search warrant did not authorize this. This \nis a man who is going to be a check and balance?\n\n  In both Doe v. Groody and Baker v. Monroe Township, Judge Alito \ndissented and would have allowed invasive searches beyond the scope of \nwarrants. This is a man who is going to be there as a check and \nbalance?\n  I was a prosecutor for eight years, and I am keenly aware of the \ndifficulties faced by police officers in the course of their duties. I \nsupport vigorous law enforcement tools. But I am also mindful of the \ncareful balance that must be struck in order to preserve our individual \nliberties. One of the most important Fourth Amendment protections we \nhave for our privacy is the requirement that a judicial officer ensure \nthat the Government's intrusion on citizens' privacy is based on \nprobable cause and that it is reasonable. It is the judge who \ndetermines whether to authorize the search and the extent of the search \nto be permitted. The officer's affidavit and the warrant are not mirror \nimages of each other. The magistrate is not a rubber stamp. The role of \nthe magistrate in issuing warrants, a role Judge Alito has too easily \ncast aside on the bench, is a crucial check in maintaining the right \nbalance so that all Americans can have both security and liberty.\n  It is worth taking a few moments to recount the facts of these cases, \nbecause I am concerned that Judge Alito has too little regard for the \nconsequences arising from allowing these kinds of invasive searches \nbeyond those authorized by warrants.\n  In the Doe case, the 10-year-old girl and her mother were subjected \nto what the Third Circuit termed an ``intrusive'' strip search, even \nthough they were not suspected of nor charged with any wrongdoing. The \nwarrant that the Government agents had obtained from a judicial officer \nauthorized a search for a man living at a certain address. Yet when \nthey arrived at the address they encountered only the 10-year-old and \nher mother and proceeded to strip search them. There was no contention \nthat they posed a risk to the agents.\n  Similarly, in Baker v. Monroe Township, a mother and her three teen-\naged children were detained and searched as they arrived at the home of \nthe mother's adult son. The woman and her teen-aged children did not \nlive at the house, were not suspected of any wrongdoing, were not named \nin the warrant, and were not even inside the premises when the officers \narrived on the scene. They were nevertheless all ordered at gunpoint to \nlie on the ground. They were subsequently handcuffed, taken into the \nhouse, further detained, and their property and persons were searched.\n  In both cases, the Third Circuit held that the Government agents had \nacted inappropriately and had violated the Fourth Amendment when they \nconducted these invasive searches of innocent persons who were not \nnamed in the search warrants. When I asked him why he, in contrast, \nlooked beyond the ``four corners'' of the warrant that was actually \nsigned by the magistrate in Doe, Judge Alito replied that the issue was \na ``technical'' one. Repeatedly when pressed about this case, Judge \nAlito insisted that the issue was merely ``technical.''\n  The illegal strip search was not ``technical'' for the 10-year-old \ngirl. Then-Judge Chertoff understood that this issue is far from \ntechnical, but, rather, embedded in the core protections of our \nindividual privacy and dignity from governmental intrusion. In the \ncourt's opinion, rejecting the rationale of Judge Alito's dissent, \nJudge Chertoff wrote: ``This is not an arcane or legalistic \ndistinction, but a difference that goes to the heart of the \nconstitutional requirement that judges, and not police, authorize \nwarrants.''\n\n[[Page S49]]\n\n  Judge Alito tried to find ``technical'' ways to excuse the \nillegality. Judge Alito's dissent relied on the affidavit accompanying \nthe warrant. To the extent the affidavit had requested a search of \n``all occupants'' of the home, it did so based on a concern about \nconcealment of drugs by ``frequent visitors that purchase [drugs]'' or \nby ``persons who do not actually reside or own/rent the premises''--not \nby a 10-year-old girl living in the home. Judge Alito ignored this \nlanguage in the affidavit, in order to misconstrue the affidavit more \nbroadly and to then substitute it for the magistrate's warrant.\n  Judge Alito's rationale was that because the officers' initial \nrequest was broad, it could be assumed that the magistrate intended to \ngrant broader search authority than that set forth in the warrant. The \nSupreme Court had specifically rejected this type of reasoning in the \ncase of Ramirez v. Groh, which was decided a month before Judge Alito \ndissented in Doe. In Groh, the Supreme Court held a search warrant \ninvalid, citing the sharp distinction the law draws between what is \nauthorized in a warrant, and what was requested. Judge Alito went to \ngreat lengths in a futile and hyper-technical attempt to distinguish \nthe Supreme Court's decision in Groh.\n  Similarly, in Baker v. Monroe Township, Judge Alito saw the facts in \nthe light most favorable to the Government, rather than to the mother \nand her children. That is directly contrary to the standard that should \nbe used when reviewing an order granting summary judgment against a \nparty. In his dissent, Judge Alito found that although the warrant in \nquestion did not describe any persons to be searched, it nevertheless \nwas appropriate for officers to search and handcuff a mother and her \nthree teen-aged children as they approached a relative's home. Judge \nAlito stated in his dissent that even though the mother and her three \nchildren were not named in the warrant and there was no reason to \nsuspect them of any wrongdoing, ``to [his] mind'' the warrant had \nbeen intended to authorize a search of ``any persons found on the \npremises.'' Judge Alito went so far as to excuse the officers' failure \nto request or obtain a warrant permitting the search of persons on the \npremises as sloppiness.\n\n  The Third Circuit disagreed with Judge Alito, holding that because \nthe search warrant did not authorize the search, it was unlawful and in \nviolation of the Fourth Amendment. The other judges hearing the case \nfound fault with Judge Alito's willingness to look beyond the warrant \nto excuse the unauthorized and unlawful searches. In Baker, Judge Alito \ninserted himself into the case in an active attempt to excuse \nmisconduct when the warrant did not authorize the Government intrusion.\n  Unfortunately, Doe and Baker are not outliers in Judge Alito's \nrecord. As troubling as his dissents are in those two cases, they are \nonly part of a broader pattern of deference to the Government that \nshows far too little concern for individual liberties and rights, which \nfind their ultimate protection in the Supreme Court.\n  Judge Alito's record on the use of excessive force is also troubling. \nIt goes back at least as far as his time in the Meese Justice \nDepartment. I find particularly troubling a 1984 memorandum he wrote to \nthe Solicitor General regarding a case called Tennessee & Memphis \nPolice Department v. Garner. In a long memo in which he repeatedly \nwrote in the first person proclaiming his own beliefs, Samuel Alito \nargued that there were no constitutional problems with a police officer \nshooting and killing an unarmed teenager who was fleeing after \napparently stealing $10 from a home. A year later, the Supreme Court \nruled 6-3 against Judge Alito's position in that case and reiterated \nthe law against use of ``deadly force'' if a suspect presents no \ndanger. In contrast to Justice O'Connor's dissent on federalism \ngrounds, Samuel Alito's memo makes no mention of the human tragedy of \nthe events nor did he think the Constitution even applied since he \nargued that the unjustified shooting was not technically a ``seizure.'' \nMost troubling is Judge Alito's statement in his legal memo endorsing \n``the general principle that the state is justified in using whatever \nforce is necessary to enforce its laws.'' I fear that this deference to \nthe Government, which he has continued on the bench, makes him ill-\nsuited to be an effective check on the Government or protector of \nindividual liberties and rights.\n  The Supreme Court is the ultimate check and balance in our system. \nThe independence of the Court and its members is crucial to our \ndemocracy and way of life. The Senate should never be allowed to become \na rubberstamp, and neither should the Supreme Court.\n  And so we owe it to the American people of today, and the Americans \nof generations to come, to ask and answer several essential questions: \nCan this President, or any President, order illegal spying on \nAmericans? Can this President, or any President, authorize torture, in \ndefiance of our criminal statutes and our international agreements? Can \nthis President, or any President, defy our laws and Constitution to \nhold American citizens in custody indefinitely without any court \nreview? Can this President, or any President, choose which laws he will \nfollow and which he will not, by quietly writing a side statement when \nhe signs a bill into law? These are some of the most vital questions of \nour era, and these are among the most vital questions that confront the \nSenate in considering this nomination to our highest court. Judge \nAlito's record, and his responses--and his failure to adequately answer \nquestions about these issues--are deeply troubling.\n  No President should be allowed to pack the courts, and especially the \nSupreme Court, with nominees selected to enshrine presidential claims \nof government power. Our system was designed to ensure a balance and to \nprotect against overreaching by any branch.\n  A Democratic Senate stood up to one of the most popular and powerful \nDemocratic Presidents of all time when it rejected President Franklin \nRoosevelt's court packing scheme. The Senate should not be a rubber \nstamp to this President's effort to pack the court with those who would \ngive him unfettered leeway. I will not lend my support to an effort by \nthis President to move the Supreme Court and the law radically to the \nright and to remove the final check within our democracy.\n  I voted for President Reagan's nomination of Justice Sandra Day \nO'Connor, for President Reagan's nomination of Justice Anthony Kennedy, \nfor President Bush's nomination of Justice Souter, and for this \nPresident's recent nomination of Chief Justice Roberts. I cannot vote \nfor this nomination.\n  At a time when the President is seizing unprecedented power, the \nSupreme Court needs to act as a check and to provide balance. Based on \nthe hearing and his record, I have no confidence that Judge Alito would \nprovide that crucial check and balance.\n  I see the distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts in the \nChamber. I am prepared at this point to yield to the distinguished \nSenator and former chairman of the Judiciary Committee and one whose \nprotection of the civil liberties of all of us is unparalleled in the \nhistory of this body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague, the \nSenator from Vermont. Again, we do many important things in the \nJudiciary Committee, but none are more important than the selection of \nour Supreme Court Justices. I again thank the Senator from Vermont for \nhis leadership in ensuring we're going to have a fair, open, \nappropriate, and a prodding, probing hearing and for the leadership he \nprovides for our committee on so many different matters of importance \nto the American people.\n  The stakes in this nomination could not be higher. This is the vote \nof a generation. If confirmed, Judge Alito will have enormous impact on \nour basic rights and liberties for decades to come. After all, the \nSupreme Court is the guardian of our most cherished rights and \nfreedoms, and they are symbolized in the four eloquent words inscribed \nabove the entrance of the Supreme Court of the United States: ``Equal \njustice under law.''\n\n  Those words are meant to guarantee our courts will be an independent \ncheck on abuses of power by the other two branches of Government. They \nare a commitment that our courts will always be a place where the poor \nand the powerless can stand on equal footing with the wealthy and the \nprivileged.\n\n[[Page S50]]\n\nEach of us in the Senate has a constitutional duty to ensure that \nanyone confirmed to the Court will uphold that clear ideal.\n  Contrary to what a number of my Republican colleagues have argued, \nthe Senate's role is not limited to ensuring that the nominee is \nethical and possesses a certain level of legal skill and professional \nexperience. To end the inquiry there would be a shameful abdication of \nour historic responsibility. The selection of a Supreme Court Justice \nis of great importance to every man and woman in America because the \ndecisions rendered by the Court affect their lives every day. Because \nof the enormous authority a successful nominee to the High Court will \nhave for decades to come, it is the responsibility of the Senate to \ndetermine what constitutional values the nominee holds before he or she \nis confirmed.\n  Has the nominee learned the great lessons of our Nation's history? \nWill the nominee be fair and openminded or will his judgments be \ntainted by rigid ideology? Is he genuinely committed to the principles \nof equal justice under law?\n  The American people will have no second chance to decide whether this \nperson should be trusted with such awesome responsibility. As their \nrepresentatives, it is our responsibility to ask the tough questions \nand demand meaningful answers.\n  For the Senate to become a rubberstamp for the judicial nominees of \nany President would be a betrayal of our sworn duty to the American \npeople. Taking our responsibility seriously and doing the job we were \nsent here to do is not being partisan, as some Republicans have \ncharged. In fact, it is those Republicans who are being partisan by \ndefending a nominee's right to remain silent when Senators ask him \nhighly relevant questions about his constitutional values. To ask a \nnominee for a candid statement of his current belief about what a \nprovision of the Constitution means is not asking for a guarantee of \nhow he will rule in the future. It is every bit as appropriate as \nreading a Law Review article or a case he wrote last year or a speech \nhe gave as a judge.\n  Unfortunately, on issue after issue, instead of answering candidly, \nJudge Alito merely recited the existing law but never disclosed his \nview of major constitutional issues. That is a disservice to the \nAmerican people, and Senators on both sides of the aisle should find \nhis evasiveness unacceptable. The confirmation process should not be \nreduced to a game of hide the ball. The stakes for our country are too \nhigh.\n  One of the most important of all responsibilities of the Supreme \nCourt is to enforce constitutional limitations on Presidential power. A \nJustice must have the courage and the wisdom to speak truth to power, \nto tell even the President he has gone too far. Chief Justice John \nMarshall was that kind of Justice when he told President Jefferson he \nhad exceeded his war-making powers under the Constitution. Justice \nRobert Jackson was that kind of Justice when he told President Truman \nhe could not misuse the Korean war as an excuse to take over the \nNation's steel mills. Chief Justice Warren Burger was that kind of \nJustice when he told President Nixon to turn over the White House tapes \non Watergate. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was that kind of Justice when \nshe told President Bush that ``a state of war is not a blank check for \nthe President when it comes to the rights of the Nation's citizens.''\n  We need that kind of Justice on the Court more than ever. It is our \nduty to ensure that only that kind of Justice is confirmed.\n  Today, we have a President who believes torture can be an acceptable \npractice despite laws and treaties that explicitly prohibit it. We have \na President who claims the power to arrest American citizens on \nAmerican soil and jail them for years without access to counsel or the \ncourts. We have a President who claims he has the authority to spy on \nAmericans without the court order required by law.\n  The record demonstrates we cannot count on Judge Alito to blow the \nwhistle when the President is out of bounds. He is a longstanding \nadvocate of expanding Executive power even at the expense of core \nindividual liberties.\n  One thing is clear: Judge Alito's view of the balance of powers is \ninconsistent with the Supreme Court's historic role of enforcing \nconstitutional limits on Presidential power.\n  His consistent advocacy of what he calls the gospel of the unitary \nexecutive is troubling. As Steven Calabresi, one of the originators of \nthe unitary executive theory, has said, ``The practical consequence of \nthis theory is dramatic: It renders unconstitutional independent \nagencies and counsels to the extent that they exercise discretionary \nexecutive power.''\n  But this bizarre theory goes much further. Its supporters concede \nthat without the unitary executive as a foundation, the Bush \nadministration cannot even hope to justify its constitutional abuses in \nthe name of fighting terrorism.\n  Judge Alito refused to discuss his current view of the constitutional \nlimits on Presidential power. But in a speech Judge Alito gave in 2004 \nto the Federalist Society, he stated that he believed ``the theory of \nthe unitary executive best captures the meaning of the Constitution's \ntext and structure.'' Under this radical view, all current independent \nagencies would be subject to the President's control. This would \ndestroy the independence of agencies such as the Federal Election \nCommission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission, and the Federal Reserve Board.\n  He strongly criticized the Supreme Court's ruling rejecting the \ntheory of unitary executive and outlined a strategy for bypassing it.\n  When Judge Alito made that speech, he had already been serving as \nappellate judge for 10 years, and he was describing his own view of the \nConstitution.\n  Similarly, Judge Alito had written earlier that ``the President's \nunderstanding of a bill should be just as important as that of \nCongress,'' and that Presidents should issue signing statements \nannouncing their own legal interpretations in the hope of influencing \nthe way the courts would construe the law.\n  On Executive power, ``Protective of the Executive Branch, the \nissuance of interpretative signing statements would have two chief \nadvantages. First, it would increase the power of the executive to \nshape the law.''\n  This is his view. But as Justice Hugo Black wrote in the steel \nseizure case, ``the President's power to see that the laws are \nfaithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker. The \nConstitution limits his functions in the lawmaking process to the \nrecommending of laws he thinks wise and the vetoing of laws he thinks \nbad.''\n  This is not just a theoretical case. As we all now know, President \nBush issued such signing statements on a bill that contained Senator \nMcCain's ban on torture. In that statement, the President reserved the \nright to ignore the McCain requirements and even asserted that in \ncertain circumstances his actions are beyond the reach of the courts.\n  I think many of us remember that meeting Senator McCain had with the \nPresident down in the White House, and the Senator from Arizona thanked \nthe President for working out the language that would be included in \nthe Defense appropriations bill and the President thanked him for his \nhelp and assistance in working that out. They both shook hands. This \npicture was on all three networks that night.\n  Four or five days later, the President signed the bill, and he issued \nan executive signing statement that said he continued to retain all of \nhis constitutional power, and that he was effectively taking any \nquestion of his Executive power out of the hands of any courts in this \ncountry. That is a complete reversal to what was agreed to, a complete \nreversal to what was said, a complete reversal to the understanding of \nthe Senator from Arizona. The Senator from Arizona has spoken about it. \nThat is Executive power.\n\n  We learned in high school there are two branches of Government, the \nHouse and the Senate. They pass the law, the President signs it. It is \nthe law. If he vetoes it, it is not the law. That is not Judge Alito's \nview. He believes the President, by signing it, has an independent \nvoice and that voice is a voice that should be listened to and heard, a \nvery bizarre view of Executive authority and Executive power.\n  In cases involving claims of privacy and freedom from unjustified \nsearches\n\n[[Page S51]]\n\nand seizures under the Bill of Rights, Judge Alito has consistently \ndeferred to the Government at the expense of core individual rights. In \nthe Doe v. Groody case, Judge Alito issued a dissent defending the \nstrip search of a 10-year-old girl without authorization from a \nwarrant. In his majority opinion, Michael Chertoff, former head of the \ncriminal division in the Department of Justice, who is now President \nBush's Secretary for Homeland Security, sharply criticized Judge \nAlito's view as threatening to turn the requirement of a search warrant \ninto little more than a rubberstamp. This is not Democrats saying this; \nthis is President Bush's Secretary of Homeland Security saying this. He \nwas a judge on that circuit, criticizing this kind of action, extension \nof a search warrant, because of the inclusion of some kind of other \ndocument into the search warrant. We understand what Michael Chertoff \nwas saying, and Judge Alito issued the dissent.\n  In Mellott v. Heemer, Judge Alito reported it was reasonable for \nmarshals to pump a sawed-off shotgun at a family sitting in their \nliving room. The family committed no crime. Seven marshals had detained \nand terrorized a family and friends, ransacked their home while \ncarrying out an unresisted civil eviction. Yet Judge Alito's decision \nmeant the family never got a trial before a jury of their peers.\n  Judge Alito's record in cases involving civil and individual rights \nshows a judge who repeatedly rules against individuals seeking justices \nfor wrongs by the powerful. In Bray v. Marriott Hotels, a hotel worker \nclaimed she was denied a promotion because she was an African American. \nThe Third Circuit held she was entitled to a trial because the employer \nfalsely stated she was unqualified and had evaluated her qualifications \ndifferently compared to White applicants. Judge Alito would have denied \nher the chance to prove her case. His colleagues on the court--not the \nDemocrats on the committee--his colleagues on the court wrote that his \ndissent would have eviscerated key provisions of the landmark Civil \nRights Act of 1964.\n  His record in other areas of civil rights is also troubling. In the \ncase in which a disabled person sought physical access to a medical \nschool under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the court's majority wrote \nthat few, if any, Rehabilitation Act cases would survive if Judge \nAlito's view prevailed. That is the majority, not Members of the \nDemocratic Party. That is the majority of the court members, looking at \nhis view.\n  There it is--issues on race, issues on disability, individual rights \nand liberties, those individuals, farmers, and others in a home \ninvolving a civil action, who committed no crime, where marshals used \ngestapo-like tactics. They were denied an opportunity for a court to \ngive a hearing. Judge Alito said no. That is why many Members wonder \nwhat kind of an opportunity the average American is going to have.\n  Does Judge Alito tip more to the powerful and the entrenched \ninterests and the Executive authority? Does he give those individuals--\nwomen, minorities, disabled workers--a fair shake?\n  Judge Alito said, let's look at the record. We have looked at the \nrecord. We looked at primarily the dissents, as pointed out in the \nprevious discussions.\n  Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who is considered to be a more progressive \nfigure on the Court, Judge Bork, a conservative figure who was proposed \nfor the court, agreed 91 percent of the time. It is in the dissent that \nwe understand whether an individual and individual rights are \nprotected. Those are the indicators. As we have seen from studies--not \njust from the members of the Judiciary Committee but by independent \nsources--Knight Ridder, Yale Law School Study Group, even the \nWashington Post, Cass Sunstein, a distinguished authority and \nthoughtful individual about constitutional law--all have reached a very \nsimilar conclusion that I have outlined here. We will hear on the other \nside: Well, they are only finding a few cases. We have suggested and \nincluded in the record of the Judiciary Committee this happens to be \nthe prevailing position of the nominee.\n  In another case, a jury ruled a woman had provided enough evidence to \nshow that she had wrongly lost her job because of sex discrimination. \nTen members of the Third Circuit who heard the case on appeal agreed. \nOnly Judge Alito argued that she had not provided adequate proof of \ndiscrimination. Who is out of step? Who is out of step? Who is out of \nthe mainstream?\n  In the Riley v. Taylor case, Judge Alito dissented from a ruling \nprohibiting the removal of African-American jurors because of their \nrace. It is unbelievable in today's America, in a case involving a \nminority defendant, that he was willing to ignore the overwhelming \nevidence that the Government insisted on an all-White jury for a Black \ndefendant. He found no problem with that and with their inclusion for \nthe death penalty. Eventually, that case was overturned, as it should \nhave been. What was going on in the mind? We talk of equal justice \nunder law. We see what has happened to individuals. We see what has \nhappened in this extremely important judicial proceeding.\n  Many of Judge Alito's other decisions demonstrate a similar tendency \nagainst the individual. In Rouse v. Plantier, a group of diabetic \ninmates sued prison officials for being deliberately insensitive to \nmedical needs. The trial court held there was enough evidence for the \njury to decide whether the inmates' constitutional rights had been \nviolated. Judge Alito refused to allow the jury to decide whether the \nGovernment was responsible for a broad systematic failure to provide \nthe necessary medical group. These inmates had diabetes. We know the \ndangers of diabetes. One out of four of our Medicare dollars is spent \non diabetes. One out of 10 of all health dollars is spent on diabetes. \nIt can be devastating, leading to blindness, or the losing of a limb, \nmore often the leg. They need attention and treatment.\n  This is a serious problem that is increasing in our society. There \nwas a systematic failure in terms of providing for that. They thought \nit should go to the jury. Was it or was it not a factual issue? The \nlower court said they ought to be able to go, but not Judge Alito. He \nreached a different conclusion.\n  In case after case, Judge Alito's decisions demonstrate a systematic \ntilt toward powerful institutions and against individuals attempting to \nvindicate their rights. He cites instances where he has decided for the \nlittle guy, but they are few and far between. We have an independent \nduty to evaluate Supreme Court nominees to determine whether their \nconfirmation is in the best interests of our Nation. That is the test. \nIt is a test with which Judge Alito himself seems to agree. He said we \nshould look at his record and decide whether he should be confirmed. I \nhave done so. I have compared the challenges the Court will face in the \nfuture with Judge Alito's record and I cannot support his nomination.\n  In this new century, the Court will undoubtedly consider sweeping new \nclaims to expand Executive power at the expense of core individual \nrights, including detention of Americans on American soil without \naccess to counsel or the court, and eavesdropping on Americans in \nviolation of Federal law.\n\n  The Court will decide new issues in America's struggle against \nprejudice and discrimination. It must remain a fair and impartial \ndecisionmaker for ordinary Americans seeking justice.\n  Justice Alito's record shows he should not be entrusted with these \nvital decisions facing our Nation's Court, and I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in opposing Judge Alito's nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleague from the \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts for his statement.\n  Those who are following this debate--my colleagues and those in the \naudience--should know this is a historic moment in the Senate. It is \nrare that Members of the Senate are given an opportunity to review a \nJustice to the Supreme Court. It has been 11 years. Recently, we have \nhad two. Chief Justice John Roberts came before the Senate, and today \nwe consider the nomination of Judge Sam Alito to fill the vacancy of \nSandra Day O'Connor on the Supreme Court.\n  I take this very seriously. As Senator Kennedy said yesterday in \nanother meeting: Next to a vote on war, there is nothing more serious \nthan this decision. The man or woman whom we choose to serve on the \nSupreme Court\n\n[[Page S52]]\n\nis there for the rest of their natural life. For 10, 20, or 30 years, \nthat person will be making critical decisions on the highest Court in \nthe land, the Court which is the refuge for our freedoms and our \nliberties.\n  That Court, across the street from this Capitol Building, has made \nmomentous and historic decisions which have literally changed America. \nIn the 1950s, nine members of the Supreme Court made the decision that \nwe would no longer have segregated public education in America. It was \nnot the leadership of a President or the Congress, but it was the \nCourt.\n  Similarly, that same Court, in the 1960s, established a new right \nunder our Constitution, a word which you cannot find within the \nconfines of that document, the right of privacy. That Court--nine \nJustices across the street--said that when it came to the most personal \nand basic decisions in our lives, they were reserved to us as \nindividuals, not to the Government. That was not a finding by a \nPresident. It was not a law passed by Congress. It was a decision of \nthe Supreme Court.\n  And time and again, whether we are speaking of the rights of \nminorities in America, women in America, those who are disabled, that \nCourt and the nine Justices who sit on the bench make decisions which \nchange America for generations to come. That is why the selection of a \nnominee to the Supreme Court is so important and so historic. It is \nmade even more so by the fact that the vacancy we are filling on the \nSupreme Court is not another run-of-the-mill vacancy, it is the vacancy \nof Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman ever appointed to the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  As important as her gender is, the fact is, she brought unique \nleadership to the Court. You see, over the last 10 years, there have \nbeen 193 decisions in that Court that were decided 5 to 4. One \nJustice's vote made the difference. If one Justice had voted the other \nway, the decision would have been the opposite--193 times in 10 years. \nAnd in 148 of 193 cases, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was the deciding \nvote.\n  So we are not only faced with a historic and constitutional challenge \nin filling this vacancy, we have a special responsibility because the \nvacancy that is being filled is a vacancy that will tip the scales of \njustice in America one way or the other way.\n  What kind of cases did Sandra Day O'Connor provide the decisive vote \non? Cases which safeguarded Americans' right to privacy in the area of \nreproductive freedom, the rights of women; cases that required \ncourtrooms to be accessible to people with disabilities, decided 5 to \n4; preserving the rights of universities to use affirmative action \nprograms, decided 5 to 4; affirming the right of State legislatures to \nprotect the voting rights of minorities in America, decided 5 to 4; \nupholding State laws giving individuals the right to a second doctor's \nopinion if their HMO denied them treatment, decided 5 to 4; reaffirming \nthe Federal Government's authority to protect the environment that we \nlive in, a 5-to-4 case; and reaffirming America's time-honored \nprinciple of the separation of church and State, 5 to 4.\n\n  In every single case, the fifth vote was Sandra Day O'Connor. And now \nshe leaves, after many years of service to America, with an \nextraordinary record of public service. Many of us are listening, \nwatching, and reading to make certain the person replacing her can rise \nto the challenge, and not only the challenge of serving in the Court \nbut the challenge of fighting for the same values she fought for. \nSandra Day O'Connor came to the Supreme Court with the support of Barry \nGoldwater, the preeminent conservative in American politics in the \n1960s and beyond. Many expected her to be of the same stripe, that she \nwould follow his basic philosophy. In many ways, she did because if you \nmeasure Barry Goldwater's contribution to American politics, you will \nfind him starting in a very conservative position and, over the years, \nmoving to a more libertarian position, a position that valued personal \nfreedom more.\n  The same thing happened to Sandra Day O'Connor. Starting as a \nconservative, over the years she moved toward a more libertarian \nposition, a position which, in many instances, was critical for \nprotecting our basic rights.\n  It has been said she was the most important woman in America. And it \nis easy to see why. Time and again, Sandra Day O'Connor was the crucial \nfifth vote on civil rights, human rights, women's rights, and workers' \nrights. That is why we have looked so closely and so carefully at Judge \nSam Alito.\n  And there is more. His was not the first name to be suggested by the \nPresident for this vacancy. The first name was the President's personal \nattorney in the White House, Harriet Miers, a person he obviously \nrespects very much. Do you recall what happened to her nomination? Her \nname was brought forward, and there was a firestorm of criticism about \nHarriet Miers' nomination. Did it come from the Democrats? Did it come \nfrom liberals? No. It came from the other side. Time and again, the \nmost rightwing on the American political scene said Harriet Miers was \nnot acceptable, and they raised questions about whether she could be \ntrusted to be on the Supreme Court to advance their rightwing agenda.\n  Their opposition to her nomination grew to a level and reached a \npoint people did not think would happen. President Bush withdrew \nHarriet Miers' name as a nominee. In the wake of withdrawing Harriet \nMiers' name, in sailed Judge Sam Alito--not the best circumstance for \nsomeone who is coming to this position arguing they have no political \nagenda.\n  Well, we looked carefully to see what the same rightwing \norganizations would say about Sam Alito. They had rejected Harriet \nMiers. They gave Harriet Miers the back of a hand. They gave Sam Alito \ntheir blessing. They said: He is fine. We support him. He is the right \nperson for the job.\n  Now, does that raise a question in your mind as to whether Judge \nAlito will come to this position without an agenda, without professing \nsome allegiance to extreme views these organizations hold? Will it \nraise the question in the minds of many of us?\n  And then, during the course of his nomination, there emerged a \ndocument, a document he had personally written. In 1985, Sam Alito \nwrote a document to the Justice Department of the Reagan \nadministration, then headed by Attorney General Ed Meese, looking for a \njob. In the course of that document he was supposed to lay out why he, \nSam Alito, was in step with the Reagan administration's thinking and \nphilosophy. And, in 1985, that memo was explicit. It went through page \nafter page of the things he felt qualified him to serve in that \nadministration.\n  Some have said: Wait a minute, that was 20 years ago. People change. \nAnd it is true. I have changed my positions on some issues. It is well \nknown and documented. It happens. But to say it was a document given \nwithout conviction overlooks the obvious. Sam Alito, at that moment in \n1985, was 10 years out of Yale Law School. He had served in the \nmilitary. He served a year as a clerk to a Federal judge. He had served \n4 years as an assistant U.S. attorney, prosecuting cases, and 4 years \nas an assistant to the Solicitor General of the United States.\n  So rather than suggesting that document reflected the casual \nobservations of someone looking for a job at a very early age, I think \nthat document told us much more.\n  What it told us was that he questioned some very fundamental things \nabout law in America. In his essay, he wrote that ``the Constitution \ndoes not protect a right to an abortion.'' He said he was proud of his \nwork in the Justice Department, fighting abortion rights and \naffirmative action. He wrote that he was skeptical of Warren court \ndecisions which embraced the principle of ``one person, one vote'' and \nthe separation of church and state. And he pointed with pride to his \nmembership in two very conservative organizations: The Federalist \nSociety and the Concerned Alumni of Princeton.\n  His listing of the Concerned Alumni of Princeton, of which he was a \ngraduate, was troubling because that organization was once dedicated to \nestablishing a quota at Princeton that each year they would accept no \nfewer than 800 men, and the Concerned Alumni of Princeton wanted to \nstop what they considered to be the infiltration of the Princeton \nstudent body by women and minorities. Some of the things they wrote and \nsaid were outrageous. In fairness, Judge Alito at the hearing\n\n[[Page S53]]\n\nsaid he would not associate himself with their remarks, but it is \ninteresting that he would identify this organization as one of his \nmemberships that would qualify him to serve in the Justice Department.\n  As an examination of Judge Alito's 15-year track record on the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals evidences, there are other elements that suggest a \nvery conservative judge. University of Chicago law professor Cass \nSunstein examined his dissenting opinions over 15 years and concluded:\n\n       When they touch on issues that split people along political \n     lines, Alito's dissents show a remarkable pattern: They are \n     almost uniformly conservative.\n\n  People say to me: If he was found ``well qualified'' by the American \nBar Association, what is wrong with that? Why don't you just go ahead \nand approve the man? The bar association is an important part of this \nprocess, but they only look to three main things. They look to whether \nhe has legal skills. That is important. They look to whether he is an \nhonest person. That is equally important. And they look to his \ntemperament. They said he is well qualified by those three standards. \nBut the American Bar Association doesn't look to his values. It doesn't \nlook to his philosophy, how he is likely to rule in critical cases for \nAmerica.\n  I wanted to ask Judge Alito at the hearing: Where is your heart? What \ndo you feel about the power you will have as a Supreme Court Justice? I \nasked him an obvious question in the lead-up to my inquiry: I asked if \nhe was a fan of Bruce Springsteen. You might wonder why that would come \nup in this case. Judge Alito is from New Jersey, as is Bruce \nSpringsteen. He said to me in his answer:\n\n       I am--to some degree.\n\n  That is a qualified answer, but I took it and went on. The reason I \nraised it was this: Many people have asked Bruce Springsteen, Where do \nyou come up with the stories in your songs? How do you talk about all \nthese people who are struggling in America? He answered:\n\n       I have a familiarity with the crushing hand of fate.\n\n  The reason I asked that question was to go to some specific cases \nJudge Alito had decided and ask him about the crushing hand of fate. \nSenator Kennedy just mentioned one of them.\n  An African American, charged with murder, facing the possibility of \nthe death penalty, argues on appeal that his verdict was unfair because \nthe prosecutor went out of his way to exclude every African American \nfrom the jury so that it was an all-White jury judging a Black man. He \npresented his evidence that in three other murder trials, one involving \nan African American, the other two White defendants, the prosecutor had \ndone the same thing--kept the Blacks off the jury systematically. The \nThird Circuit Court on which Judge Alito served said that defendant was \nright; that is not something we accept in America; we are going to send \nthis case back to be retried by a jury of this defendant's peers. They \nsaw the importance of a justice system that is blind to race.\n  But not Judge Alito. He said establishing the fact that four murder \ntrials came before the same prosecutor with all White juries is like \nestablishing that five out of six of the last Presidents were left \nhanded. I thought that was a rather casual dismissal of an important \ncase and an important principle. When I asked Judge Alito about it, he \nseemed more committed to the principles of statistics than the \nprinciples of racial justice which the majority in his court applied.\n  Another case involved an individual who was the subject of harassment \nin the workplace. This person had been assaulted by fellow employees. \nHe was a mentally retarded individual. He was so brutally assaulted in \na physical manner that I did not read into the record of the hearing, \nnor will I today, the details. Trust me, they are gruesome and grisly. \nHis case was dismissed by a trial court, and it came before Judge Alito \nto decide whether to give him a chance to take his case to a jury. \nJudge Alito said no, the man should not have a day in court. Why? Not \nbecause he didn't have a case to argue, but Judge Alito believed that \nhis attorney had written a poorly prepared legal document before his \ncourt. Was there justice in that decision? Did the crushing hand of \nfate come down on an individual who was looking for a day in court who \nhappened to have an attorney without the appropriate skills?\n  When it came to health and safety questions involving coal mines, a \ntopic we see in the news every day, Judge Alito was the sole dissenter \nin a case as to whether a coal mining operation would be subject to \nFederal mine and safety inspection. He argued in the committee hearing \nthat he just read the law a little differently.\n\n  What we find in all these cases is a consistent pattern. Time and \nagain, it is the poor person, the dispossessed person, the one who is \npowerless who has finally made it to his court, who is shown the door. \nThat troubles me. It troubles me because what we are looking for in a \nJustice is wisdom.\n  If you are a student of the Bible--and I am not--you know this: The \nperson who embodies the virtue of wisdom was a man named Solomon. In \nthe Bible, the Lord came to Solomon and said: I will give you a gift. \nWhat gift would you have? And Solomon said: I want a caring heart. He \ndidn't ask for riches or knowledge; he asked for a caring heart. This \nwise man wanted that as part of who he was.\n  That is what I looked for with Judge Alito. Sadly, in case after \ncase, I couldn't find it. I worry that if Judge Alito goes to the \nHighest Court in the land for a lifetime appointment, he will tip the \nbalance of the scales of justice. He will tip the balance against \nprotecting our basic privacy and personal freedoms. He will tip the \nbalance in favor of Presidential power, even when it violates the law. \nHe will tip the balance when it comes to recognizing the rights of the \npowerful over the powerless. He will tip the balance on workers' rights \nand civil rights and human rights and women's rights and protecting the \nenvironment. That is why I cannot support his nomination.\n  I call on the President to send to us a conservative like Sandra Day \nO'Connor. She was a woman who demonstrated, in a lifetime of service, \nthat she understands the values of this country and committed her life \nto protecting them. I am sorry that Judge Sam Alito does not live up to \nher standard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, before I make the remarks I have \nprepared about Judge Alito, I extend my gratitude to members of my \nstaff who, as a member of the Judiciary Committee, have been so \ninstrumental in my ability to prepare for this confirmation process.\n  In particular, I note the contribution of Brian Fitzpatrick, who has \nbeen a member of my staff and worked on both the Roberts and Alito \nSupreme Court nominations. He is leaving next week after Judge Alito is \nconfirmed to the U.S. Supreme Court, as he will be, to go teach at NYU, \nNew York University. NYU's gain is our loss. I certainly wish Brian \nwell in his new career. I put him on notice that the next vacancy that \nPresident Bush gets to the U.S. Supreme Court, I am going to be calling \nhim and asking him to come back for another gig.\n  Madam President, I rise today to explain why I intend to vote to \nconfirm Judge Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court. Those who were just \nlistening to the eloquent words of the distinguished Democratic whip \nmight wonder how in the world anybody could ever vote for this nominee; \nhow Judge Alito survived for the last 15 years serving as a member of \nthe circuit court of appeals in Philadelphia without getting impeached; \nhow in the world his former law clerks, the people who have worked most \nclosely with the judge, and who happened to be Democrats and have a \ndifferent political view, a different world view, a different agenda, \ncould come in as they did before the Senate Judiciary Committee and \nextol the qualifications and temperament of this fine public servant \nand this fine human being; or how, possibly, in listening to the \ncriticisms we have heard of this nominee and of the President for \nhaving the temerity to nominate him, you can reconcile that impression \nwith the fact that we heard on the Senate Judiciary Committee virtually \nall of the current and former members of the Third Circuit Court of \nAppeals who have worked closely with Judge Alito day in and day out, \nwho to a person\n\n[[Page S54]]\n\ncame in and said this is exactly the kind of judge we would want and we \nthink the American people would have a right to expect, and urged us to \nfavorably vote on his confirmation.\n  It is clear to me, though, during the course of the confirmation \nprocess, that the reason I support Judge Alito his philosophy of \njudicial restraint is exactly the reason his detractors oppose his \nnomination. The sad fact is that there are some in this country who \ndon't want judges who respect the legislative choices made by the \nAmerican people. Rather, they want judges who will substitute their own \npersonal ideological or political agenda for those choices made in the \nHalls of Congress by the elected representatives of the American \npeople.\n  There are some in this country who have views that are so out of the \nmainstream that they don't have any chance to persuade the American \npeople to accept them. For example, there are some who want to end \ntraditional marriage between one man and one woman. There are some who \nwant to continue the barbaric practice of partial-birth abortion. Some \neven want to abolish the Pledge of Allegiance. But they know if they \nbrought some of those issues to the floor of the Senate and to the \nfloor of the U.S. House of Representatives, these are not the views \nthat would be expressed through the elected representatives of the \nAmerican people because the American people themselves don't agree with \nthese far left, out-of-the-mainstream views.\n  For these advocates of these out-of-the-mainstream views, the only \nway they will ever see their views enacted into law is to circumvent \nthe American people and pack the courts with judges who will impose \ntheir agenda on the American people. They believe in judicial activism \nbecause judicial activism is all they have.\n  Of course, Judge Alito's detractors will never say they believe in \njudicial activism. They know the American people don't favor it. They \nknow the American people believe fervently in democracy and self-\ndetermination, and they don't want unelected judges making the laws of \nthis country. So Judge Alito's detractors are forced to oppose his \nnomination on the basis of certain pretexts. They are forced to grasp \nfor any means they can to try to defeat his nomination. As one of Judge \nAlito's detractors put it, ``you name it, we will do it'' to defeat \nJudge Alito.\n  One of their favorite pretexts--and we have heard some of it this \nmorning--is that Judge Alito embraces this view of an omnipotent \nexecutive branch; that he believes the President's powers are without \nlimitation. This pretext is a complete canard. It is based on the claim \nthat Judge Alito once endorsed an academic theory called the unitary \nexecutive. But a unitary executive is not the same as an all-powerful \nexecutive. It is, after all, a theory that says there are three coequal \nbranches of Government--executive, legislative, and judicial. And each \nofficial within that each branch is accountable to the people for the \npower they exercise and is delegated to them by the Constitution and \nlaws of the country.\n  But to show how misplaced this criticism is, according to Judge \nAlito's opponents, the father of the unitary executive theory is \nJustice Scalia on the U.S. Supreme Court. The problem they have is that \nthe facts show that Justice Scalia does not favor an all-powerful \nPresident. No one does. We know this in particular from the decision he \nwrote in the Hamdi case 2 years ago. This was a case where the \ndetention status of some of the terrorists who are kept at Guantanamo \nBay was being reviewed by the Supreme Court. In that case, in the \nopinion written by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the Supreme Court held \nthat the President had the power as Commander in Chief, during a time \nof war, to indefinitely detain even American citizens who were \nsuspected of terrorism without filing criminal charges against them. \nJustice Scalia, perhaps one of the most conservative members of the \nCourt, dissented from that, saying the President had no such power; \nthat it was unconstitutional for him to do so. His views did not carry \nthe day, but indeed of all of the Justices, Justice Scalia, the father \nof this unitary executive theory, was least deferential to the powers \nof the President. Judge Alito doesn't believe the President's powers \nare unlimited any more than Justice Scalia does.\n  Now, one of the witnesses we had during the course of the hearing--I \nmentioned several former and current members of the Third Circuit Court \nof Appeals. One of them who testified interestingly and relevant to the \npoint was Judge John Gibbons who has since left the judiciary and has a \nlaw practice where he represents the detainees at Guantanamo Bay. He \nsaid:\n\n       The committee members should not think for a moment that I \n     support Judge Alito's nomination because I am a dedicated \n     defender of the Bush administration. On the contrary, I and \n     my firm have been litigating with that administration over \n     its treatment of detainees held at Guantanamo Bay.\n\n  He said:\n\n       I am confident that as an able legal scholar and a fair-\n     minded justice, Judge Alito will give the arguments, legal \n     and factual, that may be presented on behalf of our clients \n     careful and thoughtful consideration, without any \n     predisposition in favor of the position of the executive \n     branch.\n\n  That is another example of how those who know this man best simply \nbelieve that he will be a fair-minded judge and he will not be unduly \ndeferential to the President, the executive branch, or anyone else for \nthat matter, and that he will faithfully discharge his responsibilities \nunder the Constitution and laws.\n  Another favorite pretext of the opponents of this nomination is that \nas a replacement for Justice O'Connor, this nominee, Judge Alito, will \nshift the Supreme Court radically to the right. But in order to believe \nthis or support this supposed theory, they have to radically rewrite \nhistory. It requires them to paint Justice O'Connor as some sort of \nliberal.\n  But the truth is far different. For example, according to the Harvard \nLaw Review, over the last decade, the Justice on the Court with whom \nJustice O'Connor agreed most frequently--over 80 percent of the time--\nwas former Chief Justice William Rehnquist.\n  I think we will all acknowledge that Chief Justice Rehnquist was no \nliberal. Yet Sandra Day O'Connor and Chief Justice William Rehnquist \nagreed with each other more than 80 percent of the time.\n  Indeed, in subject matter after subject matter, Justice O'Connor sees \neye to eye with what Judge Alito has demonstrated on the bench and said \nhow he will approach his job on the Supreme Court. Both believe in \nfederalism, that Congress is not above the law and its powers are not \nunlimited but, rather, they are, under the Constitution, limited and \nenumerated, and that some powers are still reserved to the States and \nthe people.\n  That is not an out-of-the-mainstream view. Justice O'Connor shares \nthat view. The Founders of this country shared that view, and I believe \nthe American people believe that the people have retained some rights \nand the States have retained some rights against an all-powerful \nFederal Government. Judge Alito happens to believe that as well.\n  Justice O'Connor and Judge Alito both struck down some affirmative \naction programs that resulted in reverse discrimination based on strict \nnumerical quotas. And yes, both have even criticized Roe v. Wade. The \ntruth is that if Justice O'Connor were the nominee today, she would \nmeet with just as much opposition as Judge Alito has. The confirmation \nprocess has simply become a no-win situation.\n  Another favorite pretext of the opponents of this nominee is that he \nis somehow biased against the mythical little guy. That he always rules \nagainst the little guy in favor of the big guy. The basis for this \npretext is a litany of cases his opponents cite where Judge Alito has \nsided against a sympathetic plaintiff. This pretext suffers from a \nnumber of flaws.\n  The first flaw is a selective reading of Judge Alito's record. Judge \nAlito has been a judge for 15 years. He has decided plenty of cases in \nfavor of consumers, medical malpractice victims, employment \ndiscrimination victims, and other plaintiffs. In other words, he has \ndecided plenty of cases for the little guy. But his opponents ignore \nall of these cases and focus only on the cases where he has decided \nagainst a sympathetic plaintiff. Anyone who has looked at his entire \nrecord has found the claim of bias to be completely without merit, \nindeed, including the Washington Post. The Washington Post did an \nanalysis of\n\n[[Page S55]]\n\nJudge Alito's entire record and found he is no more likely than the \naverage appeals court judge to rule for businesses, for example, over \nindividuals. And, yes, I said the Washington Post and not the Wall \nStreet Journal.\n  Moreover, any notion that Judge Alito has a special bias against \nvictims of racial discrimination is as false as it is demeaning. The \npeople who know Judge Alito best testified at length that he applies \nthe law in a fair and evenhanded manner without fear or favor. Indeed, \nperhaps most instructive is the evidence from the late Judge Leon \nHigginbotham. He has passed on, but his comments are part of the \nrecord.\n  Judge Higginbotham was something of a civil rights hero, as many \npeople know. He was president of the Philadelphia chapter of the NAACP, \nwas awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and was appointed to the \nU.S. Civil Rights Commission by President Clinton. This is what he had \nto say about Judge Alito:\n\n       Sam Alito is my favorite judge to sit with on this court. \n     He is a wonderful judge and a terrific human being. Sam Alito \n     is my kind of conservative. He is intellectually honest. He \n     doesn't have an agenda. He is not an ideologue.\n\n  Judge Higginbotham, a hero to the civil rights movement in this \ncountry, would never have made such glowing remarks if he believed for \nan instant that Sam Alito was guilty of some of the false charges being \nmade against him.\n  More fundamentally, however, the claims that Judge Alito is biased \nagainst the little guy are based on a misconception of how judges are \nsupposed to behave. Judges are not supposed to decide cases on \nsympathy. Just as we ask jurors when they come into our courtrooms all \nacross this great country to put aside their sympathies, biases, and \nprejudices and decide the cases based on the evidence they hear in \ncourt and the law as given to them by the judges--and they do it, day \nin and day out, faithfully and to really an exceptional degree--of \ncourse, we expect judges not to decide cases on sympathy. The kind of \narguments we are hearing suggest that judges ought to pick out the \nparty they like best, the most sympathetic, and rule in their favor \nwithout regard to the facts and without regard to the law.\n  One would not know by listening to some of Judge Alito's opponents \nthat he is a fairminded judge. In the America of his opponents, no \nplaintiff ever loses a case; no entrepreneur ever wins no matter how \nfrivolous the claim of employment discrimination; police departments \nnever win a case no matter how desperate the claim of a criminal \ndefendant; Government agencies, including the Environmental Protection \nAgency and the Social Security Administration, could never win a case \nno matter how outlandish the request for Government benefits. In their \nutopia, the economy is wrecked by frivolous litigation, criminals run \nfree on technicalities, and the public Treasury is plundered.\n  This admittedly, and thankfully, is not Judge Alito's America. He \nbelieves that no one is above the law--not the President, not the \nCongress, not even the little guy. That is why Lady Justice has always \nbeen blindfolded.\n  America is a nation of laws, not of men and women, not of little \nguys, not of big guys, but a nation of laws. It should not matter who \nyou are, how you pronounce your last name, what your country of origin \nis, your race, or any other extraneous consideration when you enter the \nhalls of justice. We are all guaranteed, under the words that are \netched over the marble leading into the Supreme Court, ``equal justice \nunder the law.''\n  Everything in his record shows that these extraneous considerations \ndon't matter to Judge Alito. This is why people of good faith from all \nacross the political spectrum have testified and given testimonials in \nsupport of his work as a judge and on behalf of his nomination to the \nSupreme Court. This is also why I believe he will be confirmed by the \nSenate.\n  Madam President, I could not be happier to throw my support behind \nthis good man, this good judge, and this public servant.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, I rise to echo and add to the remarks of \nthe Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn. On this first day of debate, I rise \nto express my strong support for the confirmation of Judge Samuel Alito \nto be a Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States of America.\n  There has been much discussion, advertising on the radio, in \nnewspapers, and on television. There has been commentary about Judge \nAlito, and that is fine. That is the way it should be. Federal judges \nare appointed for life. This is the only time that the people's \nrepresentatives--those of us in the Senate--have an opportunity to \nscrutinize an individual who has been nominated for the Federal bench \nin a lifetime appointment. So that scrutiny is appropriate. I am \nhopeful that this scrutiny and this discussion will be of a civil \nnature. Sometimes it has not been, over the last several years in this \nbody.\n  I do believe, though, that all nominees who are reported out of a \ncommittee, whether the Judiciary Committee--for that matter, any \ncommittee--Foreign Relations, or other committees, ought to be accorded \nthe fairness of an up-or-down vote at the end of this gauntlet. If you \nare going to make someone go through all of this, have all these slings \nand arrows, some relevant, some tangential, and some completely \nirrelevant. If they are going to go through all of this, they ought to \nbe accorded the fairness of an up-or-down vote.\n  I believe if the approaches taken over the last several years for \ncertain nominees continue, as a threat or as an actual practical \nimpediment to someone receiving a vote, it will make it much more \ndifficult for any President to be able to recruit from the private \nsector qualified men and women who have the experience, the \npersonality, the insight, the leadership, and the ability to serve our \nGovernment. That might be in a variety of different fields. That is why \nI think it is important that we as Senators change and stop this \npractice of holding up nominees and not according them the fairness of \nan up-or-down vote.\n  With John Roberts to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, we \nallowed a lot of commentary and a vote. I hope the same will occur for \nJudge Alito.\n  There have been indications from those on the other side of the aisle \nthat they are reserving the right to filibuster, or require a 60-vote \nmajority to have a vote on the confirmation of Judge Alito. My reaction \nis if they move forward with such a filibuster, ``make my day.'' We \nwill enjoy pulling the constitutional trigger to allow Judge Alito a \nfair or up-or-down vote.\n  I don't think it is too much to ask Senators to come here when the \nnomination is called forth to get off these cushy seats, stand up \nstraight, and vote yes or vote no. That is a matter of fairness. It is \nalso our constitutional responsibility in advise and consent.\n  When analyzing or determining whether I am going to support a \nparticular judicial nominee, what matters most to me for these lifetime \nappointments is trying to discern that nominee's judicial philosophy. \nTrying to determine whether they believe what they are saying as to \nwhat they think the proper role of a judge will be.\n  We have seen through the years that certain individuals get appointed \nfor a lifetime appointment, and they end up being completely different \nthan what they have said in the hearings, in interviews with the \nPresident, or interviews with the Senators. Past performance is, in my \nview, usually a reliable indicator of future action.\n  In my view, regarding this particular nomination of Judge Alito, the \nbest way to determine what kind of Justice Samuel Alito will be on the \nSupreme Court is to look at his 15 years of services as a circuit court \njudge. In his years on the bench, he has embodied the philosophy I like \nto see in judges. I believe the proper role of a judge is to apply the \nlaw, not invent the law. Judges are to uphold the Constitution, not \namend it by judicial decree.\n  The proper role of a judge is to protect and indeed defend our God-\ngiven rights, not to create or deny rights out of thin air. They are \nnot to act as a legislator.\n  In Judge Alito's case, no matter the issue, whether or not they are \npolitically charged issues in the realm of electoral politics, he \nseems, from my reading and review, to have followed a\n\n[[Page S56]]\n\nconsistent, thoughtful, deliberative process to decide cases.\n  This is what judges are supposed to do. They are not supposed to be \nissuing cases based on predetermined ideology, or an eye toward future \nconfirmation hearings. They should faithfully apply the law. They ought \nto apply the evidence before the court to the law in that particular \ncase before the court.\n  As he stated in his opening statement before the Judiciary Committee, \nJudge Alito recognized a judge's only obligation is to the rule of law. \nAnd in every single case, the judge has to do what the law requires. In \nmy opinion, that is the essence of the fair adjudication of disputes. \nThere is credibility, there is reliability, and there is integrity in \nthat approach. Judge Alito has exemplary, scholarly, and experienced \nqualifications--and especially the proper judicial philosophy--to serve \nhonorably as a Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  In Judge Alito's 15 years on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, he \nhas demonstrated his understanding of the proper role of a judge in our \nconstitutional system of Government, and will apply the law fairly and \nequally.\n  Judge Alito, in my view, genuinely respects the rule of law in our \nrepresentative democracy. In recognition of Judge Alito's outstanding \nservice on the Federal bench, the American Bar Association has given \nhim their highest rating of well qualified. The American Bar \nAssociation's criteria for their evaluation are integrity, \nprofessionalism, competence, and judicial temperament.\n  Let me share with my colleagues what Stephen Tober, the chairman of \nthe American Bar Association Standing Committee, had to say.\n  He said:\n\n       On The Federal Judiciary: ``Needless to say, to merit an \n     evaluation of well-qualified, the nominee must possess \n     professional qualifications and achievements of the highest \n     standing. . . . We are ultimately persuaded that Judge Alito \n     has, throughout his 15 years on the Federal Bench, \n     established a record of both proper judicial conduct and \n     even-handed application in seeking to do what is \n     fundamentally fair. . . . His integrity, his professional \n     competence and his judicial temperament are, indeed, found to \n     be of the highest standard.''\n\n  That came from Chairman Tober on January 12 of this year.\n  Judge Alito also provided to all of us an indication of his \ntemperament and qualifications during his confirmation hearings, which \nwent on for several days and many hours of hearings. He answered over \n700 questions, explaining his thought processes, judicial philosophy, \nand I think very credibly dispelling some of the misstatements about \nhis record of service.\n  Judge Alito was even forced to defend the statements of others when \nhe was questioned about the Concerned Alumni of Princeton. That is a \ngroup that apparently Judge Alito joined when he was a member of the \nArmed Services because he didn't agree with the way the military was \ntreated on the Princeton campus. As a result, some of the Democratic \nSenators tried to diminish Judge Alito. The Wall Street Journal had an \neditorial on January 12 of this year where they said they are trying to \nfind him guilty by ``ancient association.'' Let me quote from the Wall \nStreet Journal editorial page of that date.\n\n       They can't touch him on credentials or his mastery of \n     jurisprudence, so they're trying to get him on guilt by \n     ancient association. Senators Ted Kennedy and Chuck Schumer \n     did their best yesterday to imply that Judge Alito was racist \n     and sexist by linking the nominee with the views of some \n     members of Concerned Alumni of Princeton, which back in the \n     1970s and 1980s took issue with university policies on \n     coeducation and affirmative action.\n\n  Of course, Judge Alito said he didn't agree with any of that. He was \nconcerned about fair access for our military recruiters on campus.\n  The closing lines in the Wall Street Journal editorial stated:\n\n       As for Judge Alito's prospects, if this irrelevant arcania \n     is the most his opponents have, he can start measuring his \n     new judicial robes.\n\n  Another comment made by some members of the Judiciary Committee is \nthey don't have the assurance that the judge firmly believes in \nprecedent. They criticize him for apparently having an open mind.\n  What some Senators choose to do is not recognize that there are times \nwhere precedent should be overturned such as the Court overruling \nPlessy v. Ferguson and Korematsu v. United States.\n  Also, as time changes and our country develops, the case law that \ncomes before the Supreme Court also changes, to recognize the advances \nin technology and science.\n  In Roe v. Wade, Justice Blackmun recognized that advancements in \nmedical science will impact the trimester standard for when the State's \ninterest in life begins.\n  As constitutional jurisprudence moves forward, Judge Alito, with his \nunderstanding that stare decisis is not an ``inexorable command,'' \nmakes a great deal of sense. We have seen that throughout the history \nof our country.\n  There were some comments made during his confirmation process by the \ngroups objecting to the nomination of Judge Alito that they disagree \nwith the conclusion he reached after an independent review of the facts \nof a particular case. While these groups, and all Americans, have an \nimportant role in a free society and deserve to state their view, they \nalso in some cases are distorting the proper role of a judge. On the \nbench, Judge Alito has not been a partisan activist. To the contrary, \nthere have been no substantive claims that any litigant before Judge \nAlito did not have a fair and impartial hearing of their case. Factors \nwhether a President should be overturned, or modified--there are many \nfactors, such as the nature of the original decision, whether that \nprecedent has been changed, or there is a desire on the part of the \npeople who are the owners of the Government to change it. Another \nfactor could be whether the precedent has been undermined by subsequent \ndecisions or new facts or new laws.\n\n  Court decisions have been changed over the years because they have \nproven to be unworkable. The Court has overruled many decisions. Of \ncourse, Brown v. Board of Education overruling Plessy v. Ferguson is \nprobably the prime example and illustrates that no precedent is \nuntouchable. The Court should not be required to stick to bad law--in \nthat case, separate but equal.\n  Judges do not run for office. They cannot and should not make \ncampaign promises that are, in fact, prohibited. They are prohibited \nfrom doing so by the Code of Judicial Conduct of the American Bar \nAssociation. They also should not be judged on the basis of statements \nthey made when working for elected public servants in the legislative \nor executive branches of Government. They should be judged by their \nrecord of service.\n  Again, with Judge Alito, we see a person with 15 years of judicial \nexperience. We have seen, in too many cases, with the lifetime-\nappointed Federal judges, a complete disregard for the will of the \npeople and their elected representatives who are supposed to be making \nthe laws reflecting the will and the values of the people in particular \nStates or maybe the Nation in our representative democracy.\n  People wonder: Why do we care about the activist judges? Why does \njudicial philosophy matter? I will go through recent decisions by \nactivist judges who forget their role is to apply the law, not invent \nthe law.\n  In California, certain counties thought it was a good idea to have \nchildren in schools say the Pledge of Allegiance. When I was Governor \nof Virginia, we passed such a law. But someone out there in the Ninth \nCircuit thought, no, we cannot have the Pledge of Allegiance in public \nschools in California because of the words ``under God.'' That is an \nexample of judges completely ignoring the will of the people in those \nregions of California and striking down the Pledge of Allegiance \nbecause of the words ``under God.'' This is a ludicrous decision.\n  We also see judges ignoring the will of the people in a variety of \nother ways. They struck down some laws in Virginia within the last 2 \nyears because of international standards. Friends, colleagues, we make \nthe laws. We represent the people of this country. It is our \nConstitution. It is not the U.N. constitution or various \nconglomerations or what confederations of other countries may think our \nlaws should be. The laws are made by the people of this country.\n  A continuing debate has to do with parental notification. People in \nVirginia, when I was Governor, and other\n\n[[Page S57]]\n\nStates thought, if an unwed minor daughter is going through the \nsurgery, the trauma of an abortion, and is 17 years old or younger, a \nparent ought to be involved. After all, if a child is going to get a \ntattoo or their ears pierced, they need parental consent. So the laws \nare passed by various States, there is one in contention dealing with \nNew Hampshire. Federal judges, ignoring the will of the people in \nvarious States, strike down and allow those laws to be overturned.\n  Last year, in the summer, the Supreme Court got involved in a case \nthat created a great deal of concern because the city of New London, \nCT, the city council, acting akin to commissars, decided they were \ngoing to take people's homes, the American dream, and condemn those \nhomes, take them not for a school, not for a road or any such public \npurpose, but rather they wanted to derive more tax revenue off of that \nproperty. This is part of the Bill of Rights, the fifth amendment. The \nSupreme Court, in a very narrow decision, allowed New London, CT, in \nthe Kelo case, to take away people's homes. This is an example of \nSupreme Court Justices, Federal judges, selected and serving for life, \namending our Bill of Rights, the Constitution--the Bill of Rights is \nthe most important part of all the Constitution--by judicial decree. \nThat is wrong. This is why it is important we have men and women \nserving on the Federal bench that understand their role is to apply the \nlaw and not take away our God-given rights enshrined in the Bill of \nRights and in our Constitution.\n  I met with Judge Alito in my office and discussed with him my \nconcerns about this troubling trend of judges who ignore the will of \nthe people and start inventing laws themselves. I was actually very \nencouraged by his scholarship, his knowledge, and what I feel was a \nvery genuine, sincere understanding that we need a respectful, \nrestrained judiciary. And also his ability to cite examples from his \nvery distinguished career of cases where he was presented with \ndecisions where he put aside his personal view and followed the law.\n  I asked: What do you do if you do not like a law? He said: You have \nto apply the law, but it may be appropriate after the decision is made, \nfor a judge or panel of judges to communicate with the legislature and \nadvise them they may wish to revisit a certain issue. However, when it \ncame to issuing a decision, he felt very strongly that judges would \nfollow their duty and should incorporate the law as written.\n  Another quality of Judge Alito is his deep knowledge of the law and \nhis sincere and deep commitment of being a student of our Constitution. \nWhen I asked Judge Alito about his role, his view of the role of the \nState to pass laws, he gave a thoughtful answer. He had a considered \nanalysis of the dormant commerce clause. It was similar to being back \nin law school, learning some of these things again. His answer shows \nmost importantly a deep understanding not only of the Constitution but \nalso a commitment to the fundamental principles upon which this country \nwas founded, that Government power should remain closest to the people.\n  In our system of government, it is essential the people in the States \nbe free to experiment in public policy and that Washington, the Federal \nGovernment, should not dictate policy through the use of Federal funds \nin areas reserved to the States or to the people.\n  Opponents of this nomination have referenced half a dozen cases out \nof the more than 1,500 he has been involved in while serving on the \nThird Circuit Court of Appeals. The fact is, no matter how Judge Alito \nanswered the questions posed to him, his detractors would continue to \noppose his nomination. On the particularly important charge that he \nfavors an expansive view of the Executive power, Judge Alito reiterated \nhis view that no branch of Government has more power and that no person \nin this country, no matter how high or powerful, is above the law; no \nperson in this country is beneath the law.\n  Aside from this very unambiguous answer, one can point to a litany of \ncases where Judge Alito came down against the authority of the \nGovernment, or for the little guy as some people like to call it.\n  Another criticism of this nomination has been that Judge Alito, if \nconfirmed, will replace a moderate on the Court, retiring Justice \nSandra Day O'Connor. Sandra Day O'Connor by the way, in Kelo v. New \nLondon, CT, ``commissar taking of homes'' case, ruled on the side of \nthe Constitution, so there will be no change there. We will need to get \nanother Justice if the States are not able to rein in such takings of \nhomes.\n  Justice O'Connor is a person for whom I have a great deal of respect. \nShe served with great distinction on the Court for many years and has a \ncompelling, interesting life story. The fact that President Reagan \nappointed her as the first woman on the Supreme Court of the United \nStates as a pioneer in so many ways has been an inspiration to many \nyoung people, regardless of gender. Particularly many young women who \nthink, There is a future for me in the law. We have seen a great \nincrease in the number of young women interested in studying in our law \nschools.\n  They will say that we have to have someone who has the exact same \nphilosophy as whoever was being replaced. We ought to remember the \nFounders, in drafting article III of the Constitution that creates the \nSupreme Court, provides no requirement there must be an ideological \nbalance on the Court. For over 200 years, the Senate has respected the \nprerogative of the President and performed their advice-and-consent \nfunction and ultimately voted for qualified judges, despite their \npolitical orientation.\n  So, therefore, let me conclude in this statement to my colleagues \nthat if you look at Judge Alito's 15 years of exemplary judicial \nexperience, his incredible, well-reasoned answers in the confirmation \nhearings. If you look at this individual, who has the qualifications, \nthe judicial philosophy, the knowledge of the law, the respect for the \nlaw and, indeed, the respect for the people, the owners of this \nGovernment, and those of us in the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives, and other bodies, Judge Alito is a perfect person to \nbe an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States. I \nrespectfully urge my colleagues to vote affirmatively for Judge Alito \nto serve this country on the Supreme Court.\n  I thank you for your attention, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, I also rise today to express my \nsupport for the confirmation of Judge Samuel Alito as an Associate \nJustice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  The Constitution demands that the President's nominees to the Supreme \nCourt receive the advice and consent of a majority of Senators. The \nstandard to be used is not spelled out in the Constitution, but 200 \nyears of tradition offers a guide. That guide, that standard, applied \nto nominees throughout our history, is the very same standard we should \napply today to Judge Samuel Alito. By that standard, Judge Alito is \nwell qualified.\n  Since graduating from Yale Law School in 1975, Judge Alito has had an \nexemplary legal career, serving as U.S. attorney, Assistant U.S. \nSolicitor General, and 15 years as a member of the Third Circuit Court \nof Appeals. During that lengthy tenure in court, we have had the \nbenefit of seeing Judge Alito's commitment to the rule of law and his \ncommitment to an impartial review of the law and the facts of any given \ncase.\n  As Alexander Hamilton noted in Federalist No. 78, if the courts are \nto be truly independent, judges cannot substitute their own preferences \nto the ``constitutional intentions of the [legislative branch].''\n  Judge Alito clearly expressed during his confirmation hearings, and \nhis judicial career attests to the fact, that he would not impose his \npersonal views over the demands of the law and precedent. I find that \nrefreshing, I find that encouraging, and I find that a strong reason \nfor supporting the nomination of Judge Alito.\n  I take great comfort in the fact that Judge Alito has received the \nunanimous approval of the American Bar Association's committee that \nreviews judicial candidates. This is a committee that is greatly \nrespected by the legal profession, as well as the general public, for \ntheir impartiality and demand and insistence on and careful watch over \na quality judiciary. The American\n\n[[Page S58]]\n\nBar Association's committee that reviews judicial candidates is \ninterested and committed to a quality judiciary.\n  Judge Alito not only received their unanimous approval, but he \nreceived their most qualified rating. That means each and every one of \nthe members of that committee gave Judge Alito their highest, most \nqualified rating. This should weigh heavily in favor of the \nconfirmation of Judge Alito.\n  What we know--after the confirmation hearings, after extensive \ninteraction with Members of the Senate, after 3 days of testimony \nbefore the Judiciary Committee, and responses to a wide range of \nwritten questions by Senators after the hearings--is that Judge Alito \nis a humble and dispassionate judge, with a deep understanding and \nmodest view of his judicial role in the governance of our Nation and \nrespect for the limitations of precedent.\n  He has an awareness of the dangers of looking to foreign \njurisdictions for guidance in shaping the laws of our land and a \ncommitment to respecting the proper role of the courts in the \ninterpretation of the law.\n  I am persuaded that Judge Alito will look to establish precedents, be \nrespectful of the doctrine of stare decisis, and will use the \nConstitution and the law as his guideposts as opposed to any personal \nwhim or political agenda.\n  There are those who would say they are troubled by what they \nperceive, that Judge Alito would not side with the ``little guy'' when \ndeciding cases. Let my tell you, I am someone who, for 25 years, took \nclients' matters to court, more often than not representing the little \nguy. But even with that experience, I am more committed than ever to \nthe belief I had when I took a client to court, whether a little guy or \na big guy. My hope, my prayer, was that my client would find an \nimpartial judge.\n\n  It is unthinkable to me to suggest this standard today should be that \nwe should look for whether a judge will purposely lean in favor of one \nside of the litigation or another before selecting who our judges ought \nto be. Our judges must be impartial. Our judges must not be there for \nthe little guy or for the big guy. Judges need to take the facts and \nthe law, interpret them and utilize them to reach a fair and just \nverdict, as dictated by the laws of our Nation, not because they favor \na little guy, not because they favor a big guy. If the law and the \nfacts happen to be on the side of the little guy, the little guy should \nprevail. If the law and the facts happen to be on the side of the big \nguy, then our system of justice demands that the big guy should \nprevail.\n  I love the analogy that Chief Justice Roberts used during the course \nof his confirmation. In selecting a Justice to the Supreme Court, he \nsaid we are looking for an umpire. We are not looking for a pitcher. We \nare not looking for a batter. We are looking for the umpire--the guy \nwho will call the balls and the strikes fairly and impartially to all \nlitigants before the Court.\n  Our long-held traditions in our system of justice demand fairness, \ndemand integrity, demand judicial temperament. Judge Alito fulfills all \nof those requirements amply, and I am satisfied he will make an \nexceptional Justice of the Supreme Court.\n  Judge Alito has made it abundantly clear that his personal views have \nabsolutely no place in performing his judicial role in our \nconstitutional structure. Rather, the Constitution, statutes, and \ncontrolling prior decisions, as applied to the facts of the case at \nhand, are the sole basis for his judicial determinations. I find that, \nas it should be, the correct standard to apply to a judicial nominee \nfor determining his fitness for this high office.\n  At the end of the day, we know that elections have consequences. The \nfact that the voters have placed President Bush in the office of \nPresident now for a second term has also been an indication that \nPresident Bush deserves and should be allowed to have his pick for the \nCourt.\n  It is our tradition that Presidents nominate, select, and fill \nvacancies to the Court, while the Senate's role is one of advice and \nconsent. We simply do not have the prerogative of deciding who it is we \nwould prefer to see on the Court or who it is we might find more \nphilosophically suitable to us or more to our liking. Our role as \nSenators is to provide the President with the advice and consent on the \nqualifications of those he seeks to put in this high office.\n  I see an evolving new standard before us. I heard from the members of \nthe Judiciary Committee who did not support this nominee the setting of \na brand new standard, and it is no longer qualifications, but it is now \nwhether they philosophically will judge this person to be the kind of \nperson they would want based on their political philosophy. That, I \nwould suggest, is wrong. It has never been the standard applied or \nutilized by our Nation as we have sought to confirm Justices to our \nCourt for over 200 years. I would say it is absolutely wrong to begin \nthat new standard and leave it unchallenged as we seek the confirmation \nof one more Justice to the Supreme Court.\n  My advice and consent is that Judge Alito is one of the select few \nHamilton had in mind as having the character, intelligence, and \ntemperament to guard the liberties secured by our Constitution. I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to support his nomination to the Supreme \nCourt.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Coal Mining Tragedies in West Virginia\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, while the Senate was in recess, the State \nof West Virginia lost 14 proud sons.\n  On January 2, 13 hard-working, God-fearing men were simply earning \ntheir daily bread at the Sago coal mine in Upshur County, WV, when an \nexplosion killed 1 man and trapped 12 others 260 feet below its \nsurface. For 41 long hours, these men waited for help. They waited, \nthey waited, they waited, and they prayed. They wrote farewell messages \nto their loved ones. How gripping. They waited as the air they breathed \ngave out and their lungs filled with toxic gases.\n  Above the ground, we all prayed for a miracle such as we had enjoyed \nwith the nine miners who had been trapped at the mine at Quecreek, PA, \nin 2002 and were found alive. But this time, there was only one \nmiracle. My wife Erma and I, like many others in my great State of West \nVirginia, continue to pray for the recovery of the sole survivor of the \nSago explosion, Mr. Randal McCloy, Jr. But tragically, there were no \nmiracles for Tom Anderson, Alva Bennett, Jim Bennett, Jerry Groves, \nGeorge ``Junior'' Hammer, Terry Helms, Jesse Jones, David Lewis, Martin \nToler, Jr., Fred Ware, Jr., Jackie Weaver, and Marshall Winans. Once \nagain, a small coal-mining town in West Virginia went into deep \nmourning, and an entire State wept with them.\n  And then, incredibly, 17 days later, a mine fire broke out on a \nconveyor belt at the Aracoma Alma Mine No. 1 in Logan County, WV, \ntrapping two miners underground. In shock and disbelief, the State once \nagain fell to its knees and prayed and pleaded for a miracle. Forty \nhours later, we learned that two more miners--Don Bragg and Ellery \nHatfield--had perished. Another small coal-mining town in West Virginia \nwent into deep mourning, and again an entire State wept with them.\n  Once again, the national media rushed in to report the disaster to \nthe world. Once again, editorials filled newspapers across the country \ndecrying the dangers of mining coal, denouncing the callousness of coal \ncompanies, and questioning the commitment of State and Federal \nofficials to mine safety.\n  Madam President, as a child of the Appalachian coalfields, as the son \nof a West Virginia coal miner, as a U.S. Senator representing one of \nthe most important coal-producing States in the Nation, let me say I \nhave seen it all before. Yes, I have seen it all before.\n  First, the disaster. Then the weeping. Then the outrage. And we are \nall too familiar with what comes next. After a few weeks, when the \ncameras are gone, when the ink on the editorials has dried, everything \nreturns to business as usual. The health and the safety of America's \ncoal miners, the men and women upon whom the Nation depends so much, is \nonce again forgotten until the next disaster. But not this time.\n\n[[Page S59]]\n\nLet me say that this U.S. Senator and the West Virginia delegation in \nthe House and in the Senate will do all that we can to prevent that. \nThere is blame to be assessed in the wake of these tragedies and plenty \nof it to go around.\n  Let us begin with the coal company that operated the Sago mine, which \nhad been issued 276 safety and health violations in 2004 and 2005. Let \nme try to put that into perspective. Could any automobile driver or any \ntruckdriver rack up 276 tickets for reckless driving and still keep a \nlicense? What if someone had 276 mistakes on a tax return? One can bet \nthat taxpayer would be looking at serious penalties and possibly time \nin a Federal prison. But here was a coal company with 276 Federal mine \nsafety violations still operating. While some of these were minor \ntransgressions, too many of them were ``significant and substantial'' \nor, simply put, very serious, and yet business went on as usual. It is \nquite possible that not one of these specific violations contributed to \nthe explosion at Sago. But 276 violations is certainly indicative of a \ncompany's sloppy attention toward the well-being of its employees. That \nshould be obvious on its face.\n  What about the agency that is responsible for making sure that coal \noperators comply with the spirit and the letter of the law--the Mine \nSafety and Health Administration. Let me be clear that I have nothing \nbut praise for the brave rescue teams that went into the Sago and Alma \nmines. Anybody who has been around a mine explosion knows the dangers \nthat still lurk not just hours but days after such an accident. To go \ninto a mine after a disaster, after an explosion, and to risk one's own \nlife in an effort to save other lives, as these rescuers do, takes \nguts. It takes a love for one's fellow man.\n  Coal miners are a special breed. I have seen these miners go into a \nmine after an explosion, risking their own lives, realizing that \nanother explosion might occur and another tragedy would follow in the \nwake of the first tragedy.\n  Yes, MSHA is filled with good, well-intentioned, and dedicated \nprofessionals, but something is terribly wrong with the leadership at \nMSHA.\n  Consider that for 4 straight years, President Bush has proposed to \ncut the budget for coal safety enforcement below the level enacted by \nCongress the previous year, and for 4 straight years the Congress has \nhad to struggle to partially restore those cuts. Some 190 coal \nenforcement personnel have been lost over the last 4 years through \nattrition, and they have not been replaced. The priorities reflected by \nthe Bush administration through MSHA's budget certainly are not \nindicative of a proper concern for the health and safety of miners.\n  On the day of the Sago disaster, 2 hours went by--2 hours, with 60 \ngolden minutes each, went by--before MSHA even knew about the \nexplosion. It took another 2 hours before MSHA personnel arrived at the \nscene. It took 1\\1/2\\ hours before the rescue teams arrived. Another 5 \nhours passed before the first team entered the mine. The Mine Act \nrequires that rescue teams be available to mines in the event of an \nemergency, and yet it took 10\\1/2\\ hours before the first rescue team \nbegan its effort at Sago.\n  A short 2 weeks later, similar horrors emerged from a second tragedy \nat the Aracoma Alma mine and, again, MSHA did not know of the incident \nfor 2\\1/2\\ hours. Something is incredibly wrong. It is obvious \nsomething is very, very wrong at MSHA. The rescue procedures for miners \nare woefully inadequate.\n  The Sago mine had been cited for 276 violations over the past 2 \nyears, and yet the mine operator never paid a fine larger than $440 and \noften only paid a minimal $60 fine. Few people realize that even when a \nfine is assessed, the coal operator can negotiate the fine to a \npiddling amount.\n  Congress recognized a long time ago that mine safety and health \ndepends on financial penalties that ``make it more economical for an \noperator to comply'' with the law ``than it is to pay the penalties \nassessed and continue to operate while not in compliance.'' Clearly, \nthe 276 penalties assessed--whatever the amount of the fine--weren't \nenough to convince this company to take a hard look at safety for its \nemployees.\n  The Sago mine was a habitual violator--a habitual violator. It was \nbeing assessed only the minimum penalties allowed by the law. The \nmaximum penalty could be $220,000 or $1 million, but it makes no \ndifference unless MSHA is willing to impose and collect that maximum \namount. Habitual violators must be brought to a state of fearing the \nconsequences of a heavy fine to be paid when assessed. We have to get \ntough about enforcing the law.\n  At MSHA, complacent attitudes and arrogance rule at the top. At the \nSenate Appropriations Labor-HHS Subcommittee hearing on Monday, Acting \nMSHA Secretary David Dye was asked directly about the issue of \ncommunications technology: Why are the miners trapped underground not \nable to communicate with the rescue teams, and can rescue teams better \nlocate trapped miners? Dye was asked directly if technology exists to \ncorrect these problems, and he stated for the record that such \ntechnology did not exist.\n  Now get that. Let me say that again. At this hearing, conducted by \none of the finest Senators on either side of the aisle here, Republican \nSenator Specter of Pennsylvania, at that record hearing, Acting MSHA \nSecretary David Dye was asked directly about the issue of \ncommunications technology: Why are the miners trapped underground not \nable to communicate with the rescue teams, and can rescue teams better \nlocate trapped miners? Dye was asked directly if technology exists to \ncorrect these problems, and he stated for the record that such \ntechnology did not exist.\n\n  How about that. That statement proved to be utterly, utterly, utterly \nfalse. Minutes later, after Dye was asked if such technology existed, \nthe subcommittee heard from a former MSHA Secretary, Davitt McAteer, \nwho verified that such communications technology certainly does exist, \nand Mr. McAteer put tracking and communications devices on the table--\non the table--right in front of the subcommittee.\n  What does that say about the people leading this agency when they \ndon't even know about the existence of lifesaving technology that ought \nto be in the mines? What does that say? Shame, shame on them. I am \ntalking about the people leading the agency when they testified that \nthey don't even know about the existence of lifesaving technology that \nought to be in the mines. Why is the Acting Administrator of MSHA, \ncharged with protecting the health and safety of coal miners, so \nabysmally ignorant of these technologies? The families of these miners \nand the Members of this Congress are owed an explanation.\n  In this day and age of cell phones, BlackBerrys, and text messaging, \nit is absolutely unacceptable that safe telecommunications technology \nwas not available to the Sago and Alma miners. These weaknesses in mine \nemergency preparedness are unacceptable. Where is MSHA? Repeating the \nfirst question that was ever asked in the history of mankind when God \nsought Adam in the Garden of Eden in the cool of the day. God said: \nAdam, where art thou? Well, where was MSHA? Where was MSHA? What is \nthat agency waiting for?\n  Ask the leadership at MSHA. At Sago and Alma, we have seen the \ndisastrous results of complacent attitudes at the top--at the top. A \nquick look at the list of rules approved and scuttled at MSHA in recent \nyears--from regulations governing mine rescue teams to the use of belt \nentries for ventilation to inspection procedures to emergency breathing \nequipment to escape routes, any one of which might figure into the \ndeaths and disasters at the Sago and Alma mines--suggest that \nsomething, something, something is terribly wrong. Something is \nterribly, terribly, terribly wrong, and it ought to be fixed.\n  In 1995, labor and industry jointly proposed a number of initiatives \non mine emergency preparedness to improve mine rescue technology and \ncommunications. Perhaps one of the most important was to address the \ndwindling number of mine rescue teams. MSHA has ignored the report and \nits recommendations. In 2003, the General Accountability Office made a \nlist of recommendations to the Secretary of Labor to help MSHA protect \nthe safety and health of the miners. What happened? MSHA ignored the \nrecommendation. Shame, shame.\n  Our Nation's coal miners are vital to our national economy. During \nWorld War I, coal miners put in long, brutal\n\n[[Page S60]]\n\nhours to make sure that the Nation had coal to heat our homes, power \nour factories, and fuel our battleships. In World War II, American coal \nminers again provided the energy to replace the oil that was lost with \nthe outbreak of that global conflict. During the oil boycott-induced \nenergy crisis of the 1970s, our Nation once again called upon--yes, our \nNation once again turned, yes, to the coal miners to bail the Nation \nout of trouble, and the coal miners did.\n  Coal produces over half of the electricity we use every day in these \nUnited States. Here is an example of it all around the ceiling here, \nthe lights that are burning making it bright as day right here in this \nChamber. That is coal. That is energy that comes from coal, burning \ncoal--coal that is produced by hard, backbreaking labor in the \ndangerous mines. Coal is dug out, scratched out by the coal miner.\n  So today America's coal miners provide the electricity--the \nelectricity right here--the electricity that lights the streets of \nWashington, New York City, Sacramento, and all over this country, and \nit heats our homes in winter, lights our homes in summer.\n  Those coal miners could provide the key to our Nation's future energy \nsecurity. You can bet on those coal miners--and they are of a different \nbreed, a special breed. If we made better use of this abundant natural \nresource, coal, we could reduce our country's dangerous dependency on \nforeign oil.\n  We could make ourselves less dependent on the rule of despots, and \nless of a target for the fanatics and the terrorists of the Middle \nEast.\n  God blessed our country. Yes, the Almighty who was there at the \nbeginning blessed our Nation, especially West Virginia with an \nabundance of coal, and God provided us with the good, the brave, the \nhard-working coal miners to dig that coal and bring it from the Earth, \nthe bowels, the dark, the black, the darkness. The coal miners have \nnever failed our Nation.\n  I know. I grew up in a coal miner's home. I married a coal miner's \ndaughter. Her brother-in-law died from black lung. His father was \nkilled under a slate fall.\n  We have lived--my family has lived--with coal miners. We have coal \nminers in our families. We have lost loved ones.\n  The test of a great country such as ours is how serious we are about \nprotecting those among us who are most at risk, whether it be innocent \nchildren who need guarding from hunger and disease or our elderly and \nsick who cannot afford medication. Those men and women who bravely \nlabor in such dangerous occupations as coal mining to provide our \ncountry with critical energy should be protected from exploitation by \nprivate companies with callous attitudes about health and safety. That \nis why MSHA exists. That is why we created MSHA. That is why I was here \nwhen that agency was created. But MSHA is just a paper tiger without \naggressive leadership. If we are truly a moral nation, and I believe \nthat we should be, moral values must be reflected in government \nagencies that are charged with protecting the lives of our citizens. \nThe last thing that we need is ho hum, arrogant attitudes from this \nadministration and its officials. Such calumny abuses the public trust \nand results in the kind of loss of life that so grieves families today \nin Upshur and Logan Counties and all across my home State of West \nVirginia.\n  Madam President, in memory of the Sago and Alma Miners, and all those \nwho labor and have labored in our nation's coal mines, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the eulogy of Homer Hickam, from the Sago Memorial Service \non January 15, 2006, be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Families of the Sago miners, Governor Manchin, Mrs. \n     Manchin, Senator Byrd, Senator Rockefeller, West Virginians, \n     friends, neighbors, all who have come here today to remember \n     those brave men who have gone on before us, who ventured into \n     the darkness but instead showed us the light, a light that \n     shines on all West Virginians and the nation today:\n       It is a great honor to be here. I am accompanied by three \n     men I grew up with, the rocket boys of Coalwood: Roy Lee \n     Cooke, Jimmie O'Dell Carroll, and Billy Rose. My wife Linda, \n     an Alabama girl, is here with me as well.\n       As this tragedy unfolded, the national media kept asking \n     me: Who are these men? And why are they coal miners? And what \n     kind of men would still mine the deep coal?\n       One answer came early after the miners were recovered. It \n     was revealed that, as his life dwindled, Martin Toler had \n     written this: It wasn't bad. I just went to sleep. Tell all \n     I'll see them on the other side. I love you.\n       In all the books I have written, I have never captured in \n     so few words a message so powerful or eloquent: It wasn't \n     bad. I just went to sleep. Tell all I'll see them on the \n     other side. I love you.\n       I believe Mr. Toler was writing for all of the men who were \n     with him that day. These were obviously not ordinary men.\n       But what made these men so extraordinary? And how did they \n     become the men they were? Men of honor. Men you could trust. \n     Men who practiced a dangerous profession. Men who dug coal \n     from beneath a jealous mountain.\n       Part of the answer is where they lived. Look around you. \n     This is a place where many lessons are learned, of true \n     things that shape people as surely as rivers carve valleys, \n     or rain melts mountains, or currents push apart the sea. \n     Here, miners still walk with a trudging grace to and from \n     vast, deep mines. And in the schools, the children still \n     learn and the teachers teach, and, in snowy white churches \n     built on hillside cuts, the preachers still preach, and God, \n     who we have no doubt is also a West Virginian, still does his \n     work, too. The people endure here as they always have for \n     they understand that God has determined that there is no joy \n     greater than hard work, and that there is no water holier \n     than the sweat off a man's brow.\n       In such a place as this, a dozen men may die, but death can \n     never destroy how they lived their lives, or why.\n       As I watched the events of this tragedy unfold, I kept \n     being reminded of Coalwood, the mining town where I grew up. \n     Back then, I thought life in that little town was pretty \n     ordinary, even though nearly all the men who lived there \n     worked in the mine and, all too often, some of them died or \n     was hurt. My grandfather lost both his legs in the Coalwood \n     mine and lived in pain until the day he died. My father lost \n     the sight in an eye while trying to rescue trapped miners. \n     After that he worked in the mine for fifteen more years. He \n     died of black lung.\n       When I began to write my books about growing up in West \n     Virginia, I was surprised to discover, upon reflection, that \n     maybe it wasn't such an ordinary place at all. I realized \n     that in a place where maybe everybody should be afraid after \n     all, every day the men went off to work in a deep, dark, and \n     dangerous coal mine instead they had adopted a philosophy of \n     life that consisted of these basic attitudes:\n       We are proud of who we are. We stand up for what we \n     believe. We keep our families together. We trust in God but \n     rely on ourselves.\n       By adhering to these simple approaches to life, they became \n     a people who were not afraid to do what had to be done, to \n     mine the deep coal, and to do it with integrity and honor.\n       The first time my dad ever took me in the mine was when I \n     was in high school. He wanted to show me where he worked, \n     what he did for a living. I have to confess I was pretty \n     impressed. But what I recall most of all was what he said to \n     me while we were down there. He put his spot of light in my \n     face and explained to me what mining meant to him. He said, \n     ``Every day, I ride the mantrip down the main line, get out \n     and walk back into the gob and feel the air pressure on my \n     face. I know the mine like I know a man, can sense things \n     about it that aren't right even when everything on paper says \n     it is. Every day there's something that needs to be done, \n     because men will be hurt if it isn't done, or the coal the \n     company's promised to load won't get loaded. Coal is the life \n     blood of this country. If we fail, the country fails.''\n       And then he said, ``There's no men in the world like \n     miners, Sonny. They're good men, strong men. The best there \n     is. I think no matter what you do with your life, no matter \n     where you go or who you know, you will never know such good \n     and strong men.''\n       Over time, though I would meet many famous people from \n     astronauts to actors to Presidents, I came to realize my \n     father was right. There are no better men than coal miners. \n     And he was right about something else, too:\n       If coal fails, our country fails.\n       The American economy rests on the back of the coal miner. \n     We could not prosper without him. God in His wisdom provided \n     this country with an abundance of coal, and he also gave us \n     the American coal miner who glories in his work. A television \n     interviewer asked me to describe work in a coal mine and I \n     called it ``beautiful.'' He was astonished that I would say \n     such a thing so I went on to explain that, yes, it's hard \n     work but, when it all comes together, it's like watching and \n     listening to a great symphony: the continuous mining \n     machines, the shuttle cars, the roof bolters, the ventilation \n     brattices, the conveyor belts, all in concert, all \n     accomplishing their great task. Yes, it is a beautiful thing \n     to see.\n       There is a beauty in anything well done, and that goes for \n     a life well lived.\n       How and why these men died will be studied now and in the \n     future. Many lessons will be learned. And many other miners \n     will live because of what is learned. This is right and \n     proper.\n\n[[Page S61]]\n\n       But how and why these men lived, that is perhaps the more \n     important thing to be studied. We know this much for certain: \n     They were men who loved their families. They were men who \n     worked hard. They were men of integrity, and honor. And they \n     were also men who laughed and knew how to tell a good story. \n     Of course they could. They were West Virginians!\n       And so we come together on this day to recall these men, \n     and to glory in their presence among us, if only for a little \n     while. We also come in hope that this service will help the \n     families with their great loss and to know the honor we wish \n     to accord them.\n       No matter what else might be said or done concerning these \n     events, let us forever be reminded of who these men really \n     were and what they believed, and who their families are, and \n     who West Virginians are, and what we believe, too.\n       There are those now in the world who would turn our nation \n     into a land of fear and the frightened. It's laughable, \n     really. How little they understand who we are, that we are \n     still the home of the brave. They need look no further than \n     right here in this state for proof.\n       For in this place, this old place, this ancient place, this \n     glorious and beautiful and sometimes fearsome place of \n     mountains and mines, there still lives a people like the \n     miners of Sago and their families, people who yet believe in \n     the old ways, the old virtues, the old truths; who still lift \n     their heads from the darkness to the light, and say for the \n     nation and all the world to hear:\n       We are proud of who we are.\n       We stand up for what we believe.\n       We keep our families together.\n       We trust in God.\n       We do what needs to be done.\n       We are not afraid.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, could we have an agreement on the time? I \napologize, I was supposed to have the time between 1:30 and 2. Since \nthe Senator from Kentucky is waiting--I wanted, obviously, to be able \nto complete my statement--we have agreed to switch times. He will speak \nfor 15 minutes, with the agreement that I would then speak after.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of Samuel \nAlito's nomination to the United States Supreme Court.\n  Judge Alito is supremely qualified.\n  He has a record of fairness and judicial restraint. He will do a fine \njob on the Supreme Court.\n  I will vote for his nomination and any procedural measures necessary \nto confirm him on the Senate floor.\n  Confirmation of a Supreme Court Justice is one of the most import \njobs we have as Senators.\n  This will be the second Supreme Court nominee I will have considered \nsince coming to the Senate.\n  I take this responsibility very seriously.\n  I have spent time with Judge Alito and I have studied his background \nand record.\n  I closely followed his confirmation hearings in the Judiciary \nCommittee. I can say without question that he should be confirmed.\n  I don't find myself agreeing with the Washington Post or the \nLouisville Courier-Journal newspapers very often.\n  But even those papers agree that Judge Alito should be confirmed.\n  I first met Judge Alito this past fall.\n  I did not know much about him when his nomination was announced by \nPresident Bush.\n  I reserved judgment about his nomination until I had a chance to meet \nwith him.\n  From that meeting it became clear that I could support his \nnomination.\n  And his performance at his confirmation hearing further solidified my \nsupport for his nomination.\n  We are all familiar with the basics of Judge Alito's background.\n  He has been on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals for 15 years.\n  He has participated in several thousand cases and written several \nhundred opinions.\n  He attended top schools for both college and law school--Princeton \nand Yale.\n  I gather all of my colleagues would agree that those things are \nimportant and impressive--but they do not alone qualify him for the \njob.\n  There is a lot more to being qualified for the Supreme Court than \npedigree and judicial experience.\n  Judicial philosophy and one's approach to judging and the law are \nmost important.\n  All these factors and more must be looked at and weighed before \ndeciding if a nominee is qualified.\n  I have done so and it is clear to me that Judge Alito should be \nconfirmed.\n  A good place to begin is with Judge Alito's record on the Third \nCircuit Court of Appeals.\n  He has participated in over 3,000 cases and written over 300 \nopinions.\n  His record in those cases shows that he is fair and impartial. And \nthat he understands the law and the judicial process.\n  His opinions are written clearly and provide clear guidance to the \nlower courts.\n  Clarity is something we certainly need on the Supreme Court.\n  The clarity and fairness of Judge Alito's opinions speak well to his \nqualifications.\n  But what speaks volumes is that his critics have been unable to find \na single case he participated in to show that he is unqualified as a \njudge.\n  That is not to say that his critics have not tried. But to use any \ncase against him--critics have had to distort the record or confuse the \nissue.\n  Judge Alito's opponents are trying to stop his nomination.\n  They are concerned he will be a vote for the rule of law and the \nConstitution. And not a judicial activist to their liking on the \nSupreme Court.\n  The framers of the Constitution created a system of government where \nthe peoples' voices are to be expressed through their elected \nrepresentatives.\n  All Senators and Representatives stand for election and are \nresponsible to the people of their States or districts.\n  The President is accountable to the entire Nation and must face the \npeople in every State.\n  The Justices of the Supreme Court never have to face voters.\n  That is why the framers gave the legislative powers to the Congress.\n  And that is why they gave the administrative powers to the President.\n  We--who make policy decisions--are accountable to the voters.\n  The Justices of the Supreme Court are not.\n  At its simplest--that is what is meant by the rule of law. We are a \nNation of laws--starting with the most basic law, the Constitution.\n  The Constitution spells out the roles of the branches of Government.\n  It sets out the role to the courts--which is to settle legal disputes \nbetween parties, and not to set national policy.\n  The Supreme Court is also to be a last check on the legislative and \nexecutive branches when they clearly violate the Constitution--but not \nto override policy decisions when the Constitution is silent.\n  Judge Alito has a demonstrated record of respecting the rule of law \nand the will of the people through their elected representatives.\n  That disturbs some who belong to this body.\n  It bothers them to know that if Judge Alito and others like him are \non the Supreme Court--then the steady advance of courts acting as a \npolicy-making branch of government will be halted.\n  Judge Alito has shown respect for the rule of law throughout his \ncareer on the bench--and even before that when serving in the Reagan \nAdministration.\n  He understands that each branch of government has a unique role to \nplay.\n  And he understands that only two are accountable to the people.\n  I take great comfort in Judge Alito's understanding that there is a \nplace in our system of government for policy making--and that the place \nis not the courts.\n  Many of Judge Alito's opponents view the courts as just another \npolicy making branch of government.\n  In other countries that may be true. But in the United States it is \nnot.\n  Our judges are insulated from public pressure.\n  It is this way so that they can make impartial and fair judgments on \ncases--no matter how popular or unpopular the result.\n\n[[Page S62]]\n\n  They are also insulated from the political process to prevent undue \ninfluence from Congress or the President.\n  Does anyone here actually believe the framers of our Constitution \ninsulated judges so they could enact policies without any political \nconsequence?\n  In fact, the framers rejected proposals to give the courts any \npolicy-making powers.\n  But that is not good enough for some who oppose Judge Alito.\n  They want judges who will make broad policy decrees from the bench.\n  They want liberal judges who will rule by dictating policies that \nfail at the ballot box.\n  They want activist judges. And Judge Alito is not an activist judge.\n  Judge Alito will stand up to the activists on the Supreme Court and \nhelp make sure the Court follows its proper and vital role.\n  The confidence of the citizens in the courts is harmed when the \ncourts overstep their bounds.\n  Like Chief Justice Roberts, I am confident Judge Alito will only act \nwithin the Supreme Court's proper role.\n  And I am confident he will help restore the American people's faith \nin our court system.\n  I press upon my colleagues to support this nomination.\n  I will vote for Judge Alito and whatever measures and procedures \nnecessary to ensure he gets a final vote up or down.\n  I am proud to support him.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to support Judge Samuel \nAlito's confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States. Judge \nAlito's 15 years of experience on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals \nand his 15 years serving the Justice Department, including his position \nas U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey, make him well prepared \nto be an Associate Justice on our Highest Court.\n  One of the best insights into Judge Alito's judicial ability is \ngained from listening to his colleagues on the Third Circuit. \nColleagues from both sides of the political aisle praise him for his \njudicial excellence. Judge Aldisert, a nominee of President Lyndon \nJohnson, stated before the committee:\n\n       We who have heard his probing questions during oral \n     argument, we who have been privy to his wise and insightful \n     comments in our private decisional conferences, we who have \n     observed first hand his approach to decision-making and his \n     thoughtful judicial temperament and know his carefully \n     crafted opinions, we who are his colleagues are convinced \n     that he will also be a great Justice.\n\n  Moreover, after an exhaustive investigation, Mr. Steve Tober, \nchairman of the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, \ndeclared that Judge Alito's ``integrity, his professional competence \nand his judicial temperament are indeed found to be of the highest \nstandard.''\n  Mr. President, I have to say that anyone who watched Judge Alito at \nhis Senate hearing would agree that his professional competence and \njudicial temperament were certainly on display. I believe that showed \nvery well why he will be confirmed as a Supreme Court Justice.\n  The American Bar Association gave Judge Alito its highest rating. \nMost important, Judge Alito has a firm belief in the rule of law upon \nwhich our country is based. As he stated on the first day of his \nhearings, ``No person in this country, no matter how high or how \npowerful, is above the law, and no person is beneath the law.'' Judge \nAlito recognizes that, in our system, judges interpret the law, but \nshould not create policy. They should not decide what they would like \nto have the law be; rather, they simply should determine what the law \nstates.\n  He said on his second day of hearings:\n\n        . . . it is not our job to try to produce particular \n     results. We are not policymakers and we shouldn't be \n     implementing any sort of policy agenda or policy preferences \n     that we have.\n\n  During the 2004 Presidential campaign, President Bush made clear that \nhe planned to nominate to the bench judges who would respect the rule \nof law, judges who would interpret but not legislate. In particular, he \ndrew attention to his desire to nominate people who would strictly \ninterpret the Constitution. Knowing Supreme Court nominations were on \nthe horizon and knowing the President's views, the American people re-\nelected President Bush.\n  With the previous nomination of Chief Justice John Roberts and now \nwith the nomination of Judge Alito, the President is fulfilling his \npromise to the American people. Now it is time for the Senate to play \nits constitutional role in the nomination process to ensure the \nPresident's nominee meets the high standards we set for members of the \nSupreme Court of our land. Judge Alito is extremely capable, he is \nhighly qualified, and he deserves the support of this body.\n  I wish to also rebut one statement that was made earlier today. I \nbelieve Judge Alito was unfairly criticized for his opinion in Pirolli \nv. World Flavors, Inc. This was a case involving a mentally disabled \nman who claimed he was sexually harassed at work. They have alleged \nthat by ruling against the plaintiff in the appellate court, Judge \nAlito showed he is ``results-oriented.'' Their criticisms are unfair \nand misleading. Judge Alito was not even able to form an opinion on the \nmerits of the case because the plaintiff's lawyer presented an \nincomplete brief.\n  Judge Alito made clear in his dissent that had the plaintiff's lawyer \nraised the argument in a minimally adequate fashion, he might well \nagree and join the majority in voting to reverse. He continued to say:\n\n       I would overlook many technical violations of the Federal \n     Rules of Appellate Procedure and our local rules, but I do \n     not think it is too much to insist that Pirolli's brief at \n     least state the ground on which reversal is sought.\n\n  It is very important to understand that an appellate judge cannot \ncreate the facts. The appellate judge cannot argue the lawyer's case \nwhen he is not equipped with the facts or the reason for the request \nfor a reversal. So I believe it is important that we set the record \nstraight on that.\n  Judge Alito has shown by his manner during the hearing and his 15 \nyears on the bench that he is fully qualified under the constitutional \nrequirements and from every neutral observer with whom I have talked \nfor this position. I hope there will not be further delay.\n  I am so hopeful that the people who would vote against him would at \nleast let us have the vote. He has been thoroughly vetted. He has been \nthoroughly questioned. The Senate has fulfilled its constitutional \nresponsibility, and I think by the end of this week we should allow \nJudge Alito to be able to start preparing for the very important cases \nthat are going to come before the Court right away. Let him have the \nchance to be fully prepared and do the job we are asking him to do. It \nis the least we should expect of the Senate. It is the responsible \napproach for the U.S. Senate. The Supreme Court and the people of \nAmerica deserve no less.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for her \nremarks and her strong support of this very decent American and the \ncontinued leadership she exercises in our party and in our caucus.\n  We know that elections have consequences. When President Bush ran for \nreelection, he stated plainly and often that if given the opportunity, \nhe would nominate judges to the U.S. Supreme Court who strictly \ninterpret the Constitution of the United States. True to his promise, \nthe President nominated John Roberts to become the 18th Chief Justice \nof the United States. Just as true to his promise, he nominated Samuel \nAlito to serve as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.\n  I was pleased that President Bush nominated Judge Alito, as were many \nother Members of this body. I reserved final judgment, as most of us \ndid, until we saw the confirmation process proceed. I don't take the \nSenate's advice and consent role lightly. I didn't want to encourage a \nrush to judgment.\n  The hearings have occurred, and I believe Judge Alito has performed \nadmirably. There were 18 hours and 700 questions, and there probably \nwould have been a lot more questions if there\n\n[[Page S63]]\n\nhad not been the length of the questions, sometimes lasting as long as \na half hour.\n  Anyway, I believe he is worthy of our support. As has been stated \ntime after time on the floor, he earned the highest ratings of the \nAmerican Bar Association.\n  Let me tell you what impresses me, Mr. President, probably as much as \nanything else. It is the strong endorsement Judge Alito got from the \npeople who used to work for him. There is nobody who knows people \nbetter than those who work for you. There is a very impressive list of \nformer law clerks of Judge Alito writing to urge the Senate to confirm \nhim. As they state in their letter:\n\n       Our party affiliations and views on policy matters span the \n     political spectrum. We have worked for Members of Congress on \n     both sides of the aisle and have actively supported and \n     worked on behalf of Democratic, Republican, and Independent \n     candidates.\n\n  And they go on to say in their letter:\n\n       What unites us is our strong support for Judge Alito and \n     our deep belief that he will be an outstanding Supreme Court \n     Justice.\n\n  That impresses me, when the clerks, the people who work alongside \nthese judges every single day--and it is a very long list; it looks to \nme like there are 60 to 75 names on there--are all supporting him. As \nthey state, they are of all beliefs and party affiliations. There is no \nperson or persons who know a judge better than those who clerked for \nhim.\n  Finally, they go on to say:\n\n       It never once appeared to us that Judge Alito had prejudged \n     a case or ruled based on political ideology. To the contrary, \n     Judge Alito meticulously and diligently applied controlling \n     legal authority to the facts of each case after a full and \n     careful consideration of all relevant legal arguments. It is \n     our uniform experience that Judge Alito was guided by his \n     profound respect for the Constitution and the limited role of \n     the judicial branch.\n\n  That is what Judge Alito is all about from the people who know him \nbest, other than his family. Frankly, that has a significant effect on \nmy view of him.\n  I will make one other comment. We are dragging out this process for \nno good reason. We all know what the outcome of the vote is going to \nbe. We have other pressing business, including lobbying reform, which \nneeds to be taken up by this body. We have pending the issue of the \nPATRIOT Act. There are many issues we should be addressing and at least \nbeginning to work on, rather than dragging out this process. I wish my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle would see fit to bring this \nprocess to a close and let us vote on Judge Alito and move on to other \npressing issues.\n  The fact that there will probably be a large number of votes on that \nside of the aisle against Judge Alito doesn't upset me as much as it \nsaddens me. I didn't agree with the judicial philosophy of Justice \nBreyer or Justice Ginsburg. I knew that Justice Ginsburg worked for the \nACLU and held liberal views. But I also believe that elections have \nconsequences. The President of the United States--at that time, \nPresident Clinton--nominated them as his selection. There were very \nfew--a handful of votes against either Justice Breyer or Justice \nGinsburg.\n  When there is a large number of votes against this highly qualified \nindividual, it is a symptom of the rather bitter partisanship that \nexists in this body today, and I regret that very much. There are \npressing issues, such as Iran and their rapid acquisition of nuclear \nweapons, which spring to mind. We have to sit down in an atmosphere of \nmutual trust and respect and work on these things. I will be very sad \nwhen I see this large vote against this good and decent American, but, \nmore importantly, I will be upset because we continue to engage in the \nkind of partisanship which has even been ratcheted up lately on \nlobbying reform, when we should be working out a common approach and a \ncommon cure for a significant illness that afflicts this body and the \nCapitol today.\n  I hope we can finish this debate as soon as possible, vote on Judge \nAlito, and then move forward.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to pick up where Senator \nMcCain left off about the Alito nomination and what has changed between \nthe Clinton administration and the President Bush 2 administration \nregarding judges.\n  The question I ask the body and really the country is, have the \nqualifications changed or are the people President Bush has chosen to \nnominate for the Supreme Court more inferior in terms of \nqualifications, temperament, and character than the people President \nClinton nominated? As individuals, is there a major difference in their \nlegal experience? Are there any character flaws with these two nominees \nthat did not exist with President Clinton's nominees? If you can find \nan answer to the question other than no, I would like to hear about it. \nI would like someone to come to the floor and talk about how Justice \nRoberts and Judge Alito are not in the ball park as to qualifications, \ncharacter, and disposition with Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg.\n  It is clear to me that President Bush picked two very well qualified \npeople to serve on the Supreme Court when it came his time to choose a \nSupreme Court nominee. You don't have to take my word for it. Seven \njudges testified before the committee who served on the Third Circuit \nwith Judge Alito. They were nominated by Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, \nRonald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Bill Clinton, really a hodgepodge \nof nominees in terms of their source. These judges had a universal \nbelief regarding Judge Alito, and that belief was that he is a great \ncolleague, a good man, a judge's judge. They came before our committee \nto his defense.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record excerpts of these \njudges' comments.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Log Judges Testimony Talkers\n\n       Five sitting and two former judges from the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the 3rd Circuit testified on behalf of Judge \n     Samuel Alito's nomination to the Supreme Court.\n       The judges included nominees of Presidents Lyndon Johnson, \n     Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Bill \n     Clinton. Collectively they have served with Judge Alito for \n     more than 75 years, watching him work and evaluating his \n     intellect, character, independence, and judgment.\n       Judge Becker on working with Judge Alito up close: ``There \n     is an aspect of appellate judging that no one gets to see--no \n     one but the judges themselves: how they behave in conference \n     after oral argument, at which point the case is decided, and \n     which, I submit, is the most critically important phase of \n     the appellate judicial process. In hundreds of conferences, I \n     had never once heard Sam raise his voice, express anger or \n     sarcasm, or even try to proselytize. Rather, he expresses his \n     views in measured and temperate tones.''\n       Judge Becker on Judge Alito's intellect and open-\n     mindedness: ``Judge Alito's intellect is of a very high \n     order. He's brilliant, he's highly analytical and meticulous \n     and careful in his comments and his written work. He's a \n     wonderful partner in dialogue. He will think of things that \n     his colleagues have missed. He's not doctrinaire, but rather \n     is open to differing views and will often change his mind in \n     light of the views of a colleague.''\n       Judge Becker on whether Judge Alito is an ideologue: ``The \n     Sam Alito that I have sat with for 15 years is not an \n     ideologue. He's not a movement person, He's a real judge \n     deciding each case on the facts and the law, not on his \n     personal views, whatever they may be. He scrupulously adheres \n     to precedent. I have never seen him exhibit a bias against \n     any class of litigation or litigants. . . . His credo has \n     always been fairness.''\n       Chief Judge Scirica on Judge Alito's personal character: \n     ``Despite his extraordinary talents and accomplishments, \n     Judge Alito is modest and unassuming. His thoughtful and \n     inquiring mind, so evident in his opinions, is equally \n     evident in his personal relationships. He is concerned and \n     interested in the lives of those around him. He has an \n     impeccable work ethic, but he takes the time to be a \n     thoughtful friend to his colleagues. He treats everyone on \n     our court, and everyone on our court staff, with respect, \n     with dignity, and with compassion. He is committed to his \n     country and to his profession. But he is equally committed to \n     his family, his friends, and his community. He is an I \n     admirable judge and an admirable person.''\n       Chief Judge Scirica on Judge Alito's open-mindedness: \n     ``Like a good judge, he considers\n\n[[Page S64]]\n\n     and deliberates before drawing a conclusion. I have never \n     seen signs of a predetermined outcome or view, nor have I \n     seen him express impatience with litigants or with colleagues \n     with whom he may ultimately disagree. He is attentive and \n     respectful of all views and is keenly aware that judicial \n     decisions are not academic exercises but have far-reaching \n     consequences on people's lives.''\n       Judge Barry on Judge Alito's service as U.S. Attorney: \n     ``The tone of a United States Attorney's Office comes from \n     the top. The standard of excellence is set at the top. Samuel \n     Alito set a standard of excellence that was contagious--his \n     commitment to doing the right thing, never playing fast and \n     loose with the record, never taking a shortcut, his emphasis \n     on first-rate work, his fundamental decency.''\n       Judge Aldisert on Judge Alito's judicial independence: \n     ``Judicial independence is simply incompatible with political \n     loyalties, and Judge Alito's judicial record on our court \n     bears witness to this fundamental truth.''\n       Judge Aldisert on working with Judge Alito for 15 years: We \n     who have heard his probing questions during oral argument, \n     we who have been privy to his wise and insightful comments \n     in our private decisional conferences, we who have \n     observed at first hand his impartial approach to decision-\n     making and his thoughtful judicial temperament and know \n     his carefully crafted opinions, we who are his colleagues \n     are convinced that he will also be a great Justice.\n       Judge Garth on Judge Alito's lack of an agenda: ``I can \n     tell you with confidence that at no time during the 15 years \n     that Judge Alito has served with me and with our colleagues \n     on the court and the countless number of times that we have \n     sat together in private conference after hearing oral \n     argument, has he ever expressed anything that could be \n     described as an agenda. Nor has he ever expressed any \n     personal predilections about a case or an issue or a \n     principle that would affect his decisions.''\n       Judge Garth on Judge Alito's personality: ``Sam is and \n     always has been reserved, soft spoken and thoughtful. He is \n     also modest, and I would even say self-effacing. And these \n     are the characteristics I think of when I think of Sam's \n     personality. It is rare to find humility such as his in \n     someone of such extraordinary ability.''\n       Judge Gibbons on Judge Alito's independence from the \n     executive: ``The committee members should not think for a \n     moment that I support Judge Alito' s nomination because I'm a \n     dedicated defender of [the Bush] administration. On the \n     contrary, I and my firm have been litigating with that \n     administration for a number of years over its treatment of \n     detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and elsewhere. And we \n     are certainly chagrined at the position that is being taken \n     by the administration with respect to those detainees.\n       ``It seems not unlikely that one or more of the detainee \n     cases that we are handling will be before the Supreme Court \n     again. I do not know the views of Judge Alito respecting the \n     issues that may be presented in those cases. I would not ask \n     him. And if I did, he would not tell me. I'm confident, \n     however, that, as an able legal scholar and a fair-minded \n     Justice, he will give the arguments--legal and factual--that \n     may be presented on behalf of our clients careful and \n     thoughtful consideration, without any predisposition in favor \n     of the position of the executive branch.''\n       Judge Lewis on his own liberal politics: ``I am openly and \n     unapologetically pro-choice and always have been. I am \n     openly--and it's very well known--a committed human rights \n     and civil rights activist and am actively engaged in that \n     process as my time permits. . . . I am very, very much \n     involved in a number of endeavors that one who is familiar \n     with Judge Alito's background and experience may wonder--\n     `Well, why are you here today saying positive things about \n     his prospects as a Justice on the Supreme Court?' And the \n     reason is that having worked with him, I came to respect what \n     I think are the most important qualities for anyone who puts \n     on a robe, no matter what court they will serve on, but in \n     particular, the United States Supreme Court.''\n       Judge Lewis on Judge Alito's honesty and integrity: ``As \n     Judge Becker and others have alluded to, it is in conference, \n     after we have heard oral argument and are not propped up by \n     law clerks--we are alone as judges, discussing the cases--\n     that one really gets to know, gets a sense of the thinking of \n     our colleagues. And I cannot recall one instance during \n     conference or during any other experience that I had with \n     Judge Alito, but in particular during conference, when he \n     exhibited anything remotely resembling an ideological bent.''\n       Judge Lewis on Judge Alito and civil rights: ``If I \n     believed that Sam Alito might be hostile to civil rights as a \n     member of the United States Supreme Court, I guarantee you \n     that I would not be sitting here today. . . . My sense of \n     civil rights matters and how courts should approach them \n     jurisprudentially might be a little different. I believe in \n     being a little more aggressive in these areas. But I cannot \n     argue with a more restrained approach. As long as my argument \n     is going to be heard and respected, I know that I have a \n     chance. And I believe that Sam Alito will be the type of \n     Justice who will listen with an open mind and will not have \n     any agenda-driven or result-oriented approach.''\n       Judge Lewis on why he endorses Judge Alito: ``I am here as \n     a matter of principle and as a matter of my own commitment to \n     justice, to fairness, and my sense that Sam Alito is \n     uniformly qualified in all important respects to serve as a \n     Justice on the United States Supreme Court.''\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I have limited time, so I am not going to \nread them all. But I ask each Member of the body to look, if they can, \nat these short quotes, or if they want to listen to the whole \ntestimony, they can certainly retrieve it and ask the question of \nthemselves: Why would these judges from a variety of different \nphilosophies be coming before our committee and testifying on behalf of \nJudge Alito if he truly was an ideologue or out of the mainstream, if \nhe held positions on abortion or any other line of cases that were \nextreme in nature or outside the judicial mainstream of what a judge \nshould do?\n  Why would the American Bar Association, after looking at hundreds of \nopinions and thousands of cases in which Judge Alito participated, come \nto the conclusion that he is a judge's judge, that he has the \ntemperament, the disposition, and that there is no bias when you look \nat all the cases where he favors one class of Americans over another? \nWhy would so many law clerks, as Senator McCain mentioned, come to the \njudge's aid if he was a person who exhibited a hard heart, for lack of \na better way of saying it, a person who took the law and applied it to \nindividuals in this country coming before him in a statistical manner, \nnot a human manner?\n  I would argue that of all the records that have ever been amassed for \na nominee Judge Alito's record is on par with Ginsburg, Breyer, and \nanyone else who has ever been nominated, in terms of being highly \nqualified--15 years on the bench and a good person.\n  Those who know him best, those who work with him when the cameras are \nnot on and when nobody else is around all have the same view of Judge \nAlito: He is a good person who takes his job seriously. He follows the \nlaw, and he is conservative, but he is mainstream in terms of what we \nexpect a judge to be.\n  Who is in the mainstream in America when it comes to judging? And who \nis to determine what the mainstream is? If you would ask me to judge a \nDemocratic nominee as to whether they were in the mainstream of legal \nthought I would try to give you an honest answer. But if you wanted to \nask someone other than me--I am a Republican--I would probably \nunderstand why you want to ask somebody other than me.\n  How do we determine if a person is in the mainstream of being a \njudge? Rather than asking a politician, maybe we should go to a source \noutside the political moment, outside a political body, who believes \nthat this is a hugely important decision not only for the country but \nhas political consequences.\n  The reason this is an important political decision is because special \ninterest groups are watching our every move. Millions of dollars have \nbeen spent on advertising for and against Judge Alito. There are groups \nout there that have made it their reason for existing to deny this man \na vote or to defeat him. There are groups out there that are bent on \nsupporting him.\n  What do nonpolitical people say? What do people who have no political \nax to grind say? What do the people who have sat with him a decade plus \nsay, his fellow judges, African-American judges? They say he is not an \nideologue, that he is a good judge.\n  What does the American Bar Association say? That he has a \ntemperament--over 2,000 people were interviewed, I think it was; some \namazing amount of interviews conducted--a temperament beyond question; \nthat he approaches each case without a bias, but he tries to find the \nbest he can, looking through his philosophy of judging, to get the \nright answer. Those who worked with him as a prosecutor, who have been \nhis clerks, all have nothing but admiration for this man.\n  So why will he get, at best, five or six Democratic votes? Why did \nJustice Ginsburg get 96 votes? I would argue she deserved 96 votes, but \nshe was no better qualified than Judge Alito. The same things that were \nsaid about Justice Ginsburg, in terms of her temperament and her legal \nabilities, are being said about Judge Alito.\n  Politics has changed. Some members of our committee openly said \nthings are different now than they were then. This is replacing Justice \nO'Connor. The\n\n[[Page S65]]\n\ncountry is more divided. All I can say is, don't start down a road that \nyou will regret because Justice Ginsburg replaced Justice White, and if \nwe are going to base our vote on Roe v. Wade, what somebody might do, \nthen a pro-life Senator would have a very difficult time casting a vote \nfor Justice Ginsburg because she openly embraced a constitutional right \nto abortion and supported public funding of abortion. That is a view \nheld by many Americans. It is a legitimate view to have. But from a \npro-life point of view, it was clear that she was going to probably be \ndifferent than Justice White because Justice White dissented in Roe v. \nWade.\n  If that is the only reason you were voting for Justice Ginsburg, you \nknew with a high degree of certainty the balance of power on the Court \nwould change when it came to that one issue.\n  Somehow back then people of a pro-life persuasion set that aside and \nlooked at her qualifications. She was never attacked, that I can find \nin the Record, for being the general counsel for the American Civil \nLiberties Union, a left of center organization, from a conservative's \npoint of view, that embraces many causes with which I personally \ndisagree. But people understood there was a difference between \nlawyering and judging.\n\n  I would argue forcefully that the unpopular cause needs the best \nlawyer. Instead of holding it against her for representing politically \nunpopular causes, causes with which I completely disagree, I would give \nher credit as a lawyer because the unpopular cause needs the best \nlawyers in the country. The more popular it is, the worse lawyer you \ncan have because you are likely to win.\n  Something has changed, and I would argue that change is being driven \nby the political moment, not by the record, and it has huge \nconsequences for this country.\n  The Presidency is a political office. To become President, you have \nto go through a lot--a lot of commercials are run and a lot of \nscrutiny. To become a Senator, you have to go through a lot--a lot of \ncommercials are run against you, and you go through a lot of scrutiny. \nWe sign up for the process knowing what we are getting into.\n  Traditionally, judges who come before the Senate, recommended by the \nPresident to the body, do not have to mount political campaigns and \nhave traditionally not been subject to political campaigns. The reason \nbeing there has to be one place in America where politics is parked at \nthe door. How many people want their case decided by a political judge? \nI don't; even if they agree with me I don't because that is dangerous. \nWe are running with warp speed toward a day when the judiciary is \npolitics in another form. There is plenty of blame to go around. I am \nnot saying the Republican Party is blameless, but when it comes to \nevaluating Supreme Court nominees, I would argue there has been a \nchange from President Clinton's term to the current time and that the \nmodel that Senator Hatch used with Justices Breyer and Ginsburg would \nbe a good model for your vote on qualifications and where you do not \ntake dissents and political attacks as the way to try to undermine the \nnominee.\n  I honestly challenge anyone in this body to say that in terms of \nlegal ability, legal experience, and personal character, there is a \ndime's worth of difference between Roberts, Alito, Ginsburg, and \nBreyer. There is not. The record in Judge Alito's case and in Judge \nRoberts' case shows beyond any doubt they are well-qualified lawyers \nwho have practiced before the Supreme Court, who have the admiration of \ntheir colleagues, their associates, and those they have opposed in \ncourt, and that they are without any doubt historically well-qualified \nnominees.\n  You can take a record and make it what you want to make it for \npolitical reasons. You can take anyone's life and snip and cut and cut \nand paste and make that life anything you want it to be in a 30-second \ncommercial. It can happen to me, it can happen to you, Mr. President, \nit can happen to any American because if you have been involved in the \nlaw as long as Judge Alito, you can cut and paste his life as a lawyer, \nas a judge, and as a person. I just ask that we reject the politics of \ncut and paste and we look at the entire record and the complete person.\n  If we look at the complete person, we find a good father, a good \nhusband, a good man who comes from a humble background and who has \nascended to the highest levels of the law known in our country. If we \nlook at his time as a judge, we will find someone respected by his \ncolleagues who is serious as a judge, who is analytical in his thought \nprocess, who is, by no means, an ideologue. If we step back, we see in \nJudge Alito one of the most qualified conservative judges in the land.\n  I end with this thought. Elections do matter. President Clinton \nearned the right from the American people to make two selections. He \npicked people of known liberal philosophy and inclination to be on the \nCourt. These are legitimate philosophies to embrace and to have. He \npicked extremely well-qualified people to be on the Court. They are on \nthe Court now with an overwhelming vote.\n  President Bush and his nominees have been treated differently. I \nworry more about the future of the judiciary than I worry about \nPresident Bush because his time will come and it will go. He may have \nanother pick. But what we are doing on his watch is going to forever \nchange the way the Senate relates to the judicial confirmation process \nif we don't watch it.\n  For someone such as Judge Alito to be rejected by 80 percent of the \nDemocratic caucus is not healthy for the country because, quite \nfrankly, he has earned a better showing than that. He has lived his \nlife well.\n  He has been a good judge. He is a good man. His record, his \ncolleagues, his associates, and everything he has done as a lawyer, \njudge, and person needs to be considered in its entirety--not for \npolitical ends for the moment.\n  This vote we are about to take in the next few days is going to \nchange the way the Senate works for a long time to come. My belief is \nit is going to change it for the worse.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, on behalf of the Democratic leader, I \nask unanimous consent that the hour of Democratic time be controlled as \nfollows: Mikulski, Clinton, and Kerry up to 20 minutes each, and \nSenator Nelson of Florida up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to voice my opinion on the \nnomination of Judge Alito. I view this process with enormous \nseriousness. It is not like a political campaign because the Supreme \nCourt is a lifetime appointment.\n  Senators are called upon to make two decisions that are irrevocable \nand irretrievable. One is the decision to go to war and put our troops \nin harm's way. A very serious decision. You can't say the next day, \nWhoops, I made a mistake. The other is the confirmation of a Justice of \nthe Supreme Court. When that person goes on the Court, he or she is \nthere for a lifetime unless they commit an impeachable offense.\n  This vote will have an immense impact on future generations. Judge \nAlito is 55 years old. We can presume that he will be blessed with good \nhealth and will serve if confirmed for at least another 20 years. He \nwill rule on thousands of cases, which themselves will be around for \ndecades after he has left the court. His decisions will affect the \nlives of virtually all Americans for generations.\n  This vote will have an immense impact because of who the judge is \nreplacing, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the very first female ever \nappointed to the Supreme Court. Wow. She has been a terrific Justice of \nthe Supreme Court, a historical figure indeed. She broke the glass \nceiling of the highest Court in our land to become the first female \njustice on the United States Supreme Court. She has been a true pioneer \nin helping to pave the way for women in the legal profession. Justice \nO'Connor's impact on women in America reached beyond being a mentor and \na role model. Because it is not only what she did for women--it was the \noutstanding Justice she was. She brought new perspectives to the Court, \na great intellectual ability, and she brought a strong sense of \nindependence. That is why I think she was picked by Ronald Reagan. She \nhas been squarely in the mainstream, and often a critical swing vote, \nwhich determined which way a key case was decided. She brought the\n\n[[Page S66]]\n\n``i'' word to the Court--not ego but intellectual rigor and integrity \nand independence. That is why she was such a key vote, and often her \nvote determined whether fundamental rights were protected or not often \ndepended on Justice O'Connor's vote.\n  When we pick the nominee to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, I \nhoped the President would have picked another woman. When he nominated \nHarriet Miers, I was shocked, stunned, and even repulsed by the \nvitriolic, vicious attack on Harriet Miers.\n  After Harriet Miers was withdrawn, who did they give us? Certainly, I \nthink in all of the United States of America there was a qualified \nwoman who could have been nominated to serve on the Court. It would \nhave been nice if we had taken the time to find one, but I don't know \nif they were really looking because if you seek you shall find.\n  Who did the President nominate? Judge Alito.\n  I want to be very clear at the outset: I am going to vote to oppose \nthe confirmation of Judge Alito, and I do so for a variety of reasons.\n  One, I don't know who the real Judge Alito is. Is he the Judge Alito \nwho, when he applied for a job at the Reagan Justice Department, \npandered to every right-wing cliche, message-driven focus group \nidentified cause, attack affirmative action, one person, one vote, and \nall of that? Is that the Judge Alito we will have serving on the \nSupreme Court? He says, No, I wrote that because I was applying for a \njob. Hey, what is he doing here right now in the confirmation process? \nHe is applying for a job.\n  The process has occurred in the public and transparent arena.\n  But who is he? Is he a so-called new, moderate, mainstream, ``Gee, I \nhave always been in the middle'' kind of guy or is he the person who \napplied to work at Reagan Justice Department whose writings validate \nhis pattern of thinking?\n  Judge Alito failed to answer too many questions during the \nconfirmation hearing. Judge Alito refused to clarify his views and his \nphilosophy. He has written many, many decisions as a Circuit Court \nJudge which are clearly out of the mainstream. He failed to clarify his \npositions on the constitutional right to privacy, other fundamental \nrights and settled law. It is also unclear if he will be able to keep \nhis strong personal views from influencing his decisions on the highest \ncourt of the land. In the end, Judge Alito failed to answer too many \nquestions; he appears to be out of the mainstream.\n\n  Let me tell you my criteria for deciding on a Justice--actually on \nany judge.\n  First, is the nominee competent? Judge Alito is competent. He has the \nhighest rating of the American Bar Association. I listen to them very \ncarefully because we consider them an important advisory group that \nweighs in to the Senate. I hope that same standard of looking to the \nAmerican Bar is applied to other nominees in the future.\n  Second, does he have the highest personal and professional integrity? \nPersonal integrity: I would say yes. By all accounts, he is an honest \nman. He pays his bills. His wife is devoted to him. He seems to have \nwonderful children.\n  Professional integrity: I have some flashing yellow lights here. One \nis the concern about how he says he is this fairminded person, always \nopen, doesn't believe in discrimination.\n  I am troubled by his past membership in that very conservative \nConcerned Alumni for Princeton which Senator Frist and other prominent \nPrinceton alumni repudiated. But Alito didn't. He boasted about his \nmembership when he applied with the Reagan administration. That was the \nsame group that didn't want women in Princeton; women weren't their \nkind. There are a lot of other decisions he ruled on as a judge against \npeople who ``just weren't our kind.'' He claims he doesn't remember \nthat he was a member of this group, but he used it to get a job. Now he \ndoesn't want to use it to get this job.\n  The third criterion I have is will the nominee protect core \nconstitutional values and guarantees that are central to our system of \ngovernment?\n  Based on his own statements and testimony at the hearings, I have \nserious doubts about safeguarding civil rights, the right to privacy, \nand equal protection of the law for all Americans. That is the bedrock \nof our democracy. We are left to wonder if he will protect fundamental \nrights--the right to be free from unnecessary Government intrusion. In \nthe hearings, he had many opportunities to let us know whether he would \nsecure those rights.\n  Then he didn't clear up uncertainties. He didn't clarify his record. \nHe didn't candidly and completely answer the key questions that would \ntell the American people where he stands on critical issues. With the \nhearings over I am still asking who is the real Judge Alito?\n  First, let's take the issue of civil rights. One of the most \nimportant civil rights is the right to vote. Yet Alito left me with \nserious doubts on what his true views are. When applying for a job in \nthe Reagan administration, Alito said he strongly disagreed with the \nWarren Court on legislative reapportionment which became the bedrock \nprinciple of one person, one vote. That Supreme Court decision changed \nthe face of America. It changed the face of how districts were drawn \nup, and made sure, therefore, that people truly could be represented in \nlegislative bodies.\n  He later said in the judiciary hearings that the one person, one vote \ndoctrine is settled law. But he couldn't explain why he wrote the other \nstatement on his job application or why his opposition to the Warren \nCourt's decisions inspired him to go to law school.\n  Another fundamental principle is the ability for an individual to go \nto court when his or her rights are violated. An open courthouse door \nis fundamental to our democracy. Yet Judge Alito's record is troubling. \nIn one case involving race discrimination, a woman sued her employer \nfor racial discrimination. Yet Judge Alito argued that the woman \nshouldn't be allowed to present her case to the jury. The majority \ndisagreed with Alito and allowed the woman to have her trial. In fact, \nthe majority stated if they had applied Alito's analysis Title VII of \nthe Civil Rights Act would have been eviscerated.\n  There are many other cases in the area of civil rights and race \nrelations I find troubling, that show Judge Alito is not a moderate or \na mainstream judge as he seem to suggest he was at the hearings.\n  Then there is this issue of unchecked Executive power. The Supreme \nCourt is the critical check on the other branches of government by \nmaking sure that the checks and balances in the Constitution are \nmaintained. Increasing Presidential power has been a hallmark of this \nadministration--not just the recent discovery about spying on Americans \nwithout warrants but also secret meetings with energy company CEOs, \npreventing disclosure of how executive decisions are made and so on.\n  When asked about whether or not this President could ignore laws \npassed by Congress, Alito would only say no one is above the law. That \nwas not an answer--that is an empty slogan. We want to know how he \nwould interpret the scope of executive branch power.\n  During his time on the bench, Judge Alito has been very deferential \nto the executive branch. His answers suggest he will continue to be. We \nneed a member of the Supreme Court who is part of the Court and not \npart of the executive branch. We can't afford to have the Supreme Court \nduck its responsibility to check the executive branch.\n  So I am troubled about his position. We are at a benchmark in our \nsociety and this is the time when we have to be very clear on the \nexecutive powers and prerogatives.\n  Then there is the right to privacy. In the area of the \nconstitutionally protected right of privacy, it is unclear what Judge \nAlito believes the Constitution protects. Again, I go back to the \nstatements he made when he applied to work in the Reagan \nadministration. He was 35 years old, so he wasn't some kid who wasn't \nsure about himself. He was exploring big theories and big ideas. He was \n35 years old. He was applying for a job at the Justice Department. You \nhave to be a pretty experienced professional to even think you are \nqualified to apply for a job at the Justice Department. He was \nseasoned, and he was experienced, but he also wrote in that application \nthat he was proud he would have argued that the Constitution does not \nprotect the right to an abortion.\n\n[[Page S67]]\n\n  Let me say these are his words, not Senator Mikulski's. Not only did \nhe take the position to eliminate the rights in Roe v. Wade, he thought \nit was important that he emphasized it in his job application.\n  Now at the hearings he presents a different view. The key question \nfor Judge Alito on the constitutionally protected right to privacy was \nwhether he considered Roe to be settled law.\n  Judge Roberts at his confirmation hearing said he believed Roe was \nsettled law. Repeatedly, Alito was also asked at the hearings if he \nconsidered Roe to be settled law and if he agreed with Judge Roberts. \nAlito refused to say. He repeatedly refused to answer how he would \nprotect the fundamental and explicit right of privacy--implicit right \nof privacy--in our Constitution. He himself refused to clarify his \nprevious dismissal of Roe v. Wade.\n  He refused to clarify also his position on why a woman should have to \nnotify her husband in order to get an abortion, a requirement Justice \nO'Connor ruled was clearly unconstitutional. Nor would he elaborate on \nwhat the right of privacy actually includes over and above reproductive \nrights.\n  What does it mean in general? Our Constitution is a living and \nbreathing document. Twenty years ago when we talked about the rights of \nprivacy, we didn't know about the Internet, we didn't know about data \nmining, we didn't know about the fact that we would have to have a \nnational debate on national security and the right to privacy. Was it \noverreaching? When does the U.S. Government become the Grim Reaper, or \nwhat do they need to do to protect us? These are real issues. They \nrequire real debate. They require independence in the judiciary to help \nset the boundaries and the parameters on what other branches of \ngovernment can and can't do.\n\n  Don't you as a citizen want to be protected, when going to a library \nto borrow a book, from somebody snooping on you? If a citizen checks \nout a paper or a book because you want to know what the enemies of the \nUnited States think about our way of life or philosophy, for example, \nyou check out books like ``Mein Kampf'' or ``Das Kapital'' because you \nwant to know what our enemies thought, so you could be prepared to \nrefute them with your own ideas on democracy, you don't want the \ngovernment spying on you. Yet, what happens if something gets triggered \nand something is sent over to the peepers at a Government agency about \nwhat you are reading.\n  Sure, we have to look out for terrorists, but should every book \nchecked out of a library trigger the government spying on you? Do you \nwant them listening while you talk to your girlfriend? Do you want them \nmonitoring you and what church you go to?\n  These are big questions we are facing as a nation. We need to have \nmindful judges who help set the appropriate parameters to protect \ncitizens against the predators in our society, to be sure our \nGovernment itself does not become a predator on the ordinary citizen's \nprivacy. These are big issues.\n  So we are left to ask, Where was Alito on the right to privacy? We do \nnot know. His answers and non-answers clearly suggest that he will not \nprotect this fundamental right. Issue after issue leaves me with great \nconcern.\n  One last area of concern I want to talk about is Judge Alito's \napparent predisposition to rule against ordinary Americans. I look at \nthe seat Judge Alito has been nominated to replace. It is a seat of \nmoderation. Justice O'Connor represented mainstream America. She \nunderstood as a justice for the highest court in the land that her \ndecisions impacted real people and their lives. Her decisions were not \nmade in the abstract. Judge Alito has stated he looks at the facts of \neach case. Yet time and time again his decisions show support for big \nbusiness, for the executive branch but not so much for everyday \nAmericans. A justice of the Supreme Court must be able see through \nabstractions and understand the role of the law in the lives of all \nAmericans not just the powerful and influential. A justice must make \nthe marble motto over the Supreme Court ``Equal Justice Under the Law'' \na reality for all Americans. That is also an important role for every \nSupreme Court justice. Judge Alito's opinions, writings and answers \nsuggest to me that he does not understand this role either.\n  I have given careful consideration to this nomination. I have \ncarefully watched the Judiciary Committee hearings. I may not be a \nmember of the Judiciary Committee, but I have paid close attention to \nthe hearings and watched them on C-SPAN. I went over his past writings, \nhis decisions as a judge and the testimony of others.\n  In the end, I have too many doubts about what Judge Alito will mean \non the Supreme Court, what he will mean for civil rights, our civil \nliberties, checks and balances on executive power, caused by what he \nsaid--and even more by what he refused to say. I am concerned he is out \nof the mainstream, that he is willing to say what he needs to say to \nget a job, that he is an ideologue and that his personal views will \ninfluence his decisions. It is not acceptable that Judge Alito has \nexplained that he either forgot why he wrote something or that his \nearly writings were simply for a job application. What he believes is \nwhat he is. It will shape the Supreme Court for the next 20 years.\n  After careful review of the record before the Senate, I have too many \ndoubts, too many unanswered questions. Doubts about his commitment to \nproviding access to courts for Americans, ensuring appropriate checks \nand balances among the three branches of government and the fundamental \nright to privacy. The Supreme Court nomination is too important a \ndecision to roll the dice; I am afraid I will come up with snake eyes. \nTherefore, when my name is called in the United States Senate for his \nnomination, I will vote no.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I associate myself with the eloquent \nremarks of the Senator from Maryland. Once again, she evidences the \nrare combination of high intellect, quick wit, and a savvy \nunderstanding of what is important to the people she represents.\n  The nomination of Judge Samuel A. Alito, Jr., to the Supreme Court of \nthe United States is a matter of great, even monumental, importance to \nall--to our children and to future generations of Americans.\n  I have spent a lot of time in my State over the last 2 weeks. I have \ntraveled from one end of it to the other, from Long Island to Buffalo. \nI have to say, Judge Alito's name is not on the lips of most of my \nconstituents. They want to talk to me about the complex and confusing \nMedicare prescription drug benefit. They want to ask about the culture \nof corruption that seems to have taken over Washington under the \nRepublican leadership. They have questions about their health care \nwhich is at risk, even if you are employed, or the pensions which seem \nto disappear with regularity these days. They are concerned about the \nday-to-day, bread-and-butter, table-top issues that we all live with.\n\n  I say this vote we are going to take in the Senate will end up having \na great deal to do with how they live their lives, with the balance of \npower within our country, with the quality of life and liberty and \npursuit of happiness available to Americans.\n  The Constitution commands the Senate provide the President with \nmeaningful advice and consent on judicial nominations. I take this \nconstitutional charge very seriously. I have carefully reviewed the \ncommittee's hearings and Judge Alito's extensive record. I have met \nwith the judge. I have spoken with people who have strong opinions on \nboth sides of this nomination. I have concluded I cannot give my \nconsent to his nomination to the Supreme Court.\n  The way I read American history is that the key to American progress \nhas been the ever-expanding circle of freedom and opportunity. That has \nbeen the common thread through all periods of our history--greater \nrights and greater responsibilities of citizenship and equality.\n  Each time we have made strides forward, there have been vocal voices \nof opposition. There have been those who have wanted to go back. At \nthose moments of profound importance to our\n\n[[Page S68]]\n\ncountry, the Federal courts have been the guardians of our liberties, \nhave stood on the side of greater freedom and opportunity.\n  We all know the famous cases cited as representing this forward march \nof progress: Brown v. Board of Education, which struck down the notion \nof separate but equal; Baker v. Carr, which invalidated discriminatory \nState voting apportionment schemes and paved the way for the concept of \none man, one vote; Griswold v. Connecticut, which recognized a right to \nprivacy in the Constitution; Roe v. Wade, which established that women \nhave a right to choose.\n  We need judges who will maintain that forward progress. Despite his \ndistinguished academic credentials, Judge Alito has not shown himself \nto be that kind of judge. He does not have the dedication to civil \nrights or women's rights or the right to privacy that I believe we need \nin the next Supreme Court Justice.\n  Time and again, when given the choice, he has voted to narrow the \ncircle, to restrict the rights Americans hold dear. Now is not the time \nto go backward.\n  Without the progress we have made in the past 230 years, without that \nexpansion of the circle of equality and freedom and opportunity, I \ncertainly would not be standing here, nor would a number of my \ncolleagues. There would be no opportunities for women in public life.\n  But mine is hardly the only example. Voting rights would be \nrestricted. Equal opportunities in education and in the workplace would \nnot exist. And none of us would have a constitutional right to privacy. \nSimply put, our Nation would not be what it is today.\n  Our greatest strength has always been our commitment, generation \nafter generation, with some fits and starts, to enlarging the circle of \nrights and equality. That great American commitment has made us a \nbeacon of freedom around the world. This nomination could well be the \ntipping point against constitutionally based freedoms and protections \nwe cherish as individuals and as a nation. I fear Judge Alito will roll \nback decades of progress and roll over when confronted with an \nadministration too willing to flaunt the rules and looking for a \nrubberstamp. The stakes could not be higher.\n  To be sure, Roe v. Wade is at risk, the privacy of Americans is at \nrisk, environmental safeguards, laws that protect workers from abuse or \nnegligence, laws even that keep machine guns off the streets--all these \nand many others are in peril.\n  I don't believe millions of Americans are aware of that yet. This \ndebate is carried on in Washington. It is at a high level of legalisms \nand debates about jurisprudence and the meaning of the Constitution. \nBut I am confident the Supreme Court will have a dramatic effect on our \nNation and on what we believe America stands for.\n  When I ran for the Senate, I told New Yorkers that I would only vote \nfor judges who would affirm constitutional precedents, such as Roe and \nBrown and other landmark achievements and expanding rights and the \nreach of equality for all Americans. This is about more than rhetoric. \nThis is very real. The American people are counting on us not to be a \nrubberstamp but counting on us to make sure the President's nominee \nwill not take us backward.\n  I also view this nomination through the prism of the Justice that \nJudge Alito will replace. I have not always agreed with Justice Sandra \nDay O'Connor. But she has shown, throughout her career of distinguished \nservice to the Court that one Justice makes a big difference. One \nJustice can protect our constitutional rights. Justice O'Connor is a \ntrue conservative, a mainstream jurist. She appreciated the \nadvancements we have made as a society because she lived them. Anyone \nwho has ever read her autobiography about this little cowgirl growing \nup on a ranch in Arizona, going off to school, eventually going to \nStanford Law School, graduating near the top of her class and being \nunable to find a job simply because she was a woman does not only \nintellectually understand why our history is about moving forward and \nremoving the obstacles to God-given human potential, she feels it. She \nunderstands it.\n  Time and time again, she showed she appreciated the advancements we \nhave made as a society. She has fought to ensure they continue. Her \nvote was often the defining vote on which key civil liberties and \nrights rested. She exercised it with care and independent judgment.\n  Any fair reading, in my view, of Judge Alito's record does not \ndemonstrate that same independence of judgment, nor does it illustrate \na grasp, either intellectual or emotional, of the day-to-day struggles \nthat tens of millions of Americans face. On the contrary, Judge Alito \nproudly announced his personal opposition to a woman's right to choose \nearly in his career in the now infamous 1985 job application for a \nposition in the Reagan administration. Although he has tried to \ndistance himself from the comments he made in that document, his time \non the bench shows an unapologetic effort to undermine the right to \nprivacy and a woman's right to choose.\n  I believe, and I have said so for many years, abortion should be \nsafe, it should be rare, but it should be legal. I understand it is a \ndifficult and even tragic choice for many women. It is a decision of \nconscience. Therefore, it should be a constitutionally protected \ndecision made not by the Government, not by the majority--whoever the \nmajority might be--but between a woman, her doctor, and her faith in \nGod.\n  Judge Alito does not share this view. And I think we can be certain \nthat, freed from the constraints of Supreme Court precedent, he will \nintensify his campaign to roll back these important privacy rights.\n  The extreme rightwing of the Republican Party was up in arms when \nPresident Bush nominated Harriet Miers to the Court to replace Justice \nO'Connor. It was quite a spectacle to see this good woman, who had \nrisen to the top of her profession in Texas--not, I would imagine, an \neasy place to be the president of a State bar and be the managing \npartner of a large law firm, but had done so by dint of hard work and \nintelligence--be turned on by members of her own party because they \ncould not be sure she would agree with them no matter what the facts or \ncircumstances. Their reaction to Judge Alito's nomination, in contrast, \nhas been enthusiastic, effusive, even ecstatic. Why? Because they know \nexactly what they are getting.\n  Judge Alito's constrained views have not been limited to issues of \nprivacy. While on the Third Circuit, he has rarely sided with \nindividuals seeking relief from discrimination on the basis of race, \nage, gender, or disability. In fact, in the vast majority of civil \nrights cases, Judge Alito has sided with those who would infringe on \nthe civil rights of Americans. For example, in several dissents, he has \ncalled for curtailing what is called title VII of the Civil Rights Act \nof 1964, the landmark statute prohibiting discrimination against women \nand minorities in the workplace.\n  These individual views, as manifested by his writings, his work in \nthe Government, and his opinions on the bench, are even more troubling \nbecause he seems to favor Executive power so much over the other \nbranches of Government. So I also fear he will not respect the system \nof checks and balances that our Founders so carefully set out in the \nConstitution. No one who has read the Federalist Papers or the debate \nthat our Founders had when constructing the Constitution or who \nunderstands the historical context in which our Declaration of \nIndependence and our Revolution occurred could underestimate the \nimportance they placed on having three truly independent and equal \nbranches of Government.\n  The Founders understood human nature. They got it. They knew that \nunchecked power would lead to abuses. And we have seen some of that \nright here in Washington over the last 5 years. They realized that we \nhad to check and balance against power centers in order to bring out \nthe better ``angels'' of our nature, but also to keep a watch on each \nother.\n  I do not believe, after reviewing Judge Alito's record, he \nunderstands or respects this central principle to the way America is \nset up. He has sought to expand the power and purview of the executive \nbranch at nearly every turn, while simultaneously stripping Congress of \nits authority and curtailing the rights enjoyed by private citizens. \nFor example, while working for the\n\n[[Page S69]]\n\nReagan administration, he made the argument that Cabinet officials who \nare charged with authorizing illegal wiretaps of Americans in this \ncountry should be entitled to absolute immunity. At a time when this \nPresident and his political party stand accused of political \noverreaching and abuse of power, we must demand from our judiciary a \nrespect for the proper role of each of our three branches of \nGovernment. But Judge Alito's excessive deference to Presidential \nauthority, coupled with his restrictive view of congressional \nauthority, tells me he does not have the proper reverence for \nseparation of powers.\n  What is worse is that in supporting the expansion of the reach of \nPresidential power, Judge Alito also holds a harshly limited view of \nwhat the Government can or should do to help ordinary Americans. Judge \nAlito said it all in 1986, when he was a young lawyer with the Reagan \nadministration. He wrote that in his estimation, it is not the role of \nthe Federal Government to protect the ``health, safety and welfare'' of \nthe American people. Well, I guess that explains the inept, slow, and \ndangerous response to Hurricane Katrina. If you are not responsible to \nprotect the health, safety, and welfare, why should you be held \naccountable when people suffer, when their Government leaves them \nneglected without any help?\n  Judge Alito has long advocated a limited congressional authority \nview. Now, if that were adhered to, it would undermine a whole host of \ncivil rights protections, health and safety regulations, standards for \nprotecting our air and water, food and drug quality regulations, laws \nregulating firearms as well as vital programs such as Social Security, \nMedicare, and Medicaid.\n  Since his appointment to the Third Circuit, Judge Alito has \naggressively sought to promote this theory of limited congressional \npower. In 1996, he voted to invalidate parts of our Federal gun laws, \narguing there was no evidence in the record to determine that Congress \nhad the power under the Constitution's commerce clause to enact \nlegislation that regulated the sale of machine guns. In another case, \nJudge Alito wrote an opinion striking down Congress's right to make a \nState agency comply with the Family and Medical Leave Act. And just 3 \nyears later, the Supreme Court, with a similar set of facts, reached \nprecisely the opposite conclusion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 more \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. In several criminal cases, Judge Alito has shown \nblatant disregard for a defendant's fundamental right to be tried by an \nimpartial jury--what any one of us would want if we or a loved one were \never in this position--chosen free of racial or gender prejudice. He \nhas also narrowly construed other constitutional criminal procedure \nprotections, arguing often in favor of granting law enforcement \nofficials the greatest of latitude to conduct unauthorized searches and \nseizures.\n  Judge Alito's opinions on these and many other topics remind us that \njudicial activism comes in many guises. Adopting an unnecessarily \nnarrow view of the Constitution or of our laws to reach a desired \noutcome is a form of judicial activism that is no less offensive than \nsubscribing to an overboard interpretation of the law in order to reach \na specific result.\n  Judge Alito, if confirmed, may hold a seat on the Supreme Court for a \ngeneration--long after this President has left office. Perhaps through \n8 to 10 Presidential elections, decades of progress would fall prey to \nhis radical ideology, jeopardizing not only civil rights, civil \nliberties, health and safety and environmental protections, but also \nfundamental rights such as the right to privacy. Our Federal Government \ncould be transformed into one where Congress is largely irrelevant and \nthe President is permitted to make up the rules as he goes. I do not \nbelieve Judge Alito's vision of that America is what our Founders \nintended for us. He would take us backward, when it has never been more \nimportant to move forward together.\n  I sincerely hope my concerns about Judge Alito are unfounded, but I \nsuspect they are not, and our children and grandchildren will pay the \nprice. He has not demonstrated a proper respect for the rule of law, \nour Constitution, and the principles, freedoms, rights, and privileges \nthat Americans hold most dear. I, therefore, cannot give my consent to \nhis confirmation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters written to \nSenators Specter and Leahy opposing this nomination be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              National Organization for Women,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 13, 2005.\n       Dear Senator, NOW is strongly opposed to the elevation of \n     Judge Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court of the United States, \n     and with every passing day more information appears that \n     reconfirms our opposition. We urge you to review his record, \n     writings and judicial philosophy and join us in opposing his \n     nomination.\n       Not only is NOW disappointed that President Bush has \n     proposed to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor with yet \n     another white male ultra-conservative, but we are deeply \n     disturbed by the twenty-year track record that places Judge \n     Alito on the far right of the judicial spectrum, especially \n     when it comes to women's and civil rights. If Samuel Alito is \n     confirmed by the U.S. Senate, many of our fundamental rights \n     will be at great risk and could well be lost entirely.\n       A bedrock principle for NOW is full Constitutional rights \n     for women and at the heart of that equality is self \n     determination for women when they deal with their \n     reproductive health care and childbearing decisions. When \n     applying for a position in the Reagan administration in 1985, \n     Alito stated he was ``particularly proud'' of his work on \n     cases arguing ``that the Constitution does not protect a \n     right to an abortion.'' A memo released later shows that \n     Alito told his boss that two pending cases provided an \n     ``opportunity to advance the goals of overruling Roe v. Wade \n     and, in the meantime, of mitigating its effects.'' These are \n     not the actions of someone simply trying to please his boss, \n     but proud convictions that we have no reason to believe have \n     altered in the past two decades.\n       Also troubling is his proud touting of his membership in a \n     conservative Princeton alumni group that complained about the \n     admission of women and the number of minority students on the \n     elite college campus. How will Judge Alito deal with \n     educational opportunity and Title IX? How will Judge Alito \n     deal with pay equity and workplace policies as well as \n     affirmative action and job benefit issues that \n     disproportionately affect women? How will Judge Alito deal \n     with challenges to federal legislation guaranteeing \n     disability rights, lesbian and gay rights, and freedom from \n     domestic and sexual violence? We believe he will rule on the \n     side of narrowing our freedoms and barring our redress in \n     court.\n       Please consider all of these issues as you review Samuel \n     Alito's fitness to serve on our highest court in the land. \n     Based on his record, he will not come down on the side of \n     fairness and equality for all. We ask that you vote against \n     his nomination.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                        Kim Gandy,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               Legal Momentum;\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 10, 2006.\n     Senator Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate\n       Chairman Specter and Senator Leahy: Legal Momentum, the \n     nation's oldest women's legal rights organization, opposes \n     the confirmation of Judge Samuel Alito as Associate Justice \n     to the Supreme Court of the United States. Throughout his \n     career he has pursued legal approaches that raise questions \n     about his ability to respect the balance of power between the \n     three branches of government. Judge Alito defers to agency \n     decisions in many settings, while showing skepticism toward \n     individual litigants' claims, appears to support a narrow \n     view of civil rights, prisoners' rights, and workers' rights, \n     appears willing to uphold legislative restrictions on the \n     right to privacy and is willing to limit congressional power \n     while showing excessive deference to the executive branch. \n     This agenda poses a danger to an inclusive society, and a \n     representative democracy with constitutionally required \n     checks and balances that serves the needs of the whole \n     electorate. The legacy of conservative centrist, Justice \n     Sandra Day O'Connor, deserves a replacement that does not \n     rule based on political considerations, but can fairly and \n     justly interpret the laws and Constitution of the United \n     States.\n       Judge Alito's available record reveals a judicial \n     philosophy that would undermine critical civil and privacy \n     rights and protections. In his public statements, he speaks \n     about the restrained role of judges. Put into practice, \n     however, these views translate into higher burdens for \n     plaintiffs seeking to vindicate their rights, deference to \n     states or institutional defendants and employers, and limits \n     on the ability of Congress to require certain conduct from \n     states. For example, Judge\n\n[[Page S70]]\n\n     Alito often favors a restrictive reading of the law, which \n     results in the narrowest interpretation of civil rights. \n     Thus, individuals may be unable to enjoy the full reach of \n     these protections at crucial times. Stressing the need for \n     judicial restraint and discouraging judges from legislating \n     from the bench, he has used these themes as a means to limit \n     access to the ability of individuals to have their day in \n     court. And, he frequently argues to constrain the power of \n     the courts and the power of Congress, with regard to binding \n     states. The end result is that individuals, courts, and \n     Congress have less ability to hold states accountable to \n     ensure compliance with the law and remedy legal violations.\n       Judge Alito has taken a very restrictive approach in \n     employment discrimination cases, resulting in few successes \n     for plaintiffs. In Bray v. Marriott, he would have let stand \n     an employer's decision not to promote an African American \n     female employee even though there was considerable evidence \n     of irregularities in the hiring and interview process. Judge \n     Alito argued in dissent that the employer's failure to follow \n     its own rules was not sufficient to prove discrimination \n     against the plaintiff. For him, the employer's argument that \n     the plaintiff was not the best qualified should have been \n     accepted at face value. In contrast, the majority concluded \n     there were enough questions about the employer's motives and \n     conduct to allow the plaintiff her day in court. Moreover, \n     the majority chided Judge Alito's analysis for effectively \n     eviscerating the antidiscrimination purposes of the law, by \n     accepting the employer's reasoning without adequate review to \n     determine whether racial bias influenced the hiring decision. \n     They stressed that what mattered was not whether the company \n     was seeking the ``best'' candidate, but ``whether a \n     reasonable factfinder could conclude that Bray was not deemed \n     the best because she is Black.'' In his fifteen years on the \n     bench, Judge Alito has almost never ruled for African-\n     American plaintiffs in employment discrimination cases. The \n     Supreme Court deserves a Justice that is willing to consider \n     the full circumstances of the case at hand, not deny \n     plaintiffs their right to be heard.\n       While Congress has made efforts to protect workers who need \n     time off work to care for a sick family member or to heal \n     from a long-term illness, Judge Alito would make it harder \n     for workers to challenge state employers for violating the \n     Family & Medical Leave Act. In Chittister v. Department of \n     Community and Economic Development, Judge Alito wrote for a \n     Third Circuit panel that the state of Pennsylvania was immune \n     from lawsuits by state workers alleging violations of the \n     FMLA's medical leave provisions. The decision effectively \n     insulated the state from FMLA, claims, and undermined the \n     ability of workers to access medical leave when needed. \n     Meanwhile, Justice O'Connor, who Judge Alito would \n     replace, voted to uphold a key provision of the Family and \n     Medical Leave Act. If the Supreme Court adopted Judge \n     Alito's views, millions of workers could lose their \n     ability to vindicate their rights under the Family & \n     Medical Leave Act.\n       Judge Alito's record strongly indicates that he would \n     question the constitutional right to privacy and undermine \n     existing Court precedent on the issue. In a 1985 job \n     application, he touted his work on Reagan Administration-era \n     cases which argued that the Constitution does not protect a \n     right to an abortion--a position with which he indicated he \n     personally agreed. In a memorandum discussing the strategy \n     for the government's amicus brief in a pending case involving \n     a Pennsylvania abortion regulation, he stressed the \n     importance of finding a way to give states maximum latitude \n     to adopt abortion restrictions to undermine, if not overrule, \n     Roe v. Wade. After leaving the Administration and becoming a \n     judge on the Third Circuit, he wrote a dissent in Planned \n     Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, arguing to \n     uphold burdensome restrictions and hurdles aimed at women \n     seeking an abortion. The Supreme Court ultimately rejected \n     his position, but he once again underscored a desire to place \n     new limits on a woman's ability to make her own reproductive \n     health decisions.\n       Judge Samuel Alito's rulings on Americans' privacy rights \n     extend even further his support for increased power for the \n     executive branch. As a lawyer in the Solicitor General's \n     Office in 1984, Alito wrote a memo supporting absolute \n     immunity from civil liability for cabinet officials who \n     authorized illegal wiretaps of Americans due to national \n     security concerns. Later, he co-authored a brief to the \n     Supreme Court in which the government argued for absolute \n     immunity--an argument rejected by the Supreme Court. In \n     contrast, Justice O'Connor, writing for an 8-1 majority in \n     the case of American-born detainee Yaser Esam Hamdi (Hamdi v. \n     Rumsfeld), in which the court ruled that an American citizen \n     seized overseas as an ``enemy combatant'' must be allowed to \n     challenge the factual basis of his or her detention, said the \n     Court has ``made clear that a state of war is not a blank \n     check for the president when it comes to the rights of the \n     nation's citizens.''\n       After becoming a judge, Alito wrote in several opinions \n     that would have extended the reach of search warrants for the \n     executive branch. In a dissenting opinion in Doe v. Groody, \n     he argued that police officers did not violate the \n     Constitution when they strip-searched a mother and her ten \n     year-old daughter, despite the fact that neither was named in \n     the search warrant. The majority opinion, written by now-\n     Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, asserted that \n     Judge Alito's position would effectively nullify the Fourth \n     Amendment's warrant requirement and ``transform the judicial \n     officer into little more than the cliche rubber stamp.'' In \n     another dissent, in Baker v. Monroe Twp., Judge Alito voted \n     to keep a jury from hearing whether a police supervisor \n     unlawfully allowed his officers to handcuff, hold at gunpoint \n     and search a woman and her teenage children who happened to \n     stop by to visit the home of a relative in the midst of a \n     search.\n       Alito's stance on executive branch powers is further \n     revealed in a Feb. 5, 1986 draft memo where he argued that \n     the White House should issue ``interpretive signing \n     statements'' when signing a bill into a law, and that courts \n     might be persuaded to consider this 'executive intent' \n     equally with legislative intent. The balance of power between \n     the three branches is imperiled when White House \n     interpretation is accorded equal weight with congressional \n     support.\n       In conclusion, Judge Alito has consistently articulated \n     legal opinions that are outside the mainstream, that \n     undermine legal protections against employment \n     discrimination, that distorts the law in favor of extending \n     power to the executive branch, and that resorts to judicial \n     activism, blatantly ignoring the clear intention of the \n     legislature to push his arch-conservative political agenda. \n     Therefore, we urge you to oppose his nomination to the U.S. \n     Supreme Court.\n       If you have any further questions, please contact Lisalyn \n     Jacobs at Legal Momentum, (202) 326-0040.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Lisalyn R.

Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman,\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Specter and Ranking Member Leahy: On behalf \n     of the YWCA USA, representing over 2 million women and girls \n     with 300 associations nationwide, I am writing to write to \n     express our opposition to the confirmation of Judge Samuel A. \n     Alito, Jr. to the Supreme Court of the United States. His \n     views are not consistent with the value of equality that our \n     country holds dear, nor are they consistent with the YWCA USA \n     mission of eliminating racism and empowering women. Over the \n     past 50 years the Supreme Court's jurisprudence has often \n     served to protect the fundamental constitutional rights of \n     all Americans. After closely examining his record, the YWCA \n     USA has concluded that if Judge Alito were to replace Justice \n     O'Connor on the Court, this protection would likely halt and \n     in fact reverse with regard to individual rights. Judge \n     Alito's record reveals a history of troubling decisions in \n     the areas of civil rights, civil liberties, and fundamental \n     freedoms. The YWCA USA is extremely concerned that the \n     confirmation of Judge Alito to the Supreme Court would be \n     harmful for women and people of color.\n       If Judge Alito were confirmed, he has the potential to \n     change the direction of the court and devastate the rights of \n     women. For example, in the landmark case Planned Parenthood \n     of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, Judge Alito concluded \n     that it was not an ``undue burden'' for a married woman \n     seeking an abortion to have to notify her husband, a position \n     that the Supreme Court later struck down. This case raises \n     key questions about whether, if confirmed to a seat on the \n     Supreme Court, Alito would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade. \n     Furthering the YWCA USA's concerns, about whether Judge Alito \n     would seek to strip away women's reproductive freedoms, are \n     his own words. As a lawyer in the Reagan administration, \n     Samuel Alito wrote, that he ``personally believed'' that \n     ``the Constitution does not protect a right to an abortion.'' \n     In addition, during his tenure with the Solicitor General's \n     Office he was one of the chief engineers of a multi-tiered, \n     strategy to reverse Roe V. Wade. Alito wrote that an amicus \n     brief in Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and \n     Gynecologists was an ``opportunity to advance the goals of \n     bringing about the eventual overruling of Roe v. Wade and, in \n     the meantime of mitigating its effects.'' While it is \n     impossible to know for certain how Alito would rule in a \n     particular case before the Supreme Court, these statements \n     along with Judge Alito's past opinions make it difficult to \n     believe that he would effectively uphold the fundamental \n     freedoms of women. The rights, health, and safety of women \n     are too important to the YWCA USA to justify this risk.\n       The YWCA USA is also concerned with Judge Alito's record on \n     civil rights and affirmative action. It is quite troubling \n     that Samuel Alito touts his work as a lawyer in the Reagan \n     administration opposing certain affirmative action programs \n     as something he Was ``particularly proud'' of. One example of \n     Alito's work against affirmative action during the Reagan \n     administration is the case of Local 28 of the Sheet Metal \n     Workers' International Association v. EEOC. Alito and the \n     Solicitor General's office argued that it was illegal for \n     courts to order remedies including\n\n[[Page S71]]\n\n     affirmative action even in cases of intentional, on-going and \n     ``egregious racial discrimination.'' Alito signed a brief \n     arguing the extraordinary theory that relief in Title VII \n     cases could be granted only to ``identifiable victims of \n     discrimination,'' contradicting an earlier view of the Equal \n     Employment Opportunity Council (EEOC) itself. The Supreme \n     Court rejected Alito's argument, stating that affirmative \n     action relief ``may be ordered by a court as a remedy for \n     past discrimination even though the beneficiaries may be non-\n     victims.'' Furthermore, in the 1970s and 1980s Alito was a \n     member of Concerned Alumni of Princeton (CAP), an \n     organization that actively sought to limit the number of \n     women and minorities accepted to the university. In contrast, \n     Justice O'Connor cast the decisive vote in Grutter v. \n     Bollinger, upholding affirmative action in higher education. \n     If Judge Alito's views on affirmative action were to replace \n     Justice O'Connor's on the Supreme Court, institutes \n     throughout the country would be harmed. Eliminating this \n     important tool for promoting diversity would deny \n     universities, workplaces and other organizations the \n     enlightenment provided by a greater variety of backgrounds.\n       In addition to a restrictive approach towards affirmative \n     action, Judge Alito's record strongly questions the \n     legitimacy of employment discrimination claims, and in a \n     number of instances, Judge Alito issued opinions that made it \n     far more difficult for victims of discrimination to get to \n     court and prove their cases. Again, this is an area where \n     Justice O'Connor has often been the swing vote in protecting \n     and advancing civil rights. In contrast, Alito has ruled \n     against three of every four people who claimed to have been \n     victims of discrimination.\n       In one such gender discrimination case, Sheridan v. E.I. \n     Dupont de Nemours, Alito was the sole dissenter in a 10-1 \n     decision; arguing that he would require victims of \n     discrimination to present much more evidence before they \n     would be entitled to take their case to trial. Were this \n     position adopted more broadly, it would make it much more \n     difficult for victims of discrimination to have their day in \n     court and remedy these actions of prejudice. In another \n     employment discrimination case, this one dealing with race, \n     Alito went even further than upping the level of evidence \n     needed for a trial stating that even if discrimination \n     occurred it may not be against the law. In Bray v. Marriott \n     Hotels, Ms. Bray, an African-American woman, applied for a \n     promotion but a white woman was hired for the job instead. \n     Her employer, Marriott, did not follow its own guidelines for \n     hiring and several of the key employees involved in the \n     process gave conflicting statements about how the decision to \n     hire the white woman was ultimately made. Judge Alito argued \n     in his dissent that it might not be illegal for an employer \n     to overlook a qualified person of color even if the \n     employer's belief that it had selected the `best' candidate \n     was the result of conscious racial bias.'' The majority \n     opinion responds to this analysis by noting that Title VII \n     would be eviscerated if the analysis were to halt where the \n     dissent suggests. In addition to the troubling interpretation \n     of Title VII, Alito's dissent demonstrates skepticism about \n     the legitimacy of discrimination claims. He closed his \n     dissent with the disturbing pronouncement that a percentage \n     of discrimination cases are manufactured by disgruntled \n     employees, rather than victims of discrimination. This shows \n     a lack of sensitivity about the on-going national problem of \n     discrimination in the workplace. In contrast to Judge Alito, \n     70% of Americans believe racism is a problem in the workplace \n     today. This again illustrates that Samuel Alito is out of \n     step with mainstream America in the area of discrimination.\n       Finally, it is important to look at the make-up of the \n     court. Given the role that Justice O'Connor plays on the \n     court, it is necessary to review Judge Alito not only on his \n     merits but also in the context of whom he will be replacing \n     on the bench. Justice O'Connor has added an important, \n     independent and unique voice to the Supreme Court. As the \n     first women to sit on the nation's highest court, she has \n     broken barriers for women not only by blazing a trail but \n     also by providing a voice and a vote on the Court for all \n     women. Indeed, time and again on those issues that affect \n     civil rights, and women's rights, including reproductive \n     freedoms, Justice O'Connor is the deciding fifth vote. \n     Numerous laws have been shaped and upheld by this 5 to 4 \n     margin. Thus it is important to evaluate not only if Judge \n     Alito is qualified to sit on the Supreme Court, but also if \n     he will protect and honor the legal and social legacy of the \n     woman he would be replacing.\n       The concern that Alito would overturn well-established \n     legal principles and social achievement in the areas of \n     women's rights and civil rights, that the YWCA has worked to \n     protect for almost 150 years, is too great to ignore. That is \n     what his record indicates and furthermore, during his \n     confirmation hearing he stated, ``If I'm confirmed . . . I'll \n     be the same person I was on the Court of Appeals.'' For these \n     reasons, the YWCA USA feels that Judge Alito's confirmation \n     to the Supreme Court would negatively impact the lives of \n     women and people of color and therefore is urging you to \n     reject the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to the United \n     States Supreme Court. Senators must stand up and protect the \n     rights of the people they represent by voting against Alito's \n     lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court. The nation has \n     come too far in the fight for equality and worked too hard to \n     protect the rights of all individuals.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Peggy Sanchez Mills,\n                                                     YWCA USA CEO.\n                                           American Association of\n\n\n                                             University Women,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 9, 2006.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chair, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: On behalf of the more than 100,000 \n     bipartisan members of the American Association of University \n     Women (AAUW), we write to express our opposition to the \n     confirmation of Third Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Samuel \n     A. Alito, Jr. to be associate justice of the United States \n     Supreme Court. As the Senate Judiciary Committee opens its \n     confirmation hearings today, you will be faced with critical \n     questions and, ultimately, a critical decision that will \n     affect the balance of the nation's highest court--which will \n     in turn impact the everyday lives of generations to come.\n       After a careful review of Judge Alito's record, including \n     15 years of appellate opinions, AAUW finds him to be a \n     troubling choice with red flags in areas critical to our \n     mission and membership, including workplace discrimination, \n     reproductive choice, and affirmative action. Judge Alito's \n     appellate judgments provide little reassurance that he would \n     apply the law in ways that would uphold fundamental civil and \n     women's rights precedents should he ascend to the highest \n     court in the land. Indeed, taken as a whole, his publicly \n     available record--both from his government service and his \n     tenure on the Third Circuit--illustrate a judicial philosophy \n     at odds with AAUW's Public Policy Program. For all these \n     reasons, AAUW has opposed the confirmation of Judge Alito to \n     the U.S. Supreme Court.\n       AAUW believes it is more important than ever to ensure the \n     moderate balance of the U.S. Supreme Court by confirming a \n     justice who reflects mainstream America. Decades of progress \n     for women and girls hang in the balance. Further, given that \n     Judge Alito has been nominated to replace the often-deciding \n     vote of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, this nomination has much \n     at stake. AAUW is concerned that the confirmation of a \n     potentially extremist justice would turn back the clock on \n     decades of progress for women and girls. Two key areas in \n     particular have led to AAUW's opposition to Judge Alito's \n     confirmation:\n       Equal opportunity and legal protections against \n     discrimination: Judge Alito has a troubling record on a range \n     of civil rights issues, revealing a philosophy that would \n     weaken workplace protections that are central to addressing \n     discrimination against women. A number of Judge Alito's \n     opinions would make it harder for employees to win their \n     suits or even get their case to trial. Judge Alito has also \n     demonstrated opposition towards affirmative action, dismissed \n     constitutional protections against sexual harassment in \n     schools, and aggressively sought to curb congressional \n     authority to legislate on issues such as family and medical \n     leave. In several of these cases, U.S. Supreme Court \n     decisions have later espoused views opposite to those put \n     forward by Judge Alito, showing him to be far outside the \n     mainstream.\n       Reproductive rights and approach to precedent: Judge Alito \n     has actively rejected a woman's constitutional right to \n     choose, supported limits on abortion, and consistently upheld \n     limits to this fundamental right. While Judge Alito has been \n     careful to stress the importance of stare decisis, his \n     recognition of the importance of precedent is not a predictor \n     that he would follow the principle if confirmed. As a member \n     of the nation's highest court, the obligation to follow \n     settled law is different. Since Judge Alito helped develop \n     the strategy for undermining women's reproductive rights, it \n     stands to reason that Roe v. Wade and related cases \n     maintaining the right to privacy could fall within the \n     exceptions Judge Alito has set for himself regarding \n     adherence to stare decisis.\n       As you know, the Senate has few constitutional duties more \n     significant than that of advising on and consenting to U.S. \n     Supreme Court nominations. AAUW believes you should confirm \n     only a nominee that exhibits the impartiality and \n     independence that are so critical to this third, co-equal \n     branch of our government.\n       No nominee is presumptively entitled to confirmation. After \n     a thoughtful review of his well-established judicial \n     philosophy, AAUW cannot conclude that Judge Samuel A. Alito, \n     Jr. is the appropriate choice for a lifetime position on the \n     U.S. Supreme Court. AAUW urges senators to reject Alito's \n     nomination and let their votes be a true measure of their \n     commitment to equity for women and girls.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Lisa M. Maatz,\n\n                                       Director, Public Policy and\n                                             Government Relations.\n\n[[Page S72]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                               National Council of\n\n\n                                        Women's Organizations,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 11, 2006.\n     Senator Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate.\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate.\n       Chairman Specter and Senator Leahy: The National Council of \n     Women's Organizations, the oldest and largest coalition of \n     the nation's women's groups, urges the Senate to reject the \n     nomination of Samuel Alito to the United States Supreme \n     Court. Judge Alito's extreme position on a range of issues, \n     including reproductive rights, workplace discrimination and \n     violence against women, make him the wrong choice to replace \n     retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.\n       In nominating Samuel Alito after Harriet Myers withdrew \n     from consideration, President Bush chose to put political \n     expediency ahead of the rights and well-being of this \n     nation's women and girls. Mr. Bush's right-wing base clamored \n     for rejection of Ms. Myers because, as conservative as she \n     is, they felt she was not 100 percent pure on their issues. \n     Samuel Alito, however, is apparently their man.\n       Judge Alito has a long record demonstrating hostility to \n     women's reproductive rights. In the 1980's, he repeatedly \n     advocated the overturning of Roe v. Wade. In the 1990's, as \n     an appellate judge, he argued to uphold a Pennsylvania \n     statute requiring women to notify their husbands before \n     having an abortion--a position rejected by Justice O'Connor's \n     5-4 opinion in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. Nowhere in his \n     writings, however, does he express any concern that the days \n     of back-alley abortions could return if women do not have \n     safe, legal means to terminate unwanted pregnancies. Nor have \n     we been able to find any statement of concern, in any of his \n     writings, for women's fundamental right to be in control of \n     their own reproductive health decisions.\n       Indeed, Judge Alito has even expressed hostility to \n     contraception. In 1985, as a Justice Department attorney, he \n     wrote that some forms of birth control are \n     ``abortifacients,'' and saw no constitutional problem with a \n     state law restricting women's access to them. Extreme anti-\n     abortion organizations have long argued that the IUD and some \n     birth control pills are ``abortifacients''--subject to the \n     same kinds of restrictions that may be placed on women's \n     access to abortion--because they may prevent a fertilized egg \n     from becoming implanted on the uterine wall. This view runs \n     counter to accepted medical understanding, which is that \n     pregnancy does not begin until after implantation. Yet it is \n     the view embraced by Samuel Alito.\n       Judge Alito's opinions demonstrate an abiding deference to \n     the powerful at the expense of ordinary people. He has \n     argued, in cases such as Sheridan v. DuPont and Bray v. \n     Marriott Hotels, for erecting higher and higher procedural \n     hurdles that would prevent victims of employment \n     discrimination from being able to present their case to a \n     jury. He argued, in Doe v. Groody, to uphold a police strip \n     search of a woman and her ten-year-old daughter even though \n     they were not named in the search warrant and were simply at \n     home when the house was searched. He ruled, on all but one \n     issue, against a female police officer who was subjected to \n     two years of pervasive sexual harassment in Robinson v. City \n     of Pittsburgh. He has repeatedly criticized affirmative \n     action policies, and struck down a school district's \n     affirmative action plan in Taxman v. Board of Education. He \n     ruled, in Chittister v. Dept. of Community and Economic \n     Development, that state governments did not have to comply \n     with provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act. Women \n     have fought hard over the last four decades, against \n     resistance, skepticism and backlash, to win fundamental \n     rights. If confirmed, Judge Alito will be in a position to \n     undermine our gains for generations to come. We urge you to \n     stand firm for women's rights and reject this nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n     Susan Scanlan,\n       Chair \n     Terry O'Neil,\n       Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   National Women's Law Center\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 9, 2006.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter, Chair,\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy, Ranking Member,\n     Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Specter and Senator Leahy: On behalf of the \n     National Women's Law Center, an organization that has worked \n     since 1972 to advance and protect women's legal rights, we \n     write to reiterate the Center's opposition to the nomination \n     of Samuel A. Alito, Jr. to the United States Supreme Court. \n     As a result of its extensive review of Judge Alito's record, \n     the Center has concluded that the confirmation of Judge Alito \n     to the Supreme Court would endanger core legal rights for \n     women, with profound and harmful consequences for women \n     across the country and for decades to come. This letter \n     summarizes the basis for the Center's conclusions, which are \n     set forth more fully in the Center's December 8, 2005 letter \n     and detailed report.\n       Judge Alito has worked to limit a woman's right to choose. \n     While in the Solicitor General's office, Alito urged the \n     government to file an amicus brief in Thornburgh v. American \n     College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in order to \n     ``advance the goals of bringing about the eventual overruling \n     of Roe v. Wade and, in the meantime, of mitigating its \n     effects.'' His memo argued in favor of upholding even the \n     most burdensome and dangerous barriers to abortion. Alito \n     then volunteered to work on the government's Thornburgh \n     brief, and researched and wrote key portions. The Court \n     rejected the brief's extreme positions--it struck down \n     dangerous burdens on the right to choose the brief had argued \n     to uphold, and it refused to overturn Roe v. Wade as the \n     brief had urged. In plain reference to his role in the \n     Thornburgh case, Alito later wrote: ``I am particularly proud \n     of my contributions in recent cases in which the government \n     has argued in the Supreme Court . . . that the Constitution \n     does not protect a right to an abortion.'' He wrote this in \n     an application for a promotion a few months after the \n     Thornburgh brief was filed.\n       Judge Alito's record on the Third Circuit reinforces the \n     concerns about his approach to the right to choose. In \n     Planned Parenthood v. Casey, he not only would have upheld a \n     law requiring married women to notify their husbands before \n     having an abortion, but took an approach to the law that \n     would eviscerate Roe v. Wade by upholding many dangerous \n     barriers to the right to choose. For example, he failed to \n     focus on women who would be hurt by the restrictions (such as \n     victims of domestic abuse), and would have given husbands the \n     same kind of control over their wives' most personal \n     decisions that parents have over their children. A \n     majority of the Supreme Court, in an opinion co-authored \n     by Justice O'Connor, soundly rejected his analysis.\n       Judge Alito has ruled to limit Congress's authority to \n     protect public safety and welfare. Judge Alito would have \n     struck down a federal law prohibiting the transfer and \n     possession of machine guns, arguing in a dissenting opinion \n     in United States v. Rybar that Congress did not have the \n     authority to enact the statute under the Commerce Clause of \n     the Constitution. Judge Alito's Third Circuit colleagues, and \n     eight other circuit courts to date, have disagreed with him. \n     In another case, Chittister v. Department of Community and \n     Economic Development, Judge Alito wrote an opinion that \n     barred state employees from suing for damages when their \n     employers violate their right to take medical leave under the \n     Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). A 6-3 majority of the \n     Supreme Court, including even Justice Rehnquist, subsequently \n     upheld another provision of the FMLA against a similar \n     challenge on the ground that the FMLA was enacted to address \n     sex discrimination in the workplace. Judge Alito gave short \n     shrift to this argument.\n       Judge Alito has ruled to make it more difficult for \n     plaintiffs to prove discrimination. Judge Alito's opinions in \n     employment discrimination cases raise significant concerns. \n     For example, he dissented from Sheridan v. E.I. DuPont De \n     Nemours and Company, a sex discrimination case in which all \n     10 of the other members of the Third Circuit joined in \n     reversing the trial court's rejection of a jury verdict for \n     the plaintiff. Judge Alito ignored applicable legal standards \n     to urge overturning the jury verdict, inappropriately \n     credited the employer's explanations for its actions, and, \n     standing in for the jury, downplayed the plaintiff's \n     evidence. Alito also dissented in Bray v. Marriott Hotels, a \n     race discrimination case, and again would have prevented the \n     plaintiff from bringing her case before a jury by giving the \n     employer the benefit of the doubt. The majority said that \n     under his approach to the evidence, ``Title VII [of the Civil \n     Rights Act of 1964] would be eviscerated.''\n       Judge Alito's publicly available record does not reveal his \n     views on the constitutional protection against sex \n     discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause of the \n     Fourteenth Amendment. But in his 1985 job application he \n     expressed support for at least some of the central legal \n     tenets of the Reagan Administration, and the Justice \n     Department under Attorney General Ed Meese favored the \n     ``originalist'' approach to constitutional interpretation \n     advocated by Robert Bork, which would permit almost any \n     gender-based distinctions in law or government policy. Judge \n     Alito's views in this area must be carefully explored at his \n     confirmation hearing.\n       Throughout his career, Judge Alito has taken positions and \n     issued rulings detrimental to women in other areas of the \n     law, including through his membership in an organization that \n     was openly hostile to the admission of women and minorities \n     to his alma mater, Princeton; his participation in cases \n     where the Solicitor General argued against affirmative action \n     policies; his vote to uphold a strip search of a woman and \n     her ten-year-old daughter, even though they were not named in \n     a search warrant, in Doe v. Groody, his opinion in Sabree v. \n     Richman strongly suggesting that if he were to join the \n     Supreme Court, he would change the law to limit, and \n     potentially preclude, the ability of individuals to enforce \n     federal rights such as rights to Medicaid, public housing, \n     child support enforcement, and public assistance; and his \n     denial of an asylum claim by an Iranian woman who asserted \n     that if she returned to Iran she would be persecuted for her \n     feminist beliefs.\n       This is a watershed moment for women's legal rights. In \n     recent years, the Supreme Court has decided cases affecting \n     women's legal rights by narrow margins. Justice Sandra Day \n     0'Connor, the first woman on the Supreme Court, often has \n     cast the decisive vote\n\n[[Page S73]]\n\n     in these cases. With the retirement of Justice O'Connor, the \n     Court will lose not only its first female Justice, but also \n     the Justice whose vote often has been pivotal on issues \n     critical to women. Judge Alito's record demonstrates that if \n     he is confirmed to the Supreme Court, he is likely to \n     eviscerate core rights that American women rely upon, and \n     shift the Court in a dangerous and harmful direction. Based \n     on the information available at this time, as summarized \n     above, we conclude that Judge Alito should not be confirmed \n     to the Supreme Court.\n           Sincerely,\n     Nancy Duff Campbell,\n     Marcia D. Greenberger, Co-President.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, obviously, today we face one of the most \nimportant choices we make as Senators. This is a choice, as colleagues \nhave said, that is going to affect the country for the next several \ndecades.\n  To replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the President has nominated a \nman who has consistently deferred to Government action regardless of \nhow egregious that action may be. He has nominated a man whose pattern \nof decisions erects rather than breaks down barriers in the area of \ncivil rights; a man who, to this day, has never retreated from his \ndeclaration that the Constitution does not protect a woman's right to \nprivacy; a man who has demonstrated a persistent insensitivity to the \nhistory of racial discrimination in this country and was even, at the \nGovernment's request, willing to ignore overwhelming evidence that \nAfrican Americans were intentionally stricken from an all-White jury in \na Black defendant's capital case.\n  Judge Alito has been nominated to fill the seat, as we know, of an \nindividual who has been the Court's swing vote; a woman who has upheld \naffirmative action programs; a woman who upheld the right to choose; a \nwoman who upheld State employees' rights to the protections of the \nFamily Medical Leave Act; a woman who recognizes that a declaration of \nwar is not a blank check for the President's actions; a woman who \ndecides each case narrowly on the facts presented, keenly aware of the \ngreater impact that her decisions have.\n  So this is the contrast. We are being asked to confirm a nominee who \nwill shift the ideological balance of the Court dramatically to the \nright. And many people are cheering for that.\n  We are being asked to confirm a nominee whose views will undermine a \nbalance of power that I believe, and many others believe, literally \nkeeps our country strong, a balance of power that helps to bring people \ntogether rather than divide them, that helps to apply the Constitution \nto people in all walks of life, not simply those with power and \nprivilege.\n  For the reasons of this track record: the of his writings in the \nJustice Department, the questions unanswered in the hearings, the cases \nhe has decided, where studies have shown a pattern of willingness to \nignore our Constitutional rights and deny people access to our court \nsystem, for all of these and for other compelling reasons, I oppose \nthis nomination.\n  In the past, in the 22 years I have been here, like many of my \ncolleagues, I have voted for Federal court nominees despite the fact I \ndisagreed with them ideologically. I have voted, I am confident, \nliterally hundreds of times. In fact, I voted for Justice Scalia \nbecause despite our ideological differences, in the confirmation \nprocess he promised to be openmindedness that we have not seen in the \nCourt.\n  So we have learned the hard way. The words of the confirmation \nhearings simply do not erase ideology, they do not erase a track \nrecord. And that ideology cannot be overlooked because a Justice's \ndecisions can and will have a profound impact on the rights that we \notherwise take for granted.\n  So something more is needed. A Supreme Court Justice needs to \nunderstand and have a record of respecting the constitutional rights \nand liberties which we confirm them to uphold. He or she needs to \nrecognize the importance of precedent and the limited situations in \nwhich overruling is acceptable.\n  He or she needs to appreciate the significant struggles that our \nNation has endured in the context of racial, sexual, and disability \ndiscrimination and to be aware of the road still to be traveled. And \nthat awareness of the road still to be traveled has to be evidenced in \nthe decisions and writings of that nominee. In short, ideology does \nmatter. The Supreme Court's ideologically driven decisions have been \nthe most regrettable in our Nation's history, decisions such as \nKorematsu, Dred Scott, and Plessy v. Ferguson.\n  In fact, ideology matters more in this nomination than it would in \nmany others. We are replacing Sandra Day O'Connor, President Reagan's \nnominee to the Supreme Court, the person who has occupied the center of \nbalance on the Court. She has been the deciding vote in critical cases \ninvolving and defining our constitutional rights and liberties. As we \ncontemplate ripping that center out from under the Court, we have to \nunderstand what the impact of that action will be.\n  Given how high the stakes are, our decision simply cannot be based on \nwhether Judge Alito is a smart man or whether he is a nice man or \nwhether he is an accomplished man or even whether he is well respected \nin legal circles. He is all of those things. But what we need to \nconsider is the impact that a Justice Alito will have on the Court and \nwhether that impact is good for our country, good for our Constitution, \nand good for the American people.\n  I believe, based on his track record, the decisions already made, the \nwritings already expressed, the questions that went un-answered, that \nthe he will have a detrimental effect. President Bush had the \nopportunity to nominate someone who would have united the country. He \ncould have nominated somebody who would have received 100 votes or 98 \nvotes. He chose not to do this, which is his right. We all understand. \nWe have heard the argument about the consequence of elections. The fact \nis, he chose not to do that.\n  The way in which this nomination came to us in the Senate tells us a \nhuge amount what this nomination really means. The President was under \nfire from his conservative base for nominating Harriet Miers, a woman \nwhose judicial philosophy was unmercifully attacked. President Bush, in \nthe end, broke to those extreme rightwing demands. This was an \nideological coup. Miers was removed and Alito was installed. The \nPresident didn't consult with the Senate, as required by the \nConstitution. He gave more thought to what the political needs were \nthan to what the country's needs were. Indeed, he made this nomination \nabout his political base. He made it about an ideological shift in the \nCourt. He made it about unassailable conservative credentials and an \nunimpeachable conservative judicial philosophy.\n  If you want proof of that, all you have to do is look at the comments \nof people such as Ms. Ann Coulter. We all know Ms. Coulter is capable \nof being as inflammatory and conservative as anyone in the country, \noften engaging in character assassination. She denounced the nomination \nof John Roberts. She attacked the nomination of Harriet Miers, calling \nher completely unqualified and lamenting that President Bush had \n``thrown away a Supreme Court seat.'' Yet she celebrated the nomination \nof Sam Alito, stating that Bush gave the Democrats a ``right hook'' \nwith this ``stunningly qualified'' nominee. This from a woman who said \nthat the Republicans need to nominate a person who ``wake[s] up every \nmorning . . . chortling about how much his latest opinion will tick off \nthe left.''\n  Failed Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork had a similar reaction. He \ndenounced the Miers nomination as ``taking the heart out of a rising \ngeneration'' of conservative constitutional scholars and ``widen[ing] \nthe fissures within the conservative movement.'' Yet he praised Alito's \nnomination as ``substantially narrowing'' that rift. In fact, he called \nthe nomination something to ``rejoice'' because if Alito were \nconfirmed, it would only take ``one more Justice of the Roberts-Scalia-\nThomas-Alito stripe to return the Court to so-called jurisprudential \nrespectability.''\n  Let's not forget conservative stalwart Pat Buchanan who denounced the \nMiers nomination as revealing the President's lack of desire ``to \nengage the Senate in fierce combat to carry out his now suspect \ncommitment to remake the Court in the image of Scalia\n\n[[Page S74]]\n\nand Thomas.'' Apparently, Mr. Buchanan believes that the Alito \nnomination demonstrates the President's change of heart. He heralded \nthe nomination as one that would unite and rally the base, a nomination \nfor the base, not the country.\n  They say you can tell a lot by somebody's friends. These three \nindividuals are consistently on the furthest edge of the ideological \nspectrum. Their positions rarely advance the interests of average \nworking folk in America. So perhaps it should come as no surprise that \nthese folks have jumped to support Judge Alito.\n  After reviewing more than 400 of Judge Alito's opinions, law school \nprofessors at Yale concluded:\n\n       In the area of civil rights law, Judge Alito consistently \n     has used procedural and evidentiary standards to rule against \n     female, minority, age, and disability claimants. . . . Judge \n     Alito seems relatively willing to defer to the claims of \n     employers and the government over those of advancing civil \n     rights claims.\n\n  Similarly, a Knight Ridder review of Judge Alito's opinions concluded \nthat Judge Alito ``has worked quietly but resolutely to weave a \nconservative legal agenda into the fabric of the Nation's laws'' and \nthat he ``seldom sided with a criminal defendant, a foreign national \nfacing deportation, an employee alleging discrimination, or consumers \nsuing big business.''\n  After reviewing 221 of Judge Alito's opinions in divided cases, the \nWashington Post concluded that Judge Alito is ``clearly tough minded . \n. . having very little sympathy for those asserting rights against the \ngovernment.'' The pattern is clear, and I think it is unacceptable.\n  I don't think you should put somebody on the Court who makes access \nto justice in the United States harder and more elusive for people who \nalready face incredible obstacles when trying to have their voices \nheard in court. I don't think we should put somebody on the Court who \nwill fail to serve as an effective check on excessive Executive power.\n\n  If this pattern is not enough, as has been described by others, then \nall we to have to do is look at some individual cases. In Sheridan v. \nE.I. duPont De Nemours and Company, Judge Alito wrote a lone dissent \nopposed by all of the other judges on the court, eight of whom were \nRepublicans. His opinion would have made it more difficult for victims \nof discrimination to sue their employers.\n  Applying a similarly high standard of proof, one that the majority \nbelieved would eviscerate the protections of title VII, Judge Alito \ndissented from a decision to allow a racial discrimination claim to go \nto trial in Bray v. Marriott Hotels.\n  These are all cases where people were trying to have their rights \nadjudicated, and disagreeing with his colleagues, including Republican-\nappointed judges, Judge Alito said no.\n  What is the practical impact of these decisions? Simple: They keep \nvictims of discrimination from having their day in court.\n  If it is not enough to see this kind of insensitivity toward the \nvictims of discrimination evidenced in those judicial opinions, in his \n1985 job application to President Reagan's Justice Department, Judge \nAlito wrote that his interest in constitutional law was driven in part \nby a disagreement with Warren Court decisions on reapportionment, \ndecisions which established the principle of one person, one vote. And \nhe said that he was ``particularly proud'' of his work to end \naffirmative action programs.\n  Judge Alito's hostility to individual rights isn't limited to civil \nrights. He consistently excuses government intrusions into personal \nprivacy, regardless of how egregious or excessive they are. In Doe v. \nGroody, for example, he dissented from an opinion written by then-Judge \nMichael Chertoff because he believed that the strip search of a 10-\nyear-old was reasonable. He also thought the Government should not be \nheld accountable for shooting an unarmed boy who was trying to escape \nwith a stolen purse or even for forcibly evicting farmers from their \nland in a civil bankruptcy proceeding where there was no show of \nresistance from those farmers. He believed a show of force from the \nenforcers was reasonable.\n  This pattern of deference to power is reinforced by a speech he gave \nas a sitting judge to the Federalist Society just 5 years ago.\n  In that speech, Judge Alito ``preached the gospel'' of the Reagan \nadministration's Justice Department, the theory of a unitary executive. \nAnd though in the hearings Judge Alito attempted to downplay the \nsignificance of this theory by saying it didn't address the scope of \nthe power of the executive branch but, rather, addressed the question \nof who controls the executive branch, don't be fooled. The unitary \nexecutive theory has everything to do with the scope of Executive \npower.\n  In fact, even Stephen Calabresi, one of the fathers of the theory, \nhas stated that ``[t]he practical consequences of the theory are \ndramatic. It renders unconstitutional independent agencies and \ncouncils.'' That means that Congress would lose the power to protect \npublic safety by creating agencies like the Consumer Products \nCommission, which ensures the safety of products on the marketplace, or \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission which protects Americans from \ncorporations such as Enron. And who would gain the power? The \nExecutive, the President.\n  Carried to its logical end, the theory goes much further than simply \ninvalidating independent agencies. The Bush administration has already \nused this theory to justify its illegal domestic spying program and its \nability to torture detainees. The administration seems to view this \ntheory as a blank check for Executive overreaching.\n  Judge Alito's endorsement of the unitary executive theory is not the \nonly cause for concern. In 1986, while working at the Justice \nDepartment, he endorsed the idea that Presidential signing statements \ncould be used to influence judicial interpretation of legislation. His \npremise was that the President's understanding of legislation is just \nas important in determining legislative intent as Congress's, which is \nabsolutely startling when you look at the history of legislative intent \nand of the legislative branch itself. President Bush has taken the \npractice of issuing signing statements to an extraordinarily new level. \nMost recently, he used a signing statement to reserve the right to \nignore the ban on torture that Congress overwhelmingly passed. He also \nused signing statements to attempt to apply the law restricting habeas \ncorpus review of enemy combatants retroactively, despite our \nunderstanding in Congress that it would not affect cases pending before \nthe Supreme Court at the time of passage.\n  The signing statements have been used to specifically negate or make \nan end run around very specific congressional intent. The implication \nof President Bush's signing statements are absolutely astounding. His \nadministration is reserving the right to ignore those laws it doesn't \nlike. Only one thing can hold this President accountable, and it is \ncalled the Supreme Court. Given Judge Alito's endorsement of the \nunitary executive and his consistent deference to government power, I \ndon't think Judge Alito is prepared to be the kind of check we need. \nReining in excessive government power matters more today to the average \nAmerican than perhaps at any recent time in our memory, as we work to \ntry to provide a balance between protecting our rights and our safety. \nAs Justice O'Connor said: The war on terror is not a blank slate for \ngovernment action. We can and must fight that in a manner consistent \nwith our Constitution.\n  Last but certainly not least, I have grave concerns about Judge \nAlito's ability and willingness to protect a woman's right to choose. \nIn his 1985 job application, Judge Alito wrote that he was \n``particularly proud'' of his work arguing before the Supreme Court \nthat ``the Constitution does not protect a right to abortion.'' Now, \nall of us know this is an extraordinarily complicated issue. I don't \nknow anybody here who is pro-abortion. But we are in favor of the right \nof people individually to make that choice for themselves rather than \nhaving the Government make that choice for them. And, the fact is that \nthe Constitution protects that right.\n\n  Yet, in 1985, Judge Alito wrote a memo outlining a strategy for \nchipping away at Roe v. Wade, an approach he believed would be more \nsuccessful than asking for an outright reversal. In his\n\n[[Page S75]]\n\nhearings, Judge Alito stated these statements were accurate reflections \nof his views in 1985. But what is more disturbing is what he refused to \nsay. He refused to say his views have changed, that he accepted Roe v. \nWade as settled law, which even Chief Justice Roberts did during his \nconfirmation hearings. In other words, Judge Alito refused to give any \nassurances that his concept of the Constitution's protected liberty is \nconsistent with mainstream America's.\n  I realize Judge Alito has promised he is going to keep an open mind, \nbut I don't think any of us can be reassured by those words. We heard \nthose very same words before. Justice Thomas repeatedly told the \nJudiciary Committee he would keep an open mind on this issue. But we \nall know that once safely on the Supreme Court, Justice Thomas voted to \noverturn Roe v. Wade months later, writing a dissent in Casey that \nlikened abortion to polygamy, sodomy, incest, and suicide. Given \nJustice Thomas's success, you can almost imagine Karl Rove whispering \nto Judge Alito: Just say you have an open mind; say whatever it takes.\n  We cannot rely on these empty platitudes, and we obviously cannot \nrely on any promises of open-mindedness given to the Judiciary \nCommittee, particularly when they are absent an acknowledgment of what \nis or what is not a settled law, particularly when the nominee's entire \nprofessional history suggests something very different, and \nparticularly when the past promises of that very nominee have already \nbeen rendered meaningless by his actions once safely on the bench. In \nJudge Alito's 1990 Judiciary Committee hearings, he promised that he \nwould recuse himself in any cases involving the Vanguard Company given \nhis ownership of Vanguard mutual funds. In his Supreme Court hearings, \nhe admitted he could not remember having put Vanguard on his permanent \nrecusal list. We know it did not appear on his 1993, 1994, 1995, or \n1996 list. So how do we know he kept his word to the Judiciary \nCommittee? We don't. How can we trust him now? We can't.\n  I am deeply concerned about where we are heading with this \nideological choice for the Court. I am deeply concerned about \nmaintaining the integrity of our constitutional rights and liberties. I \nfear that the most disadvantaged in our society be locked out of our \nsystem of justice, a system that is already becoming increasingly \nharder for them to access. I fear that the President's powers will grow \nbeyond what the Framers intended them to be, and I fear that Congress's \nhands will be tied even further and we will be unable to do the work of \nthe American people.\n  Therefore, I cannot and will not vote to confirm a nominee who will \nshift the Court in this ideological way. I believe that Judge Alito had \nthe burden of proving not just to me, but to the American people, that \nhe would not be a Justice who would move the Court far to the right, \nthat he would understand what was settled law and what was not. I \nbelieve he failed to carry that burden. I believe if he moves the Court \nin the direction that I think he will--I hope I am proven wrong, but if \nhe moves it far to the right, then I think that those rights and values \nwhich we cherish so deeply will be set back and the country will move \nbackwards with them.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters to Senator Leahy \nand Senator Specter in opposition to this nomination from the Women's \nCaucus, Black Caucus, and Hispanic Caucus all be printed in the Record \nat this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 9, 2006.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Specter and Ranking Member Leahy: As women \n     Members of Congress who work hard to enact legislation and \n     promote policies that protect women and ensure equality \n     within our society, we fear our work, and the contributions \n     of our colleagues who served before us, will be dismantled \n     with the confirmation of Judge Samuel Alito to the U.S. \n     Supreme Court.\n       We believe that Judge Alito poses a direct threat to the \n     rights of women in America. As the attached memorandum \n     details, Judge Alito has a long record of extreme views on \n     women's reproductive health, sexual and workplace \n     discrimination, the Family Medical Leave Act and civil \n     rights. He has worked to thwart established precedent and has \n     affiliated himself with radical organizations that have \n     actively sought to keep women and minorities from advancing \n     educationally and economically.\n       Under the scrutiny of the nomination process, it is not \n     surprising that Judge Alito now disavows his positions on \n     issues important to women and families in order to secure \n     confirmation votes. But his record speaks to his true views \n     and it speaks loudly. Rather than offering a balanced \n     successor to the moderate views of Justice Sandra Day \n     O'Connor and the majority of this nation, Judge Alito's \n     nomination radically tips the scales of justice against \n     women.\n       As guardians of the Constitution, Supreme Court Justices \n     play a key role in protecting and ensuring our liberties. \n     They are given life tenures and are expected to stay above \n     the political fray so their decisions will be fair and \n     unbiased. They must judge cases with impartiality and open \n     mindedness, and they must respect settled law.\n       You have a responsibility to ensure that the highest court \n     is not stacked against the hard fought rights that protect \n     women across the country. When you consider the nomination of \n     Judge Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court, we hope you will \n     reflect on the milestones in women's rights and determine \n     that America cannot afford to abandon these fundamental \n     protections. We encourage you to review the attached \n     memorandum which details many of the disturbing examples of \n     Judge Alito's extreme views of women's rights in law. We urge \n     you to consider that this lifetime appointment will have \n     detrimental consequences for American women, and oppose the \n     confirmation of Judge Alito as the next U.S. Supreme Court \n     Justice.\n           Sincerely,\n         Louise M. Slaughter, Tammy Baldwin, Lois Capps, Jane \n           Harman, Barbara Lee, Doris O. Matsui, Juanita \n           Millender-McDonald, Hilda L. Solis, Corrine Brown, Rosa \n           L.

Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Specter and Ranking Member Leahy: As you \n     examine the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to the United \n     States Supreme Court, we ask that you consider the particular \n     implications that Judge Alito's confirmation would have on \n     the Latino community.\n       We are deeply disappointed that President Bush did not take \n     this third opportunity to nominate a qualified Latino to the \n     Supreme Court. Given the size of the Hispanic community in \n     the United States, the under-representation of Hispanics in \n     the judiciary and the abundance of Hispanics qualified for \n     appointment, it is difficult to comprehend the President's \n     decision other than in the harsh light of political factors \n     trumping all other considerations.\n       We do not need to stress to you the importance of this \n     nomination and the impact that the Court has on the lives of \n     our citizens. We are equally confident that you understand \n     the critical role that the Supreme Court has played in \n     safeguarding the rights of minorities. Oftentimes it is the \n     Court to which minorities must turn for protection from \n     discriminatory laws and practices. It is therefore important \n     that nominees are sensitive to the experiences and struggles \n     that minorities have faced in securing their constitutional \n     rights.\n       While Judge Alito's background and record on the bench have \n     been largely discussed in the public forum his opportunity to \n     explain his opinions and philosophy will come during the \n     confirmation hearings. Like all Americans, we deserve and \n     expect clear answers on his record both on and off the bench, \n     as many of his opinions and writings give us reason to be \n     concerned. In order to better gauge his current attitudes, we \n     respectfully request that you consider asking Judge Alito the \n     attached questions or questions similar to these during the \n     confirmation hearings in the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n       While we should not expect any Supreme Court justice to \n     consistently rule in a manner that we agree with, we hope \n     that the successor to Justice Sandra Day O'Connor will share \n     her tradition of being fair, open-minded and unbiased towards \n     any specific group.\n       Thank you for taking these views into consideration as you \n     proceed with fulfilling your constitutional duty to provide \n     advice and consent on Judge Alito's nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n     Grace F. Napolitano,\n                             Chair, Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\n     Charles A.

Alito, Jr.\n\n\nA. Racial (Ethnic) Discrimination: Pemberthy v. Beyer, 19 F.3d 857 (3d \n                               Cir. 1994)\n\n       Facts: Alito wrote majority opinion allowing ``peremptory \n     challenges'' by the prosecution of bilingual prospective \n     jurors because of concerns that ability to understand Spanish \n     would jeopardize jurors' acceptance of official translations \n     of tape recorded conversations.\n       Question: This holding would provide a vehicle for striking \n     jurors based on ethnicity (i.e., Latinos more likely to speak \n     Spanish) under the guise of ``language concerns''. Why isn't \n     this unconstitutional as it relates to the prospective juror \n     being struck (deprivation of right to serve on jury, \n     participate in government)? Why isn't this unconstitutional \n     as to the defendant per Batson precedent?\n\n\n B. Voting Rights Act: Jenkins v. Manning, 116 F.3D 685 (3d Cir. 1997)\n\n       Facts: The issue was the ``at-large'' election of school \n     board members. After reversing and remanding the District \n     Court's ruling that no violation of the VRA took place, the \n     District Court considered additional evidence and again found \n     no violation. Judge Alito appears to have joined the majority \n     in affirming the District Court's ruling. Judge Rosen's \n     dissent is insightful and a good example of a judge's \n     exercise of discretion in viewing the same evidence and \n     reaching a decision that gives meaning to the VRA.\n       Question: The ``Senate Factors'' (after finding Gingles \n     factors present) were additional and necessary considerations \n     and consisted of (1) the extent to which minority group \n     members had been elected to public office in the jurisdiction \n     and (2) the extent to which voting in the elections of the \n     political subdivision is racially polarized. Judge Alito \n     found that the Senate Factors were met when historically only \n     3 of 10 black candidates over a 10 year period were \n     successful (one in a never-repeated plurality win and one by \n     a black candidate defeating another black candidate). Would \n     Judge Alito please elaborate on his ``judicial philosophy'' \n     when it comes to VRA and ``at-large'' voting districts?\n\n\n  C. Immigrant Rights: 1986 Deputy Attorney General Alito Memo to FBI \n                        Director William Webster\n\n       Facts: The memo reflects Judge Alito's legal analysis that \n     ``. . . illegal aliens have no claim to nondiscrimination \n     with respect to non-fundamental rights.''\n       Question: In light of Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 67 (1982), \n     how does he reconcile his conclusions that appear to be based \n     on the 1976 case of Matthews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67 (1976), \n     obviously a case decided PRIOR to Plyler? Does he follow \n     precedent only when convenient? If he is not willing to \n     follow existing precedent (is there any other kind?), then it \n     would appear that if he is able to establish ``precedent'' \n     (that's what the Supreme Court does), he will do it readily \n     and easily.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Congressional Black Caucus,\n\n\n                                              Rayburn Building\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 17, 2006.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: On December 8, 2005, the Congressional \n     Black Caucus (CBC) announced its opposition to the \n     confirmation of Judge Samuel Alito to the United States \n     Supreme Court. We announced this decision prior to the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee's confirmation hearings after making an \n     extensive review of his record as a judge and as a high-level \n     government official and after Judge Alito and the \n     Administration failed to respond to our request for a meeting \n     with the nominee. Unfortunately, nothing transpired at the \n     hearings before the Judiciary Committee to change our view \n     that Judge Alito should not be confirmed.\n       If the Senate values its own work on federal statutes in \n     many areas of American life, it will find unacceptable Judge \n     Alito's record as a frequent dissenter in commerce clause and \n     other cases involving of long established congressional \n     authority to enact laws benefiting Americans of every \n     background. For example, his dissent in United States v. \n     Rybar, in which he unsuccessfully sought to restrict \n     congressional authority to regulate machine guns, is an \n     example of a dangerous retrenchment that could have far-\n     reaching consequences for many kinds of federal legislation \n     that have long been considered well within congressional \n     power.\n       However, the CBC is most especially concerned that Judge \n     Alito's record on matters of race reflects a consistent \n     pattern of hostility to race discrimination cases and \n     remedies. This pattern places at extreme risk important work \n     of the Supreme Court and the Congress to eliminate \n     discrimination in voting, employment and other critical areas \n     in which Judge Alito's dissents have left little doubt about \n     his views. If he is promoted to the Supreme Court, where \n     stare decisis is less constraining and where his views are no \n     longer subject to reversal, his dissents can be expected to \n     become the law of the land. In that case, we have no doubt \n     that racial progress would be reversed, especially in light \n     of the delicate 5-4 balance that has existed on the Court. \n     We, therefore, believe that a vote for Judge Alito would \n     radically change the Court and lead to an erosion of 50 \n     years of jurisprudence on matters of race and equality. \n     Our country moves in that direction at its peril.\n       We find extremely troubling the consistency and \n     predictability of Judge Alito's hard-right views in an area \n     that has been so critical to African Americans and where his \n     views could become the decisive vote. The best evidence that \n     Judge Alito is a judge of extreme views is the often strongly \n     critical written opinions of his judicial colleagues. Faced \n     with Supreme Court precedents upholding remedies for \n     discrimination, Judge Alito has sought instead to close the \n     Federal courts to job discrimination claims by using \n     unprecedented technical evidentiary standards long rejected \n     by the Supreme Court. For 40 years in an unbroken record of \n     thousands of job discrimination cases, the Supreme Court and \n     every federal circuit have left no doubt that discrimination \n     claims must not be prematurely destroyed by requiring \n     significant upfront evidence before trial. Consequently, all \n     the Third Circuit judges in an en banc review in Sheridan v. \n     E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Company criticized Judge Alito, \n     the only dissenter, for seeking to elevate the standard \n     necessary for a woman, who alleged her employer failed to \n     promote her, to even get access to the Federal courts to \n     attempt to prove discrimination. Undeterred, the next year in \n     Bray v. Marriott Hotels, Judge Alito was similarly admonished \n     by the Circuit's majority in a racial discrimination case in \n     which a hotel employee was denied a promotion. In sharply \n     criticizing Judge Alito, the majority said that if they \n     followed his lead, ``Title VII [the basic job discrimination \n     statute] would be eviscerated.''\n       Habitually attempting to use procedural technicalities to \n     get around precedents, Judge Alito has been a virtually \n     automatic vote to deny discrimination claims in 14 of the 18 \n     job discrimination cases he has considered. In one of the \n     cases, he favored white civil rights complainants, Pittsburgh \n     police officers who sued alleging reverse discrimination, and \n     in another he ruled in favor of a mentally disabled employee. \n     Alito's hostility to discrimination cases could not be more \n     systematic, carrying over to claims against the disabled as \n     well, where the Third Circuit criticized his dissent that \n     would allow ``few if any'' Rehabilitation Act plaintiffs \n     access to the courts (Nathanson v. Medical College of \n     Pennsylvania).\n       Considering the distance the Nation has come on race and \n     the distance still to go, in our view the confirmation of \n     Judge Alito would mark a dangerous step backwards. In our \n     view, no one who reads his opinions can believe that he has \n     the open mind required of a Supreme Court justice. Judge \n     Alito moved from his days in the Reagan Justice Department, \n     where he sought unsuccessfully to get the Supreme Court to \n     restrict discrimination remedies, to the Third Circuit, where \n     he has compiled a striking record as a dissenter, rather than \n     follow employment discrimination precedents.\n       The evidence is too clear to leave any doubt about where \n     Judge Alito would stand, for example, on fragile 5-4 rulings \n     in which Justice O'Connor has been the deciding vote. Among \n     these cases are the University of Michigan case upholding \n     affirmative action in law school admissions (Grutter v. \n     Bollinger) and other cases where the Court has allowed race \n     to be considered as a factor to rectify discrimination. As we \n     approach reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act in 2007, \n     the Congressional Black Caucus cannot afford to forget that \n     the 5-4 cases also include redistricting cases such as Hunt \n     v. Cromartie.\n       A critical election year of accountability for the Congress \n     must begin with how members of the Senate vote on this \n     nominee. All that we have fought for in order to secure \n     rights long denied African Americans is put at risk by this \n     nomination. For African Americans, the stakes don't get any \n     higher. Therefore, the members of the CBC are asking you and \n     all of your colleagues to vote against the confirmation of \n     Judge Alito.\n           Sincerely,\n     Melvin L. Watt,\n                                                       Chair, CBC.\n     Eleanor Holmes Norton,\n                                   CBC Judicial Nominations Chair.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to give my full support to \nJudge Alito to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. I am sure \nthat will be no great surprise to those who have followed my career.\n  I want to lay out in brief why I believe Judge Alito is exactly the \nkind of Justice this country needs at this time and, candidly, is \nexactly the kind of Justice this country, for the most part, has had, \nin keeping with its constitutional traditions over the last 200-plus \nyears.\n  Judge Alito is not from Pennsylvania, although he claims to be a \nPhillie fan, which is fine by me. I somewhat prefer the Pirates, being \nfrom\n\n[[Page S77]]\n\nPittsburgh. I certainly respect him. He comes from the Third Circuit, \nwhich includes the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. I have had an \nopportunity to talk to many of his colleagues on the court, Republicans \nand Democrats. Both Republicans and Democrats--everyone I have spoken \nto, and I have spoken to several--have praised him in the highest terms \npossible. Colleagues of his have stepped forward and have used terms of \nrespect you don't often hear. Unfortunately, you don't often hear it \naround this body--certainly not lately--but you certainly heard it from \nthem both privately and publicly, saying how much integrity the man \nhas, how much his legal acumen is right on, as are his demeanor, \njurisprudence, and humility--all of the things one would want to see \nout of a judge, and they speak in glowing terms about him. So that was \nmy introduction to him.\n  I had never met Judge Alito prior to his nomination. When he was \nnominated, one of the first things I did was call some of his \ncolleagues. I did it to get a sense of the kind of man he was. The \nresponse I received was overwhelming.\n  One of the things I want to cover is how I believe that his view of \nthe role of a judge is very similar to John Roberts' view of the role \nof a judge. In fact, his record, in my opinion, and the way he \napproaches the law is remarkably similar to the judge who is now a \nJustice confirmed here in the Senate by 70-plus votes. I am somewhat at \na loss to see why Judge Alito is not receiving similar support, because \ntheir records and their approach to the law are remarkably similar, in \nmy mind. He is a judge who, when I met him, used very much the same \nterms as Justice Roberts--terms such as humility and modesty in dealing \nwith the matters before them; that he was not to be a judge who was to \nimpose his views on the case before him.\n  Many have tried to claim that somehow or another he is ideological. I \ndon't think there is anything in the Record that would indicate Judge \nAlito applies his own personal viewpoints to the case at hand. He looks \nat the law, looks at the facts of the case and does his best on the \nnarrowest grounds possible to decide the cases before him. That is what \na judge is supposed to do--not say, gee, here is my opportunity to \nchange the law, my opportunity to right a wrong that I think Americans \nor a particular State or the Government has done that I disagree with; \nhere is my opportunity to change the law by using the force of the \nConstitution to impose my values. That is not what he does. Again, what \nhe also doesn't do--and it strikes me as a very odd discussion when it \ncomes to analyzing a judge's rulings on who he rules for, does he rule \nfor the little guy or the big guy, as if little guys are always right \nand big guys are always wrong, or vice versa, for that matter. It is \nthe idea that you don't decide the case before you based on the law and \nthe facts but based on whether you like the plaintiff, or you like the \ndefendant, or what is a sympathetic figure on one side or the other--\nthat is about the worst kind of justice you can possibly acknowledge.\n  My colleagues who say he rules for the big guys or the big \ncorporations, or whoever it is, are you saying every action that comes \nbefore the Court where a little guy is in a case, he automatically \nshould win? Is that what it is? If you are not a judge who rules for \nthe little guy all the time, is it true that somehow you don't have a \nproper view of the law? This is a remarkable discussion I keep hearing. \nI heard over and over again in the Judiciary Committee about the result \nof these cases and who he sides with. Is that somehow a point which is \nlegitimate when it comes to a judge? The question is, is he an \nappellate jurist who was following the law? Was he properly applying \nthe law to the case? It is not who won or lost the case. I find it very \ndisturbing that we are reducing this confirmation process to whose side \nhe ruled on and whether ideologically he fits a particular Senator's \nview of a particular issue or particular issues. That is not how we \nhave ever viewed Justices in the Senate. We do not keep scorecards of \nwhether you side with the little guy or big guy or how you came down on \ncases. We certainly have not had ideological litmus tests in the past \non judicial nominations.\n  Those two things, I have to tell you, that have been some of the more \nfrequent criticisms of Judge Alito trouble me as to how we are morphing \nthe judicial process or the selection, approval, and confirmation \nprocess into sort of a campaign process, into a process of how we elect \nlegislators and Presidents. We are not electing a legislator or a \nPresident, someone who we have a right to know their ideology or what \nside they are going to come down on.\n  We are electing someone whose job it is to play it right down the \nmiddle, whose job it is to be blind justice, who is going to weigh the \nfacts in the law and do what it dictates, not do what they believe, in \ntheir ideological viewpoint, is right.\n  I am disturbed by the criticism, but I am very encouraged by Judge \nAlito and the way he has conducted himself and the way he answered the \nquestions and how he has, in fact, laid out a very concise and well-\nreasoned approach to his making decisions on the Court in the past.\n  He obviously has impeccable credentials. The Senator from Utah is in \nthe Chamber right now, and I heard him say over and over that no one \nhas the credentials this man has and the experience he brings to the \nSupreme Court. No one, in my view, has been more personally decent, \nhumble, and modest dealing with a rather rancorous hearing process. He \ncame off, at least from my view, as exactly the kind of temperament we \nwould want of a Supreme Court Justice--of any judge. He is obviously \nhighly intelligent, battling wits with some of the best minds in the \nSenate. During this process, both privately and publicly, he has been \ngracious. He is, again, someone I am very proud to support.\n  If I can, for a moment, talk again about where we are in the context \nof the role of the judiciary in our democratic process. We often talk \nabout the tyranny of the judiciary--many on our side of the aisle do--\nhow the judiciary has run amok in its ever-unceasing quest to take \nresponsibilities and decisions away from the elected democratic bodies \nof our country and hoist it onto the backs of the Supreme Court or the \ncourts in our country. That is a very dangerous precedent we have seen \nover the last 30 and 40 years in our courts, that increasingly \ndecisions are being made by the judicial system and, in so doing, \nbarring the House, the Senate, and the President from regulating or \nlegislating in that area in the future, in a sense making these \nsubstantive decisions as to how we should live our lives, how our \neconomy will function, how our laws will be written across the street \nin an unelected body as opposed to how the democratic process works--to \nhave the people's collective will reflected in their laws.\n  One of the reasons I think these nominations are so important and \nmaybe so contentious is because we are at a point right now where there \nhas been a movement for many years to bypass the democratic process, \nbypass the people's Houses and go to the courts to get an extreme \nagenda passed and into law in this country.\n  The voices we have heard over the past couple of months during this \nnomination and which we heard somewhat more muted during the Roberts \nnomination were of those trying to hold onto power by holding onto a \nmajority on the Supreme Court of the United States to continue to \npromulgate a far-left-of-center agenda on a variety of issues, using \nthe Court as the place to silence the people in their collective \njudgments.\n  One of the reasons that I think is vitally important for putting a \nJudge Alito on this Court, and hopefully future Judge Alitos as other \nvacancies occur, is that we will have an opportunity to return a \nbalance of power in this country away from nine unelected people across \nthe street from the Senate to the halls of the people's bodies, to the \nliving rooms of America, for them to be able to make these decisions \nthat are important to the future of our country and not have those \ndecisions taken from them by radical judges on our courts.\n  So this is an important step. Do I believe that we are going to see, \nas a result of Judge Alito's confirmation, which appears to be all but \ncertain, a dramatic change in the precedents of the U.S. Supreme Court? \nI sort of doubt that we will see dramatic change, certainly not any \ntime soon. But I think what we will see is a more\n\n[[Page S78]]\n\nmodest approach to dealing with the problems with which the Supreme \nCourt is confronted. We will not see cases where the Court could decide \na case on a narrow issue and settle the dispute at hand and instead of \ndoing so take the opportunity, ``while we are at it,'' to overturn a \nvariety of precedents they don't need to overturn and create new \nlegislation, if you will, through their judicial opinions. We see that \nhappen time and again. It threatens the very foundation of our country.\n  Thomas Jefferson understood that. Jefferson in 1821--this was after \nhe was President, 5 years before he died, obviously a great student of \nour Constitution, obviously a great student of the powers of the \nCongress and the judiciary and obviously of the Presidency--he said, in \nreflecting on this very delicate system and the balance of power among \nthe executive, the judicial, and the legislative branch:\n\n       The germ of destruction of our Nation is in the power of \n     the judiciary, an irresponsible body working like gravity by \n     night and by day, gaining a little today and a little \n     tomorrow and advancing its noiseless step like a thief over \n     the field of jurisdiction until all shall render powerless \n     the checks of one branch over the other and will become as \n     venal and oppressive as the government from which we \n     separated.\n\n  He saw the power of an immodest, a brash, a bold judiciary in its \nability by using the ultimate law of the land, the Constitution, in \ngrabbing power by day and by night quietly--drip, drip, drip--taking \nthe power away from the people and ceding it to itself so that, to \nparaphrase Jefferson, they would be like the monarchs we left, ruling \nfrom their kings' benches.\n  This is a true threat, in my opinion, to the democracy in America \ntoday. Jefferson, as he did with many issues, had it right here too. \nThere have been times in American history where the pendulum has swung \nin favor of one branch of Government to the other. I think this is such \na time when we have seen that pendulum swing to the Supreme Court, and \nit is incumbent upon all of us to make sure that equilibrium is \nrestored.\n  I know there are a lot of folks who are listening who say: I like the \ndecisions the Supreme Court has made; that is why I am out here \narguing, to make sure we can preserve that. I can say what is good for \nthe goose is good for the gander. There may, indeed, come a day--\nalthough I hope it will not come--there may, indeed, come a day when \nthis Court decides, since we have power to make laws in favor of those \nwho like the recent decisions of the courts or decisions over the last \n30, 40 years, there may come a time when they take that same authority \nand make a whole host of decisions that you don't like.\n  Whether I am in the Senate or somewhere else at that point in time, I \nhope I will have the integrity and the ability to stand up and \ncriticize that Court such as I am criticizing the courts over the last \n30 years for their activities. There is no place for the Court imposing \nits will and making laws. There is no place for that in our \nConstitution. That is not their role.\n  I am very pleased the President understands that and that he has put \nforth judges who I believe understand that point of view as a member of \nthe judiciary. I am hopeful that we will confirm Judge Alito and that \nwe will continue this process of creating a better balance of powers \namong the Congress, the executive branch, and the judiciary. This is a \nvery important, in my opinion, second step in that process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I enjoyed my colleague's remarks. We are in \nthe final stretch of considering the nomination of Samuel Alito to the \nSupreme Court of the United States, and by any reasonable objective or \ntraditional standard, Judge Alito deserves overwhelming confirmation, \nwithout question.\n  The first reason Judge Alito should be confirmed is that he is highly \nqualified to serve on the Supreme Court. It amazes me that some parties \nto this debate practically ignore his qualifications altogether. They \nare so intent on manufacturing a case against this nominee that they \nbrush aside this seemingly minor detail of his qualifications as if it \nwere just an annoyance.\n  After serving in the Department of Justice and as a highly regarded \nFederal prosecutor, Judge Alito has served on the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Third Circuit since 1990, has participated in nearly 5,000 \ncases, and has written more than 360 opinions. He has more judicial \nexperience than any Supreme Court nominee in the last three-quarters of \na century.\n  The American Bar Association, which conducts perhaps the most \ncomprehensive and exhaustive evaluation of Supreme Court nominees, \ninterviewed more than 300 people who know and have worked with Judge \nAlito. The American Bar Association, after all those interviews, \nunanimously gave Judge Alito its highest well-qualified rating. Here, \ntoo, it is amazing how some Senators and leftwing interest groups brush \naside this ABA rating as if they were dusting the mantel.\n  While the ABA's role in the judicial appointment process has been \ncontroversial at times, certainly no one has ever charged it with a \nconservative bias--no one. It was my Democratic colleagues and their \nleftwing interest groups that once lauded the ABA rating as the \nveritable gold standard for evaluating judicial nominees.\n  The criteria for the ABA's highest well-qualified rating includes \nJudge Alito's compassion, openmindedness, freedom from bias and \ncommitment to equal justice under the law. Judge Samuel Alito is \neminently qualified to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  The second reason Judge Alito should be confirmed is that he is a man \nof character and integrity. Anybody watching those proceedings would \nhave to conclude that. I have been struck, throughout this process, at \nthe level of respect and praise for Judge Alito's character and \nintegrity, how it is directly related to how well people know him, how \nclosely they have worked with him. Without exception, those sounding \nthe most dire warnings, creating the most negative caricatures, and \npainting the scariest picture of Judge Alito are those who know him the \nleast or who do not know him at all.\n  We have heard from those who worked with him at the Department of \nJustice and in the U.S. Attorney's Office in New Jersey. We have heard \nfrom Judge Alito's law clerks and fellow judges, and there were dozens \nof those law clerks from all across the ideological spectrum who were \nsupportive of Judge Alito.\n  Make no mistake, this is not a bunch of rightwing clones but a \ndiverse group of men and women, liberals and conservatives of different \nreligions and backgrounds. They do not agree with him on every issue \nor, in some cases, they don't agree with him on virtually any issue at \nall, but they all praise Judge Alito as a man of character and \nintegrity. Judge Samuel Alito possesses the character and integrity \nnecessary to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  The third reason Judge Alito should be confirmed is that he \nunderstands and is committed to the appropriately limited role of the \njudiciary. America's Founders established a system of limited \nGovernment containing three branches, each with its category of power \nand ability to check the others. The judicial branch is as much a part \nof this system of Government and must remain as limited as the \nlegislative and executive branches.\n  The fight over judicial appointments is a fight over whether we \nshould stick with the system America's Founders established.\n  Some want to change that system because, frankly, it does not give \nthem everything they want.\n  Self-government, after all, can be a little messy and sometimes very \nfrustrating.\n  Letting the people and their elected representatives make the law and \ndefine the culture means that, on any given day, certain political \ninterests win and others lose.\n  Some who lose in the political process pick themselves up and try \nagain another day.\n  Others leave the political process behind and go to the courts, \ntrying to persuade judges to impose upon the American people policies \nand priorities the people would not choose for themselves, or they \ncould never get through the elected representatives of the people.\n\n[[Page S79]]\n\n  The fight over judicial appointments is whether we should have judges \nwilling to take such political bait.\n  It is fashionable in some circles to put the Supreme Court on a \npedestal, pretending that a few unelected judges are supposed to lead \nus to some kind of promised land.\n  During the debates about Chief Justice John Roberts' nomination last \nfall and Judge Alito's nomination now, we have heard all sorts of grand \ndescriptions of the judiciary's role and purpose.\n  The judiciary, we are told, is the engine of social progress, the \nprotector of all our rights and liberties, even the savior of the \nenvironment.\n  Yesterday, in the Judiciary Committee's businss meeting, the ranking \nDemocratic member said that the very reason the Supreme Court exists is \nto be ``a constitutional check on the expansion of presidential \npower.''\n  The Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, said the very same \nthing yesterday, that the Supreme Court's historic role is ``enforcing \nconstitutional limits on presidential power.''\n  These grand descriptions give the impression that the Supreme Court \nalone polices our system of separated power, hands down decrees about \nissues, opines on abstract theories, and decides how best to order the \nuniverse.\n  It does no such thing. The last time I checked, most of the Supreme \nCourt's cases have nothing whatsoever to do with issues such as \npresidential power, abortion, religion, or the environment.\n  The Supreme Court does not exist to run the country, right all \nwrongs, and usher in peace and domestic tranquility.\n  The judiciary is part of our system of limited government; it is not \na system unto itself. It is that whole system of government, not anyone \npart of it, that protects our rights and liberties, checks excessive \ngovernment power, provides for social progress, and all the rest.\n  As a part of that system, judges who exceed their proper role and \npower are no less a threat to liberty than legislators or the president \nwho do so.\n  In the famous case of Marbury v. Madison, Chief Justice John Marshall \nwrote that the Constitution was designed for the government of courts \nas much as of legislatures.\n  As Chief Justice Roberts put it last fall, judges are not \npoliticians.\n  The tendency of some in this debate simply to look at the results \njudges deliver is, therefore, misguided because it suggests that \njudges, as politicians, are free to take whatever side they choose and \nthe only thing that matters is whose side judges are on.\n  This politicized approach misleads our fellow citizens about the \njudiciary and its proper place in our system of government.\n  America's founders had a very different view and, I am glad to say, \nJudge Alito sides with them.\n  As the Constitution puts it, judges exercise judicial power in the \ncontext of cases and controversies. Judges do not make the law they \napply. Judges are neither school boards nor inspectors general. Judges \nare neither legislative oversight commissions nor political \nprovocateurs. Instead, judges settle legal disputes by applying already \nestablished law to cases that come before them.\n  Because that is what they do, it is impossible to properly evaluate \njudges or judicial nominees the way we evaluate politicians, by the \nresults they can be expected to deliver.\n  Yet that is exactly what we see in this judicial confirmation \nprocess.\n  To hear some of my Democratic colleagues and their left-wing interest \ngroup friends talk, there is absolutely nothing that is not the \njudiciary's job. That is ridiculous.\n  To hear some of them talk, everything is fair game for judges and the \nonly thing that matters is who wins that game.\n  America's founders rejected that view, and Judge Alito should be \nconfirmed because he rejects that view.\n  I hope we find more qualified men and women who believe there is \nsomething, anything, that is not a judge's job and appoint them to the \njudiciary right away.\n  While scorecards are familiar in the political process, they have no \nplace in the judicial process.\n  Again, I quote Judge Alito: ``I don't think a judge should be keeping \na scorecard about how many times the judge votes for one category of \nlitigant versus another in particular types of cases. That would be \nwrong. We are supposed to do justice on an individual basis in the \ncases that come before us.''\n  Who can disagree with that? Yet, they seem to on the other side.\n  I hope that my fellow citizens are watching this debate, either live \nright now or when it is replayed later.\n  I ask my fellow citizens, do you agree with Judge Alito? Do your \nexpect judges to do justice on an individual basis, to take each case \non its own facts and its own merits, and to decide it solely according \nto the law? Or do you expect a judge to look at a case not as a legal \ndispute between real parties, but as a political issue, deciding it \nbased on his opinion of the issue, practically before the case even \ncomes before him?\n  Judge Alito rejects scorecards and tallies, he rejects percentages \nand patterns, and looks at each case based on its own facts and the law \nthat applies.\n  I might add that at one time in the proceedings one of the Democratic \nSenators said he never ruled in favor of labor. We immediately showed a \nnumber of cases where he did. You can find rulings by Judge Alito \nacross the spectrum with respect to people who should have won those \ncases.\n  Let me describe another revolutionary idea. Let me read it.\n  At his hearing, Judge Alito said that ``although the judiciary has a \nvery important role to play, it's a limited role. . . . Judges don't \nhave the authority to change the Constitution. . . . The Constitution \nis an enduring document and the Constitution doesn't change.''\n  Let me speak again to my fellow citizens out there who may be \nwatching.\n  The first three words of the Constitution are ``we the people.''\n  The Constitution belongs to the people.\n  It does not belong to judges.\n  The Constitution, your Constitution--I am speaking to the people out \nthere--already has a specific process for changing it, and the only \nbranch of government involved in that process is this one, the \nlegislative branch, the one you directly elect.\n  If America's founders explicitly excluded the judiciary from the \nprocess of changing the Constitution, do you think instead that judges \nshould now be able to change the Constitution?\n  Do you believe that the Constitution, your Constitution, is whatever \njudges say it is?\n  It is the Constitution that ultimately protects our rights and \nliberties.\n  If the Constitution means whatever judges say it means, then our \nrights and liberties are whatever judges say they are. They are not \nelected. They are nominated, appointed and confirmed for life.\n  If that is what my Democratic colleagues and their left-wing interest \ngroup allies mean when they say the judiciary protects us, then do not \nsign me up for that protection package.\n  Our rights and liberties, and particularly the rights and liberties \nof the minority, are secure only when the constitution is solid.\n  Judge Alito is precisely the kind of judge who will protect our \nrights and liberties because he does not believe that he defines them.\n  So the case for Judge Alito's confirmation is overwhelming. He is \nhighly qualified, he is a man of character and integrity, and he \nunderstands and is committed to the properly limited role of judges in \nour system of government.\n  In the past, this would have been enough for confirmation by a wide \nbipartisan margin.\n  Perhaps because this case for confirmation is so strong, Judge \nAlito's opponents have tried a host of attacks that not only have \nfailed but have degraded this process along the way.\n  One is the familiar guilt-by-association tactic, trying to smear \nJudge Alito by attacking a group of conservative Princeton alumni to \nwhich he once belonged. Membership in this group, mind you, was nothing \nmore than a magazine subscription. Imagine if someone tried to \nattribute to each of you everything published in every magazine or \nnewsletter you receive.\n  Some Democratic Senators used this very illegitimate tactic on Judge \nAlito, selecting the most salacious or controversial articles which \nJudge Alito never read. One Senator even tried to\n\n[[Page S80]]\n\npass a parody of such outrageous views off as the real thing. That is \nhow denigrating this process became.\n  Our staff spent hours pouring through boxes of documents related to \nthis group and the name Samuel Alito never appeared on a single scrap \nof paper--not one.\n  The disinformation was even worse in the media.\n  The group in question, or at least some of its members, wanted to \npreserve Princeton's all-male tradition and opposed affirmative \naction--in other words, affirmative action.\n  On January 6, a well-known pundit claimed on the FOX News Channel \nthat Judge Alito himself was personally ``trying to keep women and \nminorities out of Princeton.''\n  I have been around for a long time, and I have seen a lot of bad \njournalism, but this goes beyond the pale. This goes beyond spin, \nbeyond any reasonable characterization of the facts. In fact, it is \nridiculous.\n  When I asked what the media characterizes as a softball question, \nsarcastically asking it, are you really against having women or \nminorities in colleges, anybody listening to that had to conclude I was \nbeing sarcastic. He said, Of course not.\n  When I said I thought that is what he thinks, I couldn't have been \nmore sarcastic. But apparently I am so serious on most matters that \npeople thought I was serious on that. But it is ridiculous, this guilt \nby association that went on, even in the committee, in something as \nimportant as the Judiciary Committee of the Senate.\n  Let me address a few of the other arguments by Judge Alito's \nopponents. Yesterday, at the Judiciary Committee markup, the Senator \nfrom New York, Mr. Schumer, tried once again to paint Judge Alito as an \nout-of-control judge, wantonly disregarding and seeking to disrupt his \nown court's past decisions. The political rhetorical value of the \ntactic is obvious. If Judge Alito played fast and loose with his \npresent court's precedence, the story goes he would certainly do so on \nthe Supreme Court.\n  The problem is that this claim, this picture of Judge Alito as an \nactivist judge out to remake precedent in his own image is patently \nwrong. It bears no relationship to reality.\n  At Judge Alito's hearing, the Senator from New York cited a few cases \nin which colleagues disagreed with how Judge Alito treated the court's \nprior decisions. The Senator from New York made no attempt whatever to \ndetermine whether Judge Alito's position in those cases was right or \nwrong. He simply grabbed quotes supporting his preconceived point of \nview.\n  With all due respect to the judges who disagreed with Judge Alito in \nthose cases, they could very well be the ones who misread or misapplied \nthe Third Circuit's prior decisions.\n  What the Senator from New York never said was that Judge Alito has \ndissented in just 79 of the more than 5,000 cases in which he \nparticipated. That is a rate below the average for appeal court judges \naround the country.\n  Something else the Senator from New York has not revealed is Judge \nAlito has voted to overturn his own court's precedence just four times \nin his whole 15 years on the bench. In each of those cases in which all \nthe judges of the circuit participated, Judge Alito was in the \nmajority, and two of them were unanimous in each of those cases. He was \nin the majority, and two of them had a unanimous majority.\n  My colleagues will remember that seven of Judge Alito's current and \nformer judicial colleagues appeared before the Judiciary Committee. Who \nbetter to give the Senate real insight of Judge Alito's approach to \ncases, his attitude toward litigants, and his perspective on the law? \nBetter yet, what a unique opportunity to hear from those fellow judges \nabout how Judge Alito handled precedent.\n  I might add that earlier in the hearing, for example, the Senator \nfrom New York quoted a passage critical of Judge Alito from the \nmajority opinion in Dia v. Ashcroft. Chief Judge Anthony Scirica joined \nthat opinion. Chief Judge Scirica was sitting right there in front of \nthe committee.\n  The Senator from New York also quoted a passage critical of Judge \nAlito from Judge Leonard Garth's dissent in Bray v. Marriott Hotels. \nJudge Garth visited with us via teleconference from Arizona. That would \nhave been a great opportunity to question the very judges on the side \nof the Senator from New York of evidence of Judge Alito's activism and \ndisregard for precedent. Hearing it from them could be more meaningful \nthan cutting and pasting a few selected quotes from poster board. Yet \nthe Senator from New York did not ask those judges questions about this \nissue. In fact, he did not ask any questions at all because he did not \nattend that portion of the hearing. That was his right.\n  I asked him about it. I referred to the claims by the Senator from \nNew York and asked the judges whether Judge Alito disregards precedent, \nwhether he has an agenda to disrupt the court's prior decisions. Judge \nEdward Becker, former Chief Judge of the Third Circuit Court of \nAppeals, participated with Judge Alito in more than 1,000 cases. Judge \nBecker said he never saw Judge Alito disregard or ignore precedent. \nJudge Alito followed precedent unless he believed the precedent was \ndistinguishable or was what judges called dicta--in other words, not \nbinding language in a particular case.\n  Another judge on that distinguished panel was Judge Ruggero Aldisert, \nappointed nearly 40 years ago by President Lyndon Johnson, and still \nserving on the court. In addition to his many years of service in both \nthe State and Federal courts, Judge Aldisert has written a well-known \ntextbook on the judicial process. Judge Aldisert was a Democrat. I know \nhim very well. I tried one of my first jury trials in front of Judge \nAldisert in the common pleas court in the highest trial court in \nPennsylvania. I got tears in my eyes when he appeared. But he, too, a \nDemocrat, defended as sound Judge Alito's treatment of precedent.\n  I might add, chatting with Judge Aldisert afterwards, he had had a \nnumber of health problems. He risked his life to come back to right \nthis wrong that had been done to one of his colleagues on the Third \nCircuit Court of Appeals. Judge Aldisert, when I knew him, and I have \nknown him all these years, but when I knew him as a young trial lawyer \nin Pittsburgh, Judge Aldisert was the national president of the Italian \nSons and Daughters of America. And proudly so. I was very proud of him \nwhen he went to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals and have been very \nproud of him since and proud of the scholarship he has written. He \nknows the difference between a good judge and a bad judge, and he has \nhad a world of experience. I got very emotional when I saw him once \nagain.\n\n  As I mentioned earlier, some of my Democrat colleagues are \nparticularly fond of scorecards and tallies, thinking that tells \nanything useful about a judge's approach to the law. Perhaps they can \ncreate something like a confirmation rate card listing the percentage \nof cases in different categories that one side or the other is supposed \nto win. Plaintiffs should win this percentage of employment \ndiscrimination, the prosecution is allowed to win this percentage of \ncriminal cases, and so on. Perhaps it can be a list titled ``Whose Side \nAre You Supposed To Be On'' as a judge. That is about the way it comes \noff. Before anyone dismisses this as ridiculous or farfetched, this is \nexactly what some of my Democrat colleagues and many of their leftwing \ninterest group friends have done to Judge Alito.\n  In his opening statement on January 9, the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, cited a so-called study by University of \nChicago law professor Cass Sunstein claiming that Judge Alito voted \nagainst the individual in 84 percent of his dissents. The Senator from \nMassachusetts did not quote from Professor Sunstein's letter that such \nstatistics must be taken with ``many grains of salt and with \nappropriate qualifications,'' or Professor Sunstein's own admission \nthat his analysis was done under what he called considerable time \npressure, rendering his conclusions only tentative and preliminary. \nAnd, of course, the Senator from Massachusetts did not examine any of \nthe dissents on the merits. He let the calculator do the talking. \nRemember, these are appeals. Most of the appeals are upheld on appeal.\n  Actually, the Senator from Massachusetts went much further than that. \nOn the basis of this one tentative and preliminary statistic from this \none study, he claimed that ``average Americans have had a hard time \ngetting a\n\n[[Page S81]]\n\nfair shake in [Judge Alito's] courtroom.'' That is an outrageous claim, \none that would not be at all justified even if the supposed evidence \nbehind it were more legitimate.\n  Let us be honest about this. Saying a pattern of past decisions shows \nan entire group of litigants will have a hard time getting a fair shake \nin the future is to accuse Judge Alito of bias.\n  Before the Senator from Massachusetts or anyone else using this \ntactic gets indignant, throws up his hand and claims he never accused \nJudge Alito of bias, there is simply no other meaning to what was said.\n  I again call into contention the testimony of those seven judges, all \ncircuit court of appeals Federal judges from all across the spectrum, \nwho said Judge Alito has never demonstrated any bias toward anybody. I \nwould much rather have their confirmation than any law professors in \nthis country, especially any liberal law professor in this country, or \nconservative law professor. What else could the words ``average \nAmericans have a hard time getting a fair shake'' actually mean?\n  Another example last week, Thursday, the Senator from Massachusetts \nclaimed that while on the appeals court Judge Alito literally bent over \nbackwards to ``help the powerful.''\n  He said:\n\n       The record is clear that the average person has a hard time \n     getting a fair shake in Judge Alito's courtroom.\n\n  These are his words, not mine. Saying that Judge Alito bends over \nbackwards to help the powerful means only one thing. Saying that a \ncategory of litigants will have a hard time getting a fair shake before \nJudge Alito means only one thing. If Senators wish to accuse Judge \nAlito of bias, they should do so up front, not through innuendo or \nhiding behind statistics.\n  Evaluating judges with a calculator is wrong, misguided, and misleads \nour fellow citizens about what judges do and the role they play in our \nsystem of government. Again, I call attention to the judges who \nappeared, all of whom spoke in favor of Judge Alito. In all honesty, \nlet me choose the most liberal of those judges. He has some very \ninteresting things to say. That was Judge Lewis who is retired now. He \nsaid:\n\n       I am openly and unapologetically pro-choice and always have \n     been. I am openly--and it's very well known--a committed \n     human rights and civil rights activist and actively engaged \n     in that process as my time permits. . . .\n       I am very, very much involved in a number of endeavors that \n     one who is familiar with Judge Alito's background and \n     experience may wonder--``Well, why are you here today saying \n     positive things about his prospects as a justice on the \n     Supreme Court?''\n       And the reason is that having worked with him, I came to \n     respect what I think are the most important qualities for \n     anyone who puts on a robe, no matter what court they will \n     serve on, but in particular the United States Supreme Court.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       As Judge Becker and others have alluded to, it is in \n     conference, after we have had oral argument and are not \n     propped up by law clerks--we are alone as judges discussing \n     the case--that one really gets to know, gets a sense of the \n     thinking of our colleagues. I cannot recall one instance \n     during conference or doing any other experience that I had \n     with Judge Alito, but in particular during conference, when \n     he exhibited anything remotely resembling an ideological \n     bent.\n\n  He endorsed Judge Alito in no uncertain terms.\n  Let me close by noting a few things I find encouraging. First, I am \nencouraged the attacks, distortions, and misleading claims about Judge \nAlito have not persuaded the American people. The leftwing interest \ngroups have thrown everything they have against this nominee. It is \nshameful the way they act. One of their leaders said at the beginning \nof this campaign: You name it, we will do it. That is the type of \nopposition this man has had to endure.\n  They did it. We have seen millions of dollars spent week after week \non petition drives, television ads, rallies, phone banks, and \ngrassroots lobbying. The net result of that barrage of propaganda has \nbeen that support for Judge Alito's nomination among the American \npeople has steadily increased--not a very good return on their \ninvestment.\n  In early November, Newsweek found that 40 percent of Americans \nthought Judge Alito should be confirmed. In December, even polls \nconducted for liberal groups found that support had risen to nearly 50 \npercent. And this month, polls by CNN, FOX News, and Reuters find \nsupport even higher with Americans backing the nomination by a ratio of \nmore than 2 to 1. A new Gallup poll conducted after Judge Alito's \nhearing last week shows support has risen by about 10 percent since \nearly December. This is particularly significant because Judge Alito's \nopponents have issued all sorts of apocalyptic warnings and \npredictions. They have cast Judge Alito as a radical extremist, a \nthreat to the environment and individual rights.\n  The Senator from Vermont has repeatedly said that all by himself, \nJudge Alito is a threat to the rights and liberties of all Americans \nliterally for generations to come. The critics have said that Judge \nAlito would give the executive branch a blank check to invade your \nprivacy, strip search children, and tap your phones.\n  According to the critics, if Judge Alito has his way, machine guns \nwill flood our streets, big business will pollute the air and water, \nand the poor and down trodden will be unable to find justice.\n  I am pleased to say despite all of this propaganda, as CBS News \nfound, the percentage of Americans having a favorable impression of \nJudge Alito has risen 50 percent since the end of October. I am also \nencouraged that not all Democrat leaders have abandoned reasonable, \ntraditional, judicial confirmation standards.\n  Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell, a past general chairman of the \nDemocratic National Committee, yesterday described a confirmation \nstandard that I hope his fellow Democrats would once again embrace.\n  He said that if a nominee is qualified and passes the test of \nintegrity, elections matter and disagreement with some of nominee's \npositions or decisions are not enough to deny the President his \nappointment.\n  That was the standard that allowed President Clinton to appoint two \nliberal justices with minimal opposition.\n  I wish my Democratic colleagues would follow Governor Rendell's lead.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I am encouraged that Judge Alito will indeed \nbe confirmed.\n  A highly qualified judge, a man of character and integrity, and \nsomeone who understands and is committed to the judiciary's properly \nlimited role, will soon join the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  When Judge Samuel Alito becomes Justice Samuel Alito, our system of \nlimited government under the rule of law will be stronger and the \nfreedoms that system makes possible will be more secure.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to confirm Judge Samuel Alito to the \nSupreme Court.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have Senators who wish to speak.\n  On several occasions, but publicly and privately, I have asked the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Utah if he purports to quote me, to \ntry to at least get within the ballpark of accuracy. I realize that is \nprobably a failing and useless request after hearing him misquote me \nagain the last few minutes, but I renew the request, and I hope that he \nwould do that.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. To suggest that I have said--I would like to find the \nquote where I said that Judge Alito, all by himself, would do away with \nall the liberties of Americans.\n  I see the distinguished senior Senator from Florida, and I yield to \nthe Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, some things can get hot here, \nparticularly when we get into personalities. Well, the senior Senator \nfrom Florida came here not to speak about personalities but to talk \nabout the substance of the issue in front of us.\n  In the Good Book, the Gospel promises all of us impartiality at \njudgment. And I would suggest impartiality--or justice for all--is a \nprinciple embedded deep in our constitutional democracy.\n  I believe in an America where courts address injustice and correct \nit. I believe in an America where our judges serve the people by \ninterpreting the Constitution, without agenda. I may have no greater \nresponsibility in the Senate than to be charged by our Constitution \nwith advising the President\n\n[[Page S82]]\n\non his picks for the U.S. Supreme Court. And in assuming this awesome \nresponsibility, I rise to oppose Judge Alito's confirmation to the \nSupreme Court.\n  Soon, the Supreme Court likely will hear cases about protecting our \npersonal privacy from Government and corporate intrusion and about the \nsharing of power between Congress and the President. These decisions \nwill have an important effect on each of our lives and on the future of \nour Nation.\n  In the break we had over the holidays, I had numerous townhall \nmeetings all over my State of Florida. The residents shared with me \ntheir thoughts about Judge Alito. So I took all of that information, \nand that is why, then, I carefully studied his record over the past 15 \nyears as a judge on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  During his time on the bench, Judge Alito ruled on cases ranging from \nthe rights of individuals to the stewardship of the environment. After \nhis testimony before the Judiciary Committee, and after studying his \njudicial record, I am concerned that he, more often than not, ruled in \nfavor of big Government and big corporations over the ordinary \nAmerican, putting trust in an authoritarian type of institution. That \nis a concern.\n  Following the hearings, I had the pleasure of personally meeting with \nJudge Alito to discuss my concerns. It was a very amiable and friendly \nconversation. He seems to be a very nice gentleman. But I explained to \nhim some of my concerns. I explained how a recent Supreme Court \ndecision has frightened many of our constituents who fear their homes \ncan now be seized by the Government to make way for a private \ndeveloper's project.\n  While he expressed sympathy for the parties whose homes had been \nseized, in this personal meeting with him, he offered no misgivings \nabout the legal reasoning that led to that outcome.\n  I am concerned about his rulings in other cases pitting the \nGovernment against individuals, in the area of the environment, \nworkers' rights, and racial discrimination.\n  In Public Interest Research Group of New Jersey v. Magnesium \nElektron, he, Judge Alito, established high barriers to prevent \nindividuals from being able to sue polluters for violations of the \nClean Water Act. The U.S. Supreme Court later rejected this reasoning \nby a vote of 7 to 2.\n  In Chittister v. Department of Community and Economic Development, he \nruled that State employees could not sue for damages to enforce their \nrights under the Federal Family and Medical Leave Act. The Supreme \nCourt later reversed this ruling by a vote of 6 to 3. I might say that \nboth of those acts under consideration by the Court I had the privilege \nof voting for when I was a Member of the House of Representatives.\n  And then in Riley v. Taylor, he ruled there was no basis for appeal \nin a death penalty case in which prosecutors had used their preemptory \nchallenges to exclude Black jurors from the jury pool. The full Third \nCircuit later heard the case and overturned Judge Alito's ruling.\n  These cases highlight the broader concerns I have with Judge Alito's \nrecord.\n  During my years in the Senate, I have voted for almost all of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees. All told, I have voted for 216 of \nthe President's 226 judicial picks, including Chief Justice John \nRoberts. That is 96 percent.\n  I greeted Judge Alito's nomination with an open mind. But his many \nlegal writings, his judicial opinions and evasive answers, both at his \nhearing and in my private meeting with him, convinced me that he would \ntilt the scales of justice ever so slightly against the average Joe.

Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Specter and Ranking Member Leahy: Americans \n     United for Separation of Church and State urges you to oppose \n     the confirmation of Judge Samuel A. Alito, Jr. to be \n     Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. \n     Americans United for Separation of Church and State \n     represents more than 75,000 individual members and 9,500 \n     clergy nationwide, as well as cooperating houses of worship \n     and other religious bodies committed to the preservation of \n     religious liberty. We oppose the confirmation of Judge Alito \n     to the Supreme Court because his record demonstrates that he \n     would fundamentally alter First Amendment law and immediately \n     put at risk many of the crucial protections for religious \n     minorities that the Supreme Court has recognized and \n     consistently enforced over the past sixty years.\n       Legal scholars have understood the First Amendment's \n     religion clauses as striking a balance between the religious \n     and political rights of individuals and groups within our \n     society. There is a necessary tension between the Free \n     Exercise Clause and the Establishment Clause, which serves to \n     balance the sometimes competing interests of individuals' \n     freedom of conscience against the requirement that the state \n     be neutral with respect to religious viewpoints. Justice \n     O'Connor has been successful in ensuring that public \n     expression did not turn into government favoritism or state \n     coercion of religious beliefs.\n       During his fifteen year tenure on the United States Court \n     of Appeals for the Third Circuit, however, Judge Alito has \n     shown himself to have a view of the First Amendment, \n     particularly of the Establishment Clause, that differs \n     dramatically from both Justice O'Connor's judicial philosophy \n     and the settled understanding of fundamental Establishment \n     Clause principles that has guided the Supreme Court's \n     decisions for at least six decades. Indeed, early on, Judge \n     Alito acknowledged his disagreement with the Supreme Court on \n     its Establishment Clause jurisprudence. When applying for a \n     position in the Reagan Administration Department of Justice, \n     Judge Alito declared that his ``deep interest in \n     constitutional law [was] motivated in large part by \n     disagreement with the Warren Court decisions, particularly in \n     areas [such as] the Establishment Clause. . . .'' As \n     evidenced by his longstanding appeals court record, we remain \n     concerned that such a motivation taints his view today.\n       There is much at stake for the future of religious liberty \n     as a result of Justice O'Connor's retirement and Judge \n     Alito's nomination to take her place on the Supreme Court. As \n     Justice O'Connor has recognized, it is vital that our \n     longstanding Establishment Clause protections remain in \n     place:\n       ``At a time when we see around the world the violent \n     consequences of the assumption of religious authority by \n     government, Americans may count themselves fortunate: Our \n     regard for constitutional boundaries has protected us from \n     similar travails, while allowing private religious exercise \n     to flourish. . . Those who would renegotiate the boundaries \n     between church and state must therefore answer a difficult \n     question: Why would we trade a system that has served us so \n     well for one that has served others so poorly?'' (McCreary \n     County, Kentucky v. ACLU of Kentucky, 125 S. Ct. 2722, 2746 \n     (O'Connor, J., concurring)).\n       In the Establishment Clause area, replacing Justice \n     O'Connor with Judge Alito likely would have a profound effect \n     on the religious freedoms that our dual constitutional \n     commitments to free exercise and separation of church and \n     state have long ensured. Both the straightforward holdings \n     and the underlying tenor of Judge Alito's decisions in \n     Establishment Clause cases contrast sharply with Justice \n     O'Connor's views. Throughout her career on the Court, Justice \n     O'Connor has been keenly attuned to the plight of religious \n     minorities in society as a whole, and most especially in the \n     public schools. But Judge Alito's focus has been elsewhere: \n     on religious majorities' ability to express their views \n     through governmental instrumentalities, at government owned \n     facilities, and in government-organized enterprises like the \n     public schools. Judge Alito has given broad license to \n     religious majorities to use the public schools and other \n     official settings to broadcast their religious messages \n     without regard for the competing rights and interests of \n     religious minorities.\n       Because Judge Alito has not extended the same protections \n     to all Americans that he has granted to politically powerful \n     religious majorities, the Senate should decline to confirm \n     his appointment as an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme \n     Court.\n\n[[Page S83]]\n\n       If you have any questions on Americans United's position on \n     this nomination, please contact Aaron D.

Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: On behalf of B'nai B'rith International \n     and our more than 110,000 members and supporters, we write to \n     ask that the confirmation hearings of Judge Samuel Alito \n     deeply probe the nominee's judicial philosophy with regard to \n     issues of great concern to our organization. Founded in 1843, \n     B'nai B'rith is America's pioneer Jewish agency, with a wide \n     range of domestic and international public policy priorities. \n     Included in our agenda are several issues that we would like \n     to ask the Judiciary Committee to raise with Judge Alito:\n       (1) Church-State Relations. We hope the Committee will ask \n     Judge Alito which judicial test should be applied to \n     determine whether a particular government action violates the \n     First Amendment's Establishment Clause. It might be helpful \n     to ask if the nominee feels it is permissible for public \n     school officials to lead students in prayer or scriptural \n     readings, or whether he believes that public funds and public \n     property may be used for religious displays. We also would be \n     interested to learn whether Judge Alito believes that a \n     statute or ordinance requiring schools to give ``equal time'' \n     to instruction in creationism or intelligent design would \n     violate constitutional principles.\n       (2) Asylum. B'nai B'rith hopes the Committee will ask the \n     nominee what standard should be applied to asylum claims by \n     individuals facing persecution in their homelands. We would \n     be interested to know what threshold of harm, or risk of \n     harm, a person fleeing a repressive society must demonstrate \n     before receiving asylum in the United States.\n       (3) Workplace Discrimination. B'nai B'rith would like to \n     hear Judge Alito's views on the standard that should be \n     applied to cases of age, disability, or sexual discrimination \n     in the workplace. It would be useful to know the nominee's \n     position on the burden of proof an older worker must meet to \n     demonstrate that he or she has been passed over for \n     promotion, denied accommodation, or unfairly rejected as a \n     job applicant because of his or her age or disability.\n       Thank you for your attention and consideration. B'nai \n     B'rith looks forward to remaining in communication with you \n     about this and other matters of mutual interest in the months \n     to come.\n           Respectfully,\n     Joel S. Kaplan,\n       President.\n     Daniel S. Mariaschin,\n       Executive Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n         Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations,\n                                Washington, DC, December 15, 2005.\n\nUnitarian Universalist Association of Congregations Urges Opposition to \nthe Confirmation of Judge Samuel Alito Jr. to the United State Supreme \n                                 Court\n\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the over 1,000 congregations \n     that make up the Unitarian Universalist Association, I urge \n     you to oppose the confirmation of Judge Samuel Alito Jr., to \n     the United States Supreme Court. After a careful review of \n     his decisions, and in particular dissents, we have concluded \n     that Judge Alito does not show sufficient respect for civil \n     liberties. His deciding vote on the court could undermine \n     fundamental rights for decades.\n       The decision to take a position on a judicial nominee is \n     not one the UUA takes up lightly--or frequently. Indeed, it \n     was only in 2004 that our highest policy-making body approved \n     language explicitly stating that the Association would oppose \n     nominees whose records demonstrated insensitivity to civil \n     liberties. We did not take a position on the confirmation of \n     either Judge John Roberts or Harriet Myers.\n       The nomination of Judge Samuel Alito Jr. is significantly \n     different, in that he has an extensive judicial record--more \n     than 15 years on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals--that \n     clearly reveals his judicial philosophy on a wide range of \n     issues. After extensive research, Unitarian Universalist \n     Association staff agreed that Judge Alito's rulings \n     demonstrate a pattern of views that were outside the \n     mainstream and hostile to established precedent favoring \n     civil liberties. In case after case, Judge Alito found \n     against the rights of individuals in relation to government \n     or corporations. In at least six cases, the Supreme Court \n     voted to overturn decisions of the Third Circuit or Alito's \n     dissent in Third Circuit cases. Several notable cases and \n     patterns are mentioned below.\n       Police Power: In the case of Doe v. Groody, Judge Alito \n     dissented from a Third Circuit ruling that police officers \n     had violated clearly established constitutional rights. \n     Police had strip-searched a mother and her ten-year-old \n     daughter while executing a search warrant authorizing only \n     the search of her husband and their home. Then-Third Circuit \n     Judge Michael Chertoff, now Secretary of Homeland Security, \n     held that the unauthorized search violated ``clearly \n     established'' rights. Alito disagreed, arguing that even if \n     the warrant did not authorize the search, an officer still \n     could have read the warrant as allowing it.\n       Religious Liberty: In the case of ACLU-NJ v. Schundler, \n     Judge Alito held that religious symbols displayed on \n     government property during the holiday season (in this case a \n     creche and menorah) were not unconstitutional when \n     ``secular'' decorations such as Frosty the Snowman and Santa \n     Claus were subsequently added to the display. While Justice \n     O'Connor has voted to allow secular holiday displays, she has \n     rejected efforts for religious symbols, including the Ten \n     Commandments, to stand alone in public display.\n       In ACLU of New Jersey v. BlackHorse Pike Regional Board of \n     Education, Judge Alito joined a dissent from the Third \n     Circuit's ruling which struck down a public school board \n     policy allowing high school seniors to vote on whether to \n     include student-led prayer at their school-sponsored \n     graduation ceremonies. In a subsequent case (Santa Fe \n     Independent School District v. Doe), the Supreme Court, with \n     Justice O'Connor in the majority, struck down a public school \n     board policy allowing students to vote on whether to include \n     student-led prayer at high school football games.\n       Limiting Access to the Courts: Among the most troubling \n     pattern is Judge Alito's consistent finding that plaintiffs \n     in discrimination cases did not have enough evidence to bring \n     their cases to trial. By denying even the opportunity for \n     judicial remedies, Judge Alito's philosophy undermines one of \n     the most fundamental checks and balances in our system of \n     government. For example:\n       Judge Alito has strongly disagreed with Third Circuit \n     rulings protecting the civil rights of African Americans. In \n     Bray v. Marriot Hotels, Alito disputed a ruling by Theodore \n     McKee--the Circuit's only African American judge--allowing a \n     race discrimination case to go to trial. McKee said that \n     Alito's position would ``immunize an employer from the reach \n     of Title VII if the employer's belief that it had selected \n     the `best' candidate, was the result of conscious racial \n     bias.''\n       Judge Alito has narrowly construed statutes in gender \n     discrimination cases. In Sheridan v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours \n     and Co., Alito was the only judge to dissent from a ruling \n     clarifying the nature of evidence permitting a jury to find \n     an employer engaged in discrimination. Alito's position would \n     have denied the plaintiff the opportunity to go to trial \n     despite significant evidence of discrimination.\n       Judge Alito's dissents would have made it harder for \n     victims of discrimination based on disability to prove their \n     cases. In Nathanson v. Medical College of Pennsylvania, the \n     majority lamented that under Alito's restrictive standard for \n     proving discrimination based on disability under the \n     Rehabilitation Act of 1973, ``few if any Rehabilitation Act \n     cases would survive summary judgment.''\n       Reproductive Freedom: Dissenting in Planned Parenthood v. \n     Casey, Judge Alito wrote that the right to reproductive \n     freedom does not prevent states from requiring women to \n     notify their spouses, except in limited circumstances, before \n     getting an abortion. Justice O'Connor cast the deciding vote \n     rejecting Judge Alito's position. Joined by Justices Kennedy \n     and Souter, O'Connor held that the provision Alito supported \n     harkened back to the days when ``a woman had no legal \n     existence separate from her husband'' and created an undue \n     burden on a woman's ability to obtain an abortion.\n\n\n                            We Are Not Alone\n\n       When the Unitarian Universalist Association makes a \n     decision to adopt a particular stance, we generally find \n     ourselves in the company of other religious organizations \n     with similar views. This holds true for our opposition to the \n     confirmation of Judge Alito.\n       In late November, the biennial convention of the Union for \n     Reform Judaism--the largest branch of Judaism in North \n     America--voted overwhelmingly to oppose Judge Alito's \n     confirmation, saying that it ``would threaten protection of \n     the most fundamental rights'' that the Reform Movement \n     supports. ``On choice, women's rights, civil rights and the \n     scope of federal power,'' Alito would ``shift the ideological \n     balance of the Supreme Court on matters of core concern to \n     the Reform Movement,'' according to the resolution adopted by \n     the more than 2,000 voting delegates from more than 500 \n     congregations in all 50 states.\n       Both our denominations reviewed Judge Alito's rulings and \n     found that his record did not support our stated values. The \n     Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations criteria \n     and supporting materials are available at http://\nwww.uua.org/. Materials from the Union for Reform Judaism can \n     be found at http://urj.org.\n       Liberty is at the core of our Unitarian Universalist faith. \n     Civil liberties are at the heart of our American experiment \n     in democracy. Those civil liberties guaranteed by the Bill of \n     Rights are as fundamental to our practice of democracy as \n     freedom of conscience is to our religion. We believe that \n     Judge Alito's philosophy does not sufficiently respect these \n     fundamental rights, and we urge you to oppose his \n     confirmation.\n           In Faith,\n                                                Robert C.

Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: Recognizing the profound significance \n     of the Judiciary Committee hearings on the nomination of \n     Judge Samuel Alito, Jr. to the United States Supreme Court \n     for the future of jurisprudence in the United States, Women \n     of Reform Judaism, comprised of 75,000 members in 550 \n     affiliates in North America urges you to oppose his \n     confirmation.\n       Women of Reform Judaism rarely opposes judicial \n     nominations. Its resolution ``Judicial and Executive Branch \n     Nominations'' adopted in 2004, however, emphasizes the need \n     for balance of legal and social perspectives on the federal \n     bench. This resolution also enables Women of Reform Judaism \n     to oppose judicial candidates whose record demonstrates \n     opposition to the core values, rights and principles \n     supported by our organization.\n       In his years in the Reagan Administration and on the Third \n     Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Alito has been a strong and \n     consistent voice for restricting women's rights, extending \n     police powers and destroying the wall separating church and \n     state in schools and in community religious displays. Judge \n     Alito has also taken anti-affirmative action positions and \n     has supported stringent barriers in discrimination cases. \n     Judge Alito's vote could be a crucial one on the court in all \n     these areas and more, replacing the balance provided by \n     Justice Sandra Day O'Connor with a marked shift that would \n     endanger the civil liberties and civil rights of the people \n     of the United States.\n       Committed to the precepts of our tradition and adhering to \n     the words of Deuteronomy, which tell us to pursue justice \n     (Deuteronomy 16:20), we look to the Supreme Court to protect \n     the civil liberties and civil rights of all Americans. Based \n     on his record, we are concerned that Judge Alito will be \n     unable to put aside his private views to dispense equal \n     justice for all and oppose his confirmation.\n           Respectfully,\n     Shelley Lindauer,\n     Rosanne M.

Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Specter and Leahy: As you consider the \n     nomination of Judge Samuel Alito Jr. to the Supreme Court of \n     the United States, we write on behalf of the Union for Reform \n     Judaism, encompassing 1.5 million Reform Jews in 900 \n     congregations across' North America, to express our \n     opposition to Judge Alito's nomination.\n       Our decision to oppose Judge Alito's nomination was not \n     taken lightly. During the debate on the nomination at our \n     recent Biennial General Assembly Reform Jews old enough to \n     remember the significant role the Supreme Court played in \n     extending basic human and civil rights to all Americans \n     cautioned the delegates about the danger of a Court whose \n     members have records in opposition to defending those rights. \n     Our Movement's youth spoke of cherished constitutional rights \n     that, with but one Supreme Court justice's vote changing the \n     balance of the court, could be undone, altering their lives \n     and those of the generations to follow. The older members did \n     not want to leave this legacy, and the youth did not want to \n     inherit it.\n       In 2002, the Union for Reform Judaism adopted a resolution \n     that established our criteria for considering nominees to the \n     federal courts. Under these criteria, which are not limited \n     to issues of character or professional competence, we will \n     oppose a nominee in those rare cases in which after \n     consideration of what the nominee has said and written, and \n     his or her record, a compelling case can be made that the \n     appointment would threaten protection of the most fundamental \n     rights which our Movement supports. Based on these criteria, \n     in November of 2005 we resolved to oppose the nomination of \n     Judge Samuel Alito Jr. to the Supreme Court of the United \n     States believing that:\n       Judge Alito's elevation to the Supreme Court would threaten \n     protection of the most fundamental rights which our Movement \n     supports including, but not limited to, reproductive freedom, \n     the separation between church and state, protection of civil \n     rights and civil liberties, and protection of the \n     environment;\n       On choice, women's rights, civil rights, and the scope of \n     federal power (particularly as it relates to civil rights and \n     environmental protection), Judge Alito's nomination has \n     sparked a national debate on one or more issues of core \n     concern to the Reform Movement so that the outcome of the \n     nomination is likely to be perceived as a referendum on that \n     issue and will have significant implications beyond the \n     individual nomination;\n       Many of his rulings have been contrary to our core values \n     and differed from the views of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor \n     (who was so often the moderate ``swing vote'' on a closely \n     divided Supreme Court), and, consequently, Judge Alito's \n     elevation would shift the ideological balance of the Supreme \n     Court on matters of paramount concern to the Reform Movement; \n     and\n       Judge Alito's elevation to the Supreme Court would likely \n     contribute significantly to reshaping American jurisprudence \n     in a direction that would jeopardize our core values.\n       Judge Alito's government service, and especially his \n     fifteen-year record on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, \n     provide clear insight into his judicial philosophy and \n     understanding of the Constitution. His rulings from the bench \n     in many areas of great import to the Reform Movement, and the \n     views he expressed while working at the Department of \n     Justice, demonstrate to us that he should not be confirmed.\n       As a religious minority, our community has historically \n     been committed to maintaining a strong wall of separation \n     between church and state. We see nothing in Judge Alito's \n     background to suggest he shares our commitment. In fact, in \n     his 1985 job application to the Reagan Justice Department, \n     Judge Alito wrote that one of the very reasons he became \n     interested in constitutional law was his ``disagreement'' \n     with the Warren Court's decisions regarding the Establishment \n     Clause. His opinions as a sitting judge have been consistent \n     with this claim. In ACLU-NJ v. Schundler, Judge Alito said it \n     was constitutional to have a holiday display consisting of a \n     creche (a representation of the infant Jesus in the manger), \n     a menorah, a Christmas tree, and other ``secular holiday'' \n     displays in front of the entrance to the main city government \n     building. Again evidencing his lack of commitment to \n     Establishment Clause values, in ACLU of New Jersey v. Black \n     Horse Pike Regional Board of Education, Judge Alito's \n     dissenting opinion argued that it was constitutional for a \n     public school district to allow prayer at graduation \n     ceremonies. Later, in a similar case involving school prayer \n     the Supreme Court disagreed. The statements in Judge Alito's \n     1985 job application and the aforementioned cases illustrate \n     his indifference (at best) to the constitutional protections \n     separating church and state; safeguards that have been the \n     linchpin protesting religious liberty for all Americans.\n       A longtime advocate for women's rights and reproductive \n     choice, the Reform Movement is also deeply concerned by Judge \n     Alito's views on reproductive rights. During his time as an \n     attorney in the Solicitor General's office, Judge Alito \n     helped author the Reagan Administration's amicus brief in \n     Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and \n     Gynecologists which argued for overturning the Roe v. Wade \n     decision. Judge Alito also authored a 17-page memo to the \n     Solicitor General on how to ``advance the goals of \n     bringing about the eventual overturning of Roe v. Wade . . \n     .'' Further, in his 1985 job application to the Reagan \n     Justice Department he wrote of his work in the Solicitor \n     General's office saying, ``it has been a source of \n     personal satisfaction to me . . . to help advance legal \n     positions in which I personally believe very strongly. I \n     am particularly proud of my contributions to recent cases \n     in which the government has argued in the Supreme Court \n     that . . . the Constitution does not protect a right to an \n     abortion.'' This dedication to the ``advancement'' of \n     reversing Roe is also clearly illustrated by his \n     dissenting opinion in Casey v. Planned Parenthood (1991). \n     Judge Alito would have upheld a provision of \n     Pennsylvania's restrictive anti-abortion law requiring a \n     woman to notify her husband before obtaining an abortion. \n     His colleagues on the Third Circuit disagreed and the \n     Supreme Court overturned the Pennsylvania provision (with \n     Justice O'Connor casting the deciding vote). The Court's \n     majority opinion found that the provision Judge Alito \n     would have upheld reverted back to the days when ``a woman \n     had no legal existence separate from her husband.''\n       So often our nation's courts ensure civil rights and civil \n     liberties that are otherwise unprotected by flawed systems \n     and discriminatory actions. In order to continue \n     administering justice and equality for all, individuals with \n     grievances must have access to the courtroom. Here, too, the \n     record suggests that Judge Alito does not share our \n     commitment to this fundamental principle. In split decisions \n     on the merits of claims alleging violations of the civil \n     rights of racial minorities, women, seniors, and people with \n     disabilities, Judge Alito has consistently ruled with the \n     defendants. In 16 of 24 such cases, Judge Alito has voted to \n     deny litigants the right to even bring their suit before the \n     court. For example, in Bray v. Marriott Hotels, involving \n     claims of race discrimination, the Court majority sharply \n     criticized Judge Alito's dissent, stating that his ``position \n     would immunize an employer from the reach of Title VII'' in \n     certain circumstances. In Public Interest Research Group v. \n     Magnesium Elektron, another case involving access to the \n     courtroom, Judge Alito again voted to make it harder for \n     citizens to establish standing to sue, this time concerning \n     toxic emissions that violate the Clean Water Act.\n       Judges, especially those selected to serve on the highest \n     court in our land, must be committed to upholding our \n     foundational principles of liberty and equality. Judge \n     Alito's record leaves us with serious doubts as to his \n     ability to safeguard these rights that we as a Movement, and \n     a nation, hold so dear. Here, with the stakes so high--a \n     lifetime appointment to the nation's highest court, replacing \n     a pivotal Justice who was often the ``swing vote'' in key \n     areas--we cannot afford such doubts.\n       We, therefore, urge you to oppose the nomination of Judge \n     Samuel Alito Jr. to the Supreme Court of the United States, \n     and we\n\n[[Page S85]]\n\n     stand ready to discuss our concerns with you or your staff in \n     greater detail.\n           Respectfully,\n     Rabbi David Saperstein,\n       Director, Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism.\n     Jane Wishner,\n       Chair, Commission on Social Action of Reform Judaism.\n                                                  National Council\n\n\n                                              of Jewish Women,\n\n                                                November 29, 2005.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Hart Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Specter: I am writing to you on behalf of \n     90,000 members and supporters of the National Council of \n     Jewish Women (NCJW) to express our strong opposition to the \n     nomination of Judge Samuel A. Alito, Jr. to fill the seat of \n     Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on the U.S. Supreme Court. We \n     have decided to oppose Judge Alito for many reasons, most \n     notably because of his record concerning the right to \n     privacy, his views on civil rights and women's equality, and \n     his support for weakening the wall of separation between \n     religion and state. In light of this record, NCJW believes \n     that Judge Alito should not be confirmed for a lifetime \n     position on the Supreme Court.\n       When Justice Sandra Day O'Connor announced her intention to \n     retire from the Supreme Court, NCJW called upon President \n     Bush to seek a mainstream consensus nominee that would unite \n     and not divide the nation. Instead, he has selected a nominee \n     who is deeply ideological with a demonstrated commitment to \n     pulling the court to the far right.\n       Judge Alito is clearly not a nominee in the tradition of \n     Justice O'Connor, who sought to balance competing interests \n     and adopted a pragmatic approach to the law. Rather, over the \n     course of his career, Judge Alito has ruled to severely \n     restrict a woman's constitutional right to abortion and \n     against civil rights protections for both women and \n     minorities. He has shown a cramped view of the power of \n     Congress to legislate, ruling, for example, that Congress \n     lacked authority to ban fully automatic machine guns and that \n     Congress overstepped its bounds in passing the Family and \n     Medical Leave Act.\n       With the withdrawal of the nomination of Harriet Miers to \n     the Supreme Court, it became clear that the extreme right \n     wing was determined to see a justice confirmed who would \n     implement their agenda from the bench. Judging from his \n     record, Samuel Alito appears to be just such a nominee. We \n     are extremely disappointed that the President chose this path \n     and gave in to those forces demanding a nominee dedicated to \n     rolling back fundamental constitutional rights, rather than \n     protecting them. We urge the Senate to reject Judge Alito's \n     nomination.\n       We applaud your intention to hold hearings that will \n     thoroughly explore Judge Alito's views and judicial \n     philosophy. While we hope that he will be candid in his \n     answers, the hearing is only part of the record that senators \n     must take into consideration as they determine whether or not \n     a nominee is fit to be confirmed to be an Associate Justice \n     of the Supreme Court. With the stakes so high, it is all the \n     more critical that the Senate take into account Alito's \n     entire record--not just his brief appearance before the \n     Judiciary Committee. President Bush must immediately turn \n     over all of the records requested by the senators. And Judge \n     Alito must now be forthcoming regarding his judicial \n     philosophy and views on settled legal questions.\n       NCJW believes that the most basic qualification for a \n     lifetime seat on the federal bench is a commitment to \n     fundamental rights and freedoms. What we know of Judge \n     Alito's record raises sufficient doubt that he meets that \n     essential qualification and therefore we urge the Committee \n     to reject his confirmation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Phyllis Snyder,\n                                                   NCJW President.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, nearly two centuries ago, Alexis de \nTocqueville observed that ``there is hardly a political question in the \nUnited States which does not sooner or later turn into a judicial \none.''\n  As was the nomination of John Roberts to replace Chief Justice \nRehnquist, the nomination of Samuel Alito to replace Associate Justice \nSandra Day O'Connor, upon her retirement, is an extremely important \nmoment for our Nation.\n  The Constitution makes the Senate an active partner, along with the \nPresident, in the confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee. Article II, \nsection 2, clause 2 of the Constitution states that nominees to the \nSupreme Court shall only be confirmed ``by and with the Advice and \nConsent of the Senate.'' The Senate's role in the confirmation process \nplaces an important democratic check on America's judiciary.\n  As a result, this body's consent is both a constitutional requirement \nand a democratic obligation. It is in upholding our constitutional duty \nas Senators to give the President advice and consent on his nominations \nto Federal courts that I believe we have our greatest opportunity and \nresponsibility to support and defend the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  In our consideration of the nomination of Chief Justice Roberts last \nfall, I stated my test for a nominee to the Supreme Court. It is a \nsimple test, one drawn from the text, the history, and the principles \nof the Constitution. As I said then, a nominee's intellectual gifts, \nexperience, judgment, maturity, and temperament are all important. But \nthese alone are not enough.\n  In addition, a nominee to the Supreme Court must live up to the \nspirit of the Constitution. A nominee must not only commit to enforcing \nthe laws, but to doing justice. A nominee must give life and meaning to \nthe great principles of the Constitution: equality before the law, due \nprocess, freedom of conscience, individual responsibility, and the \nexpansion of opportunity.\n  It is these principles that ensure full and equal participation in \nthe civic and social life of America for all Americans. A nominee to \nthe Supreme Court must make these constitutional principles resonate in \na rapidly changing world.\n  In my view, Judge Alito has not met this test. In his personal \nwritings from his time in the Reagan Department of Justice, he has \noutlined a view of the Constitution that is narrow, restrictive, and \nbackward-looking on issue after issue. He has pursued this vision \nthrough both the clients he has chosen to represent and the causes he \nhas chosen to advocate.\n  In addition, his opinions on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals have \nshown the impact of his personal philosophy on his role as a judge. Too \nmany times he has read constitutional clauses and statutes in a narrow \nand cramped way to protect the Government or big corporations instead \nof ordinary Americans. In case after case, and in his testimony before \nthe Judiciary Committee, Judge Alito has failed to show a commitment to \nprotecting the spirit of the Constitution.\n  Indeed, during his hearings, he had a chance to answer questions \nabout his prior writings and rulings in a clear manner. Instead, Judge \nAlito opted to speak in broad platitudes and failed to answer key \nquestions in a manner that would qualify or put in adequate context his \nprior writings and rulings.\n  Part of the genius of the Constitution that our Founding Fathers \ndrafted is that it fulfills two functions at once. It is a blueprint \nfor our Nation to govern itself through a system of checks and \nbalances. It is also a charter of the rights and liberties of the \nAmerican people. I am deeply concerned about Judge Alito's views in \nboth of these areas. Judge Alito's record on the Third Circuit shows he \nhas joined or agrees with a movement to undermine the ability of \nCongress to protect the American people through restrictive \ninterpretations of the Commerce Clause and the 14th amendment. The \nSupreme Court, in recent years, has struck down more acts of Congress \nthan ever before. By narrow 5-to-4 margins, in cases such as United \nStates v. Lopez and United States v. Morrison, the Court has drifted \nfrom longstanding Supreme Court precedents to invalidate portions of \nthe Gun-Free School Zones and the Violence Against Women Acts.\n  Judge Alito would go even further. In his dissent in the case of \nUnited States v. Rybar, he advocated striking down Congress's ban on \nthe transfer and possession of machineguns. Alito's opinion diverged \nnot just from the majority in his own Third Circuit but also from five \nother courts of appeals that had already found the law to be a \nconstitutional expression of Congress's authority.\n  Yet Judge Alito argued that he was not convinced by Congress's \nfindings on the impact of machineguns on interstate commerce. He \nsubstituted his own policy preferences in a way that the Third Circuit \nmajority found was, in their words, ``counter to the deference that the \njudiciary owes to its two coordinate branches of government.'' Every \nother circuit has since disagreed with Judge Alito's views on this \ncase, and the Supreme Court has concurred in these circuit court \ndecisions.\n  Judge Alito's divergence from mainstream constitutional views on this \nissue is particularly disturbing because it echoes personal views on \ncongressional authority he has expressed in other contexts. For \nexample, while\n\n[[Page S86]]\n\nworking in the Reagan administration, he argued in a memo that the \nTruth in Mileage Act of 1986 ``violates the principles of freedom'' and \nshould be vetoed by the President. This Federal law requires a seller \nto disclose the vehicle's mileage on the title when ownership is \ntransferred. Congress enacted this law to prohibit odometer tampering \nand to protect consumers from mileage fraud. Samuel Alito argued that \nit was the States, and ``not the federal government,'' that should \nprotect American citizens.\n  Not only does Judge Alito have an unusually narrow view of the \nCommerce Clause, it also appears that he would restrict Congress's \nability to pass laws under section 5 of the 14th amendment. This clause \nstates that ``Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate \nlegislation, the provisions of this article.'' Those provisions include \nsome of our most fundamental constitutional principles, including due \nprocess and the equal protection of the law.\n  Congress has acted under the authority of this clause to protect the \nrights of women and minorities, to ensure religious freedom, and to \nguarantee civil rights for the elderly and the disabled. But based upon \nhis writings and rulings, Judge Alito would severely limit the meaning \nof this clause. In Chissiter v. Department of Community and Economic \nDevelopment, he found the sick leave provisions of the Family and \nMedical Leave Act to be unconstitutional because he believed that 12 \nweeks of leave was ``out of proportion'' to the gender discrimination \nthat Congress wished to remedy. Here again, Judge Alito relied on his \nown policy preferences to strike down the measured judgment of \nCongress.\n  In the case of Nevada Department of Human Resources v. Hibbs, the \nSupreme Court explicitly upheld the family leave provisions of the act \nby a 6-to-3 vote. Where Alito had questioned the judgments of Congress, \nthe Hibbs majority, including Justices Rehnquist and O'Connor, found \nthat, in their words:\n\n       The [Family Medical Leave Act] is narrowly targeted at the \n     fault line between work and family--precisely where sex-based \n     overgeneralization has been and remains strongest.\n\n  The possible consequences of this tendency by Judge Alito to second-\nguess the policy judgments of Congress and to replace them with his own \npolicy preferences are profound. They go beyond any single act of \nCongress or any single area of policy. As just one example, this year \nthe Supreme Court will consider a pair of cases on the \nconstitutionality of the Clean Water Act. These cases challenge whether \nCongress can protect wetlands and tributaries through its commerce \nclause power. If the Supreme Court, with a recently confirmed Judge \nAlito, adopts a more restrictive view of the commerce clause and the \n14th amendment, it could limit our ability to protect our country's \nwetlands, let alone our national interests in area after area.\n  At the same time that Judge Alito has advocated for a narrower vision \nof Congress's constitutional authority, he has argued that the powers \nof the executive branch should be nearly unlimited. In a 2001 speech to \nthe Federalist Society, Judge Alito stated that since the 1980s, he had \nbelieved in the ``theory of the unitary executive.'' In the Judiciary \nCommittee hearings, Judge Alito denied any connection between the \nunitary executive theory and the scope of Executive power. But scholars \nand judges have drawn from this theory to advance expansive views of \nthe executive.\n  For example, in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, the Supreme Court reviewed the \nPresident's claim that he could indefinitely detain an American citizen \nwithout bringing charges or giving him a day in court to challenge the \ndetention. Eight of the nine Supreme Court Justices rejected the \nPresident's claim, and Justice O'Connor wrote in her plurality opinion \nthat ``a state of war is not a blank check for the President when it \ncomes to the rights of the Nation's citizens.''\n  In a lone dissenting opinion, Justice Thomas deployed the unitary \nexecutive theory to support broad Presidential powers. He wrote that \ncongressional or judicial interference in foreign affairs or national \nsecurity ``destroys the purpose of vesting the primary responsibility \nin a unitary Executive.''\n  In view of the long scope of American constitutional history, the \nunitary executive theory is a relatively recent invention. It was a \ncreation of the Reagan Justice Department in the 1980s. And according \nto his speeches, Judge Alito has subscribed to it since working there. \nWhile he worked in the Reagan administration, Judge Alito proposed a \nparticular idea to, in his words, ``increase the power of the Executive \nto shape the law.''\n  In a 1986 memorandum, Alito argued that the President should issue \nstatements when signing a bill because the President's ``understanding \nof the bill should be just as important as that of Congress.'' The \nadministration has followed Judge Alito's 1986 advice. For example, \njust recently, the President issued a signing statement regarding the \nMcCain amendment which prohibits torture. In that statement, the \nPresident wrote that he would construe the McCain amendment ``in a \nmanner consistent with the constitutional authority of the President to \nsupervise the unitary executive branch.''\n  The practice Judge Alito first advocated in the mid-1980s arguably \nhelps the executive to thwart the will of Congress when it passes a \nlaw. While the current Supreme Court has not given weight to these \nsigning statements interpreting the meanings of acts of Congress, I \nworry how a possible Justice Alito would view these Presidential \nstatements should they come before him on the Supreme Court.\n  I think Judge Alito's view of the unitary executive is wrong and \nviolates the text and the spirit of the Constitution. In Federalist \nPaper No. 47, James Madison explained how the Constitution deliberately \ndivided power among the branches of Government. Rather than create a \nunitary executive, the Framers created a careful and thoughtful system \nof checks and balances between all three branches of Government. They \nwere very weary of concentrating too much power in any one branch of \nGovernment. As the McCain amendment demonstrates, Congress plays a \nvital role in placing limitations on Executive power, but so do and \nmust the courts.\n  In the near future, the Supreme Court will hear further cases in this \narea. Perhaps the President's claimed authority to conduct warrantless \nsurveillance of Americans in violation of congressional statutes will \ncome before the Court. In this time of crisis in particular, we need to \nhave Supreme Court Justices committed to the balance and separation of \npowers between the three branches of Government. Despite Judge Alito's \nstatements that no one is above or beneath the law, Judge Alito's \nrecord and views on the unitary executive give me pause. If Judge Alito \nbelieves that under the Constitution the President can determine what \nlaws apply to him and how they apply, then he is essentially giving \naway the power of the Supreme Court as well as the power of Congress.\n\n  Ever since Marbury v. Madison, it has been ``emphatically the \nprovince and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is. \nThose who apply the rule to particular cases must of necessity expound \nand interpret that rule. If two laws conflict with each other, the \ncourts must decide on the operation of each.'' That settled doctrine, \nMarbury v. Madison, clashes with this notion of a unitary executive who \ncan declare the law for himself and thus make himself exempt from the \nlaw.\n  Judge Alito's support for a powerful and unitary executive is \nexacerbated by his 15-year circuit court record of repeatedly deferring \nto government officials when American's civil rights and liberties lie \nin the balance. As I mentioned earlier, this is the other function the \nFounding Fathers created for the Constitution. The Framers included the \nfourth amendment in the Bill of Rights to protect Americans against \nunreasonable government searches and seizures. It was a response to the \nabuses of the British in the years leading up to the American \nRevolution. Yet time and again, Judge Alito has deferred to police, \nprosecutors, and other governmental agents instead of ordinary \nAmericans.\n  Judge Alito wrote in his now famous 1985 job application essay that \nhe disagreed with the Warren Court's criminal procedures decisions. \nThese include famous cases in the development of American liberties--\nfor example, Miranda v. Arizona, which sets forth\n\n[[Page S87]]\n\nrights for the accused; or Katz v. the United States, which prohibited \nwarrantless electronic surveillance; or Gideon v. Wainwright, which \nguaranteed every American the right to a lawyer. There is little doubt \nthat Judge Alito's personal views in this area have carried over to his \ntime on the bench.\n  As Professor Goodwin Liu testified before the Judiciary Committee, in \nfourth amendment cases, Judge Alito has not one time taken a position \nmore protective of individual rights than his colleagues on the Third \nCircuit. These include cases where there were defective warrants, where \nagents conducted warrantless electronic surveillance, or where police \nused excessive force against unarmed individuals. Indeed, the \nWashington Post found that Judge Alito had sided with the government in \nthese cases over 90 percent of the time, whereas other appeals court \njustices nationwide only sided with the government 54 percent of the \ntime. In the face of government officials, the dignity, autonomy, and \nrights of individual Americans have carried less weight for Judge \nAlito.\n  As just one example, his dissent in the 2004 case of Doe v. Groody \nwould have upheld the strip search of a mother and her 10-year-old \ndaughter even though they were not named in the search warrant for the \nhouse. Judge Michael Chertoff, who wrote the majority opinion in the \ncase and who is now the Secretary of Homeland Security, said that Judge \nAlito's opinion of the case, if adopted, could ``transform the judicial \nofficer into little more than the cliche `rubber stamp.'''\n  Judge Chertoff's quote is an apt summation of my concern over the \nnomination of Judge Alito. American courts cannot become a rubberstamp \nblotting out the constitutional rights of our citizens. But from \nwomen's rights to workers' rights and reproductive freedom to religious \nfreedom, Judge Alito's writings and rulings reveal insensitivity to the \njudiciary's role in protecting the charter of freedoms enshrined in our \nConstitution.\n  The first amendment protects Americans' religious liberties through \ntwo clauses that work in tandem: the free exercise clause and the \nestablishment clause. I worry that if confirmed, Judge Alito would \nupset the careful balance the Founders sought in constructing the first \namendment. In fact, Judge Alito seems to interpret the establishment \nclause as a rarely applicable part of the first amendment. He applies \nthe free exercise clause on a much broader basis, often interpreting \nestablishment clause cases as free exercise cases. He seems to see a \nplaintiff's complaint of establishment clause violations as attempts to \nblock the free exercise of religion.\n  Judge Alito's views appear to have been developed well over 20 years \nago on these issues. In his 1985 job application essay, Judge Alito \nwrote that he disagreed with the Warren Court's establishment clause \ndecisions. These rulings prohibited government-sponsored prayer in \npublic schools, protected students who are members of minority \nreligious faiths, and prevented State interference with and \nentanglement in America's religious liberty.\n  Judge Alito's record on the bench supports a troubling view of the \nestablishment clause. For example, he joined a dissenting opinion in \nthe case of ACLU of New Jersey v. Black Horse Pike Regional Board of \nEducation, supporting student-led prayer at official, school-sponsored \nhigh school graduation ceremonies. The Supreme Court, in an opinion \njoined by Justice O'Connor, has since explicitly rejected this approach \nin Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe and as recently as last \nyear has sought a careful balance in establishment clause cases such as \nACLU v. McCreary County.\n  In summary, in ACLU of New Jersey v. Black Horse Pike Regional Board \nof Education, the Third Circuit majority determined that a student-led \nprayer at a graduation ceremony violated the establishment clause.\n  Judge Alito joined the dissent in arguing that the establishment \nclause does not prohibit a high school graduation prayer. The school \nboard involved had decided to allow graduating students to vote whether \nthey wished to have a prayer, a moment of silence, or neither at their \ngraduation ceremony. The students voted for prayer. Citing Wallace v. \nJaffree and Board of Education v. Barnette, the Third Circuit majority \nsaid:\n\n       An impermissible practice cannot be transformed into a \n     constitutionally acceptable one by putting a democratic \n     process to an improper use.\n\n  Judge Alito joined the dissenting opinion written by Judge Mansmann, \nstating that ``the establishment clause should not be read to prohibit \nactivity which the free exercise clause protects.'' The dissent argued \nthat the Supreme Court in Lee had not decided any broad constitutional \nprecedents against prayer at graduation ceremonies, stating the facts \nin the case were wholly different, as the graduates, not the principal, \nmaintained control over the ceremony, thereby avoiding the appearance \nof a state actor. The dissenters wrote:\n\n       The establishment clause should not be used for imposing \n     content-based restrictions on religious speech in a public \n     forum under the appropriate scrutiny analysis.\n\n  The dissent further criticized the Lemon test established in Lemon v. \nKurtzman, pointing to a ``division'' existing on the Supreme Court ``as \nto whether the establishment clause precludes the government from \nconveying a message that endorses or encourages religion in a generic \nsense, or especially acknowledges or accommodates the broad Judeo-\nChristian heritage of our civil and social order.'' It also concluded:\n\n       [A]n absolute prohibition on ceremonial prayer at \n     graduation would . . . violate the Free Exercise Clause by \n     unduly inhibiting the practice of religion, and would also \n     implicate the free speech guarantees of the First Amendment.\n\n  In another case, Child Evangelism Fellowship of New Jersey v. \nStafford Township School District, Judge Alito wrote an opinion \nrequiring a school to distribute a proselytizing religious group's \nliterature to elementary school students under the Equal Access Act. \nJudge Alito dismissed the school district's concerns that students \nwould perceive distribution of the religious fliers as endorsement of \nreligion. Again, Judge Alito's view in this area of the law differed \nfrom that of the Supreme Court. Justice O'Connor's opinion in Board of \nEducation v. Mergens, for example, carefully distinguished between \nrequiring access to school facilities--which was acceptable under the \nEqual Access Act--and requiring the active involvement of school \nofficials and teachers, which could have an inappropriately coercive \neffect.\n  Although I could discuss more cases, the basic point I want to make \nhere is that I believe Judge Alito would upset the careful balance \nbetween the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses of the First \nAmendment, allowing majority religious views to prevail over minority \nviews, and leading to an inappropriate Government coercive effect on \nreligious practice.\n  As Justice O'Connor states in McCreary:\n\n       At a time when we see around the world the violent \n     consequences of the assumption of religious authority by \n     government, Americans may count themselves fortunate: Our \n     regard for the constitutional boundaries has protected us \n     from similar travails, while allowing private religious \n     exercise to flourish . . . Those who would renegotiate the \n     boundaries between church and state must therefore answer a \n     difficult question: Why would we trade a system that has \n     served us so well for one that has served others so poorly?\n\n  I believe Judge Alito would make that trade.\n  Consider another area. The Federal Courts play an important role in \nenforcing American workers' access to fair and safe working conditions, \nwhile protecting their right to organize, and providing a forum for \nremedying wrongful discrimination. Yet, as a judge, Alito has \nconsistently tried to limit the reach of Congress' workplace statutes, \nand to make it more difficult for plaintiffs to bring legal claims. For \nexample, in RNS Services v. Secretary of Labor, the Third Circuit \nmajority found that the Mine Safety and Health Review Commission had \njurisdiction over the work and safety conditions of employees at coal \nprocessing sites. But Judge Alito disagreed, siding with the employer \nby interpreting the statute and case law restrictively. One academic \nstudy has found that Judge Alito has sided with the employee or union \nin only 5 out of 35 labor opinions he has written. These are decisions \nthat have real world effects on working people, as the recent mining \naccidents in West Virginia demonstrate all too clearly.\n\n[[Page S88]]\n\n  As far as a woman's right-to-choose is concerned, in his 1985 job \napplication, Samuel Alito wrote that he was proud of his work in the \nReagan administration advancing a ``legal position'' that he \n``personally believe[d] very strongly.'' Namely, that ``the \nConstitution does not protect the right to an abortion.'' Let me make \nclear, he did not say that he thought abortion was wrong; he wrote that \nthe Constitution did not protect a woman's right to choose. This is a \nview that he advanced as a lawyer and then a circuit judge, and that he \ndid nothing to dispel in his Judiciary Committee hearings.\n  In his work for the Reagan Justice Department, Alito wrote a memo \nwith a strategy for ``bringing about the eventual overruling of Roe v. \nWade'' by chipping away gradually at privacy and reproductive rights. \nIn the case of Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. \nCasey, Judge Alito used his dissent to argue for a constitutional \ninterpretation that would do just that, chip away at the protections \nfor the freedom to choose. The Supreme Court explicitly rejected \nAlito's opinion, with Justice O'Connor writing that the State ``may not \ngive to a man the kind of dominion over his wife'' that Judge Alito \nwould have accepted. Judge Alito's record in this area is long and \nclear, and I am disappointed that rather than openly answer the \nquestions of Senators on the Judiciary Committee, he responded with \nobfuscating statements about the judicial process.\n  The Supreme Court has been a leader in safeguarding all kinds of \ncivil rights, through momentous cases like Brown v. Board of Education, \nand through its application of historic laws of Congress like the Civil \nRights Act of 1964. Victims of racial, gender, age, or disability \ndiscrimination can find remedies in the Federal Courts. But from my \nreading of his record, Judge Alito has repeatedly used procedural and \nevidentiary requirements to make it more difficult for plaintiffs to \nvindicate their civil rights claims. One study of discrimination cases \nheard by Judge Alito in which the panel was divided concluded that he \nsided against civil rights protections 85 percent of the time, more \nthan any other judge on the Third Circuit.\n  For example, in the case of Bray v. Marriott Hotels, the Third \nCircuit said that an African-American woman denied a promotion in favor \nof a white woman, when the company had not followed its policy, should \nhave a chance to present her case before a jury. Judge Alito disagreed, \nsaying that this would ``allow disgruntled employees to impose the \ncosts of trials on employers.'' As the majority in the case noted, \nunder Judge Alito's view Title VII ``would be eviscerated.''\n  I know Judge Alito spoke in the hearings about his own family's \nhistory as immigrants to the United States. America's courts have \nplayed a crucial role in reviewing the immigration, deportation, and \nasylum decisions of the Federal Government and the Board of Immigration \nAppeals (BIA). As the noted conservative Judge Posner recently wrote, \nhis appellate court reversed the Board of Immigration Appeals 40 \npercent of the time last year, mitigating the at-times harsh, unequal, \nand unfair application of our immigration laws. In the hearings, Judge \nAlito said he agreed that the way BIA cases are handled ``leaves an \nenormous amount to be desired.'' Yet immigrants who have appealed these \ndecisions have found no place of refuge in Judge Alito's courtroom. \nAccording to one academic study, Judge Alito sided with the BIA in 7 \nout of 9 opinions he has written on asylum, and in 7 out of 8 other \nimmigration opinions he has authored. I believe that the spirit of our \nlaws and the history of our country require that immigrants to our \nshores are assured fair and full hearings.\n  In his application to the Reagan Justice Department in 1985, Samuel \nAlito wrote that his interest in constitutional law had been \n``motivated in large part by disagreement with Warren Court decisions'' \nabout voting rights. These landmark decisions, in cases like Baker v. \nCarr and Reynolds v. Sims, have enshrined the bedrock principle of \n``one person, one vote'' into our Constitution. They have protected the \nright of all Americans to have an equal share in our democracy, \nregardless of the color of their skin or the location of their home.\n\n  While Judge Alito backed away from these strong statements in his \nconfirmation hearings, his opinion in a voting rights case he heard on \nthe Third Circuit calls that statement into question. In the case of \nJenkins v. Manning, Judge Alito joined an opinion rejecting the \nAfrican-American plaintiffs' challenge to the voting system for the \nlocal school board. The dissenting judge in the case wrote that Judge \nAlito's side had ``overlooked the broad sweep of the Voting Rights Act \nof 1965 and its 1982 amendments'' which that judge noted ``is widely \nconsidered to be the most successful piece of civil rights legislation \never enacted by Congress.'' The Supreme Court continues to regularly \nhear cases about the ability of Americans to participate fairly and \nequally in our democracy, and I believe a nominee to the Supreme Court \nshould clearly and emphatically treasure and respect the Court's role \nin safeguarding voting rights, rather than minimizing it.\n  At the hearings before the Judiciary Committee, Judge Alito attempted \nto distance himself from his record and the constitutional views he has \nadvocated throughout his career. An attorney must vigorously serve the \ninterests of his client, but in the case of Judge Alito, he chose his \nclients--political offices in Republican Justice Departments--precisely \nbecause of the constitutional agenda it allowed him to advance. So, I \ndo not accept Judge Alito's plea that we should not evaluate him based \non the constitutional values he advanced through political positions.\n  I also have not been convinced by Judge Alito's vague rhetoric during \nthe hearings about following the judicial process, or his begrudging \nacknowledgment that important Supreme Court cases were indeed \n``precedents of the Court.'' While judges on the Federal circuit courts \nare circumscribed by Supreme Court precedent, there is no higher court \nto bind the Justices of the United States Supreme Court. Decisions of \nthe Supreme Court are binding on all lower courts, so even if a circuit \njudge disagrees with well-established precedent about the rule of law, \nhe or she must follow that law. But this is not true of the Supreme \nCourt.\n\n  As Justice Frankfurter once wrote:\n\n       It is because the Supreme Court wields the power that it \n     wields that appointment to the Court is a matter of general \n     public concern and not merely a question for the profession. \n     In truth, the Supreme Court is the Constitution.\n\n  It goes without saying that the constitutional views of the Justices \ndetermine the rulings of the Supreme Court. In response to questioning \nduring the hearings, Judge Alito pledged to put aside his personal \nviews. But in his writings and speeches, including his 1985 job \napplication, Judge Alito didn't just record his personal political \nviews; he wrote down his views about what the Constitution means--about \nwhat rights it contains, and what limits it places on Government. To be \nclear, this is exactly what it means to serve on the Supreme Court and \ninterpret the Constitution.\n  America's courtrooms are staffed with judges, not machines, because \njustice requires human judgments. This is particularly so on the \nSupreme Court. Of all the hundreds of thousands of cases filed in \nAmerican Federal Courts each year, only about 80 reach the Supreme \nCourt. These are the hardest of cases, cases that have divided the \ncountry's lower courts. These are cases where one constitutional clause \nmay be in conflict with another; where one statute may influence the \ninterpretation of another; and where one core national value may \ninterfere with another. These cases often divide the Justices of the \nCourt by close margins. Surely the Justices on both sides of a 5 to 4 \ncase can claim to be following the judicial process and respecting the \nprecedents of the Court. What divides their opinions is the set of \nconstitutional values that they bring to the case. Judge Alito's \ntestimony before the Judiciary Committee suggests a failure either to \nunderstand or to acknowledge the impact of his own constitutional views \non the outcome. of cases that he hears.\n  Given his lengthy record and his extensive statements about what the \nConstitution means, the burden was on Judge Alito to convince the \nSenate that he would be a judicious and balanced member of the Supreme \nCourt.\n\n[[Page S89]]\n\nThe questions he was asked by members of the Judiciary Committee gave \nhim numerous opportunities to do so. Judge Alito did not meet this \nburden. He failed to inform this body of his views on important \nconstitutional issues, he evaded fair and important questions instead \nof offering honest and insightful answers, and he in no way \ndemonstrated that he would uphold not just the letter of the law, but \nalso its spirit.\n  As a result, I cannot support his lifetime nomination to the highest \ncourt in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise this evening to discuss my vote on \nthe confirmation of Judge Samuel Alito, Jr., to the U.S. Supreme Court. \nAfter meeting with Judge Alito and studying his record and comparing \nhis answers to my criteria for judicial nominees, I have decided to \nvote against confirming Judge Samuel Alito, Jr., as an Associate \nJustice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  The next Justice will have the power to change the Court, change the \ncountry, and change our rights for generations. Judge Alito has a very \ntroubling record. In his hearing and in our private meeting he did not \nshow that he will be an independent judge who will uphold the rights \nand liberties of all Americans. With our rights and freedoms on the \nline, I will not take a chance on Judge Alito because I have serious \nquestions about his independence and his commitment to protecting our \nrights and our liberties.\n  As with past nominees, I have evaluated this nominee based on my \nlongstanding criteria, which ask: Is the nominee qualified, ethical, \nand honest? Will the nominee be fair, evenhanded, and independent? And \nwill the nominee uphold the rights and liberties of all Americans?\n  Personally, I got involved in politics because of another Supreme \nCourt nomination, that of Clarence Thomas. At the time, I was \nfrustrated that average Americans didn't have a voice in the process \nthat affects them so much. I have worked to be the voice of working \nfamilies in my State, and I have asked the questions they would ask. I \nam voting to protect their interests.\n  I recognize the significance of a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court. The \nConstitution directs Senators to provide advice and consent on all \njudicial nominees, and the people of my home State of Washington have \ntrusted me to be their advocate to safeguard their rights as I vote on \njudicial nominees.\n  I take that responsibility very seriously. That is why I have \nreviewed Judge Alito's past writings, studied his answers to the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, and asked to meet with him in my office.\n  A lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court is a tremendous grant of \nunchecked power. If the Supreme Court rules incorrectly, there is no \noption for appeal. There is no backstop. Any seat on the Supreme Court \ncan affect our rights for generations. But there are three factors \ninvolved in this particular nomination that make it even more \nsignificant. Those factors are the times, the seat, and the process.\n  First, I am well aware that we are living in historic times. Each \nday, it seems that the rights of the individuals and the power of \ngovernment are being tested. We are at war overseas, we face threats \nfrom terrorism here at home, and the current administration is pushing \nthe bounds of governmental power in remarkable ways.\n  The Bush administration has arrested U.S. citizens and held them \nwithout access to the courts. It has run secret prisons around the \nworld. It has expressed views on torture that put our own troops at \nrisk. As we recently learned, the administration has been spying on \nAmerican citizens without prior approval from a court. These are grave \nissues which will likely come before the Supreme Court. How that Court \nrules will affect the rights of our citizens, the balance of power \nbetween the branches of our Government, and the balance of power \nbetween our citizens and Government.\n  So as I make my decision on this nominee, I am very mindful of the \nhistoric times we are living in and the serious questions this Supreme \nCourt will address in the coming years.\n  Secondly, I am very mindful of the seat that is open on the Supreme \nCourt and its significance. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was a pioneer \nin the field of law, and her decisions will shape the lives of the \nAmerican people for generations to come.\n  As I said when she announced her resignation, we live in a better \nAmerica due to her 24 years of service on the Court. Justice O'Connor \nwas often a swing vote on those critical decisions. Her successor could \neasily change the balance of power on the Court, which could \ndramatically shift the Court's ruling on so many issues. Because this \nis a swing seat that could tip the Court's balance of power, we need to \nmake sure that the person we confirm is someone who will protect our \nrights and liberties.\n  Some have suggested that I should just go along and support the \nPresident's nominee. That is not the way I make decisions. I have \ncriteria that I use to evaluate all judicial nominees, and Judge Alito \nis no different.\n  Third, I am also well aware of how Judge Alito came to be the \nPresident's nominee. The President, as we all remember, had nominated \nhis counsel, Harriet Miers, to the High Court, but Ms. Miers was not \nacceptable to the rightwing of the President's party. I found it very \ninteresting that before her nomination, Republicans were demanding an \nup-or-down vote on the Senate floor for anyone the President nominated. \nBut when President Bush nominated Ms. Miers, suddenly we stopped \nhearing that urgent call for an up-or-down vote. In fact, Ms. Miers' \nnomination was killed by the President's own party, apparently because \nshe did not meet the ideological test of the extreme right.\n  I recount this history tonight not to diminish Judge Alito but to \npoint out that his nomination comes before the Senate in the context of \nan ideological battle that has been created by the rightwing. When the \nPresident nominated Judge Alito, the rightwing cheered, confident that \nhe would vote their way. That reaction gives me pause as to whether \nthis nominee can keep an open mind on the issues that come before him. \nIf the rightwing is so confident that he is going to vote their way, \nhow can all of us be confident that he will put our country's needs \nfirst? That alone does not suggest that Judge Alito cannot be fair, but \nit did lead me to explore those questions diligently.\n  Given the importance of the Supreme Court and the background of the \ntimes and the seat and the process, I began to evaluate how Judge Alito \nmeasured up to my standards for judicial nominees. Judge Alito's record \ncontains some disturbing statements, rulings, and pronouncements that \nrequire detailed explanations. Does he still hold some of those views? \nIn many cases, we don't know. I wish Judge Alito had been more \nforthcoming during his hearing. At the same time, many of the things he \nsaid and refused to say spoke volumes.\n  As I noted earlier, my standards are simple: Is the nominee \nqualified, ethical, and honest? Will the nominee be fair and evenhanded \nand independent? And will the nominee uphold the rights and liberties \nof all Americans?\n  I am very comfortable that Judge Alito is qualified, he is honest, \nand he is ethical. But whether he will be fair and evenhanded is \nanother question. And, as was discussed at his hearing, he does have a \ntroubling record for fighting for the government and corporations and \nagainst individuals. He seems to favor the entrenched power over the \nlittle guy. His record does not give me the confidence that everyone \nwho comes before the Court will be treated fairly.\n  I am also deeply concerned about Judge Alito's independence. We rely \non our courts as a critical check and balance against government abuse. \nThat independent check helps to protect our rights. This is especially \nimportant today because of the growing questions of the expansion of \nExecutive power.\n  The Supreme Court will need to evaluate whether recent Executive \nactions are constitutional. Here Judge Alito's unbalanced minority view \nof the scope of Executive power tells me he does not have the \nindependence to be an adequate check on the Government's abuse of our \nrights.\n  Finally, I have serious doubts that Judge Alito will uphold our \nrights and liberties. One example is his hostility\n\n[[Page S90]]\n\nto the right of privacy. In the hearings, he refused to say that Roe v. \nWade is settled law, and he did not adequately explain his 1985 \nstatement that the Constitution does not protect a right to an \nabortion.\n  Last year, when I voted to confirm, yes, Chief Justice John Roberts, \nI said I was choosing hope instead of fear and that Judge Roberts, \nthrough his answers, inspired such hope. Judge Alito, through his \nwritings, his rulings, and his nonanswers, does not inspire confidence \nin me that he will protect all our rights. Because so much is on the \nline, because I do not believe he will be sufficiently independent or \nwill uphold our rights and liberties, I will respectfully vote against \nhis confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a \nletter from teachers around the country who have opposed this \nnomination.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Society of American Law Teachers,\n\n                                                  January 9, 2006.\n     Re The Society of American Law Teachers' Opposition to the \n         Nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to the United States \n         Supreme Court.\n\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chair, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Specter and Leahy: The Society of American \n     Law Teachers (SALT) opposes--and urges all members of the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee to vote against--the nomination of \n     Judge Samuel Alito to the United States Supreme Court. SALT \n     is the largest organization of law professors in the United \n     States, representing more than 900 professors at more than \n     160 law schools. SALT has taken a position opposing only a \n     very few judicial nominations. It did not oppose the \n     nomination of Justice Roberts or Harriet Meirs. However, it \n     is deeply committed to civil rights, individual rights and \n     liberties, and an interpretation of federalism that retains a \n     robust role for Congress in protecting these rights. Judge \n     Alito's work in the United States Department of Justice and \n     fifteen year record on the United States Court of Appeals for \n     the Third Circuit evidence his disregard for all three. \n     Replacing Justice Sandra Day O'Connor with Judge Alito will \n     result in the Court shifting profoundly to the right.\n       A Knight-Ridder comprehensive review of published opinions \n     written by Judge Alito concluded that Alito has worked \n     quietly but resolutely to weave a conservative legal agenda \n     into the fabric of the nation's laws . . . [His] record \n     reveals decisions so consistent that it appears results do \n     matter to him . . . [He] rarely supports individual rights \n     claims. . . [and] often goes out of his way to narrow the \n     scope of individual rights.\n       While Judge Alito's opinions are devoid of explosive \n     language and appear to reflect a dispassionate application of \n     law to facts, he has used legal craftsmanship and existing \n     precedent in the service of predetermined results. As \n     Professor Lawrence Tribe has stated, ``I simply make a plea \n     to quit pretending that law, life and an individual's \n     assumptions about both can be entirely separated. . . .'' A \n     judge's values, beliefs and experiences do matter. Judge \n     Alito has undermined the protections of civil rights laws, \n     devalued individual rights, overturned or weakened federal \n     statutes, and narrowly reinterpreted precedent in the name of \n     dispassionate application of the law.\n\n                  Undermining Civil Rights Protections\n\n\n                       Employment Discrimination\n\n       Judge Alito has engaged in an effort to eviscerate the laws \n     that seek to remedy violations of federal civil rights. This \n     effort can be seen in particular in an evaluation of his \n     opinions in the area of employment discrimination. Judge \n     Alito has written opinions in eighteen employment \n     discrimination cases and has sided with the plaintiff only \n     four times, which includes one case in which he sided with \n     white police officers challenging an affirmative action \n     policy. He has evinced deep skepticism about the \n     legitimacy of most discrimination claims and an \n     unwarranted belief that discrimination is rare in our \n     society.\n       In three cases in which Judge Alito would have dismissed \n     claims of harassment, he displayed a lack of understanding of \n     the dynamics of harassment and hostile environment \n     discrimination and their impact on a victim's workplace \n     environment and psychological well-being. In one case, \n     writing for the court, he upheld the exclusion of a report \n     showing the harasser had previously harassed another woman \n     because ``the report in no way put the City on notice that \n     Dickerson was harassing Robinson.''\n       In another case, Pirolli v. World Flavors, Inc., there was \n     an undisputed evidence that an employee with mental \n     disabilities had suffered sexually motivated, physically \n     abusive workplace harassment. The trial court dismissed \n     Pirolli's claim, calling the quite horrifying harassment mere \n     macho horseplay. In a 2-1 decision, the Third Circuit \n     reversed and sent the case back for trial. Judge Alito \n     dissented, not because Pirolli had failed to meet the legal \n     standard for sexual harassment, but because his brief never \n     explicitly asserted that he suffered from a work environment \n     that a reasonable person without mental retardation would \n     find hostile or abusive, even though all the necessary facts \n     had been alleged. In other words, Judge Alito would have \n     dismissed the case for sloppy brief writing. Additionally, he \n     would have held Pirolli to a higher standard of \n     reasonableness than the law requires. Judge Alito would have \n     compared Pirolli to a reasonable person without mental \n     retardation. The Supreme Court had previously emphasized in \n     Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., Justice Scalia \n     writing for the majority, that the severity of the harassment \n     is to be judged from the perspective of a reasonable person \n     in the plaintiff's position--in this case, a reasonable \n     person with a mental disability.\n       Lastly, in a dissenting opinion, Judge Alito would have \n     excluded evidence crucial to the victim's discrimination case \n     in Glass v. Philadelphia Electric Co. Mr. Glass had worked \n     for Philadelphia Electric for twenty-three years and received \n     only one job evaluation less than satisfactory. He applied \n     for and was denied many promotions. The employer explanation \n     was based part in on the one sub-par evaluation Glass had \n     received. Glass tried to present evidence that during that \n     time period he was assigned to a position where he was \n     subject to racial harassment and a hostile work environment. \n     Amazingly, Judge Alito's dissent argued that allowing Glass \n     to tell his side of the story might cause ``substantial \n     unfair prejudice'' and, failing to do so was, in any case, \n     harmless error.\n       In several cases, Judge Alito would have granted summary \n     judgment depriving plaintiffs of their right to trial by \n     setting the evidentiary bar so high that it would be almost \n     impossible for a plaintiff to survive summary judgment. In \n     Sheridan v. E.I. de Nemours and Co., a hotel employee brought \n     suit for sex discrimination in the failure to promote her. \n     The District Court granted the employer summary judgment, and \n     the case was appealed to the Third Circuit. The issue was how \n     much evidence a victim of discrimination must present to get \n     her case to trial. In an en banc 10-1 decision in which Judge \n     Alito was the only dissenter, the majority overturned the \n     grant of summary judgment and sent the case back for trial. \n     The majority held that a plaintiff would survive summary \n     judgment if she made her prima facie case and presented \n     evidence of pretext to rebut the employer's evidence. \n     Judge Alito would have disregarded the evidence in \n     plaintiff's prima facie case if the employer presented \n     evidence of a non-discriminatory reason for its action and \n     would have required additional evidence of discrimination. \n     Judge Alito's approach misinterpreted a Supreme Court \n     case, St. Mary's Honor Society v. Hicks, regarding \n     litigants' shifting evidentiary burdens in Title VII \n     cases. The majority's interpretation of Hicks was \n     reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in Reeves v. Sanderson \n     Plumbing Products, Inc. Although the dispute in Sheridan \n     appears to be highly technical, it is central to whether \n     victims of discrimination will have their day in court.\n       In another discrimination case in which Judge Alito \n     dissented from the reversal of a grant of summary judgment, \n     the majority said, ``Title VII would be eviscerated if our \n     analysis were to halt where the dissent suggests.'' An \n     African American woman was denied promotion and alleged race \n     discrimination. The issue was whether the employer's \n     evaluation that a white woman was the best candidate was the \n     result of discrimination. In spite of conflicting evidence, \n     Judge Alito would have simply accepted the employer's \n     judgment of who was the best candidate. The majority accused \n     Judge Alito of overstepping his judicial role and acting as a \n     fact finder in resolving the conflicting evidence in favor of \n     the employer. Judge Alito's hostility toward some employment \n     discrimination cases was reflected in his dissent:\n       ``I have no doubt that in the future we are going to get \n     many more cases where an employer is choosing between \n     competing candidates of roughly equal qualifications and the \n     candidate who is not hired or promoted claims discrimination. \n     I also have little doubt that most plaintiffs will be able to \n     use the discovery process to find minor inconsistencies in \n     terms of the employer's having failed to follow its internal \n     procedures to the letter. We are allowing disgruntled \n     employees to impose the costs of trial on employers who, \n     although they have not acted with the intent to discriminate, \n     may have treated their employees unfairly.''\n       Taken together, these cases reflect a palpable hostility \n     toward plaintiffs in employment discrimination cases.\n\n\n                    Discrimination in Jury Selection\n\n       Judge Alito has written troubling opinions in two death \n     penalty cases where the defendants challenged jury selection \n     as reflecting discrimination. The cases are troubling for \n     three reasons. First, they reflect a general hostility toward \n     civil rights. Second, they suggest that Judge Alito is among \n     the most conservative judges when it comes to the death \n     penalty (whereas Justice O'Connor was frequently the swing \n     vote in capital cases). Third, one of the cases reflects \n     Judge Alito's hostility to the use of statistics to prove \n     discrimination. This hostility is most troubling because \n     statistics have been an important element of proof in \n     creating an inference of discrimination or a discriminatory \n     impact.\n\n[[Page S91]]\n\n       While picking a grand jury in Ramseur v. Beyer, the judge \n     announced that he was not randomly selecting jurors because \n     he was trying to pick a cross section of the community, \n     instead asking some prospective jurors, including at least \n     two African Americans, to sit separately in the body of the \n     courtroom. An en banc divided Third Circuit ruled against \n     Ramseur's claim of an equal protection violation. Judge Alito \n     wrote a separate concurrence, making the astounding assertion \n     that defendants have no constitutional basis to challenge \n     a grand jury when certain racial groups were treated \n     differently in order to get a cross section jury. Equally \n     dismayingly, he suggested that defendants may not be able \n     to assert rights of jurors who are the victims of \n     discrimination with respect to grand jury jurors (although \n     the right is clearly established for challenges to regular \n     jurors). Judge Alito reached well beyond what was \n     necessary to decide the case in order to present radical \n     ideas in dicta.\n       In Riley v. Taylor, the defendant was convicted of felony \n     murder and sentenced to death. Eventually he filed a motion \n     in federal court challenging his conviction on numerous \n     grounds, including that peremptory challenges were used \n     impermissibly to strike jurors based on race. The full Court \n     reversed his conviction, in part based on a violation of his \n     constitutional rights with respect to peremptory challenges. \n     Judge Alito filed a dissenting opinion. Ramsey presented \n     evidence that all three of the potential Black jurors were \n     struck in his trial and that prosecutors struck every \n     potential Black juror in all four murder trials held the same \n     year in Delaware County. Judge Alito completely discounted \n     the statistical evidence, writing that inferring \n     discrimination was no more reasonable than attempting to \n     explain why a disproportionate number of recent presidents \n     were left handed. As the majority noted, the analogy ignored \n     the underlying constitutional right and ``minimize[d] the \n     history of discrimination against prospective black jurors \n     and black defendants.'' Because of this history of \n     discrimination, courts have consistently held that, barring \n     another explanation by the defendant, statistics can aid in \n     proving discrimination. Judge Alito's approach would \n     completely discount reliance on statistics to help prove \n     discrimination and would fly in the face of years of judicial \n     decisions in discrimination cases.\n\n                Endangering Core Legal Rights for Women\n\n       In cases raising issues of gender discrimination, Judge \n     Alito has written troubling decisions in which he appears to \n     accept traditional notions of the subservient role of women \n     in society and to deny the separate rights of women to \n     control their own destiny.\n       Judge Alito's record, both prior to and subsequent to \n     joining the bench, reflects clearly that he does not support \n     the constitutional right to choose and that his elevation to \n     the Supreme Court would endanger this fundamental right. In \n     1985, while in the Solicitor General's office, he wrote a \n     memo offering his own strategy for using the government's \n     brief in Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and \n     Gynecologists to (1) advance the goal of bringing about an \n     eventual overruling of Roe v. Wade, and (2) in the meantime \n     to mitigate its effects by upholding even the most burdensome \n     barriers to abortion. In the same year, Judge Alito submitted \n     an application for a Justice Department promotion, wherein he \n     wrote that he was particularly proud of his contributions in \n     cases in which the government has argued to the Supreme Court \n     that the Constitution does not protect the right to an \n     abortion.\n       Judge Alito's record in the Third Circuit demonstrates that \n     he has sought to implement his earlier views. In a concurring \n     opinion rejected by the majority and subsequently rejected by \n     the Supreme Court in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, Judge Alito \n     would have upheld a requirement that a woman notify her \n     husband before having an abortion. He discounted the \n     liberty and bodily integrity of the woman while showing \n     great concern for the husband's rights. Judge Alito's view \n     that the spousal notification provision in the law caused \n     no undue burden to women suggests that he believes a woman \n     loses her autonomy rights when she marries. Even in two \n     cases concerning abortion rights protections which had \n     previously been struck down by the Supreme Court and in \n     which Judge Alito was compelled to follow precedent, he \n     wrote narrow concurring opinions to insure that there was \n     no language that might support the upholding of Roe or \n     inhibit the ability to further narrow the right to choose.\n       Just as Judge Alito has denied the liberty rights of women \n     to control their bodies, his decision striking down the \n     Family and Medical Leave Act demonstrates that he has no \n     understanding of the distinctive burdens women face in \n     juggling work and family. Likewise, his opinions have \n     demonstrated a lack of understanding of the dynamics of \n     sexual harassment and its detrimental impact on victims of \n     harassment. Even in cases involving fathers of unborn \n     children, Judge Alito's solicitude seems to apply only to \n     married couples. He has shown a lack of sympathy for \n     protection of people and couples who are unmarried. In an \n     immigration case, Judge Alito held that it was justifiable to \n     permit a husband, but not a fiance to contest a woman's \n     deportation to China where she fears coerced abortion of the \n     couple's unborn child. In another asylum case, Judge Alito \n     denied asylum to an Iranian woman who asserted she would be \n     persecuted for refusal to wear the traditional veil and for \n     her feminist beliefs if she returned to Iran. While \n     acknowledging that an asylum claim can be based on gender-\n     based persecution, Judge Alito was not convinced that she \n     would be willing to actually defy the authorities and \n     therefore suffer the severe consequences alleged. In other \n     words, a woman must show her willingness to become a martyr \n     in order to prevail in the typical gender-based asylum case.\n\n  An Expansive View of the Police Power at the Expense of Individual \n                                 Rights\n\n       Judge Alito has advanced an expansive view of the police \n     power. His 1985 application to the Justice Department \n     expressed his disagreement with Warren Court decisions \n     concerning criminal procedure. Since ascending to the Third \n     Circuit, he has in criminal cases consistently deferred to \n     state courts, police, and prosecutors. In particular, he has \n     written a series of decisions narrowing the Fourth Amendment \n     protection against unreasonable search and seizure. Judge \n     Alito has sat on at least twelve panels in which judges \n     agreed regarding a citizen's Fourth Amendment rights. In each \n     case, Judge Alito adopted the view most supportive of the \n     government's position.\n       One of the most troubling examples of Judge Alito's \n     expansive view of law enforcement authority is his dissent in \n     Doe v. Groody, where he voted to approve the strip search of \n     a mother and her ten-year-old daughter, even though the \n     search warrant obtained by the police did not name or refer \n     to either of them. As then Judge Michael Chertoff wrote, \n     Judge Alito's position threatened to turn the Constitution's \n     search warrant requirement into little more than a ``rubber \n     stamp.''\n       Other dissenting decisions of Judge Alito suggest that he \n     views individual and other constitutional rights as stopping \n     at the prison door. He would have upheld a Pennsylvania law \n     prohibiting certain inmates from having newspapers, \n     magazines, and photos of their family and friends. In a death \n     penalty case, Judge Alito wrote an opinion for the court \n     rejecting a claim of denial of the right to effective \n     counsel. In the sentencing phase of the trial, the attorney \n     had failed to look at materials he knew would be relied on by \n     the prosecutor, materials that would have revealed a range of \n     mitigation leads. The Supreme Court overturned Alito in a 5-4 \n     decision with Justice O'Connor in the majority.\n\n Extreme View of Federalism and Separation of Powers That Would Limit \n the Role of Congress in Protecting the Health, Safety and Welfare of \n    Its Citizens and Give Unwarranted Power to the Executive Branch\n\n\n                     Limiting the Role of Congress\n\n       Judge Alito has written two opinions that reflect an \n     extreme view of the limits of congressional power to pass \n     legislation. He voted to invalidate the federal prohibition \n     on machine gun possession and part of the federal Family and \n     Medical Leave Act. His decisions are consistent with his 1985 \n     application to be Deputy Assistant Attorney General, in which \n     he wrote that he ``believe[s] very strongly in . . . \n     federalism.\n       In United States v. Rybar, Judge Alito argued in dissent \n     that the federal ban on machine gun possession, which had \n     been on the books in some form since 1934 is unconstitutional \n     Commerce Clause legislation. The Commerce Clause undergirds \n     many of the most important civil rights, consumer protection, \n     worker protection and environmental protection laws. Judge \n     Alito argued that the majority's theory would lead to the \n     conclusion that Congress may ban purely intrastate possession \n     of just about anything. He rationalized his decision in part \n     by claiming that there were no congressional findings or \n     statutory bases for the law, thus imposing a new stringent \n     fact-finding requirement for Congressional justification of \n     its laws. He ignored common sense--the facts involved a \n     licensed gun dealer selling machine guns at a gun show--\n     transactions which involved interstate commerce. \n     Additionally, he ignored references in conference reports and \n     on the floor of Congress concerning the effect of the ban on \n     interstate commerce. Judge Alito's colleagues accused him of \n     institutional disrespect by requiring the ``coordinate \n     branches of government'' to ``play'' show and tell with the \n     federal courts at the peril of invalidating congressional \n     statutes. All of the other appellate courts which had \n     considered the law in the wake of United States v. Lopez \n     agreed with Judge Alito's colleagues, and all but one court \n     to have looked at the law since then has done the same. The \n     Supreme Court rejected Judge Alito's restrictive view of \n     Congress' lawmaking authority in Gonzales v. Raich.\n       In another case concerning Congress' lawmaking authority, \n     Judge Alito again advocated an extremely narrow view of \n     congressional power. Chittister v. Department of Community \n     and Economic Development involved a state employee who sued \n     for damages under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) when \n     his sick leave was revoked and he was terminated. Congress \n     claimed the authority to pass the FMLA under section 5 of the \n     Fourteenth Amendment on the grounds that the Act attempted to \n     remedy sex discrimination by allowing women to take leave \n     without sacrificing their jobs. Judge Alito held that \n     Congress does not have the authority to give state employees \n     the right to sue their employers for damages for violating \n     the FMLA. He rejected the justification that the FMLA \n     remedied sex discrimination and claimed that Congress had \n     failed\n\n[[Page S92]]\n\n     to make any findings that state statutes had discriminated \n     against women. The preamble to the statute explicitly states \n     that the purpose of the Act is to remedy sex discrimination. \n     There is of course, a long history of litigation striking \n     down state statutes disadvantaging women in the workplace. \n     Nevertheless, Judge Alito would require Congress to engage in \n     fact finding specifically directed at the FMLA. In a similar \n     challenge, Nevada Department of Human Resources v. Hibbs the \n     Supreme Court later held that state employees can enforce \n     their right to damages pursuant to a violation of another \n     provision of the FMLA.\n\n\n            Advocating an Expansive Scope of Executive Power\n\n       Since the Nixon Administration, the country has witnessed a \n     legal battle concerning the scope of presidential authority \n     under our Constitution. The present administration advances \n     an extreme, expansionist theory of the scope of presidential \n     power, both foreign and domestic. The theoretical \n     underpinnings for the concept of the ``imperial presidency'' \n     have been developed by writings of the Federalist Society. \n     Judge Alito's 1985 application to serve as Deputy Assistant \n     Attorney General in the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) boasts \n     of his regular participation in the Federalist Society, an \n     involvement which continues to this day. OLC, during his \n     tenure, was the source of extreme thinking about expansive \n     presidential power. For example, OLC opined that the \n     executive branch could ignore congressionally authorized \n     procedures for federal procurement and determined that the \n     President had constitutionally unfettered authority to \n     determine when to tell Congress of his covert initiative with \n     regard to Iranian arms sales--even though the power to \n     regulate foreign trade is an express congressional authority.\n       In other memoranda which Judge Alito wrote during his time \n     at the Justice Department, he argued in favor of expanded \n     government authority to intercept computer messages and \n     broader authority for government agents to set up shell \n     companies to help with undercover operations. He also told \n     the FBI that it was not bound by two district court decisions \n     restricting the Bureau's power to investigate employees whose \n     jobs were not critical to national security.\n       During his years on the bench, Judge Alito has been \n     extremely deferential to assertions of executive authority, \n     particularly in the area of criminal law, and has gone out of \n     his way to place limitations on Congress's legislative \n     powers. It is this line of thinking that has spawned (1) \n     unprecedented claims of executive privilege, (2) claims of \n     authority to engage in torture, (3) claims to hold U.S. \n     citizens indefinitely as enemy combatants and foreign \n     nationals as enemy combatants in Guantanamo Bay without any \n     right of review of that designation, and now (4) an apparent \n     pattern of flagrant violations of the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act by sanctioning domestic wiretapping without \n     obtaining a warrant.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       With the retirement of Justice O'Connor, the direction of \n     the Court stands in the balance. Judge Alito's record \n     demonstrates that he would shift the court radically \n     rightward. His vision of federalism and separation of powers \n     would dangerously expand the power of the executive and the \n     states; shrink the power of Congress to protect the health, \n     safety and welfare of this nation's citizens; and diminish \n     the role of the courts in guarding against discrimination and \n     undue government intrusion into individual rights. Justice \n     Alito's opinions show an alarming detachment from real life \n     and real people. His opinions are a historical and reflect a \n     lack of empathy for or appreciation of the human condition \n     and the role of courts in protection the rights of \n     minorities.\n       We urge you to reject the nomination of Judge Alito to the \n     Supreme Court.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Eileen Kaufman,\n                                                     Co-President.\n                                                    Tayyab Mahmud,\n                                                     Co-President.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today on this floor the distinguished \nSenator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, accused me of misrepresenting him when \nI earlier characterized comments he has made about the nomination of \nSamuel Alito to the Supreme Court. He would not yield to me at that \ntime, and I want to set the record straight.\n  This is how I characterized the Senator from Vermont's previous \ncomments: ``The Senator from Vermont, Senator Leahy, has repeatedly \nsaid that, all by himself, Judge Alito is a threat to the rights and \nliberties of all Americans literally for generations to come.''\n  The Senator from Vermont reacted by saying that I was not even \n``within the ballpark of accuracy.''\n  This reaction was particularly perplexing because the latest example \nof the Senator from Vermont making such a statement had occurred just \nhours before.\n  This time, I will be careful to quote, rather than characterize, what \nhe said. In his opening remarks today on the Alito nomination, the \nSenator from Vermont said: ``This is a nomination that I fear threatens \nthe fundamental rights and liberties of all Americans, now and for \ngenerations to come.'' That language is simply cut and pasted from the \nstatement as it appears on the Senator from Vermont's Web site.\n  The Senator from Vermont made the exact statement yesterday, during \nthe Judiciary Committee's business meeting at which we considered the \nAlito nomination. He said: ``This is a nomination that I fear threatens \nthe fundamental rights and liberties of all Americans now and in \ngenerations to come.''\n  I was not only in the ball park, I was standing on homeplate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, my time to speak is not until 6:15. Since \nthere is nobody else in the Chamber, I will proceed to speak on the \nnomination of Judge Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Judge Samuel \nAlito, President Bush's nominee as Associate Justice to the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  Judge Alito has the experience, intellect, temperament, and integrity \nrequired of a Supreme Court Justice.\n  He has more judicial experience than any Supreme Court nominee in 70 \nyears. In his 15 years on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third \nCircuit, Judge Alito participated in over 1,500 cases and authored more \nthan 350 opinions.\n  Prior to becoming a Federal appellate judge, Judge Alito established \na record as a tough Federal prosecutor while serving as the U.S. \nattorney for the District of New Jersey.\n  As the State's top Federal law enforcement official, Judge Alito \noversaw the prosecutions of drug traffickers, terrorists, and organized \ncrime figures. He also cracked down on perpetrators of environmental \ncrimes, creating a new position of Environmental Crimes Coordinator.\n  Prior to being unanimously confirmed twice by the U.S. Senate, Judge \nAlito proved himself to be an effective advocate on behalf of the \nUnited States while serving in the Office of the Solicitor General. \nThere, Judge Alito participated in more than 250 cases, arguing 12 \nbefore the Supreme Court.\n  In sum, Judge Alito has served as a judge on one of the Nation's \nhighest courts, as the top Federal prosecutor in one of the Nation's \nlargest Federal districts, and as an advocate for the United States in \nthe Office of the Solicitor General. His 30 years of public service \nspans the full breadth of the law.\n  Judge Alito is unarguably a highly qualified nominee. However, I told \nthe citizens of Colorado that I would also evaluate judicial nominees \non their judicial philosophy and commitment to the rule of law.\n  Specifically, I pledged to support judges who rule on the law and \nfacts before them--not judges who attempt to legislate from the bench. \nJudge Alito's judicial philosophy corresponds with that promise.\n  Judge Alito recognizes the limited role of the Federal judiciary, \nhaving observed that ``although the judiciary has a very important role \nto play, it's a limited role. . . . It should always be asking itself \nwhether it is straying over the bounds, whether it's invading the \nauthority of the legislature, for example, whether it is making policy \njudgments rather than interpreting the law.''\n  Like his view of the limited role of the judicial branch, Judge Alito \nalso recognizes the limits on the powers of the executive branch. \nSpeaking on his understanding of the ``unitary Executive,'' Judge Alito \nexplained, ``the idea of the unitary Executive is that the President \nshould be able to control the executive branch. . . . [I]t goes just to \nthe question of control. It doesn't go to the question of scope.''\n  Further, Judge Alito recognizes that ``[n]o person in this country, \nno matter how high or powerful, is above the law, and no person in this \ncountry is beneath the law.'' This statement reflects his commitment to \na principle so fundamental to justice in this country that it is carved \nin stone over the entrance to the Supreme Court: ``Equal justice under \nlaw.''\n  Consistent with the principle of equal justice under law, Judge Alito \ndoes not\n\n[[Page S93]]\n\nallow his personal opinion to decide the outcome of a case. He says \n``[a] judge can't have any agenda. . . . The judge's only obligation--\nand it's a solemn obligation--is to the rule of law, and what that \nmeans is that in every single case, the judge has to do what the law \nrequires.''\n  I believe that each of my colleagues would agree that judges should \nbe held to this standard. Yet, at the same time, some criticize Judge \nAlito's record for living up to it.\n  For example, in Doe v. Groody Judge Alito argued in dissent that a \nsearch warrant authorized law enforcement officials to search everyone \ninside a drug dealer's house, including the wife and daughter. Even \nthough he personally ``share[d] the majority's visceral dislike of the \nintrusive search,'' Judge Alito's unwavering commitment to the rule of \nlaw led him to do what he believed the law required, despite his \npersonal beliefs on the outcome.\n\n  In sum, Judge Alito will serve as an effective steward of the law and \nConstitution. His record evidences a deep respect for the separation of \npowers and other fundamental principles envisioned by our Founding \nFathers. I have no reason to believe Judge Alito will be deferential to \nanyone or anything other than the law and the facts before him.\n  As a representative of Colorado, I also appreciate the uniqueness of \nthe issues important to our State and the West. The departure of \nJustice O'Connor and Chief Justice Rehnquist marks the loss of a \nWestern presence on the Supreme Court.\n  Earlier this year, I asked President Bush to nominate a judge who \ncould capably decide issues important to Colorado and the West, such as \nwater and resource law.\n  When I asked Judge Alito about his understanding of Western resource \nand water law, I was pleased to learn that he grew to appreciate the \nimportance and complexity of these issues while working in the U.S. \nSolicitor General's Office. He assured me that he understands the \nuniqueness to the West of such issues as water rights, the environment, \nand public lands.\n  In conversing with Judge Alito, I couldn't help but be reminded of my \nmeeting with now Chief Justice Roberts. Judge Alito is a man of great \nrestraint, delivering thoughtful, careful, and thorough responses to my \nmany questions--a further reflection of his view of the limited role of \na judge.\n  Although America was already aware of Judge Alito's distinguished \nrecord, the Judiciary Committee hearings were helpful in shedding \nadditional light on his character, temperament, and integrity, \nparticularly in trying circumstances.\n  During the nearly 18 hours of questioning, Judge Alito was both open \nand candid. He answered 97 percent of the nearly 700 questions that \nwere asked of him, declining to answer only 3 percent. By comparison, \nJustice Ginsburg declined to answer 20 percent of questions. Justice \nGinsburg received 96 votes in favor of her confirmation.\n  Throughout the course of the demanding process, Judge Alito \ndemonstrated great patience, humility, and respect--all attributes of a \ntemperament desirable for a Supreme Court justice.\n  The hearings were also an opportunity for Judge Alito to set the \nrecord straight on scurrilous attempts to impugn his integrity. Laid to \nrest is the claim that he acted improperly by participating in a case \ninvolving Vanguard, his mutual fund company. Shares in Vanguard mutual \nfunds are not an ownership interest in the Vanguard company, and Judge \nAlito had no legal or ethical obligation to recuse himself. His \nultimate decision to do so--beyond what the law requires--should be \npraised, not attacked.\n  These and other attacks are nothing but thinly veiled attempts to \ndistract from the impeccable record of a highly qualified nominee.\n  Judge Alito's jurisprudence and integrity have been praised by major \nnewspapers, legal scholars, former law clerks, and colleagues from both \nsides of the aisle.\n  The American Bar Association unanimously awarded Judge Alito its \nhighest rating of ``well qualified.'' The ABA's stated criteria for \nevaluating nominees are ``integrity, professional competence and \njudicial temperament.''\n  The judges with whom he has served on the Third Circuit offer their \npraise. Judge Tim Lewis, a former Clinton appointee, commended Judge \nAlito for his role in discrimination cases. Judge Lewis, testifying in \nsupport of Judge Alito, said that ``if I believed that Sam Alito might \nbe hostile to civil rights as a member of the United States Supreme \nCourt, I guarantee you that I would not be sitting here today.''\n  Major newspapers across the State of Colorado, including both the \nRocky Mountain News and the Denver Post, offer their praise for Judge \nAlito.'''\n  The Rocky Mountain News says that Judge Alito ``personifies judicial \nrestraint'' and ``deserves confirmation. . . . He has refused to \nelevate his ideology above the rule of law while showing deference to \nthe crucial but limited role the Founders envisioned for federal \njudges.''\n  Commenting on the temptation for Democratic Senators to cave to the \ndemands of ``left-wing interest groups [who] portray Alito as someone \nwho should be under house arrest, rather than an accomplished nominee \nwith a distinguished resume,'' the Rocky Mountain News points out that \n``Senate Democrats have an opportunity to rise above the muck'' \nconcluding that ``Samuel Alito should be confirmed.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the January 9, 2006 Rocky Mountain \nNews editorial printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Rocky Mountain News, Jan. 9, 2006]\n\n                  Alito Personifies Judicial Restraint\n\n       No one seriously questions the qualifications of federal \n     appeals court Judge Samuel Alito to sit on the Supreme Court: \n     U.S. attorney, assistant to the solicitor general and the \n     attorney general, and a 15-year tenure on the 3rd U.S. \n     Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       Former colleagues, including Democrats, who worked with \n     Alito the prosecutor laud his insistence on defending the law \n     rather than pursuing a political agenda. Keep that in mind as \n     confirmation hearings open in Washington today. Liberal \n     interest groups and some partisan Democrats are up in arms \n     because Alito has served as a model of restraint.\n       And that's why the Senate should confirm Judge Alito to \n     succeed Sandra Day O'Connor. He has refused to elevate his \n     ideology above the rule of law while showing deference to the \n     crucial but limited rule the Founders envisioned for federal \n     judges.\n       On principle, the Senate should give the president \n     substantial leeway to appoint federal officials who share his \n     views. And while candidates for life-tenured positions on the \n     Supreme Court deserve thorough scrutiny, we are confident \n     that the hearings will let Alito earn the nation's trust.\n       On the bench, Alito has championed a government with \n     limited, defined powers. He has defended the First \n     Amendment's guarantee of religious liberty, ruling against \n     governments that denied Muslims and Indians their ability to \n     freely express their faiths.\n       In United States v. Rybar, he seconded the view articulated \n     by the Supreme Court in United States v. Lopez that the \n     Constitution's Commerce Clause does not give Congress \n     unlimited power to regulate private actions. And though in \n     Planned Parenthood v. Casey Alito wrote in favor of a \n     spousal-notification requirement for abortions that the \n     Supreme Court later rejected, his law clerk at the time, \n     self-described Democrat Jim Goneia, told the Las Vegas Sun \n     that he ``never had any clue what (Alito's) personal opinion \n     might be.''\n       His measured approach has not slowed the partisan \n     spinmeisters from lobbing scurrilous allegations--charging \n     everything from misogyny to racism. The left-wing interest \n     groups portray Alito as someone who should be under house \n     arrest, rather than an accomplished nominee with a \n     distinguished reums.\n       But Senate Democrats have an opportunity to rise above the \n     muck. We applaud their plan to focus on Alito's views of the \n     proper balance of power between the president and Congress. \n     Concerns about executive authority deserve special attention, \n     particularly as the Bush administration prosecutes the war on \n     terror.\n       Barring any stunning surprises, Samuel Alito should be \n     confirmed. While we will surely disagree with some of his \n     decisions, we're confident that they will be soundly reasoned \n     and reflect respect for both the Constitution and the law.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, Colorado's other major newspaper, the \nDenver Post, proclaims that there is ``no reason to block [the] \nSenate's Alito vote . . .'' On the threat of a Democrat filibuster, the \nDenver Post says ``we don't believe the arguments against Alito merit a \nfilibuster. . . . Alito has served capably on the 3rd U.S. Circuit \nCourt of Appeals for 15 years, and his confirmation should rise or fall \non a majority vote.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the January 17, 2006, Denver Post \neditorial be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S94]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Denver Post, Jan. 17, 2006]\n\n                 No Reason to Block Senate's Alito Vote\n\n       Judge Samuel Alito managed to navigate his way through last \n     week's Senate Judiciary Committee hearings without upsetting \n     supporters' high hopes or relieving opponents' high anxiety.\n       Though his testimony to the committee was never too \n     revealing, Alito demonstrated his qualifications for the high \n     court, and he's likely to be confirmed. We wish we could be \n     enthusiastic, but Alito's record is troubling in such areas \n     as reproductive rights, privacy and executive power. If he \n     rises to the Supreme Court, we hope Alito will follow the \n     letter of the law and not the call of ideology or the urging \n     of special interests. Associates who have worked with Alito \n     over the years offer welcome assurances that he can be an \n     impartial figure and not a clone of Clarence Thomas on the \n     far right side of the bench.\n       We tend to agree with Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who \n     said on Sunday, ``This is a man I might disagree with. That \n     doesn't mean he shouldn't be on the court.'' Like Feinstein, \n     we don't believe the arguments against Alito merit a \n     filibuster.\n       Alito needs a simple majority to win confirmation unless \n     opponents try to extend debate indefinitely; then 60 senators \n     must agree to a vote. Republicans have 55 senators, and many \n     are willing to ban judiciary filibusters if that's what it \n     takes.\n       In the end, Republicans will probably support Alito en \n     masse and most Democratic senators will vote no, reflecting \n     both parties' expectation of his future role. Much attention \n     is being paid to the ``Gang of 14,'' the coalition (including \n     Colorado Sen. Ken Salazar) that vowed to avoid filibusters \n     except under extraordinary circumstances. This isn't one of \n     them; Alito has served capably on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court \n     of Appeals for 15 years, and his confirmation should rise or \n     fall on a majority vote.\n       We hope Alito will moderate his views if voted to the court \n     of last resort. His statements about Roe vs. Wade suggest he \n     opposes abortion-rights, which we favor, while his support \n     for the ``unitary executive'' theory, which exaggerates the \n     powers of the president, is chilling given the current debate \n     on domestic surveillance and the balance of powers among the \n     branches of government. Some of Alito's dissents on the 3rd \n     Circuit inspire disbelief, such as his defense of a police \n     officer who strip-searched a 10-year-old girl whose father \n     was wanted on drug charges.\n       We urged President Bush to choose a centrist to succeed \n     retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, but once his first \n     choice, Harriet Miers, was blocked, it was inevitable that he \n     would seek out a nominee with proven conservative \n     credentials. That's Alito, to be sure. Wherever he serves, we \n     hope Alito exercises his approach to the law in a way that \n     affords Americans all the protections due under law and the \n     Constitution.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am pleased to see that these Colorado \npublications join me in recognizing that Judge Alito is the type of \njudge that Coloradans--and all Americans--deserve.\n  In conclusion, Judge Alito is one of the most qualified judicial \nnominees ever. He is deeply committed to the rule of law, he recognizes \nthe limited role of the judiciary, and he has the judicial temperament \nfitting of a Supreme Court justice.\n  The Senate debate should reflect that the job of a judge is to review \ncases impartially, not to advocate issues. Judges should be evaluated \non their qualifications, judicial philosophy, and respect for the rule \nof law.\n  It would be unfortunate and irresponsible for any of my Senate \ncolleagues to continue to politicize the judicial confirmation process. \nJudge Alito is eminently qualified, and he deserves a swift up-or-down \nvote.\n  I intend to vote in favor of Judge Samuel Alito's confirmation as the \n110th Justice to the United States Supreme Court and I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I believe that Judge Alito will not be an activist judge and supports \nlimits on the judiciary.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nattorney William Banta in which he discusses judicial independence, \njudicial activism, and judicial usurpation, now referred to by many of \nus as just judicial activism.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                                 Englewood, CO, September 6, 2005.\n     Re: A Lawyer's Duty--Judicial Independence, Judicial \n         Activism, and Judicial Usurpation.\n\n     Hon. Wayne Allard,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Allard: Recently there has been an outcry from \n     the established bar in defense of judicial independence. \n     However, very little has been said against judicial activism, \n     which used to be referred to as ``judicial usurpation''. \n     Because of the present tension between them, it behooves us \n     as lawyers to understand the relationship between judicial \n     activism and judicial independence. Marbury v. Madison is a \n     good place to begin.\n       While Marbury is typically used to justify a court's \n     prerogative to say what the law is, there is a discipline to \n     the case that is either overlooked or not discussed in polite \n     legal company. Chief Justice Marshall bases the Marbury \n     decision upon the American people's original right to \n     establish a constitution, the principles of which are \n     ``fundamental'' and which are to be ``permanent''. The case \n     itself involved three issues: (1) whether Mr. Marbury had a \n     right to his commission as justice of the peace; (2) if so, \n     whether there was a remedy available to him to secure his \n     commission; and (3) whether the remedy was a writ of mandamus \n     from the Supreme Court of the United States. Marshall said \n     ``yes'' to the first two issues and ``no'' to the third \n     issue.\n       The Chief Justice held that the Supreme Court lacked the \n     power to issue a writ of mandamus for Mr. Marbury's \n     commission because the Constitution did not provide for the \n     exercise of such original jurisdiction even though an Act of \n     Congress (the Judiciary Act of 1789) did. In ruling against \n     the Supreme Court's having jurisdiction, John Marshall \n     declared the obedience of courts to the Constitution, the \n     Constitution being ``a rule for the government of courts, as \n     well as of the legislature.''\n       To paraphrase Chief Justice Marshall, judges are subject to \n     the Constitution; the Constitution is not subject to judges. \n     The force behind the Marbury decision is the restraint and \n     responsibility required of the judicial branch.\n       Now I have a couple of questions regarding what some see as \n     attacks upon judicial independence. Does anyone think that \n     the public is criticizing courts because the judges on those \n     courts are thought to be following the Constitution? Or, are \n     courts being criticized because some judges are seen as \n     expounding politics instead of a constitution? It would \n     certainly be independent of any court to contradict the \n     Constitution, but it would also be unscrupulous and, to use \n     John Marshall's word, ``immoral'' of them.\n       Roger J. Miner wrote an admonition to us lawyers that I ran \n     across about seventeen (17) years ago: ``Should Lawyers Be \n     More Critical of Courts?'' Judge Miner's reproof was more \n     recently reprinted in The Colorado Lawyer: ``Judges'' \n     Corner--Criticizing the Courts: a Lawyer's Duty.'' To his \n     dismay, what Judge Miner had noticed was lawyers' \n     ``reluctance to criticize judge-made law, specific judicial \n     decisions, or the qualifications of individual judges''. He \n     quoted Justice Robert H. Jackson to the effect that the \n     public rightfully looks to lawyers (as the only group that \n     knows how well judicial work is being done) ``to be the first \n     to condemn practices or tendencies that they see departing \n     from the best judicial traditions''. Does anyone think, as \n     Judge Miner would, that the public has reason to be \n     disappointed in us lawyers for not being properly critical of \n     judges who deviate from their oaths to support the \n     Constitution that governs them?\n       As lawyers, we need to understand what is going on here. To \n     its credit, the established bar does not directly dispute the \n     right of Americans to criticize their judiciary. However, \n     only a very few lawyers have spoken out in defense of Chief \n     Justice Marshall's insistence on judicial scruples--the \n     established bar is more apt to rationalize, excuse, or even \n     defend in the name of ``judicial independence'' the conduct \n     of judges who act contrary to the language of the \n     Constitution. It is almost as if Supreme Court decisions were \n     infallible so that it would be irreverent of lawyers to \n     challenge them very much.\n       Not only Chief Justice Marshall but Chief Justice Harlan F. \n     Stone would not have it. Chief Justice Stone said, ``I have \n     no patience with the complaint that criticism of judicial \n     action involves any lack of respect for the courts. When the \n     courts deal, as ours do, with the great public questions, the \n     only protection against unwise decisions, and even judicial \n     usurpation, is careful scrutiny of their action and fearless \n     comment upon it.\n       The point is this: when a court takes it upon itself to \n     engage in politics, social experimentation, or baseless \n     lawmaking contrary to the Constitution, the American people, \n     if not the established bar, tend to hold that court \n     accountable. In holding judicial feet to constitutional fire, \n     critics are not threatening judicial independence; they are \n     reprehending those judges, those public servants, who \n     overstep their roles and thereby become ``activist''.\n       The purpose of the Constitution's Article III lifetime \n     tenure and undiminished compensation for Federal judges and \n     the purpose of Colorado's constitutional and statutory \n     provisions for judicial nominations, appointments, and \n     retentions are to insulate judges from political pressures as \n     much as practical . . . providing them with a measure of \n     independence to decide cases with restraint and impartiality. \n     Yet, if a judge commandeers the law, usurps the jurisdiction \n     of the other governmental branches, or overpowers the rights \n     of the people, is he not frustrating the purpose of judicial \n     independence?\n       That brings me to my last question: isn't the real threat \n     to judicial independence judicial activism itself? We needn't \n     have come to this pass had we, as lawyers and judges, \n     insisted on judges remaining faithful to ``the\n\n[[Page S95]]\n\n     best judicial traditions''. Too often we justified baseless \n     decisions on the unsteady promise of political results or \n     indulged the sentiment that the Constitution is whatever a \n     court says it is. Incidentally, to that utterance of Charles \n     Evans Hughes, Theodore Roosevelt rejoined that the \n     Constitution belonged to the American people and not to the \n     judges.\n       By not remarking the wrong of judicial activism all along, \n     the established bar must now be careful not to excuse \n     judicial activism in an ambiguous effort to preserve judicial \n     independence. The risk of confusing judicial activism with \n     judicial independence could compound our problem so that the \n     public comes to see the whole thing as a mess of our own \n     making. If that happened, the American people could demand \n     direct political control over those who had Wayne Allard lost \n     the self-control upon which Chief Justice Marshall insisted, \n     those who became unaccountable to the law they had taken an \n     oath to support.\n       To avoid such a misfortune, it might be a good idea to \n     revisit the instruction manual. Perhaps we could think about \n     whether the Constitution is our bedrock foundation or more \n     like a nomad's tent pitched on shifting sands. We might ask \n     ourselves whether we ought to dismiss the Constitution as an \n     outdated 18th century document or recognize that it was \n     designed in light of human experience and human nature to \n     endure for all time. And we can mull over whether our \n     Constitution should really be an adventure in judicial dead \n     reckoning or whether, instead, the written Constitution \n     provides a reliable compass, trusty sextant, and inspired \n     chart for the American people.\n       My impression is that commentators and many in the public \n     are way ahead of us lawyers and judges on these concerns. \n     Nonetheless, I hope that we are able to help out here so \n     that, as Judge Miner would prefer, ``the judiciary is \n     strengthened, the rule of law is reinforced, and the public \n     duty of the bar is performed.''\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                 William M. Banta,\n                                                  Attorney at Law.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have an item \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSenate Republican Policy Committee: Fellow Judges Testify in Support of \n                            Alito Nomination\n\n       On January 12, 2006, five sitting and two former judges \n     from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit testified \n     on behalf of Judge Samuel Alito's nomination to the Supreme \n     Court. The judges included nominees of Presidents Lyndon \n     Johnson, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and \n     Bill Clinton. Collectively they have served with Judge Alito \n     for more than 75 years, watching him work and evaluating his \n     intellect, character, independence, and judgment. Their \n     collective endorsement should be taken seriously by Senators \n     considering this nomination.\n       The judges included the following individuals. Judge Edward \n     Becker, appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1981, is a \n     Senior Judge on the 3rd Circuit and formerly its Chief Judge. \n     (Note: a Senior Judge continues to serve on the court and \n     hear cases on a limited basis; he is not retired.) Judge \n     Anthony Scirica, appointed by President Ronald Reagan in \n     1984, is the Chief Judge of the 3rd Circuit. Judge Maryanne \n     Trump Barry has served on the 3rd Circuit since President \n     Bill Clinton appointed her in 1999. Judge Barry also worked \n     in the U.S. Attorney's office with Judge Alito in the late \n     1970s. Judge Ruggero Aldisert, appointed by President Lyndon \n     Johnson in 1967, is a Senior Judge on the 3rd Circuit and \n     formerly its Chief Judge. Former Judge John Gibbons, \n     appointed by President Richard Nixon in 1970, served on the \n     3rd Circuit until 1990 when he retired to become a professor \n     of law at Seton Hall. As a federal prosecutor, Judge Alito \n     had argued cases before Judge Gibbons, and Judge Gibbons has \n     stated that he has followed Judge Alito's work since 1990. \n     Judge Leonard Garth, appointed by President Richard Nixon in \n     1973, is a Senior Judge on the 3rd Circuit. Judge Alito \n     served as his law clerk in 1976-1977. Former Judge Tim Lewis, \n     appointed by President George H.W. Bush in 1992, served on \n     the 3rd Circuit for seven years before retiring to enter \n     private practice, where he does significant work in civil \n     rights and human rights law. Excerpts from their testimony \n     follow.\n       Judge Becker on working with Judge Alito up close . . . \n     ``There is an aspect of appellate judging that no one gets to \n     see--no one but the judges themselves: how they behave in \n     conference after oral argument, at which point the case is \n     decided, and which, I submit, is the most critically \n     important phase of the appellate judicial process. In \n     hundreds of conferences, I had never once heard Sam raise his \n     voice, express anger or sarcasm, or even try to proselytize. \n     Rather, he expresses his views in measured and temperate \n     tones.''\n       Judge Becker on Judge Alito's intellect and open-mindedness \n     . . . ``Judge Alito's intellect is of a very high order. He's \n     brilliant, he's highly analytical and meticulous and careful \n     in his comments and his written work. He's a wonderful \n     partner in dialogue. He will think of things that his \n     colleagues have missed. He's not doctrinaire, but rather is \n     open to differing views and will often change his mind in \n     light of the views of a colleague.''\n       Judge Becker on whether Judge Alito is an ideologue . . . \n     ``The Sam Alito that I have sat with for 15 years is not an \n     ideologue. He's not a movement person. He's a real judge \n     deciding each case on the facts and the law, not on his \n     personal views, whatever they may be. He scrupulously adheres \n     to precedent. I have never seen him exhibit a bias against \n     any class of litigation or litigants. . . . His credo has \n     always been fairness.''\n       Chief Judge Scirica on Judge Alito's personal character . . \n     . ``Despite his extraordinary talents and accomplishments, \n     Judge Alito is modest and unassuming. His thoughtful and \n     inquiring mind, so evident in his opinions, is equally \n     evident in his personal relationships. He is concerned and \n     interested in the lives of those around him. He has an \n     impeccable work ethic, but he takes the time to be a \n     thoughtful friend to his colleagues. He treats everyone on \n     our court, and everyone on our court staff, with respect, \n     with dignity, and with compassion. He is committed to his \n     country and to his profession. But he is equally committed to \n     his family, his friends, and his community. He is an \n     admirable judge and an admirable person.''\n       Chief Judge Scirica on Judge Alito's openmindedness . . . \n     ``Like a good judge, he considers and deliberates before \n     drawing a conclusion. I have never seen signs of a \n     predetermined outcome or view, nor have I seen him express \n     impatience with litigants or with colleagues with whom he may \n     ultimately disagree. He is attentive and respectful of all \n     views and is keenly aware that judicial decisions are not \n     academic exercises but have far-reaching consequences on \n     people's lives.''\n       Judge Barry on Judge Alito's service as U.S. Attorney . . . \n     ``The tone of a United States Attorney's Office comes from \n     the top. The standard of excellence is set at the top. Samuel \n     Alito set a standard of excellence that was contagious--his \n     commitment to doing the right thing, never playing fast and \n     loose with the record, never taking a shortcut, his emphasis \n     on first-rate work, his fundamental decency.''\n       Judge Aldisert on Judge Alito's judicial independence . . . \n     ``Judicial independence is simply incompatible with political \n     loyalties, and Judge Alito's judicial record on our court \n     bears witness to this fundamental truth.''\n       Judge Aldisert on working with Judge Alito for 15 years . . \n     . ``We who have heard his probing questions during oral \n     argument, we who have been privy to his wise and insightful \n     comments in our private decisional conferences, we who have \n     observed at first hand his impartial approach to decision-\n     making and his thoughtful judicial temperament and know his \n     carefully crafted opinions, we who are his colleagues are \n     convinced that he will also be a great justice.''\n       Judge Garth on Judge Alito's lack of an agenda . . . ``I \n     can tell you with confidence that at no time during the 15 \n     years that Judge Alito has served with me and with our \n     colleagues on the court and the countless number of times \n     that we have sat together in private conference after hearing \n     oral argument, has he ever expressed anything that could be \n     described as an agenda. Nor has he ever expressed any \n     personal predilections about a case or an issue or a \n     principle that would affect his decisions.''\n       Judge Garth on Judge Alito's personality . . . ``Sam is and \n     always has been reserved, soft spoken and thoughtful. He is \n     also modest, and I would even say self-effacing. And these \n     are the characteristics I think of when I think of Sam's \n     personality. It is rare to find humility such as his in \n     someone of such extraordinary ability.''\n       Judge Gibbons on Judge Alito's independence from the \n     executive . . . ``The committee members should not think for \n     a moment that I support Judge Alito's nomination because I'm \n     a dedicated defender of [the Bush] administration. On the \n     contrary, I and my firm have been litigating with that \n     administration for a number of years over its treatment of \n     detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and elsewhere. And we \n     are certainly chagrined at the position that is being taken \n     by the administration with respect to those detainees.\n       ``It seems not unlikely that one or more of the detainee \n     cases that we are handling will be before the Supreme Court \n     again. I do not know the views of Judge Alito respecting the \n     issues that may be presented in those cases. I would not ask \n     him. And if I did, he would not tell me. I'm confident, \n     however, that, as an able legal scholar and a fair-minded \n     justice, he will give the arguments--legal and factual--that \n     may be presented on behalf of our clients careful and \n     thoughtful consideration, without any predisposition in favor \n     of the position of the executive branch.''\n       Judge Lewis on his own liberal politics . . . ``I am openly \n     and unapologetically pro-choice and always have been. I am \n     openly--and it's very well known--a committed human rights \n     and civil rights activist and am actively engaged in that \n     process as my time permits. . . .\n       ``I am very, very much involved in a number of endeavors \n     that one who is familiar with Judge Alito's background and \n     experience may wonder--`Well, why are you here today saying \n     positive things about his prospects as a justice on the \n     Supreme Court?'\n\n[[Page S96]]\n\n       ``And the reason is that having worked with him, I came to \n     respect what I think are the most important qualities for \n     anyone who puts on a robe, no matter what court they will \n     serve on, but in particular, the United States Supreme \n     Court.''\n       Judge Lewis on Judge Alito's honesty and integrity . . . \n     ``As Judge Becker and others have alluded to, it is in \n     conference, after we have heard oral argument and are not \n     propped up by law clerks--we are alone as judges, discussing \n     the cases--that one really gets to know, gets a sense of the \n     thinking of our colleagues. And I cannot recall one instance \n     during conference or during any other experience that I had \n     with Judge Alito, but in particular during conference, when \n     he exhibited anything remotely resembling an ideological \n     bent.''\n       Judge Lewis on Judge Alito and civil rights . . . ``If I \n     believed that Sam Alito might be hostile to civil rights as a \n     member of the United States Supreme Court, I guarantee you \n     that I would not be sitting here today. . . . My sense of \n     civil rights matters and how courts should approach them \n     jurisprudentially might be a little different. I believe in \n     being a little more aggressive in these areas. But I cannot \n     argue with a more restrained approach. As long as my argument \n     is going to be heard and respected, I know that I have a \n     chance. And I believe that Sam Alito will be the type of \n     justice who will listen with an open mind and will not have \n     any agenda-driven or result-oriented approach.''\n       Judge Lewis on why he endorses Judge Alito . . . ``I am \n     here as a matter of principle and as a matter of my own \n     commitment to justice, to fairness, and my sense that Sam \n     Alito is uniformly qualified in all important respects to \n     serve as a justice on the United States Supreme Court.''\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the attached \neditorial by the Arizona Republic, dated January 24, be printed in the \nRecord of this debate on the confirmation of Judge Samuel Alito to the \nU.S. Supreme Court. The editors' support for Judge Alito is welcome, \nand their statement that ``Judge Alito is a superior candidate for the \nhigh court regardless of his political leanings'' is absolutely true.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Arizona Republic, Jan. 24, 2006]\n\n                  Alito: Wise in the Ways of ``Whys''\n\n       If America is not on pins and needles over today's Senate \n     Judiciary Committee vote on Samuel Alito for the U.S. Supreme \n     Court, perhaps this Web site headline on Monday helps provide \n     an explanation:\n       ``Feingold unsure of Alito''--WSAW-TV, Wausau, Wis.\n       If one of the Senate's most solidly liberal members, Sen. \n     Russ Feingold, D-Wis., remains uncertain about President \n     Bush's nominee one day prior to his scheduled Judiciary vote, \n     prospects for derailing the nomination in the full Senate \n     would seem dim.\n       We'll see how the votes pan out. Still, it is worth \n     wondering: Where did the drama go?\n       The most obvious answer among many is that Alito is a \n     superior candidate for the high court regardless of his \n     political leanings. After 15 years on the bench, Alito has \n     established a lengthy track record as a fair jurist who has \n     struck a proper balance between his own constitutional \n     interpretations and those of other courts.\n       Even his obvious discomfort at the beginning of his \n     Judiciary hearings worked to Alito's favor. The candidate is \n     bookish and uncomfortable in the limelight? All the better \n     for a position on the nation's most deliberative, most \n     cerebral panel.\n       Many commentators have noted that the even-keeled Alito \n     presents himself far differently from Robert Bork, the \n     famously rejected conservative nominee of 1987.\n       Well, yes. Alito was not combative in the face of \n     relentless grilling, as Bork was. And he wears no wicked-\n     looking beard.\n       But it would seem that Alito's imminent success is less a \n     matter of televised theatrics, facial adornment or even \n     judicial philosophy than it is a reflection of the public's \n     expectations of a jurist.\n       Unquestionably, the public wants jurists to be fair, and it \n     seems to believe that Alito will live up to that standard. \n     The public wants a jurist who respects the judgment of other \n     courts, but it also wants one who understands that Job 1 is \n     to interpret the Constitution.\n       Sometimes, Supreme Court judges have found those two \n     directives in conflict. The public, and most of the senators \n     who represent it, seems to believe Alito will find his way \n     through those conflicts fairly and intelligently.\n       But most of all, Alito appears to have won over converts \n     because he has demonstrated the trait that increasingly seems \n     to distinguish great jurists from mediocre-to-good ones: He \n     can explain why.\n       We all wish to know why. With all due respect to President \n     Bush's previous nominee, Harriet Miers, it was not enough \n     that--wink, wink--her vote on the ``right'' issues was \n     ensured. Indeed, that constituted the most damning argument \n     against her.\n       Alito, by contrast, has won support because senators \n     believe that his decisions will be grounded and argued in the \n     facts of the law, not in some predisposed political prejudice \n     that is unsupported by the case before him.\n       And that is a powerful argument for Alito all by itself.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in support of Judge Alito's nomination \nto the Supreme Court and urge my colleagues to quickly confirm him.\n  I begin by observing that the party-line vote in the Judiciary \nCommittee yesterday raises a troubling question for the full Senate, \nand it is basic to our deliberations. What is the proper test for \ndetermining whether to confirm a nominee to the Supreme Court? Until \nvery recently, the Senate has evaluated whether the nominee was \nqualified--that is, whether he or she possessed the requisite \nexperience, integrity, and temperament to serve. But a new test has \nbeen proposed by Judiciary Committee Democrats: will the nominee \nprovide assurances that he or she will rule a particular way on cases \nsure to come before the Court?\n  Before I discuss the ramifications of that troubling question, \nthough, I would like to apply the traditional test--the proper test--to \nthe nominee before us.\n  A Supreme Court Justice should be an experienced judge. Samuel Alito \nhas more Federal judicial experience than all but one nominee in U.S. \nhistory, Horace Lurton, who was nominated by President Taft. In 15 \nyears of service, Judge Alito has authored more than 360 opinions and \nparticipated in more than 4,800 decisions. It is an extensive record.\n  A Supreme Court Justice should be deeply familiar with American \nconstitutional law. Judge Alito has spent his entire professional life \ngrappling with constitutional jurisprudence--serving as a Federal \nprosecutor at both the trial and appellate level, as the government's \nlawyer before the Supreme Court, and as a constitutional lawyer in the \nJustice Department before becoming a judge. Nobody who watched Judge \nAlito's testimony would deny that he is a brilliant legal thinker with \na deep and textured understanding of our Nation's jurisprudence.\n  A Supreme Court Justice should have unassailable integrity. Here, I \nlook to those who know him best.\n  First, the American Bar Association, in finding him unanimously \n``well-qualified'' to serve, conducted more than 300 interviews with \npeople who know Judge Alito on a professional and personal basis. They \nhave reported that the high praise for Judge Alito's integrity was \n``consistent and virtually unanimous.'' I repeat, it was ``unanimous.''\n  Second, let's look at what the judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Third Circuit had to say. Seven current and former judges \ntestified on Judge Alito's behalf--judges who were nominated by \nPresidents Johnson, Nixon, Reagan, the first President Bush, and \nClinton. Collectively, they have served with Judge Alito for more than \n75 years. They praised his fairness, his integrity, his open-\nmindedness, his temperament, his intellect, and his devotion to the \nrule of law.\n  Finally, a Supreme Court Justice must know the difference between the \njudicial role and the legislative or executive function. This \nqualification is sometimes difficult to decipher, but there are several \nclues that can guide us.\n  First, a long judicial record helps, and Judge Alito gives us that. \nThere is not a trace of judicial activism in his record.\n  Second, a judge cannot have a policy agenda. He or she must defer to \nthe political branches on policy questions. Judge Alito agreed, \ntestifying, ``We [judges] are not policymakers and we shouldn't be \nimplementing any sort of policy agenda or policy preferences that we \nhave.'' Judge Alito's colleagues on the Third Circuit appeals court \nconfirmed this. For example, Judge Aldisert testified that ``at no time \nduring the 15 years that Judge Alito has served with me and with our \ncolleagues on the court, and the countless number of times that we have \nsat together in private conference after hearing oral argument, has he \never expressed anything that could be described as an agenda.''\n  Third, a judge must not twist statutes or constitutional provisions \nto reach a result he favors. As Judge Alito testified, ``Judges don't \nhave the authority to change the Constitution. The whole theory of \njudicial review . . . is contrary to that notion.'' In\n\n[[Page S97]]\n\nother words, a judge must accept that the Constitution will sometimes \nrequire him to make rulings that he might disagree with. Politicians \nare free to vote their convictions; judges must put their personal \nviews aside. I will have more to say about this issue in a few moments.\n  Fourth, the judge must have the right understanding of the ``living \nConstitution.'' Our Constitution must always remain alive to new \nsituations that the Founders did not contemplate. But the judge must \napply the constitutional provisions in the way that most closely \napproximates the meaning of the text and the underlying principles as \nunderstood when drafted. The Constitution is not infinitely malleable. \nIt is not a blank slate for the judicial branch to draw upon. It has no \n``trajectory'' or ``evolutionary theme.'' It is a text--words with \nmeanings. If the Constitution can be twisted to mean anything, then it \nultimately means nothing, and then we live under the rule of judges, \nnot the rule of law.\n  Judge Alito respects the proper divisions within American \nconstitutional government. As he explained in his testimony, the \njudiciary ``should always be asking itself whether it is straying over \nthe bounds, whether it's invading the authority of the legislature [or] \nmaking policy judgments other than interpreting the law.'' He \nemphasized that judges have a duty to police themselves through what he \ncalled the ``constant process of re-examination on the part of the \njudges.'' If all judges engaged in this process of re-examination, the \nquality of justice in this Nation would improve dramatically.\n  Judge Samuel Alito is not going to legislate from the bench or bend \nthe Constitution to suit any political preferences that he might have. \nHe is not going to rely on foreign law, but will look to our American \ntraditions. He is not going to apply the Constitution as he wishes it \nmight be, but as it is written. In exercising this judicial restraint, \nJudge Alito will protect the people's ability to govern themselves--and \nthat is ultimately what is at stake.\n  That is why I support Judge Alito. Here is a man who is the son of an \nimmigrant, comes from a modest background, and has a keen sense of \npatriotic duty. He is highly intelligent, undeniably experienced, and \nimbued with character and personal integrity. He has a low-key, \npatient, and respectful personality--the model of what we have come to \ncall the ``judicial temperament.'' He believes in judicial restraint \nand has proven it for the past 15 years. He deserves my vote and I will \nproudly give it to him.\n  This is the analysis we have applied in the past, and its application \nhas resulted in confirmation for most nominees. It was certainly the \nanalysis used to evaluate President Clinton's nominees to the Supreme \nCourt. So it is in this context that I want to discuss what is evolving \nas a new test--a ``results-oriented'' test.\n  The minority members of the Judiciary Committee did not question \nJudge Alito's qualifications. Rather, they tried to get him to commit \nto certain results in cases that are sure to come before the courts. \nThey want to see certain policy goals enacted into law. Now, we all \nwant our policy goals to become law, but our aim should be enacting \nconstitutional legislation, not relying on the courts to enact our \npolicy preferences.\n  In my September statement supporting Judge Roberts, I explained that \nthis same dynamic had played itself out during his hearings. It is \napparent that there is now a fundamental difference between the \nmajority and the minority parties on this matter. We believe the courts \nshould not try to impose policy results in their decisions; they should \njust decide the questions of statutory interpretation and \nconstitutional meaning.\n  For the Supreme Court, the results are--or should be--simply a \nfunction of the proper application of the Constitution and law to the \nfacts of each case.\n  To the minority, however, that's not enough. As many minority \nSenators have expressed, they are not going to vote for a nominee who \nwill not assure them that he will vote the way they want in future \ncases. I submit that that is wrong. As Judge Alito testified, \n``Results-oriented jurisprudence is never justified because it is not \nour job to produce particular results.''\n  Yesterday's meeting of the Judiciary Committee illustrates that many \nSenators have adopted this results-oriented approach to the \nconfirmation process. The wrong questions are being asked, and the \nwrong answers are being demanded. The right question is how the nominee \nwill do his job, not what the nominee will decide. This fundamental \npoint is getting more and more lost with each passing confirmation \nbattle.\n  Let me give a few examples. Yesterday a Senator said that it was \nnecessary to vote against Judge Alito because that Senator believes in \na right to abortion and there is no guarantee that Judge Alito will \nagree with that position in a future case dealing with abortion \nregulations.\n  That Senator took the same approach when discussing the just-decided \ncase of Gonzales v. Oregon, which dealt with the Attorney General's \npromulgation of regulations in response to a state physician-assisted \nsuicide statute. The Attorney General had said that, despite the Oregon \nstatute, physicians could not use Federally regulated drugs to kill \npatients.\n  The case, therefore, did not turn on the Court's views on physician-\nassisted suicide, but, rather, on the interpretation of the underlying \nstatute. The majority made this clear in the first paragraph. Justice \nKennedy explained:\n\n       The dispute before us is in part a product of this \n     political and moral debate, but its resolution requires an \n     inquiry familiar to the courts: interpreting a federal \n     statute to determine whether Executive action is authorized \n     by, or otherwise consistent with, the enactment.\n\n  The Supreme Court had not ruled on the wisdom or appropriateness or \nconstitutionality of physician-assisted suicide, but the Senator was \ncritical of Chief Justice Roberts because he had not voted to uphold \nassisted suicide, and the Senator didn't think Sam Alito would either. \nOne could fervently agree with the Senator on the policy issue, yet \ninterpret the statute in a way that requires a different result. But, \nit appears, results are all that matter.\n  As another example from yesterday's committee meeting, a Senator said \nthat protecting wetlands was very important, and wanted to make sure \nthat Judge Alito would allow the Federal Government to protect them \nunder the Clean Water Act. The Senator acknowledged that the underlying \nconstitutional question was the extent of Congress's power to regulate \nnon-navigable waterways which, arguably, are not in interstate \ncommerce. That is a thorny constitutional question. But, rather than \nacknowledging that Congress might have gone too far in exercising its \npower to regulate interstate commerce, the Senator was troubled that \nJudge Alito's future votes on protecting wetlands could not be \npredicted.\n\n  Now, I don't mean to single out any one Senator, because the same \nthing happened throughout the committee meeting. Senator after Senator \nwould bring up the results of decisions by Judge Alito without any \nregard as to why he reached a certain result, such as their procedural \ndisposition, the proper standard of review, the governing case law of \nthe Supreme Court or the Third Circuit, or the legal reasoning that \nJudge Alito used. It was all about results.\n  As a final example, another Senator wanted Judge Alito to tell him \nthat it was unconstitutional for the President to take major military \naction against Iran or Syria absent prior congressional authorization. \nHe was exasperated that Judge Alito wouldn't just prejudge the \nquestion, which the Senator called ``basic,'' and say that the \nPresident could not do so. But Judge Alito gave the judge's answer. It \nwas anything but ``basic.'' Judge Alito explained that he needed to \nconsider the political question doctrine first, then to analyze the \nscope of the President's Article II War Powers, the history of the use \nof force absent congressional authorization--it's a very complicated \nhistory--and then apply it to the facts before him. The Senator wanted \na politician's answer, a policymaker's answer. In other words, he \nwanted to know how that case would turn out, before it was briefed and \nargued. But all we should be asking, is how he would approach the \nquestion. What principles would Sam Alito apply, not what kind of \nresults Sam Alito will deliver.\n  Abortion, executive power in a time of war, congressional power, \nState sovereign immunity, the 4th amendment,\n\n[[Page S98]]\n\nwetlands regulation, the death penalty--many Senators have constructed \na confirmation standard that revolves completely around predictions \nabout how cases related to issues such as these will come out. We \ncannot allow our public policy aspirations to cloud our view of the \njudicial function.\n  If our process evolves into results-oriented voting, votes will \ninevitably become partisan. Indeed, it appears that it has already \nbecome partisan. The confirmations of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen \nBreyer speak volumes about how this results-oriented approach is, in \nfact, a problem centered within the democratic caucus. Both of these \nnominees had a long history of liberalism. Both were Democrats with \nties to the political left. Ginsburg was the former general counsel to \nthe ACLU who had advocated taxpayer funding of abortion, and Breyer had \nbeen Senator Kennedy's chief counsel and an academic promoter of an \nexpansive regulatory state. Yet both received unanimous support from \nthe Judiciary Committee. Justice Ginsburg received 96 votes on the \nfloor, and Justice Breyer received 87 votes. They have served for more \nthan a decade on the left side of the Supreme Court, exactly as \nRepublicans suspected that they would when they voted to confirm them. \nBut Republicans evaluated their judicial qualifications favorably, \ntrusted their commitments to approach cases with an open mind, and gave \ndeference to the President's choice. After all, he had won the \nelection.\n  We haven fallen a long way since Justice Breyer was confirmed in \n1994. The Republicans who put aside their policy goals and supported \nliberal Democratic nominees have been rewarded with unprecedented \nfilibusters of qualified nominees to the lower courts and the adoption \nof a results-oriented confirmation standard for the Supreme Court.\n  I say to my Democrat colleagues--is this really the path you want to \nput us on? You have already dramatically increased the chance of future \nfilibusters. Do we really want Senators to vote against any nominee who \nwill not prejudge cases and guarantee results? I know that the most \nideological activists on both sides of the spectrum would prefer that \npath, but do you? Does the Senate? Does the Nation?\n\n  As I said, for now this is a Democrat problem. But it is naive to \nthink that, someday, Republicans won't decide that what is good for the \ngoose is good for the gander. And while your ``no'' votes on Judge \nAlito will not keep him from the Supreme Court, I say to my Democratic \nfriends--what if President Bush had lost the 2004 election but there \nwere 55 Republicans in the Senate? If Republicans today were applying \nyour results-oriented, litmus-test-based standard to a Democrat \nPresident's nominees, would it be possible to confirm anybody even \nvaguely as liberal as Ginsburg or Breyer. If we followed your path, the \nanswer would clearly be ``no.'' This is a terribly dangerous road to \ntravel.\n  We all know that the Supreme Court confirmation process has taken on \npolitical campaign-like elements, with television advertisements and \ngrass roots activism. That development, plus this results-oriented \napproach to confirmation, represents the subtle rejection of the very \nidea of a non-political, independent judiciary. What else can we \nconclude when Senators won't vote for a nominee who even they say is \nqualified and has high integrity, just because they want to guarantee \ncertain results out of the Court? That's not law. That's politics. It \nis the antithesis of the rule of law and constitutional government. Do \nwe really just want policy makers in robes? I remember when President \nClinton's former White House Counsel, Lloyd Cutler, testified before \nthe Judiciary Committee. His answer was a resounding ``No.''\n  In conclusion, I remind the Senate of something Justice O'Connor said \nlast September: the rule of law is ``hard to create and easier than \nmost people imagine to destroy.'' That warning speaks directly to what \nwe face today. If a partisan block of Senators continue down this path \nof politicization, it cannot be expected to apply to only one party. \nThe ultimate loser will not be Republicans or Democrats, but the rule \nof law itself.\n  ``Hard to create, and easier than most people imagine to destroy.'' \nMy friends, please--take a step back. The man is qualified. He has high \nintegrity. He is fair. He deserves your vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination \nof Judge Samuel Alito, Jr., to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  One of the greatest honors and responsibilities of a Senator is a \nvote we cast to confirm judges. Our role is not one that I take \nlightly. It is with deep respect for the laws of this Nation and for \nthe highest Court in our land that I stand before the Senate today.\n  As Senators, we are tasked with the specific duty in the checks and \nbalances system of our Government. It is with our advice and consent \nthat a President's nominee is confirmed or rejected. This is how it has \nworked since the Constitution was adopted. Our forefathers, with great \nbrilliance and foresight, wanted to ensure that no one person wielded \nexcessive power. However, at the same time, it is the President who \nselects a nominee. He earns that power as the elected leader of the \nUnited States. President Bush nominated Judge Alito. We are here to \nconsider that nomination.\n  I had the opportunity to meet Judge Alito and I find he is extremely \nqualified to join the highest Court in this land. His experience, his \ntemperament, his understanding of the role of the Court and his respect \nfor the law make him an admirable candidate who I believe will serve \nthis Nation well.\n  The single most important factor that went into my decision of \nwhether to support Judge Alito has to do with the Justices' role on the \nCourt. The job of the judiciary is to apply and interpret the \nConstitution and the laws of the land. Unfortunately, not everyone sees \nit that way. That is why judicial activism has become so rampant in \nthis country. In no way is it the judiciary's purview to make laws. \nThat is clearly the job of legislators. Legislators are to make the \nlaws and judges apply them. Judge Alito understands this principle and \nhas demonstrated so throughout his esteemed career.\n  In his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee he spoke about \nthe limited role of the judiciary. Judge Alito stated it should always \nbe asking itself whether it has strayed over the bounds, whether it is \ninvading the authority of the legislature, for example, whether it is \nmaking policy judgments rather than interpreting the law. That has to \nbe a constant process of reexamination of the judges.\n  During Judge Alito's confirmation hearing, Democrats tried to make \nthe case that judicial precedent is more important than the \nConstitution itself. Most Americans believe the words of the \nConstitution should have real meaning. A strict constructionist \napproach to interpreting the Constitution is necessary for the \nconsistent application of our laws. How can we as the legislative \nbranch do our jobs effectively when the judicial branch is free to \nprovide an expansive reading of the Constitution at any moment? I don't \nbelieve we can.\n  For this reason, we need judges who value the Constitution first. \nPrecedent is a necessary tool to ensure consistent application of the \nlaws, but precedent should not be held so high that we prohibit judges \nfrom revisiting bad precedent. The history of the Supreme Court \nsupports this idea. If bad precedent could not be overturned, Plessy v. \nFerguson would still stand and racial segregation would still be legal \nin this country. That thought is truly reprehensible. The Supreme \nCourt, in fact, has overturned its own precedent at least 225 times. \nThat is nearly once per year.\n  I support Judge Alito's nomination because his testimony demonstrates \nhis understanding of the principle that the Constitution, and not \nprecedent, is preeminent.\n  In addition to his clear and committed approach to interpreting laws \nand not being a judicial activist, I think the testimony and support of \nhis colleagues speaks volumes about what we can expect from Justice \nAlito.\n  Judge Maryanne Trump Barry has served on the Third Circuit with Judge \nAlito since President Bill Clinton appointed her in 1999. She also \nworked in the U.S. Attorney's Office with Judge Alito in the late \n1970s. About his service as U.S. attorney, she stated:\n\n       Samuel Alito set a standard of excellence that was \n     contagious--his commitment to\n\n[[Page S99]]\n\n     doing the right thing, never playing fast and loose with the \n     record, never taking a shortcut, his emphasis on first-rate \n     work, his fundamental decency.\n\n  Judge Aldisert of the Third Circuit, appointed by President Johnson, \nhas worked with Judge Alito for 15 years. He testified about the \nexperience of those who have served with Judge Alito. Because of Judge \nAlito's work on the bench, he stated:\n\n       . . . we who are his colleagues are convinced that he will \n     also be a great justice.\n\n  The character, the qualifications, and the commitment of Judge Alito \nare not in question by anybody in this room. His long history of public \nservice has proven that. He has served our judicial system and our \nNation with the utmost honor, and we can expect him to continue that \nlegacy from our Supreme Court.\n  I urge all of my colleagues in the Senate to consider their vote and \nto avoid partisanship. Consider Judge Alito's qualifications. Consider \nhis respect for the Constitution. Senator Kyl from Arizona preceded me \non the floor. He talked about the dangerous precedent that would be set \nif this body were to depart from the standard of judging nominees based \non their experience in favor of a partisan approach. Republicans, back \nin the 1990s, voted for two people they knew would be liberal. The \nbasis on which Judge Alito's confirmation is based will likely \ndetermine the basis by which all future nominees will be judged.\n  What I think is important to consider is not how someone will rule \nbut rather on their judicial approach with respect to the words of the \nConstitution, at the writing of the Founders, at the principles on \nwhich America was founded. That is the judicial approach I want \nsomebody to have on the Highest Court in the land. And that is the \njudicial approach I believe--no one knows for sure, but I believe--\nSamuel Alito has and how he will make judgments as an Associate Justice \nof the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  So I urge all my colleagues to support his nomination. Mr. President, \nI yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I have come to the Senate floor to \ndiscuss the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito. My purpose is to share \nwith my colleagues and the people of Minnesota my decision to vote to \nconfirm Judge Alito and the reasons for it.\n  This is one of the most solemn and important events in the life of \nthe Senate. From Minnesota, I watched and listened to the hearings \nclosely. Judge Alito's intellect and character are nothing short of \nremarkable.\n  On day four of the hearings, January 12, 2006, four sitting and two \nformer judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit \ntestified on behalf of Judge Sam Alito's nomination to the Supreme \nCourt. They spoke about his independence, judgment, intellect, and \ncharacter.\n  I remember listening to Judge Timothy Lewis tell us that Judge Alito \nwill be the type of Justice who will listen with an open mind and will \nnot have any agenda-driven or result-oriented approach. I think that is \nwhat we want in a judge.\n  What is interesting is that Judge Lewis is a Clinton appointee. He \nstated:\n\n       I am openly and unapologetically pro-choice and always have \n     been.\n\n  Judge Lewis went on to state:\n\n       I am openly--and it's very well known--a committed human \n     rights and civil rights activist and am actively engaged in \n     that process as my time permits. . . .\n       I am very, very much involved in a number of endeavors that \n     one who is familiar with Judge Alito's background and \n     experience may wonder--``Well, why are you here today saying \n     positive things about his prospects as a justice on the \n     Supreme Court?''\n       And the reason is that having worked with him, I came to \n     respect what I think are the most important qualities for \n     anyone who puts on a robe, no matter what court they will \n     serve on, but in particular, the United States Supreme Court.\n\n  It has been said that the most important decision in Government is \n``who decides?'' With magnificent simplicity, article II, section 2 of \nthe Constitution lays out the process for placing members on our \nHighest Court. It says:\n\n       . . . he [the President] shall nominate, and by and with \n     the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint \n     [justices] of the Supreme Court. . . .\n\n  For us, elected officials, the process of determining who will lead \nis long, drawn out, expensive, and sometimes very noisy. But for the \nselection of Justices, the Founders wanted the process to reflect the \ndignity of the office.\n  Unfortunately, we have witnessed a deterioration of the dignity and \nsolemnity of that process in the last few years. Despite Chairman \nSpecter's best efforts, the hearing before the Judiciary Committee \nseemed, at times, to me, at least in some ways, an exercise in \nfutility.\n  I would like to know the breakdown between the amount of time \nSenators on the committee spent making speeches for the witness to hear \nand how much time they spent listening to him. The ``advice and \nconsent'' process became ``lobby and confront.''\n  The Senate should examine the nominee, not dissect him or her.\n  I have read he was asked more than 700 questions. The Presiding \nOfficer should know; he was there. He sat through part of that \nprocess. I believe he brought, and others try to bring, a sense of \nasking the nominee about the process that he would employ in making \ndecisions. It was clear that what Judge Alito brought to the table was \nnot one that says here is what I believe and as a result this is what I \nwill do but, rather, what you would want a judge to do: What do the \nfacts say, what does the law say, what does the Constitution say.\n\n  In being asked 700 questions, I think that is something like 500 more \nthan Justice Ginsburg was asked. Senators on the committee who had \npreviously counseled nominees not to answer specific questions on \nissues that will come before them on the Court on this occasion abused \nthe nominee for not doing so. The American people know what this \nprocess is supposed to be about. The President nominates and the Senate \nconfirms. The President, who was elected by all the people, did his \njob. Now it is time for us to do ours.\n  When we approach issues of greatest magnitude, the Senate should be \nat its very best. I like Stephen Covey's advice to leaders when he \nwrote:\n\n       The Main Thing is to keep the Main Thing the Main Thing.\n\n  Despite all the distractions and attempted detours, there is a main \nthing to be focused on. This main thing is not a particular issue or \npolitical agenda. This main thing should not vary based on whether your \nparty is in the White House. I hope that in my time in the Senate, if \nthere is a President of a different party, I will bring the same \napproach that I have tried to bring to the judges that President Bush \nhas nominated. My consistent standard throughout my time in the Senate \nwill be this: Is the nominee qualified by relevant experience, proper \njudicial temperament, and ethical standards which are beyond reproach? \nDoes he bring a perspective that says a judge is to be a judge or \nreferee, not to bring his or her personal opinions to the table to \ncreate law as he or she sees it but, rather, does what Judge Alito \ndoes, looks at the facts, looks at the law, the Constitution.\n  I would submit that a quick search for the votes and record of \njudicial nominations over the last 200 years would indicate this is the \nhistorical standard almost all Senators have taken. The current \ncircumstance of microscopic examination, politicizing, and threats of \nfilibusters is a major historical aberration. For the sake of the \njudiciary and the whole constitutional system, I hope we find our way \nback to the way things have been for over the last 200 years plus, \nrather than the last 5 years.\n  In my view, Judge Samuel Alito is extremely well qualified to serve \non the Supreme Court. He has an extraordinary legal mind. There is no \ndoubt about it. He has demonstrated in his years on the bench and in \nhundreds of cases that he views the judicial role as following the \nConstitution and interpreting the law, not making the law.\n  Judge Alito told us in his own words that ``no person in this \ncountry, no matter how high or powerful, is above the law, and no \nperson in this country\n\n[[Page S100]]\n\nis beneath the law.'' He also told us that ``our Constitution applies \nin times of peace and in times of war, and it protects the rights of \nAmericans under all circumstances.''\n  On results-oriented jurisprudence, Judge Alito stated:\n\n       Results-oriented jurisprudence is never justified because \n     it is not our job to try to produce particular results. We \n     are not policymakers. We shouldn't be implementing any sort \n     of policy agenda or policy preferences we have.\n\n  In effect, this was the same standard that Judge Roberts applied. I \nrecall he was asked a question whether he was ruling on behalf of the \nlittle guy. And the comment was, if the Constitution says the little \nguy deserves to win, he will. And if it says that he doesn't deserve to \nwin, then he won't. That is what judges should do. That is the way they \nshould operate.\n  Advice and consent was never intended as a rehash of the previous \nPresidential election. It was never intended as a means for the Senate \nto impose its policy agenda on a future court. I worry that we are \nwalking down a dangerous path when Senators start looking at judges and \nin effect requiring them to say, yes, I will rule a certain way or \notherwise you will not get my vote.\n  Advice and consent was never intended as a means to grandstand or \nplacate interest groups. I will proudly vote to support Judge Alito's \nnomination. His career, his writings, and his class during this less-\nthan-ideal confirmation process are proof that he will be an \noutstanding member of the highest Court. The President has done his job \nadmirably. He has nominated an outstanding judge. The Senate has \nexamined his qualifications. Now it is time for us to do our job and \nconfirm Samuel Alito as an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, pending before the U.S. Senate is the \nnomination of Judge Sam Alito from the Third Circuit to the U.S. \nSupreme Court. As I mentioned earlier in the day, it is a historic \nmoment seldom seen on the floor of the Senate when we discuss the \npossible elevation of an individual to a lifetime appointment to the \nhighest Court in the land.\n  The Supreme Court is the last refuge for America's rights and \nfreedoms. It is an important institution for our values and our future. \nThat is why during the course of the day many Members of the Senate \nhave come to the floor to express their feelings about Judge Alito. It \nis largely broken down on partisan lines. Those on the other side of \nthe aisle--the Republican side--are virtually all in support of Judge \nAlito. Most on the Democratic side oppose him.\n  I have listened to what many of the Republican Senators who have come \nto the floor have said. Almost every Republican Senator who has come to \nthe floor today has made the argument that we should all vote for Judge \nAlito because in 1993, some 13 years ago, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, \na Supreme Court nominee of President Clinton, was confirmed \noverwhelmingly by the Senate. That appears to be talking point No. 1 \nthat the White House generated not only in conversation today on the \nfloor, but also at the hearing concluded recently in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. There are some fundamental flaws in their \nreasoning and I will point out three:\n  First, as I mentioned this morning, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, \nwhose vacancy is being filled, has been the fifth and decisive vote on \nmany issues central to our democracy. The Justice who takes her place \nis truly in the position to tip the scales of justice in America. In \nthe last 10 years, 193 cases have been decided in the Supreme Court by \nthe closest of votes, 5 to 4; and of the 193 cases, Justice Sandra Day \nO'Connor has been the deciding vote in 148; 77 percent of these closely \ndivided decisions were decided by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Now, the \nJustice whom Ruth Bader Ginsburg replaced in 1993, Byron White, didn't \nplay the same pivotal role Justice O'Connor has played as the decisive \nvote on so many important issues.\n  Second, President Clinton selected Justice Ginsburg after a real, \nauthentic consultation with Republicans in the Senate. This morning, I \nsaw Senator Hatch early in the day and I said his book sales must be up \nbecause everybody is quoting him. It is a book he wrote entitled \n``Square Peg: Confessions of a Citizen Senator.'' In that book, Senator \nOrrin Hatch of Utah described how in 1993, as the top Republican on the \nJudiciary Committee, he received a telephone call from President \nClinton to discuss possible Supreme Court nominees. Senator Hatch \nrecounted in his book--and still stands by it--that he warned President \nClinton away from a nominee whose confirmation Senator Hatch believed \n``would not be easy,'' in his words. He wrote in his book that he \nsuggested the names of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whom President Clinton had \nnever heard of, according to Senator Hatch, and Stephen Breyer. Senator \nHatch wrote that he assured President Clinton that Ginsburg and Breyer \n``would be confirmed easily.''\n  What a contrast to the situation we face today. President Bush sends \nthe names of nominees to the Senate without previous consultation. In \nfact, I may be mistaken on this particular nominee, Judge Alito, but I \ndo recall Senator Specter saying he learned of Harriet Miers' \nnomination when the news media announced it--or only shortly before. I \nthink he said he was called within an hour or so before the news \nannouncement. That is much different than the consultation that took \nplace with Senator Hatch and President Clinton, where President Clinton \nwent to the ranking Republican--not even the Chair at that moment--and \nasked him for advice and consultation on the next Supreme Court \nnomination.\n  Judge Alito was nominated not as a product of bipartisan consultation \nwith the Senate but, rather, as a payoff--or at least a satisfaction to \nthe radical right who had turned their back on Harriet Miers' \nnomination.\n  There is another crucial difference between Judge Alito and Judge \nGinsburg. Despite some Republican Senators' efforts to rewrite history, \nJudge Ginsburg was viewed at the time of her nomination as a moderate \nand centrist judge based on her dozen years of service on the Federal \nbench. In a National Public Radio news story dated June 18, 1993, a \nreporter named Nina Totenberg said as follows:\n\n       Why did the Republicans feel so comfortable with Judge \n     Ginsburg? The answer is that her judicial record shows her to \n     be the most conservative Carter-appointed judge on the U.S. \n     Court of Appeals here in the District of Columbia.\n\n  She's considered a centrist, a swing vote. And in fact, a statistical \nanalysis done in 1987 of that Court's voting pattern shows Judge \nGinsburg voting substantially more often with the court's conservative \nRepublican bloc of judges, led by then-Judge Robert Bork, than with the \nliberal Democrat judges.\n  Judge Alito, by contrast, has never been called a centrist judge. At \nleast those who looked at his record have not called him that. He is \nnot a judge who votes more often with his Democratic colleagues than \nhis Republican colleagues. Far from it. Judge Alito is a staunch \nconservative and the most frequent dissenter on his court. When he \ndissents, it is almost always in a rightward and more conservative \ndirection.\n  I spoke earlier about Judge Alito's track record on civil rights. I \ntalked about some of the cases in which he showed a particular \ninsensitivity to those who came before his court without the trappings \nof power. In fact, Judge Alito, in many of those cases, was the sole \ndissenting judge. Because Justice O'Connor was the fifth and deciding \nvote on so many cases involving civil rights and racial justice, Judge \nAlito will tip the scales of justice on those issues if he is \nconfirmed.\n  At this point, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter of January 6, 2006, from the Leadership Conference on Civil \nRights that has been submitted in opposition to the nomination of Judge \nAlito, signed by Dr. Dorothy Height, chairperson, and Wade Henderson, \nexecutive director.\n\n[[Page S101]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                             Leadership Conference\n\n\n                                              on Civil Rights,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 6, 2006.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter, Chairman,\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy, Ranking Member,\n     Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Specter and Ranking Member Leahy: On behalf \n     of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights (LCCR), the \n     nation's oldest, largest, and most diverse civil and human \n     rights coalition, we write to express our opposition to the \n     confirmation of Judge Samuel A. Alito, Jr. as Associate \n     Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. The \n     Supreme Court's jurisprudence over the past 50 years has \n     often served to protect the fundamental constitutional rights \n     of all Americans. Judge Alito's decisions, however, often \n     stand in direct contrast to that jurisprudence and embrace a \n     much more limited and narrow view of constitutional rights \n     and civil rights guarantees. A careful examination of Judge \n     Alito's record reveals a history of troubling decisions in \n     the areas of civil rights, civil liberties, and fundamental \n     freedoms, decisions that undermine the power of the \n     Constitution and of Congress to, protect the civil and human \n     rights of all Americans. LCCR believes that Judge Alito's \n     record does not demonstrate an adequate commitment to \n     protecting fundamental rights and, therefore, urges the \n     Senate to reject his nomination.\n       The Supreme Court is the final arbiter of our laws, and its \n     rulings can drastically impact the lives, liberties, and \n     rights of all Americans. As such, LCCR believes that no \n     individual should be confirmed to the Supreme Court unless he \n     or she has clearly shown a strong commitment to the \n     protection of civil rights and liberties, human rights, \n     privacy, and religious freedom. The evidence reviewed to date \n     shows that Judge Alito's record in these areas is highly \n     troubling. His overall record reveals a jurist whose views \n     are clearly to the right of where most Americans stand on a \n     number of issues, including the reach of civil rights laws, \n     the constitutional safeguards afforded those within our \n     criminal justice system, and the power of Congress to protect \n     Americans in the workplace and elsewhere.\n       In addition, LCCR is very troubled by the statements Judge \n     Alito made in his 1985 application to be the Reagan \n     administration's Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the \n     Office of Legal Counsel. In particular, Judge Alito cited his \n     disagreement with key rulings by the Supreme Court on \n     legislative reapportionment, criminal justice and religious \n     liberties, and added that he was ``particularly proud'' of \n     his work to restrict affirmative action and limit remedies in \n     racial discrimination cases. Although he now claims that \n     these were just mere words on an application, his record as a \n     jurist reveals something different. The ideological views \n     taken in the application and during his time in the Reagan \n     administration are exemplified throughout his judicial \n     decision making, where he routinely favors a reading of \n     statutory and constitutional law that limits the rights of \n     individuals and the power of Congress to protect those \n     individuals. The following is a summary of the reasons for \n     LCCR's opposition:\n\n\n     Judge Alito's ``Disagreement'' with Supreme Court Rulings on \n                            Reapportionment\n\n       In an essay attached to a 1985 application for a position \n     within the Department of Justice, Judge Alito wrote that he \n     had been motivated by his opposition to, among other things, \n     the Warren Court's rulings on legislative reapportionment. \n     Because those rulings first articulated the fundamental civil \n     rights principle of ``one person, one vote,'' and paved the \n     way for major strides in the effort to secure equal voting \n     rights for all Americans, his stated opposition to them is \n     extremely troubling. It is vital to understand the context in \n     which these cases were decided.\n       Prior to the 1960s, as urban areas throughout the country \n     experienced rapid population growth, many state and federal \n     legislative districts were not redrawn, often leaving rural \n     voters with far more representation per capita--and thus far \n     more political power--than urban residents. In Florida, for \n     example, just 12 percent of the population could elect a \n     majority of the state senate. While unequal districts \n     affected all voters, their impact was especially harsh in the \n     South, where, along with discriminatory requirements like \n     poll taxes and literacy tests, malapportionment virtually \n     guaranteed the exclusion of racial minorities from the \n     democratic process. Until 1962, the federal courts generally \n     refused to intervene, dismissing such matters as ``political \n     questions.''\n       The Supreme Court's ruling in Baker v. Carr broke new \n     ground when the Court declared, for the first time, that the \n     federal courts had a role to play in making sure that all \n     Americans have a constitutional right to equal \n     representation. In Wesberry v. Sanders, the Court examined \n     Congressional districts in the State of Georgia, which had \n     drawn its legislative map so that 823,680 people in the \n     Atlanta are were all represented by one Congressman, while a \n     rural Congressman represented only 272,154 people. The Court \n     held that these disparities violated the Equal Protection \n     Clause of the 14th Amendment, and ordered that the districts \n     be redrawn more evenly. In Reynolds v. Sims, the Court \n     applied the principle of ``one person, one vote'' to state \n     legislatures, which, in many cases, had even more drastic \n     malapportionment than Congressional districts. For example, \n     the Reynolds case itself challenged Alabama's legislative \n     districts, in which one county with more than 600,000 people \n     had only one senator, while another county with only 15,417 \n     people also had its own senator.\n       In articulating the concept of ``one person, one vote,'' \n     the so-called ``Reapportionment Revolution'' cases equalized \n     political power between urban and rural voters, and ensured \n     that every citizen would have an equal voice in the \n     legislative process. Along with the passage of the Voting \n     Rights Act of 1965 and its subsequent amendments, the \n     decisions also paved the way to far greater representation of \n     racial and ethnic minorities, at both the state and federal \n     levels of government. They also helped open the door for \n     legal challenges to the ``at-large'' and ``multi- \n     member'' districts that many Southern states established \n     in an effort to circumvent the Baker rulings and continue \n     excluding African-American voters from the political \n     process.\n       The Warren Court decisions that established the \n     constitutional principle of ``one person, one vote'' were a \n     catalyst for tremendous progress in our nation's efforts to \n     secure equal voting rights for all Americans, and quickly \n     became so accepted as a matter of constitutional law that \n     they could fairly be described as ``superprecedent.'' Yet two \n     decades later, long after most of the nation had come to \n     embrace this progress, Judge Alito still boasted of his \n     opposition to it. The fact that he would use his opposition \n     as a ``selling tactic'' for a job in 1985 is disconcerting, \n     and raises suspicions about his overall legal philosophy that \n     deserve extensive scrutiny.\n\n\n Judge Alito's Narrow Reading of Anti-Discrimination and Other Worker \n                            Protection Laws\n\n       Judge Alito's record also raises concerns about whether he \n     would be a strong enforcer of our nation's civil rights and \n     labor laws. His decisions thus far in such cases show a \n     pattern of narrow interpretations of the laws, placing \n     greater burdens on civil rights plaintiffs to prove \n     discrimination and making it harder for the government to \n     protect workers.\n       In a number of cases involving race, gender, disability, \n     and age discrimination, Judge Alito was clearly to the right \n     of his colleagues on the Third Circuit. In Bray v. Mariott \n     Hotels, for example, the Third Circuit ruled that an African-\n     American plaintiff who had been denied a promotion had shown \n     that racial discrimination might have been a factor, and that \n     she was therefore entitled to take her case to trial. But \n     Judge Alito dissented, writing an opinion that prompted the \n     majority to charge that ``Title VII would be eviscerated if \n     our analysis were to halt where the dissent suggests.'' In \n     Sheridan v. E.I DuPont de Nemours and Co., a gender \n     discrimination plaintiff sued after being denied a promotion. \n     A jury ruled in her favor, but the trial judge threw out the \n     verdict. The Third Circuit found that she had presented \n     enough evidence to persuade the jury that discrimination was \n     a factor, but Judge Alito was the lone dissenter in the en \n     banc decision. Judge Alito acknowledged that additional \n     evidence of discrimination, beyond proof that an employer's \n     explanation for an adverse decision was pretextual, should \n     not usually be required for a plaintiff to get to a jury, but \n     he maintained that summary judgment might still be \n     appropriate in some cases. The result Judge Alito would have \n     reached in the Sheridan case, however--reversing a jury \n     finding of sex discrimination that every other judge on the \n     Third Circuit would have upheld--undermines the neutral \n     standard he articulated. To reach this result, Judge Alito \n     not only gave the employer the benefit of the doubt but \n     failed to consider some of the most important evidence \n     brought by Sheridan. Finally, in Nathanson v. Medical College \n     of Pennsylvania, a prospective medical student filed suit \n     under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, claiming that the \n     school failed to provide accommodations for a back injury. \n     The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the \n     school, but a Third Circuit panel reversed on the \n     Rehabilitation Act claim because there were different factual \n     assertions that necessitated a jury trial. Judge Alito \n     dissented, prompting his colleagues to write that under his \n     standards, ``few if any Rehabilitation Act cases would \n     survive summary judgment.\n       Judge Alito's record on anti-discrimination cases becomes \n     more troubling when considered in light of his record prior \n     to serving on the Third Circuit. As Assistant to the \n     Solicitor General during the Reagan administration, Judge \n     Alito co-authored several amicus curiae briefs that sought to \n     eliminate affirmative action policies that were put in place \n     to remedy past discrimination, discrimination which, in one \n     case, persisted in contravention of at least three court \n     orders over an eight-year period. In his 1985 application for \n     a promotion within the Justice Department, Judge Alito later \n     mischaracterized these cases as involving nothing more than \n     challenges to ``racial and ethnic quotas.'' Judge Alito's \n     involvement in the Reagan Justice Department's zealous \n     campaign to undermine affirmative action remedies suggests \n     that he adheres to an ideology that goes beyond mere \n     conservatism on civil rights matters.\n       In cases involving other worker protections that deal with \n     such matters as salary,\n\n[[Page S102]]\n\n     pensions and job safety, Judge Alito has also demonstrated a \n     clear and unmistakable tendency to rule narrowly and against \n     working people. Given a choice between reading a statute \n     broadly, consistent with Congress' intent to provide workers \n     with basic protections, or reading a statute in the narrowest \n     way possible, he again shows a disturbing tendency to come \n     down against workers. In Reich v. Gateway Press, for example, \n     Judge Alito dissented from a ruling in which the Third \n     Circuit found that employees of a group of related community \n     newspapers were protected by the overtime rules of the Fair \n     Labor Standards Act. The majority reasoned that while the law \n     may not have covered each individual newspaper, which were \n     small in size and circulation, the papers and all employment \n     decisions were managed by one company and thus amounted to an \n     ``enterprise'' that was subject to the overtime law. Judge \n     Alito dissented, however, and would have denied this \n     coverage, claiming that neither the statute nor the \n     legislative history could support the majority's conclusion. \n     In Belcufine v. Aloe, on the other hand, Judge Alito took a \n     more expansive reading of the law, but in this case it was in \n     order to benefit corporate officers at the expense of \n     workers. Belcufine involved a state law that held corporate \n     officers personally liable for unpaid wages and benefits. \n     Judge Alito ruled, in a split decision, that the law could no \n     longer be applicable, as a matter of policy, once a \n     corporation has filed a bankruptcy petition. The dissenting \n     opinion pointed out that nothing in the statute in question \n     ``even remotely can be read to excuse the agents and \n     officers'' from liability once a company files for \n     bankruptcy.\n\n\n   Judge Alito's Willingness to Undercut Fundamental Privacy and Due \n                             Process Rights\n\n       In cases involving criminal justice matters such as the \n     Fourth Amendment, habeas corpus, and the right to effective \n     assistance of counsel, Judge Alito has shown an excessive \n     tendency to defer to police and prosecutors. This deference \n     frequently comes at the expense of the constitutional rights \n     and civil liberties of individual Americans, and it raises \n     concerns about whether Judge Alito would help enable \n     governmental abuses of power.\n       In Doe v. Groody, Judge Alito argued in dissent that police \n     officers who conducted strip searches without a warrant could \n     still be entitled to qualified immunity. The majority \n     concluded, in a decision authored by Judge Chertoff, that \n     strip searches of the suspect's wife and ten-year-old \n     daughter went well beyond the police's warrant to search the \n     home of a suspected drug dealer, and that the officers were \n     therefore not entitled to claim qualified immunity as a \n     defense to a subsequent lawsuit. As Judge Chertoff noted, \n     holding otherwise would ``transform the judicial officer into \n     little more than the cliche `rubber stamp.' '' Judge Alito, \n     in criticizing the majority for what he called a ``technical \n     and legalistic'' ruling in favor of the plaintiffs, would \n     have granted authority to the police to decide who could be \n     searched and therefore, would have given the officers \n     immunity for invading the privacy rights of the wife and \n     daughter. In United States v. Lee, Judge Alito upheld the \n     warrantless video surveillance by the FBI of a suspect's \n     hotel suite. He justified his ruling on the ground that the \n     FBI only turned on the surveillance equipment when an \n     informant was present in the suite and could ``consent'' to \n     the surveillance, but this ruling disregarded the fact that \n     the equipment was capable of being used at any time and thus \n     enabled the FBI to invade the suspect's privacy at any time. \n     And in Baker v. Monroe Township, a woman and her children \n     were searched as they were entering premises that were the \n     subject of a search wacrant. The search warrant specified a \n     location but there were no names included on the warrant, \n     which led the majority to conclude that the warrant was \n     deficient under the requirements of the Fourth Amendment. \n     Judge Alito dissented, however, arguing that the lack of \n     particularity in the warrant allowed the officers more leeway \n     to search anyone on the premises.\n       Judge Alito's overly deferential attitude toward law \n     enforcement at the expense of privacy rights was also evident \n     before his appointment to the Third Circuit. In a 1984 \n     memorandum, Judge Alito--then an attorney with the Justice \n     Department--opined that the Attorney General and other \n     government officials should have absolute immunity from civil \n     liability for wiretapping the phones of Americans without a \n     warrant. He urged the administration not to pursue such an \n     argument in a pending Supreme Court case, but only on purely \n     strategic grounds. The Supreme Court, in Mitchell v. Forsyth, \n     went on to rule that absolute immunity did not apply in such \n     situations, rejecting the broad, troubling view expressed in \n     Judge Alito's memorandum.\n       Judge Alito's record is equally troubling in other areas of \n     criminal justice, and shows the same excessive deference to \n     law enforcement that can open the door to abuses. In another \n     1984 memorandum, Judge Alito argued in defense of a state law \n     that had authorized Tennessee police to use deadly force \n     against any fleeing felon suspect whom police have probable \n     cause to believe had committed a violent crime or was armed \n     or dangerous. In the case of Tennessee v. Garner, that law \n     was invoked after police shot and killed an unarmed, 15-year-\n     old, 5'4'' burglary suspect while he was climbing a fence. \n     While Judge Alito did not recommend filing an amicus curiae \n     brief in support of the police in the case, he still found \n     the shooting to be constitutionally defensible. When given a \n     choice between killing a possibly nonviolent suspect and \n     allowing a possibly violent suspect to escape, Judge Alito \n     argued that ``[r]easonable people might choose differently \n     in this situation.'' The Supreme Court disagreed wiih \n     Alito's farfetched analysis, finding ihe statute \n     unconstitutional by a 6-3 margin.\n       Judge Alito's record also reveals a distressing tendency to \n     deny habeas corpus claims of those in the criminal justice \n     system. In Rompilla v. Horn, Judge Alito held that in ihe \n     sentencing phase of a capital murder case, the failure of a \n     defense attorney to investigate and present mitigating \n     evidence, including ihe defendant's traumatic childhood, \n     alcoholism, mental retardation, cognitive impairment and \n     organic brain damage, did not amount to ineffective \n     assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment. \n     His ruling was decried as ``inexplicable'' by the dissent and \n     was overturned by the Supreme Court, which noted that some of \n     the mitigating evidence was publicly available in the very \n     courthouse in which the defendant was tried. Justice O'Connor \n     concurred in reversing Judge Alito's ruling, describing the \n     defense attorney's performance as ``unreasonable.'' In \n     another case, Smith v. Horn, Judge Alito's dissent would have \n     denied ihe habeas claims of a death row inmate. Judge Alito \n     concluded that a jury instruction regarding the defendant's \n     guilt, which the majority found the jury could have \n     reasonable misunderstood, did not amount to a constitutional \n     violation.\n       Finally, the case of Riley v. Taylor shows Judge Alito's \n     reluctance to question prosecutors even where racism is \n     alleged in the jury selection process. In that case, Judge \n     Alito did not find a constitutional violation in the \n     prosecution's apparent use of peremptory challenges to \n     exclude black jurors from a death penalty case involving an \n     African-American defendant. His dissent in the case \n     illustrated a disregard for ihe impact of racially motivated \n     peremptory jury strikes on African-American defendants. The \n     majority had relied, in part, on statistical data to conclude \n     that black jurors had been excluded, but Judge Alito took \n     issue with the use of statistics, questioning the exclusion \n     of black jurors as a statistical oddity and comparing it to \n     the fact that five of the last six U.S. Presidents had been \n     left-handed. His comments drew a sharp rebuke from the \n     majority, who said that ``[t]o suggest any comparability to \n     the striking of jurors based on their race is to minimize the \n     history of discrimination against prospective black jurors \n     and black defendants.\n\n\n           Judge Alito's Troubling Record on Immigration Law\n\n       Judge Alito's record in appeals of asylum and deportation \n     orders reveals an abnormally strong tendency to let adverse \n     Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and lower court rulings \n     stand. For example, an analysis by The Washington Post found \n     that Judge Alito has sided with immigrants in only one out of \n     every eight cases he has handled, which, according to the \n     Post, sets him apart even from most Republican-appointed \n     judges. Judge Alito's record is more problematic in light of \n     the recently growing criticism, by many other federal \n     judges from both parties, of asylum rulings by the BIA and \n     administrative immigration judges.\n       In asylum cases, Judge Alito has a strong tendency to rule \n     against individuals who are seeking protection in the United \n     States, even where evidence shows that they have been or \n     would have been persecuted in their own countries. In Chang \n     v. INS, Judge Alito dissented from the court's grant of \n     asylum for a Chinese engineer who claimed he would face \n     persecution if returned to his own country. Judge Alito found \n     no reason to reverse the INS denial of asylum despite the \n     fact that Chang had presented evidence that his wife and son \n     already faced persecution and he was threatened with jail if \n     he returned to China. Similarly, in Dia v. Ashcroft, Judge \n     Alito dissented from a majority opinion granting asylum to an \n     immigrant from the Republic of Guinea whose house had been \n     burnt down and whose wife had been raped in retaliation for \n     his opposition to the government. The majority noted that the \n     immigration judge seemed to be searching for ways to deny \n     asylum and find fault with the credibility of Dia. Judge \n     Alito's dissent pushed for a higher standard. The majority \n     criticized Judge Alito's dissent, noting that his proposed \n     standard would ``gut the statutory standard'' and ``ignore \n     our precedent.''\n       Judge Alito's excessive tendency to defer to the BIA is \n     also evident from his record in deportation cases. In Lee v. \n     Ashcroft, Judge Alita dissented when the court ruled that a \n     false tax return is not an ``aggravated felony,'' an \n     immigration law term that triggers mandatory deportation and \n     bars most forms of humanitarian waivers. The court reasoned \n     that Congress only intended for tax evasion to trigger \n     mandatory deportation, but Judge Alito disagreed and pushed \n     for a more expansive reading of the law. The majority noted \n     that ambiguity in the law should be resolved in favor of the \n     immigrant and that Judge Alita's interpretation was grounded \n     in ``speculation.'' In Sandoval v. Reno, Judge Alito's \n     dissent would have construed the Antiterrorism and Effective \n     Death Penalty Act of 1996 to strip the federal courts of \n     their ability to hear habeas corpus claims from aliens in \n     custody challenging deportation orders. The Supreme Court \n     ultimately rejected\n\n[[Page S103]]\n\n     Judge Alita's reading of the law, in INS v. St. Cyr, because \n     such an interpretation would raise serious constitutional \n     questions.\n       Also troubling is a 1986 letter Judge Alito wrote, in his \n     capacity as Deputy Assistant Attorney General, to former FBI \n     Director William Webster in which he suggested, inter alia, \n     that ``illegal aliens have no claim to nondiscrimination with \n     respect to nonfundamental rights,'' and that the Constitution \n     ``grants only fundamental rights to illegal aliens within the \n     United States.'' Judge Alito uses a strained reading of the \n     1976 Supreme Court ruling in Mathews v. Diaz to support this \n     assertion, but oddly, he makes no mention of the 1982 ruling \n     in Plyler v. Doe, which squarely ruled that a state could not \n     discriminate against undocumented children in public \n     education, even though education is not considered a \n     fundamental constitutional right. As such, Judge Alito's \n     letter raises questions about whether he would be willing to \n     adequately protect undocumented immigrants from \n     unconstitutional forms of discrimination.\n\n\n       Judge Alito's Restrictive View of the Establishment Clause\n\n       Judge Alito's record shows that he takes an overly narrow \n     view of the First Amendment's Establishment Clause, a view \n     that sets him apart from Justice O'Connor and the majority of \n     her colleagues to serve on the Supreme Court. His record--\n     along with his acknowledged disagreement with the Supreme \n     Court's most noteworthy rulings in this area--raises concerns \n     that he would not do enough to protect the religious \n     liberties of an increasingly diverse America.\n       For example, in ACLU of New Jersey v. Black Horse Pike \n     Regional Board of Education, Judge Alito voted--against an en \n     banc majority of his colleagues on the Third Circuit--to \n     uphold a public school policy that allowed high school \n     seniors to vote on whether to include prayer during a \n     graduation ceremony. By allowing a popular majority of public \n     school students to waive the rights of a minority, Judge \n     Alito's view--had it not also been subsequently rejected by \n     the Supreme Court in a later case--would have essentially \n     defeated the purpose of the Establishment Clause.\n       Judge Alito's ruling in ACLU of New Jersey v. Schundler \n     (Schundler II) is equally troubling. In Schundler, the \n     municipality of Jersey City, New Jersey had placed a creche \n     and menorah outside of City Hall. After a district court \n     ruled that the display violated the Establishment Clause, the \n     city added additional figures to the following year's \n     display, including those of Santa Claus, Frosty the Snowman, \n     a red sled, and Kwanzaa symbols. The district court \n     eventually found that this modified display was also \n     unconstitutional. Judge Alito reversed this decision, \n     however, and upheld the modified display. In doing so, he \n     minimized the fact that the display had only been modified in \n     response to litigation and that the city had been attempting \n     to promote religion through its holiday displays for \n     decades--even though the Supreme Court considers such history \n     to be highly relevant when determining whether a practice or \n     policy violates the Establishment Clause.\n\n\n  Judge Alito's Efforts to Limit Congressional Authority in Favor of \n                           ``States' Rights''\n\n       Judge Alito's record demonstrates a troubling tendency to \n     favor ``states' rights'' over the rights of ordinary \n     Americans. During his tenure on the Third Circuit, he has \n     engaged in an excessively narrow reading of the Commerce \n     Clause and an excessively broad reading of state sovereign \n     immunity under the 11th Amendment. In fact, his decisions \n     show that he would go even further than the current Supreme \n     Court in undercutting Congress' ability to protect Americans.\n       In United States v. Rybar, the Third Circuit upheld the \n     conviction of a firearms dealer for the sale of outlawed \n     machine guns, joining six other circuits in finding the \n     federal law banning the transfer or possession of machine \n     guns to be a valid exercise of Congressional authority under \n     its power to regulate interstate commerce. But Judge Alito \n     dissented, arguing that the Supreme Court's recent decision \n     in United States v. Lopez, which invalidated Congress' gun-\n     free school zone ban, made clear that Congress did not have \n     such power. The majority distinguished Lopez because it dealt \n     with a small geographic area--school zones--whereas the law \n     at issue in Rybar applied nationwide. Judge Alito would have \n     taken Lopez a step beyond to place further restrictions on \n     Congress' power to use its Commerce Clause authority to \n     protect Americans from machine gun violence. Judge Alito's \n     extraordinarily narrow perspective of Congressional power \n     expressed in his Rybar dissent raises serious concerns about \n     whether he will uphold major and historically effective \n     pieces of civil rights infrastructure such as the ban on \n     discrimination in places of employment or public \n     accommodation in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and whether he \n     will hold a restrictive view of Congress' power to move the \n     country forward with additional civil rights laws such as \n     hate crimes and non-discrimination legislation.\n       In Chittister v. Department of Community and Economic \n     Development, Judge Alito's majority opinion would have denied \n     a state employee the benefits of the Family and Medical Leave \n     Act of 1993 (``FMLA''). In this case, a state employee had \n     sued after being fired for taking medical leave that had been \n     approved pursuant to FMLA. A jury ruled in Chittister's \n     favor, but the trial court reversed the verdict on the ground \n     that the state was immune from suit under the 11th Amendment. \n     On appeal, Judge Alito affirmed the ruling, claiming that \n     Congress had not abrogated state sovereign immunity. The \n     Supreme Court later reached an opposite conclusion from Judge \n     Alito's holding in its 2003 decision in Nevada Department of \n     Human Resources v. Hibbs. The Court held that state employees \n     could in fact sue their employers under the FMLA, a decision \n     that has subsequently been read by some courts to validate \n     the constitutionality of the entire law.\n\n\n     judge alito's membership in ``concerned alumni of princeton''\n\n       In the same job application essay described above, Judge \n     Alito also stated that he was ``a member of the Concerned \n     Alumni of Princeton University. a conservative alumni group'' \n     (``CAP''). Throughout its existence, CAP was notorious for \n     its outspoken, inflammatory rhetoric opposing Princeton's \n     decision to enroll female students. Indeed, CAP reportedly \n     advocated limiting the percentage of women admitted to the \n     school. CAP also derided Princeton's efforts to increase the \n     number of minority students; the group argued that children \n     of alumni were more deserving of admission. In the group's \n     magazine, Prospect, one of the organization's founders fondly \n     recalled that Princeton had once been ``a body of men, \n     relatively homogenous in interests and backgrounds,'' but \n     that he now worried about the future of the University ``with \n     an undergraduate student body of approximately 40% women and \n     minorities, such as the Administration has proposed.'' In \n     1975. an alumni panel reviewed admission issues and condemned \n     CAP's characterization of Princeton's policies. The panel, \n     which included current Senate Majority leader Bill Frist, \n     determined that CAP ``presented a distorted, narrow and \n     hostile view of the university that cannot help but have \n     misinformed and even alarmed many alumni.'' It is unclear \n     when Judge Alito joined the group or what role he played in \n     its activities. But his membership in the organization is \n     troubling, given the group's outspoken hostility towards the \n     inclusion of women and minorities at Princeton University, \n     and it raises serious questions about the level of his \n     commitment to gender and racial equality.\n       Also troubling is Judge Alito's current effort, following \n     his nomination to the Supreme Court, to now deny he ever had \n     any affiliation with the group. In a questionnaire he \n     recently submitted to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, \n     Judge Alito stated that ``[a] document I recently reviewed \n     reflects that I was a member of the group [Concerned Alumni \n     of Princeton] in the 1980s. Apart from that document, I have \n     no recollection of being a member, of attending meetings, or \n     otherwise participating in the activities of the group.'' \n     This supposed lack of any recollection of being a member of \n     CAP seems difficult, at best, to reconcile with the statement \n     he made in his 1985 job application essay--a statement in \n     which he not only cited his membership in CAP, but \n     deliberately used this claim of membership in an effort to \n     bolster his conservative credentials.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       The stakes could not be higher. The Supreme Court is \n     closely divided on cases involving many of our most basic \n     rights and freedoms. Judge Alito has been nominated to fill \n     the seat of retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who was the \n     crucial deciding vote in so many of those cases. The American \n     people want and deserve to know that any new Supreme Court \n     justice will be committed to protecting individual rights, \n     and will put our freedoms ahead of any political agenda. \n     Unfortunately, Judge Alito's record not only fails to show \n     such a commitment, but also raises serious doubts.\n       In addition, we also have doubts about whether Judge Alito \n     will, at his confirmation hearings, address the above \n     concerns in a fully open and candid manner. For instance, \n     Judge Alito has given numerous shifting and conflicting \n     reasons for why he did not, as he promised to Senators before \n     being confirmed to the Third Circuit, recuse himself from \n     cases involving the Vanguard companies, in which he had \n     financial holdings. Furthermore, Judge Alito has also \n     recently tried to dismiss a number of troubling statements in \n     his 1985 job application, such as his disagreement with the \n     Warren Court's reapportionment cases, by suggesting that his \n     statements should not be taken seriously because he was \n     simply applying for a job. Finally, as discussed above, Judge \n     Alito has also attempted to deny any affiliation with the \n     radical group Concerned Alumni of Princeton, even though he \n     himself proudly claimed to be a member in 1985. These \n     incidents raise doubts about whether Judge Alito's responses \n     to tough questions about his record and his legal philosophy \n     can be completely believed when his confirmation hearings \n     begin next week.\n       For the above reasons, we must oppose his confirmation as \n     Associate Justice. We appreciate your consideration of our \n     views.

Mr. President, there is another aspect of Judge Alito's \nrecord that is equally troubling, and that is his failure to show that \nhe will protect the average American from the overreaching hand of \ngovernment.\n  I question whether he is dedicated to protecting the privacy rights \nof individuals from government officials in many critical areas of our \nlives. For example, I share the concern of many of my colleagues about \nJudge Alito's decision to allow a police officer to conduct a strip \nsearch of an innocent 10-year-old girl. The police officer, who did not \nhave a valid search warrant in the opinion of a majority of the judges \non Judge Alito's court, took the 10-year-old girl and her mother into a \nbathroom, ordered them to empty their pockets, and then ordered the \nyoung girl and the mother to lift their shirts and drop their pants--a \n10-year-old girl. A majority of the judges on Judge Alito's court said \nthat went too far; the search warrant did not authorize it. Judge Alito \nsaw it differently. He was the only judge on the court to say that the \nConstitution permitted this search.\n  The majority opinion in this case, incidentally, was written by \nMichael Chertoff. If the name is familiar, it is because then-Judge \nChertoff, a conservative Republican, today is in the President's \nCabinet as the head of our Department of Homeland Security. Judge \nChertoff, writing the majority opinion, said that what was done was \nwrong, and Judge Alito's decision was wrong.\n  In the context of reproductive freedom, I am troubled about whether \nJudge Alito accepts some of the basic rights of personal privacy. One \nof the cases which we should not forget was decided some 41 years ago \nby the Supreme Court. The case was Griswold v. Connecticut.\n  As hard as it may be to believe, there was a law in the State of \nConnecticut and in many other States, including my home State of \nIllinois, at that time which made it a crime for a married couple to \nbuy birth control devices or for a doctor to prescribe them or for a \npharmacist to fill the prescription. It was a crime for married couples \nto engage in family planning by buying any type of birth control \ndevice. It is hard to believe. That was America in the 1960s.\n  The Supreme Court took a look at this case and said that is wrong. \nThere is built into our rights as a citizen the right of privacy, and \nthat privacy goes to those intimate, personal decisions made by \nindividuals--in this case, husbands and wives--in the State of \nConnecticut. They struck down the Connecticut statute.\n  I asked Judge Alito what he thought about this Griswold decision and \nthis right of privacy. He was willing to say that Griswold is settled \nlaw. But, of course, Griswold v. Connecticut and the right of privacy \nwas the basis of a decision made a few years later in Roe v. Wade. In \nthat particular case, the Supreme Court built on this concept of a \nright of privacy and said that for a woman making the most important \nand personal decision of her life, in terms of the continuing of a \npregnancy, she had a protected status in certain stages of the \npregnancy. That was a decision which was handed down over 30 years \nago--33, as a matter of fact.\n  So we asked Judge Alito if he accepted that Griswold v. Connecticut, \nwhich established the right to privacy, was settled law in America, and \ndid he also accept that Roe v. Wade, which followed, was settled law? \nHe repeatedly refused to provide us with that assurance about this \nlandmark decision.\n  What a contrast to John Roberts, who, just a few months before when \nhe was nominated for the Chief Justice position on the Supreme Court \nand was asked the same question, said that he believed Roe v. Wade was \nsettled precedent in America. That is a defining difference between \nthese two nominees and an important one.\n  If Judge Alito is confirmed, there are very serious questions about \nwhat will happen with the right of privacy in America, not just for the \nwomen who could be affected by these decisions but for everyone.\n  It wasn't that long ago, a little over a year ago, that the Congress \nwas embroiled in a controversy over something that many families face \nevery day in America. You will remember the Terri Schiavo case, a sad \nsituation where some chemical imbalance led to Terri Schiavo going into \na coma. Her life was sustained by extraordinary means for 15 years \nwhile her husband argued that she never wanted it that way. She had \nmade it clear not to take extraordinary measures to keep her alive.\n  There was a battle within the family. Her parents saw it differently, \nand they went to court regularly to fight this out. Time and again, the \nFlorida courts reached the decision that what Terri Schiavo's husband \nsaid would be controlling and that her wishes would be honored and that \nextraordinary measures to keep her alive would be discontinued, and \nthen the case would be appealed.\n  Finally, the day came when all appeals had been resolved, and it was \napparent a decision would finally be made to remove the life support \nshe was receiving. It was at that moment when a group--a political \ngroup--inspired some Members of Congress to get involved. They started \narguing it was the time, at that moment, for the Federal courts to step \ninto the hospital room and for the Federal judges to make decisions \noverriding the State courts, overriding the stated wishes of Terri \nSchiavo, overriding the wishes of her husband.\n  There is hardly a person in the Senate who hasn't faced a similar \nfamily decision when someone you love is near the end of their life and \nthe doctor comes in and says there are several things we can do. I know \nin my family, my mother made it very clear to me she didn't want any of \nthat life support, extraordinary effort made. I was determined to honor \nher wishes. She passed away very quickly with a heart attack, and we \nnever had to face that decision, but we knew what she wanted. Her sons \nsaid they would stand by her wishes. Most people feel the same way. Do \nyou know why, Mr. President? Because it is an extremely private, \npersonal, and family issue. But in the case of Terri Schiavo, there \nwere those in the U.S. Congress, particularly in the House of \nRepresentatives, who wanted the Federal Government to step in at that \nmoment.\n  So when we talk about diminishing the right of privacy in America, it \ngoes far beyond the contentious issue of abortion. It goes to issues \ninvolving the last wishes of a person who is dying. It goes to issues \ninvolving protecting our privacy and our records, our computers, our \nmedical records, our financial records, and our credit history. The \nright of privacy has become a large part of American life, and I am \nconcerned when Judge Alito has drawn distinctions in saying there are \nsome elements of this right of privacy that he still is not certain are \nsettled law in America.\n  Another fear I have about Judge Alito is that he will not be \nrespectful of the time-honored system of checks and balances in this \ncountry when it comes to Presidential power. If confirmed, Judge Alito \nwill have to decide what limits, if any, the Constitution places on the \nPresident's authority over all of us.\n  Based on his record, I am concerned that Judge Alito will not be \nwilling to stand up to a President who is determined to seize too much \npower over our personal lives. In speeches to the ultraconservative \nFederalist Society which Judge Alito bragged about belonging to in the \n1980s, Judge Alito has said he is a ``strong proponent'' of the so-\ncalled ``unitary Executive theory,'' another phrase you won't find in \nthe Constitution. He even criticized the Supreme Court, specifically \nChief Justice Rehnquist, for failing to defer to this theory. During \nhis hearings, Judge Alito said he still supports key elements of the \ntheory today and indicated he will follow it, to some degree, in making \nhis decisions.\n\n  The same unitary executive theory has been the basis for many claims \nby the Bush administration that they had the Executive power to make \nsome of the most controversial decisions of their Presidency, including \nthe war on terrorism, the use of torture, and the power to eavesdrop on \nour phone conversations without court approval, as required by law.\n  Based on the unitary executive theory, the Bush administration has \nclaimed the right to seize American citizens and imprison them \nindefinitely without charge. In the Hamdi case, the Supreme Court, in \nan opinion written by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, rejected this \npolicy. Only one Justice\n\n[[Page S105]]\n\nvoted to uphold the administration's decision. That Justice, Clarence \nThomas, based his dissent on the unitary executive theory, the same \ngeneral theory to which Judge Alito says he subscribes.\n  It appears that if Judge Alito is approved for the Court, he will \njoin Justice Thomas and Justice Scalia as only the third Supreme Court \nJustice who has announced public support for this fringe theory called \nthe unitary executive theory which gives more and more power to the \nPresident and less restraint of law on his activities.\n  The Supreme Court is supposed to be a check on the power of the \nPresident. The Court's role is to interpret the Constitution, not to \nadvance some marginal theory of the Federalist Society or any other \nspecial interest group. During his hearings, Judge Alito did attempt to \ndistinguish his position on the unitary executive theory from the Bush \nadministration's, but he refused to say whether he disagreed with \nJustice Thomas' dissent in Hamdi, and he repeatedly refused to say \nwhether this President or any President has the right to disregard a \nlaw passed by Congress.\n  Several Senators asked Judge Alito about this directly, and several \ntimes he gave the same carefully worded response--and I quote it:\n\n       The President must take care that the statutes of the \n     United States that are consistent with the Constitution are \n     complied with.\n\n  Here is what we don't know about that statement: If the President \nclaims that a law is not consistent with the Constitution, can he \nignore the law with impunity? And if Judge Alito is on the Supreme \nCourt, is that how he would rule? That certainly is the way he answered \nthe question.\n  Presidents often issue formal statements when they sign a law. When \nJudge Alito was an attorney in President Reagan's Justice Department, \nhe advocated the use of Presidential signing statements to, in his own \nwords, ``increase the power of the Executive to shape the law.'' In \nthis way, Sam Alito argued ``the President will get in the last word on \nquestions of interpretation.''\n  The Framers of our Constitution didn't see it the same as Judge \nAlito. They said Congress was to have the last word.\n  The Bush administration has adopted Judge Alito's proposal. In more \nthan 100 Presidential signing statements, the Bush administration has \ncited unitary executive theory and pledged to uphold the law if it \ndoesn't conflict with this theory.\n  Just 3 weeks ago, we saw a good illustration. The White House issued \na Presidential signing statement claiming that the President could set \naside the McCain torture amendment which Congress passed overwhelmingly \nin December. Under what rationale could a President ignore a law that \npassed in this Chamber 90 to 9? The White House claimed the President \nhas the power under the ``unitary Executive theory.'' So hold on to \nyour seats, America. If Judge Alito goes onto the Court pushing this \ntheory that was inspired by the Federalist Society saying this \nPresident has extraordinary powers no President has ever had, it will \nconsolidate more power in the executive branch than our Founding \nFathers ever imagined.\n  Does any President have the power to ignore the McCain torture \namendment or FISA, the law that requires court approval to wiretap \nAmerican citizens? Based on his record, I am fearful that Judge Alito, \nfacing these questions, is more likely to defer to the President's \npower than defend our fundamental constitutional rights.\n  I will speak more to this issue about wiretaps in a moment.\n  I also fear that Judge Alito, if confirmed, would blur the \ntraditional line between church and state. In his 1985 job application \nessay, he indicated his disapproval of the Warren Court decisions on \nthe establishment clause of the Constitution.\n  What is the establishment clause? In the first amendment, the \nConstitution makes clear that we have the freedom of religious belief. \nOf course, that means each of us has the right under the law, under our \nConstitution, to believe any religious belief or to hold to no \nreligious belief. That is our basic freedom. It says:\n\n       Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of \n     religion. . . .\n\n  This was an understandable part of our Constitution because many of \nour Founding Fathers hailed from England, which had an official \nnational church. They wanted to make it clear that there would be a \nseparation, a clear wall of separation between church and state, as \nThomas Jefferson said in the early 1800s.\n  The Warren Court, led by Earl Warren, as Chief Justice, struck down \ngovernment-sponsored prayer and government-sponsored devotional Bible \nreading in public schools, arguing that it violated the establishment \nclause. The decisions by the Warren Court were nearly unanimous. They \nstood for the proposition, as the Constitution said, that our \ngovernment must be neutral toward religion in order to maintain this \nhealthy separation of church and state. This concept of government \nneutrality is the bedrock of today's mainstream establishment clause \nthinking, and it is led by none other than Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. \nYet from a review of Judge Alito's 15 years on the Federal bench, it is \nclear that Judge Alito has serious reservations about whether \ngovernment should be neutral toward religion, as our Constitution \nrequires.\n\n  I think we ought to reflect on this long and hard. We live in a \ncountry of diverse religious belief. We try to show respect for each \nperson's religious belief, and we make it clear that our government \nwon't pick favorites among religions. We can only look overseas to \nother countries that are torn with strife over religious divisions to \nunderstand the wisdom of our Founding Fathers, a wisdom that should be \nhonored by our Supreme Court.\n  The rulings of Judge Sam Alito on the Third Circuit raise questions \nas to whether he will continue to protect the separation of church and \nstate that has served America so well.\n  Let me speak for a moment about a timely issue which is not only in \nthe headlines but really relates directly to this confirmation \nconsideration of Judge Alito. Like many Americans, I am deeply \nconcerned about recent revelations that sometime in 2001, President \nBush authorized the National Security Agency to begin spying on \nAmericans in the United States without court approval. This is an \napparent violation of law.\n  Let me say at the outset, this is not about whether we should wiretap \nterrorists. Of course, we should. We should use every legal tool \navailable to put an end to Osama bin Laden's deadly franchise.\n  Under a law called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or \nFISA, the President has broad authority to wiretap suspected \nterrorists. The FISA Court has been virtually a rubberstamp for \nPresidents asking for wiretap orders. In fact, over 19,000 requests \nhave been made of this court to wiretap suspected terrorists, and the \nadministration has been denied only 4 times. 19,000 requests, 4 \ndenials.\n  Within the FISA law there is an emergency exception so if there is a \nsuspicion that a conversation about to take place needs to be \nwiretapped to protect America, the Government can move quickly, without \ncourt approval, so long as they go through the regular process within \n72 hours. So the Government can act if they suspect that a conversation \nwould lead to terrorism and endanger Americans.\n  So the President has authority, under this Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, to engage in the activities he has described to the \nAmerican people: time-sensitive electronic surveillance on suspected \nterrorists.\n  What this debate really is about is the President's constitutional \nobligation to follow the laws of the land. Legal scholars, former \nGovernment officials from both political parties, and the nonpartisan \nCongressional Research Service have all concluded that the NSA program \nappears to violate the law.\n  Even President Bush has recognized it is improper to wiretap \nAmericans in the United States without court approval. Listen to what \nPresident Bush said in a speech to the American people on April 20, \n2004. I quote it verbatim:\n\n       Now, by the way, any time you hear the U.S. Government \n     talking about wiretapping, it requires--a wiretap requires a \n     court order. Nothing has changed, by the way. When we are \n     talking about chasing down terrorists we are talking about \n     getting a court order before we do so.\n\n\n[[Page S106]]\n\n\n  That is the end of the quote, April 20, 2004, after the President had \ninitiated this NSA wiretapping that is not approved by law and does not \nuse a court order.\n  When President Bush concluded over 4 years ago that he wanted to \neavesdrop on Americans without the court approval required by law, he \nhad an obligation to come to Congress and ask us to change the law.\n  Congress has always been a willing partner when the President has \nrequested additional authority to fight terrorism. I can recall the \nPresident, within days of 9/11, asking for an authorization for the use \nof force by this Congress to go after Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida, \nwhich I readily voted for. There was unanimous support for a bipartisan \nresolution which passed the Senate.\n  Shortly thereafter, the President came to Congress and asked us to \npass the PATRIOT Act. It was an act that gave the Government more \nauthority, more tools, more legal ways to go after terrorism in the \nUnited States. It was overwhelmingly approved with only one dissenting \nvote in the Senate. Within the PATRIOT Act, the President asked for \nsome changes in this FISA law to make it easier to wiretap terrorists.\n  So the administration at this point seems to concede the point that \nthey were bound by this law and were looking for changes so they could \nuse it, in their words, more effectively. We tried to accommodate them \nas much as we possibly could. When the White House asked Congress to \npass this bill, we cooperated with them. Members of Congress from both \nsides of the aisle were happy to work with the President to keep \nAmerica safe.\n  That is not what the President has done here. Instead, we have \nlearned that the President has not followed even the law that he asked \nus to change. He claims the power to eavesdrop on the phone \nconversations of Americans and e-mails without any court approval, \nwithout any legal authority.\n  That raises fundamental questions. Is this President or any President \nabove the law? Does the President have the authority to disregard laws \npassed by Congress, whether it is the question of torture or \neavesdropping? Can Congress place any limits on the President's power \nover our lives?\n  Today I joined the distinguished minority leader, Senator Harry Reid, \nand my colleagues, Senators Kennedy and Feingold, and sent a letter to \nPresident Bush. We have urgently requested that the President notify us \nimmediately of the changes in the law that he believes are necessary to \npermit effective surveillance of suspected terrorists and why the \nchanges are needed.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate.\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 25, 2006.\n     President George W. Bush,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Bush: We strongly support efforts to do \n     everything possible, within the limits of the law, to combat \n     terrorism. We are therefore gravely concerned that sometime \n     in 2001, in apparent violation of federal law, you authorized \n     the National Security Agency (NSA) to eavesdrop on Americans \n     in the United States without court approval.\n       When you concluded over four years ago that existing law \n     did not provide you sufficient authority to conduct this \n     program, you had an obligation to propose changes in the law \n     to Congress. Rather than doing so, you have apparently chosen \n     to ignore the law. We urgently request that you notify us \n     immediately what changes in the law you believe are necessary \n     to permit effective surveillance of suspected terrorists, and \n     why these changes are needed.\n       The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) gives the \n     government broad authority to wiretap suspected terrorists. \n     Federal law provides that FISA and the criminal wiretap \n     statute ``shall be the exclusive means by which electronic \n     surveillance . . . and the interception of domestic wire, \n     oral, and electronic communications may be conducted.'' 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 2511(2)(f). FISA makes it a crime, punishable by \n     up to five years in prison, to conduct electronic \n     surveillance except as permitted by statute. 50 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1809.\n       In fact, you have recognized that it is improper to subject \n     Americans in the United States to warrantless wiretapping. In \n     a speech on April 20, 2004, you said: ``Now, by the way, any \n     time you hear the United States government talking about \n     wiretap, it requires--a wiretap requires a court order. \n     Nothing has changed, by the way. When we're talking about \n     chasing down terrorists, we're talking about getting a court \n     order before we do so.''\n       You and officials in your administration have repeatedly \n     asserted that FISA does not provide adequate authority to \n     monitor suspected terrorists. However, FISA authorizes \n     monitoring suspected terrorists, who are the purported \n     targets of NSA's warrantless wiretaps. Moreover, FISA \n     includes an emergency exception for situations where there is \n     insufficient time to obtain judicial approval before \n     beginning a wiretap. This exception allows the government \n     to commence electronic surveillance immediately, as long \n     as it seeks a court order within 72 hours. 50 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1805(f). During the course of its existence, the FISA \n     court has approved over 19,000 wiretap applications from \n     the government while disapproving only four.\n       It therefore appears that your administration has \n     sufficient authority under FISA to engage in the activities \n     you have described--time-sensitive electronic surveillance of \n     suspected terrorists.\n       Officials in your administration have asserted that the \n     government's internal process for preparing and authorizing a \n     FISA application is too burdensome and slow to monitor \n     suspected terrorists effectively. To be clear, your \n     administration's bureaucratic and paperwork delays are not an \n     excuse for violating the law. As the nonpartisan \n     Congressional Research Service (CRS) concluded: ``To the \n     extent that a lack of speed and agility is a function of \n     internal Department of Justice procedures and practices under \n     FISA, it may be argued that the President and the Attorney \n     General could review these procedures and practices in order \n     to introduce more streamlined procedures to address such \n     needs.'' CRS Memorandum, Presidential Authority to Conduct \n     Warrantless Electronic Surveillance to Gather Foreign \n     Intelligence Information, by Elizabeth A. Bazan & Jennifer K. \n     Elsea.\n       If you or officials in your administration believe that \n     FISA, or any law, does not give you enough authority to \n     combat terrorism, you should propose changes in the law to \n     Congress. You may not simply disregard the law.\n       In your December 19, 2005 press conference, you called FISA \n     ``a very important tool.'' FISA is more than a tool; it is a \n     law, and we are a nation of laws. Under Article 1 of the \n     Constitution, Congress has the power to make laws. Under \n     Article 2 of the Constitution, you must take care that the \n     laws are faithfully executed.\n       In order to win the war on terrorism, we must maintain the \n     high ground by respecting the rule of law as embodied in our \n     Constitution. To do otherwise makes us weaker as a nation and \n     harms our national security. The Supreme Court long ago \n     rejected the notion that there is a wartime exception to the \n     Constitution's separation of powers. As the Court concluded \n     in the historic Youngstown Steel case: ``The Constitution is \n     neither silent nor equivocal about who shall make laws which \n     the President is to execute. . . . The Founders of this \n     Nation entrusted the lawmaking power to the Congress alone in \n     both good and bad times.'' 343 U.S. 579, 587-89 (1952).\n       In light of the very serious nature of this matter, we \n     request that you respond to this letter as soon as possible, \n     and, in any case, no later than February 1, 2006.\n           Sincerely,\n     Harry Reid,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Edward M. Kennedy,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Richard J. Durbin,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Russell D. Feingold,\n       U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. The President cannot continue to simply disregard the \nlaw.\n  At a press conference on December 19, 2005, President Bush called \nFISA ``a very important tool.'' I would say to the President, FISA is \nmore than a tool. It is a law, and we are a nation of laws.\n  Our Constitution separates powers between different branches of \nGovernment. Under article I of the Constitution, Congress has the power \nto make laws. Under article 2 of the Constitution, the President must \ntake care that the laws are faithfully executed.\n  The Supreme Court has faced questions like this in the past, \nquestions regarding the powers of the President in the midst of a war. \nDuring the Korean war, President Harry Truman violated the law by \nseizing America's steel mills to aid the war effort. In the historic \nYoungstown Steel case, the Court rejected President Truman's actions \nand concluded:\n\n       The Constitution is neither silent nor equivocal about who \n     shall make laws which the President is to execute. . . . The \n     Founders of this Nation entrusted the lawmaking power to the \n     Congress alone in both good and bad times.\n\n  In order to win the war on terrorism, we must maintain the high \nground by respecting our Constitution and respecting the laws of the \nland. To do otherwise makes us weaker as a nation and harms our \nnational security.\n\n[[Page S107]]\n\n  And that is what is at stake with this Supreme Court nomination. \nJudge Sam Alito, from his early days in the Reagan administration, \nthrough the rulings in his court and his testimony before the Judiciary \nCommittee, time and again seems to defer to the Executive's assertions \nof power. At this moment in history, like none other in recent times, \nthat is a critical and timely issue. We have to ask the question, would \nthis judge on the Court protect our basic privacy and personal freedom \nor would he give to this President power to ignore the law?\n  Last week Attorney General Gonzales issued a long memo supporting the \nadministration's position on the NSA spying program. That memo went so \nfar as to suggest that this administration is not even bound by the \nPATRIOT Act. It suggests that the President can use the powers \nauthorized by the PATRIOT Act without even the limited checks and \nbalances contained in the PATRIOT Act, regardless of what Congress \nsays.\n  So what has happened is the administration has gone from the question \nof torture to this whole question of eavesdropping, and now has \nsuggested that this President has the authority to do whatever he cares \nto do in the name of his power as Commander in Chief.\n  The Supreme Court in the past has not agreed with Presidents who have \ntried to seize that much power. President Truman learned that the hard \nway. I am hopeful this Supreme Court will respect the Constitution and \nrespect the laws of the land and restrain this President or any \nPresident who tries to move that far and that fast.\n  So it comes down to this with the Alito nomination. I am afraid as we \nlook carefully at his record it is clear that he would allow the \nGovernment to go too far, to intrude on our personal privacy and our \nfreedoms. I am afraid that he would take the country in the wrong \ndirection when it comes to women's rights and civil rights. I am afraid \nthat his record, as I mentioned earlier on the floor today, is evidence \nthat when he is given a choice between ruling in court for an \nestablished institution--whether it is a business or a government--or \nstanding with a consumer or an individual, he consistently rules for \nthe established institution. I am afraid that the 1985 memo, which \nbecame a large part of his recent hearing, still guides Judge Alito in \nmany respects in his heart of hearts.\n  I think the fact that Harriet Miers was rejected by so many \nconservative groups and the President had to withdraw her nomination \nhas to be taken into consideration here. Judge Sam Alito came as her \nsuccessor, as the nominee. The same groups that had rejected her \naccepted Sam Alito. They know or believe they know what I have spoken \nof this evening, that his is a philosophy that is outside the \nmainstream, that is not consistent with the values of this country and \nnot consistent with the fine record written by Justice Sandra Day \nO'Connor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, yesterday in Burbank, CA, I gave a major \naddress before my constituents announcing my opposition to the \nnomination of Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  Today I am announcing my opposition to the nomination of Samuel Alito \nto the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  According to article II of the Constitution, Justices of the Supreme \nCourt may not be appointed by the President without the advice and \nconsent of the Senate. So it is our solemn duty to consider each \nnomination carefully, keeping in mind the interests of the American \npeople.\n  This nomination is particularly crucial because the stakes have \nrarely been so high.\n  First, consider the context in which this nomination comes before us. \nThe seat that Judge Alito has been nominated for is now held by Justice \nSandra Day O'Connor, who came to the Court in 1981.\n  For years, Justice O'Connor has provided the tie-breaking vote and a \ncommonsense voice of reason in some of the most important cases to come \nbefore the Court, including a woman's right to choose, civil rights, \nand freedom of religion.\n  Second, consider the tumultuous political climate in our Nation. \nPresident Bush understood that in 2000 when he promised to govern from \nthe center, and be ``a uniter, not a divider.'' Sadly, this nomination \nshows that he has forgotten that promise because it is not from the \ncenter and it is not uniting the Nation.\n  The right thing to do would have been to give us a justice in the \nmold of Justice O'Connor, and that is what the President should have \ndone.\n  Let me be clear: I do not deny Judge Alito's judicial qualifications. \nHe has been a government lawyer and judge for more than 20 years and \nthe American Bar Association rated him well qualified. He is an \nintelligent and capable person. His family should be proud of him and \nall Americans should be proud that the American dream was there for the \nAlito family.\n  But after reviewing the hearing record and the record of his \nstatements, writings and rulings over the past 24 years, I am convinced \nthat Judge Alito is the wrong person for this job.\n  I am deeply concerned about how Justice Alito will impact the ability \nof other families to live the American dream to be assured of privacy \nin their homes and their personal lives, to be secure in their \nneighborhoods, to have fair treatment in the workplace, and to have \nconfidence that the power of the executive branch will be checked.\n  As I reviewed Judge Alito's record, I asked whether he will vote to \npreserve fundamental American liberties and values.\n  Will Justice Alito vote to uphold Congress's constitutional power to \npass laws to protect Americans' health, safety, and welfare? Judge \nAlito's record says no.\n  In the 1996 Rybar case, Judge Alito voted to strike down the Federal \nban on the transfer or possession of machine guns because he believed \nit exceeded Congress's power under the Commerce Clause. His Third \nCircuit colleagues sharply criticized his dissent and said that it ran \ncounter to ``a basic tenet of the constitutional separation of \npowers.'' And Judge Alito's extremist view has been rejected by six \nother circuit courts and the Supreme Court. Judge Alito stood alone and \nfailed to protect our families.\n  In a case concerning worker protection, Judge Alito was again in the \nminority when he said that Federal mine health and safety standards did \nnot apply to a coal processing site. He tried to explain it as just a \n``technical issue of interpretation.'' I fear for the safety of our \nworkers if Judge Alito's narrow, technical reading of the law should \never prevail.\n  Will Justice Alito vote to protect the right to privacy, especially a \nwoman's reproductive freedom? Judge Alito's record says no.\n  We have all heard about Judge Alito's 1985 job application, in which \nhe wrote that the Constitution does not protect the right of a woman to \nchoose. He was given the chance to disavow that position during the \nhearings and he refused to do so. He had the chance to say, as Judge \nRoberts did, that Roe v. Wade is settled law, and he refused.\n  He had the chance to explain his dissent in the Casey decision, in \nwhich he argued that the Pennsylvania spousal notification requirement \nwas not an undue burden on a woman seeking an abortion because it would \naffect only a small number of women, but he refused to back away from \nhis position. The Supreme Court, by a 5 to 4 vote, found the provision \nto be unconstitutional, and Justice O'Connor, co-writing for the Court, \ncriticized the faulty analysis supported by Judge Alito, saying that \n``the analysis does not end with the one percent of women'' affected . \n. . ``it begins there.''\n  To my mind, Judge Alito's ominous statements and narrow-minded \nreasoning clearly signal a hostility to women's rights, and portend a \nmove back toward the dark days when abortion was illegal in many \nstates, and many women died as a result. In the 21st century, it is \nastounding that a Supreme Court nominee would not view Roe v. Wade as \nsettled law when its fundamental principle a woman's right to choose--\nhas been reaffirmed many times since it was decided.\n  Will Justice Alito vote to protect Americans from unconstitutional \nsearches? Judge Alito's record says no.\n  In Doe v. Groody in 2004, he said a police strip search of a 10-year-\nold girl was lawful, even though their search warrant didn't name her. \nJudge Alito said that even if the warrant did not actually authorize \nthe search of the\n\n[[Page S108]]\n\ngirl, ``a reasonable police officer could certainly have read the \nwarrant as doing so . . .'' This casual attitude toward one of our most \nbasic constitutional guarantees--the fourth amendment right against \nunreasonable searches--is almost shocking. As Judge Alito's own Third \nCircuit Court said regarding warrants, ``a particular description is \nthe touchstone of the Fourth Amendment.'' We certainly do not need \nSupreme Court Justices who do not understand this fundamental \nconstitutional protection.\n  Will Justice Alito vote to let citizens stop companies from polluting \ntheir communities? Judge Alito's record says no.\n  In the Magnesium Elektron case, Judge Alito voted to make it harder \nfor citizens to sue for toxic emissions that violate the Clean Water \nAct. Fortunately, in another case several years later, the Supreme \nCourt rejected the Third Circuit and Alito's narrow reading of the law. \nJudge Alito doesn't seem to care about a landmark environmental law.\n  Will Justice Alito vote to let working women and men have their day \nin court against employers who discriminate against them? Judge Alito's \nrecord says no.\n  In 1997, in the Bray case, Judge Alito was the only judge on the \nThird Circuit to say that a hotel employee claiming racial \ndiscrimination could not take her case to a jury.\n  In the Sheridan case, a female employee sued for discrimination, \nalleging that after she complained about incidents of sexual \nharassment, she was demoted and marginalized to the point that she was \nforced to quit. By a vote of 10 to 1, the Third Circuit found for the \nplaintiff.\n  Guess who was the one? Only Judge Alito thought the employee should \nhave to show that discrimination was the ``determinative cause'' of the \nemployer's action. Using his standard would make it almost impossible \nfor a woman claiming discrimination in the workplace to get to trial.\n  Finally, will Justice Alito be independent from the executive branch \nthat appointed him, and be a vote against power grabs by the president? \nJudge Alito's record says no.\n  As a lawyer in the Reagan Justice Department, he authored a memo \nsuggesting a new way for the President to encroach on Congress's \nlawmaking powers. He said that when the President signs a law, he \nshould make a statement about the law, giving it his own \ninterpretation, whether it was consistent with what Congress had \nwritten or not. He wrote that this would ``get in the last word on \nquestions of interpretation'' of the law. In the hearings, Judge Alito \nrefused to back away from this memo.\n  When asked whether he believed the President could invade another \ncountry, in the absence of an imminent threat, without first getting \nthe approval of the American people, of Congress, Judge Alito refused \nto rule it out.\n  When asked if the President had the power to authorize someone to \nengage in torture, Alito refused to answer.\n  The administration is now asserting vast powers, including spying on \nAmerican citizens without seeking warrants--in clear violation of the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act--violating international \ntreaties, and ignoring laws that ban torture. We need Justices who will \nput a check on such overreaching by the executive, not rubberstamp it. \nJudge Alito's record and his answers at the hearings raise very serious \ndoubts about his commitment to being a strong check on an `imperial \nPresident.'\n  In addition to these substantive matters, I remain concerned about \nJudge Alito's answers regarding his membership in the Concerned Alumni \nof Princeton and his failure to recuse himself from the Vanguard case, \nwhich he had promised to do.\n  During the hearings, we all felt great compassion for Mrs. Alito when \nshe became emotional in reaction to the tough questions her husband \nfaced in the Judiciary Committee. Everyone in politics knows how hard \nit is for families when a loved one is asked tough questions. It is \npart of a difficult process, and whoever said politics is not for the \nfaint of heart was right.\n  Emotions have run high during this process. That is understandable. \nBut I wish the press had focused more on the tears of those who will be \naffected if Judge Alito becomes Justice Alito and his out-of-the-\nmainstream views prevail.\n  I worry about the tears of a worker who, having failed to get a \npromotion because of discrimination, is denied the opportunity to \npursue her claim in court.\n  I worry about the tears of a mentally ill woman who is forced by law \nto tell her husband that she wants to terminate her pregnancy and is \nafraid that he will leave her or stop supporting her.\n  I worry about the tears of a young girl who is strip searched in her \nown home by police who have no valid warrant.\n  I worry about the tears of a mentally retarded man, who has been \nbrutally assaulted in his workplace, when his claim of workplace \nharassment is dismissed by the court simply because his lawyer failed \nto file a well-written brief on his behalf.\n  These are real cases in which Judge Alito has spoken. Fortunately, he \ndid not prevail in these cases. But if he goes to the Supreme Court, he \nwill have a much more powerful voice--a radical voice that will replace \na voice of moderation and balance.\n  Perhaps the most important statement Judge Alito made during the \nentire hearing process was when he told the Judiciary Committee that he \nexpects to be the same kind of Justice on the Supreme Court as he has \nbeen a judge on the Circuit Court.\n  That is precisely the problem. As a judge, Samuel Alito seemed to \napproach his cases with an analytical coldness that reflected no \nconcern for the human consequences of his reasoning.\n  Listen to what he said about a case involving an African-American man \nconvicted of murder by an all-White jury in a courtroom where the \nprosecutors had eliminated all African-American jurors in many previous \nmurder trials as well.\n  Judge Alito dismissed this evidence of racial bias and said that the \njury makeup was no more relevant than the fact that left-handers have \nwon five of the last six Presidential elections. When asked about this \nanalogy during the hearings, he said it ``went to the issue of \nstatistics . . . (which) is a branch of mathematics, and there are ways \nto analyze statistics so that you draw sound conclusions from them. . . \n.''\n  That response would have been appropriate for a college math \nprofessor, but it is deeply troubling from a potential Supreme Court \nJustice.\n  As the great jurist and Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, \nJr. wrote in 1881, ``The life of the law has not been logic; it has \nbeen experience . . . The law embodies the story of a nation's \ndevelopment through many centuries, and it cannot be dealt with as if \nit contained only the axioms and corollaries of a book of \nmathematics.''\n  What Holmes meant is that the law is a living thing, that those who \ninterpret it must do so with wisdom and humanity, and with an \nunderstanding of the consequences of their judgments for the lives of \nthe people they affect.\n  It is with deep regret that I conclude that Judge Alito's judicial \nphilosophy lacks this wisdom, humanity and moderation.

WHAT GIRLS SAY ABOUT HEALTHY \n                                 LIVING\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, America is confronting a childhood obesity \ncrisis, and over the past 25 years, the percentage of overweight girls \nhas more than doubled--to 16 percent of girls ages 6 to 19, up from 6 \npercent in 1974.\n  To support the search for a solution, the Girl Scout Research \nInstitute\n\n[[Page S109]]\n\nasked girls directly how they define health and what motivates them to \nlead a healthier lifestyle. The results are captured in a new report, \ntitled The New Normal? What Girls Say About Healthy Living.\n  This new report brings the voice of girls to the forefront of the \nconversation on childhood obesity for the first time and finds that \ngirls are in many ways ahead of the curve, using a varied, complex set \nof norms to define health.\n  Today's girls are defining ``health'' on their own terms, placing the \nsame value on emotional well-being and self-esteem as they do on diet \nand exercise. For girls, being healthy is more than just eating right \nand exercising; it is also about feeling good about oneself and being \nsupported by family and peers.\n  Girls say that efforts to reduce childhood and adolescent obesity \nthat focus solely on nutrition or physical activity miss the mark.\n  The study lays out four key findings:\n  One, girls aspire to be ``normal healthy,'' a concept they often \nassociate with appearing normal and being supported by peers and \nfamily. Girls tended to view any diet or lifestyle choice as healthy as \nlong as it doesn't harm their appearance or their relationships with \nfriends and family. Overall, 65 percent of girls say their lifestyle is \n``healthy enough for my age,'' while just 16 percent describe their \nlifestyle as ``very healthy.'' Although about two-thirds, 65 percent, \ncorrectly identify themselves as being either normal weight or \noverweight, one in three girls has a distorted idea about her weight. \nOlder girls also tended to be less satisfied with their weight than \nyounger girls.\n  Two, girls have a holistic view of health and describe emotional \nhealth as important as physical health. Virtually all girls agree that \nemotional health is as important as physical health--and 88 percent of \n11- to 17-year-old girls believe that feeling good about yourself is \nmore important than how you look. More than a third of girls ages 11-17 \nreported eating more when they are ``stressed out'' and overweight \ngirls are more than twice as likely as girls who are not overweight to \nreport eating more in times of stress.\n  Three, girls already know what is healthy, but many don't use the \ninformation they have to make healthy choices. Obstacles at home \ninclude a decline in the frequency of family meals and increased \ntelevision watching and computer use as girls get older. A third of \ngirls experience sit down to a family meal no more than twice a week. \nMore than 60 percent of teenage girls skip breakfast at least once a \nweek and nearly 20 percent skip it every day.\n  Obstacles at school include reliance on vending machines, poor taste \nand quality of school lunches, optional physical education classes, and \na lack of access to more informal physical activities are all barriers. \nMany girls ages 11-17 say they do not play sports because they do not \nfeel skilled or competent, 40 percent, or because they do not think \ntheir bodies look good, 23 percent.\n  Four, girls cite their mothers not only as role models but also as \nleading sources of nutritional information and emotional reinforcement. \nMothers exert tremendous influence. Girls tend to mirror their mothers' \nactivity levels, weight and body image. And given the increasingly poor \ndiet and sedentary lifestyle of today's adults, it is clear that \nefforts to improve the health of girls must also target parents--\nespecially mothers.\n  Continuing a 93-year tradition begun by founder Juliette Gordon Low, \nGirl Scouts offers an array of successful initiatives and age-\nappropriate curricula in health, nutrition, and fitness--including more \nthan 60 badges and awards related to healthy living. And the findings \nof The New Normal? What Girls Say About Healthy Living, will continue \nthis tradition in helping inform GSUSA's ongoing program and policy \nwork.\n  To turn this research into action today, Girl Scouts is encouraging \nall girls and their families to engage in advocacy at the local level. \nAdvocacy is a critical component in educating and influencing key \npolicy and decision makers as well as the general public about what \ngirls need to lead healthy lives. To bring girls' voices to the \ndiscussion about health in their communities, Girl Scouts is calling on \nall girls to become involved in the development and implementation of \ntheir local School Wellness Policy.\n  Ninety-five percent of schools must establish a school wellness \nprogram consisting of nutrition and physical activity goals by the \nfirst day of the 2006-2007 school year. We want girls to take action \nthrough advocacy on this timely and important issue so that as schools \naddress the wellness of our Nation's children and youth, the unique \ngirl-perspective is fully considered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/25/senate-section/article/S109-1", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S109-S110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IN MEMORY OF JOHN ROBERT MURREN, M.D.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to remember Dr. John Robert \nMurren, a renowned oncologist, cancer researcher, and a beloved \nhusband, father and son.\n  I first met Dr. Murren 3\\1/2\\ years ago. He visited me in my Capitol \noffice with his brother and sister-in-law, Jim and Heather Murren. In \nthis meeting, they shared with me their vision for a new world-class \ncancer research facility in Nevada.\n  Like so many Americans, the Murrens had been touched by cancer. They \nhad witnessed first-hand the devastation caused by cancer and were \nmotivated to do something to lessen the toll of this horrible illness. \nAs such, the Murrens resolved to combine Heather and Jim's business \nskills and extensive network with John's medical expertise to create a \ncutting-edge comprehensive cancer institute in Nevada. In 2002, they \nfounded the Nevada Cancer Institute and built a 142,000 square foot \nfacility in Las Vegas that is dedicated to researching, preventing, \ndetecting, and curing cancer. Dr. John Murren served on the institute's \nboard of directors as well as an adjunct faculty member. Dr. Murren's \ndeath will inspire those he left behind to make the Nevada Cancer \nInstitute even better. John would want this.\n  Dr. John Murren's vision for the Nevada Cancer Institute was based on \nan impressive medical foundation. He earned his B.A. in chemistry and \nhistory from Duke University cum laude followed by his M.D. in 1984 \nfrom the Loyola-Stritch School of Medicine in Chicago. He completed his \ninternship and residency in Internal Medicine at St. Vincent's Hospital \nin New York where he was chief resident. In 1988, Dr. Murren accepted a \npostdoctoral fellowship in medical oncology at the Yale-New Haven \nHospital where he was an attending physician as well as an associate \nprofessor of medicine. Since 1992, he had been awarded grant funding to \nstudy cancer drug therapies yielding invaluable contributions to the \nunderstanding of the effectiveness of cancer drug therapies, \nparticularly chemotherapy.\n  Dr. Murren was the chief of the Yale Medical Oncology Outpatient \nClinic and director of the Lung Cancer Unit at the Yale Cancer Center \nin New Haven, Connecticut. At Yale, Dr. Murren had the largest clinical \npractice at the Cancer Center and treated thousands of patients and \ntheir families over a distinguished career. His clinical research \nwidely published. He sat on several peer-review boards and was sought \nout worldwide for his expertise. He was also a member of the board of \ntrustees of the Frisbee Foundation.\n  In addition to his clinical, educational, and research endeavors, Dr. \nMurren served on the Clinical Research Subcommittee of the American \nAssociation of Cancer Research and the American College of Surgeons \nCancer Committee. He also served as cochair of Novel Therapeutics for \nthe American Association of Cancer Research National Meeting in 2001. \nHe was a member of the Research Grants Council in Hong Kong and was an \nactive lecturer and writer.\n  The loss of Dr. Murren will be felt beyond medical and scientific \ncircles. Dr Murren is survived by Nancy, his wife; John, his son; Jean \nPerkins Murren, his mother; Jim and Michael, his brothers and Kathie, \nhis sister as well as sisters-in-law: Heather Hay Murren and Mary Kay \nMurren and brothers-in-law George Koether as well as Jeff and Bill \nHughes and wives, family and mother-in-law, Doris Hughes, as well as \nseveral nieces and nephews.\n  Dr. Murren will be missed by his community in Fairfield, CT, where he\n\n[[Page S110]]\n\nled an active life. He was a parishioner of St. Thomas Roman Catholic \nchurch there, and he enjoyed reading, skiing, tennis, and watching his \nson, John, play ice hockey.\n  No one is immune to cancer not even those individuals who, like Dr. \nMurren, dedicate their life's work to cancer research and treating \nindividuals suffering from cancer. If we in Congress want to honor the \nlife of Dr. Murren and the 1 million Americans who will be diagnosed \nwith cancer this year, then we must invest more Federal money into \ncancer research. Otherwise, we will continue to lose too many of our \nfamily members and friends to this devastating illness.\n  In closing, I extend to his family, friends, and associates, my \nsympathy on the passing of a good American, Dr. John Murren. It is my \nwish that his legacy will be a country that defeats the dreaded disease \nwe call cancer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/25/senate-section/article/S110-1", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S110-S111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                        Sergeant Tobias Meister\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor an heroic American \nwho has fallen while serving his country in Operation Enduring Freedom \nin Afghanistan. First Sergeant Tobias Meister died December 28, 2005, \nwhen a bomb was detonated near his humvee just south of Asadabad, \nAfghanistan. First Sergeant Meister was part of the Sand Springs based \n486th Civil Affairs Battalion and was assigned to the Army Reserve's \n321st Civil Affairs Brigade based in San Antonio, TX. My deepest \nsympathies go out to his wife Alicia, his 1 year old son Will, his \nparents David and Judy, his brother and many more family and friends.\n  First Sergeant Meister was born in Kingsley, IA and graduated from \nRemsen-Union High School in 1994. He was employed by Horizon Natural \nResources, an oil and gas firm, after he had successfully completed a \nbusiness administration degree with a concentration in international \nbusiness from the University of Texas at San Antonio.\n  Tobias Meister joined the Iowa National Guard in 1992 and served as \nan infantryman before transferring to the U.S. Army Reserve in 1998. He \nwas named Drill Sergeant of the Year in 2002, the award for the \nNation's top Army Reserve drill sergeant. He will be remembered for his \npatriotism, his love for his country and his fellow soldiers. As \nwritten by comrades on his website, he had ``so much passion for what \nhe was doing, so much patriotism it was a privilege and an honor to \nwork with him.'' I urge all of my colleagues here and all Americans to \nextend their prayers to the family of a truly heroic American, First \nSergeant Tobias Meister.\n\n\n                         ROLAND CARROLL BARVELS\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Roland \nCarroll Barvels who died in Iraq on January 18, 2006. Roland was \nemployed with DynCorp International and was assigned to the Civilian \nPolice Advisory Training Team in Iraq. He was helping to train and \nequip a 350,000-member Iraqi security force. Sadly, he was killed when \na roadside bomb struck his convoy near Basra.\n  Prior to joining DynCorp in November 2005, Barvels answered his \nNation's call to duty to protect and defend this great country. After \nserving for 12 years in the military, he became a police officer. \nBeginning his career in Minnesota, Barvels eventually served in law \nenforcement for nearly 20 years including his most recent position with \nthe Aberdeen Police Department.\n  Friends and former co-workers at the Aberdeen Police Department \nremember Roland with deep admiration. One colleague remarked, ``During \nhis time at the police department, he diligently patrolled the streets \nof our city providing safety and security to the citizens in our \ncommunity. Roland possessed an incredible ability to talk to people and \n[to] make anyone he talked to feel at ease.''\n  Roland Barvels bravely served our country in so many ways. His wife \nand children are in the thoughts and prayers of my family during this \ndifficult time. It is my sincere hope that they will take comfort \nknowing Ronald's long and distinguished career of protecting those most \nin need is truly admirable, and his dedication to helping others is an \ninspiration to us all.\n  I join with all South Dakotans in expressing my deepest sympathy to \nthe family and friends of Roland Barvels. He will be missed, but his \nservice to our Nation will never be forgotten.\n\n\n                      Specialist Matthew C. Frantz\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from \nLafayette. Matthew Frantz, 23 years old, died on January 20 when an \nimprovised explosive device detonated near his vehicle during a patrol \nnear Al Huwijah in Iraq. With his entire life before him, Matthew \nrisked everything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our \nhearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  Following in the family tradition of service, Matthew had been \ncommitted to joining the military since he was in the second grade. A \n2001 graduate of Lafayette Jefferson High School, his teachers recalled \nhow eager he was to join the service, as well as what a decent and \nfriendly student he was. One of his teachers told a local news outlet, \n``Matt was very excited about being part of the military. It was what \nhe wanted to do. He was just a young man that wanted to serve his \ncountry.'' Matthew had been in the military for nearly 2 years, but \nthis was his first deployment to Iraq. He arrived there only 4 months \nago as a counterintelligence specialist.\n  Matthew was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. He was a member of the 1st Special Troops Battalion in the \n101st Airborne Division based at Fort Campbell, KT. This brave young \nsoldier leaves behind his father and mother, James and Marilyn Frantz; \nhis brothers, Chris and Eric, who also serve in the military; and his \nfiance, Amalia Cerbin.\n  Today, I join Matthew's family and friends in mourning his death. \nWhile we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take \npride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Matthew, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Matthew was known for his dedication to his family and his love of \ncountry. Today and always, Matthew will be remembered by family \nmembers, friends, and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we \nhonor the sacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Matthew's sacrifice, \nI am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the \nfamilies of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we \ncannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living \nand dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor \npower to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember \nwhat we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This \nstatement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am \ncertain that the impact of Matthew's actions will live on far longer \nthat any record of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Matthew C. Frantz in the \nofficial record of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and \nfor his profound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When I \nthink about this just cause in which we are engaged and the unfortunate \npain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like \nMatthew's can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, \n``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away \ntears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Matthew.\n\n\n                        Sergeant Clifton Yazzie\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I humbly rise today to pay tribute to \nSGT Clifton Yazzie. Sadly, this outstanding and brave young man was \nkilled in Hawijah, Iraq, on January 20, 2006.\n  As a cross-country runner and basketball player in high school, SGT \nYazzie was not known for his innate athletic ability. Instead, his \ncoaches and teammates remember him as a consummate team player who \nworked to improve his skills in every practice and every game. He \nenlisted after the\n\n[[Page S111]]\n\nterrible attacks of September 11, 2001, fully knowing that his country \nwould soon be going to war abroad. His quiet demeanor and steadfast \nservice is at the core of what the American military service is about: \nhonor, duty, humility, and loyalty.\n  His wife Michelle, children Chaynitta and Cayden, and parents \nClifford and Jeanette will be in all of our thoughts. He and Michelle, \nwho met at a high school dance, had been planning to renew their vows \nthis spring.\n  He was on his second tour of duty as an infantryman in the 1st \nBrigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division. We can never fully \nexpress our gratitude for our veterans' service; I ask that we stop now \nto honor Sergeant Yazzie and acknowledge his sacrifice, and that of his \nfamily and friends, for our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/25/senate-section/article/S111-1", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On October 4, 2002, Gwen Araujo was killed by three men in Hayward, \nCA. Araujo was beaten up, tied, and then strangled. The apparent \nmotivation for this crime was that Araujo was a transgendered teen.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that are born out of hate. The Local \nLaw Enforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. \nI believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/25/senate-section/article/S111-2", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, earlier this week, our Nation celebrated \nMartin Luther King Day. The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., would \nhave been 77 years old on January 16. It was a day to reflect on the \nlife of a man admired for the dream he dreamed for America, and for his \nwords and deeds in pursuit of it.\n  He dreamed, as he famously said, ``that one day this nation will rise \nup and live out the true meaning of its creed: `We hold these truths to \nbe self-evident: that all men are created equal.' '' Dr. King argued, \nin words that stir the heart, that racial segregation must end in the \nSouth and that Black Americans must be granted their citizenship rights \nthroughout the land and throughout our institutions: in education, in \nemployment, in housing, and in the voting booth.\n  His role in the push for full voting rights for African Americans is \nwell known but bears repeating. In the spring of 1965, a national \ntelevision audience was shocked by broadcasts of State troopers and \nsheriff's deputies brutally repulsing voting rights protesters in \nSelma, AL. Hours later, Dr. King declared: ``No American is without \nresponsibility.'' He went to Alabama and led a march, under Federal \nprotection, from Selma to the State capital. The event garnered \nnational support and provided momentum for congressional passage of the \nVoting Rights Act later that year.\n  Dr. King appreciated the blessings of freedom; he wanted them for his \npeople, and for all people. We remember this Protestant minister's \neloquence and also his sense of spiritual mission--he was an ecumenical \nreligious leader who brought people of all faiths, all races, together \nin mutual respect for one another.\n  As Taylor Branch, his biographer, put it: ``His oratory fused the \npolitical promise of equal votes with the spiritual doctrine of equal \nsouls.''\n  His belief in nonviolent protest convinced those who listened to him \nthat here was the high road to vindicating the rights of Black people \nin this country. It is a bitter fact that he lost his life to \nviolence--he was only 39 when an assassin's bullet cut him down in \nMemphis--and it makes us understand his great courage in taking on the \nburden of leadership.\n  In officially celebrating the life of Dr. King, we celebrate the end \nof legal segregation and the many inroads we have made against racism \nand discrimination. Of course, there is more we must do to make sure \nall Americans enjoy the blessings of freedom. He would tell us that, if \nhe were here. He would also insist that we continue on in his way: with \npassion and with civility, calling on our fellow human beings to act on \ntheir best instincts, not their worst.\n  Dr. King, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, is a model here and \naround the world--from China, and the 1989 antigovernment protests in \nTiananmen Square, to South Africa, where apartheid rule gave way in \n1990 without provoking the civil war many had feared. In encouraging \nthe holding of free elections and the formation of institutions of \ncivil society in faraway places today, we promote the idea that Martin \nLuther King put forward so well: that the nonviolent settling of \ndifferences among men is the bedrock of democracy.\n  Let us all take inspiration from the King legacy this week, Mr. \nPresident, and every week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/25/senate-section/article/S111-3", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S111-S112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT IMPLEMENTATION\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, on January 1, 2006, the administration \nlaunched the Medicare prescription drug benefit, a program long touted \nby President Bush as the vehicle that would provide affordable, easily \naccessed prescription drugs for seniors. The program has fallen far \nshort of that goal so far. The outcries that I have heard from \npharmacists, beneficiaries, and health care providers over the past few \nweeks make clear that the implementation of the program has been a \ndisaster. This program has not provided either affordable or easily \naccessed drugs to many Medicare beneficiaries. Instead, it has \npresented many seniors and the disabled with frustration, confusion, \nexpensive medications, and sometimes no medications at all. It is \nunacceptable for individuals to go without lifesaving medications, yet \nthis is what has been happening across the country since this program \ncommenced. This situation is an emergency, and Congress needs to \naddress it right away.\n  Since the beginning of January, I have received panicked phone calls \nfrom people in my State saying that they were unable to receive drugs \nthat they have been routinely getting at their pharmacy every other \nmonth. Many calls were from people who could not receive essential \ndrugs such as insulin, antipsychotics, or immunosuppressants for \ntransplant patients. At the same time as I was hearing from people \nsuffering from pain because they did not receive their pain \nmedications, I received press releases from the Centers for Medicare \nand Medicaid that expressed satisfaction with the launch of the program \nand boasted of the millions of participants in the program. There may \nbe millions participating in the program, but too many of them cannot \nreceive their drugs, and too many pharmacists are unable to comply with \nthe complicated regulations in the program. CMS should be focusing its \nefforts on addressing this emergency rather than disseminating public \nrelations messages.\n  All anyone needs to do is visit their local pharmacy in order to see \nthe problems with the benefit firsthand. There, they are likely to see \nharried pharmacists on the phone with Medicare or private drug plans. \nChances are high that they are on hold. There are often long waiting \nlines of people in need of medications, sometimes in desperate need, \nand there are customers being charged incorrectly for their \nprescriptions. Sometimes they are charged so much that they cannot \nafford it because the costs exceed what they have in the bank or what \ntheir credit limits will allow. Tragically, many of the most vulnerable \nbeneficiaries have been forced to walk out of the pharmacies without \ntheir drugs.\n  It is clear that, in many respects, the plan and the contingency \nplans for implementation have failed. For instance, the drug plan \nautomatically enrolled millions of individuals eligible for both \nMedicare and Medicaid into drug plans, and although these individuals \nwere supposed to be notified of this, many were not. Imagine the \nsurprise when\n\n[[Page S112]]\n\nthese people visited the pharmacy this month thinking that they would \nreceive their medications for the same price they paid in December. \nSome of these dually eligible individuals were victims of data glitches \nthat resulted in the pharmacists being unable to verify enrollment in \nany insurance, and they were told to pay for the full costs of their \ndrugs. Some were charged the wrong amount even though their insurance \nwas verified. These bills reached into the thousands of dollars at \ntimes. I was disheartened to learn that some of the beneficiaries paid \nfor the drugs on their credit cards, their only other option being to \ngo without their medications. Those with little income will be paying \nfor these drugs for months, with interest, and this is a sad burden for \nthe Federal Government to place on the neediest in society.\n  While my office did its utmost to help those who called, I wonder how \nmany Wisconsinites did not call my office, did not have relatives to \nhelp them, or were unable to get through to the help lines that had \nwaiting times of up to 5 days. How many people are being forced into \nemergency rooms in order to get their medications? How many people are \nbeing injured because of lack of medications? Have any deaths occurred \nas a result of the extraordinary bureaucratic hurdles in this program? \nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services needs to find answers to \nthese questions and address this crisis immediately.\n  Fortunately, many State governments, including Wisconsin's, came to \nthe aid of the public when the Federal Government would not by enacting \nemergency provisions. Now, these States are depending on the Federal \nGovernment to return the favor and reimburse them for funds that were \nspent out of tight State budgets. To date, the administration has \nrefused to compensate States. I will work to try to make sure that \nCongress quickly addresses this problem, passes legislation, and \nreimburses the States.\n  The health of our Nation's citizens is not a partisan issue, and we \nall must join together to assist the most needy. I voted against this \nprogram in 2003 and have since made numerous attempts to try to improve \nthe program. Since mid-December, I have sent three letters to the \nadministration, urging that the most pressing problems with the \nMedicare drug benefit be addressed. While these efforts were not \nsupported by Republicans, I want to make new efforts that I hope the \nother side of the aisle will support. We cannot sustain a great nation \nif we do not care for the elderly, the sick, the disabled, and the \nhomebound. These are the populations that this drug plan is supposed to \nbe serving, and I fear that they have been dismally let down the past \nfew weeks. Let us not wait any longer. Congress is in session, we are \nin a position to come to their aid, and I hope that we will do the \nright thing and quickly bring relief to the suffering.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/25/senate-section/article/S112-1", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SALMON RECOVERY\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today, as you may know, Jim Connaughton, \nchairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, called \nfor a comprehensive and collaborative approach to salmon recovery in \nthe Pacific Northwest. While I may not agree completely with Chairman \nConnaughton's statement, we must stop ignoring what is going on. It is \nabout time that someone speaks out about the reality of the situation \nin the Northwest in regards to salmon recovery. He proposed to end \noutdated hatchery programs and to stop harvest levels and practices \nthat impede recovery of salmon listed under the Endangered Species Act, \nESA. He also outlined a comprehensive collaborative process to promote \na shared goal and responsibility of salmon recovery. As early as next \nweek, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's fisheries \nservice, NOAA Fisheries, will launch a collaborative review of how \nharvest and hatcheries are affecting the recovery of ESA-listed salmon \nand steelhead.\n  There has been no clear direction in the past, and CEQ is taking the \nfirst step to provide a meaningful direction. We have sat back and idly \nwatched while the region moved from injunction to injunction and \nlawsuit to lawsuit. In fact, over the past 2 years, two injunctions \nhave been ordered and more lawsuits are being filed. This situation \njust fosters mistrust and the inability to meet common goals and \nobjectives.\n  Our past practices have focused on keeping the fish in the river and \nin abundant numbers so that we can have our cake and eat it, too. In no \nother place in the world do we treat an ESA-listed species this way. We \ndon't raise bald eagles only to use their feathers for our clothes, so \nwhy do we spend hundreds of millions of dollars--each year--to recover \nthe species, and then allow a majority of them to be killed through \nharvesting? The people who pay for these absurd practices are the \nNorthwest ratepayers.\n  Here are some facts that the region should know. The total cost of \nfish mitigation in the Northwest from 1978 to 2005 has been \napproximately $7 billion. Fish costs now make up to 30 percent of the \nBonneville Power Administration's power rates, 30 cents of every dollar \npaid for BPA-managed power. Snake River Fall Chinook are the most \nimpacted ESA-listed species in the Columbia River system. These fish \ndrive BPA's fish and wildlife program. Approximately 40 percent to 60 \npercent of this species is harvested.\n  Last summer, Judge Redden ordered a change in river operations that \nresulted in an approximately $75 million dollar hit to the region's \nratepayers. This means that depending on how many fish survive, summer \nspill costs between $225,000 and $3 million per fish, and consequently, \nratepayers are left with the bill. Even at $225,000 per fish, that is a \nlot of money. Judge Redden, once again, second-guessed the region's \nfish managers and made the decision to increase spill this spring and \nsummer. This will result in another cost to the ratepayers of \napproximately $60 million dollars.\n  Management of the river by the courts is not management at all. I \nwould like to help the management agencies--the appropriate managers of \nthe river system--to succeed in their efforts to manage the river, in \npartnership with local, State, and tribal governments.\n  Why not trust the experts who have the scientific knowledge to make \nthose decisions and help empower the region to work together instead of \ngiving up and having the court systems make management decisions? How \nare we to succeed in the future if we keep allowing others to make our \ndecisions for us?\n  When will this silliness stop? When will the region take ownership \nand responsibility for the river? And when will we work together as a \nregion and get serious about salmon recovery? CEQ made the first step \ntoday.\n  I will work with other Members of Congress to finally face these \nchallenges and to help provide direction and be more accountable to the \npublic and to recovery of the species. If we are serious about \nrecovery, we need to start acting serious and not avoid the tough \nquestions.\n  I would like to challenge my colleagues to come together in a \nbipartisan way to help the region get back on track.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/25/senate-section/article/S112-2", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S112-S113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my profound \ngratitude and heartfelt best wishes to a dear friend and dedicated \nAmerican, William B. Bonvillian, who has served as my legislative \ndirector and chief counsel since I first took office in the U.S. Senate \nin January 1989. It is truly a bittersweet occasion to bid farewell \nthis week to an outstanding and valued staff member with whom I have \nworked for 17 years in this hallowed institution that we both dearly \ncherish and respect. I can only say that, as Bill embarks on his new \nventure as director of federal relations for the Massachusetts \nInstitute of Technology, MIT, my loss is most surely MIT's gain.\n  Bill came to my Senate office as an accomplished and respected \nattorney who had previously served in the executive branch from 1977-\n1980 as Deputy Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Department of \nTransportation, where he was involved in major legislation relating to \ntransportation deregulation and funding issues. However, our long \nassociation actually goes back much further than that, to the early \n1970s. Bill was my first intern when I was elected to the State Senate; \nwe rode from New Haven to the State Capitol in Hartford\n\n[[Page S113]]\n\nin my old copper-colored Pinto several times a week after his classes \nat Yale Divinity School. Later, I hired him for a summer position with \nour State Senate committee investigating State construction issues. \nAfter I was elected to my first term here in the U.S. Senate, I sought \nto rehire Bill, who was by then a partner at a national law firm \nworking on corporate, real estate, transportation, and administrative \nlaw matters. I was beyond delighted when Bill agreed to leave his \npartnership to reenter public service.\n  Bill's record of service in the U.S. Senate has been one of enormous \ndistinction. When I look back with pride on the many legislative \ninitiatives I undertook with Bill's advice and assistance, I recall \nwith great admiration his determination, tenacity, and passionate \ninvolvement in crafting legislation. He built a stellar reputation on \nboth sides of the aisle for his skill in nurturing innovative ideas and \nnegotiating and advancing measures through an often complex legislative \nprocess. Bill's intuitive skills and strong leadership abilities have \nhelped result in the successful passage of many crucial policy \ninitiatives for which I have fought. Bill has played a key role in \nformulating and enacting vitally important legislative policy in the \nareas of science and technology; economic growth; innovation, research, \nand development in the fields of defense, manufacturing, health, and \nbioterrorism protection programs; and ensuring America's global \ncompetitiveness.\n  In addition, Bill's extensive and tireless work has resulted in many \nother significant legislative victories in our years together, \nincluding those pertaining to environmental and wilderness protection; \nenergy security; defense and foreign policy; health and social welfare; \ncampaign finance reform; media safeguards for children; education; and \ntransportation and our Nation's infrastructure. Bill also had a firm \nhand in the landmark law that led to the creation of the U.S. \nDepartment of Homeland Security and new intelligence reform initiatives \nto ensure the protection of our citizens. His ability to forge a \nconsensus on these and countless other complex issues is unequaled. \nBill's influence has been felt throughout the halls of Congress, and he \nhas left a great legacy here.\n  I would like to highlight key legislation, grouped by subject area, \non which Bill and his legislative team have assisted me over the years. \nI note that many of these bills or parts of them have gone on to become \nlaws:\n  Economic Growth--National Innovation Act, S. 2109 (2005); National \nNanotechnology R Act, P.L. 108-153 (2003); R Doubling Act, S. 2046 \n(2000) and predecessor bill, S. 1305 (1997); Individual Development \nAccounts, S. 2023 (2000); Enterprise Zone Act, S. 1032 (1991)\n  Defense, Homeland Security, and Foreign Policy--Rebuild the Army \n(increasing Army end-strength), S. 1397 (2005); Intelligence Reform \nAct, P.L. 108-458 (2004); 9/11 Commission Act, P.L. 107-306; Homeland \nSecurity Department Authorization, S. 2452 (2002); Establishment of the \nQuadrennial Defense Review, S. Amdt. 4156 to S. 1745 (1996); Bosnia \nIntervention, S.J. Res. 44 (1995); Gulf War Resolution, H.R. 2100 \n(1991)\n  Environment, Conservation, and Energy Security--Vehicle and Fuel \nChoices for America Act, S. 2025 (2005); Climate Change Act, S. 1151 \n(2005) and prior climate bills dating back to 1991; Clean Air Act of \n1990, S. 1630 (1990); Conte Connecticut River National Fish and \nWildlife Refuge Act, S. 821 (1991); Weir Farm National Historic Site, \nS. 2059 (1990)\n  Health and Social Programs--American Center for Cures, S. 2104 \n(2005); Bioshield II, S. 975 (2005)\n  Education--Technology Talent, S. 1549 (2001); 3R Act (No Child Left \nBehind), S. 303 (2001); Federal Charter School Assistance, S. 1513 \n(1994)\n  Media and Values--Parental Choice in Television Act (V-Chip), S. 632 \n(1995)\n  Government Reform--e-Government Act, S. 803 (2001); Congressional \nAccountability Act, S. 2071 (1994)\n  Transportation--Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act \n(ISTEA), P.L. 102-240 (1992).\n  We have been extremely fortunate to work with a person of Bill's \ncharacter and caliber. He has graciously shared his wealth of knowledge \nand wise counsel with legislative aides, fellows, and other staff \nmembers. He helped us form our innovative Legislative Fellows Program, \nin particular, which has helped us build a strong, substantive, policy- \nand idea-oriented office. Under Bill's leadership as legislative \ndirector, I have consistently had a professional staff of which I am \nvery proud. I think it is the equal of any on Capitol Hill.\n  Somehow, despite the long hours his work has involved, Bill finds the \ntime to nurture his abiding interest in an array of subjects, from art \nto history, and this is part of what makes Bill so very interesting to \nbe around. On many occasions, Bill led our new staffers and fellows on \nunique, memorable tours of the Capitol, where he regaled us with his \nvast knowledge of the Capitol's architecture, art collections, and \nhistorical vignettes of Congress and our democracy.\n  And now to add to these many accomplishments, Bill has an exciting \nopportunity to focus his efforts on science and technology innovation \nand policy, issues of deep concern to him and of critical importance to \nour Nation and the world. I have no doubt that Bill will distinguish \nhimself in this endeavor just as he has throughout his Senate career.\n  I sincerely thank Bill's wife, Janis Ann Sposato, for her \nunderstanding of the long hours and enormously demanding schedule so \noften posed by the Senate legislative calendar, even as they juggled \nthe demands of parenting and their public service careers. It has been \na pleasure to see Janis and Bill's sons, Raphael and Marcus, grow from \nchildhood into the fine young men they are today.\n  It has been a memorable journey. Through it all, Bill has maintained \nhis clear vision of a better future for all, a sense of humor, and calm \ndemeanor in the eye of any approaching storm. In all of his \ninteractions with staff, visiting constituents, and other parties with \nwhom he has come in contact, he has always given generously of his time \nand talent. I could not have made a better choice for my legislative \ndirector than I did in 1989 when I asked Bill to take on the challenges \nwe have faced together.\n  I am proud to call Bill a trusted adviser and lifelong friend. The \noffice will be a different place without him. My staff and I will miss \nhim a great deal, but we wish him success, health, and happiness \nalways. I sincerely thank and congratulate Bill Bonvillian on his \noutstanding, loyal, and dedicated service to the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/25/senate-section/article/S113-1", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S113-S114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ROGER WILLIAMS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President. I rise today to pay special tribute to \nAmerica's pre-eminent, piano-playing patriot, Mr. Roger Williams. Roger \nis to American music what the Grand Canyon is to the American \nlandscape.\n  Roger has enjoyed decades of success and the title ``Pianist to the \nPresidents,'' because he has had the honor to perform for eight of our \nNation's Commanders In Chief. In 2004, Roger celebrated his birthday \nalongside Jimmy Carter because the two share the exact same birth date.\n  Despite his advancing years, Roger's ivory-tickling fingers continue \nto thrill audiences. In November, he broke his own record for marathon \npiano-playing with a 14-hour performance at Steinway Hall in New York \nCity. The marathon was to raise awareness of the importance of music \neducation and to commemorate the 50th anniversary of his classic, \n``Autumn Leaves.'' This song is the only piano instrumental that has \never reached No. 1 on the Billboard singles charts.\n  According to Billboard Magazine, Roger is the greatest-selling \npianist of all time, with 18 Gold and Platinum albums to his credit. He \nis the first pianist to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, \nand is--so far--the only recipient of the Steinway Lifetime Achievement \nAward. Williams has played the music for soundtracks to films of three \ngenerations and in 2004 he released his 116th album. His records ``Born \nFree,'' ``The Impossible Dream,'' ``Almost Paradise,'' and the theme \nfrom ``Somewhere in Time'' are only some of his hits, which span 4 \ndecades.\n  Not only a virtuoso, Roger is also a man of great virtue. He is a \nchampion of music education in all schools and California Governor \nArnold Schwarzenegger named him ``Champion for Youth 2004.'' Roger \nregularly\n\n[[Page S114]]\n\ndonates his time and talent to charitable efforts and non-profit \norganizations, including spots on the televised ``Hour of Power'' \nministry since 1974.\n  I am grateful that I had the privilege of friendship with Roger \nWilliams. He is a great man, a superlative musician, and a true \nAmerican. As a musician myself, albeit one who is fairly low on the \npecking order, I commend Roger for his talent, hard work, and \ndedication to his craft. His music will continue to bless the lives of \nliterally millions for generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/25/senate-section/article/S114-1", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO PAUL MICHAEL WARNER\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a wonderful \nman, brilliant lawyer, and dedicated public servant--Mr. Paul Michael \nWarner. Paul has been serving as the United States Attorney for the \nDistrict of Utah for almost 8 years, and will be stepping down this \nweek to continue his work in other capacities within the legal system. \nAs he embarks on a new chapter of life, I wanted to take this \nopportunity to honor him for the leadership he has provided, and \ncommend him for his dedication to our country's legal system.\n  Paul was nominated by President Bill Clinton on July 29, 1998 to be \nthe United States Attorney for Utah. He was unanimously confirmed by \nthe United States Senate just one month later and by the end of August \nhe had assumed the full duties of this important position. After \nPresident George W. Bush took office, he recognized the tremendous \nleadership Mr. Warner was providing and reappointed him to this \nposition. He was then reconfirmed once again by the United States \nSenate and has continued to serve with strength and honor.\n  Prior to being appointed United States Attorney, Paul first joined \nthis office in 1989 and has served in various positions including: \nFirst Assistant United States Attorney, interim U.S. Attorney, Violent \nand Hate Crimes Coordinator, and the Chief of the Criminal Division. \nFor 7 years before joining the U.S. Attorney's Office, he worked in the \nUtah Attorney General's Office as the Chief of the Litigation Division \nand as an Associate Chief Deputy to the Attorney General.\n  Throughout his many years of service within the criminal justice \nsystem, Paul has established himself as an effective leader in the \nfight against crime. He has always greatly valued cohesive working \nrelationships with Federal, State, and local law enforcement personnel. \nI believe that without exception, he has become a highly respected and \ntrusted prosecutor and able administrator.\n  While serving in the Bush Administration, Paul was appointed the \nChairman of U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft's Advisory Committee of \nU.S. Attorneys. He also previously chaired the Subcommittee on \nTerrorism for this Committee, and continues as an ex-officio member of \nthe Committee to this day.\n  Paul's legal career began when he graduated with the first class of \nthe J. Reuben Clark Law School at Brigham Young University--BYU--in \n1976. He later went on to receive a masters' degree in public \nadministration from the Marriott School of Management at BYU.\n  Following graduation from law school, Paul served 6 years as a trial \nlawyer in the Judge Advocate General Corps of the United States Navy. \nIn 1983, he enlisted with the Utah Army National Guard, Judge Advocate \nBranch, where he rose to the rank of Colonel. He is currently serving \nas the State Staff Judge Advocate, supervising a staff of 17 attorneys. \nHe is also the past president of the Utah National Guard Association. \nThe leadership and work he has provided to the military has been \ninvaluable as he has worked on cases not only important to our Nation, \nbut to the men and women who fight to preserve our freedoms.\n  Paul has also been involved in many professional organizations \nincluding serving as a Master of the Bench in the American Inns of \nCourt, and Chairman of the Board of Visitors for the BYU Law School. He \nhas also been honored by numerous military and civilian organizations \nwith awards including: the United States Army's Meritorious Service \nMedal with two oak leaf clusters, the 2004 Honored Alumni of the Year \nfor the BYU Law School, the Utah State Bar's 2004 Dorothy Merrill \nBrothers Award for the Advancement of Women in the Legal Profession, \nthe Federal Bar Association's Distinguished Service Award for 2003, and \nthe NAACP's 2002 Community Relations Award for Civil Rights.\n  Throughout my years of working with Paul I have always been impressed \nwith his utmost integrity and honesty. He has a strong desire to do \nwhat is right. He has garnered the respect and admiration of the staff \nhe has led, and has served as a mentor and friend to many future \nleaders in Utah's legal community. He diligently strives to treat all \nparties with dignity and fairness, and his work has been an example of \nhis commitment to individual rights and the rule of law.\n  His work within the legal community has been lauded, but perhaps his \nmost important accomplishments have occurred within his family and \nneighborhood. Paul is a devoted husband to Linda, and wonderful father \nto four children. He has been a friend to many from all walks of life, \nand all persuasions. His work has been an outstanding example of \nsomeone who has dedicated his life to helping others while upholding \nthe principles and ideals embodied in the foundation of our country the \nConstitution.\n  I am grateful for the service Paul Warner has rendered throughout his \nyears of public service--but most importantly as the United States \nAttorney for Utah. He is a truly dedicated public servant, strong \nleader, and special friend. I want to wish him well as he travels new \npathways in life. I know that he will continue to guide and enrich the \nlives of those who have the privilege of working with him; and will \nremain steadfast in his commitment to enhancing and furthering the \nimportant work of our judicial system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/25/senate-section/article/S114-2", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S114-S115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO W. CLEON SKOUSEN\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President. I rise today to pay special tribute to a \nman I deeply admire, W. Cleon Skousen. Cleon was a giant of a man. He \nwas an exceptionally bright scholar; a wonderful husband, father, and \ngrandfather; a special friend; and a true patriot in every sense of the \nword.\n  Sadly, Cleon recently passed away leaving a tremendous void in the \nlives of all who knew him. Cleon played a significant role in the \npolitical and governmental arena throughout Utah, our Nation, and even \nthe world. I can state without any equivocation today that Cleon loved \nAmerica. He truly loved our country and its citizens. He deeply \nrespected our Founding Fathers, and he had the utmost reverence for the \ndocument that is the basis of all of our freedoms--our Constitution.\n  When I first met Cleon, I was a young, enthusiastic, go-getter who \nwanted to make a difference in our Nation's Capitol. Shortly before I \nannounced that I would be running for the U.S. Senate in 1976 as a \npolitical novice and virtually unknown candidate--Cleon was one of the \nfirst people of political significance and substance who agreed to meet \nwith me and discuss my candidacy.\n  A few short years before this time, Cleon had organized a nonprofit \neducational foundation named ``The Freemen Institute,'' to foster \n``constitutionalist'' principles including a drastic reduction in the \nsize and scope of the Federal Government, and a reverence for the true, \nunchanging nature of our Constitution. I knew that he had strongly held \nbeliefs and I was very interested in what he had to say.\n  We found in each other at that first meeting many areas of common \nground and a shared love for the principles that make America the \nstrongest bastion of freedom on Earth. Cleon quickly agreed to help, \nand throughout the coming months he became a true champion of my \ncandidacy. He sent a letter to 8,000 of his ``friends'' stating that I \nwas running for the Senate ``for the express purpose of waging a fight \nto restore constitutional principles in this country.'' I was humbled \nby his support, and I felt a true need to fulfill his expectations of \nme and to never let him down.\n  From that first campaign, to every day I have served in the U.S. \nSenate--Cleon has been there for me, through highs and lows--buoying me \nup, giving suggestions, discussing principles and issues, and above all \nelse being a true,\n\n[[Page S115]]\n\nsupportive friend. I can never overstate what his support has meant to \nme throughout my years of service.\n  A natural outgrowth of the successful Freemen Institute was the \nfounding of the National Center for Constitutional Studies which Cleon \nstarted to further the study of our Founding Fathers and the U.S. \nConstitution. He traveled the globe and spoke to literally hundreds of \nthousands of people each year for many years to promote the ideals of \nthis center.\n  The mission of the center was so aptly described by our Nation's \nfirst President, George Washington, when he said: ``A primary object. . \n. should be the education of our youth in the science of government. In \na republic, what species of knowledge can be equally important? And \nwhat duty more pressing than communicating it to those who are to be \nthe future guardians of the liberties of the country?''\n  Cleon took this mission very seriously and spent many hours each week \neducating and imparting his knowledge of his years of study to people \nthroughout our Nation, and even the world. He cultivated friendships \nfar and wide and became to many the ``Master Teacher.''\n  As we all know, Cleon was a prolific author and writer. His books, \n``The First 2000 Years, The Making of America,'' and ``The Five \nThousand Year Leap'' have been used by foundations, and in forums \nacross America for many years. His writings and words leave an \nindelible legacy of knowledge and beliefs that have touched many people \nand will continue to inspire and educate generations to come.\n  Many have yearned for even a morsel of his years of study. He was \nlearning, studying and writing until the end. I loved an account I \nrecently read in the Deseret News from the Rev. Donald Sills, a Baptist \nminister who became close friends over many years with Cleon. He spoke \nof his knowledge and study and recalled a time when he found Cleon \nsitting on the steps of the Jefferson Memorial in Washington, DC. When \nhe asked Cleon what he was doing just sitting there, Cleon's fitting \nresponse was, ``I'm talking to Tom Jefferson.''\n  Cleon had a strong desire for good government, and a true love for \nour Savior Jesus Christ and our Heavenly Father. He believed that our \ncountry was founded on pure principles and that our Heavenly Father had \na hand in guiding our historic and profound beginnings. He firmly \nbelieved, as many believe, that God governs the affairs of men. He was \nnot shy about sharing this belief with all who would listen. The words \nhe shared on this subject were not unlike the words spoken by Benjamin \nFranklin as he arose on the floor to speak at a particularly trying \ntime during the Constitutional Convention. He pled with his peers to \ncall upon the Father of them all for wisdom and guidance as they \ncontinued to contemplate and draft this most important document.\n  His words remind me so richly of Cleon when Mr. Franklin stated: ``I \nhave lived, Sir, a long time; and the longer I live, the more \nconvincing proofs I see of this truth, that God governs in the affairs \nof men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice, \nis it probable that an empire can rise without his aid? We have been \nassured, Sir, in the sacred writings that `except the Lord build the \nhouse, they labor in vain that build it,' I firmly believe this. . .''\n  And Cleon firmly believed it. He had a true testimony of our Savior's \nworks and our Father's infinite wisdom and love. He wrote of it. He \ntestified of it. And he lived a life following their teachings.\n  The wonderful, strong leader General George S. Patton once said: ``It \nis foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died. Rather we should thank \nGod that such men lived.''\n  I don't believe it is foolish to mourn the loss of this great man--\nbut I do thank my Heavenly Father that W. Cleon Skousen lived, and that \nhe touched my life in so many ways. His example, passionate beliefs, \nand wonderful mind will never be forgotten. His journey was full and \nbrought rich rewards to people throughout the world.\n  I am grateful that I had the privilege of knowing W. Cleon Skousen \nand working with him.

Mr. President, today it is an honor and a privilege to \nrise and congratulate the men and women of L-3's Communication Systems-\nWest on the 50th anniversary of that company's arrival in Utah.\n  I realize that many outside of the state of Utah might not have heard \nof L-3's Communication Systems-West, but no one can dispute the \nstrategic advantages that this company has provided to our Nation's men \nand women in uniform. Much of the work that Communication Systems-West \nperforms is of a highly classified nature. However, I can say that the \nreal-time, world-wide dissemination of images and information gathered \nby the U-2 and our new unmanned aerial vehicles, such as Global Hawk \nand the Predator, is only possible because of the hard work by the \npeople at Communication Systems-West. For example in 2001, \nCommunication Systems-West was awarded the Collier Award for producing \nthe airborne integrated communications system for the Global Hawk. As \nmy colleagues may know, the Collier Trophy is the National Aeronautic \nAssociations' highest honor for that year's greatest American \naeronautical achievement.\n  Other examples of Communication Systems-West outstanding work can be \nfound in the SATCOM Tri-Band Satellite Earth Terminals and the ROVER \nIII Remote Operations Video Enhanced Receiver system that are deployed \nwith our forces today. As a stalwart division for L-3, the employees of \nCommunication Systems-West were honored in 2005 to receive the L-3 \nChairman's Award for Best Operating Performance.\n  It is not an exaggeration to say that the technologies created and \nbuilt by Communication Systems-West have won battles for the United \nStates and, equally as important, saved countless American lives.\n  However, the leadership of Communication Systems-West's 2,300 \nemployees, including 1,000 engineers, is not limited to the \nbattlefield. It is also found in their dedication to their community. \nCommunication Systems-West partners with Utah's universities to assist \nin placing new graduates in promising and creative careers. The company \nis an active member of the Mathematics, Engineering, and Science \nAchievement, or MESA, consortium. MESA, of course, provides resources \nto aid minority and female students entering technological fields of \nstudy. As a contributor to the Ames and Challenger advanced education \nprograms for high school students interested in technology sciences, \nCommunication Systems-West continues to bring a bright future to the \nnext generation of students.\n  Finally, Communication Systems-West also supports it home-town \nNational Guardsmen and Reservists by fully paying the salaries of its \nemployees who have been activated to fight the War on Terrorism.\n  Communication Systems-West and its employees have been an integral \npart of Utah for a half-century, and we\n\n[[Page S116]]\n\nall are immensely proud of the contributions they have made to our \ncountry and our State. I congratulate them and wish them 50 more years \nof success and prosperity in the great State of Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/25/senate-section/article/S116-1", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                CONCEPT2\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, like most Americans, I start off the year \nwith my new year's resolution to work harder at getting in shape. As \nalways, my first stop is the Concept2 rowing machine in the Senate gym. \nI have used it for years, and always think of Vermont when I do.\n  The rowing machines are made in Vermont, and last fall the Burlington \nFree Press had an excellent article about the company and its founders. \nI ask that a copy of the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Free Press, Oct. 14, 2005]\n\n                             What a Concept\n\n                           (By Matt Crawford)\n\n       Morrisville.--Peter and Dick Dreissigacker will be on \n     Boston's Charles River next weekend, rowing their way toward \n     the finish line in the annual Head of the Charles regatta.\n       The Dreissigacker brothers are two members of an eight-man \n     team called the Motley Rowing Club--a team that captured \n     third place in its division during last year's race. If the \n     Motley team is beaten again, part of the blame can be placed \n     squarely on the broad shoulders of the Dreissigackers.\n       What Nike is to running, what Orvis is to fly-fishing, what \n     Burton is to snowboarding, Concept2 is to rowing. Concept2 is \n     a Morrisville-based company that employs 55 people, and it is \n     run and owned by Misters Peter and Dick Dreissigacker. The \n     company leads the world in producing oars used by crews and \n     sculling teams and controls a significant portion of the \n     global indoor rowing machine market, too. ``Their products \n     are found around the world,'' said Alex Machi, director of \n     rowing at Middlebury College. ``They easily dominate the oar \n     manufacturing business.''\n       How two Connecticut brothers maneuvered their \n     internationally successful company into the center of the \n     rowing universe from a small town in northern Vermont is a \n     remarkable tale, one that continues to evolve on rivers and \n     ponds and indoor gyms around the world . . .\n       ``The challenge,'' said Peter, ``is trying to continue to \n     improve on what we've got.''\n       Dick Dreissigacker, now 58, was a member of the 1972 U.S. \n     Olympic Rowing Team and a Brown University product. He \n     drifted out to California to take a rowing coaching position \n     at Stanford, a school Peter, who's four years younger, was \n     attending.\n       Dick was looking for a ``secret weapon'' after the 1972 \n     Olympics and began to explore ways to improve oars, which had \n     been crafted out of wood pretty much since humans started \n     rowing boats through water. ``There were quite a few \n     companies making composite boats,'' said Peter, ``but nobody \n     was making oars.''\n       By 1976, the Dreissigackers had built a prototype of a \n     composite oar and began making them in the back of a bread \n     truck. They looked at places around the country and decided \n     to buy an old barn in Morrisville, partly because they were \n     from the Northeast, and started producing oars. By the 1980 \n     Olympics, composite oars--made of carbon fiber and epoxies \n     and glues--were standard, thanks to the work of the \n     Dreissigacker boys.\n       The company makes ``sweep'' oars, oars for sculling and \n     oars for a small niche of rowers who specialize in trans-\n     Atlantic crossings. Oars range in price from about $200 to \n     more than $400 each, and there are custom orders, blade and \n     shaft repairs and stylized custom painting jobs that keep the \n     company's employees busy. Dick says there are two other \n     companies that are viewed as competitors with the \n     Dreissigackers, but Concept2 controls about two-thirds of the \n     world's competitive oar market.\n       In 1991, the Dreissigackers struck again, changing the \n     shape of the oar blades to a bigger, ``hatchet'' style, a \n     change that exploded through the rowing scene. At the 1992 \n     Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, said Peter, ``boats were on the \n     water, changing their blades to our style.'' There was some \n     discussion of banning the bigger blade, which was more \n     efficient and more effective, but the style quickly became \n     the sport's standard. Two Middlebury teams and a University \n     of Vermont women's team will be using Concept2 oars when they \n     compete at the Head of the Charles next weekend. ``If 75 or \n     80 percent of the teams at the Head of the Charles are using \n     our oars,'' said Dick, ``then almost 100 percent of those \n     teams will have trained on our indoor trainers. They're \n     pretty much the standard.''\n       The Dreissigackers started making the indoor machines in \n     the mid-1980s, the first versions little more than bike \n     wheels and chains. Now the machines--their fourth version--\n     come equipped with computers to monitor an athlete's \n     performance and sell for $850. There are hundreds of them in \n     the Morrisville factory, stacked up and awaiting the start of \n     the Christmas buying season.\n       The first indoor rowing machines were called rowing \n     ergometers, or ``Ergs,'' for short, and the Dreissigackers \n     even developed a formula that allows the machines to measure \n     rowing ability--a number that the rowing world now refers to \n     as ``Erg scores.'' ``It's kind of like an athletic SAT \n     score,'' said Dick, who attributes Peter's higher Erg score \n     to the fact that he's four years younger, even though Dick \n     rows almost every day of the summer on a lake at his cottage \n     in Albany. There's a gym for Concept2 employees at the \n     company's headquarters, and yes, it is filled with rowing \n     machines. No longer in the barn, the company moved in 1984 to \n     a more industrial location, not far from the center of \n     Morrisville. The factory today is more than 45,000 square \n     feet.\n       Sarah Tousignant, a senior at the University of Vermont and \n     president of the school's women's rowing team, knows how \n     important Concept2's Erg machines are. The Catamounts train \n     six days a week on the Lamoille River using Dreissigacker \n     oars. They'll soon move inside for the winter and shift onto \n     Ergs. ``We just ordered 12 new Ergs from them,'' she said.\n       Most of the Head of the Charles athletes will be using \n     Dreissigacker oars, and nearly all will have trained and \n     honed their skills on Dreissigacker indoor machines. So even \n     if the Motley crew team gets beaten to the finish line on the \n     Charles River next weekend, the Dreissigackers still win. \n     With the Boston Red Sox out of baseball's playoffs, the eyes \n     of the sporting world turn to Boston this month for one \n     thing: The Head of the Charles Regatta.\n       A stretch? Consider that more than 7,000 athletes from \n     around the globe will compete in 24 race events in the 41st \n     annual Head of the Charles on Oct. 22-23. It is the world's \n     largest two-day rowing event. Rowing teams from the \n     University of Vermont and Middlebury College will be among \n     the competitors, as will brothers Dick and Pete Dreissigacker \n     from Morrisville.\n       The Dreissigackers, both former Olympics rowers, have been \n     competing in the Head of the Charles since 1978. In a way, \n     they'll be in the majority of boats on the river, given that \n     most of the competitors will be using oars made by the \n     Dreissigackers' Concept2 company. ``It's pretty much the most \n     prestigious fall race,'' said Sarah Tousignant, women's team \n     president of UVM rowing. ``It's the race that everybody looks \n     forward to and holds in high regard.'' The Head of the \n     Charles was first held Oct. 16, 1965. As many as 300,000 \n     spectators are expected to be on hand for the weekend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/25/senate-section/article/S116-2", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         CHINESE LUNAR NEW YEAR\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nrecognize the Chinese Lunar New Year. 2006 is the Year of the Dog.\n  The Chinese calendar is based on the cycles of the sun and the moon, \nand the Chinese Lunar New Year is the most important of Chinese \nfestivals. Celebration begins on the first day of the first moon of the \nlunar calendar and ends on the full moon 15 days later, with the \nLantern Festival. In order to prepare for the new year, families \nperform several rituals to cleanse the home and the spirit, to sweep \naway misfortune and to welcome in the new year with good luck, health, \nhappiness and prosperity.\n  The Chinese lunar calendar is associated with a 12-year animal \nzodiac. According to ancient Chinese legend, Buddha asked all the \nanimals to meet him on the Chinese Lunar New Year. Twelve animals came, \nand Buddha rewarded each animal by naming a year after each one. The 12 \nanimals--Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Sheep, Monkey, \nRooster, Dog and Pig--represent a cyclical concept of time. He told \neach animal that the people born in their year would inherit some of \nthe personality traits of that animal. It is said that those born in \nthe Year of the Dog tend to be loyal, kind, and generous.\n  America is rich with the cultural traditions of many countries. In \nCalifornia, the Chinese-American community plays a vibrant and \nimportant part of our State's history. Celebrating the Chinese Lunar \nNew Year allows us to embrace this significant and most important \ncultural festival of the Chinese calendar.\n  I hope that the Chinese Lunar New Year brings good health, happiness, \npeace and prosperity to all. I give my very best wishes for an \nauspicious New Year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/25/senate-section/article/S116-3", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S116-S117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TRIBUTE TO THE NORTHERN KENTUCKY UNIVERSITY CHEERLEADERS\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, today I rise to honor an \noutstanding group of young choir members who have brought joy and \nmusical harmony to countless people in Delaware and around the world.\n  The Cathedral Choir School of Delaware has been chosen to perform on \nJanuary 25, 2006, for an audience at the White House that will include \nFirst Lady Laura Bush. They will also be presented with the Coming Up \nTaller Award. This award is the Nation's highest honor for afterschool \nand out-of-school programs that use arts and humanities to enrich the \nlives of children. Created in 1998, this awards program is a project of \nthe President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities in partnership \nwith Institute of Museum and Library Services, the National Endowment \nfor the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.\n  Cathedral Choir School has had an enormous positive impact on the \nlives of the students who pass through its halls. The more than 50 \nstudents, ranging in age from 7 to 17, who attend the school are \nencouraged to learn the enduring values of discipline, responsibility, \nleadership and teamwork.\n  With more than 800 alumni since its inception in 1883, the Cathedral \nchoir school has had a positive impact on both the lives of the \nstudents who have had the privilege of participating in this choir \nschool and the lives of those around them. By training Delaware's young \npeople in life skills and community involvement, the Cathedral Choir \nSchool has consistently enhanced the lives of all that it touches.\n  I would like to acknowledge the hard work and dedication that the \npaid staff and volunteers of the Cathedral Choir School have \ndemonstrated over the years. Under the direction today of Dr. Darryl \nRoland, these dedicated men and women have helped the lives of \ncountless children. During his time of overseeing the Cathedral Choir \nSchool, Dr. Roland has served as a shining example of what is possible \nwhen good and caring adults decide to make a positive difference in the \nlives of children.\n  I would especially like to acknowledge the commitment and enthusiasm \nthat the individual members of the choir have shown during their time \nwith the choir. These outstanding young people have made a personal \ncommitment to themselves and to their communities to challenge \nthemselves and try their best to live up to the high standards of the \nCathedral Choir School. The rehearsals and afterschool music training \nare done with a sense of love for artistic expression. It takes a \nspecial type of person to share that gift with the rest of us.\n  The faculty and students of the Cathedral Choir School are to be \ncommended and applauded for their extraordinary efforts. Their \ndedication and love of music continues to serve as an example of what \nis possible when young people are given the opportunity to follow their \ndreams. All of Delaware is proud of them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/25/senate-section/article/S117-2", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING THE LIFE OF MAURICE GUERRY\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, this past December Idaho \nunexpectedly lost a generous and gracious man who will be missed \nterribly by all who had the pleasure of experiencing his welcoming \nspirit and warm heart.\n  Maurice was a sheep rancher from Three Creek, ID, who was known for \nhis ready smile, charm and unequivocal love for his wife, family and \nthe land on which he made his livelihood. I had the distinct privilege \nof working with him a number of times on collaborative land management \nendeavors and remember well that he made an extraordinary effort to get \nthose who thought themselves at odds to find common ground and work \ntogether. He saw the wisdom and value of this approach and was \nrespected for it.\n  With his sheep dog keeping a sharp eye from the back of his truck, \nMaurice diligently cared for his land and was known to carry candy with \nhim to share in case he met someone on one of the remote roads near his \nranch. He and his wife, Marlene, would put together a dinner party for \ndozens at the drop of a hat, welcoming strangers with open arms. He was \nespecially close to his fellow Basque friends.\n  Maurice had a soul of generosity, gentleness, and wisdom and knew the \nvalue of hard, honest work. This legacy is his gift and it lives on in \nhis family and friends. My prayers are with them during this difficult \ntime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/25/senate-section/article/S117-3", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DOUGLAS W. BOOK\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I was saddened to learn of the \nsudden passing of Forest City Chief of Police Douglas ``Doug'' Book on \nJanuary 13. Doug leaves behind a remarkable career in law enforcement \nthat spans over three decades. He has had an immense impact not only in \nhis community of Forest City but throughout the entire State of Iowa.\n  Doug Book began his career as a full-time patrolman in 1968 and \nquickly rose amongst the ranks of his department until he was appointed \nchief of police in 1973. He served faithfully in this capacity until \nhis passing. In addition to his dedicated service to his community, \nDoug also served Iowa as the head of the North Central Iowa Narcotics \nTask Force for the past 10 years. Doug also served as chairman of the \nIowa Law Enforcement Academy Board and as president of the Iowa \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police and Peace Officers.\n  Doug's constant support and guidance for his fellow officers did not \nstop at Iowa's borders but spilled over to other departments in New \nYork City. Chief Book joined a group of Iowa police officers as part of \na critical incident stress management team that helped New York City \npolice officers cope with the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist \nattacks.\n  One of Doug's colleagues described him simply as a ``good guy, a good \ncop, and a good friend.'' His friends and family should be very proud \nof what he has done for so many people. Chief Book's devotion, hard \nwork, and dedication to duty will be sorely missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/25/senate-section/article/S117-4", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S117-S118]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 40 YEARS OF EXEMPLARY FEDERAL SERVICE\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on February 3, 2006, Mr. Ray H. \nJyo, Deputy District Engineer for Programs and Project Management/\nChief, Programs and Project Management Division, Honolulu Engineer \nDistrict, HED, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, will retire from the \nGovernment following nearly 40 years of exemplary service to Hawaii, \nthe Pacific Region, the military and the Nation.\n  Born and raised in Hawaii, Mr. Jyo is a registered professional \nengineer and a member of the American Society of Military Engineers, \nwho served in numerous engineering and executive management positions \nin the U.S. Army. He holds a bachelor's of science degree in civil \nengineering from the University of Minnesota. He has attended the \nSenior Officials in National Security Program, the John F. Kennedy \nSchool of Government, Harvard University and the Emerging Issues in \nPublic Management Training at the Brookings Institute.\n  Over the course of his 40-year career, Mr. Jyo has served with pride \nand distinction. I have witnessed his steadfast dedication and hard \nwork to improve\n\n[[Page S118]]\n\nand safeguard the lives of our citizens and servicemembers.\n  Mr. Jyo has demonstrated the highest values and ideals in his many \naccomplishments throughout his distinguished Federal service. Upon \nretirement, he will have served the Federal Government for 39 years, 11 \nmonths and 13 days. He has succeeded at every job position in his \ncareer, which covers every facet of the design/construction/management \ncontinuum of the construction industry. He has used his considerable \nleadership and management skills on behalf of the Army Corps and the \nNation to achieve much success.\n  As the chief of the Far East Surveillance Branch from 1982 to 1986, \nMr. Jyo pioneered the regionalization concept at the Pacific Ocean \nDivision, POD. His program managers monitored engineering, design and \nconstruction efforts at the Japan and Far East Districts with the focus \nof providing valued-added service to the districts and our regional \npartners with the Army and Air Force. Mr. Jyo's branch became the \n``strike'' arm of POD's rapid deployment force which led and provided \nhands-on project management and technical assistance to the districts. \nHis teams would deploy to the districts to support them during times of \npeak workload or during crisis situations making them invaluable to \nDistrict operations. He also had the responsibility of keeping U.S. \nArmy, Pacific and Pacific Air Forces informed and involved in our large \nconstruction program overseas. Many of the principles and policies he \npioneered are still being followed at POD today. During this timeframe, \nMr. Jyo led by example when he deployed to Ft. Drum for 2 months to \nlead the planning and programming efforts to provide quality facilities \nfor the 10th Mountain Division.\n  During his tenure as the chief, Technical Engineering Division, 1986 \nto 1987, Mr. Jyo provided quality technical services to all the \ndistricts in POD. In addition, he instituted the concept of life-cycle \ntechnical services by sending his technical reviewers to the field to \nassist the construction offices in coming up with viable solutions to \nsticky construction problems. This formed the basis of the latter \nconsolidation of the technical review and quality assurance staffs at \nPOD. Responsive to the customer, Mr. Jyo has consistently strived to \nprovide high-quality technical services and products in a responsive \nmanner.\n  As the chief of Military Division, Mr. Jyo led the planning, \nengineering, and construction of the military program POD-wide. Through \nhis leadership and experience, POD has become the proven leader in \nproject execution and accomplishment.\n  As the acting director of Engineering and Construction Directorate, \nMr. Jyo forged a solid link between engineering, design, and \nconstruction quality. He brought all of POD's technical assets together \nto work toward common goals to provide responsive service and \nengineering and construction excellence to POD. The Engineering and \nConstruction Directorate was the largest directorate at POD and \nincluded the operational elements of design, construction, engineering \nservices, environmental, cost engineering as well as design and \nconstruction quality assurance. Mr. Jyo maintained technical excellence \nby pioneering innovative design and procurement tools, such as the \nconstruction indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity contracting for \nTripler Army Medical Center, later to be applied across the division \nprograms, and such technical tools as the Computer Aided Drafting and \nDesign, CADD, and Geographical Information Systems (GIS). By combining \nthe technical elements of design, engineering and construction quality \nassurance into one division, he unified the quality function and \ncreated ``life cycle'' accountability for a design/construction \ncontinuum. Mr. Jyo truly was an innovator and made POD a better \norganization.\n  Since 1997, Mr. Jyo has been the deputy district engineer for \nprograms and project management for the Honolulu District. He has \ncontinued to utilize his leadership skills to accomplish considerable \nsuccesses on their behalf. He has executed programs and projects in a \nteam-oriented matrixed organization. He has led the effort to \nincorporate a quality management system into the district along with \nInternational Organization for Standardization 9001 certification. He \nhas instituted a learning organization with a system of After Action \nReviews and Lessons-Learned. He is successfully leading the district \nthrough its biggest construction program with highly visible programs \nsuch as the Stryker Brigade Combat Team and C-17 implementation in \nHawaii. Under his leadership, the Honolulu District has achieved the \nhighest customer satisfaction rating in its history.\n  Mr. Jyo is a recognized representative of the Corps in the Pacific \nRegion. He has established lasting relationships with the Hawaii \nCongressional Delegation as well as the Governors of Guam and the \nCommonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands. Mr. Jyo's efforts have \nmade lasting impacts on the abilities of our service men and women to \nfight the global war on terror, bolster the region's economy while \nardently protecting the environment.\n  Mr. Jyo played an instrumental role in expanding the civil works and \ncapital improvement programs to Guam, American Samoa, Kwajalein, and \nthe Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. In addition, Mr. Jyo \noversaw the construction of the Alenaio Stream Flood Control project in \nHilo, HI, which was completed in 1997 at a cost of $16 million. During \nthe storm of November 2000, the improvements prevented approximately \n$13 million in damages and remains fully functional today.\n  Prominent projects on the island of Oahu include the construction and \nrenovation of military housing and improving facilities at Hickam AFB, \nWheeler, Schofield, Aliamanu, and Fort Shafter. In 1989, HED began the \ndesign of the $110 million Hale Koa--Phase 2 recreational hotel at Fort \nDeRussy in Waikiki. Upon its completion in 1994, the Fort DeRussy area \nwas transformed into a visually pleasing enhancement of Waikiki for the \nbenefit of the military and civilian communities.\n  His lifelong contributions and achievements to the Army are \nconsiderable. His recognized leadership and ability to forge lasting \nrelationships and his clear vision describes an outstanding individual \nwho has dedicated his life to public service. Ray Jyo's distinguished \ncareer may be coming to an end, but his loyalty to the goals of the \nArmy and the Nation will carry on. On behalf of a grateful Nation, \nthank you for your service and for a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/25/senate-section/article/S118-1", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S118]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO PAMELA ALTMEYER-ALVEY\n\n Mr. LUGAR.

Over the last 12 months, \nGleaners has distributed nearly 11 million pounds of food and other \ncritical grocery products to 400 hunger relief charities in 29 central \nIndiana counties. Since inception Gleaners has distributed over 173 \nmillion pounds of product to Hoosiers in their time of need.\n  I have had the joy of working closely with Mrs. Altmeyer and Gleaners \nFood Bank in procuring resources for needy Hoosiers. I believe that, \nboth as a Nation and as individuals, we can do more to improve the \nlives of those in need.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for an offset from the Medicaid clawback for State prescription \ndrug expenditures for covered part D drugs for Medicare beneficiaries; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the \nMedicare State Reimbursement Act along with my colleagues, Senators \nSnowe, Schumer, Coleman, Feinstein, Pryor, DeWine, Boxer, Menendez, \nCollins, Dayton, Reed, Jeffords, Lincoln, Leahy, Wyden, Stabenow, \nJohnson, Kennedy, Dorgan, Lieberman, Clinton, Chafee and Dodd.\n  There have been many difficulties surrounding implementation of the \nMedicare prescription drug benefit, however, few have experienced the \nseverity of the problems that those who are dually eligible for both \nMedicare and Medicaid have faced.\n  ``Dual Eligibles'' are the Nation's poorest seniors and the disabled. \nMany suffer from multiple, chronic, debilitating conditions and on \naverage take between five and ten medications per day. Missing even one \ndose of medication could result in a life threatening situation.\n  Across America, countless beneficiaries who tried to have their \nprescriptions filled for the first time under the new system were told \nthat their enrollment could not be verified, their drugs were not \ncovered, or they would be charged larger co-payments or deductibles \nthan they could afford. As a result, many were at risk of not receiving \nlifesaving prescription drugs.\n  Regardless of how Senators voted on the Medicare Drug bill, I think \nall Senators can agree on one thing: the flaws in the startup of this \nprogram are unacceptable.\n  Fortunately, a number of States including New Jersey have taken \nactions to help those who have experienced problems with access to \nmedications under the new prescription drug benefit. As of Wednesday \nthis week, New Jersey had already spent $16.6 million dollars.\n  Congress has been asking the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices whether New Jersey and other States will be paid back for its \nexpenditures. The answers we have gotten so far are not satisfactory.\n  That is why we need to legislate on this issue. It must be crystal \nclear to the Federal Government that it needs to repay these States \nthat are bailing them out.\n  Accordingly, I am introducing emergency legislation today that will \nreimburse States for the cost they have incurred for filling this \nunanticipated gap in coverage.\n  Specifically, this legislation would: require the Federal Government \nto reimburse the states for the cost of prescriptions for low income \nseniors and people with disabilities (``dual eligibles'') who were \neligible for coverage under Medicare Part D, but were improperly denied \nFederal coverage.\n  Reimburse states through an equivalent reduction in funds owed by \neach state under the ``claw back'' provision of the new Medicare law.\n  Reimbursement will be at a rate equal to 100 percent of all State \ncosts plus an interest rate equal to the market rate on 3-month \nTreasury Securities plus 0.1 percent.\n  Directs the Secretary of HHS to recover overpayments by states to \nprivate prescription drug plans and return that money to the Medicare \nTrust Fund.\n  This is not just about access to the Federal entitlement program--\nit's about life and death.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this \nlegislation and move for its immediate passage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2181\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare State Reimbursement \n     Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FEDERAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR STATE PRESCRIPTION DRUG \n                   EXPENDITURES FOR COVERED PART D DRUGS FOR \n                   MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES.\n\n       Section 1935(c) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1396v(c)) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1)(A), by striking ``Each of the 50 \n     States'' and inserting ``Subject to paragraph (7), each of \n     the 50 States''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(7) Offset for state prescription drug expenditures for \n     covered part d drugs for medicare beneficiaries.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The amount of payment for a month \n     (beginning with January 2006) under paragraph (1) shall be \n     reduced by an amount equal to the sum of--\n       ``(i) the amount (as documented by the State) that the \n     State expended during the month for payment for covered part \n     D drugs for part D eligible individuals who are enrolled in a \n     prescription drug plan under part D of title XVIII but were \n     unable to access on a timely basis prescription drug benefits \n     to which they were entitled under such plan; and\n       ``(ii) interest on such amount (for the period beginning on \n     the day after the date on which an expenditure described in \n     subparagraph (A) is made and ending on the date on which \n     payment is made under paragraph (1)) at a rate equal to the \n     weighted average of interest on 3-month marketable Treasury \n     securities determined for such period, increased by 0.1 \n     percentage point.\n       ``(B) Recovery of reduced payment from prescription drug \n     plans.--The Secretary shall provide for recovery of payment \n     reductions made under subparagraph (A) from those \n     prescription drug plans under part D of title XVIII or MA-PD \n     plans under part C of such title that would otherwise be \n     responsible for the expenditures described in subparagraph \n     (A)(i). Any such amounts recovered shall be deposited into \n     the Medicare Prescription Drug Account in the Federal \n     Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund.''.\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator \nLautenberg today to introduce urgent legislation to assist the many \nStates which have stepped forward to provide an essential safety net to \nour Medicare Part D beneficiaries. Our States have acted as ``payers of \nlast resort''--as beneficiaries faced unaffordable costs when errors in \nimplementing their coverage\n\n[[Page S131]]\n\ndenied them access to vital medications. The Medicare State \nReimbursement Act will reimburse our States for their costs in assuring \nthat millions receive their medications. So many of our colleagues have \nrecognized the crisis which was averted--Senators Coleman, Schumer, \nDeWine, Feinstein, Collins, Jeffords and many more have joined us in \nthis bipartisan effort to support the States in the vital role they \nhave played in countering a deficit of action by the Federal \nbureaucracy.\n  The introduction of the prescription drug benefit is a landmark step \nin the progress of Medicare. This benefit will save the average senior \nabout $1,000 per year. This is the relief that millions have needed for \nso long. It must eliminate the terrible choices so many have had to \nmake between vital medications and the other essentials of life--not \ncreate new dilemmas.\n  As we worked to ensure a prescription drug benefit, many of us worked \nhard to assure special help to those with the most limited resources. \nWe enacted a benefit which provided additional help for those on \nlimited incomes, including millions who rely on both Medicare and \nMedicaid--our ``dual eligibles''. It was essential that these \nindividuals would see uninterrupted coverage of their essential \nmedications. So we needed to ensure each would be enrolled in a drug \nplan. To do this, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, \nrandomly assigned each of them to a plan. In a program based on \ncompetition--based on choices--plans are going to differ. To find the \nbest plan, one must make an educated choice, not a random assignment.\n  So the result of random assignment was predictable. Many \nbeneficiaries wound up in plans which did not cover their drugs. My \nState of Maine immediately stepped forward to work to assure that every \nbeneficiary was matched with the plan which best met their needs. As \nplans were reviewed, my State found a third of those reviewed--15,000 \nbeneficiaries--were not enrolled in the most appropriate drug plan. \nGetting each into the plan that met their medication requirements was \nessential to meeting their needs.\n  Despite these best efforts to improve the situation, some \nbeneficiaries were not in a plan at all, while others were in plans \nwhich seemed not to understand that every beneficiary was to be allowed \na refill of their existing medications. So as beneficiaries came to \ntheir local pharmacies to get prescription refills, many faced great \nobstacles in getting the drugs they needed. We had heard of some \nproblems in validating enrollment eligibility, but at year end, these \njust became worse, and we found beneficiaries were not properly \nenrolled, plans were not giving the proper transition refills, and co-\npayments charged were often excessive. As individual faced co-payments \nof $100 or more--instead of the $5 or less they should have been \ncharged--many simply couldn't afford their medications. Thankfully, our \nStates have stepped in to make sure low income seniors received their \nmedications. In Maine alone, approximately $5 million in assistance has \nbeen given to ensure medications are dispensed.\n  This drug benefit must increase access, not make it more difficult. I \nam appalled, that with all the technology we have, so many have faced \nsuch difficulties in the implementation of this benefit. I salute the \nforbearance of our pharmacies, as they strived to meet essential needs, \nand the efforts of my State and others which have assured that these \nmost vulnerable Americans not suffer from the failures of either the \nFederal bureaucracy or the plan administrators.\n  So what this legislation does is simple. It authorizes CMS to \nreimburse the States their costs which they paid for providing \nmedications to those who did not receive the benefits to which they \nwere entitled. It does this by a simple mechanism: an adjustment in the \n``claw back'' payments which States make as their contribution for \ntheir dual eligibles. Accordingly, CMS is authorized to collect those \nfunds from those who were obligated to serve our beneficiaries--the \ndrug plans and managed care plans which deliver the drug benefit.\n  It has been confirmed that CMS does not presently have this \nauthority, and it simply is not acceptable to propose that CMS will \nsimply help the States collect from the plans. It was CMS which \napproved the plans, and it is CMS which administers Part D. They are in \nthe best position to assure plan compliance.\n  I look forward to prompt consideration of this legislation, and look \nforward to continuing work with my colleagues to assure that the \nMedicare drug benefit meets the needs of all our beneficiaries, and \nthat none of our most vulnerable citizens should suffer from such \nadministrative failures as we have seen here.\n  I call on my colleagues to join us in assuring our States are justly \ncompensated.\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with \nSenators Lautenberg, Snowe, Schumer, Coleman and many others to \nintroduce legislation to reimburse States for prescription drug \nexpenses they have incurred for their residents who are dually eligible \nfor Medicare and Medicaid. States have had no other option but to step \nin and ensure seniors can still get their drugs because the \nimplementation of the new Medicare drug benefit has been so poorly \nhandled by the Bush administration.\n  The faulty implementation of the new drug benefit has caused a major \nhealth emergency in California and States across the country, \nparticularly for seniors with chronic and debilitating diseases who \nrely on multiple medications every day to keep them alive.\n  It is incomprehensible to me that with all the money and time given \nto the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, to implement \nthis new drug benefit, stories emerge every day of seniors and disabled \nindividuals being hospitalized because they are being told they have to \npay hundreds of dollars for their medications which they cannot afford \nand thus don't take.\n  Because of severe glitches in the database run by CMS, these \nindividuals are leaving pharmacies without their medications or are \nmaking undue sacrifices to pay for costs they should not have incurred \nin the first place.\n  So far, more than 24 States and the District of Columbia have stepped \nin to say they will cover the cost of prescription drugs for their \nresidents who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid and who \ncannot access lifesaving and life sustaining drugs as a result of \nFederal incompetence.\n  Earlier this week, the Governor of California and California's State \nlegislative leaders announced a plan to make $150 million available for \n30 days to cover drug costs for dual eligible individuals who have \nfallen through the system. In California, these individuals account for \nmore than 1 million of the State's 4 million total Medicare recipients.\n  Problems with the Bush administration's implementation of the drug \nbenefit have cost California $5.5 million to fill 63,000 prescriptions, \nas of January 18. I have no doubt these costs are just the beginning.\n  Unless these significant implementation errors are fixed immediately, \nthe new drug benefit amounts to a massive unfunded mandate. The Bush \nadministration must reimburse States, in full, for the drug costs they \nhave absorbed as a result of major implementation errors that occurred \non their watch.\n  The legislation I am introducing today with Senators Lautenberg, \nSnowe, Schumer and Coleman will ensure that States are repaid in full \nby the Federal Government for all costs associated with prescription \ndrugs for dual eligible individuals. The States did not create the \ncrisis felt by our Nation's poorest and most vulnerable seniors and \ndisabled and the States should not be responsible for costs associated \nwith a Federal program that was intended to provide these individuals \nwith comprehensive prescription drug coverage at little or no cost.\n  It is simply unacceptable for the Bush administration to tell States \nand the Congress not to worry because the private health insurance \nplans will reimburse States for the costs they've incurred. States \nshould not be made to wait to be reimbursed because of implementation \nfoul-ups caused by CMS.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n        Bingaman, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Clinton,\n\n[[Page S132]]\n\n        Mr. Lautenberg, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n        Schumer, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \n        Harkin, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Johnson, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Akaka, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mr. Kohl, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Sarbanes, and Mrs. \n        Boxer):\n  S. 2183.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nestablish fairness in the treatment of certain pension plans maintained \nby churches, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nfix an unfortunate application of our current pension rules on church \npension beneficiaries.\n  Church pensions are critically important compensation plans that help \nsupport over a million clergy members across the country in their \nretirement, particularly those who dedicated their careers to serving \nin economically disadvantaged congregations.\n  Some of these plans date back to the 18th Century, and they are \ndesigned to ensure that our pastors and lay staff who are often paid \nlower salaries have adequate resources during their retirement years.\n  Unfortunately, the Internal Revenue Code impedes the ability of \nchurch pensions to recognize these valuable contributions to society \nwith provisions that negatively impact church plans while exempting \nother equally important plans.\n  For example, Section 415(b)(1)(B) of the Code limits benefits for a \nretired church employee to 100 percent of the participant's average \ncompensation for his or her highest three years.\n  This limitation penalizes church employees because some church plans \nallow lower-paid employees to accrue benefits based on median salaries \nrather than their own, individual, lower compensation.\n  While the Code allows exceptions to this general limitation for \ngovernmental and multiemployer plans, it does not allow one for church \nplans.\n  The rationale for allowing an exception for governmental plans but \nnot church plans cannot be reconciled when one acknowledges the \nsituation in which most ministers find themselves when they retire.\n  For example, ministers often live in parsonages throughout their \ncareers; and they are faced with acquiring housing for the first time \nwhen they retire.\n  Not having a significant asset in retirement, such as a house--an \nasset which could be used as collateral and security in time of need, \nleaves ministers vulnerable in their retirement years and justifies the \nneed for including church pension beneficiaries in an exception to the \ngeneral limitation.\n  The Code further punishes church pensions by requiring church plans \nto pay unrelated business income taxes on investments in leveraged real \nestate, while exempting the vast majority of retirement plans from this \nvery same tax.\n  This unequal treatment is simply unfair, and it is time we correct \nit.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would rectify this unequal \ntreatment by exempting church plans from the 415(b)(1)(B) limit and the \nunrelated business income tax.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me today in establishing parity for the \nbeneficiaries of church pensions by supporting this necessary, long \nover-due fix to the Internal Revenue Code.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2193\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S136]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill for the relief of Ilya Shestakov; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I offer today two private relief bills to \nprovide lawful permanent resident status to Nadezda Shestakova and her \nson, Ilya Shestakov.\n  The Shestakov family has lived and worked in Anchorage, Alaska for \nmore than ten years. Nadezda has now returned to Russia, and Ilya is \nattending high school in Canada, in order to avoid further immigration \nproblems, and to demonstrate that they intend to be good citizens who \nlive within the letter of the law.\n  Nadezda's husband, Michail, is a legal immigrant working for Aleut \nEnterprise Corporation (AEC), an Alaska native corporation, and their \nyoungest son is a United States citizen. Both remain in Anchorage \nawaiting the reunion of their family.\n  During their time in Alaska, Michail has been an exemplary employee \nof the Aleut Corporation. As a matter of fact, it was the Aleut \nCorporation who first brought this issue to my attention, as they wish \nto support the Shestakov family in any way possible.\n  The children have excelled in school, and Nadezda has remained an at-\nhome mother, pursuant to the terms of her original visa.\n  The Shestakov family's problems began when they overstayed their visa \ndue to an error by their attorney, who did not file the extension \npaperwork on their behalf, as requested.\n  These are upstanding members of the Alaska community, and they should \nnot be punished due to an error by their former attorney. I would like \nto see this family reunited in Alaska, so that they can continue to \ncontribute positively to our community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/25/senate-section/article/S136-1", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 349--CONDEMNING THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAN FOR VIOLATING \n   THE TERMS OF THE 2004 PARIS AGREEMENT, AND EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR \n EFFORTS TO REFER IRAN TO THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL FOR ITS \n   NONCOMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY OBLIGATIONS\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM (for himself and Mr. Kyl) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 349\n\n       Whereas the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) \n     reported in November 2003 that Iran had been developing an \n     undeclared nuclear enrichment program for 18 years and had \n     covertly imported nuclear material and equipment, carried out \n     over 110 unreported experiments to produce uranium metal, \n     separated plutonium, and concealed many other aspects of its \n     nuclear facilities;\n       Whereas, in November 2004, the Governments of the United \n     Kingdom, France, and Germany entered into an agreement with \n     Iran on Iran's nuclear program (commonly known as the ``Paris \n     Agreement''), successfully securing a commitment from the \n     Government of Iran to voluntarily suspend uranium enrichment \n     operations in exchange for discussions on economic, \n     technological, political, and security issues;\n       Whereas Article XII.C of the Statute of the IAEA requires \n     the IAEA Board of Governors to report the noncompliance of \n     any member of the IAEA with its IAEA obligations to all \n     members and to the Security Council and General Assembly of \n     the United Nations;\n       Whereas Article III.B-4 of the Statute of the IAEA \n     specifies that ``if in connection with the activities of the \n     Agency there should arise questions that are within the \n     competence of the Security Council, the Agency shall notify \n     the Security Council, as the organ bearing the main \n     responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and \n     security'';\n       Whereas, in September 2005, the IAEA Board of Governors \n     adopted a resolution declaring that Iran's many failures and \n     breaches constitute noncompliance in the context of Article \n     XII.C of the Statute of the IAEA;\n       Whereas, on January 3, 2006, the Government of Iran \n     announced that it planned to restart its nuclear research \n     efforts in direct violation of the Paris Agreement;\n       Whereas, in January 2006, Iranian officials, in the \n     presence of IAEA inspectors, began to remove United Nations \n     seals from the enrichment facility in Natanz, Iran;\n       Whereas Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom Jack Straw \n     warned Iranian officials that they were ``pushing their \n     luck'' by removing the United Nations seals that were placed \n     on the Natanz facility by the IAEA 2 years earlier;\n       Whereas President of France Jacques Chirac said that the \n     Governments of Iran and North Korea risk making a ``serious \n     error'' by pursuing nuclear activities in defiance of \n     international agreements;\n       Whereas Foreign Minister of Germany Frank-Walter Steinmeier \n     said that the Government of Iran had ``crossed lines which it \n     knew would not remain without consequences'';\n       Whereas Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice stated, ``It is \n     obvious that if Iran cannot be brought to live up to its \n     international obligations, in fact, the IAEA Statute would \n     indicate that Iran would have to be referred to the U.N. \n     Security Council.'';\n       Whereas President of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad stated, ``The \n     Iranian government and nation has no fear of the Western \n     ballyhoo and will continue its nuclear programs with \n     decisiveness and wisdom.'';\n       Whereas the United States has joined with the Governments \n     of Britain, France, and Germany in calling for a meeting of \n     the IAEA to discuss Iran's non-compliance with its IAEA \n     obligations;\n       Whereas President Ahmadinejad has stated that Israel should \n     be ``wiped off the map'';

Mr. President, today I am submitting this \nresolution expressing the sense of the Senate that the Authorization \nfor Use of Military Force, which Congress passed to authorize military \naction against those responsible for the attacks on September 11, 2001, \ndid not authorize warrantless eavesdropping on American citizens.\n  As Justice O'Connor underscored recently, even war ``is not a blank \ncheck for the President when it comes to the rights of the Nation's \ncitizens.''\n  Now that the illegal spying of Americans has become public and the \nPresident has acknowledged the 4-year-old program, the Bush \nadministration's lawyers are contending that Congress authorized it. \nThe September 2001 Authorization to Use Military Force did no such \nthing. Republican Senators also know it and a few have said so \npublicly. We all know it. The liberties and rights that define us as \nAmericans and the system of checks and balances that serve to preserve \nthem should not be sacrificed to threats of terrorism or to the \nexpanding power of the government. In the days immediately following \nthose attacks, I said, and I continue to believe, that the terrorists \nwin if they frighten us into sacrificing our freedoms and what defines \nus as Americans.\n  I well remember the days immediately after the 9/11 attacks. I helped \nopen the Senate to business the next day. I said then, on September 12, \n2001:\n\n       ``If we abandon our democracy to battle them, they win. . . \n     . We will maintain our democracy, and with justice, we will \n     use our strength. We will not lose our commitment to the rule \n     of law, no matter how much the provocation, because that rule \n     of law has protected us throughout the centuries. It has \n     created our democracy. It has made us what we are in history. \n     We are a just and good Nation.''\n\n  I joined with others, Republican and Democrats, and we engaged in \nround-the-clock efforts over the next months in connection with what \ncame to be the USA PATRIOT Act. During those days the Bush \nadministration never asked us for this surveillance authority or to \namend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to accommodate such a \nprogram.\n  Just as we cannot allow ourselves to be lulled into a sense of false \ncomfort when it comes to our national security, we cannot allow \nourselves to be lulled into a blind trust regarding our freedoms and \nrights. The Framers built checks and balances into our system \nspecifically to counter such abuses and undue assertions of power. We \nmust remain vigilant on all fronts or we stand to lose these rights \nforever. Once lost or eroded, liberty is difficult if not impossible to \nrestore. The Bush administration's after-the-fact claims about the \nbreadth of the Authorization to Use Military Force--as recently as this \nweek, in a document prepared at the White House's behest by the \nDepartment of Justice--are the latest in a long line of manipulations \nof the law. We have also seen this type of overreaching in that same \nJustice Department office's twisted interpretation of the torture \nstatute, an analysis that had to be withdrawn; with the detention of \nsuspects without charges and denial of access to counsel; and with the \nmisapplication of the material witness statute as a sort of general \npreventive detention law. Such abuses serve to harm our national \nsecurity as well as our civil liberties.\n\n  In addition, the press reports that the Pentagon maintains secret \ndatabases containing information on a wide cross-section of ordinary \nAmericans, and that the FBI is monitoring law-abiding citizens in the \nexercise of their First Amendment freedoms. When I worked with Senator \nWyden and others in 2003 to stop Admiral Poindexter's Total Information \nAwareness program, an effort designed to datamine information on \nAmericans--and we meant it. And when I added a reporting requirement on \nCarnivore, the FBI's\ne-mail monitoring program, to the Department of Justice Authorizations \nlaw in 2002, we meant it. We demanded that Congress be kept informed \nand that any such program not proceed without congressional \nauthorization.\n  The New York Times reported that after September 11, 2001, when \nformer Attorney General John Ashcroft loosened restrictions on the FBI \nto permit it to monitor Web sites, mosques, and other public entities, \n``the FBI has used that authority to investigate not only groups with \nsuspected ties to foreign terrorists, but also protest groups suspected \nof having links to violent or disruptive activities.'' When I learned \nof such efforts and that they reportedly included monitoring Quakers in \nFlorida and possibly Vermont, I wrote to the Secretary of Defense \ndemanding an answer. That was a month ago. So far he has refused to \nprovide that answer.\n  Now we have learned that President Bush has, for more than four \nyears, secretly allowed the warrantless wiretapping of Americans inside \nthe United States. And we read in the press that sources at the FBI say \nthat much of what was forwarded to them to investigate was worthless \nand led to dead ends. That is a dangerous diversion of our \ninvestigative resources away from those who pose real threats, while \nprecious time and effort is devoted to looking into the lives of law-\nabiding Americans.\n  The United States Supreme Court has consistently held for nearly 40 \nyears, since its landmark decision in Katz v. United States, that the \nmonitoring and recording of private conversations constitutes a \n``search and seizure'' within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. \nCongress enacted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, \nFISA, to provide a legal mechanism for the government to engage in \nelectronic surveillance of Americans in connection with intelligence \ngathering. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, along with\n\n[[Page S138]]\n\nthe criminal wiretap authority in title 18 of the United States Code, \ntogether provide the exclusive means by which the Government may \nintercept domestic electronic communications pursuant to the rule of \nlaw.\n  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act has been amended over time, \nand it has been adjusted several times since the 9/11 attacks. Indeed, \nmuch of the PATRIOT Act was devoted to modifying FISA to make it easier \nto obtain FISA warrants. But the PATRIOT Act did not amend FISA to give \nthe Government the authority to conduct warrantless surveillance of \nAmerican citizens.\n\n  If the Bush administration believed that the law was inadequate to \ndeal with the threat of terrorism within our boundaries, it should have \ncome to Congress and sought to change the law. It did not. Indeed, \nAttorney General Gonzales admitted at a press conference on December \n19, 2005, that the Administration did not seek to amend FISA to \nauthorize the NSA spying program because it was advised that ``it was \nnot something we could likely get.''\n  I chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2001 and 2002, when the \nPresident's secret eavesdropping program apparently began. I was not \ninformed of the program. I learned about it for the first time in the \npress last month. I thank heaven and the Constitution that we still \nhave a free press.\n  The Bush administration is now arguing that when Congress authorized \nthe use of force in September 2001 to attack al Qaeda in Afghanistan, \nit authorized warrantless searches and eavesdropping on American \ncitizens. I voted for that authorization, and I know that Congress did \nnot sign a blank check. The notion that Congress authorized warrantless \nsurveillance in the AUMF is utterly inconsistent with the Attorney \nGeneral's admission that Congress was not asked for such authorization \nbecause it was assumed that Congress would say no.\n  Former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, who helped negotiate the \nuse of force resolution with the White House, has confirmed that the \nsubject of warrantless wiretaps of American citizens never came up, \nthat he did not and never would have supported giving authority to the \nPresident for such wiretaps, and that he is ``confident that the 98 \nsenators who voted in favor of authorization of force against al Qaeda \ndid not believe that they were also voting for warrantless domestic \nsurveillance.''\n  Senator Daschle also noted that the Bush administration sought to add \nlanguage to the resolution that would have explicitly authorized the \nuse of force ``in the United States,'' but Congress refused to grant \nthe President such sweeping power. Maybe that was this Administration's \ncovert way to seek the authority to spy on Americans, but Congress did \nnot grant any such authority.\n  Spying on Americans without first obtaining the requisite warrants is \nillegal, unnecessary and wrong. No President can simply declare when he \nwishes to follow the law and when he chooses not to, especially when it \ncomes to the hard-won rights of the American people.\n  The resolution I submit today is intended to help set the record \nstraight. It is an important first step toward restoring checks and \nbalances between the co-equal branches of government. I urge all \nSenators to support it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, what is past is prologue. Today, we see \nhistory repeating itself. In 1978, President Carter signed into law the \n``Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act,'' successfully concluding \nyears of debate on the power of the President to conduct national \nsecurity wiretapping.\n  As a result of lengthy hearings and consultation, Congress enacted \nthat law with broad bipartisan support. Its purpose was clear--to put a \ncheck on the power of the President to use wiretaps in the name of \nnational security. One of the clear purposes of that law was to require \nthe government to obtain a judicial warrant for all electronic \nsurveillance in the United States in which communications of U.S. \ncitizens might be intercepted. The Act established a secret court, the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court, to review wiretapping \napplications and guarantee that any such electronic surveillance \nfollowed the rule of law. Since 1979, the special court has approved \nnearly 19,000 applications and denied only 4. Last year, the \nAdministration reached an all-time-high with the number of applications \ngranted.\n  In the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, Congress established \nthe exclusive means by which electronic surveillance could be conducted \nin the United States for national security purposes. One of the \nprincipal goals of the legislation was to ensure that information \nobtained from illegal wiretaps could not be used to obtain a warrant \nfrom the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. We even made sure \nthat there would be criminal penalties for anyone who failed to comply \nwith these rules.\n  The PATRIOT Act did not give the President the authority to spy on \nanyone without impartial judicial review--and neither did the Joint \nResolution, enacted in 2001, authorizing the use of force against those \nresponsible for the attacks of September 11th.\n  The President seemed to agree. In 2004, in Buffalo he stated \ncategorically that ``any time that you hear the United States talking \nabout a wiretap, it requires a court order.'' He said that ``Nothing \nhad changed--when we're talking about chasing down terrorists, we're \ntalking about getting a court order before we do so.''\n  Now, however, the President and the administration claim they do not \nhave to comply with the law. Just yesterday, the administration again \nasserted its constitutional authority to eavesdrop on any person within \nthe United States--without judicial or legislative oversight and it \nclaims that the Congress implicitly granted such power in the Joint \nResolution of 2001.\n  But that Joint Resolution says nothing about domestic electronic \nsurveillance. As Justice O'Connor has said, ``A state of war is not a \nblank check for the president when it comes to the rights of the \nnation's citizens.''\n  The bipartisan 9/11 Commission made clear that the Executive Branch \nhas the burden of proof to justify why a particular governmental power \nshould be retained--and Congress has the responsibility to see that \nadequate guidelines and oversight are made available.\n  The Executive Branch has failed to meet the 9/11 Commissioners' \nburden of proof. The American people are not convinced that these \nsurveillance methods achieve the right balance between our national \nsecurity and protection of our civil liberties.\n  These issues go to the heart of what it means to have a free society. \nIf President Bush can make his own rules for domestic surveillance, Big \nBrother has run amok. If the President believes that winning the war on \nterror requires new surveillance capabilities, he has a responsibility \nto work with Congress to make appropriate changes in existing law. He \nis not above the law.\n  Congress and the American people deserve full and honest answers \nabout the Administration's domestic electronic surveillance activities. \nOn December 22, 2005, I asked the President to provide us with answers \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee began hearings on Judge Alito's \nnomination to the Supreme Court. We got no response. The Senate \nJudiciary Committee is scheduled to begin separate hearings on February \n6 on the President's actions. Instead of providing us with the \ndocuments the Administration relied upon, the Justice Department \ncontinues to circulate summaries and ``white papers'' on the legal \nauthorities it purports to have to ignore the law. It now appears that \nthe President did so on at least thirty occasions after September 11. \nThere is no legitimate purpose in denying access by Members of Congress \nto all of the legal thought and analysis that the President relied upon \nwhen he authorized these activities.\n  Every 45 days, the President ordered these activities to be reviewed \nby the Attorney General, the White House Counsel and the Inspector \nGeneral of the National Security Agency. That's not good enough. These \nare all executive branch appointees who report directly to the \nPresident.\n  Congress spent seven years considering and enacting the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act. It was not a hastily conceived idea. We \nhad broad agreement that both Congressional oversight and judicial \noversight were fundamental--even during emergencies\n\n[[Page S139]]\n\nor times of war, which is why we established a secret court to expedite \nthe review of sensitive applications from the government.\n  Now, the administration has made a unilateral decision that \nCongressional and judicial oversight can be discarded, in spite of what \nthe law obviously requires. We need a thorough investigation of these \nactivities. Congress and the American people deserve answers, and they \ndeserve answers now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/25/senate-section/article/S139-1", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 351--RESPONDING TO THE THREAT POSED BY IRAN'S NUCLEAR \n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. BAYH submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 351\n\n       Whereas Iran is precipitating a grave nuclear crisis with \n     the international community that directly impacts the \n     national security of the United States and the efficacy of \n     the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Treaty \n     on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at \n     Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered into \n     force March 5, 1970 (commonly referred to as the ``Nuclear \n     Non-Proliferation Treaty'');\n       Whereas the United States welcomes a diplomatic solution to \n     the nuclear crisis, but the Government of Iran continues to \n     reject a peaceful resolution to the matter;\n       Whereas, although the Government of Iran agreed to suspend \n     uranium enrichment activities and to sign and ratify the \n     IAEA's Additional Protocol on expansive, intrusive no-notice \n     inspections in 2003, it has repeatedly failed to live up to \n     its obligations under this agreement;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran broke IAEA seals on some \n     centrifuges in September 2004, converted uranium to a gas \n     needed for enrichment in May 2005, limited IAEA inspectors to \n     a few sites, and said it would restart uranium conversion \n     activities;\n       Whereas the Board of Governors of the IAEA declared in \n     September 2005 that Iran was in non-compliance of its Nuclear \n     Non-Proliferation Treaty obligations;\n       Whereas Iran announced on January 3, 2006, that it would \n     resume uranium ``research'' activities at Natanz and invited \n     IAEA to witness the breaking of IAEA seals at the facility;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran has acknowledged deceiving \n     the IAEA for the past 18 years for not disclosing an uranium \n     enrichment facility in Natanz and a heavy water production \n     plant in Arak;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran's human rights practices and \n     strict limits on democracy have been consistently criticized \n     by United Nations reports;\n       Whereas the Department of State stated in its most recent \n     Country Reports on Human Rights Practices that Iran's already \n     poor human rights record ``worsened'' during the previous \n     year and deemed Iran a country ``of particular concern'' in \n     its most recent International Religious Freedom Report;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran funds terror and \n     rejectionist groups in Gaza and the West Bank, Lebanon, Iraq, \n     and Afghanistan and is providing material support to groups \n     directly involved in the killing of United States citizens;\n       Whereas Iran has been designated by the United States as a \n     state sponsor of terrorism since 1984, and the Department of \n     State said in its most recent Country Reports on Terrorism \n     that Iran ``remained the most active state sponsor of \n     terrorism in 2004'';\n       Whereas President of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has made \n     repeated anti-American and anti-semitic statements, including \n     denying the occurrence of the Holocaust and Israel's right to \n     exist, and called on people to imagine a world without the \n     United States;\n       Whereas Iran's recent acquisition of new anti-ship \n     capabilities to block the Strait of Hormuz at the entrance to \n     the Persian Gulf and the decision by the Government of Russia \n     to sell the Government of Iran $1,000,000,000 in weapons, \n     mostly for 29 antiaircraft missile systems, is most \n     regrettable and should dampen United States-Russian \n     relations;\n       Whereas the behavior of the Government of Iran does not \n     reflect that country's rich history and the democratic \n     aspirations of most people in Iran;\n       Whereas the people of the United States stand with the \n     people of Iran in support of democracy, the rule of law, \n     religious freedom, and regional and global stability;\n       Whereas, although Iran is subject to a range of unilateral \n     sanctions and some third country and foreign entities \n     sanctions, these sanctions have not been fully implemented;\n       Whereas Iran remains vulnerable to international sanctions, \n     especially with respect to financial services and foreign \n     investment in its petroleum sector and oil sales, few foreign \n     nations have joined the United States in attempting to \n     isolate the regime in Iran and compel compliance with Iran's \n     international obligations;\n       Whereas, although Iran may be one of the world's largest \n     exporters of oil, it does not have the refining capacity to \n     make the gasoline necessary to make its economy run and \n     currently imports 40 percent of its refined gasoline from \n     abroad;\n       Whereas more complete implementation of United States \n     sanctions laws and the adoption of additional statutes would \n     improve the chances of a diplomatic solution to the nuclear \n     crisis with Iran;\n       Whereas President George W. Bush has for 4 years given too \n     little attention to the growing nuclear problem in Iran \n     beyond rhetorical sound bites and has carried out an Iran \n     policy consisting of loud denunciations followed by minimal \n     action and ultimate deference of managing the crisis to \n     Europe, a policy that has been riddled with contradiction and \n     inconsistency and damaging to United States national \n     security;\n       Whereas, had President Bush effectively marshaled world \n     opinion in 2002 and not wasted valuable time, diverted \n     resources, and ignored the problem in Iran, the United States \n     would not be faced with the full extent of the current \n     nuclear crisis in Iran;\n       Whereas action now is imperative and time is of the \n     essence; and\n       Whereas the opportunity the United States has to avoid the \n     choice between military action and a nuclear Iran may be \n     measured only in months: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States should cut assistance to countries \n     whose companies are investing in Iran's energy sector, \n     including pipelines to export Iranian crude;\n       (2) supplies of refined gasoline to Iran should be cut off;\n       (3) there should be a worldwide, comprehensive ban on sales \n     of weapons to Iran, including from Russia and China;\n       (4) the United Nations Security Council should impose an \n     intrusive IAEA-led weapons of mass destruction inspection \n     regime on Iran similar to that imposed on Iraq after the 1991 \n     Persian Gulf war;\n       (5) the United Nations Security Council should adopt \n     reductions in diplomatic exchanges with Iran, limit travel by \n     some Iranian officials, and limit or ban sports or cultural \n     exchanges with Iran;\n       (6) the President should more faithfully implement the Iran \n     and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996 (50 U.S.C. 1701 note) \n     (commonly known as ``ILSA''), and Congress should--\n       (A) increase the requirements on the President to justify \n     waiving ILSA-related sanctions;\n       (B) repeal the sunset provision of ILSA;\n       (C) set a 90-day time limit for the President to determine \n     whether an investment constitutes a violation of ILSA; and\n       (D) make exports to Iran of technology related to weapons \n     of mass destruction sanctionable under ILSA;\n       (7) the United States should withdraw its support for \n     Iran's accession to the WTO until Iran meets weapons of mass \n     destruction, human rights, terrorism, and regional stability \n     standards; and\n       (8) the United States must make the Government of Iran \n     understand that if its nuclear activity continues it will be \n     treated as a pariah state.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/25/senate-section/article/S139-2", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S139-S140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 76--CONDEMNING THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAN FOR \n   ITS FLAGRANT VIOLATIONS OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE NUCLEAR NON-\n PROLIFERATION TREATY, AND CALLING FOR CERTAIN ACTIONS IN RESPONSE TO \n                            SUCH VIOLATIONS\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Allen, Mr. \nDeWine, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Nelson of Florida, \nand Mrs. Feinstein) submitted the following concurrent resolution; \nwhich was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of Senate Resolution 353, which was \nsubmitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The resolution (S. Res. 353) expressing concern with the \n     deliberate undermining of democratic freedoms and justice in \n     Cambodia by Prime Minister Hun Sen and the Government of \n     Cambodia.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. Today, the Prime Minister of Cambodia dropped the criminal \ndefamation lawsuits against five government critics and human rights \nadvocates.\n  Along with the administration, I welcome the Prime Minister's \ndecision and applaud his efforts to recognize the right of free \npolitical exchange. I am hopeful that today's action represents \nprogress and a greater commitment to human rights and civil society on \nthe part of the ruling authority.\n  In recent months, we have had cause for alarm that the Government of \nCambodia is engaged in a campaign of political persecution and \nintimidation. Prime Minister Hun Sen and his apparatus have \nconsistently and blatantly violated basic democratic principles, the \nrule of law, and human rights as enshrined in the Cambodian \nConstitution.\n  Tonight, the Senate stands unified in calling upon Prime Minister Sen \nand the government of Cambodia: To immediately cease and desist from \nits systematic campaign to undermine democracy, the rule of law, and \nhuman rights; to immediately release all political prisoners and drop \nall politically motivated charges against opponents of the government; \nand to demonstrate through word and deed the government's commitment to \ndemocracy, the rule of law, and human rights;\n  We also call upon the King of Cambodia to play a more active and \nconstructive role in protecting the constitutional rights of Cambodian \ncitizens. And we urge international donors and multilateral \norganizations, including the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, \nand the United Nations, to hold the Prime Minister and his government \nfully accountable for actions that undermine the investment of \ninternational donors in the democratic and economic development of \nCambodia.\n  I would like to thank Senator McConnell and Senator McCain for their \nleadership and commitment to the people of Cambodia. They deserve \nspecial recognition for their unflagging support.\n  Let me close with a report today in the International Herald Tribune. \nAt a recent gathering of 800 impoverished farmers and townspeople in a \nvillage south of the capitol of Phnom Penh, an elderly Cambodian woman \nasked:\n\n       I have a question for government. You talk about democracy, \n     but how much right do the people of Cambodia have to speak \n     out? If we speak out, will we be arrested like Kem Sokha?\n\n  I put that question to Prime Minister Hun Sen. Will the people be \nallowed to speak out as free citizens in an open and just democracy? \nThe people of Cambodia want to know. And on their behalf, the U.S. \nSenate demands an answer.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the resolution be \nagreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 353) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.
