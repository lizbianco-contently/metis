Mr. President, in Roll Call today, we learned that the \nRepublican majority is going to attempt to finish earlier than we \nanticipated. In fact, the quote is that the majority leader and the \nmajority whip have ``scrapped plans to keep the Senate in session \nthrough the beginning of October, and will instead look to wrap up work \non as many appropriations bills and other must pass measures before \nSeptember 27.''\n  This new adjournment date means the Senate has only 8 more weeks in \nwhich it will be in session, 40 business days. If we subtract Labor \nDay, that makes 39 days. If we subtract Mondays and Fridays--which seem \nto be what we subtract on a weekly basis--there are 23 legislative days \nleft in the 109th Congress--23 days and so much to do.\n  For months, this what others have deemed the do-nothing Republican \nCongress has wasted time on issues such as the nuclear option, the \nmarriage amendment, drilling in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge, flag \nburning, bankruptcy class action, and, of course, time and again, the \nestate tax repeal.\n  As a result, here we are with only a handful of weeks remaining--in \nfact, a handful of days, 23--to do so much and to address the \npriorities of the American people.\n  I had a wonderful week last week in Las Vegas, in Searchlight. I \ntraveled the State. I spent it all in southern Nevada. The concerns I \nheard from my constituents are the same concerns this Republican \nCongress has been ignoring for the last 18 months.\n  For example, I traveled a few miles out of Las Vegas. Years ago it \nseemed as though it was a long way out of Las Vegas. From downtown Las \nVegas, it is less than an hour to a place called Coyote Springs. It is \npartially in Lincoln County and partially in Clark County. We were \nthere talking about a new development. At that place in the desert, \nthey are going to build 159,000 new homes--159,000 new homes--creating \nhalf a million jobs. Those people who are going to be living in those \nhomes and building those homes are concerned about the price of \ngasoline, as well they should be.\n  The price of gas this past week has gone up 11 cents a gallon. The \naverage price now in Nevada is over $3 a gallon, more than 50 cents a \ngallon than it was just a year ago. Families are pouring their savings \ninto their gas tanks, but this Republican Congress has done nothing to \nhelp them--and I mean nothing.\n  While they have been quick to address nonissues that the far right \nwants--and these issues have no hope of passing--they spend valuable \ntime on the Senate floor sending a message to their base, is what we \nare told.\n  For example, have we done anything about alternative energy? \nNothing--nothing to harness the sun, the wind, geothermal.\n\n[[Page S7262]]\n\n  Have we done anything to look at global warming? No, nothing.\n  Today in Nevada and across the West and, in fact, across the world, \nreally, people are talking about how the weather has changed. In the \nWest, in Nevada, we are concerned about early wildfires burning \nhundreds of thousands of acres already. New research seems to link \nthese to the change in climate patterns. But has the administration or \nthis Republican Congress taken steps to reduce the risk of \nglobal climate change? No. This administration doesn't even acknowledge \nit exists.\n\n  When the documentary ``Inconvenient Truth'' came out, which is a \ntremendous movie showing the problems we have with global warming--ice \ncaps dropping into the ocean, weather patterns that have changed \nsignificantly, and they are documented--when the President was asked if \nhe was going to watch the movie, he said: Doubt it. In a cavalier \nfashion: I doubt it. No, not ``I doubt it,'' ``Doubt it.''\n  As I have indicated, they are more than willing to debate pet issues \nof the far right, such as the definition of marriage--afraid, I guess, \nof angering their White House or political base by investigating and \ntaking action on global warming.\n  These are tough issues relating to global warming. We have to do \nsomething. It is not going to be easy.\n  Health care is the same story. Today in Nevada there are almost \n450,000 individuals without health insurance; more than 100,000 of them \nare children. Has this Republican Congress done anything in the last 18 \nmonths to help? No. We had Health Week that really wasn't a health \nweek.\n  We have 23 legislative days remaining and a list of items we need to \naccomplish that is a mile long. To say we need to get to work is an \nunderstatement.\n  It is my hope that the majority will make time for these important \nissues before we adjourn. But this afternoon, I want to focus on just \ntwo issues that must come to the floor this month: the Voting Rights \nAct and stem cell legislation.\n  There is no reason we have not dealt with these issues already. The \nHouse passed H.R. 810, the stem cell research bill, more than a year \nago. The original timetable for extending the Voting Rights Act was \nMay, the majority leader telling us he would bring the stem cell bill \nbefore the Senate came more than a year ago. But here we are with 23 \ndays left, and there is still no specific date set for debate on either \nissue.\n  I understand we left for the recess with a stem cell agreement saying \nwe would debate three stem cell measures, but when is not clear. We \nwant to do it this month. That is July, finish the stem cell \nlegislation in July. We can do it. There is 12 hours for each piece of \nlegislation. We can do it in a few days, certainly in a week. We need \nto do this.\n  I am told that the Judiciary Committee is going to schedule markup on \nthe voting rights legislation on Thursday. That is good. That is \nprogress. But we need more. We need the majority leader to schedule a \nspecific date in July for each of these issues to come to the floor. \nEach day these bills are delayed, the majority is withholding hope from \nthe American people.\n  As to the Voting Rights Act, President Johnson came just a few feet \noff the Senate floor to the President's Room to sign the Voting Rights \nAct. People gave their lives, Mr. President, so the Voting Rights Act \nwould pass; they literally gave their lives. I just finished reading a \nwonderful book called ``At Canaan's Edge'' by Taylor Branch. It is 800 \npages all about the last year or two of Dr. King's life and what these \npeople went through to have civil rights legislation passed and the \nVoting Rights Act passed. Literally, they let their blood. They were \nbeaten, stomped, kicked, shot, stabbed, and killed.\n  We need to pass this Voting Rights Act. We need to move it on. It is \ngoing to expire. We need to pass it now. Reauthorizing it will help \nensure that every American citizen has the ability to cast their ballot \nregardless of the language they speak or the color of their skin or \nwhere they live.\n  This legislation should be above politics and partisanship. It is \nabout living up to our founding creed of equality and justice for all. \nThe Voting Rights Act needs to be extended, and there is no reason for \nus to wait.\n  There is no reason for us to wait on stem cell research. Stem cell \nresearch holds promise for medical breakthroughs.\n  I was in church a week ago Sunday. I am not going to mention his \nname, but he is there every Sunday I go. When we are home in \nSearchlight, we go to Boulder City to church. He is in a wheelchair. He \ntapped me on the shoulder. I turned around, and he said: H.R. 810.\n  It took me a while to think what it was, and then I remembered. He \nhas Parkinson's disease. He has hope that this will help him, as do \npeople who are inflicted with diabetes, Lou Gehrig's disease, and \nAlzheimer's.\n  In 23 days we need to do this. This has to be part of our program \nthis month, July: the Voting Rights Act and stem cell legislation.\n  So I hope my friend, the distinguished majority leader, in scheduling \nlegislation for this month, when we get past the Homeland Security \nappropriations bill, will go to one of these two bills and then go to \nthe other one and finish them. It will be a good day for the Senate and \na really good day for our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/10/senate-section/article/S7262-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I think we all know that during this part \nof the session the Senate is going to spend considerable time focusing \non energy issues. That is certainly warranted because, if there is one \nthing that can be agreed on, getting a fresh energy policy is just \nabout the most red, white, and blue step our country can take at this \ncritical time.\n  During the course of this debate, one issue that is sure to come up \nis the issue of oil company profits. The oil companies have \nconsistently said that they need these very large profits in order to \nhave the funds to drill and explore for new energy sources. I certainly \nfeel strongly about developing new energy sources and increasing \nproduction, but I have been concerned about the role of government. At \na time when the oil companies are making record profits and charging \nrecord prices, Congress has still been making available record \nsubsidies. To get some clarity on this issue, I believed it was \nimportant to get the Congressional Research Service, the independent \nauthority, to look at these issues, to analyze the question of exactly \nwhere the oil companies are putting this gusher of revenue they have \naccumulated recently. The findings in the new report the Congressional \nResearch Service has given to me are striking.\n  What the Congressional Research Service has found is that the return \non equity of the major oil companies has gone up in the last few years \nsix times; the amount of cash reserves of the major oil companies have \nhas gone up, over the same time, about six times; but the amount of \nmoney the companies have devoted to exploration and capital investment \nhas only doubled. So what that means, the bottom line, is that the \nmajor oil companies are only putting back in the ground a modest \nfraction of what they have been siphoning away from consumers at the \npump across our country.\n  What I would like to do is break down this report and talk about \nwhere I believe Congress ought to go on a bipartisan basis in the years \nahead.\n\n[[Page S7263]]\n\n  On the issue of return on equity, I asked the Congressional Research \nService to examine the years of 1999 to present. They found that, with \nrespect to return on equity for the oil companies, it was about 4.5 \npercent in 1999 and it is nearly 30 percent as of last year. That is an \nincrease of more than six times over the last 6 years. The \nCongressional Research Service also looked at the cash reserves of the \nlargest oil companies over the last 6 years. They have found that this, \nas well, has gone up sixfold. So the companies are clearly sitting on \ngushers of cash from higher oil prices and higher gas prices that \nconsumers are now paying across the country.\n  I believe it was then appropriate to have the Congressional Research \nService analyze what the oil companies are doing with all of this \nmoney. Certainly the companies have made the argument that they are \ninvesting these profits in exploring for oil and developing new energy \ntechnology. That certainly is part of the story, but it is far from the \nwhole picture.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, the major oil \ncompanies have approximately doubled their exploration costs and their \noverall capital investment over the past 6 years, but that rate of \nincrease is just a fraction of how much their cash reserves and their \nreturn on equity have grown over that period. In addition, \nCongressional Research Service experts indicate that much of the oil \ncompanies' capital investment has been for operating expenses, not for \nincreasing production, and much of what they seem to have invested in \nexploration has gone for overseas exploration.\n  Again, you come back to what I think is the clear conclusion of this \nparticular analysis: The American people are seeing the oil companies \nput back in the ground just a modest part of what the consumer is \ncoughing up at gas pumps across the land.\n  One of the questions I hope we will ask over this next period of the \nSenate being in session is, Why are the oil companies not putting some \nof their burgeoning cash reserves into investment in other \ntechnologies, particularly new renewable energy technologies which \ncould help the oil industry diversify and help reduce our Nation's \ndependence on foreign energy? We ought to examine that issue, and \ncertainly what the Congressional Research Service has done for my \noffice makes a different contribution with respect to this debate and \none that I think warrants thorough examination.\n  The Congressional Research Service looked, for me, at the 10-K \nreports the oil companies file with the Securities and Exchange \nCommission. That is the information which Exxon and BP and Shell and \nChevron and ConocoPhillips, Valero and Sunoco and Total report to their \ninvestors and to Wall Street. But what is in those 10-Ks that are given \nover to the Securities and Exchange Commission is not the story the oil \ncompanies seem to be telling the American people. The oil companies \nhave been running ads in newspapers, claiming that their profits are in \nline with those of other industries. For example, the American \nPetroleum Institute has been running a newspaper ad showing the oil and \nnatural gas industry's earnings of 5.9 cents on a dollar of sales, \nwhich is just above the 5.6-percent average for all industries. But \nsuffice it to say, how many of the industries listed in these oil \ncompany ads are getting the 30-percent rate of return on equity that \nthe Congressional Research Service has found in the report that I make \npublic today?\n\n  The oil industry wants the public to believe that the record profits \nthey are making are in line with other businesses, but it seems to me \nthe Congressional Research Service analysis of the oil companies' own \nreports to the Government tells a very different story. This is \nparticularly important right now because I believe the American people \ndeserve a true accounting of what has been going on behind the numbers \nat the gas pump and where their hard-earned money has been going for \nthe past several years. The report I release today on oil company \nfinancial data shows the oil industry's profits are not only greater \nthan the profits of other businesses, but they also show how the oil \ncompanies have not been straight with the American people.\n  I also think it is timely to have this information about oil company \nprofits because of the debate in both the Senate and in the other body \nabout oil royalty giveaways to the oil industry. At a time of record \nprices, when oil companies are making record profits that are above \nwhat other industries are earning, the question is, Should the oil \ncompanies continue to get record subsidies from the taxpayers?\n  In May, the House of Representatives held a historic vote to put an \nend to taxpayer-funded royalty giveaways to profitable oil companies. \nThe House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis \nto put a stop to this waste of taxpayer funds. Just a few weeks before \nthat House vote, I spent nearly 5 hours trying to get a vote here in \nthe Senate on exactly this issue. But despite that extended discussion, \nI was unable to get an up-or-down vote on my proposal to stop ladling \nout tens of billions of dollars of unnecessary subsidies to the oil \nsector.\n  I believe the Senate ought to have an opportunity to debate and vote \non the oil royalty issue, and it seems especially timely after the new \nreport the Congressional Research Service has supplied to me. With the \nGovernment Accountability Office estimating that tens of billions of \ntaxpayer dollars could be lost as a result of the oil royalty program, \nthis issue is too important to duck.\n  Over the next few weeks, as the Senate debates energy, I am hopeful \nthat the Senate will think carefully about the findings of the \nindependent Congressional Research Service. The Congressional Research \nService analysis indicates to me that the oil industry in their \nadvertisements and other promotions is not being straight with the \nAmerican people. The Congressional Research Service has given us a good \nsense of where the oil sector is actually putting their money, and at a \ntime when their rate of return on equity--30 percent--is certainly very \nstrong and we look at where their cash reserves are--and they are \nsitting on piles of money--we are not seeing those dollars put back \ninto exploration and development here in our country so we can have a \nnew red, white, and blue energy policy that makes us independent from \nsources of foreign oil.\n  Let's work to have a debate in the Senate based on the facts. The \nCongressional Research Service has now given us illuminating \ninformation about what the facts are. Let's make better use of taxpayer \ndollars than to give away tens of billions of dollars in royalties in a \nprogram that began when oil was $19 a barrel and now frequently is well \nover $70 a barrel. This is a time for the Senate to come together on a \nbipartisan basis to look at these issues carefully. The Congressional \nResearch Service report provides an opportunity to get the facts out--\nthe real facts--about what is going on in this critical sector of our \neconomy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the report of the Congressional Research \nService be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Congressional Research Service,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 5, 2006.\n\n\n                               memorandum\n\n     To: Hon. Ron Wyden.\n     Subject: Oil Company Financial Data.\n     From: Robert Pirog, Specialist in Energy Economics and \n         Policy, Resources, Science, and Industry Division.\n       This memorandum is written in response to your request for \n     financial data for selected oil companies for the period 1999 \n     to 2005. The companies for which you requested data are \n     ExxonMobil, BP, Shell, Valero, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, \n     Sunoco, and Total SA. The analysis is complicated by reason \n     of mergers and acquisitions among the selected firms, \n     differences in U.S. and international accounting standards, \n     currency exchange rates, differences in the size of the \n     selected companies, and differences in the extent to which \n     the selected companies participate in all aspects of the oil \n     business. The likely effects of these factors will be noted \n     in the appropriate sections of this memorandum.\n     Profit rates\n       Profit rates are usually expressed as net income as a \n     percentage of a relevant base; usually revenue, shareholder \n     equity, or assets. Each profit rate provides a different \n     measure of the success of the firm. Profit relative to \n     revenue shows how well the firm translates revenue into net \n     income. Profit relative to shareholder equity shows how \n     effective the firm is in utilizing the capital invested in \n     the firm by its owners, the shareholders. Profit relative to \n     assets shows how effective the firm is in utilizing its total \n     asset base to generate net income.\n\n[[Page S7264]]\n\n       Table 1 shows the average return on revenue and the return \n     on equity for the eight selected oil companies. The averages \n     are simple averages; they do not assign weights to account \n     for the different sizes of the firms in the group. \n     ExxonMobil, the largest company in the group, has total \n     revenues over ten times as large as Sunoco, the smallest \n     company in the group. However, a weighted average would still \n     not account for the fact that the sample of eight companies \n     is only a fraction of the industry. For example, the Oil and \n     Gas Journal includes over 130 companies in its oil and gas \n     firms' earning report.\n\n           TABLE 1.

Both profit measures increased when the recent \n     increases in the price of oil began in 2003. Two of the \n     companies in the data set, Valero and Sunoco, are refiners \n     and marketers with no crude oil production. These two firms \n     were not, therefore, positioned to benefit directly from \n     increases in the price of crude oil.\n     Cash reserves\n       Companies might accumulate cash reserves in anticipation of \n     a major merger or acquisition, before a share re-purchase, or \n     before a capital investment expenditure. In the case of the \n     selected oil companies, these reasons might be augmented by \n     the rapid expansion of sales revenues associated with the \n     increases in the prices of crude oil and products from 2003 \n     through 2005. Large investment projects take time to plan and \n     execute, and it may be that the rapidly increasing revenues \n     these firms realized could not be efficiently allocated in \n     the available time.\n       Both upstream (exploration and production) and downstream \n     (refining and marketing) investments in the oil industry tend \n     to cost billions of dollars and take years to plan, complete, \n     and realize returns from. Investment decisions are based on \n     company estimates of the long-term, expected, price of oil. \n     It may not be that the current market price of oil is \n     equivalent to the companies' long-term expected price of oil. \n     If the long-term planning price of oil is significantly lower \n     than the current market price, it might appear that the \n     companies have not increased investment in capacity to a \n     degree commensurate with increased market prices.\n\n            TABLE 2.

Note: Shell, Valero, and ConocoPhillips data could\n  not be obtained for 1999. Shell data could not be obtained for 2000.\n\n       Table 2 shows that the cash reserves of the selected oil \n     companies have more than doubled from 2001 to 2005, the \n     period of complete data. In 2005, three companies, \n     ExxonMobil, Shell, and Chevron accounted for over 87 percent \n     of the total cash reserves.\n     Exploration and capital investment\n       Exploration expenses are undertaken to locate and develop \n     new commercially viable deposits of crude oil and natural \n     gas. Two of the eight companies in the data set, Valero and \n     Sunoco, have no exploration expenses since they operate only \n     in the downstream portion of the industry. Since oil fields \n     deplete over time and production tends to decline, oil \n     producers must carry out a successful exploration program to \n     keep their reserve and production positions constant. \n     However, it cannot be determined from financial data which \n     exploration expenses are ``net'' in the sense of increasing \n     production and reserves, and which are ``gross'', including \n     depletion replacement. As a result, increasing exploration \n     expenses are not necessarily tied to increased production \n     capability or reserves. Most of the firms also report dry \n     hole expenses in exploration. Dry holes do not add to either \n     production capacity or reserves.\n       Capital investment expenditures were drawn from the \n     companies cash flow statements. These values represent actual \n     outlays made during the year. As a result, the values for \n     capital investment reported in Table 3 represent gross \n     investment, rather than investment net of depreciation. In \n     the current economic environment, it is likely that all \n     investments, new, as, well as those that replace depreciated \n     assets, must pass a profitability test to be undertaken. As a \n     result, gross investment is likely to represent well the \n     companies investment decisions.\n\nTABLE 3.

The \n     upstream portion of the market is increasingly controlled by \n     national oil companies, not private firms. The market is also \n     affected by political forces.\n       The private oil companies have the responsibility of making \n     decisions in the best interests of their shareholders. \n     However, because their products are important to the \n     functioning of national economies, their decisions are also \n     of interest to the public. This dual responsibility must be \n     balanced by the companies.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG.

The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, today we begin consideration of the \nHomeland Security appropriations bill. I begin by thanking the members \nof the Committee on Appropriations for helping bring the bill out of \ncommittee. It was brought out unanimously.\n  I especially thank the ranking member of the committee and the senior \nSenator from the State of West Virginia, but also the senior Senator in \nthe Senate, Senator Byrd, for his support and efforts as ranking member \nnot only of this subcommittee but of the full committee, of course, and \nhis role in authoring and designing this bill. It has been very \nconstructive. Obviously, he does not agree with everything in it. That \nis inevitable, especially with the allocation we were equipped with, \nbut his help has been significant in moving the bill forward.\n  I also thank Senator Cochran who, once again, has been extremely \ntolerant of this subcommittee--not only tolerant but supportive. He was \nput in a very difficult position by the administration in the manner in \nwhich they sent up their budget in this area, in that they put in a \nplug number of about $1.4 billion, a number that everyone knew was not \ngoing anywhere. They knew it wasn't going anywhere when they sent it up \nhere. It didn't go anywhere last year when they sent the same number up \nhere, a number they claimed they could support by increasing the fees \non airline travel, and then\n\n[[Page S7272]]\n\ntaking those moneys and putting them to the border. It was a concept \nwhich has been rejected by the Congress before. They knew it would be \nrejected this time.\n  They used it basically as a stalking horse to claim expenditures \nwhich were not then supported by funding. The reason it is not \nsupported is that it makes no sense to raise the fee on airline \npassengers for security purposes on airlines and then take that money \nand put it into the border activity. We have significant fees on \nairline passengers today. That money is used primarily for TSA and FAA \nin order to assist in making sure our air traffic is secure. It is an \nappropriate fee. An increase at this time, which is not related to \nairline traffic, makes little sense.\n  Senator Cochran was confronted with a situation with this bill where \nhe basically had to find about $1.4 billion in order to reach the \nPresident's level of funding, that the President asked for Homeland \nSecurity without any real way to do that except to take it from other \naccounts. He was very generous with this committee. He was not able to \ndo the full amount, but he did a significant amount, and we very much \nappreciate his support. He used to be chairman of the subcommittee when \nit first started and he understands the needs.\n  The issue of the Homeland Security Department is almost a Dickins \nstory because it takes a lot of twists and turns. Some of it is not \nvery pretty. Some of it is good. Some of it is not. The problem we have \nis that the Department was put together in haste. A lot of different \nagencies that had a lot of different cultures, some of which were doing \ntheir tasks very well--such as the Coast Guard and the Secret Service--\nwere put into the Department, and others which had always had a \nproblem, a structural problem such as immigration, were put into the \nDepartment. Then new responsibility was put on the Department with a \nnew focus.\n  Every agency theoretically within the Department is primarily focused \non the issue of national security and protecting us from an attack such \nas September 11, but within the agency, in order to have continuity of \nactivity, there were departments put into it which did not have as \ntheir primary purpose Homeland Security.\n  The most significant example of that, of course, is FEMA, which \nbasically deals with disasters. Most of the disasters it deals with \ninvolve natural disasters, which obviously are not a function of \nterrorist activity, although it is, obviously, also a lead agency \nshould we have a terrorist event such as occurred on September 11. FEMA \nplayed a major role there and did a very good job, by the way. FEMA's \nmanagement of post-September 11 issues was handled with excellence.\n  The Department has a lot of different functions within it. It has now \nbeen going for about 3\\1/2\\ years. I have had the good fortune to chair \nthis committee for about 2 years. It is pretty obvious the Department \nhas not yet shaken out all the problems it has. In fact, the problems \nkeep coming at us relative to management.\n  I asked my staff to take a look at the Department and all the reviews \nthat have been done by outside groups which we basically sanction, such \nas the Inspector General and the GAO and other accounting agencies \nwhich go in and take a look at functions of the Federal Government and \nconclude whether those functions are being done well.\n\n  Homeland Security probably leads the Government in the number of \nreviews that have been done because it is a new agency and because \nthere are problems obviously. I asked my staff to put together a list \nof all the different reviews and tie those lists to the management \nchart of the Department so that we could see just how much the \nDepartment has and has not accomplished in the area of reviews. It \nbecame an overwhelming task. They put together the chart, but there \nwere so many reviews that had occurred that essentially they had to \njust summarize by numbers the different reviews.\n  This is the management chart of the Department of Homeland Security. \nFor example, there have been seven reviews of the chief financial \nofficer. All of them have concluded system failures. The Under \nSecretary for Management has had eight reviews that have concluded a \nlack of plan; six reviews, systems management failures; and one review \nthat said there was a mismanagement of funds.\n  Regarding the Chief Information Officer, the conclusion is that IT \nmanagement has been lacking in 18 different reviews.\n  On and on it goes. Of course, the grand prize winner, regrettably, is \nFEMA, which has had 180 major reviews by GAO or the inspector general \nor other sources of significant credibility--180 reviews have concluded \nthe process has failed, and 7 reviews have concluded that management \ncontrols have failed. In fact, there is such a current problem of \nmismanagement and ineptness that this chart cannot be kept up to date, \nregrettably.\n  Just today we have gotten our most recent review, again, by the \nGovernment Accounting Office. They conclude with the US VISIT Program: \nContract management and oversight for the Visitor and Immigration \nStatus Program needs to be strengthened. This is US VISIT, an \nabsolutely critical program we have. We have had six reviews of US \nVISIT of this depth, and all of them have concluded there are \nsignificant concerns.\n  To take an example of the depth of the problem with this Department, \nagency by agency, there was a review of Federal Protective Services \nwhich basically said they lacked strategic planning, that they had no \nstructure for strategic planning in July of 2004, that they needed to \nenter into an immediate understanding with GSA as to what they should \nbe doing relative to planning and how they should be resolving billing \nissues within that Department. On and on the report went, with very \nspecific ideas as to how to improve the Department.\n  As of today, virtually nothing has happened in the Federal Protective \nServices Agency to try to correct the problems enumerated in the 2004 \nGAO report.\n  What is the result of that? The result is that the Federal Protective \nServices Agency has a $42 million structural deficit, which they do not \nhave any idea how they will correct.\n  That is just one slice of this overall pie which, regrettably, is the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. This is not to say that the Department \ndoes not have very conscientious, hard-working, dedicated public \nservants. It does. It has a panoply of them--those folks who are on the \nfront lines on the border, whether they are immigration officers or \nborder agents, the people in TSA who are working very hard to try to \nstraighten out the lines in the airport and still provide security, the \nSecret Service, the Coast Guard, FEMA people trying to answer the \nproblems of a small flood or issues with what happened in New Orleans. \nThese people are all working very hard, but there is a systematic \nfailure within this Department which is massive. It is, unfortunately, \npermeating the entire Department. It has to be of significant concern \nto us as a Congress.\n  Just a recent report estimated that maybe as much as $18 billion--\nthat is a staggering number--$18 billion of the money we spent on \nKatrina has been misallocated, they believe fraudulently handled, but, \nclearly, it did not get the results they were supposed to get. Whether \nit was a trailer sitting in a field somewhere that never got used or \nwhether it was debit cards used to buy bedding, the fact is that is \npotentially $18 billion.\n  I cannot believe the number is that big. I think that has to be an \noverestimate. There is no way that size number could have been \nmismanaged. But say it is half; say it is $9 billion. Do you know what \nwe could do with $9 billion in this country today? We could do a lot of \ngood things. Just in this Department alone, if we had $9 billion \nfocused on the Coast Guard and on Border Patrol and immigration, an \ninfusion of that type of money--I had to pull teeth to get an extra \n$1.9 billion in the last supplemental. If we got $9 billion, we could \nmake sure our borders were secure and no one could come into the \ncountry illegally. The number of people coming into the country \nillegally would dry up if we had those resources for the borders. It is \na real issue with real implications.\n  All the reports are not just paper documents. They all mean \ntaxpayers' dollars are not being used effectively.\n\n[[Page S7273]]\n\nEven though the people on the front lines are trying their hardest, \nthere are issues that have to be addressed. The main thing we are \nsaying to this agency, this Department--and I know they are trying \nhard, I know the Secretary is trying hard, everyone down there is \ntrying hard--somehow we have to get ahold of this. We have to get some \nmanagement structure so we do not get this constant flow of failure, of \nreview.\n  The way this committee has tried to do it is essentially to try to \nprioritize. We essentially said: There are some things we have to do \nright. Even in the context of all these problems we have, we have to do \nsome things right. The first thing we have to do right is to address \nthe threat. The threat, obviously, is weapons of mass destruction. The \npotential of a weapon of mass destruction being used in America is the \nsingle biggest threat we have as a nation today. It is real.\n  It is regrettable that there are a number of people in the country, \nespecially the press, who do not take it seriously, but it is a serious \nproblem which we have as a nation because there are, unfortunately, \npeople out there who are fundamentally evil who genuinely believe their \nway to a fuller life and a great existence is to essentially kill \nhundreds, potentially thousands, of Americans and try to destroy \nWestern culture. That is their purpose. These people are sophisticated. \nThey have the capacity, if given the wherewithal, to use a weapon that \ncould do massive damage to our Nation. We cannot underestimate this \nthreat simply because we have gotten through 4 years.\n  Let me congratulate those who work on the front line. As I said, \nthere are some hard-working, committed people. Four years of hard work \nhave kept us free from an attack, and that, I guess, is the bottom \nline. So maybe my statement before was a bit harsh because you have to \ncongratulate the success in the fact that we have not been attacked in \nthe last 4 years. But the documentation is also real that we have real \nissues with this Department. But if we are to continue to be successful \nin thwarting a weapon of mass destruction attack, we must put resources \nin those areas. But they must be used effectively.\n  We have the Science and Technology Directorate of this group. They \nhave no plan, as far as we can tell. They want more money, and I would \nbe happy to give them more money. I would be enthusiastic about putting \nmore money into their operations if I felt there was some sort of \ncoherent plan as to what they were going to do with those funds. In \nfact, it is just the opposite. You get just the opposite feeling from \nthe Science and Technology Directorate.\n  You have the NMDS, the nuclear detection group, which is working \nhard. They are up and running in Nevada. They are trying to develop \nsystems. Well, they started from nothing. Basically, they wanted a lot \nof money to get started. We asked that they give us some directions as \nto how they were going to do that, and they have started to do that. So \nthey are moving on the right path. But what we basically said is: We \nwill give you the money as you produce the plan that produces the \nresults.\n  We have to be ready for a domestic nuclear event, and we have to try \nto stop it before it happens. But it also has to be done in a coherent \nand comprehensive way rather than an illogical way or in a way that \nappears to be haphazard. There is progress being made there. That is \nwhere we want to focus our dollars, quite honestly. We want to focus \nour dollars in this effort. I have been joined by Senator Byrd in \ntrying to address the weapons of mass destruction threat. That is the \nNo. 1 thing.\n  The second thing we want to focus on and we have tried to focus on is \nthe issue of border security because you really have to know who is \ncoming into the country if you are going to be able to claim you have \naddressed the issue of threat. Because, sure, there are homegrown \nterrorists in America, unfortunately. There is no question about it. \nBut we also know there are an awful lot of people out there--and we saw \nit again just this week--primarily coming out of the Mideast but also \nout of Southeast Asia, who want to do us harm and whose purpose is to \ndo us harm--and they are open about it--- who have put out epistles to \ntheir followers that their cause should be to attack America and \nAmericans within and outside of our country.\n  So we really need to know who is coming across our borders. And then, \nof course, we have the secondary issue, which is we have a large number \nof people coming into our country illegally who wish us no harm. In \nfact, it is just the opposite. They wish to take advantage of the \nAmerican dream, to get a job and support their families. They come here \nto get work--and especially across the southern border--but they are \ncoming here illegally, and that is not appropriate. So we need to get \ncontrol over our borders.\n  So about 2 years ago, when I took over this job, of being in charge \nof this committee, we started to ramp up significantly our commitment \nto border security. With this bill, should this bill be successful and \nbe passed, we will have increased the number of border agents by 40 \npercent; we will have increased the number of detention beds by about \n30 percent; we will have dramatically increased our commitment to the \nCoast Guard; we will have dramatically increased our commitment to ICE; \nand we will have put in place and started up the US-VISIT Program, \nwhich I still have reservations about as to how effective it is going \nto be, but it seems to be moving in the right direction and people are \nworking hard on it. Our purpose has been to retool the borders so we \ncan be sure within a few years we can control the borders.\n  Now, I happen to be of the belief that we should put this on the fast \ntrack. It should not be 5 years from now, it should be next year. But \nthat has not happened, primarily because of resources. However, we have \nmade dramatic strides in this area.\n  Now, there has been a disagreement here between ourselves and the \nadministration on this point. In fact, when we brought our first budget \nforward, which significantly increased the number of border agents by \nabout 1,000--actually 1,500 when you coupled the supplemental with the \nbill--we were strongly resisted by the administration because we took \nmoney out of other accounts--primarily State and local first responder \nfunds--and moved it over to Border Patrol. We did the same thing to add \nthe detention beds. That was done with the support of the Senate and, \nin the end, with the support of the House. That was a success. It was \nsuch a success, in fact, that now the administration claims it was \ntheir idea, even though at the time they opposed it.\n  Now, we have tried to move forward. This year, we put $1.9 billion \ninto the supplemental to try to address the capital needs of the border \nissue, such as the aircraft, the fact that our aircraft we are flying \ndown there are 40 years over their useful life, the helicopters are 20 \nyears over their useful life; the fact that the Coast Guard is on a \nprogram of building coastal security capability, but it is on a program \nthat won't build out until 2023, and we think that should be \naccelerated to 2015; the fact that we only had one unmanned vehicle on \nthe southern border--or anywhere on the borders, for that matter--and \nthat one unmanned vehicle crashed, and we need to replace it and add \nmore. And we have a lot of technology needs and also just plain old-\nfashioned cars and desks and training capability, things we felt we \nneeded on the capital side.\n\n  Well, as to that idea, although the Congress thought it made sense, \nthe administration did not. They took the number and converted it. We \nare happy to have the money. Initially, the Department was not even \nhappy to have the money, but they took the money, and they converted it \nto operational needs, adding another 1,000 agents, adding another 4,000 \nbeds, adding operational costs, and also some capital needs. I think \nthe helicopters were covered. The planes were not upgraded. There were \nunmanned vehicles that would be purchased. So that was a point of \ndisagreement, but at least we were on the right track.\n  But the practical effect of that bill was we created what is known as \na fiscal tail, which meant that as you added operational costs in the \nsupplemental, you had to add additional money in the main bill in order \nto pay for the operational needs which would be ongoing, which meant \nthat the basic bill was stressed, first because it did not have full \nfunding because of the $1.4 billion hold that was put in it by the \nsetting\n\n[[Page S7274]]\n\nup of a fee system, which everybody knew was not going to work, and \nsecondly because of the tail that came out of this supplemental, which \nmeant we had to pick up about $600 million of cost we had not planned \nto pick up in this bill in order to maintain the costs which had been \nput in the supplemental, which we felt should have, instead, been \ncapital costs rather than operational costs.\n  So the practical effect of that gets us to this bill we have today, \nwhich is a bill which continues the movement toward securing the \nborders but does not do it in as robust a way as I would like. I am not \ngoing to be disingenuous about it. I am not going to come to the floor \nand say this is the greatest thing since sliced bread. It is not. It is \na step in the right direction. And because of Senator Cochran's and \nSenator Byrd's support in getting a bigger allocation in this bill than \nit might have appropriately gotten in light of what was sent up by the \nadministration, it is a fairly significant step. It adds an additional \n1,000 agents. It adds an additional 1,000 detention beds. But that \nmeans we are still short of where we need to be. Even though we have \nincreased agents by 40 percent and detention beds by 30 percent, we are \nstill way short of where we need to be to be able to say, with \nconfidence, we are going to be able to stop the people who are coming \nacross our borders, especially our southern border, in the near term, \ndetain them, and make sure the bad ones are sent back and the other \nfolks are put through some system that works.\n  That brings us to another issue involving border security, which is \nthis whole question of immigration reform. There is no question in my \nmind that you cannot get substantive long-term border control unless \nyou have immigration reform, which means some sort of guest worker \nprogram for people who want to come here and work. People who are \ngetting paid $5 a day in Mexico and can make $50 a day in the United \nStates, who have a family to feed, are going to come to the United \nStates. That is just human nature. That is what they are going to do. \nThat is what they have to do in order to survive and take care of their \nfamilies. We have to come up with a way where those people can come \nacross our borders and we will know who they are, why they are here, \nwhere they are going, and where they are working.\n  Now, the Senate has passed an immigration bill, which I voted for, \nand the House has passed an immigration bill. But the conference \nprocess does not seem to be going forward very well. Well, the bill \nhere, ironically, sets out some parameters which might help move this \nwhole thing along, if we want to do a comprehensive immigration bill.\n  I think there is general consensus developing around here to a \nconcept which was put forward by Senator Isakson of Georgia during the \nimmigration debate that we should have a trigger mechanism, basically, \nwhich would essentially say: When you accomplish these goals in the \narea of border security, then you can move to the next step in the area \nof bringing along a guest worker program.\n  What this bill does is basically give us some pretty specific ideas \nas to what those goals should be. What should be the ascertainable \nstandards which we should set that need to be accomplished and, if and \nwhen accomplished, should kick in a guest worker program? And there are \na couple of ideas of how you approach the guest worker program, but the \nascertainable standards are really pretty obvious. They first should be \ndefinite. They cannot be vague. They cannot be standards which are \ngameable. But if you look at what we need on the border, you do not \nneed vagueness. You can be pretty precise. In fact, you can get right \ndown to the numbers.\n  If we had 20,000 border agents, we know we would have the necessary \nborder agents. If we had about 40,000 detention beds--that doesn't mean \nfirm beds. There are lots of ways to do detention beds. You could use \nold military bases. You could use present military bases. But if you \nhad the capacity to hold up to 40,000 people who come across our \nborders illegally, that would give you the necessary numbers to do the \nprocess. If you had about five to nine UAVs, depending on whether you \nwere going to use UAVs on the northern border, that would be a number \nthat was ascertainable. If you had a Coast Guard build-out which said \nit would be completed by the year 2015, that would be a number that \nwould be ascertainable. Those are numbers you could put in. If you had \na US-VISIT Program that met certain standards, so that when a person \ncomes across the border they get fingerprinted in a way that would \nallow the FBI database to be actually activated in real time, that \nwould be an ascertainable standard. And if you had a readable \nemployment card that had biometrics as its base, that would be an \nascertainable standard.\n  If you just did those items as your ascertainable standards, you \nwould have in place what is necessary to put forward an effective \nborder security commitment. And you could follow that, when those had \nbeen reached--and they could be reached in a very short time if you \nwanted to put the resources in it; this is not years, this could be \nreached very quickly--you could put forward a guest worker program \nwhich could follow on rather quickly. I have ideas as to how the guest \nworker program should work, and other people do, but there certainly is \na way to do it that makes sense and is fair to people who want to come \ninto this country and work for a living, even those who are already \nhere illegally, without creating amnesty. So this bill sets out, \nbasically, parameters for accomplishing that. It gives a path that \ncould be followed to accomplish that goal, and I hope it will be \nsupported for that reason.\n  As I have said, the bill is not everything we need, and the \nDepartment is not clearly where we need to have it. But in the context \nof the resources which were available to us, this bill is very much a \nstep in the right direction. It will add significantly to the number of \nborder agents.\n  It will add significantly to the number of detention beds. When you \ncombine it with the supplemental, there will be 2,000 new border agents \nand 5,000 new beds. It puts in place some of the mechanisms to try to \nmake sure the technology is appropriately addressed.\n  The place where it is most lacking, to be fair in disclosure, is with \nthe Coast Guard because the Coast Guard buildout remains a 2023 \nexercise under this bill versus what should have been a 2015 buildout \nexercise. That is unfortunate. Had we gotten what we needed in the \nsupplemental, we could have changed that. We didn't. So we will come \nback to that issue. I wouldn't be surprised if there are other \nsupplementals floating through here and the Coast Guard has a fair and \nlegitimate claim on funds for national defense in those supplementals; \nif not, in the next appropriations rounds.\n  So that is where we stand today. It is a bill on the right track. It \ndoesn't solve all the problems. It deals with an agency which is trying \nhard, with good people, committed to the purpose of protecting us but \nan agency which has very significant issues of management and systems \ncontrols.\n  I appreciate the courtesy of the Senate in listening to me for this \nlength of time. I especially appreciate the courtesy of the Senator \nfrom West Virginia for his constructive efforts and his help in \nbringing the legislation this far.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate has before it the fiscal year \n2007 Homeland Security appropriations bill. I commend our chairman. I \nam debating whether I should say ``who has no peer.'' I think I will \nstick with that. He has no peer when it comes to knowledge of the \nsubject matter and as one who cares deeply about his country, his \ncommittee, its work, and about the needs that exist for appropriating \nadequate funds. I commend him. I commend his staff. They have done \nexcellent work on this legislation.\n  This chairman makes it his business to know what are the facts \nconcerning the needs out there; who makes it his business, once he \nknows the facts, to go after the weaknesses, the soft spots, and, with \na great determination, to do the task ahead.\n  I commend the thousands of men and women who are on the front lines \ndefending America's homeland. They do serve the Nation every hour of \nevery day. Senator Gregg has tried to allocate limited--and I say \nlimited, I stress\n\n[[Page S7275]]\n\nthe word ``limited''--resources to respond to those threats that \npresent the greatest risk. He does not have the funds to deal with all \nthe threats, but he has sought to respond to those threats that present \nthe greatest risk. In doing so, Senator Gregg has included a number of \nimprovements to the President's budget, particularly with regard to \nborder security, baggage explosives detention, fire grants, and \nemergency management. However, there is a limitation to the ability of \nthis chairman, or any chairman--a limitation to the ability of the \nAppropriations Committee--to address the problems in the President's \nbudget.\n  The bill is $515 million below the President's request, and only 4 \npercent higher than last year. There are funding shortfalls for port \nsecurity, border security, rail security, and first responder grants. \nThese shortcomings are largely a result of the administration's ill-\nconsidered proposal for the Appropriations Committees to enact an \nincrease in the aviation passenger tax. While the President claims \ncredit for a robust budget for securing our borders, his actual budget \nis hollow, hollow, hollow. The White House knew when it sent the budget \nto the Congress that the funding relied on a tax hike on air \ntravelers--a tax hike that the Congress had already rejected. How about \nthat.\n  The Appropriations Committees lack jurisdiction to increase the \naviation passenger tax and, of course, we could not do so in this bill. \nAs a result of the President's proposal, the funding for homeland \nsecurity in this bill is not only lean, it is also very lean. So I \nagain commend Chairman Gregg for his masterful work in putting together \nthis bill, but serious security problems remain.\n  The Department of Homeland Security is now in its fourth year of \nexistence, as Senator Gregg has explained. While many of its legacy \nagencies, such as the Coast Guard, Customs and Border Protection, and \nthe Secret Service, continue to operate effectively, the Department \nitself certainly has become the gang that can't shoot straight. Nearly \n5 years after 9/11, key issues, such as fixing FEMA, such as \nestablishing chemical security standards, such as inspecting cargo on \ncommercial aircraft and inspecting air passengers for explosives, such \nas securing our ports and making sure that State and local governments \nhave effective mass evacuation plans, are all languishing at the \nDepartment. The list of issues that are festering at the Department \ngoes on and on, and these problems are not merely bureaucratic hassles. \nThese are issues that imperil the safety of Americans--Americans--as \nthey go about their daily lives. That is you and you and you and you \nout there in the plains, the prairies, the Rockies, the Alleghenies, \nyou citizens, the safety of you citizens as you go about your daily \nlives.\n  Only 5 percent of the 11 million cargo containers coming into this \ncountry are opened for inspection. We know that terrorists desire to \nbring a dirty bomb into this country. Over 6 billion pounds of cargo is \nplaced on commercial airlines each year, and virtually none of that \ncargo is inspected. How about that. Do you feel any safer? How do you \nfeel about that, now that I have said that?\n  The Environmental Protection Agency reports that 123 chemical plants \nlocated throughout the Nation--and in particular in the Kanawha Valley \nin southern West Virginia--could each potentially expose more than a \nmillion people if a chemical release occurred. How does that make you \nfeel? Yet according to the Government Accountability Office, only 1,100 \nof the 15,000 chemical facilities in this country are known to comply \nwith voluntary security standards. Yet the administration has done \nvirtually nothing to either require compliance or create incentives for \nthe chemical industry to secure its facilities. Only 37 of the 448 \nairports in this country have acquired new technology to inspect \nairline passengers for explosives as they board airplanes. Does that \nmake you nervous when you go up to the ticket counter to buy a plane \nticket?\n  There are in this country, in prisons, more than 550,000 criminal \naliens in prisons in this country who have not been identified by the \nDepartment for removal from the country. Does that make you feel any \nsafer? How about that. When they get out of prison, they may be walking \nthe streets in your neighborhood. Where? In your neighborhood. They \nneed to be removed from this country as soon as they finish their \nprison terms.\n  The so-called millennium bomber crossed the U.S.-Canadian border in \nWashington State intending to blow up the control tower at Los Angeles \nInternational Airport. Just last month, 17 homegrown--get that, 17 \nhomegrown--alleged terrorists were arrested in Toronto. Yet there are \nonly 1,000 Border Patrol agents stationed along the northern border. \nThat means that one lonely Border Patrol agent is responsible for \npatrolling 5.5 miles of the border.\n  Nearly 5 years after 9/11, most of our first responders still do not \nhave interoperable communications equipment.\n  Can you believe that? Nearly 5 years after 9/11, most of our first \nresponders still do not have interoperable communications equipment. \nCan you believe that? I have pressed for that most basic need for our \nfirst responders for nearly 5 years. This subcommittee is on top of its \nwork, but it needs more resources.\n  We all learned after Hurricane Katrina that FEMA is no longer up to \nthe task of responding to a catastrophic disaster, whether the disaster \nis a terrorist attack or a natural disaster. According to the \nadministration's own statistics, only 27 percent of State and 10 \npercent of urban area plans were rated as adequate to cope with a \ncatastrophic event.\n  In addition to failing to address known vulnerabilities, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security is turning into a case study for failed \nmanagement. The GAO and the DHS inspector general have documented \nnumerous financial management and procurement failures at the \nDepartment. The Department of Homeland Security information systems are \nnot secure. The GAO alone has completed 494 evaluations of DHS \nprograms. The DHS Office of the Inspector General is spread so thinly \nthat it was unable to follow through on 616 different allegations of \nwrongdoing last year.\n  The Department continues to allow valuable homeland security dollars \nto gather dust in the Treasury rather than getting the money out to \nState and local governments where the money can actually be used to \nsecure our ports and mass-transit systems or to purchase interoperable \ncommunications equipment.\n  In the fiscal year 2006 Homeland Security appropriations report, we \ndirected the Department to send Congress a report by February 10 \nproviding an expedited schedule for awarding homeland security grants. \nLast week, 5 months late, we got the report. The report detailed the \nDepartment's plan to award 20 different grant programs in the last \nmonth of the fiscal year. Congress approved funds last October, yet the \nfunds will sit here in Washington for almost a year. Last week was the \n1-year anniversary of the London train bombing. Yet under the \nDepartment's plan rail and transit security funding that was \nappropriated by Congress last October will not be awarded until this \nSeptember. The same malaise applies to grants to secure our ports, our \nbuses, for securing buffer zones around nuclear and electrical plants, \nand grants to hire more firefighters. What is the administration \nwaiting for? Does there have to be another horrendous attack with \nthousands of deaths before this Department will shake out of its nearly \ncomatose state?\n  The Department's record should cause every citizen--that is you and \nyou and you and you--alarm. The Department's record should cause every \ncitizen alarm. It is a record that was entirely predictable. While I \nsupported the creation of a Department of Homeland Security, I voted \nagainst the legislation that created this unwieldy behemoth. In \nconsolidating 22 agencies into 1 department, the Congress created an \norganization that was destined from the beginning to have failures. \nThis was a department that was created out of political expediency in \nthe basement of the White House, not through careful analysis.\n  In the months following 9/11, the President feared that the Congress \nwas taking the initiative on securing the homeland. So the President \ndirected a small White House team, cloaked in secrecy in the bowels of \nthe White House, to draft a reorganization of homeland security \nagencies. No security experts\n\n[[Page S7276]]\n\nwere present. The political wizards conjured up this witch's brew. The \nresult was a massive governmental reorganization rushed through the \nCongress in a matter of months. Do you remember that? I remember it. I \nexpressed my concerns about it.\n  As I said in the fall of 2002--did you get that--in the fall of 2002, \n4 years ago:\n\n       If we take this giant step, our homeland defense system \n     will likely be in a state of chaos for the next few years.\n       People may begin to read in the newspapers about startup \n     problems in this vast new Department. These kinds of high-\n     profile debacles could carry over to the Transportation \n     Security Administration, the Customs Service, FEMA, the Coast \n     Guard, or any of the agencies.\n\n  That is what I said.\n  For this administration, the illusion of security--like seeing a \nwaterfall in the desert, an illusion--created by this Department and \nspawned in the White House cellar was more important than a careful \nplan for actually making Americans safer. Perhaps I should say that \nagain. For this administration, the illusion of security created by \nthis Department and spawned in the White House cellar was more \nimportant than a careful plan for actually making Americans safer. For \nthis administration, it is OK to do homeland security on the cheap. For \nyears, I have come to this floor, and others have come to this floor, \nand documented examples of the ways in which the administration \nrelegates homeland security to a low priority--border security, rail \nand transit security, port security, chemical security, funds for \nfirefighters, and the list goes on and on.\n\n  This year, the administration proposed to cut the firefighter grant \nprogram by 45 percent. It was proposed to eliminate the SAFER Program, \na congressional initiative that helps local governments hire more \nfirefighters. The Department failed to transmit to the Congress the \nstatutorily mandated needs assessment of our firefighters. I wonder \nwhether the report is locked in someone's desk because it concluded \nthat our fire departments still lack the resources necessary to \npurchase equipment capable of responding to a terrorist attack.\n  Nearly 5 years after 9/11 and nearly 1 year after Hurricane Katrina \nproved that our first responders are not ready to deal with a \ncatastrophic disaster, the President proposes to cut first responder \ngrants by 13 percent below fiscal year 2006 and 33 percent below fiscal \nyear 2005.\n  There is another example of the rob-Peter-to-pay-Paul approach the \nadministration takes to securing our homeland. Last week, the \nadministration notified the Congress of a serious shortfall within the \nFederal Protective Service, the agency that secures over 1 million \nFederal employees and visitors to our Federal buildings. Rather than \nrequest additional funding for the shortfall or increase the fees \ncharged to Federal agencies to cover the shortfall, the administration \nis proposing that we cut funding for explosives countermeasures and for \ndetaining and removing illegal aliens to pay for the shortfall. Can you \nimagine that? The President tells the Nation that border security is a \ncritical priority for our national security--and he is right, that is \nwhat it is. The President pushes the Congress to get tough on illegal \nimmigration, and then his administration proposes to cut funding for \ndetaining and removing illegal aliens. And in a world where we see \nexplosions of improvised explosive devices killing American soldiers \nevery day and with the Madrid and London train bombings, the \nadministration wants to cut funds for developing explosives \ncountermeasures here in the United States. What kind of confusion \nreigns at the other end of the avenue, at the White House? Does \nPresidential rhetoric now excuse rolling the dice with the safety of \nmillions of Americans?\n  Today, the Senate has before it the fourth Homeland Security \nappropriations bill that the Senate has considered since the Department \nwas created. Under the leadership of the first chairman of the \nsubcommittee, Thad Cochran, and under the leadership of the current \nchairman, Senator Judd Gregg, the Senate has striven to provide the \nDepartment with the resources it needs to do its job and to give clear \ndirection for improving its efforts to secure the homeland. And it has \nbeen an uphill fight.\n  I am pleased that, in this bill, Chairman Judd Gregg included a \nnumber of provisions that will improve the operations of the Department \nof Homeland Security. I hope that the administration downtown will \nlisten to his lead and that the administration will follow his lead.\n  Hardly a week goes by that the administration does not remind \nAmericans of the continuing threat of terrorist attacks. As we debate \nthe bill this week, I will offer two amendments to fill some of the \ngaps in border security and port security that were created as a result \nof the administration's unworkable proposal to finance $1.2 billion of \nthe Department's budget through increased aviation passenger taxes. I \nwill also support amendments that will be offered to increase funding \nfor first responders and for rail and transit security. I encourage \nCongress to demand more of the Department of Homeland Security and more \nthan rhetoric from the President.\n  Again, I applaud Chairman Gregg for the expertise he brings to the \nbill, for the labor he expends, for his determination, his concern, and \nfor the foresightedness he brings to the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the kind comments of the \nSenator from West Virginia. I especially appreciate his very insightful \nreview of the issues here, most of which I agree with, some of which I \nmay have some disagreement with, but mostly I am in total agreement. He \nused the analogy of a hill. I sometimes feel that he and I are like \nSisyphus on this hill. I am not sure we are going to make it to the \ntop, because they keep pushing the stone back down on us.\n\n  In any event, the effort is being made. We are trying to secure our \nborders and make sure that we are safer from weapons of mass \ndestruction. And the Department, as he said--and I think it is \nimportant to stress this--is filled with people conscientious and \ncommitted to protecting America, and the issues which are raised are \nones of resources and systems and support. Those can be resolved when \nyou have good people working, and I think we can resolve them.\n  I look forward to hearing more from the Senator as he brings forward \nhis amendments.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the committee substitute to H.R. 5441 be \nconsidered and agreed to; provided that no points of order are waived \nthereon and that the measure, as amended, be considered original text \nfor purpose of further amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened to my colleague from West \nVirginia in his description of amendments he intends to offer. It is a \ndescription of the legislation. This Appropriations subcommittee is a \nvery important subcommittee and raises a good many issues dealing with \nthe security of our country. I want to talk about them briefly, and \nthen I want to talk about something that occurred last week.\n  First, with respect to homeland security, a book was written a while \nback about October 11, 2001. We talk about September 11, 2001. On 9/11/\n2001, a tragedy was visited on this country when airplanes loaded with \nfuel crashed into the Trade Centers, the Pentagon, and a field in \nPennsylvania, and thousands died. It was a devastating terrorist attack \nagainst our country. That was on 9/11/2001.\n  According to information in a book printed some while ago, on October \n11 of that same year, a CIA agent with a code name Dragonfire reported, \nand apparently through the Presidential daily briefings, the head of \nthe CIA, Mr. Tenet, reported to the President, that they had picked up \na rumor or intelligence had gathered information that a 10-kiloton \nnuclear weapon had been stolen from the Soviet arsenal, or the Russian \narsenal, and had been taken to New York City and was to be detonated in \na major American city by a terrorist organization.\n  Graham Allison, who wrote the book ``Nuclear Terrorism,'' described \nthe\n\n[[Page S7277]]\n\nplot that was told to the CIA by an agent called Dragonfire. As a \nresult of that description 1 month after 9/11 that there might be a 10-\nkiloton Russian nuclear weapon in this country already set to be \ndetonated in an American major city, there was great concern, \nobviously. Many people were apoplectic about what was happening. This \ndid not become the product of news stories, for obvious reasons. But \nthe administration and others responded to it with some concern.\n  About a month later, it was apparently discerned that this was not a \ncredible threat, or at least the circumstances that brought that threat \nwere not credible. But as they post-mortemed that period, they \ndiscovered it was probably perfectly credible: We know the Russians had \n10-kiloton nuclear weapons; they had built them. They don't have the \nbest command and control of their nuclear weapons. It is perfectly \nplausible that someone might have stolen or purchased a 10-kiloton \nnuclear weapon and it was not outside the scope of probability that \nsomeone might have brought a nuclear weapon into this country and a \nterrorist organization could well have detonated a nuclear weapon, all \nof which caused great concern.\n  We have roughly 30,000 strategic and tactical nuclear weapons in this \nworld. The disappearance of one to a terrorist organization, in the \nhands of a terrorist organization will cause a terrorist act in a major \ncity unlike any we have ever seen.\n  It is interesting that when the Defense authorization bill comes to \nthe floor of the Senate, we spend billions and billions of dollars \ndefending against a rogue nation or a terrorist acquiring a nuclear \nweapon, putting it on the tip of an intercontinental ballistic missile \nand shooting it at our country at 18,000 miles an hour. So we are \nspending billions on an antiballistic missile system to try to hit a \nbullet with a bullet. It is my judgment--and I think the judgment of \nmost people who evaluate what is the most likely threat against our \ncountry--that the most likely threat is a container ship pulling up to \na dock at a seaport in this country at about 3 miles with a container \non board, with a weapon of mass destruction inside that container that \nhas not been inspected. That is a far more likely threat to this \ncountry than a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile \nacquired by a rogue nation or a terrorist organization. Yet we are \nspending thousands of times more money on the antiballistic missile \nprogram than we are on port security.\n  It is why port security is of such great importance to this country. \nWe have a large border, and we had some discussion with respect to the \nimmigration bill about border security--border security with respect to \nimmigration, yes, but also with respect to keeping terrorists out. But \nour borders not only include the landmass between Mexico and the U.S. \nand Canada and the U.S, our borders include port facilities and a \nsubstantial number--I believe the number is close to 6 million \ncontainers on ships each year come into this country, with a very small \npercentage of them actually investigated or inspected. That is why port \nsecurity is so very important.\n  It is also the case, as my colleague from West Virginia has \ndescribed, that first responders in this country will almost inevitably \nbe first to respond to not only a terrorist act should one occur in the \nfuture, but first responders will likely be first in contact with the \nterrorists. It is a fact that one of the terrorists who flew an \nairplane into a building in this country on 9/11/2001 was apprehended \nfor speeding in the State of Maryland but apparently was not on a \nwatchlist and so was given a speeding ticket and then drove off.\n\n  It is likely that the first acquaintance with a terrorist or a \nterrorist act will be someone in local government--local police, county \nsheriff, a local emergency crew, an ambulance. That is the first \nresponder.\n  We have just had testimony from sheriffs and local police officers \nabout the issue of critical interoperability of communications. Is the \nlocal police organization able to communicate with the highway patrol? \nCan the highway patrol communicate with the fire department? Can the \npolice communicate with the fire department? All of that is very \nimportant. Yet at the same time we ask these questions, the President \nis recommending very substantial cuts in these programs--Byrne grants, \nlaw enforcement block grants, COPS Program, and others. It is exactly \nthe wrong time, in my judgment, to retreat. At the same time violent \ncrime is increasing, by the way, the President is recommending those \nsame cuts.\n  With respect to this issue of the Department of Homeland Security, it \nis very important we get it right. My colleague, Senator Judd Gregg, I \nknow works hard on these issues, as does my colleague from West \nVirginia, Senator Byrd. I hope this week, as we work our way through \nthis legislation, we can thoughtfully consider amendments and evaluate \nthose that will strengthen this bill and perhaps discard those that \nwill not we will come out of it with legislation that will give us the \nfeeling that we have improved substantially homeland security in our \ncountry.\n  Homeland security is also about hometown security because that is \nwhere homeland security starts--with first responders.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness. I would like to speak for a few minutes about a drought tour \nI took last week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Agriculture Disaster Relief\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we have a portion of North Dakota, and it \nextends down into South Dakota, parts of Missouri, Illinois, all the \nway down to Texas, where a very severe drought is occurring. I want to \ntalk about meetings in Flasher, ND, Moffit, ND, and Zeeland, ND. \nZeeland is a town of 118 people. I drove up to Zeeland the other day \nand 170 farmers and ranchers were there, in a town of 118 people. As we \ndrove into that town and looked off to the left, we saw what looks like \nthe gravel infield or sand infield of a baseball diamond, a field that \nis supposed to have grass where cows can graze. There is no grass. It \nlooks like a bowling ball. That is because there is a devastating \ndrought occurring in that region.\n  We have a lot of folks who have cattle, and you either feed cattle or \nyou have to sell them. It is just that simple. People are very \nconcerned.\n  No. 1, we need hay and grazing opened on CRP land so farmers can get \nat forage to feed these cows. I had people stand up at meetings and \nsay: I have 200 to 300 cows, and I have nothing to feed them. The \npasture is bare.\n  Those cows are either going to be fed or put on a truck and sent to \nmarket immediately.\n  There was a man, Wes Mastel, a 24-year-old rancher who just started 2 \nyears ago. He had to sell his herd of 114 cows. He had nothing to feed \nthem. The stories are pretty devastating.\n  The thermometer on the MacIntosh County Bank the other day read 100, \n101 degrees with wind just drying out the soil, sucking out the \nmoisture--what little moisture that does exist in the soil.\n  We have this developing, abiding drought that is devastating to \nranchers. I raise the question because I have offered three times now \ndisaster relief for 2006 when we had torrential rains and 2 million \nacres couldn't be planted or were planted and washed away completely.\n  We had a disaster in the gulf region. That was called Katrina. The \ntorrential rains in North Dakota didn't have a name, but they were \ntorrential rains. They destroyed crops. The drought doesn't have a \nname. It destroys crops.\n  The question is: What can we do about it? We have always, prior to \nthis, reached out to family farmers and said: We want to help you; in \ntimes of trouble, we want to help.\n  Last December, the Senate passed a disaster relief bill. The House \nwould not accept it. The President, in fact, very frontally said: If it \ncomes to me, I will veto it. Usually it is a Presidential adviser who \nrecommends a veto. That wasn't the case. The President said: I will \nveto it, so it didn't go anywhere.\n  A couple of months ago on the emergency supplemental, I attached, \nonce again, a disaster relief bill. It got to conference with the \nHouse, and it was again jettisoned. The President again said he opposed \nit.\n  So I attached a disaster relief bill to the Agriculture \nappropriations bill that was marked up in the full committee just \nrecently. We are going to\n\n[[Page S7278]]\n\nsee again. Times change, things change. My hope is the President will \nunderstand this is a very serious problem and will relent and decide he \nwants to help.\n  I am informing the chairman and ranking member of the full \nAppropriations Committee today that it is my intention to modify the \namendment I added to the Agriculture appropriations bill to include the \n2006 drought because we must, it seems to me, respond to this \ndisaster. The failure to respond to it means that fewer and fewer \npeople will be living out on the land in this country, and that takes \nsomething significant away from the character of this country. This is \nnot new. We have always reached out in times of trouble.\n\n  I would ask anybody who thinks there is not trouble out there to just \ntake a drive--take a drive in the drought area and then ask yourself, \nif you had 300 cows that were your responsibility on your ranch, what \non Earth would you feed them? And if there is nothing to feed them, you \nare going to market and you are out of business. It is that simple.\n  So, first and foremost, my colleague, Senator Conrad, and I, and \nothers, have asked the Secretary of Agriculture to release haying and \ngrazing opportunities on CRP lands. That is very important. It is \nimportant that it be done now, not later. The Department of Agriculture \nalways drags its feet and always opens CRP land for haying and grazing \ntoo late, after the major 4-H opportunities are gone or after the 4-H \ncapability is dramatically diminished. So my hope is that the Secretary \nof Agriculture will heed the call this time and open that land for \nhaying and grazing immediately to give some relief to those ranchers.\n  As I said, this is not just about North Dakota. My colleague, Senator \nBond from Missouri, and our colleagues from Illinois and others--\nIllinois, last year, had the third driest year since 1895. There are \nother areas of this country that are suffering the ravages of drought. \nAgain, my hope is that this Congress will understand the urgency.\n  I was at this meeting in Zealand, ND, of 170 ranchers. They talked \nabout the drought. Even without the drought, what is happening to them, \nthe average farmer and rancher in North Dakota is spending $18,000 a \nyear in additional energy costs. The big, major integrated oil \ncompanies are walking to the bank with bundles of money sucked right \nout of the pocketbooks of working Americans, ranchers, and farmers, \nespecially because they are heavy users of energy. It is unbelievable \nthe toll it is imposing all across this country. But when you add a \ndrought, which has destroyed pastures and destroyed the ability to feed \nyour cattle, and then continue to impose this additional burden of \nenergy costs, in my judgment, it is a recipe for destruction all across \nrural America.\n  Some people may think it doesn't matter. I have spoken before to my \ncolleagues about a fellow named Rodney Nelson in North Dakota who is a \ncowboy poet and who wrote a long question for this country: Does part \nof this country's character depend on having folks on the farm and on \nthe ranch as well? Farmers and ranchers, small towns and big towns, \nisn't all of that together part of the character of this country? He \nasked the question: What is it worth? What is it worth for a kid to \nknow how to weld a seam? What is it worth for a kid to know how to \noverhaul a tractor, how to plow a straight furrow, how to teach a calf \nto suck from a pail? What is it worth for a kid to know all of these \nthings? What is it worth for a kid to know how to grease a combine, how \nto hang a door, how to build a lean-to? What is it worth?\n  There is only one university in this country where that is taught and \nthat is on the family farm. Those kids who come off our farms and go to \nsmall towns and big cities, who bring with them that nourishment of \nfamily values from America's farms and ranches to small towns and big \ncities is what renews our country. If this Congress ever decides that \nfarms don't matter, those Americans who live out under a yard light \ntrying to raise a family and raise a crop and raise some livestock, if \nthis Congress ever decides they don't matter, we will have lost \nsomething very substantial for this country.\n  So for now, we need the Secretary of Agriculture immediately to \nrelease CRP land for haying and grazing so we can get some feed to \nthose cattle in drought areas, No. 1. No. 2, we need this President to \nback away from his threat to veto disaster aid, and we need to amend \nthe provision that I put in the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee \nto extend it to 2006, which I intend to do.\n  Mr. President, we have a lot of choices to make in this country. Our \ncountry has a responsibility in this world to respond to all kinds of \nthings. We are a world leader. I think that it is important for us to \nrespond around the world. But first and foremost, it is important for \nus to respond here at home and take care of things here at home.\n  I am just telling you when the sign at the bank and the sign downtown \nin your town shows 105 degrees or 102 degrees and the wind is blowing \n30 miles an hour and the pasture looks like a bowling ball and there is \nnothing for the cattle to eat and you are suffering through a drought, \nthis Congress has a responsibility to act--and sooner rather than \nlater.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/10/senate-section/article/S7278-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, I will take the first 10 minutes to speak \nabout the recent Supreme Court decision on the treatment of terrorists \nwe are holding and their rights relative to trial. This is a classic \nexample of a court that has seen the trees but has failed to see the \nforest.\n  We are confronted with a situation where individuals, whose purpose \nit is to kill Americans and destroy our Nation, are being held by our \ncountry in order to protect our country. These are individuals who \ndon't function as part of an organized nation. There is no Nation to \nwhich they are accountable or which would be accountable to us should \nwe be functioning in a state of war that was formal, such as occurred \nduring World War II when the Nazi government and Germany and the German \nsoldiers that were captured were held under the rules of the Geneva \nConvention and the people who were in that government were tried under \nthe rules of Nuremberg. There is no such government. These individuals \nfunction separately from any formal structure that could be called \ngovernance. And there is no right to the Geneva Convention because the \nGeneva Convention presumes certain statuses of combat and that there \nare certain engagements, even though it is in war, that have rules \nrelative to what can and should be done in a war that is appropriate.\n  None of these people are signatories to the Geneva Convention; they \nhave no rights under the Geneva Convention; and they disavow the \npurposes of the Geneva Convention. Their purpose is to kill for the \nreason that they believe their life will be improved and their \nafterlife, as they see it in their perverse view of Islam--which is a \ngreat religion but is being perverted by these fundamentalists. Their \npurpose is to kill Americans and destroy Western culture. To ascribe to \nthem certain rights, as if they were citizens of our Nation or citizens \nof some other nation that we were at war with, or as if they were \nparticipants in a group that was signatory to the Geneva Convention, is \nto undermine, first, the legitimacy of nations and what nations stand \nfor; and, secondly, the legitimacy of treaties and what treaties stand \nfor because you are essentially ascribing to these people rights and \nvalues which they reject and which they are fighting against.\n  Their purpose is to not support the Constitution or be governed by \nthe Constitution of America. Their purpose is to destroy America and \nthe Constitution. Their purpose is not to support the government of \nwhatever Islamic nation they come from. Their purpose is, in most \ninstances, to take that government over and to establish a religiously \nfundamentalist state which isn't governed at all by rules of Western or \ntraditional civil societies. And their purpose certainly isn't to \nsubscribe to the Geneva Convention.\n\n[[Page S7279]]\n\n  So when the Supreme Court made this decision, they found themselves \nfocusing on the trees but not on the forest. We have to ask ourselves \nwhy. Why would the Court make this decision? Well, maybe their purpose \nwas to force us, as a Congress, to clarify the role of the President, \nand if that is the case, then we should do it. We should act in a way \nthat gives the President the authority to hold these individuals \nbecause, what is the option? What is the option, to not hold them? That \nis not an option.\n  If you release these individuals, you basically assure yourself that \nyou are releasing people whose purpose it is to come back and do \ndramatic harm to our Nation and to Americans. What President--what \nPresident--who is sworn to uphold the Constitution and to protect this \ncountry, could possibly release these individuals in the context of \nwhat their purpose is? It would totally--totally--affront the \nresponsibility of the Presidency to do that.\n  The Court has made a decision which makes no sense from the \nstandpoint of reality, although it may make sense from the standpoint \nof theory. I believe the Congress needs to act, and act quickly, so \nthat this type of error can be corrected. It is, after all, a branch of \nGovernment that is not infallible--the Supreme Court. They have made \negregious mistakes in the past such as in the Dred Scott case. And so \nwe need to correct that and correct it promptly. We are an equal branch \nof Government. We have the capacity in this instance to correct it, it \nappears, at least from the dictum, if not from the actual core of the \nopinion. So we should do that. I would hope that the Congress would act \npromptly.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I make a point of order that a \nquorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business.

My understanding is that perhaps next week the Senate \nwill take up something called stem cell research, several pieces of \nlegislation dealing with stem cell research. I want to talk for a few \nmoments about that issue.\n  It has been just over 1 year now since the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives has passed a piece of legislation called the Stem Cell \nResearch Enhancement Act, with very broad bipartisan support.\n  Those of us in the Senate and those across this country who have lost \nloved ones, and most of us have, to some dread disease--Alzheimer's, \nParkinson's, heart disease, diabetes--the list is endless--cancer--\nunderstand that the urgency to do the research to find the cures for \nthese diseases really must be preeminent.\n  I am not suggesting that urgency should suggest to us there are no \nethical boundaries to research. There are ethical boundaries. But I \nalso want to make certain that this Senate moves in a way that is \nexpeditious and does the right thing.\n  I want to show a picture. This is a picture of a young girl I have \nmet a good number of times. She is in the middle. Her name is Camille. \nCamille is 13. She was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when she was 4 \nyears old. I have met with Camille's mother and Camille a good number \nof times. I have told her story once before on the Senate floor, but it \nis worth retelling because Camille and her parents and so many others \nacross this country are very concerned that we move forward on stem \ncell research and try to find ways to unlock the mysteries of this \ndisease called juvenile diabetes. But not just diabetes; ALS and \nParkinson's and Alzheimer's and so many more.\n  Type 1 diabetes, also called juvenile diabetes, occurs when a body's \nimmune system attacks and destroys certain cells in the pancreas called \nbeta cells. As a result, those beta cells that normally would produce \ninsulin are not producing insulin. So when the beta cells are destroyed \nand no insulin is produced, the glucose stays in the blood and can \ncause serious damage to the organs of the body. So Camille, like many \nwho have juvenile diabetes, will have to take insulin to stay alive. \nShe has to maintain a carefully calculated diet. She checks her blood \nglucose level several times a day and takes insulin injections, as many \nas six a day, just to say alive.\n  Her parents have told me about Camille and her schedule. They live by \nthe clock. They wake up in the middle of the night every night to check \non her, make sure her insulin levels are normal.\n  Every hour of every day in this country someone is diagnosed with \ntype 1 diabetes. With Camille, she has had some very close calls. She \nhas been in the hospital a great deal. Her diabetes has been pretty \ndevastating, and she has had a lot of close calls.\n  This young girl and her parents really want Congress to move forward \non stem cell research. There is so much promise in stem cell research. \nI want to describe why this is necessary. We are talking about human \nembryonic stem cell lines available for use in Federal research. In \nAugust of 2001 when the President said he will make lines available, he \nmade 78 lines available. Now there are only 22 of those lines available \nand all of these approved lines are contaminated in certain ways. That \nmeans that all of these stem cell lines will actually never be able to \nbe used for human clinical trials.\n  This August 9, 2001 deadline that the President had on research using \nthese 78 lines is simply an arbitrary deadline. Let me describe that \nthese cells, these stem cell lines come from discarded embryos, \nfertilized eggs that have been cryogenically frozen at an in vitro \nfertilization clinic. We had a person testify before the Senate \nCommerce Committee some years ago who believed that it was just wrong \nthat there should be eggs that are fertilized in a test tube or in a \nPetri dish and then implanted in the mother, something called in vitro \nfertilization. That is just wrong, he said. That should never ever have \nhappened. It should never have been done.\n\n  There are now 1 million people living among us who were born as a \nresult of in vitro fertilization, giving couples the ability to have \nchildren. Couples who previously have not been able to have children \nnow are able to have children through in vitro fertilization.\n  At these in vitro clinics, more eggs are fertilized than are actually \nimplanted and used. There are roughly 400,000 of embryos that are now \ncryogenically frozen at these clinics. Somewhere between 8,000 and \n10,000 each year are simply discarded. They become waste. They are \nthrown away.\n  Those who say that the use of those embryos is the equivalent of \nmurder, then, I believe, also probably say that the discarding of \nembryos that are not going to be used any longer, that have been \ncryogenically frozen--my guess is they believe those represent 8,000 or \n10,000 murders a year.\n  I don't believe that. Those embryos can never and will never become a \nhuman being unless implanted into a uterus. The question is: Can we use \nthese embryos to create stem cell lines to try to find cures to dread \ndiseases? Here is what has happened in stem cell research since the \nPresident announced the limitation.\n  Here is what President Bush said in 2004:\n\n       Embryonic stem cell research requires the destruction of \n     life. I'm the first President ever to allow Federal funding \n     for embryonic stem cell research. I did so because I, too, \n     hope that we'll discover cures from the stem cells. But we've \n     got to be very careful in balancing the ethics and the \n     science. And so I made the decision we wouldn't spend any \n     more money beyond the 70 lines, 22 of which are now in \n     action, because science is important, but so is ethics, so is \n     balancing life.\n\n  But these lines themselves were from in vitro fertilization clinics \nand would have been discarded and are being discarded routinely in this \ncountry, 8,000 to 11,000 a year. This is just an arbitrary decision.\n  So let me just make a couple of additional points. This is my former \ncolleague, Senator Jack Danforth, a former Republican colleague, as a \nmatter of fact, and ordained Episcopal priest. He wrote this in the New \nYork Times:\n\n\n[[Page S7280]]\n\n\n       It is not evident to many of us that cells in a Petri dish \n     are equivalent to identifiable people suffering from terrible \n     disease. I am and have always been pro-life. But the only \n     explanation for legislators comparing cells in a Petri dish \n     to babies in the womb is the extension of religious doctrine \n     into statutory law.\n\n  This from an Episcopal priest, a former Republican Senator.\n  Finally, this from Nancy Reagan:\n\n       Science has presented us with a hope called stem cell \n     research, which may provide our scientists with answers that \n     have so long been beyond our grasp. I just don't see how we \n     can turn our backs on this--there are just so many diseases \n     that can be cured or at least helped. We have lost so much \n     time already, and I just really can't bear to lose any more.\n\n  I believe that we ought to proceed with thoughtful, ethical \nguidelines on stem cell research. I understand that is a controversial \nposition for some. In fact, in the last campaign for office for me, my \nopponent ran a television advertisement that was novel and fairly \ndisgusting. In it was a fellow who was sitting around a campfire with \nsome little children. One of the little children said to the camp fire \nleader: Tell us a scary story.\n  And the camp fire leader said: Well, there is this man named Dorgan \nand he has a plan to put embryos inside the womb of a mother and grow \nthem for body parts to be harvested later.\n  An unbelievable television commercial, bearing no relationship to \nwhat has been discussed under any set of circumstances. But the \ncontroversy that exists these days with stem cell research, I \nunderstand; I am respectful to those who disagree with me on this \nsubject.\n  I am mindful that there should be solid ethical guidelines in terms \nof how it is dealt with. But I don't believe this is about harvesting \nbody parts. This is about giving life. This is about giving hope. This \nis about unlocking the mysteries of dread diseases--to tell those who \nlive with Alzheimer's or heart disease or cancer or juvenile diabetes \nor ALS or Parkinson's that we are doing everything we can to find ways \nto cure these diseases. That is what this research is about. I really \nbelieve it is about giving life--providing opportunity for those who \nare suffering from these dread diseases.\n  That is why I am a cosponsor of the Senate companion bill to the \nHouse bill called the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, which has 41 \ncosponsors. It is a bipartisan group of Senators who has cosponsored \nthis legislation.\n  I take some hope with the statement of the majority leader that it \nappears we will begin debating this issue within the next week or two.\n  It is important to be clear that this bill only deals with stem \ncells--embryos that were created for fertility purposes by in vitro \nfertilization clinics that would otherwise be thrown away. That is all \nthat is being discussed. As I indicated, there are about 400,000 of \nthose embryos that are now frozen at in vitro fertilization clinics.\n  I know there will be great controversy when we discuss this. However, \nI am comforted, as well, that there is a bipartisan group of Senators \nwho believes this ought to be done and supports the legislation. It is \na fact that sometimes those of us who serve here lament that we are \ntaking lightly things that should be taken seriously, or taking \nseriously things that are light. This is a serious issue. And bringing \nthis to the floor of the Senate means that we are sinking our teeth \ninto a piece of public policy that is very important and that we \nrecognize is controversial but nonetheless very important for us to \nmake decisions about.\n  I look forward to being a part of that discussion and that debate \nwhen it comes to the floor of the Senate, hopefully, next week if the \ninformation I have is correct, if not within a week or so following.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

Mr. President, we have an interesting \nsituation where the Department of Defense is requesting that seven \nBlack Hawk helicopters that the U.S. Army owns but are detailed to the \nDrug Enforcement Administration in the Bahamas be taken out of the \nBahamas. No doubt there is a need elsewhere in the world, perhaps in \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. But this Senator wants to make the case, as I \ndid 2 weeks ago when we had the Defense authorization bill on the \nfloor, that the United States Government needs to find some additional \nhelicopters to replace those that are there for the purpose of \ninterdiction of all kinds of contraband.\n  Indeed, we have experienced enormous success from having those seven \nhelicopters in the last 5 years: 800 drug smugglers have been \napprehended as a result of those helicopters being there; 25 tons of \ncocaine have been taken away from the drug smugglers; 82 tons of \nmarijuana, as a result of the effectiveness of these helicopters. Of \ncourse, I am just speaking about the interdiction of contraband drugs, \nnot even to speak of the interdiction of all of the human smuggling \nthat is attempted into the United States through that route.\n  It might be instructive for us to know that when a similar situation \nwas done elsewhere in the Caribbean, in Central America in the late \n1990s, and seven helicopters were taken from Central America with a \nsimilar kind of mission, the incidence of drug smuggling rose \nprecipitously. Of course, that is what will happen if these helicopters \nare not replaced.\n  Since the 1980s, these helicopters have made an enormous difference. \nFor example, it is hard to believe the statistic I am going to tell \nyou, but 80 percent of all the cocaine that was smuggled into this \ncountry came through that region of the Atlantic, the Bahamas and the \nTurks and the Caicos, back in the 1980s. That percentage of the total \ncocaine smuggled into the country has been reduced to 10 percent. So \nthe proof is in the pudding. The success is there.\n  Two weeks ago when we had the Defense authorization bill on the \nfloor, I added an amendment that said that the U.S. Government should \ncome up with a replacement for those helicopters. If they are needed \nelsewhere, fine; that is, the war on terror. We also have a war on \nterror and a war to defend the homeland as well. That is right here. \nThat is the southern sector off the shores of the Southern United \nStates.\n  It is my hope that the Defense Department will take very seriously \nthe Defense authorization bill that makes that statement to the U.S. \nGovernment. Surely in the inventory of the entire U.S. Government, \nthere are seven helicopters that can replace the ones being taken out \nand sent to Iraq. The success of our interdiction and the protection of \nour homeland is at stake.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/10/senate-section/article/S7280-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7280-S7281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                   sergeant first class terry wallace\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss \nof U.S. Army SFC Terry Wallace of Nebraska. Sergeant Wallace died when \nan improvised explosive device detonated near his military vehicle in \nTaji, Iraq on June 27. He was 33 years old.\n  Sergeant Wallace was born in Winnsboro, LA. He graduated from \nWinnsboro High School, where he ran track and played drums in the \nschool band. He enlisted in the Army in 1990. In recent years, Sergeant \nWallace lived in Bellevue, NE, with his wife Shunda and daughter Raven.\n  Sergeant Wallace had several assignments overseas, including other \nlocations in the Middle East. In December 2005, he was deployed to Iraq \nwith the 4th Battalion, 42nd Field Artillery Regiment, 4th Infantry \nDivision, based out of Fort Hood, TX. Sergeant Wallace will be \nremembered as a smart, hardworking man who was honored to serve and \ndefend his country.

Mr. President, the Foreign Relations Committee recently \nhad an opportunity to mark up historic legislation that would permit \ncivilian nuclear cooperation between the United States and India. I say \nhistoric because such cooperation will dramatically shift 30 years of \nnonproliferation policy towards India and potentially set the United \nStates-India relationship on a new foundation.\n  Our relationship with India is one of our most important. As we look \nahead to the coming decades, it is clear that United States-India \nrelations will be crucial to establishing a secure, sustainable, and \nprosperous global system. But as we consider a fundamental shift in the \ninternational nonproliferation regime, we must also make sure we have \nadequate protections in place to guard against the spread of nuclear \nweapons and weapons technology.\n  I appreciate the fact that the legislation we were asked to mark up \nrepresented a substantial amount of work from Chairman Lugar, Ranking \nMember Biden, and their staffs. This bill was a substantial improvement \nover the original proposal, which would have removed any meaningful \ncongressional oversight from consideration of a nuclear cooperation \nagreement with India and which had virtually no protections for \nnonproliferation concerns.\n  However, I remain concerned with the broader implications of this \nlegislation. My primary concern is this: the threat of nuclear weapons \nto the United States and the spread of nuclear weapons and nuclear \nmaterial are among the gravest dangers that our country faces. It is \ncrucial to our national security that the nuclear nonproliferation \nframework remains strong. I want to make sure that the United States, \nas a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, is working to \nstrengthen the international treaties and regimes that have been \ndesigned to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.\n  That is why I offered an amendment that would simply spell out in \ngreater detail that this deal will be only civilian in nature and that \nnone of the assistance the United States provides to India will be used \nfor strengthening or further developing India's nuclear weapons \narsenal. This is something we are already committed to under article 1 \nof the NPT. The amendment would have required the President to certify \nthat he had received sufficient assurances that U.S. assistance would \nnot contribute directly or indirectly to the development of India's \nnuclear weapons arsenal.\n  This should not have been a controversial requirement, but \nunfortunately my amendment was defeated during markup. However, I was \npleased to have four of my Democratic colleagues vote in favor of my \namendment. They recognized that this is an important, legitimate \nconcern and that a Presidential determination along these lines would \nhave provided protections against the diversion of U.S. technology, \nequipment, and fuel toward a nuclear weapons program. In the absence of \nsuch protections, I was compelled to vote against this legislation.\n  My ``no'' vote does not mean that I am opposed to the entire deal. I \nwill work with my colleagues to ensure that the final version of this \nbill contains adequate protections against the spread of nuclear \nweapons technology.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/10/senate-section/article/S7281-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          FISHERIES RESTORATION AND IRRIGATION MITIGATION ACT\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleagues from Oregon \nand Washington in introducing S. 3522, the Fisheries Restoration and \nIrrigation Mitigation Act, FRIMA, of 2006. It is important that we pool \nour resources and work together in the region to get serious about fish \nrestoration. FRIMA has proven to be cost effective and efficient at \nthis goal and, therefore, should be reauthorized.\n  The FRIMA program exemplifies the great potential of forward-thinking \npublic-private partnerships, and the wisdom of working closely with \nlocal communities. Since it was enacted in 2000, we have achieved real \nresults. In my home State of Idaho, according to the Fish and Wildlife \nService, 13 projects have been completed and 206 miles of streams have \nbeen ``protected, enhanced, or made accessible to fish.'' One example \nof work being done is in the Salmon River Basin near Salmon, ID, where \npartners such as the Lemhi Soil and Water Conservation District and the \nU.S. Forest Service have installed fish screens on three irrigation \nwater diversions. These screens protect salmon and other fish species \nand allow farmers to continue to irrigate their farms. And let me \nemphasize in supporting the reauthorization of this program that there \nremain important projects such as these yet to be completed.\n  This program makes sense, especially from a financial perspective. \nFRIMA extends the reach of Federal dollars by enlisting other \ninterested parties. This results in more money for FRIMA projects and \nmore talent and experience working to achieve success. In fact, from \nfiscal years 2002 to 2004, local and State government, businesses, \nirrigation districts, and environmental groups, to name just a few, \nhave shouldered 58 percent of the cost. This cost-sharing surpassed the \n35 percent threshold required in the original legislation.\n  An important aspect of this legislation reduces the hurdles for \npublic and private restoration dollars to participate in the Fish and \nWildlife Service's cost-sharing program to protect, enhance, and \nrestore important fish habitat in the Pacific Northwest. This \nclarification is important so that the Bonneville Power \nAdministration's nonfederal dollars can be used to make other Federal \nand private money go further to recover salmon.\n  Finally, this program has received the support of our new Secretary \nof the Interior, Dirk Kempthorne. When he was Governor of Idaho he \nremarked:\n\n       The FRIMA program serves as an excellent example of \n     government and private land owners working together to \n     promote conservation. The screening of irrigation diversions \n     plays a key role in Idaho's efforts to restore salmon \n     populations while protecting rural economies.\n\n  The Idaho Fish and Game Department and the Idaho Water Users \nAssociation are also strong advocates of the program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/10/senate-section/article/S7281-3", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          RECOGNIZING TOM COTA\n\n Mr. THUNE.

DICK CHAMPION\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Mr. Dick \nChampion, director of the Independence Water Pollution Control \nDepartment.\n  Mr. Champion is an exceptional leader and public steward dedicated to \nthe improvement of Missouri's and the Nation's environment and public \nhealth. It is my pleasure to congratulate Mr. Champion on becoming the \nnew president of the National Association of Clean Water Agencies, \nNACWA, formerly the Association of Metropolitan Sewerage Agencies, \nAMSA, Mr. Champion is ideally suited for this national leadership \nposition.\n  Mr. Champion began his career in water pollution control in 1969. He \nhas been with the City of Independence, MO, Water Pollution Control \nDepartment for the past 27 years and has been director of the \ndepartment since 1983. The department is responsible for the Sanitary \nSewer Utility, the Storm Water Management Program, the Household \nHazardous Waste Management Program, and related environmental \ncompliance.\n  He was appointed by the Jackson County Executive and legislature to \nthe Jackson County Stormwater Commission, to coordinate regional \nstormwater policy and planning. Since its creation in 2001, Mr. \nChampion has been serving as vice-chair of the commission.\n  He has been an active member of NACWA since 1992, was elected to the \nboard of directors in 1999, and now serves at NACWA's vice president \nand chair of the Strategic Planning Committee. Mr. Champion will become \nNACWA's president on July 18--an impressive accomplishment and one that \nwill no doubt help secure NACWA's role as the leading advocate for \nsound water quality policies.\n  Mr. Champion earned a BS degree in political science with an emphasis \nin local government and public administration from Central Missouri \nState University in 1973. As a student and throughout his career Mr. \nChampion has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to public service \nand the improvement of water quality in Missouri. The fish and \nfishermen of Missouri owe a great deal to his tireless work to \nguarantee clean water.\n  With Mr. Champion as president, NACWA will no doubt build on its \nreputation as the leading advocate for responsible national policies \nthat advance clean water and a healthy environment. Simply stated, when \nI hear the term ``environmentalist,'' I think of public servants like \nMr. Champion first.\n  Again, it is my sincere pleasure to congratulate Mr. Champion on \nbecoming president of NACWA. I look forward to working with him and \nNACWA to ensure continued water quality progress for Missouri and the \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/10/senate-section/article/S7282-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JOE PURCELL\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, on Saturday, June 24, one of the \nfinest public servants that my State has produced was honored in his \nhometown of Benton, AR. Joe Edward Purcell was many things to many \npeople. He was a devoted family man. He was a loyal friend. He was also \na dedicated public servant whose reputation for integrity and \nprofessionalism brought honor and respectability to every public office \nhe held.\n  Joe Purcell was born in the small southeast Arkansas town of Helena. \nShortly after graduating from Little Rock Junior College, he enlisted \nin the U.S. Army for service in World War II. Upon his return from \nservice, he entered law school at the University of Arkansas in \nFayetteville and graduated in 1952. Later that year, he opened his law \npractice in Benton and quickly earned the reputation throughout the \ncommunity of a trustworthy advocate of the people he represented.\n  ``Honest Joe'' carried that reputation with him through what would \nbecome a distinguished career of public service at both city and State \nlevels of government. Beginning in 1955, Joe served as Benton City \nAttorney and later as Benton Municipal Judge. In 1967, he was elected \nas attorney general for the State of Arkansas. During his tenure, his \nleadership led to a number of reforms and innovations, including the \nestablishment of the consumer protection office which to this day \nprovides consumer education and promotes the principles of fair \nbusiness practices and honest balloting.\n  After an unsuccessful gubernatorial campaign, Joe was elected three \ntimes as Lieutenant Governor beginning in 1975. In that capacity, he \nalso became the acting Governor of our State for 6 days in early 1979, \nwhen he filled the unexpired term of former Governor and Senator-elect, \nDavid Pryor, in the days prior to the gubernatorial inauguration of \nBill Clinton. It was Clinton who would later describe his predecessor \nas ``a self-made man who represented honesty and integrity in public \nservice.'' Joe would serve as our State's Lieutenant Governor until his \nretirement from public service in 1981.\n  The Benton sidewalk memorial that was recently unveiled in honor of \nJoe Purcell is fittingly located just in front of the old Federal \nbuilding downtown. I am hopeful that it will serve as a reminder to \ngenerations of Arkansans not just of the numerous accomplishments that \nJoe Purcell compiled over his political career but also of the legacy \nof integrity and public service that he has left us all. The genuine \ncompassion he held for those around him led him to a life dedicated to \nmaking his community and his State better places to live for all of us. \nIt is truly a selfless principle for those of us in public service, and \nthose of us in our personal lives, to embody each and every day.\n  I am proud to have on my staff a young man named David Hogue. David \nis the grandson of Joe Purcell and it was at his suggestion that this \ntribute in Benton came to fruition. David has been a tremendous asset \nto my office, and I am appreciative of all of his hard work and \ndedication on behalf of our State and its citizens. This fall, he will \nbe headed to law school in Fayetteville, just like his grandfather so \nmany years before, and I wish him the very best.\n  It is often said that a community reveals itself, not only by the men \nit produces, but also by the men it honors and remembers. Joe Purcell \nembodied the best in all of us and because of people like him, the \ncommunity of Benton and the State of Arkansas are such wonderful places \nto live today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/10/senate-section/article/S7282-3", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7282-S7283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING THE PRINCETON HEALTH CARE CENTER\n\n MR. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the \nlongevity and accomplishments of the Princeton Health Care Center in \nPrinceton, West Virginia. Last week, this long-term care provider \ncelebrated its 25th anniversary, and I wish to recognize its \nachievements and its enormous contribution to its community. Twenty-\nfive years ago, I stood with many community leaders in Princeton, at \nthat time as Governor of West Virginia, to dedicate a brand new \nfacility called the Princeton Health Care Center.\n  Now, two and a half decades later, the Princeton Health Care Center \nis a 120-bed facility in the heart of Mercer County. It serves \nresidents of Princeton and surrounding communities, including Bluefield \nand most of southern West Virginia. The facility offers medical \nservices, nursing services, social services, therapeutic and \nrecreational activities, dietary services, financial planning and \nconsulting, transportation, and other standard activities many of us \nuse in our daily lives. This litany of available services shows that \nthis facility attends to all the needs of its residents--physical \nhealth, mental health, social well-being, and others. The health care \ncenter is located very near to the Princeton community, providing \nresidents with easy access if it is ever needed.\n  Long-term care is an enormously important part of our health care \nsystem and one that is often overlooked or underfunded. By the year \n2020, there will be more than 70 million older persons in America--more \nthan twice the number today. We must provide our seniors with the \ndignity and peace of mind they deserve in their golden years. \nFacilities like the Princeton Health Care Center provide a place for \nthose who need care to live comfortably and in their community while \nstill getting the assistance that they require.\n  The facility in Princeton is located in a serene setting, granting \nresidents access to nature in all seasons and allowing them to enjoy \nthe outdoors. In addition to the center's environs and its many \namenities, the center boasts a\n\n[[Page S7283]]\n\nwell-trained and professional staff, which attends to the needs of its \nresidents.\n  The board of directors and all those involved with the center have \nmade it a wonderful success for the past 25 years. The center's \nassociation with the Princeton Community Hospital has served its \nresidents well, and I look forward to decades more of success for this \nfacility.\n  Mr. President, I hope the Senate will join me in congratulating the \nstaff and management of the Princeton Health Care Center for 25 \nsuccessful years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/10/senate-section/article/S7283-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO SHIGEJI IKENAGA\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I also wish to honor a \nleader in the automotive industry and a friend of West Virginia, \nShigeji Ikenaga, as well as the team members of Diamond Electric \nlocated in Eleanor, WV. Together they have contributed to the company's \nglobal growth and economic prosperity, as well as developing West \nVirginia's automotive industry.\n  President Shigeji Ikenaga has worked for Diamond Electric since 1954, \ndedicating an impressive 52 years of service to the automotive \nindustry. During his extensive career, Mr. Ikenaga was instrumental in \nbringing Diamond Electric to the United States and tapping our \nworkforce to help produce automotive parts. In 1987, Diamond Electric \nestablished a plant in the Detroit, MI area. Then, in 1992, Diamond \nElectric started manufacturing ignition coils at its headquarters in \nDundee, MI. Soon thereafter, West Virginia began to benefit from \noperational expansions by Diamond Electric. In April, 1996, just as \nToyota was beginning its work in West Virginia, ground was broken for \nan ignition coil plant in Eleanor, WV.\n  Building upon Diamond Electric's success in North America, Mr. \nIkenaga expanded to other continents, establishing a manufacturing \nplant in Esztergom, Hungary, and incorporating the company in Suzhou, \nChina. These expansions solidified Diamond Electric's stance in the \nglobal market.\n  As is evidenced by the various awards of excellence he and the \ncompany have received, Mr. Ikenaga's work and the work of his employees \nis exceptional. In 1994, Diamond Electric received the Deming Award, \nwhich recognizes medium and small companies for their outstanding total \nquality control program. In addition, Mr. Ikenaga was awarded the Medal \nwith Blue Ribbon in 1997 and again honored in 2002 when he was awarded \nthe Order of the Sacred Treasure, Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon. These \nawards are testament to the high quality and hard work of Diamond \nElectric and its employees.\n  The Diamond Electric employees of West Virginia have also made an \nenormous contribution to the company's success. The plant has been \nawarded the Toyota Delivery and Quality Awards each year since \nbeginning production in 1998. This allowed Diamond Electric one of \ntheir greatest achievements to date--becoming the first U.S. supplier \nto build an ignition coil for the Lexus SUV engine.\n  Moreover, because of the well-earned success in West Virginia, the \nfacility has expanded 3 times since production started in 1997, growing \nfrom a 50,000-square-foot facility and 3.4 million in capacity to a \n110,000-square-foot facility and 13 million in capacity. Currently, the \ncompany employs nearly 150 West Virginians.\n  As the company has proven numerous times throughout the years, they \nare a leader in the automotive industry thanks to the extraordinary \nefforts of Mr. Ikenaga and the workforce at the Eleanor, WV facility. \nDiamond Electric and its employees are pioneers, expanding to other \ncontinents and manufacturing new and innovative automotive products.\n  Additionally, Mr. Ikenaga's actions have not only illustrated his \ndesire for professional growth but also a desire to educate young \nindividuals through Diamond Electric's participation in The Dictionary \nProject. I was very proud to learn that Diamond Electric presented \nevery third grader in Putnam County this past year a dictionary to help \nthem with their studies.\n  I take this opportunity to thank Mr. Ikenaga for his confidence in \nWest Virginia and our remarkable workforce. I also congratulate Diamond \nElectric's remarkable team members for playing such an important role \nin Putnam County's growing economy. I appreciate your hard work and \ncommitment to the automotive industry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/10/senate-section/article/S7283-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING DUSTIN ADAMS\n\n Mr. THUNE.

Over the years, the Natchitoches \nNational Fish Hatchery has been involved with raising 16 species of \nfish and has stocked more than\n\n[[Page S7284]]\n\n164 million fish. The station has been an invaluable resource to \nLouisiana's wildlife and fisheries.\n  Federal fish hatcheries have been an important part of our Nation's \nresource management efforts for more than a century.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the amendments to the Constitution \nand Convention of the International Telecommunication Union (Geneva, \n1992), as amended by the Plenipotentiary Conference (Kyoto, 1994) and \nthe Plenipotentiary Conference (Minneapolis, 1998), together with the \ndeclarations and reservations by the United States, all as contained in \nthe Final Acts of the Plenipotentiary Conference (Marrakesh, 2002).\n  I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the \nDepartment of State concerning these amendments.\n  The Plenipotentiary Conference (Marrakesh, 2002) adopted amendments \nthat would expand the field of individuals eligible for election to the \nRadio Regulations Board; provide for functional privileges and \nimmunities for members of the Radio Regulations Board; strengthen the \nfinances of the International Telecommunication Union by, among others, \nproviding for sector member contributions to defray the expenses of \nregional conferences in which they participate and clarifying that \noperational plans prepared by the International Telecommunication Union \nSecretary-General and Directors of each of the International \nTelecommunication Union sectors must reflect the financial implications \nof the activities proposed; provide for sector members to be \nrepresented as observers at meetings of the Council; and recognize the \nauthority of the Radiocommunication Assembly, the World \nTelecommunication Standardization Assembly, and the World \nTelecommunication Development Conference to adopt working methods and \nprocedures for their respective sectors.\n  Consistent with longstanding practices, the United States, in signing \nthe 2002 amendments, made certain declarations and reservations. \nSubject to those declarations and reservations, I believe the United \nStates should ratify the 2002 amendments to the International \nTelecommunication Union Constitution and Convention. Those amendments \nwill contribute to the International Telecommunication Union's ability \nto adapt to changes in the telecommunication environment and, in so \ndoing, serve the needs of the United States Government and United \nStates industry. It is my hope that the Senate will take early action \non this matter and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n                                                      George W.
