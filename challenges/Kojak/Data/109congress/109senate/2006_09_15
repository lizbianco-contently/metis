Mr. President, I want to make a few observations about \nthe war on terror, which certainly is an issue that has been front and \ncenter in the Senate and over in the House during the last few weeks.\n  There are really two issues. The first is, what are the tools the \nPresident needs to continue to effectively defend America?\n  We know that since 9/11 there have been no successful attacks on our \ncountry. We know before 9/11 they were at war with us. They tried to \nblow up the World Trade Center. They blew up our Embassies in East \nAfrica. They blew up the USS Cole and killed 17 sailors. They were at \nwar with us, but we were not yet at war with them.\n  Since we have been at war with them, we have not had a successful \nattack at home. Obviously, we are doing something very skillfully and \nvery correctly. A part of that is the effective interrogation of \nterrorists and the effective surveillance of terrorists. Both effective \ninterrogation and effective surveillance of terrorists prevent terror \nattacks and save lives. That has happened over the last 5 years.\n  Why does the President need these specific tools? Why does he need \nthe bill he proposed? Intelligence leaders have said, as recently as \nyesterday, that we will have to shut down a demonstrably effective \nprogram without these tools. We will lose the intelligence and the \nsecurity the intelligence provides.\n  So what is next for us in debating these important issues to help \nprotect Americans at home? Only one side of the argument has been \nprevalent in the last day or so. We will have an opportunity to fully \ndefine the two issues to which I referred. A floor debate will \nhighlight important bright-line issues.\n  For example, do we provide sensitive classified information to \nterrorists? There has actually been the suggestion that somehow a \nfundamental sense of fairness would require that we hand classified \ninformation over to terrorist defendants. That will be one of the big \nissues confronting us in the Senate.\n  Do we shut down an intelligence program that we know--it's not in \ndispute--that we know has saved lives and protected Americans? Do we \nwant our troops exposed to the vagaries and whims of international \ncourts?\n  What about this idea that we should not define Common article 3 in \nthe United States? Well, Common article 3 is going to be defined. We \nknow that. The only issue is, who will define it? European courts are \nnow defining it. Maybe the U.S. Congress and the U.S. courts ought to \nbe the final word on defining Common article 3. So, as I said, the \nquestion is really not whether Common article 3 is going to be \ndefined--it is going to be--but, rather, who will be defining that \narticle.\n  Common article 3 was written back in 1949, almost 60 years ago. Some \nof its terms--like prohibiting ``outrages upon personal dignity''--are \ninherently vague. As a result, foreign courts have been filling the \nvoid and doing that interpretation.\n  To give you an example, the European Court of Human Rights has \ndeclared as follows: merely having to wait on death row is ``inhuman or \ndegrading treatment of punishment.''\n\n[[Page S9650]]\n\nThat is a European court defining waiting on death row as being \nunacceptable. A European court has further said being in a cell with \nlimited natural light is ``degrading,'' and that having little \nactivities to occupy a prisoner is ``degrading.''\n  Now, the U.S. Congress should not sit on its hands and let some \nforeign judge--some foreign judge--define the meaning of Common article \n3 in a way that most Americans would object to and which would put our \ntroops at risk. That is why I support the President's position on using \nthe Detainee Treatment Act--Senator McCain's act that we just adopted \nlast year by a vote of 90 to 9 in the Senate--as the standard, use the \nMcCain Detainee Treatment Act as the standard for defining Common \narticle 3.\n  The DTA prohibits ``cruel, inhuman, or degrading'' treatment as \ndefined by established standards of U.S. law. That is Senator McCain's \nbill, which we adopted last year, defining what is appropriate \ntreatment of detainees.\n  So these will be the issues we will have to argue and discuss in the \nfull Senate with all 100 Members participating. We have not heard from \na whole lot of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle yet, and I \nknow they are going to want to participate in this debate and share \ntheir views about whether these standards should be determined by the \nU.S. Congress or by European courts.\n  What we do know for sure, without question--no ambiguity--is that the \ncurrent program works and has saved us from terrorist attacks and \nprevented us from being attacked again at home for over 5 years. The \nPresident needs tools to conduct these programs effectively to protect \nAmericans at home. His proposal for terrorist detainees is one of those \nimportant tools. We do not all agree at this point about how to go \nabout this, and that is why the Senate is a great deliberative body, \nand we will have that discussion on the Senate floor. But at some point \nwe will come together and, hopefully, do it in a way where the \ninterrogation of detainees can continue.\n  We know the Director of the CIA said yesterday that under the armed \nservices bill, that program will have to be shut down. We know it has \nworked. We know it has saved lives. We need to solve this problem for \nthe American people so they can continue to be protected at home, able \nto go about their daily lives in a manner they have become accustomed \nto over the years in this great, free society.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/15/senate-section/article/S9650-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I think my friend, the distinguished \nmajority whip, is talking about things that really do not exist. We \nhave now in the Senate a bipartisan agreement on how to approach the \nHamdan decision, the detainee problem. We had all Democrats and four \nRepublicans--far more than a majority in the committee--who voted \nyesterday to bring the matter to the floor that would solve this \nproblem.\n  It is not a problem at this point that has been solved by the \nEuropean courts. It has been solved by the U.S. Senate. We certainly \nknow that the document that has come from the Armed Services Committee \nis imperfect, and we can always try to work to improve that. I think we \nshould move forward on this issue. I think there is certainly nothing \nin the mind of the American people or the American public that what the \nPresident has suggested is final.\n  Certainly, he is not infallible, as indicated by Colin Powell--four-\nstar general, general in the Army, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, Secretary of State for a number of years. He says the \nPresident's approach is wrong. He is not talking about the European \ncourts determining what we should do. He is saying that the approach of \nSenator McCain and others is the proper way to go.\n  I would also say--without a long discussion--we have the same \nsituation at this stage in the Senate dealing with domestic spying. We \nhave a bipartisan solution to this issue. Members of the Judiciary \nCommittee, on a bipartisan basis, voted to bring a bill to the Senate. \nAgain, I am sure that bill is not perfect, but it certainly is a \nbipartisan solution to a problem that exists, one that is in compliance \nwith the Constitution of the United States.\n  Mr. President, the Iraq war has been a diversion on the war on \nterror, and that seems pretty clear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/15/senate-section/article/S9650-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9650-S9651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             TAX EXTENDERS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, changing subjects just for a minute, prior \nto the August recess, Republicans attempted to win support for their \nattempt to repeal the estate tax by attaching that to a flawed minimum \nwage increase that was only meant for show and not to actually \naccomplish anything. And they also tied to it popular tax provisions, \nreferred to as extenders.\n  Now, keep in mind the extenders were all agreed to by Democrats and \nRepublicans. They had agreed to this, and the only thing that was not \nthere was the signature, and that was to take place at 8 o'clock at \nnight in the Capitol. When people came back to sign the conference \nreport, word had come from the White House: Do away with this \nagreement. So that is why they came up with the so-called Trifecta: \nestate tax repeal, extenders, minimum wage.\n  Republicans were very clear regarding their strategy. Representative \nZach Wamp of Tennessee claimed that Democrats had been ``outfoxed.'' \nWell, of course, this bill did not pass because it was flawed. It was \nso unfair to the American people that you would do away with all these \nimportant tax provisions for the middle class in an effort to get a \nrepeal of the estate tax that would affect the richest of the rich: \n8,100 Americans.\n  The strategy of holding the extenders hostage to their estate tax \ngiveaway put these important provisions in jeopardy of not getting \nenacted ever. As if to emphasize this point, Senator Judd Gregg said--\nand I quote--``[i]f you don't kill the hostage, there's no threat.'' \nHow about that.\n  Now, Senator Baucus yesterday--on more than one occasion--requested \nunanimous consent to delink the extenders, which have broad bipartisan \nsupport, from the Republicans' ill-fated attempt to repeal the estate \ntax for a small number of the wealthiest families in America.\n  American families and businesses are paying the price for this \nRepublican do-nothing Congress's failure to extend these tax breaks. \nMillions of families and individuals are facing higher taxes today as a \nresult of this failure.\n  Mr. President, this is just not Harry Reid, a Democrat, speaking. \nLook what was said yesterday by the chairman of the Finance Committee, \na Republican, Charles Grassley of Iowa:\n\n       A delay of legislative beyond the anticipated recess date \n     of September 29, 2006, will cause hardship, tax compliance \n     problems and confusion for the millions of taxpayers who \n     claim these widely applicable tax benefits.\n\n  According to a memo from Senator Grassley's office, after consulting \nwith IRS officials, the IRS contracts with several printers to produce \n1040 and 1040A income tax return forms are in jeopardy. It also said \nthat IRS must finalize the information it is to submit to these \nprinters by October 15 in order to ensure forms will be printed in time \nand be distributed to taxpayers at the beginning of 2007; that if \nCongress has not passed extenders legislation by that time, the forms \nwill omit lines instructing taxpayers to compute State and local sales \ntax, college tuition, or out-of-pocket classroom expenses into their \ntax liability.\n  American families and businesses are paying the price because of this \ndo-nothing Congress. They refuse to extend important tax breaks. \nFamilies who recently took their sons and daughters to college now \nwonder whether the tuition deduction Republicans allowed to expire last \nyear will get reinstated.\n  What are these tax extenders? The State and local sales tax \ndeduction. In States all over the country which have an income tax, \nthey are allowed to deduct that from their Federal income tax. Now that \nthe Republicans failed to act in States where individuals pay sales \ntax, they are not able to do this.\n  The tuition deduction is another one which allows parents and \nstudents to deduct all tuition and related expenses\n\n[[Page S9651]]\n\nfrom their taxable income. It benefits 3.6 million taxpayers nationwide \nand 26,000 in Nevada.\n  The teacher classroom expenses provision gives teachers above-the-\nline deduction of as much as $250. Mr. President, 8,100 people are \nseeking to benefit from the repeal of the estate tax, which is millions \nand millions of dollars. So why should we be concerned about some \nschoolteacher for $250? Because $250 is what teachers pay out of their \nown pockets to get supplies for the classroom that school districts \ndon't pay for. They can deduct as much as $250 for personal funds spent \nby them to buy classroom supplies. This benefits 3.3 million teachers \nnationwide and about 22,000 teachers in Nevada.\n  There are many other items that are important in these extenders.\n  America needs a new direction, one that puts the interests of the \nhard-working families ahead of special interests. How can we be working \non the Oman Free Trade Agreement and let this go? I don't understand \nthis. The priorities are upside down. We need a new direction, and we \nare not getting any direction from the administration or certainly from \nthe Republican-dominated Congress.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/15/senate-section/article/S9651-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9651-S9652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n                          DO-NOTHING CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend from \nNevada, Senator Reid, for that statement because here on the closing \nday of this week's session, as we wrap up the second week of 4 weeks, \nit really is a time to reflect on what little time is left in this \nsession, and when Senator Reid refers repeatedly to a do-nothing \nCongress, it is understandable. Two weeks down and 2 weeks to go before \nthe election and no budget.\n  This so-called fiscally conservative leadership in the Senate cannot \nproduce a budget on how we are going to spend our money this year. They \ncannot produce a budget and, if I am not mistaken, I say to the \nDemocratic leader, I don't believe a single appropriations bill has \nbeen signed into law at this point.\n  Mr. REID. That is right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Here we are days away from the end of this fiscal year, \nand we have recorded in the last 6 years, under the Bush administration \nand the Republican-led Congress, the worst deficits in the history of \nthe United States. We have an administration which inherited a surplus \nfrom the Clinton administration--several years of surplus and paying \ndown the debt of America and strengthening Social Security--and they \nsquandered it, wasted it. They turned their backs on it and allowed us \nto sink deeper and deeper into debt--a debt we ultimately will have to \npay, a debt which, sadly, is being financed by foreign countries such \nas Japan, China, Korea, and the OPEC nations. They are the mortgage \nholders of America's mortgage.\n  Who will pay off this mortgage? The young people of America, our \nchildren and grandchildren--as this Congress heaps debt upon debt, as \nthis President has the dubious distinction of being the first President \nin the history of the United States of America to call for a tax cut \nduring a war. The reason no other President has done it is because it \ndoesn't make sense. You have the ordinary expenses of Government that \nare increased because of the war you must fight, and this President \nthen says: Let's cut taxes while we are at it, digging a deeper hole \nfor America's economy and America's future.\n  So there is no budget, not one appropriations bill signed by the \nPresident, no increase in the minimum wage--9 years now. For 9 years, \nthis Republican President and Congress have refused to increase the \nbasic wage for some of the hardest working people in America. It is \n$5.15 an hour. That is what it has been. It has been 9 years since we \nhave increased it.\n  Think about each of our own personal experiences, how the expenses of \nlife have gone up in that period of time, and then put yourself in the \nshoes of a single mother I met in Rockford, who went through a brutal \ndivorce. She luckily has custody of the children away from a father who \nmistreated them badly. She has them in her tiny house, and she has a \nminimum wage job. She has three kids, this mom, and she makes minimum \nwage. How does she make it? She goes to the local church, where they \nhave a food pantry. She tries to get help from charities in the area. \nShe looks for used clothing. She is trying to keep her family together. \nWhat kind of helping hand has this Congress given to her? None. For 9 \nyears, we have said to her: Sorry, next year's salary will be the same \nas last year's.\n\n  I hope the cost of utilities doesn't go up or the cost of food or the \ncost of rent. Yet we know they continue to go up. So for 9 years, this \nCongress has failed to increase the minimum wage, and they are about to \nwrap up another session with that dubious distinction.\n  There is a footnote to this story worth noting. In that same 9-year \nperiod of time, Congress has voted itself a $31,000 annual increase in \nsalary. The Democratic caucus of the Senate has said that is the end of \nthat story. There will be no increases in congressional pay until the \nminimum wage is increased. No excuses. Maybe that will focus the \nattention of our colleagues on a lot of people who are not as fortunate \nas those of us who serve here.\n  We have had no change in the ethics rules despite the scandals of the \nlatest Congress, despite the resignation of the Republican leader in \nthe House who is under indictment and investigation, despite the \nreports that other Members of Congress are going to plead guilty or are \nfacing prosecution. Despite all of this, there are no basic changes in \nthe ethics rules that guide us here.\n  There is no effort to take a look at the way we finance political \ncampaigns, which I think is at the root of this whole conversation. \nUnless and until we reach a point that we take the millions of dollars \nout of political campaigns and bring it back to a point where the \naverage person can seriously consider running for office, until we do \nthat, sadly, all of us who are mere mortals and not millionaires will \nbe spending a lot of time with special interests and wealthy people \nthat we should be spending with the folks we represent and those who \ndon't have well-paid lobbyists roaming the halls of the Capitol.\n  There is no energy policy for America after the runup in gasoline \nprices that crippled family budgets, hurt businesses, and hurt farmers. \nNow the gas prices are starting to come down, and we can breathe a sigh \nof relief. Yet we know in the back of our minds that they can turn it \non a dime and run the prices back up to over $3 a gallon again. Why? We \nhave no energy policy.\n  A President and Vice President from the oil patch have really avoided \nthe obvious. We need to find a way to lessen our dependence upon oil, \nand particularly on imported oil. That means moving toward alternative \nenergy sources. That means more fuel efficiency in our vehicles. For 3 \nof the last 4 years, I offered an increase in the CAFE standards so \nthat the cars and trucks we drive in America are more fuel efficient, \nand I have lost every time, not only because of opposition from the \nother side but some within my own ranks. I think there is now a change, \nan awakening that we have to do something about this situation.\n  Of course, in this Congress, what have we done to increase the \navailability and affordability of health insurance and health care? \nNothing. In fact, we have made it more difficult for the average \nfamily. We have decreased the benefits under Medicare and Medicaid, \nalthough we created the prescription Part D Program, which is, of \ncourse, a windfall for pharmaceutical companies. We didn't give the \nconsumers of America the break they deserved. We have to find a way to \nmake sure that Medicare Part D is affordable. To do that, Medicare \nshould be able to bargain for lower drug prices.\n  My friend, Senator Dorgan from North Dakota, is in the Chamber. He \nhas been working on this issue for a long time, the issue of drug \nimportation from Canada and other places. I salute him for his success \nin bringing the issue forward. I share his frustration that we cannot \nseem to get the Republican leadership, which has promised time and \nagain an opportunity for a vote, to actually have that vote and to \nchange the law so that a lot of seniors and others across America can \nget affordable prescription drugs.\n  There is no effort here to make sure people who are vulnerable don't \nhave\n\n[[Page S9652]]\n\nto worry about whether their health care or pensions will be there when \nit is time to retire. We just don't address that in this Congress. You \nsee, sadly, these people cannot afford the lobbyists that other special \ninterests can. Those articulate, well-paid, well-fed, well-dressed \nlobbyists who work right here in this building spend a lot of time in \nour faces. We need to talk to them because, frankly, they finance many \nof our campaigns. It is a sad reality that ought to change. It won't \nchange until the leadership in Congress wakes up to the need for \nchange, the need for a new direction on Capitol Hill.\n  Last Monday night, we had a commemoration of the fifth anniversary of \n9/11. I guess about a hundred of us--Members of Congress--stood on the \nCapitol steps near the same place we stood 5 years ago as a Congress. \nThere were some stirring remarks made, prayers said, and we closed with \nthe singing of ``God Bless America.'' As we sang ``God Bless America,'' \nI thought for a moment that we needed to recapture the spirit of 5 \nyears ago because we left that historic moment on the Capitol steps and \nDemocrats and Republicans rolled up their sleeves in the House and \nSenate and said: What can we do to make America safe? In lightening \nfashion, we enacted a resolution which declared war on those who had \nattacked us.\n  I don't vote for war lightly, but I voted for that without \nhesitation, a war in Afghanistan, against al-Qaida, against the \nTaliban. It was the right thing to do. But today it is a war that we \nknow has not been won. Five years later, it still has not been won. The \nranks of al-Qaida on 9/11/2001 were estimated to be 20,000 worldwide. \nToday our intelligence sources say it is up to 50,000 and growing. The \ntrend is in the wrong direction.\n  We wanted to turn the light out on al-Qaida when we voted for that \nresolution. We wanted to capture Osama bin Laden. We wanted to say to \nthe world: You will pay if you attack the United States.\n  But today we are still fighting, and the commanders in Afghanistan \ntell us we are not doing as well as we should. We need more military \nforces. We need more of an effort.\n  Sadly, we may be losing that war, and we cannot afford to lose that \nwar. Just a few months ago this administration announced it was \ndisbanding the intelligence agency that was going to hunt down Osama \nbin Laden. Again, the Senators from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad and Mr. \nDorgan, came to the floor last week and offered an amendment that was \nadopted unanimously to refund that effort to go after Osama bin Laden.\n  I don't believe capturing him will end the war on terrorism. I don't \nthink it will guarantee Americans are safe, but it certainly is \nsomething we should do as a Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). If the distinguished minority \nwhip will cease for a second, the previous Presiding Officer of the \nSenate did not announce what should have been announced, which is, \nunder the previous order, there will be a period for the transaction of \nmorning business, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes \neach. The distinguished minority whip has spoken in excess of 10 \nminutes. I want to make him aware that is why I stopped him, unless he \nasks unanimous consent to continue.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I know my colleague is waiting to speak, \nso I will hold myself to that 5 minutes.\n  When we came back after 9/11, we gathered together on a bipartisan \nbasis. We passed the PATRIOT Act. We initiated this military effort \nagainst those who attacked us on 9/11. There was a true spirit of \nbipartisanship.\n  Sadly, things broke down. They broke down when we invaded Iraq, and \nthey haven't gotten well since. The President's decision to move \nforward with the invasion of Iraq with Great Britain by our side, but \nreally with the American troops in the forefront, with the American \ntaxpayers paying the bill, has divided us as a Nation. A majority of \nAmericans today question whether that was the right decision. I \nquestion whether that was the right decision. I was one of 23 who voted \nagainst going to war. I did not believe the intelligence supported it.\n  Events that have happened since--we have lost 2,671 of our best and \nbravest and finest American soldiers. They have given their lives in \nthat war in Iraq; 19,000 or more have returned seriously injured. We \nhave spent over $320 billion. We spend anywhere from $1.5 billion to $3 \nbillion a week on a war with no end in sight.\n  We went through this administration's effort to redefine torture to \nabandon the Geneva Conventions that we had stood by for decades. We saw \nthe scandals of Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo.\n  Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., a noted historian, said the issue of torture \nhas damaged the image of America in the world more than anything in our \nhistory. That is a sweeping statement from a man who has spent his life \nmeasuring history and its impact on the world. He believes torture \nunder the Bush-Cheney administration has damaged our reputation more \nthan anything in our history.\n  Thank goodness Senator John McCain stood up and rallied us on a \nbipartisan basis by a vote of 90 to 9 to say torture is not part of \nAmerica's policy. Yet again we are debating this issue, as the Bush \nadministration comes to us and says: When it comes to the treatment of \ndetainees, we cannot stand by the Geneva Conventions. We have to \nredefine it. And they go further.\n  The Bush administration insists that if anyone in the administration \nhas been guilty of wrongdoing--the use of torture, cruel, inhuman, \ndegrading treatment--they should be absolved from any criminal \nliability. What does that say to the world about our standards and \nvalues in the United States?\n  I am glad GEN Colin Powell spoke out yesterday. He hit the nail on \nthe head. If this is a moral position we are taking to opposing terror, \nwe cannot support the President's proposal for the treatment of \ndetainees. And I salute, again, the four Republicans who stood up \nyesterday in the Armed Services Committee and had the courage to speak \nup and say there is a better way. There is a better way to protect \nAmerica and not lose our values.\n  I hope we listen to them when we bring this bipartisan measure to the \nSenate floor. The same thing happened in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. We are adrift when it comes to this wiretapping issue. We \nreported out three different bills. The committee couldn't make up its \nmind.\n  On one of the bills, we said to the President: You are Commander in \nChief. You have the power to do what you wish. Another bill that \nSenator Feinstein has introduced, which I support and is bipartisan, \nsays take the FISA law, the bill that governs wiretapping, gives the \nPresident the time he needs to do what is right, go after al-Qaida, \nwiretap his conversations, stop terror before it occurs, but do it in \nthe framework of the law. The Feinstein bipartisan approach is a \nsensible approach. It is one that honors the tradition of the rule of \nlaw in America.\n  We have two bipartisan approaches now to the treatment of detainees, \nas reported by the Armed Services Committee and to wiretapping as \nreported from the Judiciary Committee with the Feinstein amendment. \nLet's return to that spirit of 9/11/2001. Let's return to that \nbipartisan spirit and get this done and get it done right. At least we \nwill be able to point to that achievement as this Congress draws to a \nclose.\n  I salute my Republican colleagues who stood up for principle and \nvalues that we all should share in America. I hope this administration \nover the weekend will reevaluate their position. I hope they will move \nforward with us in a bipartisan fashion to make America safe but do it \nthe American way.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I advise the Senator, the Senate is in morning \nbusiness, with speeches limited to 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/15/senate-section/article/S9652-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9652-S9654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           INDIAN HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to speak about a subject that is \nvery important dealing with Indian health. I believe there will be an \nattempt to\n\n[[Page S9653]]\n\nmove legislation by consent in the Senate dealing with the \nreauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. We have had \ndifficulty moving that legislation. Senator McCain and I and others \nworked on completing the legislation. It has not yet moved. My hope is \nthat it can move through the Senate without objection today.\n  I want to describe why it is important because in this country, there \nis a lot of noise about a lot of issues. People often talk about the \nnoise of democracy. Sometimes that noise of democracy is a very welcome \nnoise and wonderful sound, but there are other times when it is shrill \nand partisan and the noise of democracy is not such a comfortable \nnoise.\n  In the midst of all the discussions about all of these issues, there \nare day-to-day issues that affect peoples' lives, especially health \ncare. On Indian reservations in this country, there is a very special \nchallenge with respect to health care. We have a trust responsibility \nfor Indians and their health care. We don't meet that responsibility \nvery well.\n  There is wholesale rationing going on with respect to health care for \nAmerican Indians. Nobody likes to talk about it. Around 60 percent of \nhealth care needs of American Indians are being met, and about 40 \npercent of the needs are unmet. That estimate comes from the Indian \nHealth Service. It is not one they advertise, but it is one you can pry \nout of them if you are persistent enough.\n  We spent twice as much money per person on health care for Federal \nprisoners than we do to support our trust responsibility of health care \nfor American Indians.\n  Let me say that again. We have a responsibility for the health care \nof Federal prisoners because they are incarcerated. We spend twice as \nmuch per person for their health care than we do to provide the health \ncare that we are responsible to provide to American Indians. That ought \nnot be a source of pride for anybody in this Chamber or the other \nChamber who is involved in the discussions about these issues.\n  Let me describe, if I might, through the stories of a couple of \nNative Americans, what they face with respect to health care and why \nthere is such an urgency to pass the Indian Health Care Improvement \nAct. That reauthorization is long overdue, and I hope it will be \naccomplished today in the Senate.\n  Let me tell you about an 80-year-old elder who is a diabetic and \nliving on an Indian reservation. This 80-year-old diabetic fell while \ntending to her garden and broke her leg in two places. The break was so \nsevere that there was a bone sticking out of her ankle. This 80-year-\nold woman went to the hospital. The doctor sent her home with \npainkillers.\n  She then went to another hospital and was told the condition was not \npriority 1, which means ``life or limb,'' and, therefore, she was not \nable to get care.\n  She went to a third hospital, limped in, and finally received some \ncare--the third stop, with a bone sticking out of her leg.\n  What is this ``life or limb''? It means that under what is called \ncontract care for American Indians--one tribal chairman on a \nreservation in my State said, we understand: Don't get sick after June. \nIf you do, there is not any money available to you. If it is not ``life \nor limb,'' if it doesn't threaten your life or limb, we are sorry, you \nare out of luck; no health care service for you.\n  Another American Indian with diabetes called in for a prescription \ndrug refill for insulin. He was told he should come in and get blood \nwork done first. It was 2 weeks before he could get that blood work. So \nhe was without the insulin he needed for almost 2 weeks. As a result, \nthis person will likely require dialysis because he couldn't get his \nprescription filled in a timely manner.\n  This is a picture of a woman who said it was all right for me to use \nher picture. Her name is Lida Bearstail. Lida Bearstail went to a \nclinic because of knee pain. Her condition was one in which the \ncartilage had worn away in her knee so that the bones in her knee were \nrubbing against each other, causing her great pain and great \ndiscomfort.\n  If that happened to us or one of our families with our health care \nsystem, my guess is a doctor would recommend knee replacement surgery, \nand we would go in and have some knee replacement surgery. But her pain \nand her limb and the cartilage being gone and bone rubbing against bone \nwas not deemed life or limb or a ``priority 1'' medical condition. She \nwas just given pain medication. She tried a second time. Again denied.\n  The question is: What would happen with us? We would get knee \nsurgery. What happens to Lida Bearstail? She limps, has trouble \nwalking, and probably someday will not be able to walk. Knee surgery is \nnot in her future. It is not life or limb, not a priority, not a \npriority for Lida.\n  Let me describe the circumstances of another woman. And she also has \ngiven me permission to use her picture. This is Ardel Hale Baker. I \nwant to tell you about Ardel Hale Baker. A couple of months ago, she \nhad chest pain--very serious chest pain--that wouldn't quit. Her blood \npressure was very high. So she went to the Indian Health Service \nclinic, and she was diagnosed as having a heart attack. She needed to \nbe sent immediately to the nearest major hospital.\n  They said: You need to go in an ambulance.\n  She said: Is there a chance I can go in something other than an \nambulance? She was thinking--she was having a heart attack, but she was \nthinking: ``I am going to get billed for this and I don't have any \nmoney,'' because if you are not ``priority 1,'' you may end up having \nto pay the bill. And if you don't have the money, it ruins your credit \nrating and credit companies come after you.\n  Anyway, she said: I would not like to go in an ambulance. Can I go in \na private vehicle?\n  They said: No, you have to go in an ambulance.\n  When she arrived at the hospital, the nursing staff was lifting her \noff the gurney and putting her on a hospital bed. As they lifted Ardel \nHale Baker off the gurney, they found something taped to her leg. This \nwoman was having a heart attack, and they found a piece of paper--this \npiece of paper--taped to her leg.\n  It had her name on it. It says: Hale, Ardel. Then it says: ``You have \nreceived outpatient medical services. This letter is to inform you your \npriority 1 care cannot be paid for due to funding issues.''\n  So this woman is taken off a gurney to be placed on a hospital bed, \nhaving a heart attack, and a hospital worker finds a piece of paper \ntaped to her leg saying: Oh, by the way, this isn't ``priority 1.'' \nThis won't be paid for.\n  This sort of incident is unbelievable, and it is going on in this \ncountry in Third World conditions on Indian reservations because the \nhealth care that is available--or should be available--is not available \nunder the circumstances in which it is needed. Again, we have a tribal \nchairman that has said in public hearings in the Congress: ``On our \nreservation, we understand. Don't get sick after June because the money \nhas run out and you are not going to get health care.'' So we have a \nwoman going into a hospital with a paper taped to her leg, having a \nheart attack, that says, ``We are sorry, this won't be paid for.''\n\n  If ever there is an understanding of the need for fast \nreauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, that ought \nto be it.\n  I expect Senator McCain and I and others who have worked for months \non this piece of legislation--in fact, for several years on this piece \nof legislation--I expect all of us share the same hope today: that the \nSenate will have advanced this measure and given some hope to people \nwho are waiting for improvement in health care on Indian reservations. \nIn too many cases, there are people who feel left out, left behind. \nThey feel hopeless and helpless.\n  I have spoken on this floor about a young girl named Avis Littlewind. \nAvis Littlewind was 14 years old when she killed herself. She, like \nothers, as we find clusters of teenage suicides on reservations, \napparently felt there was no hope. She laid in her bed for 90 days, \nmissing 90 days of school. Her sister committed suicide 2 years prior \nto that.\n  The fact is, when you go talk to these kids--and I have, I talked to \nAvis Littlewind's classmates. I went to the Standing Rock Reservation \nand talked to a group of kids with no other adults present. They were \nhigh school kids, and I talked to them about their lives. There was a \ncluster of teenage suicides\n\n[[Page S9654]]\n\non that reservation. We understand that just the basics we expect don't \nexist for them--the basic mental health treatment. When they reach out, \nthere is no one there. One woman was in tears as she said: We don't \nhave proper mental health treatment. We don't have enough of it here. \nIn order to transport a kid who needs to see a professional, I would \nneed to borrow a car. I would need to beg somebody to give me a car to \ntake them to someone who can see them.\n  That is what is going on. This country can do better than that. We \nhave a responsibility to do better than that. We have a trust \nresponsibility for these health care needs. My hope is that today the \nSenate will agree by unanimous consent to pass the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act, the reauthorization that is so long overdue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/15/senate-section/article/S9654-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9654-S9657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       UNITED STATES-OMAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, on behalf of the Republican leader, I now \nask that the Senate proceed to Calendar No. 565, H.R. 5684, as provided \nfor under the order of September 14, 2006; provided further that at the \nconclusion of my remarks on H.R. 5684, the Senate proceed to a period \nof morning business with Senators permitted to speak up to 10 minutes \neach.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5684) to implement the United States-Oman Free \n     Trade Agreement.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota controls up to 60 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, that probably isn't good news to some, but \nthat is the way it is. I want to talk about the Oman Free Trade \nAgreement.\n  It is unbelievable to me that in a week in which there was an \nannouncement, on Thursday morning, that the trade deficit for 1 month \nhas now reached $68 billion--a $68 billion 1-month trade deficit--in \nthat week we bring to the floor of the U.S. Senate the Oman Free Trade \nAgreement. We must have a bowling alley in our brain or something. The \nOman Free Trade Agreement. What on Earth can be rattling around in the \ncollective brains of public servants? Well, maybe I should modify that. \nMaybe I shouldn't be quite so harsh.\n  Look, we are up to our necks. We are choking as a country on trade \ndeficits. Last year it was over $700 billion a year; $2 billion a day \nevery single day. We don't owe that to ourselves, as you can make the \ncase with respect to the budget deficits. We owe that to other \ncountries, and we are going to have to repay it. Over one-half is owed \nto the Chinese and the Japanese. Yet, interestingly enough, when it is \nannounced this week that we have a $68 billion monthly trade deficit, \nthe highest in history, this Congress snored right through it, just \nyawned right on through it, snored through it. So did the White House. \nDid you hear anybody talk about it? No. I came to speak about it \nbriefly, but the fact is, it doesn't matter. Be happy. It is OK. It \nwill be better tomorrow. In fact, let's do more of the same. Let's \nbring another free-trade agreement to the floor of the Senate.\n  We are now negotiating nine of them--nine new trade agreements. This \nfree-trade stuff--you know, the next time I hear people use that term--\nand it is used all the time--free trade, I will want to put a robe on \nthem and get them on a street corner and give them one of those cymbals \nand they can chant. It is nonsense--free trade. It means nothing to me.\n  What means something to me is fair trade. Yes, I believe in trade, \nand plenty of it. Let's expand in trade. Let's demand as a country that \nit be fair. I have on so many occasions given dozens of examples in \nwhich we sell out this country's interests in trade negotiations. I am \nnot going to go through all of that today because I am going to talk \nabout this so-called Oman Free Trade Agreement. But I will, as I \nreserve a portion of my 60 minutes, come back Monday and provide the \nrest of the demonstration of how bankrupt our trade strategy has become \nand how determined virtually all of those who support it are to ignore \nthe bankruptcy of that policy.\n  On June 29 of this year, we sent the Oman Free Trade Agreement from \nthis Chamber, and now it comes back in the form of a conference report. \nOh there are lots of things going on in the world we probably ought to \ntalk a little bit about. We could talk about Iraq, perhaps North Korea, \nIran, or terrorism. We have enormous foreign policy challenges, unlike \nany we have ever seen in our lifetimes. We can talk about domestic \npolicies such as energy prices. We could talk about rising health care \ncosts. We could talk about the fact that the Federal Government is \ngoing to borrow on fiscal policy, budget policy, very close to $600 \nbillion in the coming year. The Federal Government is going to borrow \nfrom foreign countries in trade debt somewhere close to $800 billion in \nthe coming year. That is well over $1.3 trillion in 1 year, or 10 \npercent of the entire GDP of this country.\n  Nobody seems very alarmed about that. They don't want to talk about \nit even. We could talk about all of those things, and perhaps we \nshould. That ought to be the bull's-eye of public policy in terms of \ndoing what we should do in matters that are important, but are we doing \nthat? No. No, we are not doing that. We don't quite have time to do \nthat. We have to deal with the Oman Free Trade Agreement.\n  Let me tell my colleagues, there are about 400 organizations across \nthis country that oppose this free-trade agreement: organized labor, \ncommunications workers, Defenders of Wildlife, Friends of the Earth, \nLeague of Rural Voters, National Farmers Union, the Presbyterian \nChurch, the Sierra Club, the United Methodist Church, United Students \nAgainst Sweatshops, the Western Organization of Resource Councils. So \nit is a pretty significant group of interests around this country that \noppose this trade agreement. Not that they have anything against the \ncountry of Oman; most of us have never been to Oman. It is just that \nthis country has a responsibility to start fixing the massive problems \nit has created in previous trade agreements before negotiating new \nones. As I said, there are nine being negotiated, and they are all \ngoing to come through here, and we will have compliant Members of the \nSenate deciding that.\n  Before they come, do you know what we would like to do? We would like \nto put a straightjacket on ourselves so that we can be prevented from \noffering amendments. God forbid that we have an original thought and \nactually offer an amendment to improve a free-trade agreement. We will \ndo something called fast track and prevent ourselves from offering any \namendments. So that is what will happen.\n  Let me tell my colleagues about the ugly side of free trade, if I \nmight. It is called sweatshops, sweatshops in Jordan. This is from the \nNew York Times, by the way. It says that we did a free-trade agreement \nwith Jordan, which is the only trade agreement done under the Clinton \nadministration, the only trade agreement that had labor protections in \nthe agreement--the only one. Oman doesn't, and none of the others do, \nbut this one had protections for workers in the agreement, which I very \nstrongly support.\n  But let me tell my colleagues about workers in Jordan. Despite the \nfact this trade agreement with Jordan actually had protections for \nworkers, here is what was happening in Jordan. We had people coming \nover to Jordan, being sent over to Jordan from Bangladesh and from \nother very poor countries, and they were working in sweatshops. They \nwere promised $120 a month and, in some cases, they were hardly paid at \nall. One worker was paid $50 for 5 months of work. At some factories, \n40-hour shifts were common.\n  Let me say that again. Not 40-hour workweeks--40-hour shifts. So we \nhad people not being paid, or being paid miserably poor wages, and \nbeing worked 40-hour shifts. There were frequent beatings of workers \nwho complained. And these factories in Jordan were flying in plane \nloads of workers from countries such as Bangladesh to work in slave-\nlike conditions. Then they fly in Chinese materials, in this case \ntextiles, to those same factories,\n\n[[Page S9655]]\n\nand what you end up with is workers who are working, in many cases, \n120 hours a week, turning Chinese cloth into clothing to be sent to the \nUnited States.\n\n  So the consumer says: Isn't that nice. Well, it is not nice. The \nconsumer doesn't understand where it is made and the conditions under \nwhich it is made. If it happened here today, we would get law \nenforcement, drive down the street, open those factories' doors and \narrest the folks who were employing those people. We have already had \nthese examples which have been highly embarrassing to people who want \nto market products made in sweatshops. We all heard Kathy Lee Gifford \ncry when her products were made in sweatshops, and even Puff Daddy, I \nguess he actually changed his name to Puff Daddy and then just Diddy. I \ndon't know what that is about. But Sean Combs--Puff Daddy--who was \nhaving his clothes made in Honduras--and we had two women from that \nfactory in Honduras come and testify here about the conditions.\n  Now, contrary to many others, let me say a word for Puff Daddy, P. \nDiddy or Diddy or whatever his name might be. He actually took an \ninterest. When he discovered those contracting to produce his clothing \nwere putting people in conditions like that, he actually changed things \nin Honduras where those shirts were made. So I say: Good for him. But \nmy point is, this is going on all over the world. When we see these \nexamples of sweatshops, this is being done in the country of Jordan \nwhere we have these labor standards in our agreement. It didn't matter. \nThey flew in Bangladeshi workers and Chinese textiles to produce \nproducts to send to the United States to be sold to big box retailers. \nAnd we are supposed to compete against that? And we lose half our \ntextile industry in this country. Why? Because they can't compete. They \nare told: You can't compete; it is over. That is why we don't make one \npair of Levi's in America. Did you know that? There is not one pair of \nLevi's made in America.\n  I have talked before about the dancing grapes of Fruit of the Loom \nunderwear. There was one guy dressed up as white grapes, another guy \ndressed up as red grapes, and they danced on television and sung about \nhow wonderful their Fruit of the Loom underwear was. Not one pair of \nFruit of the Loom underwear is now made in the United States, and not \none pair of Levi's. I actually brought a picture of the grapes. We \ndon't know who these guys are. All I know is they are no longer \nAmerican grapes, they are Mexican grapes because Fruit of the Loom went \nto Mexico and they went to China.\n  So the point is this: We have a serious trade problem. It is not just \ntextiles, it is not just manufacturing. One-half of the Fortune 500 \ncompanies are now outsourcing software development.\n  I told the story on the floor of the Senate about Natasha Humphreys, \na young woman I spoke to on the phone not too long ago. She did \neverything right. She is a young African-American woman who went to \nStanford. She got her college degree and then went to work for Palm \nPilot. By the way, her last job at Palm Pilot before she lost her job \nwas to train her successor from India who would work for one-fifth of \nthe price. So my point is, it is not just manufacturing and textiles, \nit is high tech, it is many other jobs as well.\n  In fact, there are some leading economists who say there are 40 \nmillion to 50 million additional American jobs that are subject to \noutsourcing. So what do we do? We negotiate new free-trade agreements, \nthis one with Oman.\n  Let me talk about Oman for a moment. Oman is a country of 3 million \npeople. One-half of the people--excuse me--one-half of 1 million of \nthose people are actually foreign guest workers. And the majority of \nOman's workers involved in manufacturing or construction are not from \nOman. The majority of workers are foreigners brought in from Bangladesh \nand Sri Lanka, Indonesia, under labor contracts to work construction \nand factories.\n  So here is what the 2004 U.S. State Department said about human \nrights in Oman. Our U.S. State Department cited the country of Oman for \ncases of forced labor, and in 2004 put out this 2004 report on human \nrights in Oman:\n\n       The law prohibits forced or compulsory labor, including of \n     children. However, there were reports that such practices \n     occurred. The government did not investigate or enforce the \n     law effectively. Foreign workers at times were placed in \n     situations amounting to forced labor.\n\n  So we now do a free-trade agreement with Oman. It doesn't matter to \nus. Whatever happens, happens, I guess. By the way, the Sultan of Oman, \n2\\1/2\\ years ago, issued a Sultanic decree which categorically denies \nworkers the right to organize. So we are going to sign up to a free-\ntrade agreement with them. The Sultan of Oman, however, has written to \nthe USTR and promised he will improve labor laws by October of this \nyear--coincidentally, 1 month after we vote on the Oman Free Trade \nAgreement.\n\n  The Finance Committee of the Senate held a mock markup, I guess it \nwas. They called it a mock markup; they marked up the Oman Free Trade \nAgreement. When they did that, Senators Conrad and Bingaman offered an \namendment that said sweatshop products made in Oman under slave-like \nconditions would not be allowed under this free-trade agreement. That \npassed unanimously in the mock markup.\n  It is pretty unbelievable that we have a mock markup. In fact, with \nsome markups, we may not even have to name them ``mock markups,'' but \nnonetheless they named this a ``mock markup.''\n  In the mock markup, two of my colleagues offered an amendment that \nsaid sweatshop products made in Oman under slave-like conditions will \nnot be allowed under the Oman trade deal. That passed unanimously. But \nthis trade deal which is before the Senate now, just a couple of months \nlater, doesn't have that. It just got dropped. Is there somebody out \nthere who is supporting having products coming in made under slave-like \nconditions in Oman? Is that how it got dropped? If that is so, who is \nthat? Might we have their names? Is there anybody in this Chamber, \nanybody in the Senate who would volunteer that they support products \nbeing produced in sweatshops under slave-like conditions, and because \nthey support that they objected to this amendment and demanded the \namendment be dropped, an amendment which was passed unanimously in a \nmock markup? It is unbelievable to me, what is going on around here.\n  Let me mention something else. As you know, earlier this year we had \na situation where a company owned by the United Arab Emirates, called \nDubai Ports World, got the contract to manage American ports at six \nAmerican cities. The contract to manage America's seaports became very \ncontroversial. I was involved in it because I don't think we ought to \nhave a company owned by the United Arab Emirates managing our seaports. \nNo aspersions against the United Arab Emirates. It seems to me, at a \ntime when we are talking about the issue of security at America's \nseaports, which can be among the most vulnerable of American targets, \nit doesn't seem to be very smart to say: Let's turn the management of \nour seaports over to the United Arab Emirates or to a company owned by \nthem. It just doesn't seem smart to me.\n  There were objections. There was a firestorm of objection from the \nCongress, Republicans and Democrats. The President said: I endorse the \ntakeover of the shipping operations at six major U.S. seaports, and he \npledged to veto any bill Congress might approve that would block the \nagreement. He said: If you pass a bill that says the UAE company, Dubai \nPorts World, can't manage seaports, I am going to veto the bill. But \nthen they got, I think, Dubai Ports World to agree to back away \nsomehow. They have not yet divested, but they are trying to find \nsomeone else to manage these ports.\n  But I want to make sure everybody understands. In this free-trade \nagreement--here is what is in the free-trade agreement with Oman, and \nit has been in previous free-trade agreements as well. There is a \nprovision in this agreement that says we cannot block Oman from \nacquiring some things. Under the free-trade agreement, we cannot block \nOman from acquiring landside aspects of port activities, including \noperation and maintenance of docks, loading and unloading of vessels, \nmarine cargo handling, operation of piers--in effect, we have a \nprovision that protects, for example, Oman's right to be managing \nAmerica's seaports.\n\n[[Page S9656]]\n\n  I don't understand how this works. Maybe somebody looking at me and \nlistening to me will say: Hey, you don't. But I really don't understand \nthe logic of putting in a free-trade agreement preferred activities \nthat say we are going to protect the right of Oman to run America's \nport system; they have a right to do that.\n  Someone else will say to me: That is true, that is what is in the \nfree-trade agreement, but there is also a circumstance where the \nPresident can override that as a result of national security.\n  Yes, but this President has already said he fully supports having a \nforeign government-controlled company running America's seaports. He is \nwrong about that; he is just dead wrong. He needs to rethink that \nposition. But if we have a President who already said: I believe we \nought to have a foreign company run America's seaports, and it is fine \nwith me whether it is the UAE or Oman, there is no provision here that \nis a failsafe provision so that the President will decide: OK, I \nunderstand it is in the free-trade agreement they can do that, but I am \ngoing to invoke some sort of national security objection.\n\n  My sense is that most people do not know this is here, or if they \nknow it is here, either they do not care or they think it is fine, to \nturn over the ports in New York and New Jersey and Florida and \nLouisiana to foreign control, foreign management.\n  We have spent a lot of time here this week talking about port \nsecurity. I think we have 7 million containers coming into this country \non container ships. We are going to spend $10 billion this year, \nroughly, to protect us against an incoming missile with a nuclear \nwarhead on it. We are worried about a rogue nation or terrorist group \nacquiring an intercontinental ballistic missile and putting a nuclear \nweapon on the tip, so we are trying to create a catcher's mitt, in \neffect trying to hit a bullet with a bullet. We are going to spend $10 \nbillion this year.\n  The most likely threat, of course, is that 1 of the 7 million \ncontainers that comes into this country has in it a weapon of mass \ndestruction, perhaps a stolen nuclear weapon from the Russian arsenal, \nand it pulls up to an American dock--not at 17,000 miles an hour, but \nit pulls up at 2 or 3 miles an hour and it pulls up to a pier at a \nmajor American city and we have a detonation of a nuclear weapon. That \nis far more likely than having a rogue nation or terrorist group \nacquire an ICBM. But we spend pennies on that and spend billions of \ndollars trying to create a catcher's mitt, trying to hit a bullet with \na bullet in the sky. It is beyond me how this fits any thoughtful \nlogic, and it is beyond me how this provision in a trade agreement \nprovides individuals any security for this country at all. It does not. \nIt injures this country's opportunity for good security, in my opinion.\n  This trade agreement really needs to be defeated. It will probably \nnot be because we don't have thoughtful debates. We by and large have \npretty thoughtless minidebates about trade these days. But I think one \nof these days, when the trade deficit is announced--this week at $68 \nbillion just for 1 month, $800 billion a year--one of these days, the \nAmerican people are going to say: Wait a second, doesn't that mean we \nare selling our country?\n  And the answer is yes. Today is Friday. We will import from other \ncountries about $2 billion more in value of property than we will \nexport to other countries. That means we will pay for that by putting \ncurrency in the hands of others. Over half of it will be in the hands \nof the Chinese and Japanese. With that currency, they then buy part of \nour country--stocks, bonds, companies, real estate. We are literally \nselling part of our country every single day to the tune of $2 billion \na day.\n  Don't take it from me; take it from Warren Buffett and many others \nwho understand that this is unsustainable. Two years ago, Alan \nGreenspan said that when you reach 5 percent of your GDP as a trade \ndeficit, you are reaching waters--levels that are unsustainable and are \ngoing to cause serious economic harm. Now we are well over that 2 years \nlater. He was right then, and he is right now.\n  We have to take action. This country has to care and begin to take \naction. You can't continue to sell part of your country. You can't \nconsume 6 percent more than you produce year after year and then pay \nforeigners to produce it for us and put it in their hands, currency \nwith which they buy this country.\n  I noticed the other day that we sold Wham-O to the Chinese. It is \nprobably not a big deal--Hula Hoops, Frisbees, and Slip `N Slide. Every \nkid knows Wham-O. But if you take a look at what is being transferred \nfrom this country--our assets, company after company--to the Chinese \nand then you evaluate whether this is sustainable and whether this is \nthe course on which America wants to remain, the answer should be no.\n  I haven't talked much about jobs. I will do that, I believe, on \nMonday prior to the time we will have a vote on the Oman Free Trade \nAgreement. But this is about the economic health and strength of our \ncountry. No country will long remain a world economic power without a \nstrong manufacturing base, and no country will remain a world economic \npower without being able to expand its middle-class people. We have \ndone that in a century. We have expanded the middle class and created \neconomic growth unlike we have ever seen on this Earth. And now we are \nbeginning to see that taken apart, people having more trouble finding a \ngood-paying job.\n  Incidentally, of all the things we work on in this Chamber, there is \nno social program as important as a good job that pays well. We are now \nseeing American workers being told: You are going to compete against \nothers who will work for 30 cents an hour. That means lower wages for \nyou. We require higher productivity; we are going to give you lower \nwages and less retirement.\n  It takes apart the social compact we built in this country, that \nexpansion of the middle class which created the economic expansion \nwhich created the greatest economy on the face of this Earth.\n  For all those reasons, this is a horrible trade agreement. I just \ntouched on a part of it. I will finish on Monday. This is another \nchapter in a sad book of failures that no one wants to read very \ncarefully. But my hope is that one of these days this Senate will wake \nup, this Congress will wake up, this President will wake up and decide: \nNo more free-trade agreements. Let's fix the problems we have created \nbefore we negotiate new ones. Yes, let's have a goal of expanding \ntrade. Trade can be good, but trade between trading partners must be \nmutually beneficial, and trade agreements that are free but not fair \nundermine this country's interests. We should aspire to have fair trade \nagreements that expand our opportunities, not retard our capabilities; \nhelp lift others up, not push us down. That ought to be our goal.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to dispel claims being put \nforward by some that the U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement will threaten \nU.S. national security. These critics of the agreement claim that it \nwill give foreign port operators an absolute right to establish or \nacquire operations to run port facilities in the United States. They \ncontend that, in this way, the U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement could \nharm our national security. These claims are just plain wrong.\n  First of all, the U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement provides no new \nrights for Omanis or others to supply port related services in the \nUnited States. Omani companies are presently able to supply such \nservices. The Oman agreement simply mirrors current U.S. law. So it is \nincorrect for anyone to claim that this trade agreement creates new \nrights for Omanis or others to contract with U.S. port owners to \nperform port services.\n  In addition, U.S.--law specifically the Exon-Florio amendment to the \nDefense Production Act of 1950--authorizes the President to block \nforeign investment that would threaten our national security, including \ninvestments in port operations. The President delegates the authority \nto monitor and review foreign investments to the Committee on Foreign \nInvestment in the United States, or CFIUS. This free-trade agreement \nwill not change the process of CFIUS in reviewing proposed investment \nin the United States. Thus, if the President determines that the \ninvestments of Oman or other countries in port services in the United \nStates\n\n[[Page S9657]]\n\nwill threaten our national security, U.S. law provides that he can \nblock such investments. The U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement in no way \nchanges this existing law.\n  Moreover, the U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement at article 21.2 contains \na ``national security'' exception. This article provides that nothing \nin the agreement can prevent the United States from taking any action \nthat we consider necessary to protect our essential security interests. \nThis exception is self-judging, which means that solely the United \nStates can decide what constitutes our essential security interests. \nContrary to the claims of some critics, neither an investor-state \narbitration tribunal nor a dispute settlement panel has the authority \nto second-guess what the United States determines to be in its \nessential security interest. After all, once the United States invokes \nthe national security exemption, there's nothing for a tribunal or \npanel to review.\n  So it is clear that the U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement doesn't \ndiminish the right of the United States to determine whether to block \nany foreign investment in our country, including in port services. It \nis also clear that the Oman trade agreement doesn't create any new \nrights for Oman to supply port related services in the United States. \nAnyone who says otherwise is ignoring the facts.\n  The U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement will benefit the United States. It \nwill not pose security threats for the United States. If it did, I \nwouldn't be supporting it. I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 5684, \nthe U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/15/senate-section/article/S9657-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today marks a victory for government \ntransparency and a victory for democratic accountability. By passing \nthe Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006, the \nHouse of Representatives and the Senate have brought a little much-\nneeded sunlight to the world of government spending.\n  This bill requires the Office of Management and Budget to ensure that \na free, searchable Web site is available to Americans to access \ninformation about Federal grants, contracts, loans, and other financial \nassistance. The Web site will make public important oversight \ninformation including the name and location of an entity receiving an \naward, a description of the purpose of the funding, the amount of \nfunding, the type of transaction, the primary location of performance \nunder the award, the funding agency, and any other relevant information \nspecified by the Office of Management and Budget. Existing Federal \ndatabases, such as the Federal Procurement Data System, FPDS, the \nFederal Assistance Award Data System, FAADS, and Grants.gov, contain \nother public information that may also be made available through the \nnew Web site.\n  Current law requires that certain information related to the use of \ncompetitive or noncompetitive procedures in procurements be included in \nFPDS. Executive agencies must provide competition information for each \nprocurement transaction, including the extent to which the procurement \nwas subject to competitive procedures, the type of solicitation \nprocedure used, whether the procurement was awarded using a \nsocioeconomic program set-aside, and, when applicable, the reason for a \nnon-competitive procurement. This information is available to the \npublic through FPDS.\n  It is my expectation that the Office of Management and Budget will \nensure that all relevant information on the use of competitive or \nnoncompetitive procedures will be included in the information made \navailable through the Web site. Since the collection of this \ninformation is already mandated and the information is made publicly \navailable, its inclusion on the searchable, user-friendly Web site \nshould not cause any additional burden or complexity.\n  Mr. President, I would like to ask my friend from Oklahoma and the \nauthor of this legislation, who has tirelessly fought to improve \ngovernment accountability, if he shares my expectation that the new Web \nsite will include information on the use of competitive procedures.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Senator from Illinois. I share his \nunderstanding of this legislation and also his expectation that the Web \nsite will include information about the use of competitive procedures.\n  Mr. OBAMA. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his leadership on \nthis issue. I am grateful for our partnership to improve the efficiency \nand effectiveness of government services. I am confident that our \nefforts to reduce the use of noncompetitive procedures will save \ntaxpayer money and improve the quality of contracted goods and \nservices.\n  I would also like to inquire of the distinguished chair and ranking \nmember of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee who \nwere instrumental in bringing this legislation through committee and \nensuring its passage by the Senate.\n  I would ask Madam Chairman, if it is her expectation that information \non the use of competitive or noncompetitive procedures for the \nfinancial transactions reported on the Web site created through the \nFederal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 will be \navailable on the Web site, so that citizens will have straightforward \naccess to comprehensive information on federal awards?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I would assure the Senator from Illinois that that is \nindeed my expectation.\n  Mr. OBAMA. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee. The American people are \nwell served by her leadership and the diligence of her excellent staff. \nLet me further note that all of us are well served by the productive \nworking relationship that the chairman shares with the ranking member. \nThe bipartisan nature of this bill is a testament not only to the broad \nsupport for the idea itself but also to the cooperative manner in which \nthe Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee conducts its \nbusiness.\n  So let me ask the committee's ranking member and my good friend from \nthe State of Connecticut, who has long been a champion of good \ngovernment and transparency, whether he shares our understanding that \nthis new Web site will include information on the competitive or \nnoncompetitive procedures used in government contracting for goods and \nservices.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Illinois \nand do expect that publicly available information about the procurement \nprocedures used in government contracting will be made available \nthrough the Web site.\n  Mr. OBAMA. I thank the Senator from Connecticut. It has been my \nprivilege to work with him on this issue. Transparency is the first \nstep to holding government accountable. We can't reduce waste, fraud, \nand abuse or improve fairness and efficiency without knowing how, \nwhere, and why Federal money is being spent. And we cannot ensure that \nAmericans are getting the best quality and the best prices on \ngovernment contracts without being able to evaluate the types of \nprocedures used to procure goods and services. Whether you believe the \ngovernment ought to spend more money or spend less, we can all agree \nthat the government ought to spend every penny efficiently and \ntransparently. If the procedures by which the government spends money, \nor those expenditures themselves, can't withstand public scrutiny, then \nthe taxpayers' money shouldn't be spent. The American people deserve no \nless.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/15/senate-section/article/S9658-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S9658]]\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     Marine Corporal Jordan Pierson\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to speak in honor of U.S. Marine \nCorps Corporal Jordan C. Pierson, of Milford, CT, who was killed in \nIraq on August 25, 2006. He was 21 years old.\n  Corporal Pierson, a member of Charlie Company, 1st Battalion, 25th \nMarine Regiment, died from hostile gunfire while on foot patrol in \nFallujah, Iraq.\n  Corporal Pierson joined the U.S. Marine Corps in December 2003, just \na few months after graduating from Joseph A. Foran High School in \nMilford. He was adamant about his decision to join the Marines. As a \nyoung man who loved the military from an early age, Jordan found his \ncalling in the principles and discipline of the Marine Corps. He \npostponed his studies at the University of Connecticut, where he was \ntaking courses in business and psychology, to serve in Iraq. During his \ndeployment he was wounded by shrapnel from an insurgent grenade and was \nawarded the Purple Heart. After treatment at Camp Fallujah, he bravely \nreturned to combat, exhibiting great dedication to his fellow marines \nand his Nation.\n  Jordan's positive spirit and selflessness were an inspiration to all \nthose around him, whether friends, family, or the men and women he \nserved with in the Marine Corps. He represented the very best features \nof American patriotism. Among his fellow marines, his enthusiasm was \ncontagious, and he often reminded them of the difference they were \nmaking in Iraq. To his childhood friends, he was a refuge in times of \ntrouble and a constant source of entertainment. Never forgetting about \nthe family he left behind, Jordan sent money home every month without \never being asked.\n  People like Corporal Pierson make it possible for us to live each and \nevery day in freedom, peace, and security. They have made the ultimate \nsacrifice to protect their fellow citizens and our Nation, and we must \nnever forget their heroic service.\n  So today I salute the courage and commitment of U.S. Marine Corporal \nPierson, a young man who lived his life to the fullest and died \nfulfilling the noblest of callings, defending our Nation and the values \nwe hold dear. I offer my deepest sympathies and support to his parents, \nEric and Beverley, his brother Ethan, and to everyone who knew and \nloved him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/15/senate-section/article/S9658-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR. ROBERT H. LAMB\n\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I pay special tribute to a \nwonderful man, exceptionally gifted physician, and loving husband, \nfather, and friend--Robert H. Lamb, M.D.\n  I am sad to note that Dr. Lamb recently passed away at his home in \nUtah, leaving a tremendous void in the lives of all who knew him. Dr. \nLamb dedicated his life to the practice of medicine and healing. His \nexample of service and dedication to the health and well-being of \npeople across Utah was truly extraordinary.\n  Dr. Lamb received his medical degree from Jefferson University in \nPhiladelphia and began his medical service as an intern at the \nPennsylvania Hospital. His long and storied medical career included \nservice as a general surgical resident at the original St. Mark's \nHospital in Salt Lake City, followed by service in the U.S. Army as the \nchief of the surgical service in the Station Hospital in Fort Hood, TX. \nAfter his release from the Army, he went on to work as a resident \northopedic surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, OH.\n  In 1951, he moved his young family back to Salt Lake City to begin \nhis medical practice which encompassed work first at Shriner's \nHospital, then the University of Utah Medical Center and St. Mark's \nHospital.\n  During his professional life, he served in many leadership positions, \nincluding the president of the medical staff of St. Mark's Hospital and \nShriner's Hospital; as a board of trustees member of St. Mark's \nHospital, and later as the chairman of the board of St. Mark's. Until \nhis death, he continued to serve as a lifetime honorary ex-officio \nmember of the St. Mark's board of trustees.\n  Dr. Lamb was not only dedicated to his patients, he was dedicated to \nthe field of medicine. He spent years tutoring and mentoring future \nmedical professionals and helped train some of Utah's finest doctors. \nThe knowledge and enthusiasm he shared with all those who had the \nprivilege of working by his side provided the impetus for many future \nphysicians and other dedicated medical personnel.\n  Many of Dr. Lamb's patients have described him as ``gentle'', \n``caring'', and ``dedicated''--all sentiments I share. I had the honor \nof visiting Dr. Lamb as a patient, and I can truly attest to his \nknowledge, compassion, and high-quality care. I appreciated his concern \nfor me and my health and will forever be grateful to him for his \ndedication to medicine.\n  The respected English philosopher and poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge \nbeautifully described what many feel regarding Dr. Lamb's dedication \nand service when he made the statement, ``He is the best physician who \nis the most ingenious inspirer of hope.'' Dr. Lamb always treated his \npatients with utmost care and respect, and above all else he always \nstrived to inspire hope.\n  Dr. Lamb was not only a great physician, but he was also a dedicated \nhusband, father, and grandfather. I know that his wife Mary, and his 5 \nchildren, 10 grandchildren, and 5 great-grandchildren will miss him \ndeeply. My greatest hope is that they will be able to find peace and \ncomfort from the memories they have of his exceptional life.\n  I am grateful that I had the privilege of knowing Dr. Robert Lamb. \nHis life's work has touched literally hundreds of Utahns, and his \nmemory will live on through the better health and well-being he \nimparted to many. The lessons he taught and the service he performed \nleave an indelible imprint which will inspire and teach generations to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/15/senate-section/article/S9658-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/15/senate-section/article/S9658-4", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/15/senate-section/article/S9658-5", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9658-S9659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  The following enrolled bills, previously signed by the Speaker of the \nHouse, were signed today, September 15, 2006, by the President pro \ntempore (Mr. Stevens):\n\n       S. 1773.

A bill to amend chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code, \nto make individuals employed by the Roosevelt Campobello International \nPark Commission eligible to obtain Federal health insurance; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would correct a unique health insurance problem for some American \ncitizens whose work is devoted to maintaining the memory of President \nFranklin D. Roosevelt at his Campobello Island retreat near the Maine \nborder.\n  About 10 U.S. citizens from the State of Maine work in Canada under \nterms of a treaty that governs operation of the Roosevelt Campobello \nInternational Park. As you know, that beautiful island in the Province \nof New Brunswick was President Roosevelt's treasured retreat, and still \ndraws thousands of visitors from around the world.\n  The American employees of the Park are, unfortunately, faced with a \ndifficult problem in obtaining affordable health-insurance coverage. \nThe legislation I introduce today would solve their difficulty by \nmaking them eligible for coverage under the Federal Employees Health \nInsurance Benefits Program.\n  In the spirit of bipartisan recognition that FDR was one of our \ngreatest and most inspiring Presidents, I am delighted to be joined in \nthis effort by Senator Harkin. His endorsement of this bill is \nespecially notable because he serves on the Roosevelt Campobello \nInternational Park Commission, and is thus very familiar with the \ndifficulty of my Maine constituents employed at the Park.\n  The Roosevelt Campobello International Park was dedicated in 1964 as \na unique memorial to former President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Park \nis governed by a treaty between the United States and Canada, and is \nfunded by both governments.\n  The Park employs approximately 10 full-time employees who are \nAmerican citizens residing in Maine. Unfortunately, the treaty that \ngoverns the Park does not address the health insurance needs of \nindividuals employed directly by Roosevelt Campobello International \nPark. As a result, the State Department issued an opinion in 1965 \nstating that those employed by the Park Commission, ``shall be subject \nto the relevant Canadian labor laws.'' Based on the State Department \nopinion, the Civil Service Commission, the predecessor of the Office of \nPersonnel Management, has determined that the employees are not \nconsidered Federal employees eligible for FEHBP coverage.\n  The employees currently receive health insurance coverage through a \nsmall group plan negotiated by the Roosevelt Park Commission. The \npremiums have risen so dramatically that they can no longer afford \ncoverage.\n  The full-time employees are unique in their situation and should be \nincluded under the FEHBP for health insurance purposes. This would be a \nmatter of equal treatment as well as compassion for those workers and \ntheir families. Full-time employees of other parks that share a border \nwith Canada, like Glacier National Park, while technically the shared \nresponsibility of both the United States and Canada, are eligible for \ncoverage under the FEHBP.\n  In addition, the location of the Park makes it impractical for these \nemployees to seek medical treatment in Canada even if the government \nallowed them to join the Canadian health system. The closest doctors \nand hospitals are in Maine, and the Park is only accessible from the \nUnited States.\n  If the treaty were negotiated today, health insurance would certainly \nbe a part of the negotiations. The situation facing this small group of \nRoosevelt Campobello Park employees is a consequence of negotiations \nconducted when health insurance was not a standard employee benefit as \nit is today.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this legislation \nso that U.S. citizens maintaining the Park honoring a great American \nPresident will be treated fairly.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS:\n  S. 3904. A bill to extend the generalized system of preferences \nprogram under the Trade Act of 1974, to extend the Andean Trade \nPreference Act, to extend certain trade preferences under the African \nGrowth and Opportunity Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I introduce the Emergency Trade \nProgram Extension Act of 2006.\n  For more than 30 years, the United States has opened its vast market \nto developing countries through trade preference programs. We have done \nso to encourage greater economic development and openness in those \ncountries. The United States is the largest market in the world. And it \nis also one of the most open. And this openness has played an important \nrole in economic development, both in the United States and around the \nglobe.\n  Two important preference programs are set to expire at the end of \nthis year: the Generalized System of Preferences and the Andean Trade \nPreference Act.\n  I know that some have criticized these programs, GSP in particular, \nfor being unnecessary, inefficient, or counterproductive. They argue \nthat the majority of the imports that benefit from GSP come from just a \nhandful of middle-income countries. And they argue that the truly \npoorest developing countries barely use the program at all. Many of the \nmost active users of GSP--like Brazil, Thailand, Indonesia, and \nArgentina--have developed strong export sectors. This raises the \nquestion of whether they even need preference programs to compete on \nthe world market.\n  And critics charge that big GSP beneficiary countries like India and \nBrazil were among the most recalcitrant in supporting greater market \naccess in the Doha Round negotiations. They claim that the active \nefforts of these countries contributed to the collapse of the Round. \nWhy, they ask, should we keep our markets open to such countries, if \nthey will not open their markets to us?\n  I am not deaf to these criticisms. I think that there is much truth \nin them. But before we allow these important programs simply to expire, \nI believe that we should examine them in detail. We should explore \nwhether and how they might be changed to address valid criticisms. We \nshould understand the effect that canceling them might have on the U.S. \nimage around the world, U.S. diplomatic efforts, and our trade \npriorities in the Doha Round and elsewhere. And we should give those in \nthe United States who rely upon these programs an opportunity to \nexplain how their interests might be adversely affected by cancelling \nGSP and ATPA.\n  The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative recently began a review \nof the GSP program to look at many of these very issues. That review \nwill not be completed until mid-November, at the earliest. I believe \nthat we should preserve the status quo until we in the Congress have \nhad an opportunity to digest the outcome of that review and conduct our \nown analysis.\n  GSP is important to keeping countries engaged in the trade \nliberalization dialogue. For one thing, these countries are interested \nin maintaining benefits under the program. As a result, they are more \nwilling to address concerns that we may raise with them. GSP-\neligibility has given us leverage to address bilateral trade problems--\nsuch as intellectual property protection--and to persuade beneficiary \ncountries to respect international norms on labor rights, human rights, \nand other matters. And as they gain more experience in international \nmarkets, they can see the benefits of liberalization in action. Without \nGSP, those countries might see China or other big exporters take over \ntheir share of our market.\n  Most of the imports from GSP beneficiaries occur outside the program. \nU.S. imports from GSP beneficiary countries in 2005 exceeded $248 \nbillion. Of that, less than $27 billion--less than 10 percent--entered \nduty-free under the GSP program.\n  GSP is much more important to the least developed countries. One-\nthird of the total imports from these countries were under GSP \npreferences. Many of the least developed countries depend on\n\n[[Page S9661]]\n\nGSP to sell their products into the American market. They have worked \nhard to establish export-oriented industries, but still need the extra \nboost provided by GSP or other preference programs.\n  Some of our other preference programs target these very poor \ncountries, including the preferences under the African Growth and \nOpportunity Act and the Caribbean Basin programs. But for a large \nnumber of countries--including Afghanistan, Armenia, Bangladesh, \nBosnia-Herzegovina, Cambodia, and Pakistan--there are no other programs \nto help them compete against other exporters in the U.S. market.\n  GSP is also important to U.S. competitiveness. Raw materials and \ncomponents for further processing make up more than two-thirds of the \nproducts imported under GSP. For example, GSP imports make up a \nsignificant percentage of U.S. total imports of leather processed after \ntanning--45 percent, ferroalloys--37 percent, aluminum sheets--25 \npercent, and copper wire--25 percent.\n  American retailers have taken advantage of the programs to find new \nproducts and new sources of supply. And every year, U.S. consumers save \nmillions of dollars because of GSP duty savings.\n  Trade preferences for our Andean partners have helped curb the \nproduction and smuggling of drugs. Trade can encourage diversification \nout of drug crops, and offer an economic future to people who otherwise \nare easy prey for narcotraffickers. The Andean preference programs play \na significant role in facilitating exports from Colombia, Peru, Ecuador \nand Bolivia. Almost 60 percent of exports from those countries are \ncovered by these preferences.\n  Some argue that trade preferences for the Andean countries are now \nboth unnecessary and ill-advised. They say that the preferences are \nunnecessary because the United States has negotiated free trade \nagreements with Peru and Colombia. And they say that the preferences \nare ill-advised in extending benefits to Bolivia and Ecuador, both of \nwhich have taken actions and made statements recently at variance with \nU.S. interests.\n  While we have negotiated free trade agreements with Peru and \nColombia, neither has passed the U.S. Congress. It is far from clear \nthat the U.S.-Peru agreement will even be considered in Congress before \nthe Andean preference program expires at the end of this year, and \nthere is no chance at all that the U.S.-Colombia agreement will be. We \nshould extend the Andean preference program for these countries to \navoid a lapse in benefits prior to the implementation of any free-trade \nagreement with them. Such a lapse would be disruptive to Peru and \nColombia. And such a lapse would be disruptive to U.S. businesses, as \nwell.\n  It may be that there are good arguments for ending the program with \nrespect to Bolivia and Ecuador. But again, I believe that we should \ngive Congress time to examine these arguments as well as any \ncounterarguments and make a reasoned judgment about the future of the \nprogram.\n  That is why I am sponsoring the Emergency Trade Program Extension Act \nof 2006. This bill will extend both GSP and the Andean Trade Preference \nAct for 2 years. This is a short-term extension to allow the Congress \nto have hearings and consider in depth what should be done with these \nprograms. I do not believe that we should let these programs expire \nwithout the benefit of a thorough analysis of their merits and \nfailings.\n  Some may argue that this legislation is unnecessary. They may say \nthat we can allow these programs to expire, consider them in depth next \nyear, and then renew them retroactively if we so decide. Indeed, we \nhave done that before. But that is very disruptive, both to U.S. \nbusinesses and the countries that rely upon these programs. The \nuncertainty of whether the programs will be renewed retroactively, or \nrenewed at all, undermines the goals of encouraging investment in the \nbeneficiary countries. So we should pass this legislation to maintain \nthe integrity of these programs while we consider what to do with them.\n  This legislation also includes a 1-year extension of the third-\ncountry fabric provisions in the African Growth and Opportunity Act, or \nAGOA. These provisions are currently set to expire in September of next \nyear. Those provisions allow Africa's poorest countries to import \nfabric from countries outside of Africa for use in their apparel \nindustries. These third-country fabric provisions have helped create \njobs in desperately poor countries like Lesotho, where one textile \nworker supports numerous family members. U.S. retailers looking to next \nyear's products are making their sourcing decisions now. If they cannot \nbe confident that Africa will continue to be able to import third-\ncountry fabric, then they will stop sourcing from Africa. And tens of \nthousands of jobs could be lost.\n  This bill is not intended as the final word on AGOA. I fully expect \nthat the next Congress will consider a comprehensive reform of AGOA. \nMany worthwhile ideas have been proposed. But we do not have time to \nconsider them before Africa will begin to feel the effects of the \nexpiration of third-country fabric provisions next fall. We should give \nAfrica breathing space while Congress completes its work.\n  The suspension of the Doha Round negotiations at the World Trade \nOrganization has sparked a period of soul searching and debate in the \ntrade community both here and abroad. Our trade preference programs \nshould be part of that debate. It simply makes no sense to look at \nthese programs in isolation from the wider discussion about the future \nof trade policy. And we cannot look at the future of the trading system \nwithout considering the treatment of developing countries in that \nsystem.\n  For all of these reasons, I am proud to sponsor the Emergency Trade \nProgram Extension Act of 2006. I am proud to note, as well, that this \nbill is a companion to an identical bill introduced yesterday in the \nHouse of Representatives by my friend the ranking Democratic member of \nthe Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Rangel. I applaud his leadership on \nthese issues. And I look forward to working with him to get this \nimportant legislation passed into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/15/senate-section/article/S9661-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9661-S9662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n       SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 116--SUPPORTING ``LIGHTS ON \n    AFTERSCHOOL!'', A NATIONAL CELEBRATION OF AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS\n\n  Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \nBurr, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Cochran, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Specter, Mr. Reed, \nMr. Domenici, Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Snowe, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Murkowski, Ms. \nStabenow, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Biden, Mr. Burns, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Reid, Mr. \nAkaka, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Kerry, Ms. \nLandrieu, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Carper, Mr. Kohl, Mr. \nDayton, Mr. Pryor, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Nelson \nof Nebraska, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Sarbanes, Ms. \nCollins, Mr. Martinez, and Mr. Schumer) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 116\n\n       Whereas high quality after school programs provide safe, \n     challenging, engaging, and fun learning experiences to help \n     children and youth develop their social, emotional, physical, \n     cultural, and academic skills;\n       Whereas high quality after school programs support working \n     families by ensuring that the children in such families are \n     safe and productive after the regular school day ends;\n       Whereas high quality after school programs build stronger \n     communities by involving the Nation's students, parents, \n     business leaders, and adult volunteers in the lives of the \n     Nation's youth, thereby promoting positive relationships \n     among children, youth, families, and adults;\n       Whereas high quality after school programs engage families, \n     schools, and diverse community partners in advancing the \n     well-being of the Nation's children;\n       Whereas ``Lights On Afterschool!'', a national celebration \n     of after school programs held on October 12, 2006, promotes \n     the critical importance of high quality after school programs \n     in the lives of children, their families, and their \n     communities;\n       Whereas more than 28,000,000 children in the United States \n     have parents who work outside the home and 14,300,000 \n     children in the United States have no place to go after \n     school; and\n       Whereas many after school programs across the United States \n     are struggling to\n\n[[Page S9662]]\n\n     keep their doors open and their lights on: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress supports the goals and ideals of \n     ``Lights On Afterschool!'' a national celebration of after \n     school programs.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today Senator Ensign and I, along with 42 \ncosponsors, are submitting a concurrent resolution with the House \ndesignating October 12, 2006 as Lights On Afterschool Day. Lights on \nAfterschool is a national celebration of afterschool programs, designed \nto promote the critical importance of afterschool in the lives of \nAmerica's children, families, and communities. This year alone, we \nexpect over 1 million Americans to participate in this important \ncelebration.\n  Quality afterschool programs keep kids safe, help working families, \nand improve academic achievement. It has been demonstrated that \nchildren in afterschool programs show greater interest in school, learn \nnew skills, exhibit improved behavior and get better grades than their \npeers. Afterschool programs also build stronger communities by \ninvolving our students, parents, business leaders and adult volunteers \nin the lives of our young people, thereby promoting positive \nrelationships among children and adults.\n  In America today, more than 28 million children have parents who work \noutside the home. As many as 15 million of these children have no place \nto go after school and consequently are missing out on important \nopportunities to learn and grow. Two-thirds of Americans say that it is \ndifficult to find programs in their communities and that not enough \nprograms are available.\n  In our work on the Senate Afterschool Caucus, Senator Ensign and I \nhave been working for more than a year to impress upon our colleagues \nthe importance of afterschool and are proud to say that 34 of our \ncolleagues have joined the Caucus to date. We hope that they, along \nwith other Members of the Congress, will join us on October 12th to \ncelebrate the importance of afterschool programs in their communities \nback home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/15/senate-section/article/S9662-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--H.R. 6061\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Senate Advice and Consent Subject to \n     Reservations and Declarations.\n       The Senate advises and consents to the ratification of the \n     United Nations Convention Against Corruption (hereinafter in \n     this resolution referred to as the ``Convention''), adopted \n     by the United Nations General Assembly on October 31, 2003, \n     and signed by the United States on December 9, 2003, at \n     Merida, Mexico (T. Doc. 109-6), subject to the reservations \n     in section 2 and the declarations in section 3.\n       Section 2. Reservations.\n       The advice and consent of the Senate under section 1 is \n     subject to the following reservations, which shall be \n     included in the United States instrument of ratification:\n       (1) The United States of America reserves the right to \n     assume obligations under the Convention in a manner \n     consistent with its fundamental principles of federalism, \n     pursuant to which both federal and state criminal laws must \n     be considered in relation to the conduct addressed in the \n     Convention. U.S. federal criminal law, which regulates \n     conduct based on its effect on interstate or foreign \n     commerce, or another federal interest, serves as an important \n     component of the legal regime within the United States for \n     combating corruption and is broadly effective for this \n     purpose. Federal criminal law\n\n[[Page S9663]]\n\n     does not apply where such criminal conduct does not so \n     involve interstate or foreign commerce, or another federal \n     interest. There are conceivable situations involving offenses \n     of a purely local character where U.S. federal and state \n     criminal law may not be entirely adequate to satisfy an \n     obligation under the Convention. Similarly, in the U.S. \n     system, the states are responsible for preventive measures \n     governing their own officials. While the states generally \n     regulate their own affairs in a manner consistent with the \n     obligations set forth in the chapter on preventive measures \n     in the Convention, in some cases they may do so in a \n     different manner. Accordingly, there may be situations where \n     state and federal law will not be entirely adequate to \n     satisfy an obligation in Chapters II and III of the \n     Convention. The United States of America therefore reserves \n     to the obligations set forth in the Convention to the extent \n     they (1) address conduct that would fall within this narrow \n     category of highly localized activity or (2) involve \n     preventive measures not covered by federal law governing \n     state and local officials. This reservation does not affect \n     in any respect the ability of the United States to provide \n     international cooperation to other States Parties in \n     accordance with the provisions of the Convention.\n       (2) The United States of America reserves the right not to \n     apply in part the obligation set forth in Article 42, \n     paragraph 1(b) with respect to the offenses established in \n     accordance with the Convention. The United States does not \n     provide for plenary jurisdiction over offenses that are \n     committed on board ships flying its flag or aircraft \n     registered under its laws. However, in many circumstances, \n     U.S. law provides for jurisdiction over such offenses \n     committed on board U.S.-flagged ships or aircraft registered \n     under U.S. law. Accordingly, the United States shall \n     implement paragraph 1(b) to the extent provided for under its \n     federal law.\n       Section 3. Declarations.\n       (a) The advice and consent of the Senate under section 1 is \n     subject to the following declaration:\n       The United States of America declares that, in view of its \n     reservations, current United States law, including the laws \n     of the States of United States, fulfills the obligations of \n     the Convention for the United States. Accordingly, the United \n     States of America does not intend to enact new legislation to \n     fulfill its obligations under the Convention.\n       (b) The advice and consent of the Senate under section 1 is \n     subject to the following declarations, which shall be \n     included in the United States instrument of ratification:\n       (1) In accordance with Article 66, paragraph 3, the United \n     States of America declares that it does not consider itself \n     bound by the obligation set forth in Article 66, paragraph 2.\n       (2) The United States declares that the provisions of the \n     Convention (with the exception of Articles 44 and 46) are \n     non-self-executing. None of the provisions of the Convention \n     creates a private right of action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/15/senate-section/article/S9663-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
