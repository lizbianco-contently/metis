Mr. President, the Senate returns to session today and \njoins the world in mourning the death of Pope John Paul II. I know many \nof my colleagues will want to pay tribute to one of our greatest \nspiritual leaders. Therefore, we will have a period of morning business \nthroughout the day to accommodate those speeches. I also alert my \ncolleagues that we are working on a Senate resolution which would pay \nthe appropriate respect and tribute to Pope John Paul.\n  We have also returned to the sad news of the passing of one of our \nformer colleagues, Senator Howell Heflin of Alabama. Our thoughts and \nprayers go out to his family.\n  With regard to the schedule this week, we have a busy legislative \nschedule with a number of scheduling challenges over the next several \ndays. We hope to begin consideration of the State Department \nauthorization bill tomorrow, on Tuesday. Chairman Lugar is preparing to \nbring that bill to the floor, and we hope to complete work on that over \nthe course of the next couple of days. I hope we can reach an agreement \nthat will allow that bill to come forward, with amendments relevant to \nthe underlying legislation.\n  In addition, on Wednesday, there will be a joint meeting of the House \nand Senate to receive an address by Ukrainian President Viktor \nYushchenko. That is scheduled for 11 a.m. We ask that Members be in the \nSenate Chamber at approximately 10:30 so we may proceed together to the \nHall of the House of Representatives for that address.\n  Also this week, we have a couple of district judges who are available \nfor consideration, and we will want to schedule those for floor action.\n  On behalf of the Republican and Democratic Policy Committees, I \nremind everybody that on Tuesday we will have a floor debate on the \nissue of Social Security. Senators Santorum, DeMint, Durbin, and \nStabenow will participate in the scheduled debate. I encourage all \nMembers to listen to this constructive conversation. I applaud\n\n[[Page S3114]]\n\nboth policy committees for preparing this format. I was pleased to work \nwith the Democratic leader in securing a time for this debate tomorrow. \nThis week, Senator Cochran will be marking up the supplemental \nappropriations bill. We hope to have that available next week.\n  Again, we have much on the plate for this week both in terms of floor \nschedule and other important Senate events. I look forward to a busy \nlegislative period this spring, and trust all of my colleagues are \nrested and ready to proceed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/04/senate-section/article/S3114-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it is my understanding that the \ndistinguished Republican leader is going to make a statement regarding \nthe Pope. I think that is timely. I will do so at a later time today.\n  I wanted to pay tribute to Howell Heflin. He was a wonderful man who \nserved in the Senate for 18 years. He actually revolutionized the court \nsystem in Alabama. The first amendment they ever had to their \nConstitution was a result of his reorganization of the court when he \nwas chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court.\n  Howell Heflin holds the record here, serving as a member of the \nEthics Committee for 13 years. He did that with dignity during some of \nthe most difficult times we have seen in the Senate with some of the \nproblems Senators had.\n  I had the good fortune of traveling to Alabama yesterday to be with \nhis widow Mike at that funeral in the rural community of Tuscumbia, AL. \nThat is where he had his home and law practice and where he died. He \nhad very little suffering. He was 83 years old. He got sick one \nafternoon and died within an hour or two after that.\n  The Senate will always be a better place as a result of Senator \nHeflin having been a Member. Death comes at inopportune times. I want \nhis widow to know that even though there were only a few Senators \nthere, including Senator Bingaman, and Senator Shelby, who had another \nfuneral he had to go to, Senator Sessions was there, it came at such an \ninopportune time. It was the end of the recess period. People didn't \nknow about it, and it was hard for people to be there, but it doesn't \ntake away from the dignity of that proceeding. It was a wonderful \nfuneral. I received a number of phone calls yesterday and today of \npeople wanting to be there. For example, the wind was so heavy \nyesterday that they had to change the place of takeoff from Andrews to \nDulles. As a result of that, Senator Biden, driving down from Delaware, \ncould not make it. He had to drive 35, 40 miles.\n  Again, we send our condolences to Tom, his son, and Mike, his widow. \nAs a Senate family, we felt so good about Senator Heflin in life and in \ndeath.\n\n\n                    Address of President Yushchenko\n\n  I also say this to the majority leader.\n  I had the good fortune during this break to lead a bipartisan CODEL. \nWe had the opportunity to sit down and talk to President Yushchenko. \nHere is a man they tried to kill. We think we know who tried to \nassassinate him. Here is a man whose face is a little disfigured, but \nhis spirit is not. He has the ability, I believe, to bring about a \nchange in that country that will be for generations to come. It is a \nburgeoning democracy. Things are on the move, and he has a dynamic \npersonality. I am glad he is going to be able to address a joint \nsession of Congress because he is what our country is all about. So I \ncommend and applaud the Speaker for arranging for this man, a good man, \nto speak before a joint session of Congress. It will make us all better \nfor having the ability and the opportunity to listen to him.\n  I apologize to the leader for taking more time than usual, but I will \nreturn at a later time and make some remarks about the Pope, who passed \naway.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/04/senate-section/article/S3114-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING POPE JOHN PAUL II\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today, this body, the Senate, and the world \ncommunity grieve for the passing of Pope John Paul II. He passed away \nSaturday evening, April 2, in his bed overlooking St. Peter's Square. \nMillions of Catholics and non-Catholics alike mourn the departure of \none of the greatest spiritual leaders and moral teachers of the modern \nera.\n  Pope John Paul set an extraordinary example of personal integrity and \ncourage, not only for his fellow Catholics but for people of every \nreligious and philosophical viewpoint.\n  Pope John Paul was born Karol Joseph Wojtyla on May 18, 1920, in \nPoland, a country which at the time was a desolate, impoverished, and \nwar-torn place. By the time John Paul reached the age of 21, every \nclose member of his family had died. Most people would have been \ndevastated by such losses. But for John Paul, this early experience of \nsuffering deepened his spirituality and his capacity to find meaning in \nman's frailty.\n  John Paul was ordained as a priest at the age of 26. In 1964, he \nbecame the Bishop of Krakow. Three years later, he was elevated to \ncardinal by Pope Paul VI. In 1978, he became the first non-Italian in \n455 years to be elected Pope of the Catholic Church.\n  For the next 2\\1/2\\ decades, Pope John Paul campaigned tirelessly for \nhuman rights and dignity throughout the world. He practiced and \ninspired resistance to the great totalitarian systems that rose and, \nwith his help, fell in the 20th century. He had the key insight that, \nin his words, ``the historical experience of socialist countries has \nsadly demonstrated that collectivism does not do away with alienation, \nbut rather increases it, adding to it a lack of basic necessities and \neconomic inefficiency.''\n\n  His historic trip to Poland in 1979 catalyzed the Solidarity movement \nand led to the peaceful dissolution of the Soviet empire.\n  John Paul fostered harmony between Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, and \nProtestant Christians. He reached out in friendship to Jews and members \nof other faiths, and he warmly promoted interfaith understanding.\n  He was the first Pope to visit a mosque and the first Pope to visit a \nsynagogue. A poet, a playwright, and a philosopher, Pope John Paul II \ndedicated himself to the defense of the weakest and most vulnerable \nmembers of the human family.\n  He eloquently defended the right to life of every human being, \nirrespective of race or sex, age or size, stage of development, or \ncondition of dependence. He believed that ``science can purify religion \nfrom error and superstition. Religion can purify science from idolatry \nand false absolutes.''\n  On his visits to the United States, he called on all Americans to be \nfaithful to the great principles of liberty included in our Declaration \nof Independence and in the Constitution. Even in his last frail \nmoments, he remained devoted to God and the cause of justice. His \nselfless service to God and man will remain an inspiration to all \npeople of good will across the globe.\n  I will close with a poem he wrote for his mother at the age of 19. It \nreflects his extraordinarily sensitive nature and closes with a prayer \nthe world now sends out to him. It is entitled ``Over This, Your White \nGrave'':\n\n     Over this, your white grave,\n     The flowers of life in white,\n     So many years without you,\n     How many have passed out of sight?\n     Over this, your white grave,\n     Covered for years, there is a stir\n     In the air, something uplifting\n     And, like death, beyond comprehension.\n     Over this, your white grave,\n     Oh, Mother, can such loving cease?\n     For all his filial adoration\n     A prayer:\n     Give her eternal peace.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/04/senate-section/article/S3114-4", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as I have done many times before on this \nfloor, I rise to address a national security issue of the highest \nimportance, one that demands our utmost attention. I wish to alert this \nbody and the American people to China's spreading global influence and \nthe imminent threat this poses to our national security.\n  Our past concerns have come to fruition on all levels--economically, \nmilitarily, and ideologically. We are on a collision course. As I will \ndetail, China has become a progressive danger we can no longer afford \nto overlook. As I said, this is not new. Over the years I have made \nnumerous remarks on the Senate floor regarding our national security \nand China.\n  During the Clinton administration, there were growing concerns about \nChinese espionage, which were later confirmed in the Cox report. The \nreport showed that reality surpassed our worst fears. China had been \nstealing U.S. nuclear secrets. The W-88 warhead, with which we are all \nfamiliar, was the crown jewel of our nuclear program which allowed for \nup to 10 nuclear warheads to be attached to the same missile. In 1995, \nwe discovered that China had stolen this technology.\n  Under President Clinton, U.S. companies such as Loral Space and \nCommunications and Hughes Electronics were given the green light to \nimprove the precision and reliability of China's satellites and their \nnuclear missiles, undoing 50 years of technology export restrictions. \nChina also gained the capability of accurately reaching the continental \nUnited States with nuclear missiles and targeted between 13 and 18 U.S. \ncities. All of this occurred while President Clinton proclaimed ``not \none missile is pointed at American children.'' This body responded by \ninvestigating to what extent we were lied to and our security was \ncompromised, but ultimately nothing changed.\n\n  From those events, the Chinese Government learned that it could rely \non our acquiescence and charged ahead. China transferred prohibited \nweapons technology to North Korea, Pakistan, Libya, Iraq, Iran, Syria, \nand other countries. China threatened to absorb Taiwan and intimidated \nour regional treaty allies, South Korea and Japan.\n  That was 5 years ago. Since then we have had a new administration and \nhave gone through such major events as 9/11, the current conflict in \nIraq, and an ideological shift in the way we fight war. I wish I could \nsay that with the new administration China's conduct has changed. \nPresident Bush has taken some steps in the right direction, notably \nrejuvenating the missile defense system; however, I am afraid that \ntranspiring events tell a different story.\n  Since 2000, the United States-China Security Economic Review \nCommission has been holding hearings and issuing annual reports to \nevaluate ``the national security implications of the bilateral trade \nand economic relationship between the United States and the People's \nRepublic of China.'' Congress established the Commission to act as the \nbipartisan authority on how our relationship with China affects our \neconomy, industrial base, China's military and weapons proliferation, \nand our influence in Asia. I fear their reports have gone largely \nunnoticed. It is remarkable they have gone unnoticed as significant as \nthey were.\n  In a most recent report, dated June of 2004, less than a year ago, \nthe Commission makes this alarming opening statement. This is a \nbipartisan report:\n\n       Based on our analyses to date, as documented in detail in \n     our report, the Commission believes that a number of the \n     current trends in U.S.-China relations have negative \n     implications for our long-term economic and national security \n     interests and therefore that U.S. policies in these areas are \n     in need of urgent attention and course corrections.\n\n  As the report and recent events show, China has continued on an \nalarming course in conflict with our national security.\n  Last January, the Bush administration imposed sanctions against eight \nlarge Chinese companies for aiding Iraq's missile program and \ntransferring technology to other problematic countries. There was no \npublic announcement, and the only reason we know about this is that \nsome Sino-American Web sites came across this information on page 133 \nin the Federal Register. Last December, four companies were sanctioned \nfor the same reason. Many other examples can be cited from 2004, with \nsome of these companies being repeatedly penalized for more than a \ndecade. The fact is that China has repeatedly vowed to curb its weapons \nsales and has gone back on its promises. This has been going on for \nsome time. I spoke of this on the Senate floor on June 23, 1999.\n  Beijing made nonproliferation commitments in 1992, 1994, 1998, 2000, \nand most recently in 2002. The U.S. State Department admits these \nguarantees came about ``only under the imminent threat, or in response \nto the actual imposition, of sanctions.''\n  The Commission report comments on China's continued assistance to \ncountries such as Libya, Pakistan, Iran, and North Korea. This \nassistance has continued despite nonproliferation assurances as the \nreport outlines. Keep in mind, they have agreed to all these \nagreements, and yet the report says:\n\n       China's assistance to weapons of mass destruction-related \n     programs in countries of concern continues despite repeated \n     promises to end such activities and the repeated imposition \n     of U.S. sanctions. The Chinese Government and Chinese \n     enterprises have assisted such states to develop their \n     nuclear infrastructure, chemical weapons capabilities, and/or \n     ballistic missile systems notwithstanding a consistent \n     history of denials. Libya's decision to open up its weapons \n     of mass destruction programs and the revelations by Pakistan \n     that A.Q. Khan supplied uranium enrichment technology to \n     Libya, Iran, and North Korea, provides new insight into \n     China's legacy of proliferation. China's continued failure to \n     adequately curb its proliferation practices poses significant \n     national security concerns to the United States.\n\n  Again, this is not new. As I stated on the floor on March 15, 1999, \nChina has been stealing our nuclear secrets, but, as the Commission \npoints out, China is now sharing its nuclear knowledge--some of it is \nquite possibly ours--with other countries. For years China has \ntransferred ballistic and cruise missile technology to countries with \ntroubling proliferation records, but these transfers have evolved to \nbecome even more problematic.\n  Again I quote from the bipartisan Commission that spent 4 years \nstudying this relationship:\n\n     . . . Chinese transfers have evolved from sales of complete \n     missile systems, to exports of largely-dual use nuclear, \n     chemical, and missile components and technologies . . . \n     Recent activities ``have aggravated trends that result in \n     ambiguous technical aid, more indigenous capabilities, longer \n     range missiles, and secondary proliferation.'' Continuing \n     intelligence reports indicate that the Chinese cooperation \n     with Pakistan and Iran remains an integral element of China's \n     foreign policy . . . Beijing's failure to control such \n     transfers gives the appearance that these are allowed in \n     accordance with an unstated national policy. China has \n     generally tried to avoid making fundamental changes in its \n     transfer policies by offering the United States carefully \n     worded commitments or exploiting differences between \n     agreements.\n\n  As further evidence of this disturbing proliferation, the CIA report \nto Congress in mid-2003 said that ``firms in China provided dual-use \nmissile-related items, raw materials, and/or assistance to . . . \ncountries of proliferation concern such as Iran, Libya, and North \nKorea.''\n  Virtually every country we worry about possesses or has access to \nsome form of chemical, biological, or nuclear weapon, but most lack \neffective delivery systems. China is a proven violator of \nnonproliferation treaties that keep such countries from gaining access \nto delivery system technology. According to State Department testimony, \nChina has a ``serial proliferation problem,'' and while the official \nline is to crack down on weapons trade, ``reality has been quite \ndifferent.'' In her January Senate confirmation hearings, Secretary of \nState Condoleezza Rice listed six countries as ``outposts of tyranny.'' \nChina has strong ties to four of these. They are Cuba, Burma, North \nKorea, and Iran.\n\n[[Page S3116]]\n\n  Recently, Iran has been in the headlines because of its support for \nterrorism, threatening posture, and nuclear program. China supplying \nthem with weapons technology is similar to the role the Soviet Union \nplayed in the Cuban missile crisis. It is probably worse because at \nleast in Cuba, the U.S.S.R. maintained control of the weapons and \ntechnology. On the other hand, China is fully willing to proliferate \nregardless of the consequences. Some say the real issue is with private \ncompanies and Beijing does not have knowledge of what is going on.\n  With the delicate situation in North Korea, the Bush administration \nis holding that line. But the fact remains that at the very least, the \nChinese Government is negligent in deterring such proliferation and \napparently does not feel any pressure to do so. However, as some of \nthese companies are closely linked with the Chinese military, it is \nclear that the government is not so ignorant as we may like to imagine.\n  This continued proliferation in the face of intense pressure to stop \nmakes me ask the question: What is China getting in return? China seems \nto proliferate with countries that have been terrorist sponsors, such \nas Iran, Iraq, and Libya. These countries offer China something they \ndesperately need, and that is oil. That is what is significant.\n  Energy is a major problem facing China, which ranks No. 2 in the \nworld for consumption. This is very interesting because right now we \nhave been talking about the fact we have a very serious problem in not \nhaving an energy policy, not being able to pass an energy bill--it has \nbeen killed by people who think we do not need to run this great \nmachine called America.\n  Since my floor speeches in 1999, China's oil imports have doubled and \nsurged upwards of 57 percent in the last year alone. I have a chart \nthat shows what could very well happen in the future. This chart starts \nin 1990 and goes to 2025 and shows what China's projected oil \nproduction versus consumption is. The red line is consumption. The \ngreen line is production. We can see they do not have production. They \nhave to get production from someplace. That is something to which we \nshould be most sensitive. China's oil production is topped out while \nits demand continues to rise at an alarming pace. Some analysts project \nChina's oil needs will double again by 2010, and it will use its \nreserves within 14 years. This information is from International Energy \nOutlook of 2004. We believe this to be accurate.\n  China's alarming need for oil has caused it to look around to the \nworld for new sources, sources that are often problematic states with \nsecurity concerns to the United States. The Commission makes an \nunpopular but straightforward observation. I am going to quote this \nvery significant statement out of the Commission report:\n\n       This need for energy security may help explain Beijing's \n     history of assistance to terrorist-sponsoring states with \n     various forms of weapons of mass destruction-related items \n     and technical assistance, even in the face of U.S. sanctions. \n     But this pursuit of oil diplomacy may support objectives \n     beyond just energy supply. Beijing's bilateral arrangements \n     with oil-rich Middle Eastern states also helped create \n     diplomatic and strategic alliances with countries that were \n     hostile to the United States. For example, with U.S. \n     interests precluded from entering Iran, China may hope to \n     achieve a long-term competitive advantage relative to the \n     United States.\n       Over time, Beijing's relationship-building may counter U.S. \n     power and enhance Beijing's ability to influence political \n     and military outcomes. One of Beijing's stated goals is to \n     reduce what it considers U.S. superpower dominance in favor \n     of a multipolar global power structure in which China attains \n     superpower status on par with the United States.\n\n  In Venezuela, anti-American President Hugo Chavez announced a $3 \nbillion trade strategy with China, including provision for oil and gas. \nArmy GEN Bantz Craddock, who heads the United States Southern Command, \nstated that China is increasing its influence in South America, filling \na vacuum left by the United States.\n  In his March 9 House testimony, General Craddock called China's \nprogressive interest in the region ``an emerging dynamic that could not \nbe ignored.''\n  I have been traveling to Africa for many years. The Chinese are \neverywhere. I just got back last night from Africa. I saw a conference \nbuilding being constructed, given to them free, from China, and we know \nwhat kind of relationship that gives them. I saw a conference center \nbeing constructed in the Congo. I saw a large sports stadium. Both were \ndonated by the Chinese. China has been expanding its influence \nthroughout Africa with projects like this.\n  One saying I heard was: The U.S. tells you what you need, but China \ngives you what you want.\n  Has China suddenly become compassionate and generous? I think the \nfact that these countries have large oil and mineral deposits paints a \nreal picture.\n  In the Middle East, Beijing recently signed a $70 billion oil and gas \ndeal with Iran from which it receives 14 percent of its oil imports. \nNaturally, China has come out firmly against the U.N. Security Council \nholding Iran economically accountable for its nuclear program.\n  I was just in Sudan 2 days ago. Likewise in Sudan, China seeks to \ndiffuse or delay any U.N. sanctions against Khartoum. It hardly seems \ncoincidental that 7 percent of its oil imports comes from that \nconflict-stricken country, a supply that China seems ready to protect.\n  At this point, I will pause and tell my colleagues the experience we \nhad just 2 days ago in that area in Uganda, just across the Sudan \nborder. We were working with President Museveni. We actually went up to \nthe area called Gulu, which is right on the Sudan border where the \nterrorists are coming across maiming children, cutting their limbs and \ntheir lips off. It is horrible. It is beyond description. I do not \nthink there has been anything like that since the Holocaust. Yet China \nis supporting that group.\n  Not only are they willing to use the U.N. to safeguard its energy \nsources but also its regional influence. This is not new. In 2003, the \nUnited States spearheaded the proliferation security initiative as a \nmultilateral weapons of mass destruction interdiction strategy. The \ninitiative has proven effective, particularly in the interception of \ncentrifuge parts bound for Libya. The Bush administration believes this \nsuccess was a major reason Libya peacefully ended its nuclear program.\n  Major European and Asian countries have joined and China was invited \nto participate and refused, citing dubious concerns about the delicate \nsituation in North Korea. To quote the Commission:\n\n       China appears to be working through the United Nations to \n     not only undermine the initiative but also to render it \n     globally ineffective. This has been accomplished by getting \n     the United States to drop a provision on the interdiction of \n     foreign vessels carrying banned weapons on the high seas.\n\n  I think it is worth repeating what the Commission statement said:\n\n       One of Beijing's stated goals is to reduce what it \n     considers U.S. superpower dominance in favor of multipolar \n     global power structure in which China attains superpower \n     status on par with the United States.\n\n  The tense situation in Taiwan continues to simmer. A few days ago, \nthe Chinese Communist Party formalized a new stance on Taiwan. The \nfollowing was approved by the National People's Congress:\n\n       If possibilities for a peaceful reunification should be \n     completely exhausted, the state shall employ nonpeaceful \n     means and other necessary measures to protect China's \n     sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\n  This represents a change from earlier ambiguous language that would \nhave allowed China flexibility to consider other options should a \nconflict arise. As it is, China has taken away its alternatives.\n  This is a direct threat. The Chinese are solidifying and increasing \ntheir presence in east Asia. When not using overt political influence, \nthey are expanding economically.\n  As political economist Francis Fukuyama observed:\n\n       The Chinese [have been] gearing up a series of multilateral \n     initiatives of their own, including Asean Plus One, Asean \n     Plus Three, a China-Asean Free Trade Area, a Northeast Asian \n     Free Trade Area and so on in seemingly endless profusion.\n       The purpose of these proposals, it seems fairly clear in \n     retrospect, was to allay fears of China's growing economic \n     power by offering selective trade concessions to various \n     Chinese neighbors. The Chinese greased the path to the East \n     Asian Summit last December by offering its Asean neighbors a \n     free trade agreement that would open access to much of the \n     Chinese market by 2010.\n       Asean Plus Three appears to be a weak and innocuous \n     organization. But the Chinese\n\n[[Page S3117]]\n\n     know what they are doing: Over the long run, they want to \n     organize East Asia in a way that puts them in the center of \n     regional politics.\n\n  China is also expanding militarily. Their string of pearls strategy \nincludes a listening post in Pakistan, billions of dollars in military \naid to Burma, military training and equipment to Cambodia, increased \nnaval activities in the South China Sea, and expanding cooperation with \nThailand and Bangladesh.\n  The purpose of this strategy is to create a military corridor for the \nMiddle East to mainland China that would be impervious to any potential \nAmerican oil embargo. As a recent internal Pentagon report outlines:\n\n       China . . . is not looking only to build a blue-water navy \n     to control the sea lanes, but also to develop undersea mines \n     and missile capabilities to deter the potential disruption of \n     its energy supplies from potential threats, including the \n     U.S. Navy, especially in the case of a conflict with Taiwan.\n\n  The weapons in which China is investing include cruise missiles, \nsubmarines, long-range target acquisition systems, specifically cutting \nedge satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles, and the advanced SU-30 \nfighter aircraft, and I have to pause at this moment and say something \nabout someone to this day I still think is a real American hero, GEN \nJohn Jumper, the Chief of the Air Force. Back before he was in that \nposition in the late 1990s--I believe it was 1998--he had the courage \nto stand up and publicly say something, and it certainly was not \nendorsed or wanted by the Clinton administration, but he said we have \nto do something. We have stopped our modernization program so now \nRussia is selling tactical vehicles, air vehicles, that are better than \nour fighters. He is talking about the SU-30 series, better than our F-\n15s and F-16s.\n\n  There are a lot of people who do not want us to advance militarily \nand be No. 1 and give our troops and our airmen the very best \nequipment. There are people who are trying to keep us from developing \nthe F-22 and the joint strike fighter so that we again will gain \nsuperiority. Right now we do not have it.\n  China has bought in one purchase, and this has been several years \nago, 240 of the SU-30s and probably a lot more, but that is what we \nfound out. The new intelligence report states that China has \naccelerated its amphibious assault ship production. It plans to build \n23 new boats capable of ferrying tanks and troops across the Taiwan \nStrait. This development is potentially destabilizing and has alarming \nimplications.\n  We have to keep in mind they now are buying this capability to get \nacross to Taiwan after for the first time coming out and directly \nthreatening Taiwan.\n  A further concern is China's investment in nuclear submarines. It \nrecently launched the type 094 class, the first capable of striking the \ncontinental United States with nuclear missiles from its own waters. It \ncan strike the United States of America from its own waters. They have \nlaunched this class of a nuclear missile--or the ability to deploy it.\n  China has also been developing the JL-2 submarine-launched ballistic \nmissile, expected to have a range of 4,600 miles. These represent a \ndeparture from traditional Chinese deterrent strategies. They have \nlittle tactical purposes. They will not be used in a regional battle. \nRather, their importance is strategic.\n  China has modernized its military at an unprecedented rate. According \nto testimony from Dr. Evan Medeiros of the RAND Corporation, between \n1990 and 2002 China's official defense budget for weapons procurement \ngrew approximately 1,000 percent. That is 1,000 percent in a 12-year \nperiod. Nearly every year since 1997 has seen a defense budget increase \nof 13 percent, an increase far above China's GDP growth average of 8.2 \npercent for those same years.\n  In comparison, President Bush's fiscal year 2005 budget increase in \ndefense spending is 4.8 percent. Keep in mind, we are currently engaged \nin two major operations and numerous smaller ones as part of the global \nwar on terror. Yet this is just China's officially announced defense \nbudget.\n  The Commission and the Defense Department assess:\n\n       The PLA defense budget is grossly underreported and that \n     official figures exclude much of China's military \n     modernization program.\n\n  So when we are talking about what China is putting into their \nmilitary program, we recognize that this may be 50 percent of what they \nare really putting in it because we have no way of knowing.\n  Our intelligence does show in an unclassified form that they are \ndoing a lot more than the reports they send out. The Commission \nestimates the actual defense budget is two to three times the stated \namount.\n  In the midst of this ominous military expansion, the European Union \nis planning on lifting its arms embargo against China. The embargo was \nput in place after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre to reflect \nChina's appalling human rights record. The European Union claims the \nembargo is no longer effective but ignores the obvious. Why lift the \nembargo without replacing it with a better one?\n  Their solution, an informal code of conduct, allows for no \ncomprehensive enforcement. Without uniform and enforceable standards, \ncompetent European firms will be left to themselves to determine \nacceptable arms sales. Even with the embargo, Europe's sales to China \nrecently doubled this past year to a half billion dollars.\n  Underneath all of the semantics, the EU appears to have more to gain \nin Euros than by maintaining what principled respect for human rights \nit once had. Any weapons technology China buys will only add to its \nleverage against Taiwan and our other Asian allies. If the embargo is \nlifted, Europe and Russia will be in competition to sell China \nincreasingly higher technologies. We can also expect the EU technology \nto proliferate beyond China's borders to states that would gladly use \nit against the United States. The EU does not consider this a strategic \nthreat.\n  The United States-China Commission report observes, however:\n\n       Access to more advanced systems and integrating \n     technologies from Europe would have a much more dramatic \n     impact on overall Chinese capabilities today than say five or \n     ten years ago. For fourteen years China has been unable to \n     acquire systems from the West. Analysts believe a resumption \n     of EU arms sales to China would dramatically enhance China's \n     military capability. If the EU arms embargo against China is \n     lifted, the U.S. military could be placed in a situation \n     where it is defending itself against arms sold to the PLA by \n     NATO allies.\n\n  With all the other problems that we have had recently with some of \nour multinational groups, this is really not surprising.\n  Imagine, we share military technology with our European allies and \nthen find our security threatened and possibly our servicemen killed by \nthis same technology. We cannot allow for this potential to exist.\n\n  Because of China's centralized economy, economic issues are \nirrevocably intertwined with security implications. The Commission \nreports:\n\n       The Chinese government has selectively chosen firms--\n     predominantly State-owned enterprises, SOEs--to list on \n     international capital markets . . . Many SOEs were previously \n     controlled by the People's Liberation Army, PLA, and there is \n     concern that unofficial links to the PLA remain intact after \n     privatization . . . As of 2002, more than three-quarters of \n     companies listed as A shares in China's capital market are \n     State-controlled. These include known proliferators such as \n     NORINCO, which was sanctioned by the U.S. Government on four \n     separate occasions in 2003 for offenses including missile \n     proliferation and sales of equipment or expertise to Iran \n     that could be used in a WMD or cruise or ballistic missile \n     program.\n\n  Chinese firms lack adequate disclosure; as the case of NORINCO \ndemonstrates, American investors may unwittingly be supporting \ncompanies that oppose our national security.\n  One company, China National Nuclear Corporation--CNNC--is currently \nslotted to receive $5 billion from the U.S. Export Import Bank to build \nnuclear power plants in China. However, there are two problems: first, \nthis company was discovered to be sending Pakistan prohibited materials \nthat weaponize uranium. Sanctions were imposed for 1 month and removed. \nLater that same year, a subsidiary of CNNC was discovered to be selling \nmore illegal materials to Pakistan. Connections have also been made to \nIran's weapon program. Second, because the Export-Import Bank of the \nUnited States supplies the credit, the U.S. Treasury will have to back \nthis loan, either by direct payment or guarantee. Ultimately, American \ntaxpayers\n\n[[Page S3118]]\n\nwill be aiding a Chinese company that is a known proliferator. I look \nat these things and ask why doesn't that bother anybody? Nobody is \ntalking about it.\n  Another issue is China's purchasing of U.S. companies. On March 9, \nthe Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States--CFIUS--\napproved China's Lenovo Group buying IBM's PC business. The $1.75 \nbillion deal creates the third largest PC maker in the world. The \nproblem is that there is potential for Chinese computer experts to use \nthis as a base for espionage. Some say that this is ridiculous; that \nChina could never use IBM networks that way. I would ask that they \nconsider not only the immediate situation but also China's track \nrecord. As a side note, I believe that CFIUS does not apply a broad \nenough conception of U.S. security. I understand that Representatives \nHyde, Hunter and Manzullo expressed similar views in a January letter \nto Treasury Secretary John Snow, the chairman of CFIUS.\n  One example of CFIUS falling short is with Magnequench International \nIncorporated. In 1995, Chinese corporations bought GM's Magnequench, a \nsupplier of rare earth metals used in the guidance systems of smart-\nbombs. For over 12 years, the company has been moved piecemeal to \nmainland China, leaving the U.S. with no domestic supplier of \nneodymium, a critical component of rare-earth magnets. CFIUS approved \nthis transfer. The problem takes a unique twist, as Nathan Tabor of The \nConservative Voice outlines:\n\n       China [has] become the dominant supplier of rare-earth \n     elements, also called lanthanides. But in the U.S., owners of \n     the Mountain Pass mine in California, one of the finest rare-\n     earth deposits in the world, have been spending millions of \n     dollars over many years to resolve an environmental complaint \n     that processing the element threatens the habitat of the \n     desert tortoise.\n\n  This is something that has restricted some of our activities.\n  Dependence on outsourcing has the potential to be a paralyzing \nproblem in time of war. During the current Iraq conflict, Switzerland \nstopped shipments of smart-bomb components to the U.S. because it \ndisagreed with our role. As more and more of our military equipment is \noutsourced, we have become dangerously dependent on the whims of \nforeign countries. Current law requires only 50 percent of defense \nequipment be American-made. When Representative Duncan Hunter tried to \nraise this to 65 percent, defense contractors told him that it would \nforce them out of the market.\n  Information technology is also leaving our borders at an alarming \nrate. John Chambers, the CEO of CISCO Systems, said:\n\n       China will become the IT center of the world, and we can \n     have a healthy discussion about whether that's in 2020 or \n     2040. What we're trying to do is outline an entire strategy \n     of becoming a Chinese company.\n\n  However, this technology transfer can also have a darker side. The \nCommission report states:\n\n       U.S. advanced technology and technological expertise is \n     transferred to China in a number of ways, both legal and \n     illegal, including through U.S. invested firms and research \n     centers in China, Chinese investments in the United States, \n     bilateral science and technology cooperative programs, and \n     Chinese students and researchers who return home following \n     their work and study at U.S. universities and research \n     institutes.\n\n  In a previous speech that I gave on China, on June 23, 1999, I called \nattention to China's covert stealing of our technology. The FBI is \ncurrently investigating numerous instances of alleged industrial \nespionage; over 3,000 companies in the U.S. are suspected of supplying \nillegal technology and collecting information for China. Such cases are \nmajor problems in industrial centers like Silicon Valley where \nespionage investigations linked with China have increased 20 to 30 \npercent annually.\n  Most recently, the Bush administration is investigating whether China \nhas illegally altered legitimate U.S. exports for military use. One \ninstance of this is U.S.-made Boeing 737 jetliner being modified to \nhave military capabilities. Experts believe that China is using the \naircraft to monitor tests of its long-range cruise missile similar to \nour Navy Tomahawk. Such a missile would be capable of delivering long-\nrange conventional or nuclear payloads.\n\n  Whether it is military or economic expansionism, human rights, \nillegal proliferation or outright stealing of military technology, \nChina has continued to defy the U.S. and the world unabated and \nunchallenged.\n  Let me repeat what concerns me, and apparently the U.S.-China \nCommission, about China:\n  No. 1, eight major Chinese companies, some of which are directly \nconnected with the military, were sanctioned last January for illegally \nselling weapons technology to countries including Iran. This is only \none example of an ongoing and grave strategic problem. It is a problem \nwe cannot afford to tolerate.\n  No. 2, China has been modernizing and expanding its military to \nreduce any leverage we may have in a conflict situation, particularly \nover Taiwan. They have been stealing or developing highly advanced \ntechnology, including nuclear warhead designs and technology that would \nenable them to reach the continental U.S.\n  No. 3, skyrocketing energy consumption is a major problem for China \nand a potential conflict with us. It is drawing the PRC into \ncooperation with Iran and other problematic states. These bilateral \narrangements improperly influence Chinese action the U.N., and in some \ncases may involve illegal weapons transfers. You can see from this \nchart behind me that China has to do something. Look at their energy \nrequirements. They are doing it today.\n  No. 4, the European Union is projected to lift its arms embargo on \nChina by this summer, an embargo that was meant to pressure China to \nimprove its human rights record. That record has not improved. Europe \nhas also failed to address the question: What country will China most \nlikely use the new European technology against? It is ultimately the \nUnited States.\n  No. 5, despite Justice Department and Homeland Security concerns, \nChina's Lenovo Group is taking over IBM's PC manufacturing business, \nbased in North Carolina. This is revealing of a distressing trend that \nthreatens the U.S. industrial base. Our practice of outsourcing \nmilitary equipment is also of deep concern.\n  No. 6, China continues to repress religious and human rights, and \nintimidate our Asian allies while expanding their influence in areas \nlike South America and Africa. The recent Taiwanese ``anti-secession'' \nbill is further evidence of this hegemonic outlook.\n  No. 7, according to the FBI, cases of Chinese espionage in the States \nare increasing at 30 percent annually in some places. Civil aircraft \nthat the U.S. sold to China appear to be outfitted with military \nsurveillance equipment. Revelation of such activities garners few \nheadlines because this behavior is nothing new. They have been doing it \nfor a long time and no one seems to care.\n  Indeed, we are used to this pattern and have become all too \ncomplacent about it. Scolding the Chinese for their disregard for \nproliferation treaties, while providing them unprecedented economic \nbenefits is at best a bizarre foreign policy. We must link China's \ntrading privileges with its human rights record and its conduct abroad, \nincluding its weapons proliferation. As China's No. 1 importing \ncustomer, accounting for 35 percent of total Chinese exports, we have \nthe influence. I agree that the way we handle an emerging China must be \ndynamic, but it must not be weak. As the Commission report concludes:\n\n       We need to use our substantial leverage to develop an \n     architecture that will help avoid conflict, attempt to build \n     cooperative practices and institutions, and advance both \n     countries' long-term interests. The United States has the \n     leverage now and perhaps for the next decade, but this may \n     not always be the case. We also must recognize the impact of \n     these trends directly on the domestic U.S. economy, and \n     develop and adopt policies that ensure that our actions do \n     not undermine our economic interests . . . the United States \n     cannot lose sight of these important goals, and must \n     configure its policies toward China to help make the \n     materialize . . . If we falter in the use of our economic and \n     political influence now to effect positive change in China, \n     we will have squandered an historic opportunity . . . China \n     will likely not initiate the decisive measures toward more \n     meaningful economic and political reform without substantial, \n     sustained, and increased pressure from the United States.\n\n  There is an inherent tension between drawing China to freedom through \nrelaxed policies, and a vital need to protect U.S. security. I fear we \nhave conceded far too much and contributed to the emergence of a very \nreal threat.\n\n[[Page S3119]]\n\n  Finally, I wish to applaud the U.S.-China Economic and Security \nReview Commission. Their efforts to provide this body with a clear \npicture of a very complex and multifaceted situation have been \nilluminating and challenge us to face these real problems. Thank you \nfor your hard work.\n  The Chinese have something called an idiom, a four-character phrase \nthat is sometimes used to simplify a complex thought. I would borrow \none to describe the current situation: ``One who obeys on the surface \nbut not from one's heart.'' Unless our relationship with China is \nbacked up with strong action they will never take us seriously. We will \ncertainly see more violations of proliferation treaties and in the \ncontext of the growing threat of terrorism. That is unacceptable. We \nhave also ignored the danger that China is becoming in its own right. \nSome think that I am alarmist. If China breaks its consistent pattern \nof human rights abuses, military and economic expansionism, and illegal \nweapons proliferation, I am prepared to concede my concerns are \nunfounded. But I fear that the next few years will continue to confirm \nan obvious trend. The time to act is now, before the problem is beyond \nthe realm of policy. We urgently need a coherent strategy for dealing \nwith China, one that allows room for China's changing role without \nsacrificing our national security and other interests.\n  As I have demonstrated, we are on a collision course with China on \nall levels: economically, militarily, and ideologically. The situation \nhas only worsened since my previous floor speeches about China in 1999. \nWe are two trains accelerating in different directions on the same \ntrack. After the last decade I think we have seen that appeasement \ndoesn't work; it's time to deal in a very real way with our unpaid \nbills.\n  I often think about the appeasement policies we sometimes have \nagainst these countries.\n  I think it was Horace Mann who said:\n\n       No man survives when freedom fails. The best men rot in \n     filthy jails. Those who cried ``appease, appease'' are hanged \n     by those they try to please.\n\n  I am afraid that pretty well describes our relationship with China.\n  I hope this debate will awaken the American people to the real threat \nChina poses. To that end, I intend to deliver several more talks \nhighlighting the United States-China Commission's report and will \nintroduce a resolution to formally adopt the Commission's \nrecommendation.\n  I remember so well back when I was critical of the Clinton \nadministration in the very opening months of that administration in the \nearly 1990s when one of the first things they did at our energy \nlaboratories was to intentionally lower our security policy. They did \naway with background checks. They did away with the color-coded \nsecurity badges to demonstrate on site what level of security an \nindividual could have. They did away with some of the FBI checks. I was \nvery disturbed. That was over 10 years ago. We knew this was coming, \nand now it is here. It is time for us to take a different policy to \nChina.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to \nspeak for up to 30 minutes after the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand we are in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct. The Senator \nshould also be reminded he currently has a 10-minute time limit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/04/senate-section/article/S3119-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3119-S3120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING POPE JOHN PAUL II\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, late last week, the Nation witnessed the \nend to a saga that was heartrending not only for the medical \ncircumstances of the young woman at its center, but for the tragic \ncontroversy that surrounded it.\n  The Congress has spoken once about Terri Schiavo, and in the near \nfuture the Senate's Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nis expected to hold hearings about one of the issues Ms. Schiavo's \nsituation brought to the spotlight: the rights of the incapacitated and \nour society's responsibility toward that community. I hope the Congress \nwill now begin a thoughtful examination of this and issues relating to \nend-of-life care. For that reason, I rise today to urge and encourage \ncaution as the Senate moves forward.\n  George Washington called the Senate the saucer to cool the \nlegislation. I would say the Senate, in fact, must cool its own \npassions before proceeding. The alternative is unacceptable. The Senate \nmust not revisit the dangerous zero-sum game of 2 weeks ago, creating a \nfalse debate between those who seek protection and those who desire \nchoices and actually sacrificing one of those rights to secure the \nother. This body's responsibility is to find solutions that preserve \nboth. Protecting the vulnerable and preserving end-of-life choices are \nnot mutually exclusive. Advocates for the disabled are right when they \nsay that losing physical or mental capacity must not deprive anyone of \ntheir rights even if they have not had or taken the opportunity to make \ntheir treatment and wishes known.\n  There is legitimate cause for worry that the majority of our \npopulation might give short shrift to the real rights of a minority \ngroup. Journalist James Taranto summed it up well when he said:\n\n       It was natural for an able-bodied person to think: I \n     wouldn't want to live like [Terri Schiavo]. But someone who \n     is disabled and abjectly dependent on others was more apt to \n     be chilled by the talk of her ``poor quality of life'' and to \n     think: I wouldn't want to be killed like that.\n\n  Let us reject any legislative effort that springs from these false \nchoices diminishing the rights of the incapacitated and all Americans. \nNew Federal efforts may have the goal of protecting rights, but they \nmay have the real effect of engineering outcomes with little regard to \na patient's true interests. Instead of courting this risk, the Senate \nshould seek to empower the disabled and all Americans.\n  My sense is that momentum still exists in this body to act unwisely \nin a way that will produce more government and fewer choices for all \nAmericans at the end of life, so let me be clear. I intend to oppose \nany congressional fiat that disempowers our citizens--disabled, abled, \nincapacitated, or otherwise. I will oppose any such dictate that \nrestricts the choices for our citizens at the end of life and grows the \nrole of government instead.\n  In the last 2 weeks, Americans have overwhelmingly cautioned the \nCongress against government mandates for the end of life. Many voices \nare speaking. Some have been shouting. If the Senate can't yet \ndistinguish the country's clearly stated desire, then this body ought \nto fall silent and listen harder before acting.\n  In many ways, this is the central question of our time: whether the \nFederal Government will seek to expand its reach when the citizens wish \nfor more individual empowerment. Presented with that question 2 weeks \nago, the Senate got it wrong. The American people have made it clear \nthat moving forward, there ought to be a course correction. True \nleaders will approach these choices dispassionately with a set of \nimpartial principles.\n  I will spend a few minutes discussing what I think those principles \nought to be. First, the Senate should help empower Americans to make \ntheir own choices about the end of life, whatever those choices should \nbe. Policy ought to be grounded on the principle that Americans setting \ntheir dining room tables, in their kitchens, discussing their wishes \nand their fears with their loved ones, and asking in the end that \ngovernment should make sure their desires are carried out. The choices \nthey have to discuss--discuss in their homes and in their workplaces--\nought to be expanded, not weakened, by Government and bureaucracy. Our \npolicies should help their wishes to be honored by their families and \ntheir health care system--their lives sustained as they wish or \nunwanted treatment ended as they wish.\n\n  Second, as the Senate looks at the end of life, the Senate needs to \nlook at the entire picture. End-of-life care is more than respirators \nand feeding tubes and even more than living wills. The Senate has to \nget beyond today's hot-button questions. The Senate ought to look at \nthe fundamentals: conquering pain, expanding hospice care, capping the \ngreat potential of comfort care, which is known as palliative care. \nSupporting new ways to treat a very ill patient physically, \nspiritually, and emotionally, long before the last days of life, is a \ngood use of the Senate's time.\n  Third, the Senate must address end-of-life issues with respect for \nconstitutional boundaries that have been dangerously dismissed to date. \nFor the last 2 weeks, issues of separation of powers and federalism \nhave received virtually no attention. The Senate needs to reflect on \nthe roots and the reason of federalism, which has given the States \ncontrol over medical practice for more than 200 years. There is a line \nthe Senate must not cross again. Beyond that line are the \nconstitutional rights of States and, ultimately, the rights of our \ncitizens.\n  Those individual rights, or citizens rights, ought to be the Senate's \nfirst guideline in moving forward. I realize the temptation is to frame \nthe debate entirely in terms of the heartbreaking situation of Ms. \nSchiavo. I believe it would be a mistake, however, to base Federal law \non the basis of the tragic chaos that transpired in that woman's \nfamily. The Senate cannot jump in now and play medical czar to \npredetermine the outcome of every similar case. Our responsibility is \nto help individuals and their families to avoid the compounded tragedy \nthat occurred in that family.\n  Helping Americans make their wishes clear is paramount. There are a \nvariety of ways this can be done. The 50 States and the District of \nColumbia have made provisions for the declaration of individual \nchoices, often through the creation of an advanced directive or a \nliving will. If the Congress acts, it certainly should not thwart State \nlaws in this area. Our goals should be to increase awareness and access \nand to look for ways to aid the enforcement of those wishes of families \nand the health care system.\n  Certainly, living wills should be encouraged, and thousands of \nAmericans now are looking to fill these forms out. But in many \ninstances, frequently that living will, a piece of paper, is not \nenough. Too often people will still be confused about an individual's \nreal desires. Too often the language will not be clear or subject to \nmisinterpretation. The bioethicist Carl Schneider of the University of \nMichigan said he is ``appalled'' at the number of people who are \nadvising the public that a living will alone will be sufficient. He \nstates:\n\n       Living wills often do not work.\n\n  So the national discussion about end-of-life choices should include \ninformation that will ensure that wishes be carried out, not just \nstated. As national leaders, those of us in the Senate can promote this \ndiscussion.\n  Most folks looking into advanced directives today seem to think they \ncan just avoid a controversy through a living will. Maryland Attorney \nGeneral Joe Curran recently said that 27,000 people in his State alone \ndownloaded the forms over a period of 7 days. That is compared with 600 \ndownloads during just 1 week in January. But, as I have indicated \ntoday--and I know it will be surprising to many Americans--the reality \nis the laws vary with respect to living wills and advanced directives, \nand often they do not ensure enforcement of a patient's wishes. \nTherefore, Americans need to know about vital mechanisms in addition to \nthe living will. For example, the health care proxy, which designates \none person if a person becomes incapacitated, is another approach that \nmay be a value to our citizens because it leaves no doubt as to who \nspeaks for those who cannot speak for themselves.\n\n  There are other options that can help ensure the effectiveness of an \nadvanced directive. My home State uses a document called a ``POLST,'' \nwhich stands\n\n[[Page S3121]]\n\nfor ``Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment,'' a bright-pink \ndocument that physicians place in patients' charts to help nurses and \nhospice workers and other providers follow the wishes of the patients \nfor end-of-life care. Studies show these physician orders, the product \nof a frank discussion between patients, families, and providers, result \nvery often in the kind of end-of-life care that patients desire.\n  There are various approaches being tested in other States as well, \nand the Senate should promote them. One of our most valuable guidelines \nin moving forward should be the 1990 Patient Self-Determination Act. \nIts spirit and letter ought to be honored for two reasons. First, the \nlaw was passed by the Congress to encourage and ease the use of States' \nadvanced directives. It requires many Medicare and Medicaid providers \nto discuss advanced directives and how they will be carried out. Its \nrequirements in that respect are as correct today as they were 15 years \nago.\n  The second requirement of the 1990 Patient Self-Determination Act is \njust as important. It prohibits discrimination against those who do not \nhave an advanced directive. Now, it is estimated that as many as 75 \npercent of Americans do not have an advanced directive to guide their \nend-of-life choices. Under the Patient Self-Determination Act, \nmandating different and discriminatory treatment for Medicare and \nMedicaid patients without advanced directives is specifically ruled \nout. That is the kind of protection I believe all Americans deserve: \nprotection that ensures the preservation of all their choices.\n  Now, I am grateful that Senator Harkin and others are tackling vital \nissues, important issues that often go ignored, such as the concerns of \nthose who are disabled. Americans should expect the Senate, however, to \ndo even more.\n  In this Congress, I will advocate vigorously for three pieces of \nlegislation that take an appropriate Federal approach to key end-of-\nlife issues. If the Senate has a commitment to consider the end of life \nseriously, I would expect those bills to come to a vote. They all \ninvolve issues I have been working on since the early 1970s when I was \ncodirector of the Oregon Gray Panthers and taught gerontology at \nseveral Oregon universities. I have been working to improve care for \nolder people and the dying throughout my service in the Congress and as \na member of the Aging Committee in both the House and the Senate.\n\n  For more than a decade, the people of my home State of Oregon have \nhad a passionate and thoughtful debate on end-of-life issues. Through \nall of this, I have found that our health care system often neglects \nhow people die and how important it is to make dying patients and their \nfamilies more comfortable.\n  Almost half of the dying experience moderate to severe pain in the \nlast days of their lives. It does not have to be that way. The \ndistinguished Presiding Officer is one of our authorities on medical \ntechnology, and he knows medical technology and know-how exist today to \nreduce the suffering that I am describing. What does not exist is a \nmedical system that supports clinicians trying to address these issues \nor a system to support patients and families as they try to find help \nfor pain.\n  I intend to reintroduce the Conquering Pain Act, a bipartisan bill I \nhave written that recognizes that too often at the end of life pain \ngoes untreated for the dying patient. The Conquering Pain Act does not \ntell providers how to practice medicine. It certainly does not override \nthe States' constitutional right to oversee medical practice. But it \ndoes serve to ensure that patients in every corner of our country, 24/\n7, 7 days a week, can get access to help as they try to deal with pain.\n  This legislation creates six regional Family Support Networks to \nassist physicians and families of patients in pain, and it ensures that \nin every single community in this country Americans know where to turn \nto get information and help when loved ones are suffering. Americans \ndeserve to know their health care providers and their families will \nhave resources to ease suffering. I believe the ability to see a loved \none's pain properly treated can help families across this country. It \ncertainly will add dignity and preserve choices at the end of life.\n  My second effort will focus on the vital work of hospice programs. \nMore Americans are familiar with hospice today through Ms. Schiavo's \ncase, but its true purpose may still be somewhat unclear. Hospice \nprograms provide a range of services to control pain and other \nsymptoms, maintain dignity, and provide comfort care, primarily to \nindividuals in their own homes.\n  But the hospice benefit under Medicare needs to be improved. Today, \nabout 20 percent of patients who die in the United States receive \nhospice care, and of that low number few begin their care early enough \nto receive the full benefit of hospice. Medicare requires patients and \ndoctors to stop all treatment that might bring a cure before they can \nbegin hospice treatment. I do not believe--I do not think Senators will \nbelieve--that patients should be required to abandon all hope of \nrecovery to get the good hospice care they need, but that is what the \nMedicare law states today. It makes no sense, and it ought to be \nchanged.\n  My Medicare Hospice Demonstration Act permits patients to seek \nhospice care as they seek a cure. It will not require patients and \ntheir families to abandon hope even as they move towards acceptance. \nFor many, it will result in better care, more control, and more \npeaceful passage through the end of life.\n  Finally, the Senate ought to promote training in what is called \ncomfort care or palliative care in our medical schools. This is a \npractice that is important for the Senate to understand. Comfort care, \npalliative care, helps terminally ill patients live as actively as \npossible and helps their families cope. It neither hastens nor \npostpones death. It is offered in hospice programs, in the home, and in \nother settings. It prevents and relieves suffering by identifying, \nassessing, and treating pain and other problems. Those can include \nphysical problems, emotional problems, and even spiritual concerns. \nPalliative care is appropriate even before hospice care. It is even \ncompatible with aggressive efforts to prolong life, such as \nchemotherapy or radiation therapy.\n  The Palliative Care Training Act will ensure that our country has \nmore trained professionals to offer these critical comfort care \nservices. The legislation addresses a need that the Senate has ignored \ntoo long. Without it, our citizens will not have enough dedicated \nprofessionals to meet this enormous need.\n  As the distinguished Presiding Officer and I have discussed often, we \nare in the middle of a demographic revolution. We will have many more \nolder people. It will not be uncommon for individuals to live beyond \n100, and with Americans living so much longer than they did a century \nago, it is important they have options that work for them. And demand \nfor comfort, for palliative care, is certainly going to grow.\n  With all the American health care system has to offer, there has to \nbe better care for patients and their families at the end of life. I \nhope these three bills I have described will get careful and thoughtful \nexamination in the days ahead and in the hearings that apparently will \nbegin later this the week in the committee on which the distinguished \nPresiding Officer serves.\n  As I have indicated, I believe the Senate has not been appropriately \ncareful in recent weeks. When this body first considered legislation \nregarding Ms. Schiavo, I made my objections known. I was compelled to \nblock the initial version of the legislation, a bill that was put \nforward without hearings, without discussion, and one that threatened \nto turn the Congress into a convention of case-by-case medical czars. \nIn my view, that legislation intruded dangerously on States' rights to \ndetermine medical practice.\n  I worked with colleagues so Congress could pass bipartisan \nlegislation that in my view didn't set that dangerous precedent, \nparticularly as it related to my own State's law that the people of \nOregon have now approved twice. I didn't filibuster that final bill, \nwhich I had concerns about, but my concerns remain. I do not wish to \nsee the steps of the Capitol as the new gathering place for Americans \nto bring their difficult family disputes at the end of life. I \ncertainly do not want to see our Constitution trampled. Unfortunately, \nCongress has now opened the door to both those possibilities.\n\n[[Page S3122]]\n\n  The Senate has a renewed responsibility to do better. Each State's \nconstitutional right to determine medical practice exists whether the \nCongress agrees or disagrees--to put it bluntly, whether Congress likes \nit or not. Congress cannot only respect the principle of States rights \nwhen it thinks the State is right. In the same way, the checks and \nbalances the Founding Fathers set among the executive, legislative, and \njudicial branches, those powers are not up for negotiation because they \nproduce an outcome that is unacceptable to some Americans. Before \nacting, the Senate ought to consider the very nature of federalism that \nhas brought and held our States together for more than two centuries. \nThen the Congress should think carefully about whether it makes sense \nto tear down a basic pillar of our national contract.\n  This body writes Federal laws. If the Senate does not like the effect \nof a Federal law, our prerogative is to change it. But it is not the \nSenate's prerogative to play constitutional chicken when matters happen \noutside of our jurisdiction. That is true no matter how strong our \npersonal passions may be.\n  I have fought for the rights of my State and its voters to decide the \nissue of physician-assisted suicide at home in Oregon. As I make this \npoint, I want to point out that I voted twice against this law as an \nindividual citizen. On two occasions, I cast my personal ballot against \nlegalizing assisted suicide in my State. In addition, I voted against \nFederal funding of assisted suicide as a Member of this body. But the \npeople of my State have spoken on an issue they have a right to decide \nat home in Oregon. As I have said in this body, I intend to defend \ntheir right to make that decision in every way I can.\n  In the case of Ms. Schiavo, I believe that Floridians, through their \nrepresentatives in the State legislature, deserve the same leeway to \ndecide such medical matters for themselves. When Congress ignored the \nfact that Florida's legislature was still working on the case and \nignored the right of the State courts to rule, it sought to weaken \nFlorida's rights, Oregon's rights, and the rights of every State in our \nNation. Any legislation this body passes now should not pose the same \nconstitutional threat. The legislation I have outlined today will not, \nand I will oppose any legislation that does so again.\n  It is an imperfect process even for States to rule on medical \nmatters. End-of-life issues are about the heart and the head, about our \npersonal morals as well as the law. Letting States decide is the rule \nof the Constitution I have sworn to uphold, and I intend to stand up \nfor that principle. It is a critically important principle that the \nSenate stand for. And it is a principle that ought to dictate our \nactions before any legislation comes to a vote on the floor. In \nhearings this week--and in any part of the legislative process--there \nare responsibilities to fulfill before the Senate acts or there is a \nrisk of gravely irresponsible legislation.\n  The Senate should ask: Does any legislation on end of life meet key \ntests? Does it clarify and expand and ensure the choices that \nindividuals and families can make? Does it aid in the honoring of those \nwishes once expressed, whether those wishes are to have life sustained \nor unwanted treatments withheld? Does it protect the rights of those in \nthe disability community and those who are incapacitated, particularly \nwhen they have not had the opportunity to make their wishes known? Does \nit speak to more than the political debates of the moment and truly \ntake in hand the basic issues at the end of life? Does it contribute to \nless pain, better care, and more peace for those at the end of life? \nDoes it fully meet the responsibility of the Senate without usurping \nthe constitutional role of the States and the judiciary? And finally, \ndoes it meet the obligations of the Senate to the American people \nwithout extending our reach into their personal lives?\n  The Senate has an obligation to learn from the events of the last 2 \nweeks. Before acting, let us think. The Senate has been called the \nworld's greatest deliberative body. Let us now be more deliberative as \nwe dare to approach issues that are more intimate and more personal \nthan any others we could discuss.\n  The truth is, Americans' end-of-life choices should not be made by \nstrangers in the Congress, pushed by the passion of one case or the \npolitical priorities that press on every side. Americans are going to \ncontinue to wrestle with end-of-life care for themselves and their \nloved ones for as long as breath is drawn on this soil. Americans will \nbring all they have to bear ethically, morally, and spiritually to make \nthe best decisions for themselves and to honor the decisions of their \nloved ones. The Senate must equal their effort and do its duty with \nhonor for those at the end of life.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

As such, it becomes a vehicle through \nwhich I can try to attach an amendment that would have a significant \npolicy effect upon our defense posture.\n  It is no secret that a number of us have joined in opposing the \nPentagon's plans to scrap one of our 12 aircraft carriers. The aircraft \ncarrier they have selected is the John F. Kennedy, which is home ported \nat Mayport Naval Station, which is in Jacksonville, FL. Naturally, I \nspeak for the interests of Jacksonville and the State of Florida, but I \nspeak with a much larger vision about the defense interests of our \ncountry.\n  For example, if the Pentagon, which I think has made a wrongheaded \ndecision on budgetary reasons--they think it is going to save them a \nbillion dollars when in fact it is not, but even so, if that were true, \nin the middle of a war is not the time for us to be reducing our \nability to protect our forces around the world with these floating air \nfields that we call aircraft carriers. And we only have 12. The \nPentagon is proposing to scrap one of the 12.\n  There is another reason. As a result of the announcement that was \nmade by the Navy this past Friday night after business hours, the Navy \nis going through with the plans on the Kennedy by scrapping the plans \nfor rehabbing it in dry dock. It is not a surprise, but it is a \nconfirmation that it is the John F. Kennedy they are planning to axe. \nThe significance of this from a defense posture is that it leaves all \nof our remaining carriers in the Atlantic fleet home ported in one \nport--Norfolk, VA.\n  The significance of that is in testimony in our Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, over and over, four star admirals have come in front of us \nand said: Don't keep all of your carrier assets in one place. Spread \nthem out.\n  It is no secret that when a terrorist is looking to do some damage of \nclosing up a port, particularly a port that is upriver such as Norfolk, \nwith some one or several carriers that could be in port, just sinking \ndebris in the channel could close up the port. That is not the defense \nposture we want.\n  So there is no one who is in the uniformed military who thinks you \nshould not spread your assets. As a matter of fact, on the west coast, \non the Pacific fleet, we have three ports for aircraft carriers. The \nresponse is: If you are going to scrap the Kennedy, which is a \nconventional carrier, powered by oil, why not then take one of the \nnuclear carriers and put it down at Mayport Naval Station and you have \nachieved the same thing? That would be good, but it is going to take, \naccording to testimony in the Armed Services Committee, a minimum of 5 \nto 7 years before that could happen because of the environmental impact \nstatement that first has to be done and then, secondly, the \nreconfiguring of the docks and the other facilities to be able to \nhandle a nuclear-powered carrier. The result of this is that for 5 to 7 \nyears you do not have another home port for a nuclear\n\n[[Page S3123]]\n\ncarrier on the east coast of the United States, and all of them are \nhome-ported in one place. That is not the defense posture the United \nStates should be in.\n\n  It is another thing to talk about the parochial interests, which I \nrepresent, of Jacksonville and Florida. That is certainly an economic \nhit because Jacksonville, even if they get a nuclear carrier--and by \nthe way, 5 to 7 years down the road it is another administration and \nanother Congress to make those decisions--but in the meantime, \nJacksonville doesn't have a carrier for 5 to 7 years, with the economic \nhit that takes place and the Nation doesn't have its carrier assets \nspread on the Atlantic coast of this country. That is not a position we \nshould have.\n  I am going to offer a compromise, since it seems that the Pentagon is \nabsolutely intent on scrapping--they call it mothballing--this carrier. \nThe compromise I am suggesting, and I talked to the Vice Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs just moments ago, is since the Navy and the Pentagon \nhave decided they are not going to rehab the John F. Kennedy in a dry \ndock and save that expense, but the Kennedy can remain operational for \nthe next 3 to 4 to 5 years without being rehabbed in dry dock, let us \nkeep our assets dispersed on the east coast until these decisions are \nmade and the facilities are changed so we can spread our nuclear \ncarrier assets.\n  That does another thing for the defense policy of this country. There \nis a question coming up in 2008, when the conventionally powered \naircraft carrier Kitty Hawk is scheduled to be decommissioned. She is \nnow home-ported in Japan because Japan, the Japanese Government, has \nhad a policy of not accepting a nuclear carrier. What happens if by \n2008 the Japanese Government does not change the policy and will not \nreceive a nuclear carrier? Then we ought to have the John F. Kennedy \nkept alive in an operational status where it can fill that role and, \nover the course of the next 3 years coming up to 2008--and we are in \n2005 right now--we will know the status.\n  From the standpoint of defense policy, No. 1, of spreading our \ncarrier assets, the compromise I am offering makes sense. No. 2, from \nthe standpoint of being able to respond quickly if we needed another \nconventionally powered carrier in Japan, we would have a backup \nconventional carrier in 2008 if the Japanese Government would not \nreceive a nuclear carrier. And, No. 3, it would not disrupt the lives \nof all those Jacksonville families by suddenly abolishing one of our \ncarriers and all of the 5,000 sailors and their families and perhaps \nother ships in the carrier battle group that would go away. It seems to \nme it is the prudent defense policy thing to do.\n  I know if I offer this, if it is not being considered in the \nPentagon, that I am swimming upstream. But I think it is worth the \nfight, not only as a Senator representing Florida but as a member of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee; it is a matter of protection, of \nthe defense interests of this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized to speak for up to 10 minutes, but then following my remarks \nthat the Senator from Tennessee be recognized for any remarks he might \nhave, and following the conclusion of his remarks that I might then be \nrecognized at that time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today we mourn the passing of a great man. \nIn the long history of Roman Catholic Popes, John Paul II is among the \ngreatest in championing human dignity. He also was a champion for the \nsanctity of human life and for the family and for working for the good \nof his Church. He is the kind of leader who only comes along once in a \nvery great long time.\n  As the most traveled pontiff of all time, Pope John Paul personally \ndelivered hope, encouragement, and inspiration to more people in more \nplaces than any other person in human history. And he was especially \nbeloved by the youth, the future of our world, with whom he had a very \nspecial relationship.\n  Catholics and non-Catholics alike should feel fortunate to have had \nsuch a leader in our midst, a man who gave so much to humanity.\n  Undeterred, perhaps even driven a bit harder by an assassin's \nbullets, this devout man embarked on an exhausting journey over a \nquarter of a century to spread words of freedom, compassion, and \njustice. His mission seems to have been nothing less than redemption of \nthe world. Surely, but for men such as this, the world would have long \nfallen into irreparable chaos and decline.\n  Elected Bishop of Rome on October 16, 1978, Pope John Paul II's faith \nand courage was forged and proven as a Polish priest standing up to the \nhorrors of the Soviet Union. He took his stance at a time when \ndissidents were whisked away in the dark, never to be heard from again. \nYet John Paul's perseverance eventually awakened the soul of a nation \nof secret believers who stood in candlelit solidarity to bring down an \nevil empire.\n  According to Harvard theologian George Williams, a Protestant who \nbefriended the Pope many years ago, he is an imposing man in physique, \nbig in intellectual vision, who deeply enjoys people. In a most \nremarkable way, he is a man whose soul is at leisure with himself.\n  Only two Popes have served longer and none with more sustained vigor, \nclarity, or cheerfulness. Even after his step faltered and his voice \nbegan to waiver, he bore his infirmities with honor and humor. Although \nhis body was failing, his indomitable spirit continued to touch the \nworld and teach us about the strength and promise of the human heart.\n  This great Pope was loved by people of various religions and across \nideological spectrums. Even many who disagreed with him respected his \ngrand vision and his convictions. Having captured the world's attention \nand admiration by standing for our better angels for so long, Pope John \nPaul II will surely stand with President Ronald Reagan as one of the \ngiants of our time.\n  Both men understood deeply where the hope of mankind lay--in faith, \nin courage, in liberty. On October 11, 2001, 1 month after the \ndevastating terrorist attacks of 9/11, John Paul offered this prayer:\n\n       O God almighty and merciful, he who sows discord cannot \n     understand You. He who loves violence cannot welcome You. \n     Watch over us in our painful condition, tried by the brutal \n     acts of terrorism and death. Comfort Your children and open \n     our hearts to hope that in our time, we again may know \n     serenity and peace.\n\n  I can only add my own amen to that prayer.\n  I yield the floor to Senator Alexander under the terms of the \nprevious order.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas. I join \nwith him in his thoughts about Pope John Paul II and the thoughts of \nour other colleagues that have been expressed. He was a man of \nsincerity and great character. He traveled more than any other Pope. He \ntraveled the United States more than any other Pope. He carried a \nmessage of peace. He carried a message of charity. He had a profound \nimpact on the world and his native country of Poland. It can fairly be \nsaid that Poland would not have overthrown communism, at least not when \nit did, had it not been for Pope John Paul.\n  I remember in 1987, our family had lived in Australia for 6 months, \nthree teenagers and a 7-year-old, and we came home from around the \nworld in a little different way. We took a train from Moscow to Paris. \nThis was before the Berlin Wall came down. All of us, our different \nages in our family, remember how in Poland the churches were open and \nvibrant, they were active, and people were there. In Russia, they were \nmuseums. We thought about that. We think about that today as we\n\n[[Page S3124]]\n\nreflect back on the role of this man who was an example for each of us \nand who deserves the world's attention, the world's prayers, and the \nworld's acclaim.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/04/senate-section/article/S3124-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             EIGHT-DAY BIPARTISAN CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I have remarks that I would like to \nmake on two different subjects. One has to do with a visit by a \ndelegation of Senators led by the Democratic leader, the Senator from \nNevada, Mr. Reid, and then a brief remark about the proposal that we \nuse the supplemental appropriations bill to turn State driver's \nlicenses into national identification cards.\n  First I will comment on the 8-day congressional delegation that I was \na part of over the last recess. It was led, as I said, by the \nDemocratic leader. Let me say first how much I appreciate the style of \nhis leadership. He is the Democratic leader, and occasionally there is \na partisan word in this place, but this was a bipartisan delegation. We \nvisited eight countries in 8 days, including Jerusalem, Israel, the \nPalestinian territories--visited leaders of the Palestinian Authority--\nwe visited Kuwait, Iraq, Georgia, and the Ukraine. In France, we \nreceived a NATO briefing from our ranking general.\n  I think it is important for this body to know that in all of his \npublic and private comments, the Democratic leader spoke for the \nadministration of the U.S. Government. In other words, whatever his \nprivate views of policy difference might have been, he did not express \nthose outside of this country. I was not surprised by that--I think \nthat is the way it ought to be--but I was impressed by that. I was \nimpressed by that part of his attitude, by the bipartisan quality of \nthe delegation, and by the hard work he expected of those on the \ndelegation. I appreciated the chance to be included, and I appreciated \nhis leadership.\n  As I am sure the Senator from North Carolina, who occupies the chair, \nknows, and the Senator from Texas feels the same way, there are so many \nthousands of people--in my case, Tennesseans--serving in Iraq and \nKuwait that I almost felt at home visiting there last week. My wife \nHoney and I were greeted at the Kuwait Airport by an Army reservist who \nis publisher of the Dyersburg News and copublisher of the State \nGazette. We had dinner with the 844th Engineer Combat Battalion, which \nis based in Knoxville, which includes more than 500 Tennesseans. One of \nthose reservists is SGT Amanda Bunch, a nursing assistant at Asbury \nAcres in Maryville, my hometown where my mother and grandfather lived \nfor a few years. The school superintendent from Athens, just down the \nroad from my hometown; the president of the Lexington Rotary Club in \nwest Tennessee, a physician; three Blount County deputies, from my home \ncounty--all among those serving in the Tennessee National Guard.\n\n  I may have felt at home, but as LTC Don Dinello, who commands the \n844th, reminded me, no place there is entirely safe. A few days \nearlier, a patrol had discovered explosives on a bridge over which the \ncolonel's soldiers might have traveled. Thankfully, the explosive \ndevice was disarmed before anyone was hurt.\n  In Baghdad, I ate lunch with three marines who were recent high \nschool graduates from Savannah, Manchester, and Tullahoma, TN. Their \nmission is to guard the U.S. Embassy. I asked one of these young men \nwhat a U.S. Senator should know about their work. Andrew Pottier of \nSavannah told me:\n\n       Not much to know, sir. They shoot at us and we just shoot \n     them back.\n\n  Not even in the Green Zone, where several thousand Americans work \nevery day, was it entirely safe. The protocol officer greeted us \nwearing a nice green dress covered by a flack jacket. When one of the \nmembers of our delegation, a female Senator, went to the ladies \nrestroom, a female soldier with an AK-47 went first, inspecting every \nstall.\n  I was reminded just a couple of days ago how dangerous it can be when \nI went to the funeral in Sevier County of SGT Paul W. Thomason, III, \nthe first member of our National Guard unit, the 278th, to be killed.\n  It is very difficult to grasp the reality of the security situation \nin Iraq. It is hard to grasp it from television. On the one hand, there \nis the danger I just described. On the other hand, our casualties are \nsignificantly down. Twelve of the 17 Iraqi provinces, we were told by \nour commanders there, are relatively without incident. An average of \n800 supply trucks convoy each day from Kuwait to the edge of Baghdad. \nSince August, there have been 166 attacks on these trucks, killing 2 \nsoldiers.\n  Forty percent of those serving in Iraq and Kuwait are reservists or \nguardsmen. Several thousand of them are from Tennessee. Most left \nbehind families, jobs, and mortgages for up to 18 months. Far from \nhome, they are dealing with child custody, insurance, births, and \ndeaths. Thirty percent of the members of the 844th unit, with whom I \nvisited, are continuing their education online. I brought home \ninformation so I could help seven reservists who are having trouble \nwith their citizenship applications.\n  Here are three other thoughts from that visit:\n  One, armored vehicles. Commanders in Kuwait assured me that no humvee \nor truck is now going into a combat zone without Level I or Level II \narmor.\n  Second, in the training of Iraq forces, we met with GEN David \nPatraeus, the former commander of Fort Campbell's 101st Airborne \nDivision and one of our most accomplished military leaders. He \npersuaded me and I think most other members of our delegation that \ntraining is proceeding in an impressive way. It is not complete, but we \nare making progress.\n  Finally, infant democracies. We have sacrificed many lives and paid a \nheavy price in dollars to invade Iraq and remove Saddam Hussein, but \nwithout that decision there would be no infant democracies in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Georgia, Ukraine, and Kuwait would be less democratic, and \nSyria would not be pulling troops out of Lebanon. We in the world are \nsafer without Saddam Hussein, who the new Prime Minister designate of \nIraq, if he is elected, told us, in his words, that Saddam had buried \nalive 300,000 people.\n  When will our troops come home? I do not know. I believe we must have \na success strategy, not just an exit strategy. This strategy should be \nbased on whether Iraqis can reasonably defend themselves and whether \nthey have some sort of constitutional government. Having liberated \nIraq, it is now not our job to stay there until there is a perfect \ndemocracy.\n  We Americans are very impatient. We also sometimes have short \nmemories. We are expecting the Iraqis to come up with a constitution by \nAugust. It took America 12 years to write a constitution after \ndeclaring our independence, another 130 years to give women the right \nto vote in this country, and nearly 200 years before African Americans \nwere allowed to vote in every part of America.\n  I hope after the two Iraqi elections scheduled for the end of 2005 \nthat we will begin to see large numbers of Tennesseans coming home; for \nour average stay in other instances where the United States has helped \nbuild nations, as in Germany and Japan, has been about 5 years.\n  The Presbyterian Chaplain of the 844th--which I visited--Rev. Tim \nFary from Rhea County, I discovered I had met before. He was then 8 \nyears old and I was Governor of Tennessee. I was playing a piano \nconcert with the Chattanooga Symphony at a July concert at Chickamauga \nnear Chattanooga. Tim Fary, 8 years old, was lost.\n  He told me:\n\n       When I found my parents 2 hours later, I had a handwritten \n     note that read, ``Dear Tim: Thank you for your advice. \n     Governor Lamar Alexander.'' That note kept me out of trouble. \n     I still have it.\n\n  We hope Tim's prayers, as well as our own, will keep our brave \nTennesseans safe so they can accomplish their mission and come home \nsoon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/04/senate-section/article/S3124-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3124-S3128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DRIVER'S LICENSES\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I would now like to speak for 4 or 5 \nminutes on another subject. I again thank the Senator from Texas. This \nis a subject that I recently wrote an op-ed about, which was published \nlast week in the Washington Post. Fearing that many of my colleagues \nmight have been in places such as Texas or Tennessee or Iraq and might \nhave missed\n\n[[Page S3125]]\n\nit, I will make virtually the same remarks here.\n  Specifically, I am concerned about the so-called ``Real ID Act,'' a \nbill recently passed by the House of Representatives that would require \nStates to turn 190 million driver's licenses into national \nidentification cards, with State taxpayers, I am afraid, paying most of \nthe costs.\n  The first thing wrong here is that some House Members want to stick \nthat identification card proposal on the appropriations bill that \nsupports troops in Iraq. We should not slow down money for our troops \nwhile we debate identification cards.\n  The second problem is that States not only get to create these \nidentification cards, States will likely end up paying the bill. This \nis one more of the unfunded Federal mandates that we Republicans \nespecially promised to stop.\n  Supporters argue this is no mandate because States have a choice. \nWell, true. States may refuse to conform to the proposed Federal \nstandards and issue licenses to whomever they choose, including illegal \nimmigrants. But, if they do, States' licenses will not be accepted for \n``Federal purposes,'' such as boarding an airplane. That is some \nchoice. What Governor will deny his or her citizens the identification \nthey need to travel by air or to cash Social Security checks or for \n``other Federal purposes?''\n  Of course, this identification card idea might backfire on us, the \nMembers of Congress. Some feisty Governor might ask: Who are these \npeople in Washington telling us what to do with our driver's licenses \nand making us pay for them, too?\n  A Governor, let us say from California, might say: California will \nuse its licenses for certifying drivers, and Congress can create its \nown identification cards for people who want to fly and do other \nfederally regulated things. And, if they do not, I will put on the \nInternet the home telephone numbers of all the Congressmen.\n  That is what some feisty Governor might say.\n  If just one State refuses to do the Federal Government identification \nwork, Congress would be forced to create what it claims to oppose, a \nFederal identification card for citizens of that State.\n  Finally, if we must have a better identification card for some \nFederal purposes, there may be better ideas than turning State driver's \nlicense examiners into CIA agents. For example, Congress might create \nan airline traveler's card, or there could be an expanded-use U.S. \npassport. Since a motive here is to discourage illegal immigration, \nprobably the most logical idea is to upgrade the Social Security card, \nwhich directly relates to the reason most immigrants come to the United \nStates, to work.\n  I have fought government identification cards as long and as hard as \nanyone in this Chamber. In 1983, when I was Governor of Tennessee, our \nTennessee Legislature voted to put photographs on driver's licenses. \nMerchants and policemen wanted a State identification card to \ndiscourage check fraud and teenage drinking. I vetoed this photo \ndriver's license bill twice because I believed driver's licenses should \nbe about driving and that State identification cards infringed on civil \nliberties.\n  That same year, 1983, I visited the White House on the annual visit \nthat Governors have with the President of the United States. As I got \nto the gate, a White House guard asked for my photo identification.\n  I said to the guard: We don't have photo driver's licenses in \nTennessee. I vetoed them.\n  The guard said: Well, you can't get in without one.\n  Fortunately, the Governor of Georgia, the late George Busbee, was \nstanding there next to me. He had his Georgia photo driver's license. \nHe vouched for me. I was admitted to the White House.\n  The legislature at home overrode my veto, and I gave up my fight \nagainst the State identification card. For years, the State driver's \nlicenses have served as a de facto national identification card. But \nthey have been unreliable. All but one of the 9/11 terrorists had valid \ndriver's licenses.\n  Even today, when I board an airplane, as I did this morning, security \nofficials look at the front of my driver's license, which expired in \n2000, and rarely turn it over to verify that it has been extended until \n2005.\n  My point is, we already have a national identification card. They are \ncalled driver's licenses. They are just ineffective.\n  I still detest the idea of a government identification card. South \nAfrica's experience is a grim reminder of how such documents can be \nabused.\n  But I am afraid this is one of the ways 9/11 has changed our lives. \nInstead of pretending that we are not creating national identification \ncards, when we obviously are, I believe Congress should carefully \ncreate an effective Federal document that helps prevent terrorism with \nas much respect for privacy as possible.\n  I thank the Senator from Texas for his courtesy. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                             FEDERAL COURTS\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wanted to talk a little bit about our \ncourts, and specifically our Federal courts, and even more specifically \nthe United States Supreme Court.\n  Before I start, let me just say I have the greatest respect for our \njudiciary, the men and women who wear black robes--whether it is on a \nmunicipal court or a county court or a district court like I served on \nin San Antonio, Bexar County, TX, for 6 years, or those who work on \nappellate courts, whether State or Federal, like I did on the Texas \nSupreme Court for 7 years.\n  For 13 years of my professional life, I have worn a black robe, \njudging cases, first presiding over the jury trials, and coming to have \na great deal of respect not just for those judges but for men and women \nwho serve on juries and decide hard cases, cases which, perhaps, they \nwould prefer not have to sit in judgment of, some involving even the \ndeath penalty.\n  I don't want anyone to misunderstood what I say as being a blanket \ncriticism of either the judiciary or the U.S. Supreme Court, in \nparticular. From my own experience, judges, although they have \nimportant jobs to do, are no different than you and I. They are mere \nmortals, subject to the same flashes of mediocrity, sometimes making \nmistakes, and sometimes displaying flights of brilliance. These are \nnot, as some people have suggested, high priests able to discern great \ntruths that you and I are unable to figure out. They are generally very \nintelligent, with outstanding educational pedigrees, but no one has \nagreed that judges, particularly Federal judges, can be or should be a \nlaw unto themselves.\n  Federal judges are appointed subject to advice and consent provisions \nof the Constitution for a lifetime. They do not run for election. They \ndo not have to raise money as do other politicians. I know those who do \nenvy them that. But the idea is they are supposed to use that \nindependence in order to be impartial umpires of the law--it is called \nballs and strikes--and they should use that independence that has been \ngiven to them in order to resist politics, in order to resist those who \nwould suggest that in order to be popular you must subscribe to a \nparticular way of thinking or a particular social or political or \nideological agenda.\n  Given that framework the Founding Fathers agreed was so important and \nthat I know we all agree is important today to preserve that \nindependence so as to preserve that judicial function, it causes a lot \nof people, including me, great distress to see judges use the authority \nthey have been given to make raw political or ideological decisions. No \none, including those judges, including the judges on the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, should be surprised if one of us stands up and objects.\n  I make clear I object to some of the decisionmaking process occurring \nat the U.S. Supreme Court today and now. So far as the Supreme Court \nhas taken on this role as a policymaker rather than an enforcer of \npolitical decisions made by elected representatives of the people, it \nhas led to increasing divisiveness and bitterness of our confirmation \nfights that is a very current problem this body faces. It has generated \na lack of respect for judges generally. Why should people respect a \njudge for making a policy decision born out of an ideological \nconviction any more than they would respect or deny\n\n[[Page S3126]]\n\nthemselves the opportunity to disagree if that decision were made by an \nelected representative? The difference is they can throw the rascal out \nand we are sometimes perceived as the rascal if they do not like the \ndecisions made, but they cannot vote against a judge, because judges \nare not elected. They serve for a lifetime on the Federal bench.\n  The increasing politicization of the judicial decisionmaking process \nat the highest levels of our judiciary has bred a lack of respect for \nsome of the people who wear the robe. That is a national tragedy.\n  Finally, I don't know if there is a cause-and-effect connection, but \nwe have seen some recent episodes of courthouse violence in this \ncountry--certainly nothing new; we seem to have run through a spate of \ncourthouse violence recently that has been on the news. I \nwonder whether there may be some connection between the perception in \nsome quarters on some occasions where judges are making political \ndecisions yet are unaccountable to the public, that it builds and \nbuilds to the point where some people engage in violence, certainly \nwithout any justification, but that is a concern I have that I wanted \nto share.\n\n  We all are students of history in this Senate, we all have been \nelected to other bodies and other offices, and we are all familiar with \nthe founding documents, the Declaration of Independence, the \nConstitution itself. We are familiar with the Federalist Papers that \nwere written in an effort to get the Constitution ratified in New York \nState. Alexander Hamilton, apropos of what I will talk about, authored \na series of essays in the Federalist Papers that opine that the \njudicial branch would be what he called the ``least dangerous branch of \ngovernment.'' He pointed out that the judiciary lacked the power of the \nexecutive branch, the White House, for example, in the Federal \nGovernment and the political passions of the legislature. In other \nwords, the Congress. Its sole purpose--that is, the Federal judiciary's \nsole purpose--was to objectively interpret and apply the laws of the \nland and in such a role its job would be limited.\n  Let me explain perhaps in greater detail why I take my colleagues' \ntime to criticize some of the decisionmaking being made by some Federal \ncourts in some cases. This is not a blanket condemnation. I hope I have \nmade it clear I respect the men and women who wear the robe, but having \nbeen a judge myself I can state that part of the job of a judge is to \ncriticize the reasoning and the justification for a particular \njudgment. I certainly did that daily as a state supreme court justice. \nAnd I might add that people felt free to criticize my decisions, my \nreasoning and justification for the judgments I would render. That is \npart of the give and take that goes into this. I make clear my respect \ngenerally for the Federal judiciary, including the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I am troubled when I read decisions such as Roper v. Simmons. This is \na recent decision from March 1, 2005. Let me state what that case was \nabout. This was a case involving Christopher Simmons. Christopher \nSimmons was seven months shy of his 18th birthday when he murdered \nShirley Crook. This is a murder he planned to commit. Before committing \nthe crime, this 17-year-old who was 7 months shy of his 18th birthday, \nencouraged his friends to join him, assuring them that they could ``get \naway with it,'' because they were minors. Christopher Simmons and his \ncohorts broke into the home of an innocent woman, bound her with duct \ntape and electrical wire, and then threw her off a bridge, alive and \nconscious, resulting in her subsequent death.\n  Those facts led a jury in Missouri, using the law in Missouri that \nthe people of Missouri had chosen for themselves through their elected \nrepresentatives, to convict him of capital murder and to sentence him \nto death.\n  Well, this 17-year-old boy, or young man I guess is what I would call \nhim, Christopher Simmons, challenged that jury verdict and that \nconviction all the way through the State courts of Missouri and all the \nway to the U.S. Supreme Court. And the United States Supreme Court, on \nMarch 1, 2005, held that Christopher Simmons or any other person in the \nUnited States of America who is under the age of 18 who commits such a \nheinous and premeditated and calculated murder cannot be given the \ndeath penalty because it violates the U.S. Constitution.\n  In so holding, the U.S. Supreme Court said: We are no longer going to \nleave this in the hands of jurors. We do not trust jurors. We are no \nlonger going to leave this up to the elected representatives of the \npeople of the respective States, even though 20 States, including \nMissouri, have the possibility at least of the death penalty being \nassessed in the most aggravated types of cases, involving the most \nheinous crimes, against someone who is not yet 18.\n  This is how the Court decided to do that. First, it might be of \ninterest to my colleagues that 15 years earlier the same U.S. Supreme \nCourt, sitting in Washington, across the street from this Capitol where \nwe are standing today, held just the opposite. Fifteen years ago, the \nU.S. Supreme Court held that under appropriate circumstances, given the \nproper safeguards, in the worst cases involving the most depraved and \npremeditated conduct, a jury could constitutionally convict someone of \ncapital murder and sentence them to the death penalty. But 15 years \nlater, on March 1, they said what was constitutional the day before was \nno longer constitutional, wiping 20 States' laws off the books and \nreversing this death penalty conviction for Christopher Simmons.\n  What I want to focus on now is the reasoning that Justice Anthony \nKennedy, writing for the U.S. Supreme Court, in a 5-to-4 decision, used \nto reach that conclusion.\n  First, Justice Kennedy adopted a test for determining whether this \ndeath penalty conviction was constitutional. This ought to give you \nsome indication of the problems we have with the Supreme Court as a \npolicymaker with no fixed standards or objective standards by which to \ndetermine its decisions to make its judgments. The Court embraced a \ntest that it had adopted earlier referring to the ``evolving standards \nof decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.'' Let me \nrepeat that. The test they used was the ``evolving standards of decency \nthat mark the progress of a maturing society.''\n  I would think any person of reasonable intelligence, listening to \nwhat I am saying, would say: What was that? How do you determine those \n``evolving standards''? And if they are one way on one day, how do they \nevolve to be something different the next day? And what is a ``maturing \nsociety''? How do we determine whether society has matured? I think \npeople would be justified in asking: Isn't that fancy window dressing \nfor a preordained conclusion? I will let them decide.\n  Well, it does not get much better because then the Court, in order to \ndetermine whether the facts met that standard, such as that this death \npenalty could not stand, or these laws in 20 States cannot stand, \nlooked to what they called an ``emerging consensus.'' Well, any student \nof high school civics knows we have a Federal system, and the national \nGovernment does not dictate to the State governments all aspects of \ncriminal law. In fact, most criminal law is decided in State courts in \nthe first place.\n  Nevertheless, the Supreme Court of the United States, in a 5-to-4 \ndecision, looked for an ``emerging consensus'' and in the process wiped \n20 States' laws off the books. I will not go into the details of how \nthey found a consensus, but suffice it to say it ought to be that in a \nnation comprised of 50 separate sovereign State governments, where 20 \nStates disagree with the Court on its decision that wipes those 20 \nStates' courts laws off the books, it can hardly be called a consensus, \nif language is to have any meaning.\n  Secondly, the Court said: We will also look to our own decisions, our \nown judgment over the propriety of this law. In other words, they are \ngoing to decide because they can, because basically their decisions are \nnot appealable, and there is nowhere else to go if they decide this law \nis unconstitutional. The American people, the people of Missouri, the \npeople who support, under limited circumstances, under appropriate \nchecks and balances, the death penalty for people who commit heinous \ncrimes under the age of 18 are simply out of luck; this is the end of \nthe line.\n  Well, finally--and this is the part I want to conclude on and speak \non for a\n\n[[Page S3127]]\n\nfew minutes--the Court demonstrated a disconcerting tendency to rely on \nthe laws of foreign governments and even treaties in the application \nand enforcement of U.S. law. This is a trend that did not start with \nthe Roper case, but I did want to mention it in that connection.\n  But if the U.S. Supreme Court is not going to look to the laws of the \nUnited States, including the fundamental law of the United States, \nwhich is the Constitution, but interpreting what is and is not \nconstitutional under the U.S. Constitution by looking at what foreign \ngovernments and foreign laws have to say about that same issue, I fear \nthat bit by bit and case by case the American people are slowly losing \ncontrol over the meaning of our laws and the Constitution itself. If \nthis trend continues, foreign governments may have a say in what our \nlaws and our Constitution mean and what our policies in America should \nbe.\n  Let me digress a second to say this is as current as the daily news. \nAs a matter of fact, I saw in the New York Times on April 2 an article \nconcerning Justice Ginsburg, a member of that five-member majority in \nthe Roper case. The headline is: ``Justice Ginsburg Backs Value of \nForeign Law.'' Reading from this story, written by Anne Kornblut, it \nsays:\n\n       In her speech, Justice Ginsburg criticized the resolutions \n     in Congress and the spirit in which they were written.\n\n  She is referring to a resolution I have filed, and I sent out a \n``dear colleague'' today expressing concerns about this issue. But she \nsaid:\n\n       Although I doubt the resolutions will pass this Congress--\n\n  I don't know where she gets her information. I think there is a lot \nof positive sentiment in favor of what the resolution says, and I will \ntalk about that in a minute.\n\n       Although I doubt the resolutions will pass this Congress, \n     it is disquieting that they have attracted sizable support.\n\n  I am a little surprised that a sitting U.S. Supreme Court Justice \nwould engage in a debate about a current matter, which has yet to be \ndecided by the Senate, which is a resolution expressing concern about \nthe use of foreign laws and treaties to interpret what the U.S. \nConstitution should mean. I am a little surprised by it.\n  In a series of cases over the past few years our courts have begun to \ntell us that our criminal laws and our criminal policies are informed \nnot just by our Constitution and by the policy preferences and \nlegislative enactments of the American people through their elected \nrepresentatives, but also by the rulings of foreign courts. I \nunderstand it is hard to believe, and most people listening to what I \nam saying are asking themselves: Could this be true? Is it possible? I \nknow it is hard to believe, but in a series of recent cases, including \nthe Roper case, the U.S. Supreme Court has actually rejected its own \nprior decisions in part because a foreign government or court has \nexpressed disagreement with the conclusion they had reached.\n  Until recently the U.S. Supreme Court had long held that under \nappropriate safeguards and procedures, the death penalty may be imposed \nby the States regardless of the IQ of the perpetrator. The Court had \ntraditionally left this issue untouched as a matter for the American \npeople and each of their States to decide, as the Court said in a case \ncalled Penry V. Lynaugh in 1989. Yet because some foreign governments \nhad frowned upon that ruling, the U.S. has now seen fit to take that \nissue away from the American people entirely. In 2002, in a case called \nAtkins v. Virginia, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the Commonwealth \nof Virginia could no longer apply its criminal justice system and its \ndeath penalty to an individual who had been duly convicted of \nabduction, armed robbery, and capital murder because of the testimony \nthat the defendant was mildly mentally retarded. The reason given for \nthis reversal of the Court's position that it had taken in 1989 to \n2002? In part it was because the Court was concerned about ``the world \ncommunity'' and the views of the European Union.\n  Take another example. The U.S. Supreme Court had long held that the \nAmerican people in each of the States have the discretion to decide \nwhat kinds of conduct that have long been considered immoral under \nlongstanding legal traditions should or should not remain illegal. In \nBowers v. Hardwick in 1986, the Court held that it is up to the \nAmerican people to decide whether criminal laws against sodomy should \nbe continued or abandoned. Yet once again because foreign governments \nhave frowned upon that ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court saw fit in 2003, \nin Lawrence v. Texas, to hold that no State's criminal justice system \nor its criminal justice laws could be written in a way to reflect the \nmoral convictions and judgments of their people.\n  The reason given for this reversal from 1986 to 2002? This time the \nCourt explained that it was concerned about the European Court of Human \nRights and the European Convention on Human Rights.\n  I have already mentioned the case of Roper v. Simmons. But most \nrecently, on March 28, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a \ncase that will consider whether foreign nationals duly convicted of the \nmost heinous crimes will nevertheless be entitled to a new trial for \nreasons that those individuals did not even bother to bring up during \ntheir trial. As in the previous examples, the Supreme Court has already \nanswered this issue but decided to revisit it once again. In 1998, in \nBreard v. Green, the Court made clear that criminal defendants, like \nall parties in lawsuits, may not sit on their rights and must bring \nthem up at the time the case is going on or be prohibited from raising \nthose issues later on, perhaps even years later. That is a basic \nprinciple of our legal system. In this case, the Court has decided to \nrevisit whether an accused who happens to be a foreign national, \nsubject to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, should be \ntreated differently from any other litigant in our civil litigation \nsystems and in State and Federal courts or in the Federal system \nreviewing State criminal justice provisions.\n  Even this basic principle of American law may soon be reversed. Many \nlegal experts predict that in the upcoming case of Medilline v. Dretke, \nthe Court may overturn itself again for no other reason than that the \nInternational Court of Justice happens to disagree with our \nlongstanding laws and legal principles. This particular case involves \nthe State of Texas. I have filed an amicus brief, a friend of the court \nbrief, in that decision, asking the Court to allow the people of Texas \nto determine their own criminal laws and policies consistent with the \nU.S. States Constitution and not subject to the veto of the Vienna \nConvention on Consular Rights or the decision of some international \ncourt.\n  There is a serious risk, however, that the Court will ignore Texas \nlaw, will ignore U.S. law, will reverse itself, and decide in effect \nthat the decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court can be overruled by the \nInternational Court of Justice.\n  I won't dwell on this any longer, but suffice it to say there are \nother examples and other decisions where we see Supreme Court Justices \nciting legal opinions from foreign courts across the globe as part of \nthe justification for their decisions interpreting the U.S. \nConstitution. These decisions, these legal opinions from foreign courts \nrange from countries such as India, Jamaica, Zimbabwe, and the list \ngoes on and on.\n\n  I am concerned about this trend. Step by step, with each case where \nthis occurs, the American people may be losing their ability to \ndetermine what their laws should be, losing control in part due to the \nopinions of foreign courts and foreign governments. If this happens to \ncriminal law, it can also spread to other areas of our Government and \nour sovereignty. How about our economic policy, foreign policy? How \nabout our decisions about our own security?\n  Most Americans would be disturbed if we gave foreign governments the \npower to tell us what our Constitution means. Our Founding Fathers \nfought the Revolutionary War precisely to stop foreign governments--in \nthis case, Great Britain--from telling us what our laws should be or \nwhat the rules should be by which we would be governed. In fact, ending \nforeign control over American law was one of the very reasons given for \nour War of Independence.\n  The Declaration of Independence itself specifically complains that \nthe American Revolution was justified in\n\n[[Page S3128]]\n\npart because King George ``has combined with others to subject us to a \njurisdiction foreign to our Constitution and unacknowledged by our \nlaws.''\n  After a long and bloody revolution, we earned the right at last to be \nfree of such foreign control. Rather, it was we the people of the \nUnited States who then ordained and established a Constitution of the \nUnited States and our predecessors, our forefathers, specifically \nincluded a mechanism by which we the people of the United States could \nchange it by amendment, if necessary.\n  Of course, every judge who serves on a Federal court swears to an \noath to ``faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the \nduties incumbent upon me . . . under the Constitution and laws of the \nUnited States, so help me God.''\n  As you can tell, I am concerned about this trend. I am concerned that \nthis trend may reflect a growing distrust amongst legal elites--not \nonly a distrust of our constitutional democracy, but a distrust of the \nAmerican people and America itself.\n  As every high school civics student knows, the job of a judge is \npretty straightforward. Judges are supposed to follow the law, not \nrewrite it. Judges are supposed to enforce and apply political \ndecisions that are made in Congress and that are signed into law by the \nPresident of the United States. Judges are not supposed to make those \ndecisions or substitute their own judgments or those political \njudgments hashed out in the legislative process in this body and this \nCapitol. The job of a judge is to read and obey the words contained in \nour laws and in our judicial precedents--not the laws and precedents of \nforeign governments, which have no authority over our Nation or the \nAmerican people.\n  I am concerned that some judges who simply don't like our laws--and \nthey don't like the decisions made by Americans through their elected \nrepresentatives here about what those laws should be--are using this as \nanother way to justify their decision to overreach. So it appears they \nwould rather rewrite the law from the bench. What is especially \ndisconcerting is that some judges today may be departing so far from \nAmerican law, from American principles, and from American traditions \nthat the only way they can justify their rulings is to cite the law of \nforeign countries, foreign governments, and foreign cultures, because \nthere is nothing left for them to cite for support in this country.\n  Citing foreign law in order to overrule U.S. policy offends our \ndemocracy because foreign lawmaking is obviously in no way accountable \nto the American people. Here again--and I started out by saying I am \nnot condemning all Federal judges; I have great respect for the Federal \njudiciary--I am not condemning international law. Obviously, there is a \nway by which international law can apply to the United States, and that \nis through the treaty process, which is, of course, subject to \nratification by the U.S. Congress.\n  There is an important role for international law in our system, but \nit is a role that belongs to the American people through the political \nbranches--the Congress and the President--to decide what that role \nshould be and indeed what that law should be; it is not a role given to \nour courts. Article I of the U.S. Constitution gives the Congress, not \nthe courts, the authority to enact laws punishing ``Offenses against \nthe Law of Nations,'' and article II of the Constitution gives the \nPresident the power to ratify treaties, subject to the advice and \nconsent and the approval of two-thirds of the Senate. Yet our courts \nappear to be, in some instances, overruling U.S. law by citing foreign \nlaw decisions in which the U.S. Congress had no role and citing \ntreaties that the President and the U.S. Senate have refused to \napprove.\n  To those who might say there is nothing wrong with simply trying to \nbring U.S. laws into consistency with other nations, I say this: This \nis not a good faith attempt to bring U.S. law into global harmony. I \nfear that, in some instances, it is simply an effort to further a \npolitical or ideological agenda, because the record suggests that this \nsudden interest in foreign law is more ideological than legal; it seems \nselective, not principled.\n  U.S. courts are following foreign law, it seems, inconsistently--only \nwhen needed to achieve a particular outcome that a judge or justice \nhappens to desire but that is flatly inconsistent with U.S. law and \nprecedent. Many countries, for example, have no exclusionary rule to \nsuppress evidence that is otherwise useful and necessary in a criminal \ncase. Yet our courts have not abandoned the exclusionary rule in the \nUnited States, relying upon the greater wisdom and insight of foreign \ncourts and foreign nations. I might add that very few countries provide \nabortion on demand. Yet our courts have not abandoned our Nation's \nconstitutional jurisprudence on that subject. Four Justices of the \nSupreme Court believe that school choice programs that benefit poor \nurban communities are unconstitutional if parochial schools are \neligible, even though other countries directly fund religious schools.\n  Even more disconcerting than the distrust of our constitutional \ndemocracy is the distrust of America itself. I would hope that no \nAmerican--and certainly no judge--would ever believe that the citizens \nof foreign countries are always right and that America is always wrong. \nYet I worry that some judges become more and more interested in \nimpressing their peers in foreign judiciaries and foreign governments \nand less interested in simply following the U.S. Constitution and \nAmerican laws. At least one U.S. Supreme Court Justice mentioned \npublicly--and Justice Ginsburg's comments were reported on April 2 in \nthe New York Times. A Justice has stated that following foreign rulings \nrather than U.S. rulings ``may create that all important good \nimpression,'' and therefore, ``over time, we will rely increasingly . . \n. on international and foreign courts in examining domestic issues.''\n\n  Well, let me conclude by saying I find disturbing this attitude and \nthese expressions of support for foreign laws and treaties that we have \nnot ratified, particularly when they are used to interpret what the \nU.S. Constitution means. The brave men and women of our Armed Forces \nare putting their lives on the line in order to champion freedom and \ndemocracy, not just for the American people but for people all around \nthe world. America today is the world's leading champion of freedom and \ndemocracy. I raise this issue, and I have filed a resolution for the \nconsideration of my colleagues on this issue. I speak about it today at \nsome length because I believe this is an important matter for the \nAmerican people to know about and to have a chance to speak out on.\n  I believe the American people--certainly the people in Texas--do not \nwant their courts to make political decisions. They want their courts \nto follow and apply the law as written. I believe the American people \ndo not want their courts to follow the precedents of foreign courts. \nThey want their courts to follow U.S. laws and U.S. precedents. The \nAmerican people do not want their laws controlled by foreign \ngovernments. They want their laws controlled by the American \nGovernment, which serves the American people. The American people do \nnot want to see American law and American policy outsourced to foreign \ngovernments and foreign courts.\n  So I have submitted a resolution to give this body the opportunity to \nstate for the record that this trend in our courts is wrong and that \nAmerican law should never be reversed or rejected simply because a \nforeign government or a foreign court may disagree with it. This \nresolution is nearly identical to one that has been introduced by my \ncolleague in the House, Congressman Tom Feeney. I applaud his \nleadership and efforts in this area, and I hope both the House and \nSenate will come together and follow the footsteps of our Founding \nFathers, to once again defend our rights as Americans to dictate the \npolicies of our Government--informed but never dictated by the \npreferences of any foreign government or tribunal.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to pay my \nrespects to a simple, humble man who achieved historic greatness--Pope \nJohn Paul II. The Archbishop of Minneapolis-St. Paul, Harry Flynn, had \na\n\n[[Page S3129]]\n\nquote the other day. I was home this weekend with my wife and was \nlooking over remarks made about John Paul II. The Archbishop said this:\n\n       He will be known, I firmly believe, as John Paul the Great \n     in the long history of the church. This will be because of \n     his profound writings and for his unceasing focus on the \n     dignity of each and every human being and the paramount value \n     of human life. To my mind, his election to the pontificate \n     was made possible by the providence of God and demonstrates \n     God's love for his church.\n\n  I agree with my friend Archbishop Flynn that John Paul II will be \nknown in history as John Paul the Great.\n  The human family is plagued by many artificial divisions. Once in a \ngreat while, a figure emerges whose ideas and example resonate across \nall boundaries and brings us together. John Paul II was such a person.\n  As a Jew, I feel a deep sense of personal loss because the person I \nlooked to for leadership and who I deeply and profoundly respected has \npassed on. I have the image of John Paul II at the western wall in \nJerusalem, the Wailing Wall it has been called, the last remains of the \nouter part of the second temple, perhaps one of the holiest spots in \nthe Jewish faith. I believe, if my recollection of Jewish tradition is \ncorrect, as you walk along the western wall, about 100 yards inward is \nthe place where Abraham was going to sacrifice his son and the covenant \nwith God was formed. I remember John Paul there praying, inserting his \nprayer--one of the things you do at the western wall is oftentimes you \ntake a prayer and put it in one of the crevices of the wall as you say \na prayer.\n  His feeling was so deep and rich. I can see him there praying in \nfront of the western wall, I believe asking for forgiveness for the \nchurch for the history of antisemitism.\n  I have heard the essence of leadership described in this way: A \nleader maintains order in the midst of change and change in the midst \nof order. That was John Paul's outstanding gift. He held strongly to \neternal values while he was a force for dynamic and even revolutionary \nchange. He played a decisive role in the liberation of Eastern Europe \nand the fall of the Soviet Union. He has passed on within a few months \nof the other central figure in that historic change, Ronald Reagan. But \nPope John Paul II did not wield military power. He was a man whose \nstrength came from moral force and a conscience governed by peace.\n  Remarkably, he was able to lead with equal impact in the vigorous \nearly days of his papacy and in the weakness of his latter years.\n  There has been so much that has been written and said about this Pope \nin the last few days that I believe has captured the essence of this \ngreat man. There is a piece I saw in Larry Kudlow's column. I would \nlike to read from it:\n\n       John Paul II reached across all religious lines, becoming \n     the most evangelical pope in recent memory. He was tireless \n     as he spread his message of traditional religious faith and \n     values to anyone who would listen--believers, nonbelievers, \n     Catholics, Protestants, Muslims, Jews. This will surely be \n     one of his most enduring legacies. You do not have to be \n     Catholic to be grateful for the service John Paul II rendered \n     to all mankind.\n\n  He did a tremendous service by the way he reached out to Israel and \nJews around the world. His visits to Holocaust sites healed generations \nof misunderstanding and underscored the world's conviction that events \nsuch as this must never be allowed to happen again.\n  His constancy showed us how to live. His forgiveness showed us how to \ndeal with evil. His generosity showed us our obligation to the less \nfortunate. His faith showed us that we all live for purposes far beyond \nourselves.\n  I was the mayor of St. Paul, MN, so I am happy to quote St. Paul's \nwords to sum up the Holy Father's life:\n\n       Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does \n     not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-\n     seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of \n     wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the \n     truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, \n     always perseveres. Love never fails.\n\n  John Paul II was an ambassador of love, and his love will continue to \nbless the world. I said to my wife the other day: How blessed we are to \nhave lived in his time.\n  John Paul the Great is no longer physically with us, but he has \ntouched all our souls in extraordinary ways. We thank God to have known \nhim.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, a number of years ago, maybe 15 years ago, I \nhad the opportunity to read a biography of Pope John Paul II. It was a \nbig book given to me by a friend. I started reading it and I couldn't \nput it down. It read like a novel. He was a tremendously interesting, \nfascinating, wonderful human being I came to appreciate. I did not know \nmuch about the Pope, but after reading that book I tried to read \neverything I could about him.\n  The only personal situation I ever had involving the Pope was shortly \nafter I read that book I traveled to Central America with a \ncongressional delegation. This was during the time of the Iran contra \nconflict. One of the people we met was the Interior Minister of \nNicaragua, a Communist. I met him. He was a pleasant man. He was a \nCatholic priest.\n  He talked about the fact he had been to Nevada. He was a relief \npriest. He would relieve priests in rural Nevada for their vacations. \nHe talked about Battle Mountain where he had administered the last \nrites to a sheep herder. He was a very pleasant man. I learned later, \nhowever, about a story when the Pope had been through Nicaragua \nearlier. There was a long line of priests, as is traditional in the \nCatholic faith, that kiss the ring of the father, the Pope. When this \nman came by, the Pope withdrew his ring. He knew what this man had done \nin Nicaragua. He was a Communist, and he did not like what he had done, \nand he didn't kiss his ring; the Pope pulled it back.\n  Pope John was a man of conviction and very strong feelings. One of \nthe strongest convictions he had was about communism. He knew what it \nhad done to his country of birth.\n  He is exemplary of why the former Soviet Union could beat down \nreligion in every country it oppressed except Poland. It couldn't do \nit. And Pope John was an example of how the Poles reacted to communism. \nThey tried to shut the schools. The Catholic schools flourished during \nall the time of communism. They could not shut them down.\n  This weekend, the Catholic Church lost its spiritual leader and a \nspiritual leader of the world. Just because you are not of that faith \ndoes not take away from the spiritual power of this man. I acknowledge \nhis spiritual power. In the book I read, I learned it was not unusual \nfor Pope John Paul II to pray for 4 or 5 hours at a time. He was a man \nof great spirituality. Without any reservation, the world lost its \nspiritual leader and incredible role model. He displayed amazing \nstrength, courage, and compassion throughout his life, his life of \nservice to his fellow man.\n  As we know, he was born in Poland near Krakow. During his 84 years, \nhe had enormous impact on the people and politics of his time. His \nlifetime and acts are full of lessons for all of us. But as so often is \nthe case with life, you may not have guessed this from his early years. \nHe was also a gifted athlete and extremely smart. He spoke fluently \nseven languages. His favorite sport was soccer. He, in his adult life, \nwas an actor. He enjoyed acting. He wrote poetry. At the university he \nstudied literature and philosophy and still found time to take part in \nthe theater they had, becoming what many have called a gifted actor. \nThat is what they called him at the time. For a while, his ambition was \nto be a professional actor.\n  Pope John did not become part of the priesthood as a teenager. He was \nin his midtwenties before he became a priest. In the early 1940s, his \nlife led him to the priesthood and his ultimate calling. He was elected \nnot long thereafter to be head of the Catholic Church in 1978. For 27 \nyears he has changed lives and touched the world in countless\n\n[[Page S3130]]\n\nways. Some say he was too conservative. Some say he was not progressive \nenough. But he made his mark wherever he went.\n  I will remember the Pope for the strength he showed throughout his \nlife. It all started in reading the book about this great man. In the \nface of communism, he stood with the people of Eastern Europe and \nempowered them in their pursuit of freedom. In the face of hunger and \ndespair, he challenged powerful nations, including our own to do more \nto reach out and lift up our struggling neighbors. In the rush to war, \nhe sought peace always. At the end of his days when sickness had taken \nhis physical strength, he still showed grace and courage in tending to \nhis flock.\n  The last pictures we see of the Pope in some of our minds' eye, \nhaving gone through surgery, he was still standing in front of the \nthrong that came to see him, and still doing his very best to speak. He \ncouldn't speak. How frustrating that must have been.\n  There are many lessons we can draw from the life of Pope John Paul \nII. He traveled the globe more than any Pope in history. He was a skier \nin addition to being the Pope. He skied while he was the Pope.\n\n  He did not have to travel the world, but he did, realizing that he \nbrought the spotlight of media and attention to the cause of many who \notherwise would have been ignored.\n  He was shot by a would-be assassin. As soon as he was physically \nable, he went to the prison cell of the man who shot him and forgave \nhim in the prison cell in a one-on-one meeting with his would-be \nassassin.\n  We now know as a result of that assassin's attempt they developed a \nnew vehicle for him. In this age of terror, the Popemobile is something \nwe all understand. He waved to people from this little bulletproof \nvehicle which he rode around in like a golf cart. It was not a \nlimousine. It was the Popemobile.\n  He also reached out to leaders. He did not always agree with these \nleaders he reached out to, recognizing that problems are better solved \nby working together. In our own country, he reached out to former \nPresidents Carter, Reagan, Bush, and Clinton, and worked closely with \nour current President. He did not alienate or reject leaders who \ndisagreed with him. He sought common ground in championing the causes \nof his fellow man.\n  But ultimately, I believe the life of Pope John Paul II is a reminder \nthat one man or one woman can make a difference. It does not matter \nwhere we are born. It does not matter what we aspire to early in life. \nIt can change for the better. It does not matter what paths we have \nwandered. We all have the ability to rise up and help our fellow man in \nimmeasurable ways. There is no better example of that than Pope John \nPaul II.\n  As the world mourns the loss of the Pope, may we keep that lesson in \nmind, and find inspiration in his life and the work he has \naccomplished.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/04/senate-section/article/S3130-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3130-S3132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                    Master Sergeant Michael Hiester\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from \nBluffton. Master Sergeant Michael Hiester, 33 years old, was one of \nfour Indiana National Guardsmen who died on March 26 when a land mine \nexploded under their military vehicle south of Kabul. With his life \nbefore him, Michael risked everything to fight for the values Americans \nhold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  A devoted father of two young children, Michael served as a part-time \nfirefighter in his hometown of Bluffton, in addition to being a member \nof the Indiana National Guard. Like most things Michael set his mind \nto, he was successful in his military career. A full-time Guardsman \nsince 1990, Michael was promoted to master sergeant 3 months ago. He \nhad previously served his country in Bosnia-Herzegovina as part of the \nIndiana Guard's peacekeeping assignment. According to friends and \nfamily, Michael was also a real estate appraiser and an avid athlete \nwho loved diving and cycling. Mayor Ted Ellis shared memories of \nMichael with the Associated Press, saying, that he ``was just the kind \nof guy that every parent wants their child to be like--outgoing and \nhardworking and always thinking about something that they could do out \nthere for the community.'' I stand here today to express gratitude for \nMichael's sacrifices and for those made by the entire Hiester family on \nbehalf of our country.\n  Michael was killed while serving his country in Operation Enduring \nFreedom. He was a member of the Indiana National Guard's 76th Infantry \nBrigade. This brave young soldier leaves behind his wife Dawn, a 6-\nyear-old daughter, Emily, and a 4-year-old son, Adam.\n  Today, I join Michael's family, his friends and the entire Bluffton \ncommunity in mourning his death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow \nover this loss, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely \nfighting to make the world a safer place. It is his courage and \nstrength of character that people will remember when they think of \nMichael, a memory that will burn brightly during these continuing days \nof conflict and grief.\n  Michael was known for his dedication to family and his love of \ncountry. Today and always, Michael will be remembered by family \nmembers, friends and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero and we \nhonor the sacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Michael's sacrifice, \nI am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the \nfamilies of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we \ncannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living \nand dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor \npower to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember \nwhat we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This \nstatement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am \ncertain that the impact of Michael's actions will live on far longer \nthan any record of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Michael Hiester in the \nCongressional Record of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country \nand for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I \nthink about this just cause in which we are engaged, and the \nunfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that \nfamilies like Michael's can find comfort in the words of the prophet \nIsaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord \nGod will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Michael.\n\n\n                    Army Specialist Brett M. Hershey\n\n  Mr. President, I also wish to honor the life of a brave young man who \ngrew up in Indianapolis. Army SPC Brett M. Hershey, 23 years old, was \none of four Indiana National Guardsmen who died on March 26th when a \nland mine exploded under their military vehicle south of Kabul. With \nhis entire life before him, Brett risked everything to fight for the \nvalues Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the \nworld.\n  A 2000 graduate of North Central High School in Indianapolis, Brett \nwas just seven credits shy of graduating from Indiana University in \nBloomington, when he left for Afghanistan. Friends and teachers recount \nthat at North Central, Brett was a model student with an ever-present \nsmile, who was involved in religious groups, varsity lacrosse and \nstudent government. Brett's older brother, Nate, recalled his brother's \nvibrant spirit when speaking to the Indianapolis Star saying, Brett \n``loved people very well, and he loved them because his first love was \nJesus. He was funny, witty and passionate about just sucking the marrow \nout of life. He always wanted people to know they were loved.''\n  Brett was killed while serving his country in Operation Enduring \nFreedom. He was a member of the Indiana National Guard's 76th Infantry \nBrigade. This brave young soldier leaves\n\n[[Page S3131]]\n\nbehind his mother Roxanne; his father Roger; his sister Abby; his \nbrother Nathan; and his sister Nicole.\n  Today, I join Brett's family and friends in mourning his death. While \nwe struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride \nin the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Brett, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Brett was known for his deep faith, his dedication to his family, and \nhis love of country.

Fiscus\n\n  Mr. President, I honor the life of a brave young man from Milford. \nCaptain Michael ``Todd'' Fiscus, 36 years old, was one of four Indiana \nNational Guardsmen who died on March 26 when a land mine exploded under \ntheir military vehicle south of Kabul. With his entire life before him, \nTodd risked everything to fight for the values Americans hold close to \nour hearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  A devoted father of two daughters and a successful soldier, Todd \njoined the Indiana Air National Guard about 16 years ago before \nswitching to the Army National Guard. In joining the Guard, Todd \nfollowed a family tradition of service, as his father, Captain Mike \nFiscus, also serves in the Army Guard. Outside of his missions to \nAfghanistan and Bosnia-Herzegovina, Todd flew charter planes. His wife \nPaula shared memories of Todd with the Indianapolis Star, recounting \nthat ``he wanted to be out there making a difference.'' A neighbor told \na local television station, ``As a neighbor and friend--he was a \nwonderful, wonderful man--great father and a great husband.'' I stand \nhere today to express gratitude for Todd's sacrifices and for those \nmade by the entire Fiscus family on behalf of our country.\n  Todd was killed while serving his country in Operation Enduring \nFreedom. He was a member of the Indiana National Guard's 76th Infantry \nBrigade. This brave soldier leaves behind his wife Paula and his two \nyoung daughters: Alexandra, 5, and Gabrielle, 4.\n  Today, I join Todd's family, his friends and the entire Milford \ncommunity in mourning his death.

Army SPC Norman ``Kyle'' Snyder, 21 years old, was one of \nfour Indiana National Guardsmen who died on March 26 when a land mine \nexploded under their military vehicle south of Kabul. With his entire \nlife before him, Kyle risked everything to fight for the values \nAmericans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  After graduating from Sullivan High School, Kyle joined the National \nGuard, a dream he had long held. A country music fan with many friends, \nKyle had hoped to attend college in the coming fall. By joining the \nNational Guard, Kyle became a part of a longstanding family tradition \nof service, as most of his male relatives also served in the military. \nHis mother, Donna Shots, recalled her son's service to his country, \nsaying ``I am honored to know that my son served in the military, died \nhonorably and I can hold my head up knowing he was proud and so am I to \nbe an American.'' Today and always, Kyle will be remembered by family \nmembers, friends and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero and we \nhonor the sacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  Kyle was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. \nHe was a member of the Indiana National Guard's 76th Infantry Brigade. \nThis brave young soldier leaves behind his mother Donna Shots; his \nfather Jerry Snyder; his sister Shelli Snyder; his two half brothers, \nDerek Eugene Snyder and Craig Allen Snyder; and his grandparents, \nAzalia Barfield, Jane and Ron Moreland, Juanita Walters, and Norman and \nSusan Snyder.\n  Today, I join Kyle's family, his friends and the entire Carlisle \ncommunity in mourning his death.

IWAN\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to honor First \nLieutenant Edward D. Iwan of Albion, NE.\n  First Lieutenant Iwan was a man who led by example and his leadership \ndeserves the utmost honor. He was raised on a farm near Albion, NE and \nwas a 1994 graduate of Albion High School where he was active in Future \nFarmers of America and Student Council. First Lieutenant Iwan valued \nhis church, family, and country; and following high school he served 3 \nyears in the United States Army. He then returned to Nebraska and \nearned a Bachelor of Science degree in Criminal Justice. During college \nhe remained active in the Armed Forces including the ROTC, National \nGuard and Army Reserve. In December of 2001, First Lieutenant Iwan \nreturned full-time to the Army.\n  During his last tour of duty to our country this soldier was promoted \nfrom Second to First Lieutenant, served in several locations, and was \ndeployed to Iraq in January of 2004 with the 2nd Battalion, 2nd \nInfantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division. First Lieutenant Edward D. \nIwan was killed in action on Friday, November 12, 2004 during sustained \ncombat in Fallujuh, Iraq. This brave soldier led by example to the very \nend, when even as his unit was under attack, he continued to guide his \ntroops. He was killed when a rocket propelled grenade struck his \nBradley Fighting Vehicle. His final heroic moments resulted in the \nposthumous awards of a Purple Heart and Bronze Star.\n  I offer my sincere thoughts and prayers to the family and friends of \nFirst Lieutenant Iwan. His service to our Nation will forever be \nappreciated. He was an outstanding American, Nebraskan, and soldier who \nembodied the bravery, spirit, grace and values of our grateful Nation.\n\n\n                 MARINE LANCE CORPORAL SHANE E. KIELION\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to also honor Marine LCpl Shane E. \nKielion of La Vista, NE.\n  Lance Corporal Kielion, a young man with a bright future, heroically \nserved our Nation. As a 1999 graduate of South High School he attended \nPeru State College and was employed before deciding to enter the United \nStates Marine Corps in 2002. He wed his high school sweetheart, April, \nwhile being stationed in San Diego. Lance Corporal Kielion was assigned \n3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, 1 Marine \nExpeditionary Force, Marine Corps Base Camp in Pendleton, CA.\n  Lance Corporal Kielion died November 15, 2004, from injuries \nsustained from small arms fire as a result of enemy action. On that \nsame day, Lance Corporal Kielion's son was born. Shane Jr. is a living \nremembrance of his father who was a brave and dedicated son, brother, \nfriend, husband, and Marine.\n  I would like to extend my sympathy to all those who were blessed to \nknow Lance Corporal Kielion and remind them that he will always be \nremembered as a brave and dedicated U.S. marine. Loyal and honorable \nare two appropriate descriptions of LCpl Shane Kielion who will forever \nremain in the hearts and minds of those he left behind including his \nwife and son.\n\n\n                       Sergeant Nicholas S. Nolte\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor Marine SGT Nicholas S. Nolte of \nFalls City, NE.\n  As a 1998 graduate of Falls City Sacred Heart, Nicholas S. Nolte \ndemonstrated honor, dignity, and bravery in his decision to join the \nMarines after graduation. Sergeant Nolte was so dedicated to his \nservice that he reenlisted after his original 4-year commitment and was \nassigned to the 2nd Low Altitude Air Defense Battalion, 2nd Marine \nAircraft Wing, II Marine Expeditionary Force, Marine Corps Air Station, \nin Cherry Point, NC. He was also a member of the Presidential \nHelicopter Squadron HMX-1 where he honorably guarded and served \nPresident Clinton and President Bush.\n  On November 9, 2004 while serving in Iraq, Sergeant Nolte was injured \nas a result of enemy action when a roadside bomb hit his vehicle in Al \nAnbar Province, Iraq. He later died from his wounds on November 24th at \nthe National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, MD.\n  Sergeant Nolte left behind his wife Melina and daughter Alanna. He is \nsurvived by many family, friends, and countrymen who honor his bravery \nfor serving our Nation and fighting for our freedom.

Mr. President, it is with deep sadness that I learned this \npast week of the passing of a dear friend and former colleague, Senator \nHowell Heflin.\n  My thoughts and prayers today and those of my wife, Barbara, are with \nhis loving wife, Elizabeth Ann ``Mike'', and his family.\n  Everyone thought of Howell as ``Judge'' Heflin, even as he served in \nthe Senate, because he forever looked and acted the part of the \n``country judge''. He came to the Senate, as I did, in the class of \n1978. Howell was then already a distinguished jurist, having served 6 \nyears as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. He went on to \nbuild a solid reputation and to play an important role in the life of \nthe Senate over the next 18 years.\n  Howell Heflin, a man of not only intellect, but warmth and good-\nhumor, tackled some of the more thankless tasks in the Senate, \nincluding the arcane issues involving bankruptcy and administrative \npractice, and serving as the chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee in \nparticularly turbulent times. He could always be counted on to approach \ndifficult issues with careful thoughtful analysis, and to apply his \nbalanced judgement objectively. For this reason, and others, Howell \nHeflin was respected on both sides of the aisle. In fact, he frequently \nserved as a bridge between Democrats and Republicans in a way sorely \nneeded in today's Senate. He was a true moderate, moderate in politics \nand by temperament. His demeanor, his objectivity, as well as his \nexpertise, diligence and attention to the facts, have been missed and \nare among the very elements most needed now in this Chamber if we are \nto hope to remain the world's most deliberative body.\n  Senator Heflin served the people of Alabama, proudly. He served our \nnation with genuine dignity. And, today, as I look back on the life and \ncareer of Howell Heflin, I reflect on how proud I am of having had the \nopportunity to serve with this very special man, and to call him my \nfriend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/04/senate-section/article/S3132-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3132-S3133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate\n\n[[Page S3133]]\n\ncrimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate crimes \nlaw, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our \nsociety. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight \na separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  Last month, a 19-year-old gay man from New York was brutally \nmurdered. The victim's dismembered limbs were found throughout \nBrooklyn, including inside a subway tunnel.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Lautenberg in \nintroducing the Terrorist Apprehension Record Retention Act. I \ncosponsored the Terrorist Apprehension Record Retention Act because I \nbelieve it is commonsense legislation which will strengthen our \nhomeland security.\n  According to the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, anyone \nseeking to purchase or obtain a permit to possess, acquire, or carry \nfirearms must undergo a background check through the National Instant \nCriminal Background Check System, or NICS. This process requires the \napplicant to provide a variety of personal information including name, \ndate of birth, current residence, and country of citizenship which is \nthen compared with data in the NICS system to determine whether the \nperson is prohibited by law from receiving or possessing firearms. \nDisqualifying criteria include felony convictions and fugitive or \nillegal alien status. If no disqualifying information is found within 3 \nbusiness days, the transaction is allowed to continue.\n  As part of the background check, applicants are also checked against \nknown terrorist watch lists. However, under current law, membership in \na known terrorist organization does not automatically disqualify an \napplicant from receiving or possessing a firearm. In cases where a \npositive match is made, Federal authorities search for other \ndisqualifying information. If no disqualifying information can be found \nwithin 3 business days, the transaction is permitted to continue. In \naddition, all records pertaining to a positive match of an applicant to \na terrorist watch list must, under current law, be destroyed within 24 \nhours if no disqualifying information is found.\n  A report released by the General Accountability Office on March 8, \n2005, found that from February 3, 2004, through June 30, 2004, a total \nof 44 firearm purchase attempts were made by individuals designated as \nknown or suspected terrorists by the Federal Government. In 35 cases, \nthe transactions were authorized to proceed because Federal authorities \nwere unable to find any disqualifying information.\n  Federal Bureau of Investigation counterterrorism officials stated \n``receiving all available personal identifying information and other \ndetails from terrorism-related NICS transactions could be useful in \nconducting investigations.'' Currently, counterterrorism officials do \nnot have access to the majority of these records because they are \ndestroyed within 24 hours of the transaction in the absence of \ndisqualifying information.\n  The Terrorist Apprehension Record Retention Act addresses this issue \nby requiring that in cases where an NICS background check turns up a \nvalid match to a terrorist watch list, all records pertaining to the \ntransaction be retained for 10 years. In addition, the bill requires \nthat all NICS information be shared with appropriate Federal and State \ncounterterrorism officials anytime an individual on a terrorist watch \nlist attempts to buy a firearm. Learning about a suspected terrorist's \npurchase of a firearm could potentially be critical to counterterrorism \ninvestigators working to prevent a terrorist attack.\n  This bill takes a commonsense approach to assisting Federal \nauthorities in monitoring and apprehending suspected terrorists without \ncompromising the privacy rights of law-abiding citizens. I am hopeful \nthat the Congress will take up and pass this legislation to give \nFederal and State counterterrorism officials the information they need \nto help keep our families and communities safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/04/senate-section/article/S3133-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             AFRO-COLOMBIANS AND THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CBC\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Today I wish to commend Congressman Bobby Rush and other \nmembers of the Congressional Black Caucus for their work on behalf of \nAfro-Colombians. The consistent advocacy of the CBC on this human \nrights issue has been critical to increasing consciousness and activism \nin the U.S. and Colombia. Significant progress has made through this \nalliance, and I look forward to working with the CBC and other \ncommunity groups on this issue.\n  Throughout Latin America, Afro-Latino communities remain \nmarginalized--socially, economically and politically. In the case of \nColombia, the violence and disruption of the country's 40-year civil \nconflict have disproportionately affected Afro-Colombians. Many are now \nrefugees in their own country after being forced to leave their homes, \nand they face widespread racial discrimination as they try to rebuild \ntheir lives. Although Colombia's 1991 Constitution granted Afro-\nColombians territorial rights to the land they historically held, these \nrights are now being increasingly violated, as this land is taken from \nthem. With little or no economic and educational opportunities \navailable, many Afro-Colombian youths have turned to coca cultivation \nor joined guerrilla forces.\n  With the rise of Afro-Colombian advocacy groups and NGOs in Colombia, \nI believe it is possible to foster meaningful partnerships and \nalliances for positive change in this region. In addition to the CBC, \nthere are many members of the religious community--in my home State of \nIllinois and across our country--who are working on behalf of Afro-\nColombians. I commend them on their dedication to this important cause. \nTogether we can and will make a difference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/04/senate-section/article/S3133-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3133-S3137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        BUDGET ESTIMATE--S. 600\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.

The bill also contains provisions that \n     would raise the cost of discretionary programs for famine and \n     reconstruction assistance, debt relief, public diplomacy, \n     personnel, and other programs over the 2007-2010 period. CBO \n     estimates that those provisions and the indefinite \n     authorizations for 2007 would require appropriations of $34 \n     billion over those four years. CBO estimates that \n     implementing the bill would cost about $59 billion over the \n     2006-2010 period, assuming the appropriation of the necessary \n     amounts.\n\n[[Page S3134]]\n\n       CBO estimates that S. 600 would raise direct spending by \n     $33 million in 2006 and by $87 million over the 2006-2015 \n     period. S. 600 also would increase governmental receipts \n     (i.e., revenues) by an insignificant amount each year by \n     creating new criminal penalties related to law enforcement \n     and protective functions of State Department special agents \n     and guards. Finally, the Joint Committee on Taxation \n     estimates that the bill would lower revenues by less than \n     $500,000 a year by exempting employees of the U.S. Mission to \n     the United Nations in New York City from paying taxes on \n     their housing allowance.\n       S. 600 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \n     (UMRA) and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or \n     tribal governments.\n\n\n                estimated cost to the federal government\n\n       The estimated budgetary impact of S. 600 is shown in Table \n     1.

That act authorized the\n  appropriation of $15 billion for the 2004-2008 period for HIV/AIDS programs, including programs administered\n  by the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\\3\\ These amounts do not include costs for section 213 of the bill because CBO cannot estimate the timing or\n  amounts that may be necessary to implement those provisions.\n\\4\\ In addition to the effects shown for direct spending, CBO estimates that provisions that would increase or\n  decrease revenues would have a net effect of less than $500,000 each year over the 2006-2015 period.\n\n                           basis of estimate\n\n       The bill would authorize appropriations for the Department \n     of State and international broadcasting activities for fiscal \n     years 2006 and 2007. It would be the first comprehensive \n     foreign assistance authorization act since the mid-1980s--\n     authorizing funding for most existing assistance programs \n     and also several new ones. The bill also would raise \n     direct spending by $33 million in 2006 and by $87 million \n     over the 2006-2015 period. Finally, S. 600 would affect \n     governmental receipts (revenues), but CBO estimates that \n     the net effect would be less than $500,000 a year.\n     Spending Subject to Appropriation\n       S. 600 would authorize appropriations at the specified \n     level of $29.8 billion in 2006 and for such sums as may be \n     necessary for 2007 for the State Department, international \n     assistance programs, and related agencies. Of the 2006 \n     amount, nearly $0.6 billion would be for HIV/AIDS programs \n     that are currently authorized in existing law. The bill would \n     authorize new programs that would affect costs for \n     stabilization and reconstruction activities and assistance, \n     safe water, debt relief, public diplomacy, personnel, and \n     other programs. CBO estimates that implementing those \n     provisions would require additional appropriations of $0.7 \n     billion in 2006 and $4.4 billion over the 2007-2010 period. \n     For this estimate, CBO assumes that the authorized amounts \n     will be appropriated near the start of each fiscal year and \n     that outlays will follow historical spending patterns for the \n     existing and similar programs.\n       Specified Authorizations. The authorizations of \n     appropriations in this bill cover the operating expenses and \n     programs of the Department of State, the U.S. Agency for \n     International Development, the Broadcasting Board of \n     Governors (BBG), the Peace Corps, and the Millennium \n     Challenge Corporation. The authorization levels for 2006 are \n     equal to the President's request for international affairs \n     spending.\n       As shown in Table 2, S. 600 would authorize the \n     appropriation of $10.3 billion for international development \n     and humanitarian assistance programs--not counting HIV/AIDS \n     programs, $8.3 billion for international security assistance \n     programs, $9.2 billion for the State Department for programs \n     related to the administration of foreign affairs, \n     international organizations, and other associated programs, \n     $1.2 billion for international broadcasting and exchange \n     activities, and $0.1 billion for international commissions. \n     Except where otherwise discussed, CBO estimated \n     authorizations for 2007 at the amount specified in 2006 \n     adjusted for inflation.\n\n TABLE 2.--ESTIMATED AUTHORIZATIONS IN S. 600, THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS AUTHORIZATION ACT, FISCAL YEARS 2006 AND

The bill would authorize assistance to respond to \n     international crises through a new emergency fund and it \n     would establish an Office of Reconstruction and Stabilization \n     within the Department of State to provide civilian management \n     of stabilization and reconstruction efforts. The bill would \n     authorize the appropriation of $24 million in 2006 and \n     such sums as may be necessary in 2007 for personnel, \n     education and training, equipment, and travel costs. It \n     would authorize an initial appropriation of $100 million \n     for the emergency fund plus a permanent, indefinite \n     authorization of such sums as may be necessary to \n     replenish funds expended. In addition, it would authorize \n     the President to waive the percentage and aggregate dollar \n     limitations in current law regarding various authorities \n     to draw down or to transfer resources to respond to such \n     crises.\n       Office of Reconstruction and Stabilization. Section 706 \n     would authorize a new office within the Department of State \n     with responsibility to monitor and assess international \n     crises, to prepare contingency plans for various types of \n     crises, to identify and train personnel with necessary skills \n     for stabilization and reconstruction operations, and to \n     coordinate the U.S. efforts should the President decide to \n     respond to any crisis. The Office of Reconstruction and \n     Stabilization was created in August 2004.\n       The bill also would authorize the establishment of a \n     response readiness corps with up to 250 members to staff the \n     office and for deployment on short notice, plus a readiness \n     reserve from current federal employees and up to 500 \n     nonfederal personnel to support operations if needed. The \n     costs of activating the corps would be paid from the \n     emergency fund. Based on information from the State \n     Department, CBO estimates that annual costs associated with \n     the office and the response readiness corps would be $24 \n     million, adjusted annually for inflation.\n       Emergency Fund. Section 705 would authorize $100 million \n     for an emergency stabilization and reconstruction fund. \n     Considering the number of regions in the world in conflict or \n     recovering from conflict and that appropriations for the \n     reconstruction of Iraq and Afghanistan have totaled nearly \n     $24 billion over the 2003-2005 period, reconstruction could \n     require much larger funding levels than the amount \n     authorized. CBO estimates that the emergency fund would be \n     used for an initial response to an international crisis and \n     not for major reconstruction efforts which are discussed \n     below. For this estimate, CBO assumes that the fund would be \n     replenished--through discretionary appropriations--on an \n     annual basis at the $100 million level, adjusted for \n     inflation, and that it would be used for a mix of activities \n     with an aggregate spending pattern similar to the Economic \n     Support Fund.\n     Famine and Reconstruction Assistance\n       Section 2205 would expand the purposes for which \n     appropriations for international disaster assistance may be \n     provided to include programs of famine relief and \n     reconstruction following manmade or natural disasters abroad. \n     The bill would authorize the appropriation of $656 million in \n     2006 for international disaster and famine assistance, but \n     not reconstruction. Reconstruction following manmade or \n     natural disasters can be very expensive and has often been \n     funded by supplemental appropriations.\n       This year the President is requesting supplemental \n     appropriations of $0.7 billion for tsunami relief and \n     reconstruction and nearly $2.0 billion for Afghanistan. Those \n     amounts are in addition to $100 million enacted for Central \n     America and the Caribbean to recover after disastrous \n     hurricanes last fall. While it is impossible to estimate \n     future funding levels on an annual basis, CBO estimates that \n     meeting the expanded purposes could require appropriations of \n     several hundred million dollars to one billion dollars above \n     the level specified by the bill for countries emerging from \n     natural disasters, conflict, or civil strife. For this \n     estimate, based on historical funding for similar activities, \n     CBO assumes the costs for implementing this section would \n     total about $500 million each year over the 2006-2010 period, \n     assuming the appropriation of the necessary funds. Spending \n     of such funding would likely occur over a period of years so \n     that annual outlays would start well below that level, and \n     grow gradually.\n     Safe Water\n       Title XXVI would authorize the President to furnish \n     assistance to improve the safety of water supplies in \n     developing countries, to expand access to safe water and \n     sanitation, and to promote sound water management. In \n     addition to grant assistance to local governments and \n     nongovernmental organizations, it would authorize the \n     President to create a pilot program with the authority to \n     issue investment insurance, investment guarantees, and loan \n     guarantees; to provide direct investment or investment \n     encouragement; and to carry out special projects and programs \n     for eligible investors to assist in the development of safe \n     drinking water and sanitation infrastructure. It would \n     authorize the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary \n     over the 2006-2011 period to carry out the title.\n       The bill would, to the extent provided for in advance in \n     appropriation acts, authorize the President to create such \n     legal mechanisms as may be necessary for implementing the \n     authorities under the pilot program and to deem such legal \n     mechanisms to be nonfederal borrowers for purposes of the \n     Federal Credit Reform Act. It would, notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, authorize the President to provide \n     assistance under the pilot program in the form of partial \n     loan guarantees of up to 75 percent of the total amount of \n     the loan.\n       It is unclear whether the pilot program would be entirely \n     new or would be an augmentation of the existing credit \n     programs of the U.S. Agency for International Development and \n     Overseas Private Investment Corporation. It is also unclear \n     whether this new program would create federal or nonfederal \n     entities (legal mechanisms) or whether credit reform \n     treatment would apply. However, it is clear that the bill \n     would intend that resources devoted to providing safe water \n     be increased. For the purpose of the estimate, CBO assumes \n     the bill would double the assistance for safe water provided \n     to Sub-Saharan Africa in 2004, or an increase in 2006 of $50 \n     million over the amounts otherwise authorized in the bill, \n     and that amount would increase over the next five years to \n     $470 million, or the amount spent in 2004 for water programs \n     including those in Iraq. Because the cost recovery of water \n     investments projects would be in local currencies, CBO \n     assumes that investments relying on hard-currency credits \n     would remain unattractive and would be little used.\n     Debt Relief for the Poorest\n       Section 2114 would authorize the appropriation of $100 \n     million in 2006 for the cost, as defined by the Federal \n     Credit Reform Act, of restructuring bilateral debts, for debt \n     relief under the Tropical Forest Conservation Initiative, and \n     for a contribution to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries \n     Trust Fund administered by the World Bank. In addition, \n     section 2221 would authorize the President to reduce the U.S. \n     bilateral debt of low-income countries as part of \n     multilateral debt-relief agreements, commonly referred to as \n     the Paris Club, limited to such extent or in such amounts as \n     may be provided in advance in an appropriation act. That \n     authorization is the same as the authorization contained in \n     general provisions of annual appropriation acts for nearly a \n     decade.\n       The U.S. government has forgiven the bilateral debt that it \n     once held for most of the world's poorest countries; however, \n     it still holds the debt of some of the world's poorest \n     countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \n     Afghanistan, Sudan, Somalia, and Liberia. Congo has been \n     offered multilateral debt relief by the Paris Club. At some \n     point after 2006, the other poor countries may meet the \n     minimum requirements for multilateral debt relief as \n     stipulated by the bill. We cannot project the exact timing of \n     such action, but given the experience of other countries \n     emerging from internal conflict, we estimate that it would \n     take at least two to three years after a reconstituted \n     civilian government is established in those countries before \n     any multilateral debt agreement would be negotiated. While \n     the bill does not specifically authorize the appropriation of \n     any funds, CBO estimates that the present value of all debt \n     of low-income countries held by the U.S. government to be \n     between $550 million and $600 million. CBO estimates\n\n[[Page S3136]]\n\n     that forgiving bilateral loans to Congo would cost about $235 \n     million in 2007, an increase of $155 million over the amount \n     authorized for 2006. CBO estimates that forgiving the \n     bilateral loans to other poor countries would cost about $75 \n     million a year over the 2008-2010 period, assuming \n     appropriation of the necessary amounts.\n     Office Building for American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)\n       Section 211 would amend current law to authorize such sums \n     as may be necessary for the construction of a new office \n     building for the AIT in Taipei, Taiwan. Public Law 106-212 \n     authorized the appropriation of $75 million for the facility \n     without fiscal year limitation. According to the Department \n     of State, the projected cost of the building is now $153 \n     million, and roughly $20 million has been spent on site \n     acquisition and design. CBO estimates a net increase in \n     authorization of $78 million and assumes that construction \n     would begin in 2007 and end in 2010.\n     Personnel Benefits\n       S. 600 contains several provisions that would provide \n     benefits to State Department personnel that would increase \n     costs by up to $10 million each year, assuming the \n     appropriation of the necessary funds.\n       Hardship and Danger Pay Allowances. Section 303 would \n     increase the cap on hardship allowances and danger pay \n     allowances from 25 percent to 35 percent of basic pay for \n     employees serving overseas. Based on information from the \n     Department of State, CBO estimates implementing this section \n     would cost about $6 million a year, assuming the \n     appropriation of the necessary funds.\n       Educational Expenses of Dependent Children. Section 301 \n     would authorize payments for certain educational expenses of \n     dependent children of Foreign Service employees posted \n     overseas. Section 506 would allow the BBG to pay for the \n     educational expenses of certain dependents of employees in \n     the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Based on \n     information from the Department of State and the BBG, CBO \n     estimates implementing these provisions would cost about $3 \n     million annually.\n       Housing for Employees. Section 318 would allow the \n     department to provide housing to 10 more employees of the \n     U.S. Mission to the United Nations in New York City. Based on \n     information from the State Department, CBO estimates the \n     additional housing would cost between $500,000 and $1 million \n     a year, assuming the availability of appropriated funds.\n     Indefinite Authorizations for Currency Fluctuations\n       Section 102(c) would authorize the appropriation of such \n     sums as may be necessary in 2006 and 2007 to compensate for \n     adverse fluctuations in exchange rates that might affect \n     contributions to international organizations. Any funds \n     appropriated for this purpose would be obligated and expended \n     subject to certification by the Office of Management and \n     Budget. CBO estimates that the dollar will decline rougly 2 \n     percent in 2006 and that the Department of State would \n     require an additional $8 million that year to fully pay \n     assessed contributions to international organizations. \n     Currency fluctuations over the longer term are extremely \n     difficult to project, and they could result in spending \n     either higher or lower than the amounts specifically \n     authorized in the bill for contributions to international \n     organizations and programs. Therefore, this estimate assumes \n     no additional currency fluctuations in 2007.\n     Miscellaneous Provisions\n       S. 600 would authorize several new or expanded programs. In \n     general, the bill would fund these programs through earmarks \n     of funds otherwise authorized or the provisions would have an \n     insignificant impact on spending subject to appropriation, \n     CBO estimates.\n       Section 213 would create a Victims of Crime Office within \n     the Department of State and authorize the department to \n     provide services and financial assistance from its emergency \n     fund to U.S. nationals who become crime victims overseas. CBO \n     cannot estimate the budgetary impact of this provision given \n     the uncertainties associated with estimating how many \n     individuals may be victimized and whether victims of \n     terrorist acts would also be covered under this provision.\n       Title XXIII would authorize assistance to reduce the threat \n     to diplomatic missions abroad from an attack using \n     radioactive materials. In particular, it would authorize \n     assistance to foreign countries to develop appropriate \n     response plans and to train foreign personnel who would be \n     the first to respond to such an attack. The bill would \n     earmark $2 million from the amount authorized elsewhere in \n     the bill for Nonproliferation, Anti-Terrorism, Demining \n     and Related (NADR) programs to fund these activities.\n       Title XXIV would authorize a program of global pathogen \n     surveillance to assist in the monitoring and response to \n     bioterrorism and outbreaks of infectious disease. The bill \n     would earmark $35 million from the amount authorized for NADR \n     to fund these activities.\n       Title XXVIII would authorize a program for safeguarding and \n     eliminating man-portable air-defense systems and other \n     conventional arms. It would earmark $20 million from amounts \n     otherwise authorized in the bill.\n       Section 2224 would authorize the Secretary to designate a \n     nonprofit organization as the Middle East Foundation and to \n     fund the organization through grants. While the provision is \n     silent on the level of funding, the President is requesting \n     $25 million for the foundation.\n       Section 2211 would authorize appropriations for educating \n     children in Afghanistan about the dangers of land mines.\n       The bill includes numerous provisions that would expand or \n     introduce new reporting requirements and other provisions \n     that would eliminate or consolidate existing reporting \n     requirements.\n     Direct Spending and Revenues\n       CBO estimates that S. 600 would raise direct spending by \n     $33 million in 2006 and by $87 million over the 2006-2015 \n     period (see Table 3). The bill also contains provisions that \n     would increase and decrease governmental receipts (revenues), \n     but CBO estimates that the net effect of these provisions \n     would be less than $500,000 a year.\n\n TABLE 3.

Under current law, the \n     Secretary of State may transfer any current funds in excess \n     of needs that result from an increase in the purchasing power \n     of the dollar from accounts under ``Administration of Foreign \n     Affairs'' to the Buying Power Maintenance Account. The funds \n     in the account are available for transfer back to those \n     accounts only to offset future adverse fluctuations in \n     exchange rates or overseas wage or price levels. The \n     Secretary may also transfer unavailable balances into the \n     Buying Power Maintenance Account, but only to the extent and \n     in such amounts as specifically provided in advance in \n     appropriation acts. No appropriation act has ever provided \n     that authority. Section 207 of the bill would strike the \n     requirement for appropriation action, thus allowing the \n     Secretary to transfer lapsed funds into the Buying Power \n     Maintenance Account and making them available to offset \n     future adverse currency fluctuations.\n       According to the Treasury Combined Statement on Receipts, \n     Outlays, and Balances, 2004, the Department of State had $80 \n     million in unobligated, unavailable balances in various \n     accounts in the Administration of Foreign Affairs bureau at \n     the start of 2005. Under the bill, such balances could be \n     transferred into the Buying Power Maintenance account upon \n     enactment and made available to meet adverse exchange rate \n     fluctuations. In addition, CBO estimates approximately 0.5 \n     percent of obligated balances, or about $20 million, would be \n     deobligated each year and reappropriated under the bill. \n     Because we estimate the dollar will decline in value over the \n     next year, we estimate that about half of the funds would be \n     transferred out of the Buying Power Maintenance Account and \n     spent. In total, we estimate direct spending of about $80 \n     million over the 2006-2015 period.\n     Medical Reimbursements\n       Section 206 would provide the State Department greater \n     flexibility in retaining reimbursements for funding medical \n     care provided to employees and eligible family members \n     overseas. Based on information from the department, CBO \n     estimates that it would collect and spend between $500,000 \n     and $1 million a year.\n     Other Provisions\n       CBO estimates that several provisions in the bill would \n     affect direct spending and revenues by less than $500,000 \n     annually.\n       Section 318 would exempt, for federal income tax purposes, \n     housing allowances paid to employees of the U.S. Mission to \n     the United Nations in New York City. The Joint Committee on \n     Taxation estimates that the provision would reduce tax \n     receipts by less than $500,000 each year, assuming it would \n     be effective for allowances paid on or after October 1, 2005.\n       Sections 201 and 203 would raise governmental receipts \n     (revenues) by establishing new criminal penalties that would \n     be assessed against persons interfering with the law \n     enforcement and protective functions of State Department \n     special agents and guards. CBO estimates that the increase in \n     revenues would not be significant in any year. Collections of \n     criminal fines are deposited in the Crime Victims Fund and \n     are later spent. CBO estimates that the criminal penalties\n\n[[Page S3137]]\n\n     that would be established under the bill would increase \n     direct spending from the Crime Victims Fund by less than \n     $500,000 per year.\n       Section 205 would allow the State Department's \n     International Litigation Fund to retain awards of costs and \n     attorneys' fees as a result of a decision by an international \n     tribunal. Based on information from the department, CBO \n     estimates that the Department of State would collect and \n     spend less than $500,000 a year.\n       Section 214 would authorize the Secretary to provide museum \n     visitor and educational outreach services and to sell, trade, \n     or transfer documents and articles that are displayed at the \n     United States Diplomacy Center. Any proceeds generated from \n     these services or sales would be retained and spent by the \n     center, and CBO estimates that this provision would have an \n     insignificant net effect on direct spending.\n       Several sections in title III of the bill would amend \n     retirement benefits for State Department personnel by \n     slightly broadening the authority of the department to \n     temporarily rehire Foreign Service retirees without \n     terminating their pension benefits; changing personnel review \n     and termination procedures for each Foreign Service class; \n     establishing a 60-day deadline for the Office of Personnel \n     Management to issue regulations in accordance with a \n     previously enacted change in pension benefits for certain \n     spouses of Foreign Service workers; and allowing employees of \n     Office of Coordination for Reconstruction and Stabilization \n     to continue collecting full retirement annuities provided by \n     the Foreign Service retirement system. Under current law, \n     Foreign Service retirement benefits are temporarily suspended \n     during any period of reemployment by the federal government. \n     CBO estimates that enacting the provisions would increase \n     direct spending by less than $500,000 annually over the 2005-\n     2015 period.\n       Section 2207 would authorize the President to waive the \n     requirement that a foreign government pay to the United \n     States the net proceeds from the sale of any military \n     equipment it has received from the United States on a grant \n     basis. CBO estimates the forgone offsetting receipts would \n     not be significant.\n\n\n              INTERGOVERNMENTAL AND PRIVATE-SECTOR IMPACT\n\n       S. 600 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates as defined in UMRA and would not affect the budgets \n     of state, local, or tribal governments.\n     Estimate Prepared By:\n       Federal Costs--State Department: Sunita D'Monte; Foreign \n     Aid: Joseph C.

Mr. President, a Federal budget is about setting \npriorities, and the priorities contained in this budget are all wrong.\n  About a year ago, Tom Friedman of the New York Times, described the \nPresident's budget as ``faith-based.'' Faith-based tax cuts were going \nto generate faith-based revenues, and we were all going to be better \noff. Well, the deficit is skyrocketing, interest rates are going up, \nand additional revenues haven't magically appeared.\n  If the budget before us were to pass unchanged, the deficit would \nincrease each and every year for the foreseeable future. Vermonters \nunderstand that this is a burden we don't want to pass on to our \ngrandchildren. We have fallen into a borrowing pattern that makes this \nYankee cringe.\n  But let me emphasize that the deficits that we are now facing are \nprimarily caused by a drop in revenues, not by wasteful spending on \nsuch things as education, veterans' benefits, and Amtrak. We could \neliminate all of the Federal Government's discretionary spending \noutside of defense and we would still have a deficit.\n  On the mandatory side of the budget, I agree that we need to get a \nhandle on increases in Medicaid spending and the pressures on Social \nSecurity due to the aging baby boom generation. But this budget fails \nto confront these challenges and in the case of Social Security \npretends there is no problem.\n  How can we pass a budget that ignores the cost of the Iraq War after \nSeptember 30? How can we pass a budget that includes more tax cuts for \nthe few, but doesn't budget for the reform of the alternative minimum \ntax or the President's own Social Security proposal?\n  How can we pass a budget that forces us to ``pay for'' any increases \nin programs for our neediest citizens but doesn't require us to ``pay \nfor'' tax cuts for the well-to-do? If we are to reinstate the pay-as-\nyou-go rule, then it should, as it always has, include paying for both \nnew spending and new tax cuts.\n  Speaking of tax cuts, I have grown very tired of the economic \ndoublespeak now in fashion. If tax cuts were the policy of choice when \nwe had large surpluses, and they are still the policy of choice when we \nnow have large deficits, when if ever are tax cuts not the appropriate \npolicy? Perhaps the families in Vermont who used up their heating \nassistance funds before winter was over, or the veteran on a waiting \nlist for a medical procedure at a VA hospital, would prefer an increase \nin government spending to a tax cut.\n  Priorities, it is all about priorities.\n  We are 2 years into a war. American service men and women continue to \ncome home with horrific wounds, both physical and mental. While the \nDepartment of Defense is keeping wounded soldiers in its medical system \nfor longer periods of time and is shouldering a greater share of the \ncosts, the long-term costs of health care and rehabilitation still fall \nheaviest on the Veterans Administration.\n  This budget responds by underfunding the VA by almost $16 billion \nover the next 5 years. How can we do this in the midst of a war? How \ncan the President in good conscience insist on maintaining large \nnumbers of troops in Iraq, and yet refuse to provide for the health \ncare needs of veterans? This is unacceptable.\n  This budget drastically cuts the Community Development Block Grant, \nCDBG, program and other programs that our communities rely on. These \nprograms now benefit so many Vermonters who struggle to make ends meet. \nThis budget would consolidate 18 programs, including the CDBG, and \nslashes their funding by 34 percent. In Vermont, this budget would most \nharshly affect middle and low-income citizens by making safe and \naffordable housing unattainable, ending quality childcare programs, and \ncompromising nutrition assistance. Funding for these important economic \ndevelopment programs must be restored.\n  I am very concerned that agriculture, conservation, and food \nassistance programs are faced with drastic cuts in funding. The Milk \nIncome Loss Contract Program, MILC, which the President saw fit to \ninclude in his proposed budget, has been left out of this budget \nresolution. The MILC Program is necessary to help family farmers \nthrough tough times when milk prices are low.\n\n[[Page S3138]]\n\n  This budget would also seriously compromise conservation programs \nthat are used to restore our land and clean our water. Perhaps most \nunsettling will be the cuts to food assistance and nutrition programs, \nincluding food stamps. In Vermont, 30 percent of children live in low-\nincome households that depend on food stamps for their basic needs and \nthe medical safety net for their healthcare.\n  Vermont, together with States throughout the Nation, is facing a \nserious budget shortfall in providing the most basic level of \nhealthcare to our most vulnerable citizens. Instead of facing that fact \nand providing temporary fiscal assistance to the States, the President \ncalled for billions of dollars in cuts in the Medicaid program, which \nthe Senate fortunately rejected.\n  I am most disappointed that the Senate did not vote to provide \nadditional funding for the Nation's water infrastructure. Spending on \nenvironmental programs from the national parks to programs that keep \nour water, land, and air clean will have to be reduced if this budget \nis enacted.\n  Priorities, it is all about priorities.\n  Even though education amendments passed, which I supported, that \nadded money back to the Senate budget proposal, that is still \ninsufficient to adequately fund important Federal education \ninitiatives. I remain concerned that the budget resolution will \neliminate funding for several key education programs, such as the $1.3 \nbillion Perkins Career and Technical Education Act. This is especially \ndepressing since just last week the Senate, on a vote of 99-0, passed \nthe Perkins bill. Then just a few days later, no funding is provided in \nthe budget to carry out the program that was just passed.\n  In addition, the budget proposal does not provide the meaningful \nincreases necessary to carry out the 4-year-old No Child Left Behind \nAct and the updated IDEA law that was enacted last December.\n  President Bush often mentions that education is a priority. He and I \nobviously define priority differently. To me, priority means you pay \nfor the promises you make. I do not believe priority means you sign \nlaws requiring more accountability to improve student performance, and \nthen, in the next breath, send up a budget that doesn't provide the \ndollars needed to carry out the purposes of those laws.\n  I have spent a substantial part of my career calling for the full \nfunding of special education. When the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act was enacted in 1975, Congress promised to pay 40 percent \nof the cost. In the current fiscal year, Congress will finance only 19 \npercent of the program, forcing States and localities to make up the \ndifference.\n  I have tried to fulfill this promise in each of the last few years by \nmaking IDEA funding mandatory. The President and his allies have said \nthat mandatory funding is not necessary, that we can meet the promise \nof IDEA by increasing funding by $1 billion each year. In this budget, \nIDEA funding is increased by only half of that amount.\n  This budget tells our children, their parents, and our local \ntaxpayers that they are not a priority, and that we will not keep our \nword.\n  There is no question we are living through difficult budgetary times \nand savings must be sought at every opportunity. But we must not delude \nthe American people into thinking that we can cut taxes, fight wars \noverseas, improve education, take care of our environment, and repair \nthe Nation's transportation and water infrastructure all at the same \ntime.\n  I could not support the budget resolution because it did not \nadequately fund important domestic programs and promote tax cuts to the \ndetriment of other priorities. At the same time, it did little to put \nour Nation's fiscal house in order.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/04/senate-section/article/S3138-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO AMERICA'S HEROES OF THE STORM\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON.

Mr. President, I would like to extend my best \nwishes to Carol DiBattiste, whose last day as deputy administrator of \nthe Transportation Security Administration was April 8, 2005. Carol \nDiBattiste is truly a living textbook version of a ``public servant.'' \nHer record is one of service to country, of a strong leader who gives \nunstintingly of herself to make sure that America's defenses against \nterrorism are as strong as possible. I know that Carol's dedication to \nthis mission and strong leadership will be sorely missed by her \ncolleagues at TSA and the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Ms. DiBattiste arrived at TSA in March of 2003 after more than 33 \nyears of public service and two years at a private law firm. As the new \nChief of Staff at TSA, she brought with her a sense of urgency that fit \nwell in an agency committed to the security of the Nation's \ntransportation system. Ms. DiBattiste immediately put her unique \nexperience and skills to work as a member of the TSA leadership team as \nit rushed to meet its mission.\n  Hard work has characterized Ms. DiBattiste's public career. She \nenlisted in the Air Force in 1971, earned her B.A. degree magna cum \nlaude in sociology/criminal justice from LaSalle University in 1976, \nher J.D. degree from Temple University School of Law in 1981, and her \nMaster of Laws degree from Columbia University School of Law in 1986.\n  Before retiring from the Air Force as a major in 1991, her \nassignments included serving as chief prosecutor for the Pacific \nRegion, faculty of the Air Force Judge Advocate General School, and \nchief recruiting attorney for the Air Force. Going forward, Ms. \nDiBattiste's career took her to the Department of Justice where she was \nan Assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District of \nFlorida and director of the Department's Office of Legal Education. In \n1993, Ms.\n\n[[Page S3139]]\n\nDiBattiste served with the Department of the Navy, where she was \nprincipal deputy general counsel, the service's second-highest ranking \nlawyer. In that role, she was responsible for resolving several high-\nprofile matters, including the sexual harassment scandal dubbed \n``Tailhook'' and the U.S. Naval Academy cheating case.\n  In 1994, Ms. DiBattiste returned to the Department of Justice as the \ndirector of the Executive Office for United States Attorneys. In that \ncapacity, she was instrumental in investigating the Oklahoma City \nBombing, Unabomber, Olympic Park Bombing and TWA 800 airliner crash. \nBetween 1997 and 1999, she served with distinction as Deputy United \nStates Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. In 1999, Ms. \nDiBattiste accepted the nomination of former President Clinton and \nserved as Under Secretary of the Air Force where, among other duties, \nshe chaired a task force that brokered an anti-harassment action plan \nfor the Department of Defense. Prior to joining TSA, Ms. DiBattiste was \na partner at Holland & Knight LLP, where her practice areas involved \ncorporate diversity counseling, government relations, and criminal and \ncivil litigation.\n  Last July, TSA Chief of Staff DiBattiste became Deputy Administrator \nDiBattiste, a move that again recognized her many talents and \nleadership abilities. Deputy Administrator DiBattiste and Administrator \nDavid Stone have spearheaded the efforts to make TSA a strong and \nmature performance based Federal agency. But even more importantly, Ms. \nDiBattiste made it her mission at TSA to continuously recruit new \nleaders and make sure that every TSA employee--from the screeners to \nthe executive team--understood their role in securing our Nation. \nFinally, Carol made sure that each of those employees understood that: \nthey were valued, their opinions mattered, and that what they were \ndoing was important, even vital to achieving TSA's mission. For that, \nwe all owe Deputy Administrator DiBattiste a great deal of gratitude.\n  It is instructive to read what some of her friends and colleagues at \nTSA have to say about Ms. DiBattiste. From Tom Blank, the Chief Support \nSystems Officer: ``Many times the sky was actually falling and when it \nwas, Carol was in charge of getting it put back up there again--all the \nwhile with the greatest sense of humor there is.'' From Theresa \nBertucci, Assistant Administrator for Intermodal Programs: ``She always \npushed the entire organization towards a level of excellence and \ncommitment, and never asked more of any person that worked alongside \nher than she asked of herself.'' And addressing Ms. DiBattiste, Tammy \nM. Meckley, Deputy Assistant Administrator for Transportation Security \nPolicy, said: ``Leadership is what every employee craves, thanks for \nkeeping all of us well fed.''\n  In an interview with TSA's newsletter, the Sentinel, Ms. DiBattiste \nsaid of the agency's efforts, ``Without question, America is safer \nsince the stand-up of TSA, and TSA has done an excellent job of \nprotecting the homeland. . . .'' Then typically, she added that ``there \nis a lot more to do.''\n  Mr. President, I realize we have much to accomplish here in the \nUnited States Senate, but I felt it was important that we thank this \ngreat American. I wish to congratulate Deputy Administrator Carol \nDiBattiste on a distinguished and selfless career; and in closing, \noffer the thought that the nation would be well-served if sometime in \nthe future she once again rejoined the ranks of public servant.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/04/senate-section/article/S3139-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORABLE PETER B. TEETS\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President I rise today to honor a \ndistinguished American and patriot the Honorable Peter B. Teets, former \nActing Secretary of the Air Force and Under Secretary of the Air Force.\n  Secretary Teets left government service on March 25, 2005 to join his \nfamily in Colorado. He did so after four years of selfless devotion to \nhis country serving in what I would characterize as four of the most \nimportant jobs within the Department of Defense--as the senior official \nin the Department of the Air Force responsible for nearly 700,000 \nmilitary, civilians, and family members with budget authority exceeding \n$110 billion dollars. Simultaneously, Mr. Teets also served as the \nDepartment of Defense Executive Agent for Space and as the Director of \nthe National Reconnaissance Office. In this later special capacity he \nwas responsible for the acquisition and operation of all space-based \nreconnaissance and intelligence systems. I think you would agree Mr. \nPresident, Pete Teets was an extraordinary public servant possessing \nuncompromising standards, superior managerial skills and a keen \nanalytical mind wherein he was able to exact the most from the military \nservice he represented and the programs he supervised. His quest for \nperfection across the board will long be remembered both within and \noutside the Department.\n  Prior to joining the Department of Defense, Pete Teets worked in \nindustry for nearly four decades serving first as a Martin Maretta \nflight control engineer and ending that service as the President and \nChief Operating Officer, Lockheed Martin Corporation. His resume is \nreplete with ever increasing positions of responsibility spanning the \nperiod 1963 to 2001, when he was nominated to serve President Bush as \nour Under Secretary of the Air Force and Director of the National \nReconnaissance Office, two demanding tasks particularly during this \ntime of transformation within the Department of Defense, coupled with \nthe challenges associated with emerging space requirements and system \ndevelopment.\n  Throughout his tenure, the members of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee have found Pete Teets to be one of the most thoughtful and \ninsightful DOD officials we have come to know. His ability to reduce \ncomplex system assessments into meaningful constructs were, on more \nthan one occasion, immensely helpful to every committee member. His \nprivate counsel and immense personal interaction were directly \nresponsible for solving major program problems for which our country is \nmost grateful.\n  Our Nation deserves no less than the full measure of devotion from \nthe men and women it nominates to our highest positions of authority. \nPeter Teets fulfilled every expectation the Congress and the nation \nplaced upon him. He did so with a combination of grace and dignity, \nsuperb organizational and managerial skill, and with that rare coupling \nof professionalism and confidence that his Air Force and our Department \nof Defense would not accept anything short of excellence in \naccomplishing every assigned mission and task.\n  I truly hope this is not the last time the nation will call upon \nPeter Teets and his family to serve this grateful Nation. Indeed, Pete \nhas earned the right to return home and focus on the one thing all of \nus yearn to do--spend time and focus on family. His many friends in the \nSenate wish him and his family all the best in the days ahead. We bid \nPete a fond farewell and heartfelt thanks for a magnificent job as our \nActing Air Force Secretary and as our Under Secretary of the Air Force. \nWe are a better people and stronger Nation today because Pete Teets \ngave and accomplished so much. We will indeed miss America's ``Mr. \nMilitary Space'' and wish him God's everlasting blessings.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/04/senate-section/article/S3139-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3139-S3140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING CAMERON TROOST\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the courage \nand sacrifice of Cameron S. Troost, a 10-year-old boy from South Bend, \nIN. Cameron suffers from pediatric bipolar disorder, a devastating but \ntreatable brain disorder marked by severe fluctuations in mood, \nactivity, thought, and behavior. In an effort to contribute to the \nsearch for a cure, Cameron volunteered to participate in a four-month \nlong rigorous clinical study at the National Institutes of Mental \nHealth in Bethesda, Maryland.\n  Though the exact prevalence is not known, the Child & Adolescent \nBipolar Foundation estimates that at least three quarters of a million \nAmerican children and teenagers currently suffer from bipolar disorder, \nmany of whom are undiagnosed. Bipolar disorder is thought to affect 1-2 \npercent of adults worldwide. Fifty-nine percent of adults with bipolar \ndisorder report that their symptoms first appeared during or before \nadolescence. The disorder is often inherited, and symptoms can emerge \nat any time in life.\n  Bipolar disorder has a significant impact on our society. Children \nwith the\n\n[[Page S3140]]\n\ncondition are at higher risk for school failure, substance abuse, and \nsuicide. The terrible human and social costs highlight the importance \nof discovering better treatments, and ultimately a cure, for bipolar \ndisorder. Few controlled studies have been done on the use of \npsychiatric medications in children. Cameron, however, is bravely doing \nhis part to increase our knowledge of this disease. Cameron volunteered \nto leave home for several months to participate in a study that \nrequired that he be locked in an 8-bed unit, submit to blood tests, \nbrain scans, and other tests, go off all medication, and receive \nlithium or placebo, possibly risking his own well-being in the process. \nHe consented to being forced into seclusion or medicated if his rages \ncould not be controlled. All the while, Cameron kept up with a home \nschool curriculum.\n  Cameron's decision to travel far from home to participate in a \ndifficult clinical trial--one that potentially puts himself at risk for \nthe benefit of others--will contribute to our understanding of \npediatric bipolar disorder and how to treat it. His self-sacrifice will \nlive on in the form of better treatment options for the many other \nchildren who, like him, must live with this condition. For that, \nCameron deserves our most sincere recognition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/04/senate-section/article/S3140-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM ``BILL'' DAVID SMITH\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I pay tribute and honor a \ndear friend of mine who passed away recently. Bill David Smith, whom I \nhave called a friend and relied on for half a century, passed away at \nthe age of 72. He is survived by his beloved wife, Jane Bandy Smith, \nand two sons, David and Stuart. Bill David was passionate about all \nthings in which he was involved, loved his community of Tuscaloosa, and \nwas very proud to be an Alabamian.\n  We became friends during our time at the University of Alabama, and I \nhave always appreciated his counsel and support over the years. My \nwife, Annette, and I have shared many memories with Bill David and his \nwife, Jane, which we will cherish for years to come.\n  Bill David was born in Meridian, MS, and spent most of his youth in \nGadsden, AL. A University of Alabama graduate, he was an honor student \nand received both a bachelor's and master's degree in accounting. After \ngraduation, he was a founding partner in the accounting firm, Morrison \nand Smith LLP. Bill David was actively involved in activities \nsurrounding the accounting profession and served as President of the \nAlabama Society of Certified Public Accountants and Chairman of its \nState Legislation Committee. He was also a member of the Council of the \nAmerican Institute of Certified Public Accountants.\n  Bill David was a member of the board of directors for the Alabama \nTrust Fund and the Business Council of Alabama. Dedicated to a number \nof civic organizations, he served on the Tuscaloosa County Juvenile \nAdvisory Board and the Alabama Juvenile Justice Coordinating Council.\n  Beyond Bill David's devotion to his work and his community, he was a \ndedicated friend to many. A good natured person with a huge heart, Bill \nDavid often showed compassion for those less fortunate. His quick wit \nand intellect fostered his passion for policy issues and politics. He \ncared very deeply for his community and its people.\n  But most of all, my thoughts and prayers go out to Jane and their two \nsons. Bill David was a dedicated family man and his presence will be \nmissed by those who knew him best. Indeed, we will all miss \nhim.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/04/senate-section/article/S3140-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            WE THE PEOPLE: THE CITIZEN AND THE CONSTITUTION\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, from April 30 through May 2, 2005, \nmore than 1,200 students from across the United States will visit \nWashington, D.C. to take part in the national finals of ``We the \nPeople: The Citizen and the Constitution,'' the most extensive \neducational program in the country developed specifically to educate \nyoung people about the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights. \nAdministered by the Center for Civic Education, the We the People \nprogram is funded by the U.S. Department of Education by act of \nCongress.\n  I am proud to report that a class from East Grand Rapids High School \nfrom Grand Rapids will represent the State of Michigan in this \nprestigious national event. These outstanding students, through their \nknowledge of the U.S. Constitution, won their statewide competition and \nearned the chance to come to our Nation's capital and compete at the \nnational level.\n  While in Washington, the students will participate in a 3-day \nacademic competition that simulates a congressional hearing in which \nthey ``testify'' before a panel of judges. Students demonstrate their \nknowledge and understanding of constitutional principles and have \nopportunities to evaluate, adopt, and defend positions on relevant \nhistorical and contemporary issues. It is important to note that the \nEducational Testing Service, ETS, characterizes the We the People \nprogram as a ``great instructional success.'' Independent studies by \nETS have revealed that We the People students ``significantly \noutperformed comparison students on every topic of the tests taken.''\n  I congratulate East Grand Rapids students John Abraham, Ted Bosch, \nRoss Brenneman, Katherine Fasse, Bill Frayer, Kyle Fuller, Joe \nGallmeyer, Will Gallmeyer, Katherine Harger, Jimmy Hogan, Christina \nKim, Peter Meyer, Lenard Robert, Sarah Stevens, Tully Svekric, Alyssa \nTitche, Gab Tourek, Dimitri Wohns and their teacher, Pierre A.

Mr. President, today I congratulate an extraordinary \nyoung woman, Rosemary Fay, aged 11. Rosemary, a sixth grader at St. \nThomas Aquinas School in Indianapolis, was the winner for her age group \nof the USA Today National Sportsmanship Essay Contest. The essay \ncontest was a part of the 15th National Sportsmanship Day, sponsored by \nthe Institute for International Sport, to raise awareness about fair \nplay, sportsmanship and ethics in athletics and society.\n  Nearly one thousand students submitted essays addressing \nsportsmanship and ethics or offering a personal reflection on good or \npoor sportsmanship. Students were asked to respond to the question, \n``Do you dare to play fair?''. A panel of judges chose the four \nwinners, including Rosemary, who was the winning writer among middle \nschool entrants.\n  In her touching reflection on the importance of sportsmanship, \nRosemary gives her own definition of what it means to be a good sport. \nShe writes, ``Good sports are confident, competitive and capable, but \nmost of all, they treat other people with respect and dignity. Their \nattitudes and actions show they have a higher purpose in life than just \nwinning today's game. Even when they lose, they act like winners.'' In \nthis day of bitter disputes, when what is truly important is often \novershadowed by a more immediate conflict, Rosemary's essay shows us \nhow to step back, remember the bigger picture and be a good sport.\n  Rosemary also writes about the influence of good sports in her life, \npaying tribute to her teammates whose good sportsmanship extends beyond \nthe field. Her essay concludes that ``Sportsmanship can make a huge \ndifference in a person's life. I know, because I am fortunate to be on \na team with truly great sports.'' She credits her teammates with \ninspiring her to perserve in sports.\n  Hoosiers have always known the importance of sports to American life. \nPlaying sports teach our children values like leadership, self-\ndiscipline, and the importance of hard work. Improving access to sports \nand afterschool athletic activities is a challenge that we must strive \nto accomplish, so that all students can benefit from the lessons \noutlined in Rosemary's essay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/04/senate-section/article/S3140-4", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3140-S3141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       40TH ANNIVERSARY OF FRIENDSHIP INDUSTRIES OF HARRISONBURG\n\n Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize \nFriendship Industries, of Harrisonburg, VA, for 40 years of service to \npersons with disabilities in Harrisonburg City and Rockingham County.\n\n[[Page S3141]]\n\n  Friendship Industries has been a pioneer in the community since its \ninception. The mission of the nonprofit social service agency is to \ndevelop and maintain employment and training opportunities for persons \nwith disabilities. Clients of the agency begin with a program called \nWork Adjustment. This program assists trainees with disabilities in \ntheir adjustment to a real work environment occurring within a \nsupportive and sheltered atmosphere. The individual learns appropriate \nwork behaviors and skills while developing the highest productivity \ninternally as a sheltered employee, and sometimes gets placed into \ncompetitive or supported jobs in the community.\n  Friendship Industries started with 8 young men with mental \nretardation and has since grown to provide services for over 120 men \nand women with differing degrees of mental retardation, mental illness, \nand/or physical illness. The agency's financial contribution to the \ncommunity has increased as well. Starting with a mere $20,000, the \nbudget of Friendship Industries now approaches $4 million. It employs \n20 staff to run the program, and contributes over $3.6 million to the \nHarrisonburg area through wages, contract services and job training and \nservices.\n  Mr. David Flick, president of Friendship Industries since 1976, has \nbeen instrumental in the growth and success of the program. With his \nleadership, the agency has expanded the access and breadth of the \nprogram by providing transportation to interested trainees and by \nforming a network of friendly area companies. I commend David for his \nunwavering support and passion for helping the disabled get back to \nwork in the Shenandoah Valley.\n  I congratulate Friendship Industries on 40 years of dedication to \nimproving the lives of persons with disabilities, and wish them \ncontinued success for many more years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/04/senate-section/article/S3141-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BILL MARTIN\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Stabenow and \nmyself, I rise to bring tribute to Ann Arbor, MI, resident Bill Martin. \nOn May 2 of this year, the Jewish Federation of Washtenaw County will \nconfer their Humanitarian Award on Bill Martin as an outstanding member \nof the community.\n  Throughout his life, Bill Marin has dedicated himself, publicly and \nprivately, to projects that involve, concern, and benefit the \ncommunity. When the Ann Arbor public schools needed extra funds for \nschool projects, Bill implemented the very successful 3-on-3 Superball \nbasketball tournament. He rallied a group of craftsmen to rebuild State \nranger cabins on Isle Royale and joined in the effort. And he answered \nthe calls of both the University of Michigan Athletic Department and \nthe United States Olympic Committee when they were engulfed in turmoil \nand scandal.\n  Bill Martin has been director of Intercollegiate Athletics at the \nUniversity of Michigan since 2000. Martin has also served as the \npresident of the United States Olympic Committee. An avid sailor, Bill \nMartin has also served as president of the United States Sailing \nFoundation, as well as the U.S. Sailing Association.\n  In 1968, Bill Martin founded First Martin Corporation, a diversified \nreal estate construction, development and management firm. He is also \nthe founder and chairman of the board of Bank of Ann Arbor.\n  Bill Martin's devotion to his community ranges beyond business and \nathletics. He has served as president of the Washtenaw Land \nConservancy, and has been a board member of the Ann Arbor Public \nSchools Foundation and the Washtenaw Technical Middle College. He has \nbeen a member of the advisory board of U-M's Center for the Education \nof Women and served on the Fales Committee of the U.S. Naval Academy. \nHe is currently on the board of directors of New York 2012, working to \nbring the Olympic Games to New York City.\n  He has been awarded numerous awards including the U.S. Olympic \nCommittee Award for outstanding service to the U.S. Olympic Committee \nand America's athletes, the Nathanial G. Herreshoff Trophy for \noutstanding contribution to the sport of sailing, the Bob Ufer \nDistinguished M Club Award, and ``Ann Arbor News' Citizen of the Year \nfor his service and contributions to the community.\n  Martin earned a bachelor of arts degree from Wittenberg University, a \ngraduate degree in economics from the University of Stockholm, and a \nMBA from the University of Michigan.\n  Bill and his wife Sally have lived in Ann Arbor since 1967 when they \nmet as students. They have two grown sons, Seth and Michael.\n  Senator Stabenow and I are delighted to have the opportunity to pay \ntribute to Bill Martin for all of his contributions to his community \nand congratulate him on his upcoming honor from the Jewish Federation \nof Washtenaw County.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/04/senate-section/article/S3141-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 BSU NATIONAL DEBATE AND SPEECH CHAMPS\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Boise \nState University's outstanding debate and speech team, the Talkin' \nBroncos, who captured the national title at the Biennial Pi Kappa Delta \nNational Tournament in St. Louis on March 20. The open tournament is \nthe Nation's oldest and largest team competition among 4-year schools \nwith forensics programs. More than 470 competitors representing 72 \nschools and 29 States participated in the event. The 14-member \nchampionship team also brought home an impressive 22 individual awards.\n  Many in this Chamber appreciate the importance of speech and debate \nin the business of government. Forensic skills translate into effective \ncommunication, and not just in politics. These young women and men have \ndeveloped techniques that will serve them throughout their lives, no \nmatter what career they decide to pursue. They have demonstrated \nexceptional oratory capabilities and the quick and incisive thinking \nneeded to communicate ideas and persuade others of the merits of their \nopinions in an expeditious manner.\n  I congratulate all the students on the team as well as their coaches \nand head coach Marty Most. I would especially like to recognize John \nPetty, national champion in the broadcast journalism division; and \nLacey Rammell-O'Brien and Nancy Henke for their recognition as two of \nonly nine All-Americans. Over the years, Boise State has firmly \nestablished itself as a national force for forensics, and the fact that \nmost of the students on the team are from Idaho high schools is a fine \ntestament to the strength of the secondary academic programs in my home \nstate. This national title is especially noteworthy, and I am proud to \nhonor Boise State University's tremendous achievement in the United \nStates Senate today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/04/senate-section/article/S3141-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3141-S3142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN RECOGNITION OF HARRY VINES\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

A bill to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to establish a \nprogram to provide assistance to small communities for use in carrying \nout projects and activities necessary to achieve or maintain compliance \nwith drinking water standards; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, communities within the State of New \nMexico and throughout the country will soon be faced with a costly \nsituation that was not of their making. Beginning in 2006, Federal \ndrinking water regulations established by the EPA will require \nsubstantial reductions in the amount of arsenic present in that water. \nToday the limit is 50 parts per billion in 2006 it will be 10 parts per \nbillion. Arsenic is indeed a poison when ingested at high amounts. It \nis also naturally occurring in much of the groundwater throughout the \nnation. Indeed, in Albuquerque, NM, the natural levels of arsenic are \naround 13 parts per billion. This illustrates the problem that the new \nstandards will create.\n  The bill that I introduce today recognizes that in some parts of \nAmerica, the burden will be too great for some communities to bear.\n  The bill does the following: (1) finds that small communities may not \nhave the resources to meet the new arsenic standards and that Federal \nprograms are not in place to address the issue; (2) creates a grant \nprogram for many small communities to help upgrade their water systems; \n(3) ensures that not less than 20 percent of the grant monies go to \ncommunities with less than 50,000 residents; and (4) authorizes \nappropriations of $1.9 billion for FY2006 and for each year through \nFY2011.\n  Let me tell you more about this problem. In New Mexico, the geology, \nthe make up of the rocks and dirt, results in relatively high levels of \narsenic in the groundwater. However, over time, New Mexico residents \nhave not experienced higher levels of diseases associated with arsenic.\n  Be that as it may, the standard is in our future and many small \ncommunities throughout New Mexico and the west will not be able to meet \nthe resulting financial burden. I am sure that if we have to fix our \nwater plants to meet the EPA's new standards, some in villages of 100 \npeople where they have a small water system and no other water source, \nit will create a significant financial burden. Because of this, I \nbelieve it is important to aid communities in meeting the coming \nstandards.\n  The financial burden facing many communities and individuals is \ngreat. The new standards could cost New Mexico communities between $370 \nmillion and $440 million to improve treatment systems, plus $18 million \na year in operating costs. Albuquerque, NM, is looking at having to \nspend up to $150 million to come into compliance; Rio Rancho is facing \n$60 million in improvements. Many small communities in New Mexico and \nthroughout the west are facing increases in their water\n\n[[Page S3150]]\n\nbills of $50 to $90 a month per individual. I need not say that most \npeople cannot afford such an increase.\n  Most of the technologies needed for water systems to remain in \ncompliance with the new requirements are advanced and will require a \nsignificant increase in the level of training and expertise of the \npublic water system operators in New Mexico and throughout the Nation. \nThis legislation will help these communities in upgrading their systems \nand training their people.\n  We are forcing communities to comply with drinking water standards \nthat many believe will not increase public health. The least we can do \nis help them meet the burden.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my statement and the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 689\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Community Drinking Water \n     Assistance Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) drinking water standards proposed and in effect as of \n     the date of enactment of this Act will place a large \n     financial burden on many public water systems, especially \n     those public water systems in rural communities serving small \n     populations;\n       (2) the limited scientific, technical, and professional \n     resources available in small communities complicate the \n     implementation of regulatory requirements;\n       (3) small communities often cannot afford to meet water \n     quality standards because of the expenses associated with \n     upgrading public water systems and training personnel to \n     operate and maintain the public water systems;\n       (4) small communities do not have a tax base for dealing \n     with the costs of upgrading their public water systems;\n       (5) small communities face high per capita costs in \n     improving drinking water quality;\n       (6) small communities would greatly benefit from a grant \n     program designed to provide funding for water quality \n     projects;\n       (7) as of the date of enactment of this Act, there is no \n     Federal program in effect that adequately meets the needs of \n     small, primarily rural communities with respect to public \n     water systems; and\n       (8) since new, more protective arsenic drinking water \n     standards proposed by the Clinton and Bush administrations, \n     respectively, are expected to be implemented in 2006, the \n     grant program established by the amendment made by this Act \n     should be implemented in a manner that ensures that the \n     implementation of those new standards is not delayed.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st \nCentury to provide for the Highway Trust Fund additional funding for \nIndian reservation roads, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nIndian Affairs.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``American \nIndian Reservation Transportation Improvement Program Act.'' This act \nwill provide the people of Indian Country with the resources they need \nto upgrade their decaying road system.\n  In 1982, when I served on the Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, several members of the Navajo Nation Tribal Council \nCommittee on Transportation approached me with an interesting \nproposition. These Navajo Councilmen believed the time had come for \nIndian tribes to participate directly in our National Highway Trust \nFund programs.\n  I agreed with these gentlemen, the Senate agreed with me, and the \nCongress and President Reagan approved Indian tribal participation in \nthe U.S. Department of Transportation highway construction program for \nthe first time in our Nation's history.\n  By the mid-1980s, Indian Reservation Roads, IRR, funding was at about \n$100 million per year nationwide. By the late 1980s, however, IRR \nfunding fell to about $80 million per year. In the Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act, ISTEA, for the 1990s, we were able to \nraise this critical highway construction funding to about $190 million \nper year.\n  Then, in TEA-21, The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, \nwe succeeded in bringing annual IRR funding up to $275 million for \nfiscal years 1999 through 2003.\n  As we seek to promote economic opportunities on our Nation's tribal \nreservations, I believe it is imperative that we once again increase \nthis vital infrastructure funding. I am aware that many groups have \nadvocated for much greater increases in funding for Indian Reservation \nRoads. While I am sympathetic to the need for such large increases, I \nam keenly aware of competing needs around the country for medical \nresearch, economic stimulus, and for our national defense, to name just \na few. Therefore, I am compelled to recommend increases for the IRR \nprogram that are more likely to win acceptance among my colleagues.\n  For highway construction, I am recommending an immediate increase of \n$55 million in the first year to a new total of $330 million. My bill \nwould then increase the amount for construction by $30 million each \nyear so that the program receives $480 million in the final year of the \nauthorization. For the Indian bridge program, I am recommending $15 \nmillion per year, an increase of $6 million annually. And for state \nroads that serve as key bus routes for Indian children, primarily on \nour Nation's largest Indian reservation--the Navajo Nation--I am \nrecommending increasing this vital funding from $1.5 million per year \nto $3 million to retroactively fund fiscal years 2004 and 2005, to $4 \nmillion in fiscal years 2006 and 2007, and $5 million for fiscal years \n2008 and 2009.\n  My final recommendation is to create a rural transit program for \nIndian reservations. Because the Federal Highway Administration and the \nFederal Transit Administration each have their areas of expertise that \ncan make such a program a success, my legislation will require the two \nagencies to work together for the benefit of the tribes who participate \nin this program. My suggestion is to fund this program at $20 million.\n  In closing, I thank the Navajo Nation Transportation Committee and \nthe tribal transportation department for keeping me informed of their \nprogress and continuing needs. I believe my bill will be a positive \nanswer to their requests. In addition, the Pueblo Indians and Apache \nIndians of New Mexico have continuing development needs, including new \nand improved roads to reach their many attractions for tourists and \nother visitors.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in increasing the Indian Reservation \nRoads program funds in our Federal highways programs to the degree I \nhave requested in this bill. I thank my colleagues and urge their \nsupport for these increases as we reauthorize TEA-21 for 6 more years.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 690\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the conveyance of certain public land \nin northwestern New Mexico by resolving a dispute associated with coal \npreference right lease interests on the land; to the Committee on \nIndian Affairs.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased today to be introducing the \nBisti PRLA Dispute Resolution Act of 2005, which will resolve a \nconflict regarding coal mining leases in New Mexico and which will \nconfirm the completion of all Navajo Nation land selections in New \nMexico under the Navajo-Hopi Settlement Act. Arch Coal Company and the \nNavajo Nation have been deadlocked within the Department of the \nInterior appeals process regarding certain preference right lease \napplications, PRLAs, in the Bisti region of northwestern New Mexico. \nWhen enacted, this legislation will resolve a complex set of issues \narising from legal rights the Arch Coal Company acquired in Federal \nlands, which are now situated among lands which constitute tribal \nproperty and the allotments of members of the Navajo Nation. Both Arch \nCoal and the Navajo Nation support this legislation to resolve the \nsituation in a manner that is mutually beneficial. In addition, this \nlegislation will serve to mandate the completion of a longstanding set \nof land selections the Navajo Nation made under the Navajo-Hopi \nSettlement Act. In 1984 amendments to that act, Congress provided the \nNavajo Nation with its final opportunity, within 18 months of passage \nof the amendments, to select lands in New Mexico as provided in section \n11 of the Navajo-Hopi Settlement Act. The Navajo Nation exercised its \nrights under the 1984 Amendments, but since has sought to review, \nrevise, and seek to select other lands to the potential detriment of \nmineral lessees holding leases on Federal public lands near the Navajo \nreservation. This legislation would clarify Congress's intent that the \nnation no longer has land selection rights available to it in New \nMexico under the Navajo-Hopi Settlement Act.\n  There are many reasons the solution embodied in this bill achieves \nbroad benefits to the interested parties and the public. It will \nresolve a longstanding conflict between the Navajo Nation and Arch Coal \nand allow the Navajo Nation to complete the land selections in New \nMexico that were made in the 1980s to promote tribal member \nresettlement following the partition of lands in Arizona to the Hopi \nTribe. Specifically, section 4(a)(1) will clarify and confirm that the \nNavajo Nation already has selected the lands to which it entitled under \nthe Navajo-Hopi Settlement Act and has no further rights under that act \nto select lands in New Mexico other than those already selected by the \nNavajo Nation in the 1980s.\n  The bill also guarantees that Arch Coal, Inc. will be compensated for \nthe economic value of its coal reserves. An independent panel will make \nrecommendations to the Secretary of the Interior regarding the fair \nmarket value of the coal reserves, gives the company bidding rights, \nprotects a State's financial interest in its share of Federal Mineral \nLeasing Act payments, and allows the Navajo Nation beneficial ownership \nin their lands.\n  The Secretary of the Interior will issue a certificate of bidding \nrights to Arch Coal upon relinquishment of its interests in the PRLAs. \nThe amount of that certificate will equal the fair market value of the \ncoal reserves as defined by the Department of the Interior's \nregulations. A panel consisting of representatives of the Department of \nthe Interior, Arch Coal, and the Governors of Wyoming and New Mexico \nwill help determine fair market value. While the Interior Department is \nauthorized to exchange PRLAs for bidding rights, the Department has not \ndone so, largely because of the difficulty it perceives in determining \nthe fair market value of the coal reserves. The panel method in this \nlegislation will promote the objectivity of that process.\n  Upon the relinquishment of the PRLAs and the issuance of a \ncertificate of bidding rights, the Department of the Interior will \nexecute patents to the Navajo Nation of the lands encompassed by the \nPRLAs. This is a win-win situation for all parties involved, is \nendorsed by the affected parties, and is a fair resolution to this \nongoing problem.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 692\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to modify the prohibition on recognition by United \nStates courts of certain rights relating to certain marks, trade names, \nor commercial names; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will protect U.S. trademarks and their legitimate owners from the \neffects of the confiscations decreed by the Cuban Government.\n  My colleagues and I believe in the fundamental principle that \nproperty rights must be respected and that it is wrong for governments \nto take property from individuals and companies, whether nationals or \nforeigners, without payment of prompt, adequate and effective \ncompensation. We uphold the firmly established principle of our law and \npublic policy that foreign confiscatory measures must never be given \neffect on property situated in the United States.\n  When the Castro regime took power in Cuba, it engaged in a program of \nwholesale confiscation of property in Cuba, including property owned by \nCuban nationals as well as by U.S. and other non-Cuban nationals. The \nCuban Government also purported to extend the effects of the \nconfiscation to property, such as trademarks, that the confiscation \nvictims owned in other countries, and took other actions in an attempt \nto seize control of such assets.\n  To protect U.S. trademarks and their legitimate owners from the \neffects of the confiscations decreed by the Cuban government, Congress \nenacted Section 211 of H.R. 4328, PL 105-277, in 1998. This law, \nreferred to as Section 211, prohibits enforcement of U.S. rights to \ntrademarks confiscated by the Cuban Government, except with the consent \nof the legitimate owner. Section 211 simply made it clear that the \nuniversal U.S. policy against giving effect to foreign confiscations of \nU.S. property applies with equal force in the case of U.S. trademarks \nconfiscated by Cuba.\n  Section 211 was challenged in the World Trade Organization, WTO, by \nthe European Union, EU. In January 2002, the WTO appellate body finally \nresolved that challenge by finding in favor of the United States on all \npoints except one. The appellate body made a narrow finding that, \nbecause Section 211 on its face does not apply to U.S. nationals, it is \ninconsistent with the national-treatment and most-favored-nation \nprinciples under the TRIPs Agreement. The appellate body fully \nsupported the principle embodied in Section 211, that is, the non-\nrecognition of uncompensated confiscations and the protection of \nintellectual property ownership rights. The revision required to \nbroaden the application of Section 211 to include U.S. nationals \namounts to no more than a minor, technical fix.\n  The legislation that I introduce today makes it clear that this well-\nfounded law applies to all parties claiming rights in confiscated Cuban \ntrademarks, regardless of nationality. Such a technical correction will \nsatisfy the WTO ruling and prevent the EU from applying trade sanctions \nagainst the United States at the end of this year. Moreover, this \nlegislation does three things: it maintains protection for original \nowners of confiscated Cuban trademarks; it applies to all people, \nregardless of nationality; and it clarifies that trademarks and trade \nnames confiscated by the Cuban Government will not be recognized in the \nUnited States when the assertion is being made by someone who knew or \nhad reason to know that the mark was confiscated.\n  This bill does not in any way decide which party owns a Cuban \ntrademark in the U.S. nor does Section 211 prevent the Cuban Government \nor its various entities from having access to our courts or from \nregistering legitimate trademarks in the U.S. As long as the trademark \nwas not confiscated, the Cuban Government can legally register any \ntrademark it desires. Moreover, even if the Cuban Government stole a \ntrademark in the 1960s, it can still register the trademark in the U.S \nas long as the original owner has consented.\n  Once revised, Section 211 is consistent with all of our international \ntreaty obligations including the Inter-American Convention on \nTrademarks. Article 3 of the Inter-American Convention expressly allows \nnon-recognition of a trademark when such recognition would be contrary \nto the public order or public policy of the state in which recognition \nis sought. There is no doubt whatsoever that allowing title to U.S. \nproperty to be determined by a foreign confiscation violates U.S. \npublic policy. Section 211 simply makes it clear that the universal \nU.S. policy against giving effect to foreign confiscations of U.S. \nproperty applies with equal force in the case of U.S. trademarks \nconfiscated by Cuba. Nothing in any treaty or in international law is \ninconsistent with that rule of U.S. law.\n  I believe this piece of legislation is a simple technical corrections \nbill which will ensure that a fairly simple, but important, U.S. law is \nWTO-compliant.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 691\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for judicial review of national security \nletters issued to wire and electronic communications service providers; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, it has been nearly 4 years since the \nterrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. In the days, weeks, and months \nsince that day, the American people have braced themselves for the \npossibility of another terrorist attack on our homeland. After all, we \nknow all too well that al-Qaida is a stealthy, sophisticated, and \npatient enemy, and that its leadership is extremely motivated to launch \nanother devastating attack on American soil and American citizens.\n  In fact, outside the United States, al-Qaida and affiliates of al-\nQaida have continued to be enormously active, responsible for numerous \nterrorist attacks on foreign soil in the last few years:\n  2001 (Dec.): Man tried to denote shoe bomb on flight from Paris to \nMiami.\n  2002 (April): Explosion at historic synagogue in Tunisia left 21 \ndead, including 14 German tourists.\n  2002 (May): Car exploded outside hotel in Karachi, Pakistan, killing \n14, including 11 French citizens.\n  2002 (June): Bomb exploded outside American consulate in Karachi, \nPakistan, killing 12.\n  2002 (Oct.): Boat crashed into oil tanker off Yemen coast, killing \none.\n  2002 (Oct.): Nightclub bombings in Bali, Indonesia, killed 202, \nmostly Australian citizens.\n  2002 (Nov.): Suicide attack on a hotel in Mombasa, Kenya, killed 16.\n  2003 (May): Suicide bombers killed 34, including 8 Americans, at \nhousing compounds for Westerners in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n  2003 (May): Four bombs killed 33 people targeting Jewish, Spanish, \nand Belgian sites in Casablanca, Morocco.\n  2003 (Aug.): Suicide car-bomb killed 12, injured 150 at Marriott \nHotel in Jakarta, Indonesia.\n  2003 (Nov.): Explosions rocked a Riyadh, Saudi Arabia housing \ncompound, killing 17.\n  2003 (Nov.): Suicide car-bombers simultaneously attacked two \nsynagogues in Istanbul, Turkey, killing 25 and injuring hundreds.\n  2003 (Nov.): Truck bombs detonated at London bank and British \nconsulate in Istanbul, Turkey, killing 26.\n  2004 (March): Ten terrorists bombs exploded almost simultaneously \nduring the morning rush hour in Madrid, Spain, killing 202 and injuring \nmore than 1,400.\n  2004 (May): Terrorists attacked Saudi oil company offices in Khobar, \nSaudi Arabia, killing 22.\n  2004 (June): Terrorists kidnapped and executed American Paul Johnson, \nJr., in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n  2004 (Sept.): Car bomb outside the Australian embassy in Jakarta, \nIndonesia, killed nine.\n  2004 (Dec.): Terrorists enter the U.S. Consulate in Jiddah, Saudi \nArabia, killing nine (including 4 attackers).\n  It is precisely because al-Qaida is so aggressive, so motivated, and \nso demonstrably hostile to America, that I am so grateful that, to \ndate, al-Qaida still has not successfully launched another terrorist \nattack on our own soil. There are undoubtedly many reasons for this. \nFirst and foremost, I am profoundly thankful to the brave men and women \nof our Armed Forces, who fight the terrorists abroad so that we do not \nhave to face them at home. I also firmly believe that our efforts to \nstrengthen anti-terrorism and law enforcement tools right here at home \nhave much to do with this record of success and peace in our homeland \nto date.\n  It is within this important context that a Senate Judiciary Committee \nhearing tomorrow morning will commence a new round of discussions about \nthe USA PATRIOT Act. As I explained in an op-ed published in the \nWashington Times just this morning, I welcome that hearing, because the \nAmerican people deserve an honest, responsible, and fair discussion to \nensure that we are indeed fulfilling our dual responsibilities to \nprotect national security and civil liberties alike.\n  Unfortunately, the debate about the USA PATRIOT Act has not always \nmet that standard. Last fall, just weeks before the Presidential \nelection, we even witnessed false reports in newspapers across the \ncountry that a Federal court had struck down parts of the act as \nunconstitutional. False reports and scare tactics serve no legitimate \ncause and greatly disserve the American people.\n  The war on terrorism must be fought aggressively but consistently \nwith the protection of civil rights and civil liberties. Whenever real \ncivil liberties problems do arise, we must learn about them right away, \nso that we can fix them swiftly.\n  It is for precisely this reason that I have long been concerned about \nfalse allegations of civil rights deprivations. Every false allegation \nundermines every true allegation, and that hurts us all. After all, \nscaring people about false civil rights deprivations unnecessarily \ndivides our Nation and makes no one safer. If anything, false claims \nabout civil liberties actually make it harder to monitor real civil \nliberties issues in the future--for the same reason that eventually no \none listened to the fabled little boy who kept ``crying wolf.''\n\n  After several weeks of negotiation, Congress in 2001 enacted the USA \nPATRIOT Act by overwhelming bipartisan margins--98-1 in the Senate and \n357-66 in the House. At the time, Senators on both sides of the aisle \nagreed that the legislation had struck a careful and wise balance \nbetween national security and civil liberties.\n  The record continues to be strong to this day. As Senator Dianne \nFeinstein at a Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing during the \nlast Congress, ``I have never had a single abuse of the PATRIOT Act \nreported to me. My staff e-mailed the ACLU and asked them for instances \nof actual abuses. They e-mailed back and said they had none.''\n  The ACLU did allege in a press release last September that a Federal \ncourt had struck down parts of the USA PATRIOT Act--calling the \ndecision ``a landmark victory against the Ashcroft Justice \nDepartment.'' See Doe v. Ashcroft, 334 F. Supp. 2d 471 (S.D.N.Y. 2004). \nThe litigation is currently on appeal.\n  Newspapers across the country immediately repeated the ACLU's \nmessage. But as legal experts immediately discovered, there were two \nimportant problems with the allegation: they were attacking the wrong \nperson, and the wrong law.\n  In fact, the court had actually struck down a law authored by Senator \nPatrick Leahy during the 1980s. That statute balanced the national \ninterest in protecting electronic communications privacy against the \nlegitimate needs of national security, by establishing a procedure for \nobtaining electronic communications records in certain national \nsecurity investigations through the use of so-called ``national \nsecurity letters.'' The USA PATRIOT Act amended the law to make clear \nthat such letters could be issued in terrorism investigations as well.\n  So the statute in question was written by Leahy, not Ashcroft. And it \nwas the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, not the USA \nPATRIOT Act in 2001. Indeed, the USA PATRIOT Act did not change a \nsingle word of any provision attacked by that court.\n  What's more, in 1986, the ACLU endorsed the Electronic Communications \nPrivacy Act. And shortly after that law was approved by the Senate on a \nvoice vote and the House by unanimous consent, the chief legislative \ncounsel of the ACLU called it a ``significant advancement of privacy \nrights of citizens in the age of new communications technology.''\n  None of this stopped the ACLU in 2004, however, from charging that \nthe court's ruling was ``the first to strike down any of the vast new \nsurveillance powers authorized by the Patriot Act.''\n  The ACLU has since backed down and admitted that they had attacked \nthe wrong law. As ACLU attorney Jameel Jaffer eventually conceded, \n``the provisions that we challenged and that the court objected to were \nin the statute before the Patriot Act was passed. We could have \nraised the same objections before the power was expanded.'' \nNevertheless, it hurts all of us whenever an allegation about civil \nliberties is discredited--because it makes it that much easier to \nignore legitimate civil liberties problems that may arise in the \nfuture.\n\n  It's also worth noting that the primary controversy in the \nlitigation--whether judicial review is available to scrutinize the \nissuance of national security letters--was not actually disputed by the \ngovernment. To the contrary, the Justice Department agreed that there \nshould be judicial review. The court simply concluded that the\n\n[[Page S3155]]\n\n1986 law was not drafted with sufficient clarity to authorize such \nreview.\n  Today, I introduce legislation to cure this technical defect, and to \namend the Electronic Communications Privacy Act to make explicit the \navailability of judicial review to examine national security letters. \nThe legislation is entitled the Electronic Communications Privacy \nJudicial Review and Improvement Act of 2005. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the legislation, as well as a section-by-section \nanalysis of the legislation prepared by my office, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  I hope that this legislation will be enacted in the same bipartisan \nspirit that put both the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and the \nUSA PATRIOT Act on the books. And I hope that future discussions about \nthe war on terrorism, civil liberties, and the USA PATRIOT Act will be \nhonest, responsible, and fair.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 693\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

It generally forbids \n     nonconsensual, unauthorized disclosures of private electronic \n     communications by communications providers, while authorizing \n     the Federal Bureau of Investigation to issue so-called \n     ``national security letters'' under certain conditions in \n     order to obtain certain kinds of communications records from \n     such providers. The original 1986 law authorized national \n     security letters in foreign counterintelligence \n     investigations; section 505 of the USA PATRIOT Act amended \n     the 1986 Act to explicitly permit the issuance of such \n     letters in international terrorism investigations as well.\n       The 1986 Act was authored by U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy and \n     approved by the Senate on a voice vote and the House by \n     unanimous consent. It was endorsed by a number of \n     organizations, including civil liberties and privacy \n     advocates. The ACLU's chief legislative counsel and director \n     of its project on technology and privacy called the \n     legislation a ``significant advancement of privacy rights of \n     citizens in the age of new communications technology,'' \n     according to a December 5, 1986 article in the Christian \n     Science Monitor.\n       The national security letter provision of the Electronic \n     Communications Privacy Act of 1986 has recently been \n     challenged in federal court. During the course of the \n     litigation, Justice Department attorneys agreed that there \n     should be judicial review of national security letters, and \n     argued that current law already provides for such review. \n     Nevertheless, last September a federal district court in New \n     York struck down the Electronic Communications Privacy Act as \n     unconstitutional because it does not explicitly authorize \n     judicial review. See Doe v. Ashcroft, 334 F. Supp. 2d 471 \n     (S.D.N.Y. 2004). This litigation--which is currently on \n     appeal--presents an important legal dispute concerning \n     whether the Electronic Communications Privacy Act implicitly \n     provides for judicial review of national security letters. It \n     may be helpful for Congress to enact an explicit provision \n     authorizing judicial review, to avoid any ambiguity and to \n     provide clearer guidance to national security letter \n     recipients and parties in litigation in the future.\n       Accordingly, the Electronic Communications Privacy Judicial \n     Review and Improvement Act of 2005 responds to the Doe v. \n     Ashcroft litigation by establishing an explicit judicial \n     review provision for national security letters.\n       Section 1. Short title.\n       Section 2. Judicial review. This provision explicitly \n     authorizes a recipient of a national security letter to seek \n     judicial review in federal court to prevent enforcement of \n     the letter. The provision states that a court may modify or \n     set aside the national security letter if compliance would be \n     unreasonable or oppressive--the same standard that governs \n     grand jury subpoenas. See Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure \n     17(c)(2). Courts have made clear that, under this standard, \n     requests must be relevant to the underlying investigation. \n     See, e.g., U.S. v. R. Enterprises Inc., 498 U.S. 292, 301 \n     (1991) (requiring ``reasonable possibility that the category \n     of materials the Government seeks will produce information \n     relevant to the general subject of the grand jury's \n     investigation'').\n       This provision also explicitly authorizes a recipient at \n     any time to seek judicial review in federal court to set \n     aside the nondisclosure requirement imposed by the original \n     1986 law. The 1986 Act forbids recipients from disclosing to \n     any person that the FBI has issued the national security \n     letter. This bill provides that a court may modify or set \n     aside the nondisclosure requirement if there is no reason to \n     believe that disclosure may endanger the national security of \n     the United States, interfere with a criminal, \n     counterterrorism, or counterintelligence investigation, \n     interfere with diplomatic relations, or endanger the life or \n     physical safety of any person. The provision also provides \n     that, in reviewing a nondisclosure requirement, the \n     certification by the Government that disclosure may endanger \n     of the national security of the United States or interfere \n     with diplomatic relations shall be treated as conclusive \n     unless the court finds that the certification was made in bad \n     faith.\n       Section 3. Enforcement of national security letters. This \n     provision authorizes the Attorney General to seek enforcement \n     of a national security letter in federal court if a recipient \n     refuses to comply.\n       Section 4. Disclosure of information. This provision \n     establishes that the judicial review proceedings established \n     by this bill may be secured against disclosure pursuant to \n     the provisions of the Classified Information Procedures Act.\n       This provision also makes clear that the nondisclosure \n     requirement of the 1986 law does not forbid conversations \n     with the recipient's attorney to obtain legal advice \n     regarding the request, nor does it forbid conversations with \n     persons to whom disclosure would be necessary to comply with \n     the request. All participants in such conversations\n\n[[Page S3156]]\n\n     are forbidden from disclosing the existence of the national \n     security letter, consistent with the requirements of the \n     original 1986 law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COLEMAN:\n  S. 694.

Res. 94\n\n       Whereas His Holiness, Pope John Paul II, was born Karol \n     Jozef Wojtyla in Wadowice, Poland, on May 18, 1920, the \n     youngest of 3 children, born to Karol Wojtyla and Emilia \n     Kaczorowska;\n       Whereas Pope John Paul II personally suffered and \n     experienced deprivation from an early age, losing his mother, \n     eldest brother, and father before turning age 21;\n       Whereas Pope John Paul II found comfort and strength in the \n     example of his father's faith, of whom he observed ``after my \n     mother's death, his life became one of constant prayer. \n     Sometimes I would wake up during the night and find my father \n     on his knees . . . his example was in a way my first \n     seminary'';\n       Whereas, in 1939, Pope John Paul II was enrolled in \n     Jagiellonian University in Cracow, which was closed by the \n     Nazis during their occupation of Poland;\n       Whereas Pope John Paul II experienced the brutality of a \n     godless totalitarian regime, which sought to eradicate the \n     history and culture of a proud people and sent many of his \n     professors, friends, and millions of Polish Jews to camps \n     where they were systematically murdered;\n       Whereas, in 1942, Pope John Paul II was himself arrested by \n     Nazi occupation forces, but his life was spared because of \n     his employment at a limestone quarry, work deemed essential \n     to the war effort;\n       Whereas Pope John Paul II courageously defied the Nazi \n     occupation forces, risking his own life to protect Polish \n     Jews from persecution, helping to organize the underground \n     ``Rhapsodic Theatre'', which he intended to be ``a theatre . \n     . . where the national spirit will burn'', writing two \n     religious plays considered subversive to the Nazi regime, and \n     enrolling in the clandestine seminary of Archbishop Sapieha \n     of Cracow, where he studied religion, theology, and \n     philosophy;\n       Whereas the Nazi occupation of Poland was ended only by the \n     imposition of a Communist era of occupation that sought to \n     subjugate Polish citizens, extinguish Polish nationalism, and \n     subjected the exercise of individual religious liberty to the \n     control of godless Stalinist rulers;\n       Whereas, in 1946, Pope John Paul II was ordained, later \n     becoming a Professor of Ethics and Chaplain at the Catholic \n     University of Lublin, the only Catholic university behind the \n     Iron Curtain, where he, again at great personal risk, \n     initiated activities that helped to preserve the \n     intellectual, cultural, and historical richness of his \n     homeland and protected the integrity and independence of the \n     Catholic Church in Poland;\n       Whereas Pope John Paul II was an articulate and outspoken \n     advocate for religious freedom and Christian humanism at \n     Vatican Council II, asserting that the Church could not claim \n     religious liberty for itself unless it was willing to concede \n     it to others;\n       Whereas Pope John Paul II, upon returning to his homeland, \n     frequently cited the Council's declaration that religious \n     freedom was ``the first of human rights'', a phrase embraced \n     by Polish Catholics in their struggle against the hegemony of \n     the Communist regime;\n       Whereas, on October 16, 1978, Pope John Paul II was elected \n     the 264th Pope, making history by becoming the first-ever \n     Slavic Pope and the first non-Italian Pope in more than 400 \n     years;\n       Whereas Pope John Paul II served for over 26 years as \n     Bishop of Rome and Supreme Pastor of the Catholic Church, and \n     as the spiritual leader of more than 1,000,000,000 Catholic \n     Christians around the world, including more than 66,000,000 \n     Catholic Christians in the United States;\n       Whereas Pope John Paul II served the third-longest \n     pontificate, behind only Saint Peter, who served as Pope for \n     over 34 years, and Blessed Pius IX, who served for over 31 \n     years;\n\n[[Page S3157]]\n\n       Whereas Pope John Paul II was a unique, substantial, and \n     historic catalyst in the demise of Soviet communism and the \n     emancipation of hundreds of millions of people from \n     totalitarian rule;\n       Whereas Pope John Paul II, in his inaugural sermon, boldly \n     offered hope to oppressed peoples around the world while \n     causing authoritarian rulers to brace by proclaiming ``open \n     the boundaries of states, economic and political systems, the \n     vast fields of culture, civilization, and development. Do not \n     be afraid.'';\n       Whereas, in June 1979, Pope John Paul II returned to his \n     native Poland for 9 days, unleashing patriotic and religious \n     forces that would ultimately lead to the peaceful toppling of \n     the Communist regime in Poland and the dramatic demise of the \n     Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union;\n       Whereas Pope John Paul II, before visiting his native \n     Poland in 1987, met with President Ronald Reagan, who \n     recognized the fruits of His Holiness' labors by stating ``be \n     assured that the hearts of the American people are with you. \n     Our prayers will go with you in profound hope that the \n     terrible burden of brave people everywhere who yearn for \n     freedom, even as all men and women yearn for the freedom that \n     God gave us all. . . . We see the power of the spiritual \n     force in that troubled land, uniting a people in hope, just \n     as we see the powerful stirrings in the East of a belief that \n     will not die despite generations of oppression. . . . For \n     despite all the attempts to extinguish it, the people's faith \n     burns with a passionate heat: once allowed to breathe free, \n     that faith will burn so brightly it will light the world.'';\n       Whereas Pope John Paul II was recognized by Lady Margaret \n     Thatcher to have ``provided the main impetus for the revival \n     of Solidarity and the pressure for reform [in his native \n     Poland]'';\n       Whereas Pope John Paul II was acknowledged by Mikhail \n     Gorbachev to have played an essential role in the liberation \n     of those who lived under European communism when he stated \n     ``everything that happened in Eastern Europe . . . would have \n     been impossible without this Pope'';\n       Whereas Pope John Paul II carried on an active \n     correspondence with world leaders during the 1980s, involving \n     the Church in efforts to promote peace by reducing tensions, \n     and exerting his moral authority to persuade the superpowers \n     to engage in a ``dialogue'' that succeeded in reducing \n     conventional and nuclear weapons and helped to avert a \n     nuclear war;\n       Whereas Pope John Paul II used public and private diplomacy \n     and the power of moral persuasion to encourage world leaders \n     to respect the inalienable rights of the human person;\n       Whereas, on May 13, 1981, Pope John Paul II, was shot by a \n     would-be assassin, and nevertheless provided a remarkable \n     example of the power of grace, later visiting his attacker in \n     prison, and stating afterwards ``I spoke to him as I would \n     speak to a brother whom I have forgiven and who enjoys my \n     confidence'';\n       Whereas Pope John Paul II ministered to Catholic and non-\n     Catholic alike, providing a personal example of grace, \n     endurance, compassion, courage, sacrifice, and foresight;\n       Whereas Pope John Paul II sought to heal divisions between \n     the Catholic Church and other Christian faiths, the Jewish \n     faith, and Islam, expressing sadness and regret for the \n     individual acts of present and former Catholics who \n     persecuted members of other faiths and promoting \n     reconciliation and dialogue through the first-ever Papal \n     visits to synagogues and mosques, as well as visits to areas \n     of historic conflict, including Ireland and the Holy Land;\n       Whereas, in 1995, Pope John Paul II wrote of ``the \n     incomparable worth of the human person,'' noting that: ``Even \n     in the midst of difficulties and uncertainties, every person \n     sincerely open to truth and goodness can, by the light of \n     reason and the hidden action of grace, come to recognize . . \n     . the sacred value of human life . . . and can affirm the \n     right of every human being to have this primary good \n     respected to the highest degree'';\n       Whereas, in 1998, Pope John Paul II visited Cuba to speak \n     directly to the Cuban people and their Communist rulers, \n     calling for political and religious freedom, the release of \n     political prisoners, a recognition of the right to express \n     one's faith ``in the context of public life'', and the \n     importance of fundamental human dignities, including that \n     ``each person enjoying freedom of expression, being free to \n     undertake initiatives and make proposals within civil \n     society, and enjoying appropriate freedom of association'' is \n     a necessity;\n       Whereas Pope John Paul II traveled farther than any other \n     Pope in history, traversing approximately \\3/4\\ of a million \n     miles, visiting 130 countries, including African nations \n     never before visited by a Pope, being seen by more people \n     than anyone in human history, and evangelizing to more than \n     6,000,000 people in the closing mass of World Youth Day '95 \n     in the Philippines;\n       Whereas Pope John Paul II changed the course of history, \n     leading the Catholic Church through a dramatic and remarkable \n     period, and into Christianity's third millennium;\n       Whereas Pope John Paul II devoted his life to the \n     amelioration of the human cost of terror and oppression \n     through his dedication to truth, forgiveness, and the \n     development of a vibrant public moral culture;\n       Whereas Pope John Paul II articulated the importance of \n     individual liberty being undergirded by a ``moral order'', \n     embraced the poor and oppressed masses of the world, and \n     encouraged governments and the faithful to attend to the \n     needs of those who are less fortunate;\n       Whereas Pope John Paul II brought hope and inspiration to \n     hundreds of millions of people around the world oppressed by \n     tyranny, hunger, disease, and despair;\n       Whereas Pope John Paul II worked tirelessly to bring peace \n     to regions of the world that have been driven by strife, \n     intolerance, hatred, and violence for far too long;\n       Whereas Pope John Paul II changed the lives of billions of \n     people across the globe;\n       Whereas Pope John Paul II died on April 2, 2005, after \n     heroically proclaiming the value and dignity of human life \n     through his long physical illness and suffering;\n       Whereas the passing of Pope John Paul II is mourned by \n     billions of people around the world; and\n       Whereas Pope John Paul II is already being referred to as \n     Pope John Paul the Great: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) notes with deep sorrow and solemn mourning the death of \n     His Holiness, Pope John Paul II;\n       (2) extends its heartfelt sympathy to all people who have \n     been touched by the passing of John Paul II;\n       (3) commends Pope John Paul II for his ability to transcend \n     the bounds of religion, race, and political thought, becoming \n     a formidable champion, uniter, and defender in humanity's \n     struggle for peace and basic human rights; and\n       (4) calls on all the people of the United States to reflect \n     on the life and legacy of Pope John Paul II during this \n     international period of remembrance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url":
