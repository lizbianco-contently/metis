Senators will be able to offer \ntheir amendments today. There will be no rollcall votes today, but we \ndo want to encourage Senators, if they are going to offer amendments, \nto present them to their respective leaders so we can plan \nappropriately. We will continue to debate through today. No votes will \noccur today, but we will be voting Monday afternoon at approximately \n5:30. We will be announcing a specific time a little bit later. We will \nreturn to the Foreign Operations bill on Monday, and I hope we will be \nable to complete that bill on Monday.\n  I do thank all Members for their assistance in moving these \nappropriations bills to conclusion. We are moving in an expeditious way \nand I appreciate everybody's support.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/15/senate-section/article/S8332-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8332-S8333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8332]]\n                   SENATE ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND AGENDA\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as we conclude our first week back from \nrecess, having 2 more weeks in this block of time before our August \nrecess, I want to take a moment to reflect on how far we have come and \nwhat accomplishments have been made during this 109th Congress and to \nbriefly talk about the tasks that are ahead of us.\n  With the prospect of a Supreme Court nomination looming, some people \nare predicting the Senate is going to get tied up and balled up in \npartisan conflict and we are not going to be able to simultaneously \nadvise and consent--our constitutional responsibility--on the \nPresident's nominee and, at the same time, address the Nation's other \nbusiness, the normal business that comes to this body.\n  But I think if we reflect on the way the Senate has moved ahead over \nthe past 6 months, we will see that even in the heat of an appellate \njudges debate over the springtime we were able to get our business done \nand deliver meaningful solutions for the American people.\n  From lawsuit abuse reform, to trade, to energy policy, we tackled key \nissue after key issue after key issue to make America stronger, to \ncreate jobs, to make America more prosperous, and to make America more \nsecure.\n  Last night, we passed the Homeland Security bill, critical \nlegislation that provides over $31 billion to strengthen America's \nborders, to strengthen our ports and our transit systems from a \nhomeland security standpoint. It will boost our emergency preparedness, \nincluding our first responders. And most importantly, it will \nstrengthen our ability to intercept those who wish to enter this \ncountry and do us harm.\n  The London bombings remind us, once again, of the determination of \nour enemy to strike us here on our own soil and of our responsibility \nto remain vigilant and alert. We are taking action. The Homeland \nSecurity bill we passed last night reflects that appropriate both \nresponse and leadership.\n  When we began the 109th Congress 6 months ago, America faced a number \nof structural problems that were threatening our safety, our security, \nour prosperity, and our freedom. America was drowning in lawsuit abuse. \nOur highways and ports were falling into disrepair. We were hitting our \ntenth year with no comprehensive energy plan, becoming more and more \ndependent, day by day, on foreign sources of oil. Partisan obstruction, \nin large part inherited from the last Congress, was tearing apart our \njudicial confirmation process. Our troops overseas needed our support \nand, over the Christmas holiday period, the tsunami disaster struck. \nLooking at that environment, we needed to take bold action, and we did. \nWe did it by laying out a specific plan. If you review what we have \ndone over the last 6 months and where we are today and where we are \ngoing, we are fulfilling that specific plan.\n  We began by passing the fifth fastest budget in Senate history. That \nallowed us to move on the issues, starting with class action. Frivolous \nlawsuits were so out of control that litigation in America had become \nthe most expensive in the world. In 2003, the tort system alone cost an \nincredible $246 billion, more than the overall economic output of my \nown State of Tennessee. Frivolous lawsuits have a huge impact. They \ndull our competitive edge. They clog up our State courts. They waste \ntaxpayers' dollars, and they lead to outrageous settlements that award \nthe trial lawyers multimillion dollar fees while their clients or the \nvictims get pennies. Reform was long overdue. So we pulled together and \nfinally passed comprehensive class action reform to curb existing \nlawsuit abuse, with nearly three-quarters of this body--bipartisan--\nvoting in favor of that long overdue class action reform, which in the \npast had been locked up, which had become a partisan issue. We broke \nthrough that. One week later, that bill was signed into law by the \nPresident. We delivered in that bill to the American people a victory \nof fairness.\n  With this success at our backs, we moved to bankruptcy abuse. \nBankruptcy reform is another issue that had been locked up for years \nand years. Again, with bipartisanship, similar bills had passed, not \nall the way through Congress, not to become law, but similar bills had \npassed the 105th, 106th, and 107th Congresses. In this Congress, we \npassed the most comprehensive, sweeping overhaul of bankruptcy law in \n25 years, with the purpose of restoring integrity, responsibility, and \nfairness. Like class action, the bankruptcy bill passed this body in \nthis Congress with broad, bipartisan, overwhelming support.\n  I mention all this because I want to thank my colleagues for their \nparticipation, recognizing bills that have been locked up in Congress \nare now being addressed in a way that respects the institution with \ncivility and bipartisan support. There is still a lot we need to do in \nterms of curbing the whole lawsuit abuse culture. Gun liability, I \nmentioned. I have talked to the leadership on both sides of the aisle. \nIt is an issue I would like to address in the next several weeks. We \nhave asbestos reform that is a huge issue, where the victims, patients \nsuch as my former mesothelioma patients or cancer patients, are not \ngetting appropriately compensated because the trial lawyers are running \naway with the settlement money and putting it in their pockets. We have \nto address that reform.\n  We have colleagues who are leaving the medical profession, surgeons \nleaving the practice of medicine because of skyrocketing medical \nliability premiums they simply cannot afford. You can't just pass it on \nto the patients. The patients can't afford it, and it drives up our \nhealth care costs. Plus, it drives my doctor colleagues out of what \nthey love to do; and that is deliver babies or be a neurosurgeon to \nrespond to that traffic accident you might be in.\n  The highway bill was another area where we were able to come together \nand keep America moving forward, another area we were unsuccessful in \nthe last Congress but that we were successful in this Congress. It was \na long process, a bipartisan process, but it was based on more than 3 \nyears of work, over a dozen hearings, testimony from more than 100 \nwitnesses, countless hours of negotiation, supported by a deep and \nbroad coalition from State and local highway authorities to national \nsafety advocates. As every commuter knows, America's roads have become \nlocked up, choked with traffic. In many cities, rush hours now last not \nminutes but, indeed, hours.\n  Worse yet, from a safety standpoint, car crashes are the No. 1 cause \nof death for every age. From 3 to 10 to 15 to 20, 30, up to 33 years of \nage, car crashes are the No. 1 cause of death. Nearly 43,000 people \ndied on our Nation's highways last year. Transportation Secretary Norm \nMineta rightly observed that:\n\n       If this many people were to die from any one disease in a \n     single year, Americans would demand a vaccine.\n\n  This year we responded. This year we were able to provide relief. By \nan overwhelming vote of 91 to 11 in this body, we passed the long \noverdue SAFETEA bill. As communities improve their roads and their \nports, America's drivers will face less time sitting in traffic jams, \nburning up gas, burning up time.\n\n  That brings me to energy. Like the highway bill and the lawsuit abuse \nreform, energy policy had languished in this body for years. For over a \ndecade, we have lacked a comprehensive energy policy. While Congress \nhad been dithering about, we have watched oil prices soar. We watched \nour dependence on foreign sources of oil increase day by day to the \npoint that about 59 percent of our oil is imported. Because of high \nnatural gas prices, manufacturing jobs and chemical jobs have been \nsteadily moving off our shores overseas. Farmers are taking a pay cut. \nConsumers are paying too much to heat their homes, to cool their homes. \nCommunities across the country have been suffering. As many as 2.7 \nmillion manufacturing jobs have been lost because of soaring energy \nprices.\n  All the while, we have had that dangerous dependence on foreign \nsources of oil increase. So we had all this as a backdrop, and we \nresponded. We were finally able to act, and we were able to pass a \ncomprehensive Energy bill. It took 10 years, but we made it. It has \npassed the Senate and House. It is in conference, and I am hopeful. I \nwould like to see it, in the next 2 weeks, come back for the final vote \non the floor of the Senate. It is an energy plan that will make America \nsafer. It will create jobs, and it does make America more secure.\n  Another area where we simultaneously strengthened America's national \nand economic security was the\n\n[[Page S8333]]\n\npassage of the Central American Free Trade Agreement. That agreement, \nwhich President Bush signed in May of 2004, will eliminate most trade \nbarriers between the United States, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Nicaragua, \nGuatemala, Honduras, and the Dominican Republic. New consumers of \nAmerican goods and more sales to Central America mean more jobs at \nhome. It means more shared values.\n  It is fascinating that 20 years ago, only two of the CAFTA nations \nwere established democracies, Costa Rica and the United States. Today, \nall seven can be counted among the free nations of the world. By \nlinking their economies with democratic capitalism, CAFTA will help \nthese nations against the threats posed in their neighborhood, mainly \nVenezuela and Cuba. It will strengthen their democracies and provide a \nmodel for freedom seekers around the world.\n  That does bring me to the world stage. In April, by a near unanimous \nvote, we passed the Emergency Defense War Supplemental and Tsunami \nRelief Act. On the morning of December 26, the world woke up to that \nterrible disaster of the tsunami in Southeast Asia. Deep in the Indian \nOcean, an enormous earthquake, estimated at a magnitude of 9.0 on the \nRichter scale, possibly one of most powerful earthquakes in history, \ncaused a devastating tsunami which killed over 155,000 people, \nseriously injured half a million, and displaced as many as 5 million \nfrom their demolished homes. Thousands of people were literally washed \nout to sea as this enormous wall of water, traveling at speeds of over \n500 miles an hour in the open ocean, struck the coast of that Indian \nOcean realm.\n  As the waves receded, they took with them whole towns and villages. \nIn the face of this terrible tragedy, America took swift action, and we \nresponded on the floor of the Senate. We immediately dispatched \nmilitary ships, planes and helicopters to deliver aid. Twelve thousand \nof our men and women in uniform worked around the clock to reach \nsurvivors, and Americans at home responded through the Internet, \nthrough donations, through their churches, through their mosques, moved \nby the terrible images and stories, and gave millions from their own \npockets to help.\n  I had the opportunity to travel with Senator Landrieu to survey the \ndamage in Sri Lanka. We met with local doctors and local orphanages and \ngovernment officials and nongovernment organizations. We saw firsthand \nthe tragedy and the human suffering the tsunami left. It was clear to \nus at the time exactly what we are seeing now, 6 months later, play \nout. It is going to take months and, indeed, years to respond to this \ntragedy. Many families with the loss of life never will be able to \nrespond.\n  The legislation we passed in April provided an additional $880 \nmillion to help the victims recover and rebuild. The tsunami story may \nno longer be grabbing the headlines, but America is still hard at work \nright now in responding to this disaster.\n  We are also hard at work fighting the war on terror. The emergency \ndefense bill provides $75.9 billion in support for our brave soldiers \nin Afghanistan and Iraq, hunting down the enemy, helping to rebuild and \nto spread freedom and democracy. As the President has reminded the \nNation, we are engaged in an epic struggle. The terrorists want to deny \nthe Iraqi people the freedoms that are the right of all mankind. They \nwant democracy in Iraq to fail so they can seize power, so they can \nspread their poison.\n  But they are not going to succeed. We will win this war. To do so, we \nmust continue to stand together, united in our support of our troops \nand in support of our values. The terrorists are no match for the will \nof the American people, and they are no match for a world that is \nunited against this terror.\n  The dastardly attack on London last week was an attack on the \ncivilized world. I speak for all when I say that America stands \nshoulder to shoulder with the British people. We are in this together. \nTogether we will win.\n  Over the past 6 months, the Senate has shown real leadership \nconfronting a variety of priorities. We also have had some tense and \ndramatic moments; probably none more dramatic than the battle to \nconfirm the President's judicial nominees. We appear to have begun to \nrepair the confirmation process and to restore the dignity and the \nfairness and the respect to our debates over judicial nominees. As we \nhave said all along, each of these candidates was amply qualified and \nenjoyed the majority support of the Senate. Each would be confirmed if \nbrought to the Senate floor, and each of them were--Priscilla Owen, \nJanice Rogers Brown, William Pryor, Richard Griffin, David McKeague, \nTom Griffith--confirmed to the Federal bench.\n  Unfortunately, in the process, they had to endure many unfair attacks \non their character. Some of the nominees in the last Congress found the \nprocess that we put them through so painful that they dropped out and \nsaid: Don't consider me any more. That character assassination is too \nmuch. Therefore, they withdrew from consideration, at a loss for the \nAmerican people. So it is no wonder that we now hear reports that \nsmart, qualified judges don't even want to be considered for the \nFederal bench because of the process. We have put that process behind \nus. So many of them have concluded that Washington is no place to risk \nyour reputation because you may never get it back.\n  As we look ahead to the Supreme Court nomination process, things are \ngoing very well.\n  I do urge my colleagues to make sure that our deliberations are fair \nand dignified and respectful of that nominee when the nominee is \npresented.\n  This last Tuesday, I mentioned that the President is not obligated to \nconsult with Senators before making a nomination. In fact, he is not \nobligated to consult with anyone; consultation is a courtesy, not a \nconstitutional mandate. But the President has reached out to both sides \nof the aisle, the Judiciary Committee, individual Senators, with one-\non-one meetings, and his highest staff are continually listening and \ntaking suggestions. I commend the administration and the President for \nreaching out in an inclusive and bipartisan manner, in a manner that \nreally is unprecedented.\n  Mr. President, let me just say that I believe what we have seen is a \npromising start to what can and should be a thoughtful and \nstatesmanlike debate as we prepare for that nominee coming from the \nPresident for the Supreme Court. In that debate, I want to continue to \nencourage my colleagues to place principle before partisan politics and \nplace results before rhetoric. We owe it to the American people to \nconduct this nominations process, which involves the major institutions \nof our Government, the three grand institutions of justice, \nlegislation, and the executive branch coming together. We owe it to the \nAmerican people to continue to move forward with those meaningful \nsolutions to real problems.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/15/senate-section/article/S8333-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

(a) Certification.--Funds appropriated by this \n     Act that are available for assistance for Colombia may not be \n     made available for demobilization/reintegration of any \n     Colombian-based foreign terrorist organization (FTO) or its \n     members, unless it is for limited activities that are \n     determined by the Justice Department to be consistent with \n     United States anti-terrorism laws, and the Secretary of State \n     certifies to the Committees on Appropriations that:\n       (1) The Government of Colombia has not adopted any law or \n     policy that is inconsistent with its obligations under the \n     United States-Colombian treaty on extradition, and has \n     continued to extradite Colombian citizens to the United \n     States, including members and former members of such FTO's, \n     in accordance with that treaty;\n       (2) The Colombian legal framework governing the \n     demobilization/reintegration of such FTO or its members:\n       (A) provides for effective investigation, prosecution and \n     punishment, in proportion to the crimes committed, of gross \n     violations of humanitarian law and drug trafficking committed \n     by members of such FTO's;\n       (B) conditions sentence reductions for each member of such \n     FTO on a full and truthful confession of his involvement in \n     criminal activity;

and\n       (D) provides that members of such FTO will lose all \n     sentence reductions under the law if they are subsequently \n     found to have withheld illegal assets, lied to the \n     authorities about their criminal activities in the group, \n     rejoined the same or another FTO, or engaged in new illegal \n     activities.\n       (3) An inter-agency working group consisting of \n     representatives from the Drug Enforcement Administration, the \n     Department of Justice, and the Departments of State and \n     Defense has consulted with local and national Colombian law \n     enforcement and military authorities, representatives from \n     the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human \n     Rights in Colombia, and representatives of Colombian civil \n     society organizations, and has independently concluded in a \n     detailed report submitted to the Committees on \n     Appropriations, based on the best information available to \n     the interagency working group, that:\n       (A) the FTO is not violating any ceasefire and has ceased \n     illegal activities, including narco-trafficking, extortion, \n     and violations of international humanitarian law;\n       (B) the FTO's criminal and financial structure is being \n     destroyed and the FTO, or any part thereof, is not regrouping \n     to continue illegal activities;\n       (C) the Government of Colombia is conducting effective \n     investigations and prosecutions of the commanders of the \n     FTO's for crimes, including violations of international \n     humanitarian law, attributable to them, and, when \n     appropriate, extraditing them to the United States;\n       (D) the Government of Colombia is aggressively implementing \n     an effective procedure to locate and confiscate illegal \n     assets, held directly or through third parties, by the FTO \n     and its members, such as land, laboratories, and other assets \n     used for the cultivation, processing, and transportation of \n     illegal narcotics; and\n       (E) the Government of Colombia is enforcing FTO ceasefires \n     by barring individuals who are credibly accused of crimes in \n     breach of any such ceasefire from receiving benefits for \n     demobilization.\n       (b) Consultative Process.--Prior to issuing any \n     certification under this section, the Secretary of State \n     shall consult with internationally recognized human rights \n     organizations and the Office of the United Nations High \n     Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia regarding each of \n     the conditions specified in this section.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Illegal assets.--The term ``illegal assets'' means any \n     and all assets that FTO's or their members possess either \n     directly or through third parties, and that--\n       (A) were acquired through or as a result of criminal \n     activity;

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     regulation, or policy, in determining eligibility for \n     assistance authorized under part I of the Foreign Assistance \n     Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.), foreign nongovernmental \n     organizations--\n       (1) shall not be ineligible for such assistance solely on \n     the basis of health or medical services including counseling \n     and referral services, provided by such organizations with \n     non-United States Government funds if such services do not \n     violate the laws of the country in which they are being \n     provided and would not violate United States Federal law if \n     provided in the United States; and\n       (2) shall not be subject to requirements relating to the \n     use of non-United States Government\n\n[[Page S8372]]\n\n     funds for advocacy and lobbying activities other than those \n     that apply to United States nongovernmental organizations \n     receiving assistance under part I of such Act.\n\n\n                               statement\n\n       Sec. 6112. (a) Funds provided in this Act for the following \n     accounts shall be made available for programs and countries \n     in the amounts contained in the respective tables included in \n     the report accompanying this Act:\n       ``International Fisheries Commission''.\n       ``International Broadcasting Operations''.\n       ``Broadcasting Capital Improvements''.\n       ``Assistance for Eastern Europe and the Baltic States''.\n       ``Assistance for the Independent States of the Former \n     Soviet Union''.\n       ``Global HIV/AIDS Initiative''.\n       ``Foreign Military Financing Program''.\n       ``International Organizations and Programs''.\n       (b) Any proposed increases or decreases to the amounts \n     contained in such tables in the accompanying report shall be \n     subject to the regular notification procedures of the \n     Committees on Appropriations and section 634A of the Foreign \n     Assistance Act of 1961.\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Department of State, Foreign \n     Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2006''.\n         Amend the title so as to read: ``An Act making \n     appropriations for the Department of State, foreign \n     operations, and related programs for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 2006, and for other purposes.''.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me begin my remarks on the \nDepartment of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs \nappropriations bill with a quick word of thanks to Chairman Cochran for \nthe allocation and for additional outlays the subcommittee received. \nWith his support, we are able to recommend a bill that provides $31.7 \nbillion to meet America's foreign assistance needs.\n  The bill provides increased assistance above the budget request for \naccounts that enjoy broad, bipartisan support, including $1.7 billion \nfor the child survival and health programs fund, $1.7 billion for \ndevelopment assistance, $395 million for assistance for Eastern Europe \nand the Baltic States, and $565 million for assistance for the \nindependent states of the former Soviet Union.\n  Understanding the continued importance of combating terrorism, we \nrecommended full funding for assistance for Iraq, Afghanistan, \nPakistan, Israel, Egypt, and Jordan. Significant assistance is provided \nfor State Department operations, including full funding for the \nBroadcasting Board of Governors. We recommend a total of $2.9 billion \nfor HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs, an increase of $203 million \nabove the President's request; $400 million is for a contribution to \nthe Global Fund, twice the amount of the President's request. We \nrecommend $1.8 billion for the Millennium Challenge Corporation, an \nincrease of over $300 million above last year's level but, regretfully, \n$1.2 billion below the request.\n  To demonstrate our strong support of the President's commitment to \nthe promotion of freedom abroad, the bill consolidates democracy \nprograms under a new account entitled, ``Democracy Fund.'' This \nincludes $80 million for the National Endowment for Democracy programs.\n  I encourage Members to come to the floor to offer relevant \namendments. Last year, we were fortunate in being able to finish this \nbill in 5 or 6 hours. So Senator Leahy and I are optimistic that, with \nthe cooperation of our Members, we can complete this bill sometime \neither Monday night or Tuesday morning and allow the Senate to move on \nto other matters that are pressing and need to be dealt with here as we \nmove toward the August recess.\n  With that, I yield the floor. I know my friend and colleague, Senator \nLeahy, will be heard from now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I agree with what the chairman has said. \nThere is no reason we cannot move very quickly on this bill. In fact, I \nencourage anybody who has an amendment to come to the floor because if \nwe reach any point where there is not an amendment pending, I am going \nto be very happy to go to third reading.\n  It has been a long time since we acted on a Foreign Operations \nappropriations bill this early in the year. I thank both Chairman \nCochran and Senator Byrd for that. Again, I say there is no reason we \ncould not pass this bill by tonight or Monday afternoon at the latest. \nI repeat and emphasize that I want those watching, if they have an \namendment, to come forward.\n  Both Senator McConnell and I have worked very hard to accommodate \namendments that both Republicans and Democrats had in this bill. Thanks \nto the budget allocations we had, we were able to accommodate most of \nthe requests we received from Members and do it in a totally bipartisan \nway.\n  Senator McConnell deserves a great deal of credit for producing a \nwell-crafted bipartisan bill. I praise him for that. This may not help \nhim back home--to get this kind of praise from a Democrat--but he \ndeserves it. I don't agree with everything in the bill, but neither \ndoes Senator McConnell. That is why this process works. It is a bill \nthat should receive broad support. We have tried to take into \nconsideration the concerns of Republicans and Democrats. So I thank him \nand his very capable staff for the way they have worked with me and my \nstaff.\n\n  If I might digress for a moment, we read a lot in the press about the \npartisanship in the Congress and how that affects getting our work \ndone. I note that appropriations bills seem to go through the \nsubcommittees, the full committee, and the Senate floor. I think that \nis because the Appropriations Committee, by its nature, has attracted \nmany of the senior members of both the Republican and Democratic \nParties, and we are used to working together with each other.\n  Without sounding like those who reminisce a little bit too much about \nthe good old days, I came here 31 years ago. Senator Mike Mansfield was \nthe Democratic leader, and Senator Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania was the \nRepublican leader. Senior Members of the Senate of both parties worked \nto get things done. That is what we do in the Appropriations Committee. \nWe work together. The country benefits by it.\n  I am not going to talk about all the provisions in the bill. The \nchairman has touched on several of the key accounts. He focused new \nresources on democracy programs, most of which I agree with. He funded \nmost of the President's priorities. We have restored cuts in the \ninternational health and development programs that Members strongly \nsupport.\n  We were not able to fund the Millennium Challenge Corporation at the \nlevel the President wanted. I discussed this with the White House. It \nwill be interesting to see; if it picks up steam and shows positive \nresults, I suspect we are going to provide the funds it needs.\n  The Millennium Challenge Corporation has much in its goals with which \nwe all agree. I think it is fair to say Members on both sides of the \naisle have expressed concern about how slowly it began. There seems to \nbe more effort putting the bureaucracy in place than getting the \nprogram out. I know the President has had similar concerns, and the \nleadership has now changed. I think that is good. It was a concern to \nmany of us that it only was operating in a couple of very small places. \nNow it may go to others.\n  I was in Morocco with several other Senators recently. We saw some of \nthe areas where it might well work. I would like to see it pick up \nsteam and show positive results. In the meantime, however, until it \ndoes, there is no need to set aside huge amounts of money if it is not \ngoing to be used and there are other programs that desperately need \nmoney.\n  The bill, for the first time, contains funds for the State \nDepartment's operations. This used to be under a different \nsubcommittee. Now we have it. We provide the President and Secretary of \nState with much of what they asked--most of what they asked, in fact. \nFor educational and cultural exchanges, which are popular with \nRepublicans and Democrats, we provide even more in the request.\n  Let me mention a few other items. We provide $900 million for \nrefugees, a substantial increase over last year. We felt strongly we \nshould do considerably more for the world's neediest people. One has \nonly to go to some of these refugee camps or hear about them to realize \nhow terrible it is. Unfortunately, we will see them briefly on the \nnews, almost as though this is a filler for the evening news in between \ncelebrity trials in this country. Then we do not see it again, and we \ntend to think the suffering has gone away.\n  In some of these refugee camps, children are being born in the \nmorning and dying in the afternoon--mothers also. People are dying of \ndiseases that would create no problem in this country because we would \nbe immunized against them. They are dying of starvation,\n\n[[Page S8373]]\n\nthey are dying of mistreatment, and it goes on every single day.\n  It is unfortunate that a celebrity trial will get significant \ncoverage on the evening news; the suffering in places such as Darfur \nwill not. We need to appeal to the conscience of this great and good \nNation. Most Americans are appalled by what they see, but many \nAmericans never get to see it because not enough attention is given.\n  We have included $30 million for a new initiative to combat six \ndebilitating diseases such as elephantiasis and intestinal parasites. \nThese cause terrible inflictions for millions of people, many of them \nchildren. We never see these in our country because they are easily \nprevented. They can be cured with minuscule amounts of money, and they \nhave been neglected for far too long.\n  Many of these diseases, especially in Africa, will cause people to be \nalmost condemned to debilitating diseases, children to horrible \nparasites, and yet for sometimes pennies, at the most a few dollars, it \ncan be prevented and their life, their hell on Earth, could be \nprevented.\n  We have included $105 million for antimalaria programs. A portion of \nthat will be used to fund the President's new malaria initiative, which \nI strongly support.\n  We provide another $10 million for USAID's Amazon basin and \nconservation strategy, and we maintain funding for other programs \nprotecting the environment. Again, I urge this money be spent to \nactually do it, that it actually go into the conservation strategy. We \nknow it needs to be done. We do not need to enlarge bureaucracies in \nWashington. We need to be on the ground doing the work.\n\n  We include additional conditions on our assistance to Nepal on \naccount of the Nepalese King's attempts to dismantle the fledgling \ndemocracy there. My key staff member on Foreign Operations, Tim Rieser, \nwas recently in that country. We know the King's decision to dissolve \nthe government, arrest political opponents, and restrict the press is \nmaking a solution to that conflict more elusive, isolating Nepal both \npolitically and economically.\n  We include conditions on funding for the demobilization of foreign \nterrorist organizations in Colombia. The framework that was recently \napproved by the Colombian Congress falls far short of what is minimally \nrequired to dismantle these horrible terrorist organizations.\n  We restore the administration's proposed $11 million cut in our \ncontribution to UNICEF. This saves millions of children's lives. When \nthis country speaks of helping others, why would we be cutting money \nout of UNICEF? It would have been unthinkable to go along with that \ncut.\n  There is a great deal more, and I again commend Senator McConnell for \nwhat I believe is one of the best foreign operations bills in recent \nyears. We are going to have a difficult conference with the other body, \nbut if we get the conference budget allocations we need, we should end \nup with a good result.\n  I hope Senators who have amendments will make sure they belong on \nthis bill; this is not an authorization bill, this is an appropriations \nbill--and bring the amendments as soon as they can.\n  Mr. President, the chairman has stepped off the floor for a moment. I \nam about to suggest the absence of a quorum, but not quite yet. I \nrepeat, if there are Senators who have amendments, come forward with \nthem. I will be very happy to go to third reading--let's see, it is 20 \nminutes of 11. I would certainly be willing to wait 5 or 10 minutes to \nsee if anybody has an amendment. I will be glad to do that. I don't \nthink either side requires a rollcall vote.\n  More seriously, Mr. President, America is the wealthiest, most \npowerful Nation on Earth. It is a nation with a great moral core. We \nsaw that during the terrible tsunami in recent months, when we poured \nout aid from this country, not only our Government but even greater \namounts from individuals. I know in my church and most people's \nchurches, their synagogues, their mosques, there were collections for \nmoney to help aid the tsunami victims. Civic groups, other groups, the \nRed Cross, Catholic Relief Services, and so many others raising money \nin the various service clubs--Lion's, Rotary, Kiwanis--it reflects the \nnature of Americans. We help our neighbors when they are in trouble. We \nhelp our neighbors even when they are on the other side of the globe.\n  So much of what goes on we don't see. We don't see the millions of \nchildren who die each year. We don't see the horrible percentage of \npaternal deaths. We don't see these debilitating and crippling diseases \nthat could so easily be cured. We don't see the need to provide, such \nas Senator Dole and Senator McGovern proposed, a school lunch program \nin many poor parts of the world so not only boys but girls would go to \nschool, too, and thus bring about a positive change in society over the \nyears. We spend well under 1 percent of our budget on help. Frankly, I \nfeel we should do more. I think the American people put forward our \nbest face, and we can do even more.\n  As we eradicate disease, as we eradicate hunger, as we give people an \nopportunity to create their own businesses, sometimes a \nmicroenterprise, we are doing things with which most of the world will \nagree. In a time when we find so many in the world disagree with the \nUnited States--something I, as an American, find very disturbing--let's \nput forward this great face of America, a face I have known from my \nchildhood on and all of us have known all our lives. Let's put forth \nthis great reservoir of goodness and generosity of the American people. \nLet the rest of the world see it. I guarantee, we will find a lot of \nother countries will step up and join us because this is something that \nshould unite us and not divide us from the rest of the world.\n  Mr. President, I see the chairman is back on the floor. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Vermont, it \nhas been a pleasure working with him over the last, gosh, I guess it is \n12 years now, either as chairman or ranking member--we have been here \nlong enough to rotate a couple of times--on this measure. He has made \nan extraordinarily positive contribution every year.\n  We labored mightily to keep this bill as bipartisan as possible. The \nfact that last year we were able to clear it in about six hours \nindicates widespread satisfaction with the measure or we would have had \na lot more action. We realize that is not likely to happen on a Friday \nmorning, but we are intent on moving this matter to completion Monday \nor Tuesday morning at the latest. We hope everyone will cooperate. If \nanyone has a measure, if it is a good idea and warrants consideration, \nshow it to Senator Leahy and myself, and we might agree with you; in \nwhich case, we might be prepared to take the amendments. If not, we \nhope we will have what few votes we expect will be needed Tuesday \nmorning, at the latest, and move on to final passage.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, somewhere out there in our country\n\n[[Page S8374]]\n\ntoday walks the next Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. \nVery soon, this Senate will begin to debate that person's confirmation. \nWe don't know yet the nominee's professional background or experience, \nbut sadly, if the past is any guide, we do know what kind of reception \nthat nominee is likely--likely to receive. That is why I rise to speak \ntoday.\n  No one would argue that some recent Supreme Court confirmation \ndebates have been less than ennobling. But it doesn't have to be that \nway. The experiences of Justices Ginsburg and Breyer by any standard, \ntwo very liberal nominees--when my party was in the minority, prove \nthat we can make Senate confirmation to the High Court a rational and \norderly process. Sadly, whenever the nominees are named by Republican \nPresidents, that doesn't seem to be the case.\n  After recent media reports, I am concerned we may have a circus \nrather than a dignified confirmation process. Specifically, the \nWashington Post reported last week that some of our friends on the \nother side of the aisle have a three-part strategy to defeat the next \nSupreme Court nominee.\n  First, according to the Post, they plan to complain that consultation \nby the President, no matter what the amount, is not sufficient. Second, \nthey plan to paint the nominee as ``extreme.'' Finally, when all else \nfails, they will object that documents produced in relation to the \nnominee are somehow inadequate.\n  I am troubled because we are already beginning to see the first \nsalvos in this three-pronged plan of attack. A week before there was \neven a vacancy, our Democratic colleagues sent a letter to President \nBush demanding that he consult with them. Senator Schumer then \npredicted a ``battle royal'' unless the degree of consultation \nsatisfied him.\n  My good friend from Pennsylvania, the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Specter, expressed the frustration of many of us on \nthis side of the aisle when he went to the floor to appeal for \ncivility. As he said so well, ``It is hardly the time to be looking to \npick a fight.''\n  The fact is, the scope of consultation that President Bush has \nengaged in is unprecedented. Let me repeat: The scope of consultation \nthat President Bush has engaged in is without precedent. He and his \nstaff have reached out to over 60 Senators from both parties \nindividually to solicit their opinions. The President has had meetings \nwith the Democratic leader and the ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee. He has laid his door open to any and all suggestions our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle would care to give. Yet some of \nour Democratic friends now complain that his extensive outreach is not \nenough. They demand that the President give them the names of the \npeople he is thinking about nominating. They want, in effect, to serve \nas co-Presidents by co-nominating a replacement to the Supreme Court.\n  Despite what some on the far left may say, no fair-minded person can \nconclude that President Bush has not adequately consulted with the \nDemocrats. He has done more than the Constitution requires by far, and \nmore than his predecessors did. He has consulted with the Senate. Case \nclosed.\n  Let us now turn to chapter two of the playbook to defeat the nominee: \nDistort and destroy the nominee's record and character. I have been in \nthe Senate for the last seven Supreme Court nominations. Sadly, there \nis a historical pattern of devastating, defamatory attacks on honest \nmen and women who just happen to be nominated to the High Court by \nRepublican Presidents. Take what was said about one current member of \nthe Court. During his nomination hearing, he was denounced for his \n``consistent opposition to women's rights.'' We were told this \nnominee's actions ``revealed an extraordinary lack of sensitivity to \nthe problems women face in the marketplace, as well as an extraordinary \nlack of sensitivity to the Equal Employment Opportunity Act.'' This was \nwhat was said about this current member of the Supreme Court. We were \ntold this nominee had a ``propensity to find against a female \nplaintiff,'' that his judicial decisions ``have flown in the face of \nthe applicable law as duly passed by Congress,'' and his record \n``raises the question of whether he can fairly, judiciously, and \nimpartially review those cases which will reach him as a Justice on the \nSupreme Court.''\n\n  These incredibly harsh criticisms were made by the National \nOrganization of Women. The nominee? Associate Justice John Paul \nStevens, appointed to the Court by President Gerald Ford in 1975. Many \nof Justice Stevens' opinions have brought no small measure of joy to \nthe very same liberal activists who denounced his nomination in such \nextreme terms. Unfortunately, such hyperbolic attacks have been an \nalmost inevitable fate of Supreme Court nominees of Republican \nPresidents. I repeat: that has been the fate of Supreme Court nominees \nof Republican Presidents.\n  Let me give a more recent example regarding another current Justice. \nBefore this person's confirmation hearing, one liberal activist group \nconcluded the nominee's ``opinions and legal briefs threaten to undo \nthe advances made by women, minorities, dissenters, and other \ndisadvantaged groups.'' And during his hearing, this group said it was \n``convinced that [this nominee] will not protect the rights of those \nsuffering discrimination on the basis of race, gender, ethnicity, \nreligion, sexual orientation, or literacy.''\n  Nan Aron of the Alliance for Justice made these accusations. I notice \nMs. Aron's group and more like it are just as ready to pounce on the \nnew nominee today.\n  Who was she talking about? Justice David Souter, appointed to the \nSupreme Court by President George Herbert Walker Bush in 1990. It is \nhard to believe, but true. Such personal invective and histrionics bore \nno rational relationship to Justice Souter's record and, once again, I \ndoubt these same groups would have a problem with Justice Souter today.\n  It wasn't just liberal interest groups who made such sharp criticisms \nof Justice Souter, however. Our colleagues on the other side also \nquestioned Justice Souter's fitness for the Court. For example, the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, said,\n\n       If Judge Souter joins the current closely divided Supreme \n     Court, he will solidify a five-to-four anti-civil rights, \n     anti-privacy majority inclined to turn back the clock on the \n     historic progress of recent decades. If so, literally \n     millions of our fellow citizens will be denied their rights \n     as Americans to equal opportunity and equal justice under \n     law.\n\n  That was Senator Kennedy in 1990, asserting that the Senate's \nconfirmation of Justice Souter actually risked turning back the clock \nand jeopardizing the rights of millions of Americans.\n  We all know that didn't happen. I can only hope that, realizing that, \nmy friends on the other side of the aisle will stop and take a deep \nbreath before attacking the nominee this time around. However, it \nappears these same old groups are singing the same old song. The ink \nwas not even dry on Justice O'Connor's resignation letter when the far \nleft again began ratcheting up the same tired rhetoric, complaining \nthat the ``sky was falling'' courtesy of a Supreme Court appointment by \na Republican President.\n  For example, People for the American Way complained, in its usual \nfashion, that ``our very national identity hangs in the balance.'' And \nMoveOn.org, a group so far out of the mainstream that it promoted a \npacifist response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and yet is a major \nfunding source for Democratic candidates, predicted that the nominee \nwould be an ``extremist who will undermine the rights of individuals \nand families.''\n  These left-wing attack groups are loaded for bear and have one thing \nin common when it comes to a Republican President's nominee for the \nSupreme Court: Their favorite letters in the word ``nomination'' are N-\nO.\n  So that is why I am a bit apprehensive of the impending Supreme Court \nconfirmation. I think this Senate can have a fair, dignified debate \nthat the country will be proud to see. There is no reason we should \nnot. I believe Senators should be passionate in their beliefs and stand \nup for what is right. I am not asking anyone to be muzzled. All I am \nasking for is a little bit of civility, civility and compassion for the \nman or woman who will soon be named to be the next Justice of the \nSupreme Court of the United States. Why don't we try looking at the \nnominee's record? Let's argue the facts. But I urge my friends on the \nother side of the\n\n[[Page S8375]]\n\naisle, don't prejudge. Don't start up the attack machine, don't declare \nwar and begin the reflexive demagoging of qualified Republican \nnominees, regardless of who they are.\n  According to a USA Today article, a recent Gallup Poll found that 86 \npercent--no small majority--86 percent of Americans believe that our \nDemocratic friends will try to block President Bush's Supreme Court \nnominee for ``inappropriate political reasons.'' The public is \nbeginning to see this knee-jerk opposition for what it truly is: \nconfrontation for confrontation's sake.\n  I hope this is not the path we take. According to history, according \nto media reports, according to the overheated rhetoric of the left-wing \nfringe groups that have already began gnashing their teeth, it looks \nthat way. But it doesn't have to be that way. Here is what we should \ndo. We should have a fair process. We should treat the nominees with \ndignity and with respect. And we should have the Court at full strength \nwhen it starts its new term on the first Monday in October, October 3.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/15/senate-section/article/S8375-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE SUPREME COURT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, briefly in response to my friend from \nKentucky, the distinguished majority whip, I agree with him. We should \nhave a civil debate on the Supreme Court nominee. That is going to \nhappen based on what the President has done to this point.\n  He met with me in a one-on-one meeting prior to the resignation of \nSandra Day O'Connor. He called me the day she resigned. There was a \nmeeting this past Monday in the White House with Senator Frist, this \nSenator, and the two leaders of our Judiciary Committee. I thought it \nwas a very good meeting.\n  What happens regarding a Supreme Court nominee is dependent on the \nPresident. From all the indications I have gotten, he does not want a \nbig battle, nor do we. I am hopeful and confident that will be the \ncase.\n  However, I say directly to my friend from Kentucky, there is no \nreason we can't make the October 1 date if the President selects \nsomeone next week or the week after or the week after that. We can have \nthe FBI working. We can have the Judiciary Committee staffs working. \nThe first or second week in September, there can be hearings that last \na week. Everyone can ask all the questions they want. Especially if it \nis a Supreme Court Justice who is one the President thinks, and he \nindicated he would allow us to--certainly I would like to conominate, \nbut I know that is not our purpose in the Senate. He did indicate if \nthere is someone who is deserving of a red flag for reasons that maybe \nhe does not anticipate, we can maybe help in that regard.\n  Keep in mind, Sandra Day O'Connor, being the brilliant woman she is, \nmade her resignation effective upon appointment of her successor. It \nwould be better if we had the new Supreme Court Justice when they begin \ntheir Court hearings in October. We are going to try to do everything \nwe can to cooperate in that regard. If it does not happen, Sandra Day \nO'Connor will still be there. During this period of time, the summer \nmonths, she is still handling her circuit duties, doing everything she \nneeds to do as a member of the Supreme Court. I admire her for not \nmaking the resignation effective upon the President receiving that \nletter. Everyone should cool the rhetoric and see what will happen. The \nball is in the President's court.\n  As has been indicated, a significant number of names were discussed \nwith him. We did not discuss anyone with him in a negative tone. Every \nperson we talked about with him was positive, some of whom he knew, \nsome he knew personally.\n  I am hopeful this will all work out for the good of the country. When \nI say ``good of the country,'' it would be better for everyone--the \nPresident included, the Democrats and Republicans in the Senate--that \nwe did not have a protracted problem in the Senate regarding Sandra Day \nO'Connor's replacement. We would do her honor by having someone move \ninto this position without a lot of problems.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/15/senate-section/article/S8375-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8375-S8377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MISALLOCATION OF SENATE TIME\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend, the distinguished majority \nleader, noted this morning that we have been in session for over 6 \nmonths. That is certainly true. My colleague from Tennessee is correct, \nwe have made progress over these last 6 months.\n  But it is important to the American people that the other side of the \nstory, as Paul Harvey says, is also told. What is that other side of \nthe story? He cited progress we have made but made no mention of the \nwasted time in this Senate on the so-called judicial option, the \nnuclear option. The time we wasted there was multiple weeks. I don't \nknow if anyone has kept an accounting of the exact time, but the rough \ncalculation I have made is more than one-third of the time we have been \nin session--about 89 days--we have devoted all or most of 30 days to \nthat issue. More than one-third of the time we have spent in the Senate \nwas spent on the so-called nuclear option.\n  What did that involve? First of all, we approved, prior to starting, \n208 of the President's nominees and turned down 10. The President, as \nsoon as he was reelected, renominated 7 of the 10 we turned down. Three \nof the individuals decided they did not want to be judges or they did \nnot want to go through the process. One of the judges retired who the \nPresident recess appointed. We spent more than one-third of the \nSenate's time on seven judges.\n  From the very beginning of the President's reelection, we said with \ntwo of them, there is no problem, the two Michigan judges. No problem \nwhatever. Just bring them here, we will vote on them, and they can go \nthrough.\n  The reason they were turned down earlier is because of all the \nproblems in the past when the majority at that time--the Republicans \nsometimes were in the minority; it flipped back and forth; but they \nwould not allow some judges who came from Michigan. It was a procedural \nproblem. Upon the President's reelection, we said: You have those two \nMichigan judges. So we have spent one-third of the Senate's time on \nfive people, five nominees.\n  These people could be members of the President's family, but would \nyou spend one-third of the Senate's time on that while leaving \nimportant issues dealing with this body alone, ignoring them and \nrejecting them? I don't think so. But these were not members of the \nPresident's family but people who wanted to be judges. What did it \namount to when we finished? Out of the five, three have been chosen as \njudges, two were not. It boiled down to three people. That is what it \namounts to. I don't think that is a good allocation of our time, and \nthat is a gross understatement.\n  Not a single day have we spent in this Senate dealing with health \ncare--not a debate on health care, let alone legislation. I don't think \nwe can find a person anyplace in America who would not say, Boy, this \nproblem with health care is significant. Why do they feel that way? \nBecause 45 million Americans have no health care, and millions more are \nunderinsured, meaning they have insurance but it is not very good. This \nproblem is affecting the very core of our society.\n  Employers know their employees are happier and they are better \nemployees when they have health insurance. Why did these employers not \nhave health insurance for their employees? They are not mean. They are \nnot miserly. They have no health insurance because they cannot figure \nout a way to get it. With the present state of our society, employers \nall over America cannot buy health insurance. Once they buy it, it is \ncanceled if someone gets sick or is in an accident. It is a problem we \nshould be spending time on. Ignoring it does not do the trick.\n  Education. I have said in the Senate, and I will say it again, I met \nsome time ago with all 17 superintendents of schools of the State of \nNevada. We have a wide range of sizes of our school districts. The \nClark County school district, Las Vegas, has about 300,000 students. It \nis one of the largest school districts in all of America. That was\n\n[[Page S8376]]\n\none of the 17 with whom I met. One of the 17 is from Esmeralda County, \nGoldfield. That whole school district has 88 students. So 300,000 \nversus 88, and in between we have different size school districts.\n  All 17 superintendents, without exception, when they walked into that \nmeeting with me--I didn't ask if they were Democrats, Republicans, or \nIndependents--all 17 told me, as we went around the room, spending \nabout an hour and 45 minutes together, that the Leave No Child Behind \nAct is destroying public education in Nevada. I didn't make this up. \nThat is what they told me. It must be a problem. The State of Utah, our \nneighbor, has dropped out of the program. But we have not spent time in \nthe Senate talking about education--not a single day on education \nlegislation.\n  Not a single day have we talked about minimum wage. Minimum wage is a \nvery important issue. We have people in Nevada working two and three \njobs in the service industry, earning minimum wage, trying to make a go \nof it. It became so pronounced in Nevada that the State of Nevada, \nwhich is known as a pretty conservative State, raised the minimum wage. \nNow the legislature has to vote again. We are going to put that in our \nconstitution because the Federal Government has not lived up to its \nexpectation.\n  There are many issues we need to deal with in the Senate. These are \nissues the majority leader failed to talk about when he was here today. \nHe talked about some of the things we have done, and we have worked \nclosely. Everyone knows I like to have the trains run on time. It is \nhard for me to get over that. It is difficult for me to want to slow \nthings down. I have lived on this Senate floor for 6 years, and I want \nas much order as we can have in the Senate. We have worked hard to try \nto cooperate.\n  Even though all Democrats did not support the bankruptcy bill, it \npassed, working through the process. Same with the class action \nlegislation. But some of the things we have passed have not been good \nfor the country.\n  My distinguished friend, the majority leader, talked about the \nbudget. In this Senate, right before the vote, I read a letter from the \nleaders of the Lutheran Church, the Methodist Church, the Episcopal \nChurch, the Church of Christ, and others. It was their letter, not \nmine. They said the budget that was about to be passed--and now is law \nbefore this country--was an immoral document. These are church leaders.\n  I met recently with the leader of all the bishops of the Catholic \nfaith in my office in Washington. They are very concerned about what is \nhappening to the poor, the oppressed in this country with the budgetary \nfolks. They have addressed that to the White House. This budget passed \non trillions of dollars of debt to our children, and at the expense of \nthem the wealthiest in this country did much better in this budget.\n\n  We have staggering debt in this country. A press conference was held \na couple of days ago by the President and others bragging about the \ndeficit not being so big. The budget the President submitted--now we \nfind the midterm report shows it is going to be the third largest debt \nin the history of this country, only surpassed by two other Bush \nbudgets. And if he added in the disguise he has in this budget where he \ndoes not count the Social Security surplus, the debt would be about \n$600 billion, the deficit for this 1 year. We have not talked about \nthis issue.\n  I see in the Senate today my friend from the State of North Dakota. \nNo one, bar none, has spoken more about another problem we do not \naddress in this Senate and the majority leader failed to mention, which \nis the trade deficit. There was almost a celebration held yesterday \nregarding the trade deficit this past month which was ``only'' $55 \nbillion--only $55 billion. I am not misspeaking, I am not saying \n``billion'' when it should be ``million.''\n  I don't think we need to brag about the fact we passed CAFTA, which \nwill just make it even bigger. The Catholic Church in Honduras and \nother places in Central America where CAFTA is going to apply opposed \nit. Labor unions will oppose it because it is unfair to the working men \nand women of that part of the world. We should not brag about CAFTA. We \nshould talk about trade policy.\n  Yes, we passed an energy bill, and I appreciate the limited support \nwe got from my friends on the other side of the aisle. It is better \nthan the House bill, but still it is a very bad bill. It is better than \nthe House bill, no question about it.\n  We are going to march to conference, and I have agreed to let my \nfolks go to conference on the Energy bill. I hope we can hang on to \nwhat we have. Even though it is not very good, it is so much better \nthan the sellout, for lack of a better word, to my folks on the other \nside of the aisle for the major oil companies. We must still make it \nthrough conference where House Republicans remain determined to strip \naway the good the Senate did and insert giveaways, protections for big \nenergy corporations and chemical companies.\n  We just finished Homeland Security appropriations. I respect the work \nof my friend Judd Gregg and Senator Byrd, the chairman of the \nsubcommittee. We cannot brag about this. I am glad it is finished, but \nkeep in mind, this bill we have in the Senate came with a \nrecommendation from the President to cut spending for first-line \nresponders by about $412 million.\n  But when my friends in the majority got finished with it, the amount \nof money taken from first-line responders, in the bill, totaled $492 \nmillion less than last year. We have thousands of police stations, \nthousands of fire stations filled with police officers and fire \nfighters, ambulances, medical responders, and this Homeland Security \nbudget took money away from them. There were efforts made on the floor \nyesterday by members of the Republican Party, the majority, to take \nmoney from the budget, and it was literally to rob Peter to pay Paul. \nThank goodness those amendments did not pass.\n  So we cannot brag about what we are doing in homeland security. For \ntransit, it was a little better, and I am happy to see that. But there \nare so many things we need to do that are not being done. We have \nchemical plants with no protection, nuclear power generating facilities \nwith no protection. We are unable, in the State of Nevada, to respond \nto each other, one police agency with another police agency. But it is \nnot only Nevada. It is all over the country.\n  So as we look back on these 7 months we have been in session, more \nthan a third of it was devoted to three people who are now judges. We \nhave done nothing with retirement security, even though we had the \nscandal with United Airlines. Pensions and savings are going downhill.\n  Stem cell research: I know we are tying to work something out, and I \nappreciate and admire what the majority leader, a physician, is trying \nto do on that. I appreciate his help. We still have not done it yet.\n  The defense authorization, we have not done that. We have been in \nsession, as I have indicated, for 19 weeks. It is a blemish on this \nSenate's record that we are 80 percent completed as to the work period \nthis year and we have done about 10 percent of the work we need to do. \nWith only 6 weeks left until the target adjournment, we have done \nvirtually nothing for the American people. It is no wonder the American \npeople have lost confidence in the Republican leadership in this \nCongress.\n  We brag about the bankruptcy bill. Who is that for? It is not for the \ncommon working men and women in this country. It is for banks and big \ncredit card companies.\n  Class action legislation: That is not for the American consumers. It \nis for big business.\n  So at this time now, we have to turn our attention to a Supreme Court \nnominee. As I have indicated, when it comes to that nominee, I hope the \nPresident will use this opportunity to bring the country together. We \nreally need that, as President Reagan did when he nominated Sandra Day \nO'Connor. By choosing a consensus nominee, that can be done. It has \nbeen done, and we need it so badly today. We need to move away from the \npartisanship and back to the commonsense center, not just on judges but \non all the work we do in the Senate.\n  The American people sent us to work for them. They have not seen very \nmany results in the first 7 months of this session. But in the weeks \nahead, I hope we can change that. I am happy to work with my \ncounterpart and move forward. I want the trains to run on\n\n[[Page S8377]]\n\ntime. But this was a subject brought up by the distinguished majority \nleader, and I felt it was appropriate to answer. I have done the best I \ncan in responding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/15/senate-section/article/S8377-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

Mr. President, to follow up on one of the \nthings we did accomplish in the Senate, passing last night the \nDepartment of Homeland Defense appropriations bill, I want to call to \nthe attention of the Senate three amendments this Senator from Florida \nhad attached to the bill which were passed. They regard FEMA, the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency. This, of course, has been \nextremely important to the Nation, but particularly to my State of \nFlorida, having gone through the experience of four hurricanes last \nyear within a 6-week period.\n  Originally, FEMA did a very good job. A lot of that was as a result \nof the lessons we had learned from a decade previously from the monster \nhurricane of 1992, Hurricane Andrew, when one level of Government was \nnot talking to another level. Those lessons learned were applied. \nIndeed, in the immediate aftermath of those four hurricanes that hit \nFlorida within that 6-week period, FEMA responded, and responded well, \nworking with the State of Florida and the local governments, which in \nthis case for those four hurricanes included most of the counties of \nFlorida. Little did I know, going into August a year ago, I was going \nto end up visiting almost every emergency operations center in the \nState of Florida. But that is the fate that befell our State.\n\n  But then, in the long run, FEMA started dropping the ball. It was not \nbecause they did not have enough money. We appropriated $13.5 billion--\nthat is with a ``B''--for hurricane relief. Of that $13.5 billion, $8.5 \nbillion went to FEMA. It was not that it did not have enough money. But \nthey started sending it to the wrong places. They sent over $30 million \nto Miami-Dade County, when in fact the hurricane winds never blew in \nMiami-Dade County.\n  So one of the amendments has to do with them being required, under \nlaw, to report back to the committee in the Senate and the committee in \nthe House on all of the changes they have made in response to the \nrecent inspector general's report that named all of these deficiencies \nin FEMA. One of them was sending millions of dollars into a county \nwhere the hurricane winds did not blow.\n  Another example was they paid for over 300 funerals, but the number \nof deaths directly attributable or even indirectly attributable to the \nhurricane was about 125. Why are we paying for that?\n  Over and over--I cannot tell you how many county commissioners and \nmayors were calling us, pleading: Why won't FEMA reimburse us for the \ndebris removal? Over and over we had people saying: FEMA is not sending \nus any relief.\n  What is the purpose of FEMA? It is to help people when they are in a \ntime of need and it is authorized under law.\n  Well, lo and behold, do you know what the most recent one is? It is \nexactly the reverse. Just a month ago, FEMA sent out $27 million in \npayments to people; and now, as of 2 weeks ago, it is demanding the \npeople send it back. They said they made a mistake, that they were not \neligible for that--$27 million?\n  Well, thank goodness the Governmental Affairs Committee of the \nSenate, at my request, had an investigation and a hearing. They allowed \nthe senior Senator from Florida to be the leadoff witness. Of course, I \nchronicled a number of these instances.\n  So we attached to the legislation that passed last night--the \nDepartment of Homeland Security appropriations bill--amendments that \nwill require FEMA to report back to these committees on the changes \nthat have been made in response to these deficiencies that were noticed \nby the Inspector General's report.\n  But we also put on an amendment that will require FEMA to issue \nconsistent and uniform guidelines for the local governments regarding \ntheir reimbursement for hurricane debris removal. This was what was so \nfrustrating to our local governments because in one county FEMA would \nreimburse the local government for the debris removal and in another \ncounty it would not. You had this inconsistency. So in our oversight of \nthe executive branch, it is our responsibility to make it. I am happy \nto say we passed this on this bill.\n  The third amendment was just a commonsense amendment. Do you know \nwhat happened? Last year, they were hiring inspectors to go into homes. \nThe inspector general's report pointed out that those inspectors did \nnot have very much training. Therefore, they were just writing checks \nleft and right, not knowing what they were doing. They would write, for \nexample, a reimbursement for a demolished house and all the \naccoutrements and complete furnishings, but, in fact, that house did \nnot have any furnishings. If the inspector had asked, FEMA would have \nknown. Well, that is going to be dealt with, with the amendment, with \nthem coming back and reporting on the inspector general's report.\n  But do you know what else happened? FEMA allowed inspectors to go in, \nexamine a house, and make a determination. But, lo and behold, they \nthen came back, and those inspectors bought those houses at bargain \nbasement prices, when the homeowner was desperate for cash, at below \nfair market value. The inspector was profiting as a result of the \ninspector having been hired, representing the U.S. Government, FEMA, to \ngo in there and help the people, and then coming around and taking \nadvantage of the people in their depleted condition.\n  So we added an amendment, last night, that is going to prohibit those \ninspectors from entering into contracts with people when they inspect \ntheir property. It is common sense.\n  There is one thing more I want to inform our colleagues in the \nSenate. When I arrived at the emergency operations center in the State \nof Florida Sunday afternoon, just before the hurricane hit--at the time \nwhen it was about 3 hours out from landfall, it was a category 4--we \nthought the poor people of Pensacola were going to be absolutely \ndevastated again from the effects they had 10 months ago with Hurricane \nIvan, when it hit with such ferociousness. Well, in those intervening \nhours, by landfall, it had come down from a category 4 to a category 2. \nBy the way, the differential between 145 miles an hour and 125 miles an \nhour does not sound like much--that is 20 miles an hour--but the \ndifferential is exponential in its destructive force. When I arrived at \nthe emergency operations center--and we were so apprehensive--\nimmediately, several people in the State of Florida EOC came up to me \nand said: Senator, we want to thank you for standing up and opposing \nlegislation that has been filed in the Senate.\n  It is legislation that was referred to our Senate Commerce Committee, \nlegislation that would require the National Weather Service to take \ntheir Web site off the Internet, under the legislation filed, if there \nis a competing weather service offered by a commercial entity.\n  In this particular legislation, it is a commercial entity in the \nState of the Senator who offered the legislation called AccuWeather. \nWhat those people in the Florida EOC wanted me to know was that \nAccuWeather, on Saturday before the hurricane hit on Sunday, had been \npredicting it was going in to New Orleans or Mississippi, whereas the \nNational Weather Service, through the National Hurricane Center, had \nthat track coming straight to an area between Pensacola and Ft. Walton \nBeach, exactly the track where the hurricane hit.\n  If we had not had the National Weather Service accuracy available to\n\n[[Page S8378]]\n\nthe public of Florida--and they were getting their information from \nthis other entity--the people of the gulf coast of Florida would have \nlet down their guard and then, all of a sudden, they would have gotten \nhit. There was a lot less destruction this time and, thank the good \nLord, no loss of life because people heeded the warnings: Get out. The \nday before the hurricane, there was a massive evacuation, very orderly. \nWe did not lose one life.\n  Here again is another reason why we can be thankful we do have such \nexperts. And never, under the guise of privatization, should we say a \ngovernmental service that often is the difference between life and \ndeath in my State of Florida should be knocked off the Internet. To the \ncontrary, I can tell you last year, the National Weather Service Web \nsite got 9 billion--that is with a ``b''--hits in that 6-week period. \nIt is a governmental service I am proud of, and I am proud of all the \npeople at the National Hurricane Center in Miami. I have called Max \nMayfield, the director, to tell him how proud I am of all those people. \nThey were right on. We never want to focus on that centerline of the \ntrack because Mother Nature has a mind of her own. We want to focus on \nthat cone of possible landfall. But in this case, the National \nHurricane Center was right on track. My congratulations to them.\n  I thank my colleagues for the passage of these amendments regarding \nFEMA last night on the Department of Homeland Security appropriations \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dorgan pertaining to the introduction of S. 1412 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/15/senate-section/article/S8378-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                TV MARTI\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I point out an amendment I will offer to \nthe Foreign Operations appropriations bill. Let me show a picture of \nsomething called Fat Albert. Fat Albert is an aerostat balloon. It is \non a tether far up in the sky. The purpose of Fat Albert is to \nbroadcast television signals into the country of Cuba to tell the \ncitizens of Cuba that life under Castro, life in communism in Cuba, is \na pretty awful life and you ought to aspire toward a democracy and here \nare all the good things democracy has to offer.\n  The fact is, the Cubans already know all that. That is why they get \non rafts and risk their lives trying to leave. In any event, if they \ndon't know that, they can tune into a Miami radio station 90 miles \naway. If they choose not to tune in to a Miami radio station, they can \ntune in to Radio Marti. That does work. It sends signals to the country \nof Cuba and people listen to it. But TV Mart does not work.\n  TV Marti doesn't get into the Cuban marketplace. The Cuban people \ncan't see it, because the Castro regime jams the signals. We have now \nspent $189 million on TV Marti. We send television signals the Cuban \npeople can't see. We spend $189 million. Apparently, someone feels \nbetter because we have wasted this money.\n  I had an amendment earlier this year to shut this down. Strangely \nenough, this Senate turned it down. I will give them the chance again \non the Foreign Operations bill. I am going to take the money out of \nthat bill, and we will vote on it again.\n  Why do the Cubans not see these signals? Because Castro jams them. \nThe President is asking for $21 million more to send television signals \nto Cuba. They used to use Fat Albert. Fat Albert got loose at one \npoint, meandered over into the Everglades. They had to find some \ngrapple hooks to rescue him. But that wasn't enough.\n  Incidentally, for most of the time they have broadcast these signals, \nthey broadcast them from 3:30 a.m. until 8:30 a.m. All were jammed. \nThey decided to change that on May 20, 2002, and then they began to \nbroadcast in prime time. An administration official from the State \nDepartment said this: We don't have any official evidence that the \naudience has increased due to the broadcast schedule change.\n  Chris Coursen, former chairman of the President's board of advisors \non broadcasting to Cuba, says until 6 years ago, TV Marti used to do \nexit interviews with Cubans coming to the United States on rafts and so \non to determine whether Cubans, in fact, watched TV Marti. It was clear \nfrom those interviews no one was seeing TV Marti in Cuba because Castro \nwas jamming it. We get people coming off a raft. We say: Have you \nwatched Television Marti? No, we can't see it. It gets jammed. What do \nwe do? We keep spending money anyway. And they stopped doing exit \ninterviews with Cubans coming here, because they didn't want to \ndocument the fact that nobody could watch TV Marti.\n  It is now not enough to do it by an aerostat balloon. We now have a \nspecially equipped airplane flying once a week, a C-130, Commando Solo, \nwhich is a very special airplane designed for communications strategies \nin warfare. We have taken an Air National Guard Commando Solo, put it \nup 4 hours a week, and it still cannot overcome the jammers in Cuba. We \nwent from spending money we don't have on things we don't need to send \ntelevision signals to people who can't receive them, and then we went \nto airplanes.\n  Now the President wants to buy an airplane just for this purpose, buy \na new one. The President wants to spend $21 million more sending a \ntelevision signal no one can see. It is unbelievable. I want to see \nsomebody vote to continue this funding and then go home and thumb their \nsuspenders and crow about how they oppose Government waste. I want to \nsee one person do that. If ever there was a demonstrated waste in \nGovernment, this is it. Everybody in this Chamber knows it. We will see \nwhether finally this Senate will decide to shut down money that is \nspent that unwisely.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/15/senate-section/article/S8378-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8378-S8379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MASSIVE WASTE OF TAXPAYER MONEY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am going to offer one other amendment on \nthe Foreign Operations appropriations bill. I will offer it on every \nappropriations bill I get the chance to offer it on. It is legislating \non appropriations, but it is important to do.\n  We have held hearing after hearing on the subject of Halliburton and \nother contractors in Iraq. There is massive waste of the taxpayers' \nmoney. The most recent hearing talked about a whistleblower who worked \nfor Halliburton in a food service enterprise in a supervisory capacity \nin Iraq. He said: We were serving food to American troops that had \nexpired and outdated stamps on it by as much as a year. We were told to \nfeed it to the troops. There was food in convoys that came under fire, \nand the food was contaminated with bullets and shrapnel. We were told \nto take out the bullets and shrapnel, and feed the food to the troops \nanyway.\n  He also said--with respect to when he worked for Halliburton we were \ntold if we spoke to a government auditor who came to our base, we would \nbe fired or sent to an area to work where there is an active fire zone. \nAnd this in fact happened to him.\n  This isn't just this hearing. It is not just feeding outdated food to \nthe troops. It is about people who have testified, whistleblowers who \nhave testified at previous hearings and said: We drove $85,000 new \ntrucks, and we left them on the side of the road. If they had a flat \ntire or a plugged fuel pump, they got torched. We would just leave them \nbehind. It was a cost plus contract, so there was no need to fix these \nlittle problems. Just buy new trucks, and make a nice little profit on \nthe new purchase.\n  The stories of waste and fraud and abuse are unbelievable, and nobody \ncares.\n  Anybody hear of any oversight hearings by the oversight committees of \njurisdiction in the U.S. Senate? None, zero. That is why we are holding \nthe hearings I am chairing in the Policy Committee, because no one here \ncares.\n  I just sent a letter to Secretary Rumsfeld to say please at least \nlook into this question of whether we are sending men and women in \nAmerica's uniform to Iraq to fight and serving food that is outdated by \nas much as a year. Unbelievable.\n  Bunny Greenhouse testified at the hearing. She is the highest ranking \ncivilian official in the Corps of Engineers, and is responsible for \napproving large contracts. She always got excellent scores on her \nperformance evaluations. But they didn't like her much when she began \nto interfere with the\n\n[[Page S8379]]\n\nsweetheart deals given to Halliburton--no bid--under circumstances she \nobjected to. She said:\n\n       I can unequivocally state that the abuse related to \n     contracts awarded to KBR [Halliburton] represents the most \n     blatant and improper contract abuse I have witnessed during \n     the course of my professional career.\n\n  Will someone investigate? Who will investigate? The answer is no one. \nSo I am going to propose, as I have previously, a Truman-type \ncommittee. Harry Truman, a Democratic Senator from Missouri, when we \nhad a Democrat in the White House, said: I am going to investigate \nwaste, fraud, and abuse in the military. And he found it.\n  We need an investigation here, and we should have a special committee \nof the type of the Truman committee. I will offer that amendment once \nagain.\n  We cannot sit idly by and suggest nothing wrong is happening. This is \nserious. It ought to be taken seriously. It undermines, in my judgment, \nthose who fight the wars, the men and women who wear America's uniform \nand go, when asked by the Government, to fight. The least we can do is \nmake certain they are not being fed outdated food, that contractors are \nnot shortchanging them in a range of ways, and make sure the taxpayer \nisn't being bilked.\n  We have had testimony about how we paid to put an air conditioner in \na building in Iraq, and then it goes to a subcontractor, and eventually \ngoes to another subcontractor, and another one, and pretty soon that \nroom gets a fan and we get charged for an air conditioner. The American \ntaxpayer just gets shafted, and our troops are ill served.\n  There is so much waste, fraud, and abuse that it is unbelievable.\n  I will offer these amendments: on the issue of the Truman committee, \non the issue TV Marti, and also I may offer my amendment on the issue \nof the purchase of Unocal by CNOOC.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/15/senate-section/article/S8379-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SEXUAL PREDATORS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to mention an issue dealing with \nsexual predators. We are now hearing, as I did this morning on the \nnews, more information about Mr. Joseph Duncan. He is a violent sexual \npredator. He raped a young boy at gunpoint and went to prison for 20 \nyears for that crime. He was then released, and went to live in North \nDakota. Duncan has now been charged in Idaho with multiple counts of \nmurder and with the abusing of two young children that he kidnapped.\n  This is a man who, just some months ago, in the month of April, was \nhauled into an American court in the State of Minnesota, charged with \nmolesting a 6-year-old boy, having had the record of violently raping \nat gunpoint a teenage boy some long while before. But we are told that \nthe judge in Minnesota did not know this person's previous history. So \nafter walking into a Minnesota courtroom, being charged with molesting \na 6-year-old, despite his previous history, Mr. Duncan was allowed to \npost $15,000 bail and was gone. Now children have been abused and \nkidnapped by this violent sexual predator. People are dead.\n  I have introduced a bill called Dru's law. I will put up a picture of \nthis beautiful, young woman, Dru Sjodin. She walked outside of a \nshopping center in Grand Forks, ND, one night and, similarly, a violent \nsexual predator, Mr. Rodriguez, allegedly abducted her and murdered \nher.\n  Let me tell you about Mr. Rodriguez. Mr. Rodriguez is a man who \nserved 23 years in prison for a violent sexual crime. When released, he \nwas judged by the psychiatrist and psychologist to be at the highest \nrisk for reoffending. He was let out of prison after 23 years. No \nmonitoring at all. At the prison door, it is: So long, see you, hope \nyou do well.\n  Within 6 months, this man allegedly abducted and murdered this \nwonderful young woman, a student at the University of North Dakota.\n  Now, Martha Stewart went to prison, and when she was let out, she was \nrequired to wear an electronic bracelet around her ankle so that they \nknew her whereabouts. I believe she still wears an electronic bracelet. \nBut Joseph Duncan didn't wear an electronic devise. And Mr. Rodriguez \ndidn't wear an electronic device.\n\n  What is happening in this country--especially with violent sexual \npredators--is just shameful. We know what causes this, who does it. In \nmost cases, they have been in the hands of law enforcement and the \ncriminal justice system and they have been let out. We know also that \nover 70 percent of the violent sexual predators will reoffend and, in \nmost cases, will reoffend more violently.\n  As a result of that, some long while ago, I introduced Dru's law, \nnamed after this young woman, Dru Sjodin. It would do three things: \nOne, establish a national registry of sexual predators. There is not \nnow one. There are State registries, but there is no national registry \nthat you can search to find out who lives near you, regardless of state \nlines.\n  Second, if a high-risk sex offender is about to be released from \nprison, there must be notification of the local State attorneys so they \ncan, if they wish, seek additional civil commitment and incarceration.\n  Third, if a high-risk offender is, in fact released, they must have \nhigh-level monitoring upon release. We just cannot allow these people--\nthe violent sexual predators--to end their term, or to come into court \non a new charge and to walk back out on the sidewalks to terrorize \nother innocent Americans.\n  The Senate passed Dru's law last fall. It didn't get through the \nHouse, so I have to start over. I am proud to tell you that Arlen \nSpecter, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, is a cosponsor, and Orrin \nHatch, the previous chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has been very \nsupportive of this bill. We have bipartisan cosponsorship. I hope next \nweek we will, by consent, move Dru's law through the Senate again and \nsend it to the House. We must address these issues.\n  In April, I held a town meeting about the issue of sexual predators \nin Fargo, ND, which, coincidentally, is where Mr. Duncan was living. I \ncalled up on the North Dakota Registry of Sexual Predators for the \nnames of these people living within 2 miles of where I was having the \nmeeting. I told the people at the meeting I want to know that there is \nthis violent offender within blocks of where we are holding this \nmeeting. Here is what I had. I had this piece of paper. I told them \nabout this sexual predator, and his rape of a 14-year-old boy at \ngunpoint and the burning of his victim.\n  The fact is, this man was not some stranger with no record.\n  Then Mr. Duncan went to court on the charge of molesting a 6-year-old \nboy in another state, and was allowed to post $15,000 bail because the \njudge apparently wasn't aware of his record. The judge should certainly \nhave been apprised of his record.\n  In fact, we cannot any longer--from California, to Texas, to Florida, \nto Idaho, to North Dakota--continue to see violent sexual predators let \nout of prison in circumstances that are so much more lenient than that \nwhich was required of Martha Stewart when she finished her \nincarceration. That makes no sense.\n  Mr. President, I hope that next week perhaps we will have the \nopportunity by consent to move the legislation, with the support and \nactive cosponsorship of Arlen Specter, chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, and also with the support of Senator Hatch, Senator Leahy, \nand many others. If we do this, I think we will send hope to all of \nthose who have asked this Congress to take action to do the right \nthing. I hope that perhaps by this day next week, I am able to say we \nhave been successful in moving that legislation and, hopefully, we can \nmove it to the House and get the President to sign this very important \npiece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/15/senate-section/article/S8379-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8379-S8381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           VIOLENCE IN CONGO\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I want to call attention to and condemn \nthe recent deplorable violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. \nLast Saturday, almost 50 people, mostly women and children, were quite \nliterally burned alive in eastern Congo because of their support for \nthe U.N. peacekeeping mission there. While many of the men in the \nvillage fled, the victims--again, the vast majority\n\n[[Page S8380]]\n\nwomen and children--were herded into huts and locked inside while the \nhuts were then set on fire.\n  The perpetrators of this heinous act were Rwandan rebels who, after \nthe 1994 genocide in Rwanda, fled to the eastern Congo to avoid \nprosecution for their genocidal actions. Since then, they have roamed \nthe eastern Congo with impunity, spreading death and misery in their \nwake.\n  During Saturday's brutal massacre, the rebels taunted their victims, \ntelling them to call on their U.N. saviors to rescue them. ``Call on \nyour U.N. saviors if you want to be rescued,'' they said. But the \nproblem was that the U.N. peacekeepers were not there. They were not \nthere when those women and children needed them the most.\n  We have to condemn the rebels. What they did was indescribably \nbrutal. But we, also, in the international community have a \nresponsibility to protect the victims, and the international community \nfailed. We have sent the world's largest U.N. peacekeeping mission into \nthe Congo. Yet the violence and instability continues. Sexual scandals \nin the Congo and elsewhere show that peacekeepers cannot be trusted \nwith the very people they are designed to protect. In addition, \npeacekeepers often avoid danger, abdicating the responsibility to \nprotect at the very moment they are most needed. I don't want my \ncolleagues in the Senate to think this is an isolated critique of the \nU.N. peacekeeping mission in the Congo which, in its defense, has been \nmore active in the past few months. This is really an endemic problem, \nas shown by the 1995 massacre of some 8,000 men and boys in Bosnia by \nthe Bosnian Serb army. The U.N. peacekeeping force was simply unable to \nprotect them. Because of the U.N. peacekeeping mission's failure, 8,000 \ninnocent people lost their lives.\n  Mr. President, I can also speak at length about the current failures \nof U.N. peacekeeping in Haiti.\n  In Haiti, despite a robust U.N. peacekeeping mission that is twice as \nlarge as the successful multinational force that includes United States \ntroops that kept the peace immediately following President Aristide's \ndeparture, today violence and chaos reign in Haiti. U.N. peacekeepers \nin Haiti are called turistas because they are found more often on the \nbeaches or in local restaurants and bars than actively protecting the \npeople of Haiti.\n  The U.N. originally argued the problem was more troops were needed. \nBut the quantity is not the problem in Haiti, nor in the Congo. As I \nmentioned before, Congo hosts the world's largest U.N. peacekeeping \nforce, and the U.N. peacekeeping force in Haiti is twice as large as \nthe contingent of United States, French, and Canadian soldiers who were \nvery effectively able to keep the peace immediately after Aristide \nleft. The problem then is quality. The problem is what they are doing. \nThe problem is what they are not doing.\n  I certainly do not want to imply all peacekeepers are doing a bad or \ninadequate job. There are many brave individuals who make up the \npeacekeeping forces. Some countries certainly have an exemplary \nreputation for sending competent peacekeepers, but there are far too \nfew quality peacekeepers. It is inconsistent.\n  The bottom line is the United Nations needs to take a long, hard \nlook, and that all countries in the international community need to \ntake a long, hard look at the peacekeeping missions to ensure that \nevery peacekeeper in every peacekeeping mission is willing to protect \nand engage.\n  ``Protect and engage'' should be the motto of the U.N. because no \ninternational mandate is more important than the responsibility to \nprotect innocent civilians.\n  We know, of course, the United States cannot afford to send U.S. \ntroops--certainly the best in the world--to every single conflict in \nevery single region. That is why we have U.N. peacekeepers, for which \nwe pay a significant amount of money. We pay a significant percentage \nof the cost of U.N. peacekeepers.\n  We have peacekeepers so the international community can collectively \nrespond to threats to international peace and security. But simply \nsending peacekeepers is not enough if they are not going to protect the \ninnocent and engage the wicked. We must demand more from the \npeacekeepers or we will face the consequences of failed states.\n  Mr. President, I will come to the floor in the near future and talk \nat greater length about Haiti and the crisis that is occurring in \nHaiti. Today I simply want to spend another moment to talk about the \npeacekeepers.\n  I had the opportunity to be in Haiti--I have visited Haiti many \ntimes--when our U.S. troops were down there shortly after President \nAristide left. In my career in the Senate, I don't know anything that \nhas made me prouder to be an American than to see our United States \ntroops in Haiti, to walk the slums of Port-au-Prince with our troops, \nto see young children come up--run up--these poor children who have \nabsolutely nothing in the world, to run up to our troops and see the \nrelationship between those troops and those children.\n  When our troops went to Haiti, they did it the right way. They \nengaged in civil work. They helped clear the sewers. They helped clear \nthe open sewers we find in City Soleil, the worst slum in Port-au-\nPrince. They would go out and set up clinics to help children and \nadults with their medical needs. They brought medical care to people \nwho had not seen medical care. At the same time, they brought order and \nstability. They made City Soleil an example. In a slum in Port-au-\nPrince of 300,000 to 400,000 people, they brought order and peace, \nsomething the people living there have never seen before. The \nhumanitarian groups working in City Soleil tell me this was the first \ntime they have really seen peace, when our troops were there.\n  I talked with the U.S. commanders. Our troops were about to leave, \nand the U.N. peacekeeping mission was about to come in. Our U.S. \ncommanders told me: Senator DeWine, we are telling the U.N. commanders \nwhen they come in, they better take charge immediately. They better let \nthe gang leaders, the thugs, and the people who will cause the problems \nknow who is in charge, and they better let them know immediately \nbecause if they do not, we are going to tell them there will be chaos, \nthe violence will return, and death will return to Haiti.\n  That is what they told the U.N. peacekeeping mission. Tragically, the \nU.N. peacekeepers apparently did not listen. They did not take charge \nand chaos has returned.\n  Many of us have urged the U.N. and the peacekeepers there and the \ncountries involved to be more aggressive with the thugs to help the \npeople of Haiti, to help restore order. But it is not that simple. The \nU.N. engaged in a mission on July 7, I believe it was, in City Soleil \nwhere they tried to deal with one gang leader, a gang leader who had \nbeen causing a lot of problems. They did, in fact, deal with him. They \nkilled him. But by the reports I have received from my sources in City \nSoleil, they also killed 50, 60, 70 civilians, a horrible botched \noperation, from everything I can tell, at least, and I am still trying \nto find out exactly what happened.\n\n  So it is not just a question of getting tough, it is a question of \ndoing it the right way. It is a question of going out, being among the \npeople, working with the people, having good intelligence, knowing what \nis going on, and then acting against the people who would rain havoc on \nthe community.\n  There are a million things wrong with Haiti--a port that does not \nwork, not enough food, electricity that is not on, a government that is \nstruggling. But nothing will work in Haiti, nothing can be done in \nHaiti unless there is some order, unless there is some security. Haiti \ntoday is on the brink of chaos. The United States and the international \ncommunity are going to have to do something about it.\n  We are coming very close to the point where the United States, \nwhether we like it or not, is going to have to send troops back to \nHaiti. No one wants to hear it now. No one wants to talk about that. \nBut that is the situation that is fast approaching.\n  I will be back on the Senate floor in the next few days to talk more \nabout that, but what we see today is a failed U.N. mission and a very \ndangerous situation in Haiti. People may ask, Why do we worry about \nHaiti? Why do we care about what is going on? We care from a \nhumanitarian point of view--8 million people in Haiti who starve every \nday, people who die from violence every day. We should care about\n\n[[Page S8381]]\n\nthe children who are down there. We should care about the innocent \npeople.\n  If we do not care about that, we should care because Haiti is on our \ndoorstep. Haiti is not going to go away. It is there. We should be \nconcerned about it. We should be concerned because Haiti is becoming a \ntransshipment area for drugs into the United States. And we should be \nconcerned because of the boat people who could begin to float back up \nto Miami where our Coast Guard will again have to turn them around.\n  So Haiti is of significance to the United States. It always will be \nbecause of its geographical location. We will always have to be \nconcerned. We have had U.S. troops down there twice in the last decade. \nIn the last century, we have been involved numerous times. Unless the \nsituation changes quickly in the next several weeks, we are going to \nhave to be involved again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/15/senate-section/article/S8381-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8381-S8383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                    Private First Class Devin Grella\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor this afternoon \nto pay tribute to a brave soldier and fellow Ohioan. PFC Devin Grella \nfrom Medina lost his life on September 6, 2004, when an improvised \nexplosive device struck his vehicle near Qarrayah, Iraq. Devin was 21 \nyears old.\n  When I think about the dedication of our men and women in uniform, I \nam reminded of something President Ronald Reagan once said about the \ndevotion to freedom. This is what he said:\n\n       Freedom is a fragile thing, and it is never more than one \n     generation away from extinction. It is not ours by \n     inheritance. It must be fought for and defended constantly by \n     each generation, for it comes only once to a people.\n\n  Devin embodied the spirit of freedom President Reagan so eloquently \ndescribed. He sacrificed his life so we can continue to be free and so \nthe people of Iraq can have the chance to know the freedoms we hold so \ndear. His dedication to and love for his country knew no bounds.\n  Growing up in Medina, Devin loved music and he loved to play the \nviolin, the piano, and the guitar. As one of four boys, Devin was also \nknown for his outgoing personality. Devin's brother Darrin remembers \nhis brother as always having a good time.\n  Devin attended Medina High School his freshman, sophomore, and senior \nyears, and Archbishop Hoban High School for his junior year. He was a \nvery actively involved student who sang in the choir, ran cross \ncountry, and played on the lacrosse team with his younger brother Drew. \nLacrosse coach Pat O'Brien described Devin as ``a good athlete and a \nstrong kid whom the other players looked up to. You could tell he was \nhaving the time of his life when he was on the field.''\n  Off the field, Devin was known for his playful personality. Brother \nDarrin described the time when Devin introduced himself to Cleveland \nCavaliers star Lebron James as ``Debron James,'' since James was his \nmiddle name. Known to family and friends as ``Deuce''--a reference to \nhis favorite number--Devin was a great guy to have around.\n  After graduation in 2002, Devin worked at Donato's Pizza, a local \nrestaurant. Adam Stout, a manager at the restaurant, described Devin as \na hard worker and a great morale booster who would like to laugh, tell \njokes, and make other people laugh.\n  Indeed, wherever he went, Devin made people smile. He wanted to earn \nmoney for college, and out of a sense of patriotism and with a dream of \nbecoming an officer, Devin joined the Army Reserves in December 2003. \nHe was assigned to the 706th Transportation Company out of Mansfield, \nOH. After completing basic training, Devin was deployed to Iraq in June \n2004.\n  While serving overseas, Devin made a lasting impression on his \nsuperiors. Platoon leader 2LT Timothy Searcy noted that Devin was \n``very motivated and dedicated to his job. He set an example.''\n  Army MAJ Willie Harris described Devin as a dedicated soldier ``who \nwas always willing to take on a challenge . . . and who believed in \nwhat he was doing.''\n  Devin was doing extremely dangerous work. In Iraq, Devin and his unit \nwere tasked with delivering fuels and supplies to U.S. troops, \nincluding during heavy combat with U.S. troops and insurgents at Najaf. \nHe regularly sent e-mails to his family, many of which describe the \nconstant threat of roadside bombings and firefights.\n  Tragically, a roadside bomb took the life of this brave young man. An \nIED exploded near Devin's convoy when his unit was resupplying other \ntroops. On that tragic day, our Nation lost a great soldier. More \nimportantly, Donna and Dennis Grella lost a great son; Dustin, Darrin, \nand Drew lost a great brother; and so many others lost a great friend.\n\n  In an e-mail message posted on an Internet tribute to Devin, friend \nAdam Feeks, from Medina, wrote the following to Devin:\n\n       I remember meeting you for the first time in 3rd grade on \n     the basketball court. We became the best of friends shortly \n     thereafter, and our days of watching the Bulls and Cavs games \n     together are days I will never forget. Our unhealthy, but fun \n     obsessions with Mark Price and Michael Jordan will last a \n     lifetime. The memories we shared will never be forgotten. . . \n     . I remember the last thing I said to you. I told you how \n     proud I was of you, and how much I loved you, and that you \n     could tell me all about it when you get back. That day will \n     not come anytime soon. Just know I think about you all the \n     time. Anytime I pick up a ball or step on the football field, \n     it is for you. In my heart is where I keep you friend.\n\n  Devin's father, a former Marine, said this about Devin: He loved his \nchurch. He loved his family. He loved his country.'' Dennis also said \nthat the key thing that must be learned from his son's death is how \nbrave and valiant [Devin] was to give, so that we--you and I and all of \nus--can have freedom.''\n  Devin's mother remembers her son's enthusiasm and love for life. She \nremarked that her family's faith helps them find peace. she knows that \nDevin's death ``is just a separation.'' She said, ``We will be together \nagain. It helps you go on. You know you will see him again.''\n  At the service held in Devin's honor at the Medina chapel of the \nChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Devin's older brother, \nDarrin, decided to address the crowd because he wanted people to know \nabout his brave and heroic brother. Darrin reflected on a conversation \nwith Devin about his plans to join the Army Reserves and emphasized how \nproud he was of his brother. He told those gathered that it was an \nhonor to have been [Devin's] brother.''\n  It was indeed an honor for all those who knew Devin. He touched \ncountless lives. Though words will never be enough to express our \ngratitude for Devin's sacrifice, a simple phrase on his gravestone is \nable to describe his life and this is what it says: Devin James Grella \n. . . Loves his Mom/Loves our God/Called to serve.\n\n\n                      army specialist jesse buryj\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor a fellow Ohioan, a young man \nfrom Canton, whose courage and selflessness knew no bounds. On May 5, \n2004, Army SPC Jesse Buryj gave his life to protect his fellow \nsoldiers, to protect the American people, and to protect Iraqis whom he \nbarely knew. He was 21 years old.\n  Jesse Buryj enlisted in the Army as a way to help him pursue a dream, \nand that was the dream of someday becoming a police officer. The creed \nof any police officer is to serve and protect. Jesse didn't just pledge \nthat motto, he lived by it.\n  Jesse grew up playing kickball and baseball in the street with the \nother kids of his tight-knit community. Like many active young boys, \nJesse experienced his share of broken bones and knocked out teeth. His \nmother, Peggy, recalls that the nurses in the emergency room at Mercy \nMedical Center knew him well.\n  Jesse stood apart, though, from many of the boys his age. He was a \nparticularly well-mannered, well-rounded young man. Angela, Jesse's \nsister, remembered that her little brother wouldn't wait to be found \nout if he did something wrong. He used to go ahead and tell on himself.\n  Jesse attended Canton McKinley High School and was a Bulldog to his \ncore. He played the baritone in the school band, where, on several \nmemorable occasions, he left his indelible mark. Jesse was the first \nbaritone to dot the ``I'' in the school's Script Ohio formation and was \na sight to see at the Massillon-McKinley football game when he draped \nhimself in Christmas lights.\n\n[[Page S8382]]\n\n  Though dedicated to the band, Jesse didn't spend all his time during \npractices concentrating on the music. A certain piccolo player, named \nAmber Tichenor caught his eye. It didn't take long before the two \nbecame high school sweethearts. Those around them noticed that they \nseemed meant for each other right from the start of their days together \nin the band, so much so that their band director, Ed Arrington, married \nthem in October 2003.\n  Jesse looked forward to his life together with Amber, still holding \nonto the dream he had cultivated since the third grade of becoming a \npolice officer in the same department where he served as a cadet \nthroughout high school. Jesse knew that he would not be old enough upon \nhigh school graduation to attend the police academy. Not deterred by \nthis, he decided to enlist in the Army to gain experience as a military \npolice officer first. Jesse enlisted in the Army and became an MP.\n  Family and friends recalled how committed Jesse was to training the \nsummer before his enlistment. He wanted to enter the service as ready \nas he could be. In September 2002, he was placed with the Army's 66th \nMilitary Police Company stationed in Fort Lewis, WA. Before his \ndeployment to Iraq, Jesse worked as a guard at the Pentagon and trained \nas a paratrooper. While in Iraq, Jesse guarded military checkpoints.\n  During his all too brief life, Jesse made a huge impact on his \nfriends at home and on his fellow service members. That was very clear \nto me upon reading several of the e-mail messages that people posted on \nan Internet tribute to Jesse following his death in Iraq. I would like \nto read from two of the many e-mails.\n  SGT Michael D'Saachs from the Military Police Company in Fort Lewis \nwrote the following:\n\n       It's been a year since you were taken from our brotherhood. \n     I will never forget you, my friend. I hope that you will \n     watch over all of us and keep us safe. I never got to thank \n     you for all the tips you gave me before I went to school. We \n     all miss you.\n\n  A friend named Matt had this to say:\n\n       Jesse--you were the best friend anyone could ask for. I \n     still cannot believe you are gone. Thank you for listening to \n     me when I had problems. Nobody will ever replace you as my \n     battle buddy or best friend. I love you and cannot wait to \n     see you again.\n\n  During the military ceremony held in his honor, Jesse's commanders \nrepeatedly spoke of his bravery and sense of responsibility. GEN Dennis \nMoran said that ``as a military police officer, his first job was to \nserve and protect. He trusted his life to those soldiers as they \ntrusted theirs to him.''\n  Lieutenant Colonel Tatum also spoke fondly of Jesse saying that he \ngave no ground and showed no fear.\n  Matthew Beadoin, the best man at Jesse's wedding, described his \nclosest friend as the ``bravest person, friend, and soldier [I've] ever \nknown.'' Others recalled his immense compassion and how much fun he was \nto just be around.\n  In memory of this true American hero, the flag was lowered to half-\nstaff at Canton McKinley High School and a memorial to Jesse was placed \nin the band room. During the funeral procession, members of the \ncommunity lined the street to show their support for Jesse's family.\n  I conclude my remarks by reading from an e-mail message that Allen \nVandayburg of Mansfield, OH, left on that Internet tribute for Jesse. I \nhave met Allen Vandayburg. I met him and his wife when I attended the \ncalling hours for their 20-year-old son, Army SPC A.J. Vandayburg, who \nwas killed in Iraq a short time before Jesse.\n  He wrote the following:\n\n       We are so sorry for your loss. . . . We also know [your] \n     pain. We lost our son in Iraq. There are no words and the \n     pain is forever, but just know you are not alone in your \n     grief, as we well found out. Not only did we lose a child, \n     but America lost a hero. I am a police officer, and it sounds \n     like Jesse would have made a fine Officer, as we already know \n     he was a great soldier. Remember--you are not alone.\n\n  My wife, Fran, and I continue to keep Jesse's wife, Amber; his \nparents, Steve and Peggy; and his sister, Angela, in our thoughts and \nin our prayers.\n\n\n                     staff sergeant omer t. hawkins\n\n  Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to pay tribute to a fellow \nOhioan and a true American hero. On October 14, 2004, SSG Omer ``O.T.'' \nHawkins, from Cherry Fork in Adams County, gave his life in service to \nour Nation. He was killed when an improvised explosive device detonated \nnear his vehicle outside Ar Ramadi, Iraq. O.T. was 31 years-old.\n  When we think about the sacrifices of our servicemen and women, we \nshould remember what President Ronald Reagan said in his first \ninaugural address. He said that ``no arsenal or no weapon in the \narsenals of the world is as formidable as the will and moral courage of \nfree men and women.''\n  SSG O.T. Hawkins lived these words. He loved this country more than \nanything else and was proud to serve in protection of it. He knew the \npotential costs and dangers of military service, but he never shied \naway. Family and friends will forever remember O.T.'s dedication to the \ncause of freedom and his commitment to bringing that freedom to people \naround the world.\n  O.T. knew from a young age that he wanted to join the Army. When he \nwas just 10 years old, he composed a three sentence letter to the Army \nwritten in cursive. In it, he wrote: Do you take 10 year-old boys? If \nyou do, I will come and sign up. Please, can I join?'' O.T. asked his \nmother, Lisa, to mail his letter. Instead, she safely tucked it away \ninto her Bible.\n  O.T.'s mother still has that letter today, 22 years later.\n  When O.T. was a kid, even the games he played were geared toward \njoining the military. His friend, Russell Todd, knew O.T. since their \ndays in elementary school together. He remembers that all O.T. ever \ntalked about was joining the Army. The two young boys used to play war \ngames on a hill outside Cherry Fork.\n  At North Adams High School, O.T. was known as a quiet kid, but one \nwho enjoyed the occasional prank and practical joke. Russell Todd also \nremembers the time the two decided to ride the carousel horses at K-\nMart, at 4 in the morning. Though he loved to have fun, O.T. also had a \nserious side, being voted as ``most likely to succeed'' by the rest of \nhis senior class.\n  O.T.'s teachers describe him as that rare student who could combine \nhumor with intellect and determination. History teacher, Tom Breeze, \nremembers O.T. as a scholar and voracious reader, who would skim \nthrough an almanac or encyclopedia ``looking for bits of information \nbecause he just liked to learn.'' O.T. played baseball and was on the \ndebate team. And, though he could have pursued just about any career he \nwanted after high school, the military remained his number one love and \nlifelong goal.\n  Just 2 days after his high school graduation and 8 years after he \nwrote that priceless letter to the Army expressing his desire to join, \nO.T. enlisted in the Army. Not only was he following his dream, O.T. \nwas following in the footsteps of his father, William, who had been an \nengineer with the Marines until he passed away from a brain aneurysm in \n1977.\n  Once in the Army, O.T. was recognized by his superiors as a \npassionate and capable soldier. Having served on tours of duty in \nAfghanistan, Bosnia, Egypt, Kosovo, and Somalia, O.T. was a deeply \nrespected and beloved superior. As a member of the 44th Engineer \nBattalion, 2nd Infantry Division, stationed in Camp Howze in Korea, \nO.T. saw it as his mission to keep his men safe. After all, O.T. \nconsidered his comrades to be family. His fellow soldiers felt the \nsame.\n  Army Specialist Justin Malzac wrote the following in an email message \nposted on an Internet tribute to O.T. after his death:\n\n       I had the honor to serve in the same company and platoon as \n     Staff Sergeant Hawkins. His aura always gave great hope to \n     his soldiers. He was a stunning leader and a great man, I am \n     just thankful to have known him. He has left a permanent \n     impact on me. Rest in peace, ``Mother Hen.''\n\n  O.T. Hawkins' life was tragically cut short less than 2 weeks into \nhis deployment as platoon leader. When he died, Our Nation lost a great \nsoldier. But, more importantly, O.T.'s family lost a great son, \nbrother, and uncle.\n  I had the privilege of meeting O.T.'s family and friends at the \nmemorial service held in his honor. I want to thank them for sharing \ntheir memories with me. After speaking with them, it is clear that this \nextraordinary young man believed in his service and lost his life doing \nwhat he truly loved. I know that O.T. lives in their memories.\n  His mother, Lisa, fondly recalls that when O.T.'s nephew was born, \nO.T.\n\n[[Page S8383]]\n\ntucked a tiny American flag into the baby's curled fist.\n  His brother--Missouri National Guardsman, James ``Buck'' Hawkins--\nwill cherish the letters O.T. sent in support of his duty and service \nto our Nation.\n  His sister, Cherry, will remember the brother she treated more like a \nson.\n  They all find solace in knowing that O.T. now peacefully rests \nalongside another great man and dedicated serviceman--O.T.'s dad, \nWilliam.\n  We will never forget SSG Omer T. Hawkins.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez).

Mr. President, I opposed the Ensign and McCain amendments \nNos. 1219 and 1171 to the Homeland Security Appropriations bill, H.R. \n2360.\n  These amendments would have shifted $566 million from grants for \nfirst responders, including our State and local police officers, \nfirefighters, and emergency health providers, to provide for an \nincrease in detention beds and border security personnel. Those cuts in \nfirst responder funds would have been in addition to the $467 million \nin first responder cuts already included in the underlying bill, \nresulting in a cut of 43 percent below fiscal year 2005. Such a cut in \nfunding for equipping and training our first responders at a time when \nthe Nation is at risk of a terrorist attack would not be appropriate. \nIn addition, the Ensign amendment would have provided new spending \npower to the Homeland Security Secretary, which is not necessary or \nappropriate.\n  Having successfully sponsored an amendment to the fiscal year 2005 \nIraq supplemental that added 500 Border Patrol agents, 218 immigration \ninvestigators, and detention officers, and 1,950 detention beds, and \nhaving worked closely with Chairman Gregg to see that the underlying \nbill includes robust funding for our border security, I know that such \nefforts can be achieved without cutting vital funds for our first \nresponders or providing new spending authority to the Secretary of \nHomeland Security. Indeed, if the amendments were adopted, the funds \nwould likely have sat in the Treasury because the Department could not \nhire and train more personnel than the levels provided in the committee \nbill.\n  That is why I, along with a bipartisan majority of the Senate, joined \nwith the chairman to oppose these amendments.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to add my thoughts to the debate \non the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill for fiscal \nyear 2006.\n  First, I want to preface my remarks by applauding the chairman and \nranking member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee for \ntheir work on this important bill. They worked within very difficult \nconstraints and had to make incredibly difficult tradeoffs in deciding \nwhere to place our homeland security spending priorities. The fight \nagainst terrorism is our number one priority and this appropriations \nbill is a key component in that fight.\n  We have been debating this important bill in the aftermath of the \nrecent terrorist attacks in London. Those horrible attacks served as \nyet another reminder of the importance of working with our allies to \ndefeat terrorist networks. This tragic event also reminds us of how \nmuch we rely on our first responders and the employees of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to keep us safe. I want to thank these \nbrave men and women who work daily to protect this Nation. They are on \nthe front lines of the fight against terrorism. They are the ones who \nare called on to stop and respond to any future attack upon our Nation. \nThis bill includes important resources these brave men and women need \nto perform their critical tasks.\n  I was pleased that the Senate adopted my amendment requiring the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to report to Congress on its use of \ndata-mining in fiscal year 2006. This amendment will provide the \nAmerican people with critical information about the use of and plans \nfor data-mining technology and the way highly personal information, \nlike credit reports, travel records and other personal information, may \nbe obtained and used by our Government. This amendment will not stop \nany data-mining--it simply requires the Department of Homeland Security \nto report to Congress on any data-mining programs it is using or \ndeveloping and how these programs implicate the civil liberties and \nprivacy of all Americans. With complete information, the American \npeople will be able to make considered judgments about which programs \nshould and should not go forward.\n  I was also pleased that the Senate adopted an amendment that I \ncosponsored that was offered by Senator Voinovich. This amendment \nincreases funding for Emergency Management Performance Grants, EMPG, by \n$10 million to $190 million, which is $20 million more than requested \nby the President. The EMPG program is crucial in assisting State and \nlocal officials in preparing for all-hazards emergencies. The program \nprovides emergency managers with the resources they need to increase \ncoordination and planning so that if an emergency occurs, State and \nlocal officials will respond much more efficiently and effectively. \nAlthough this boost in funding does not fully address the $264 million \nshortfall identified last year by the National Emergency Management \nAssociation, it is an important step in the right direction.\n  Unfortunately, not all of our first responder programs fared as well. \nMany, including firefighter grants and State homeland security grants, \nwere significantly cut. This bill also has less funding for transit \nsecurity than last year's Senate bill and bipartisan efforts to \nincrease that funding to levels authorized by the Senate last year \nunfortunately failed. Although I am very disappointed with the major \ncuts to first responder programs and the failure to increase transit \nfunding, I believe this bill accomplishes a lot within the budgetary \nconstraints in which it operates. It goes a long way towards improving \nour border security and to combating the multitude of evolving threats \nfaced by our Nation. However, I regret that it does not go far enough.\n  Let me explain. I strongly agree with the distinguished chairman when \nhe said that Congress must decide on the budget priorities within the \ncontext of a reasonable budget for national defense and homeland \nsecurity. We must answer the question: Do our national security budget \npriorities most effectively address the threats we face? I believe that \nthis homeland security bill does a reasonably good job within its \nlimited budget allocation. However, within the broader context of our \noverall national security spending, our priorities are abysmally out of \ntouch with reality. For example, we continue to spend $8 billion to $10 \nbillion a year on an unproven missile defense system. Those figures \nsuggest that this troubled program is almost twice as important to our \nNation's security as Customs and Border Protection, three times more \nimportant than the entire Transportation Security Administration, and \nthree times more important than the combined funding for our first \nresponders, ports, transit, and rail security. It is time to take a \nbroader view when it comes to our national security budget priorities \nand make the tradeoffs that must be made.\n  I supported several amendments that would have added funding for \ncritical security needs not fully addressed in this bill. I must point \nout again this year that I do not take lightly my decision to vote in \nfavor of spending more money. Fiscal responsibility is one of my \nhighest priorities and I constantly look for ways to limit government \nspending. I am honored that the Concord Coalition and others have \nrecognized me for my efforts in this regard. Although fiscal \nresponsibility remains one of my top priorities, it is imperative that \nwe provide the resources needed to combat terrorism.\n  I voted for this bill because it provides funding for many important \nsecurity needs. However, our Nation's vulnerabilities demand more and I \nwill continue to work to ensure that our vital homeland security needs \nare met.\n\n[[Page S8384]]\n\n             Stopping Gun Violence Through Public Awareness\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to make my colleagues aware of \none of the many organizations working to bring an end to the gun \nviolence problem in this country, the PAX organization based in New \nYork City. According to their Web site, PAX is ``the largest non-\npolitical, nonprofit organization dedicated to ending the gun violence \nepidemic in America.'' As part of its public health campaigns, PAX \npromotes commonsense solutions to help protect families, teenagers, and \nchildren from the tragedy of gun violence.\n  One national program run by PAX, known as the Asking Saves Kids or \nASK Campaign, encourages parents to simply ask other parents if there \nare guns in the homes where their children play. According to \nstatistics cited by the ASK Campaign, more than 40 percent of \nhouseholds with children have guns. In the overwhelming majority of \nthese households, the child also knows where the gun is hidden. Using \npublic service advertising and grassroots education, the ASK Campaign \nis working to prevent accidental shootings involving children by \nencouraging parents to take common sense steps to protect their \nchildren. The ASK Campaign is a partnership between PAX and the Academy \nof Pediatrics and is supported by more than 400 organizations \nnationwide including the American Medical Association, the American \nFederation of Teachers, the National Education Association, the \nChildren's Defense Fund, and the Police Executive Research Forum.\n  According to PAX, in 75 percent of the school shootings in our \ncountry, the attackers told other students of their plans prior to the \nattack. In addition, PAX states that students bring more than 100,000 \nguns to school every day. To help address these issues, PAX has created \nthe Speak Up Campaign. The centerpiece of the campaign is a national \nhotline, 1-866-SPEAK-UP, where children and teenagers can call to \nanonymously report threats involving weapons at their school. Since the \ncreation of the hotline in 2002, the Speak Up Campaign has received \nmore than 5,000 calls which were then passed along to appropriate law \nenforcement officials. To increase public awareness of school violence \nprevention and the Speak Up hotline, the campaign has created an \noutreach program for schools and other community organizations. PAX has \nalso partnered with various cable networks including MTV, NBC, ABC, and \nCBS to help reach children, teens, and parents with its message.\n  I thank the PAX organization and their partners for their work to end \ngun violence. Their commonsense approach provides families with \npractical solutions to help protect themselves from the tragedy of gun \nviolence. I am hopeful that the 109th Congress will do more to support \ntheir efforts by taking up and passing sensible gun safety legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/15/senate-section/article/S8384-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. \n             Bond, Mr. Burns, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Carper, \n             Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Rockefeller):\n       S. 1411.

A bill to direct the Administrator of the Small Business \nAdministration to establish a pilot program to provide regulatory \ncompliance assistance to small business concerns, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished \ncolleague from Maine and Chair of the Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship Committee, Senator Olympia J. Snowe, in reintroducing \nthe National Small Business Regulatory Assistance Act. This bill has a \nlong history of bipartisan support in Congress because of the critical \nassistance it provides to small businesses.\n  Small businesses, particularly small businesses with very few \nemployees, often are overwhelmed with the task of complying with \nFederal regulations, especially when implementation varies for \ndifferent regions of the country, or from State to State. Many small \nbusinesses fail to comply with important and needed labor and \nenvironmental regulations not because they want to break the law, but \nbecause they are unaware of the actions they need to take to comply. In \naddition, small business owners are often afraid to seek guidance from \nFederal agencies for fear of exposing problems at their businesses.\n  One important way to help small businesses comply with Federal \nregulations is to provide them with free, confidential advice outside \nof the normal relationship between a small business and a regulatory \nagency. The Small Business Administration's Small Business Development \nCenters, SBDCs, are in a unique position to provide this type of \nassistance, with some 1,000 centers around the country, well-\nestablished relationships and visibility within local communities, and \nthe trust of area small businesses.\n  Our bill establishes a 4-year pilot program to award competitive \nmatching grants to 20 selected SBDCs, two from each SBA region, which \nwould allow these SBDCs to provide regulatory compliance assistance to \nsmall businesses. The SBA would be authorized to award grants between \n$150,000 and $300,000, depending on the population of the SBDC's state.\n  Under our legislation, the SBDCs would need to form partnerships with \nFederal compliance programs, conduct educational and training \nactivities, offer free-of-charge compliance counseling to small \nbusiness owners, and consult with the SBA's independent Office of \nAdvocacy. The legislation will complement, not duplicate, current small \nbusiness development assistance and expand upon existing regulatory \ncompliance help.\n  The legislation we are reintroducing today uses only SBA funds and \nwill serve to complement current small-business development assistance \nas well as existing compliance assistance programs. Versions of this \nlegislation introduced in previous Congresses had used Environmental \nProtection Agency, EPA, enforcement funds to pay for these grants.\n  The SBA's independent Office of Advocacy estimates that small \nbusinesses with fewer than 20 employees--which make up 89 percent of \nall U.S. businesses--pay nearly $7,000 per employee to comply with \nFederal regulations. This is nearly 60 percent higher than the cost to \nlarger firms. While all small businesses should be complying with \nFederal regulations, the Federal Government should also do it's best to \nensure that the burden on small businesses is minimized, that small \nbusinesses are taken into account when new regulations are drafted, and \nthat unnecessarily burdensome regulations are eliminated. In addition, \nthe government should make sure that small businesses understand the \nregulations. Often, noncompliance is due to confusion not ill intent. \nBy providing free, private regulatory assistance, we can increase \ncompliance while decreasing the burden on small businesses.\n  Small-business owners have enough on their plates without worrying \nabout complying with confusing regulations. This legislation will \ndecrease the burden on small businesses by helping them cut through \ngovernment red tape. Small businesses can succeed when it comes to \ncomplying with Federal regulations, if provided with the necessary \ntools and information. The National Small Business Regulatory \nAssistance Act will go a long way toward assisting our Nation's small \nbusinesses that want to comply with Federal regulations.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is nearly identical to the \nKerry-Ensign legislation introduced last Congress. On the House side, \nthe National Small Business Regulatory Assistance Act, H.R. 230, has \nbeen introduced and passed by Congressman John Sweeney of New York in \neach of the past three Congresses and was just approved by the Small \nBusiness Committee yesterday. In 2002, our Senate version passed the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship but was not taken up \nby the full Senate.\n  I am pleased to say that we have the full support of the Association \nof Small Business Development Centers, which has been working closely \nwith us to re-introduce the Senate version of this legislation, as well \nas support from the National Small Business Association, the American \nIndustrial Hygiene Association, and Congressman Sweeney.\n  I want to express my sincere thanks to Chair Snowe for her had work \nand support on this issue. I also want to thank our cosponsors, \nSenators Cantwell, Bond, Burns, Leahy, Jeffords, Carper, Bingaman, and \nRockefeller for their ongoing efforts to pass this important \nassistance. I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1411\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prohibit the merger, acquisition, or takeover of \nUnocal Corporation by CNOOC Ltd. of China; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a piece of \nlegislation that deals with the issue of a Chinese oil company called \nCNOOC, a state-owned corporation that has proposed to acquire a United \nStates oil company called Unocal.\n  The purpose of my legislation--and I may well also offer it as an \namendment to the Foreign Operations appropriations bill we will \nconsider today and next week--is to prohibit the sale of Unocal \nCorporation to CNOOC. The legislation provides that notwithstanding any \nother provision in the law, the merger, acquisition, or takeover of \nUnocal Corporation by CNOOC is prohibited. Let me explain why I am \nintroducing.\n  I bear no ill will toward the Chinese. China is an extraordinarily \nlarge country. The Chinese have an extraordinary rate of economic \ngrowth. They are very involved in the world economy. We have a large \ntrade deficit, regrettably, with the Chinese. That has to do with a \nrange of unfair trade practices and other things. We had a $162 billion \ntrade deficit with the Chinese in the past year. This year it is on \ntrack to top $200 billion.\n  I understand what the Chinese are trying to do. They are trying to \nmeet their future energy needs. They have four large state-owned energy \ncompanies. Their companies, including CNOOC, are attempting to acquire \nin many different ways opportunities to satisfy their energy needs. In \nattempting to acquire Unocal, they are attempting to acquire a U.S. \ncorporation with substantial strategically important oil assets for our \ncountry.\n  The reason I believe we ought to prohibit the sale of an American oil \ncompany to a Chinese state-owned oil company is this: There is not and \nwould not be reciprocal treatment. If a United States oil company or a \nUnited States company wanted to buy a Chinese oil company, it wouldn't \nhappen. The Chinese Government wouldn't approve it. The four large \noil companies in China are all state controlled, and as\n\n[[Page S8387]]\n\na practical matter, the Chinese government is not about to approve that \nany of those companies be purchased by a foreign government or foreign \ncompany. There is no reciprocal opportunity for a United States \ncorporation to acquire an oil company in China.\n\n  The Chinese Government is a Communist government. Its economy is \nemerging as market-driven economy under the umbrella of the Chinese \nGovernment. That causes a lot of tensions and interesting \ncircumstances. The Chinese have joined the WTO. They have made all \nkinds of representations about opening their marketplace. But the fact \nis, once again, the largest oil companies, like most other major \nenterprises in China, are state controlled. It makes no sense that we \nwould allow a Chinese state-controlled oil company to acquire, in this \ncase Unocal, a United States oil company at a time when we would not be \nable to reciprocate and we would be prevented from acquiring a Chinese \noil company if we wished to do so.\n  I don't know what the administration's position would be on this. \nThey have a review process. To the extent that the review process takes \nplace, I believe that review process ought to be expanded. But I hope \nwe can avoid all of that by simply deciding as a Congress this is not \nsomething that meets our national interest. Our strategic, security, \nand economic national interest is not served by allowing this to \nhappen.\n  I am introducing this legislation today, and I know that there are \nmany Members of Congress who share my view that this is not a \ntransaction that meets the strategic, security, and economic interests \nof this country. We must trade with China. China is an emerging nation \nwith a very substantial imprint on the world economy. The free flow of \ncommerce and market capital is important. I understand that. This \nlegislation that I am offering is not in any way an attempt to send a \nmessage that we do not want good trade relations with China. But it is \nvery much intended to send this message: reciprocal opportunities ought \nto exist in these transactions, and they would not and do not in this \ncase involving CNOOC and Unocal.\n  It is also important to point out that the money with which CNOOC, a \nChinese state-controlled oil company, would purchase a United States \noil corporation would be in many ways attributable to deep subsidies by \nthe Government of China for a state-owned enterprise in China that \nwishes to acquire a United States oil company.\n  For that reason I will introduce this bill today. I may well also \noffer it as an amendment to the appropriations bill on Monday.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 1414. A bill to provide for the conduct of a study of the \nsuitability and feasibility of establishing the Trail of the Ancients \nNational Heritage Area in the Four Corners region of the States of \nUtah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce S. 1414, a bill \nthat authorizes a study necessary for establishing the Trail of the \nAncients National Heritage Area in the Four Corners region of the \nStates of Utah, New Mexico, Colorado, and Arizona. I am joined by \nSenators Bennett, Bingaman, Domenici, and Allard as cosponsors of this \nbill.\n  The Four Corners region in the Southwestern United States contains \nmany of the most stunning and well-preserved archaeological sites in \nour country. It also offers monuments, museums, and other attractions \nwhich draw visitors from all over the world. The rare archaeology of \nthis part of the world combined with an awesome natural setting makes \nthis a region like no other. With this bill we hope to lay the \ngroundwork to give this region the attention that it so richly \ndeserves.\n  Six years ago, Congress voted to support a partnership among these \nfour States and the Federal Government in order to construct an \nInterpretive Center at the intersection of the Four Corners. This \nCenter has recently opened and now provides a wonderful physical locus \nfor travel in the region. Visitors to this spot can stop, rest, learn \nabout the area, and purchase goods produced by the local Tribes.\n  The designation of the surrounding region as a National Heritage Area \nwould complement this experience at the Center and is the logical next \nstep. Designation as a National Heritage Area would provide geographic \nand interpretive coherence to the region's remarkable landscape and the \namazing cultural sites dispersed within it. Designation as a National \nHeritage Area would give visitors to this area an experience that \nintegrates land, people, and history in a meaningful way.\n  The Four Corners region is also home to the Navaho, Hopi, and Ute \nIndian Tribes, whose ancestors contributed to this remarkable heritage. \nAncestral Puebloan Indians lived here from about A.D. 1 to 1300 and \nleft many of the distinctive sites and structures that are visible \ntoday. The Navaho and Ute are descendants of these early peoples. The \nhistory of this area stretches even further back in time, to the Paleo-\nIndian era of at least 10,000 years ago. Remains from this era provide \na glimpse into a way of life very different from today. The area also \nfeatures sites that chronicle the more recent history of the region's \nnative peoples, and of the immigrants who came to this area as our \ncountry expanded to the West.\n  This bill provides for the Secretary of the Interior to conduct the \nsuitability and feasibility study in cooperation with the Four Corners \nHeritage Council. This Council is a critical partner in the study, and \nis prepared to take the lead in this task. The Council consists of \nmembers from all four States in the Four Corners area. These members \nare appointed by the governor of each State and include representatives \nfrom the private sector, local communities, and the Tribes. We are \nfortunate to have such a well-established entity with a good track \nrecord of accomplishments to take on the study task.\n  The bill follows the new guidelines for National Heritage Areas \nrecently passed by this body and was crafted in consultation with the \nNational Park Service and the Four Corners Heritage Council. Once \npassed, this bill should move easily through the process to completion. \nFinal designation of this area as the Trail of the Ancients National \nHeritage Area would link many of the cultural and recreational sites in \nthe region for the benefit of local communities and visitors to the \narea. Designation of the area would not impose restrictions on private \nproperty or require acquisition of additional land.\n  S. 1414 is the first step in the national heritage area designation \nprocess. Designation of this area as the Trail of the Ancients National \nHeritage Area would give these remarkable historic treasures the \nnational prominence they deserve, and would provide a structure for the \nState and local communities to promote heritage tourism and economic \ndevelopment. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/15/senate-section/article/S8387-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1226.
