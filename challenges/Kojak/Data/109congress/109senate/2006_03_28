Mr. President, the King James version of the Bible \ntells us that shortly after the creation of man:\n\n       The Lord God said ``It is not good that the man should be \n     alone; I will make a helpmate for him.''\n       And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam.\n\n  It continues that ``he took one of his ribs . . . and . . . made he a \nwoman.''\n\n       And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of \n     my flesh.\n\n  The verse concludes:\n\n       Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and \n     shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.\n\n  Mr. President, for almost 69 years, Robert Byrd and Erma Ora James \nByrd have been one--since their marriage on May 29, 1937. And today I \nrise to offer my heartfelt condolences to the Senator from West \nVirginia, Robert Byrd, on the passing of his dear wife.\n  Senator Byrd has served for nearly 50 years in the Senate as our \ncornerstone--a reminder of this body's mission and duty. Sadly, the \ncornerstone of the Senate has lost the keystone of his life. Erma Ora \nJames Byrd went home to be with her Creator on this Saturday past, at \nthe age of 88.\n  Erma Byrd was born in Floyd County, VA, and moved to the coalfields \nof West Virginia as a child with her family. Her father was a coal \nminer and came to the State to work.\n  As a Kentuckian--another State of coal miners--I was always moved to \nhear Senator Byrd proudly declare that he had, in fact, married a coal \nminer's daughter.\n\n[[Page S2430]]\n\n  On the Byrds' 65th wedding anniversary in 2002, Senator Byrd said:\n\n       Erma and I are complete and whole, a total that is more \n     than the sum of its parts. In my life, Erma Ora Byrd is the \n     diamond.\n\n  As every schoolchild in West Virginia learns, coal, when placed under \ngreat pressure, becomes a diamond. So it is fitting that Senator Byrd \nhas the coalfields to thank for bringing his beloved Erma to him.\n  The Byrds' marriage was a study of partnership, devotion, and \nteamwork. It was living proof of the deep bonds that grow between a \nloving husband and wife. My own parents were married for 50 years, so I \nhave seen firsthand the strength of those bonds and know the heartache \nwhen they are broken--until the reunion.\n  And so we grieve with our friend for his loss. Our prayers are with \nhim. But we also know West Virginia's great Senator will one day be \nrejoined with his beloved Mrs. Byrd.\n  May God bless our friend Robert Byrd and the Byrd family.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  I withhold that suggestion.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/28/senate-section/article/S2430-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2430-S2431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO MAGGIE INOUYE AND ERMA ORA BYRD\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I join with my colleague from Kentucky in \nexpressing my deep sense of sorrow, as well, over the passing of two \nmembers of our family. And I speak of both the wife of our colleague \nfrom Hawaii, Senator Inouye, who lost his beloved Maggie a week or so \nago and, of course, the recent news we received over the weekend of the \npassing of Erma Ora Byrd. These are members of our family, in a sense.\n  I have known both Mrs. Byrd and Mrs. Inouye since I was a child. My \nfather was a Member of this body and was elected, in fact, to the \nSenate on the same day Robert Byrd was, in 1958. So I have had the \nprivilege of serving with Senator Byrd both indirectly and directly for \nthese now more than 40 years. In fact, I have the unique privilege of \nbeing his seatmate in this body, something which I have enjoyed \nimmensely over the past decade and a half that I have sat at this seat \nin the Senate next to the distinguished senior Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  I certainly remember Maggie Inouye. She was wonderful to my parents \nand was good to me over the years. To watch two of our colleagues about \nwhom we care so deeply go through the tremendous suffering they are \ngoing through as a result of the loss of their life mates is something \nall of us--regardless of where we sit in this Chamber, to what party we \nbelong, in what direction our ideological compass may lead us--we all \nhave a deep sense of loss for these wonderful people.\n  Dan and Maggie Inouye were very close to my parents, as I mentioned. \nShe was born in 1924 and attended schools in Hawaii and then went on to \nreceive degrees at the University of Hawaii and Columbia University and \nwas highly respected in the area of speech pathology. She was a \nremarkable woman in her own right who could have had a very \ndistinguished career independently of her husband.\n  She and Dan met in 1947, and as Dan Inouye likes to tell the story, \non the second date he proposed marriage. Not one to delay at all, he \nhad met the person he clearly decided was going to be his life mate. \nAnd for the next 57 years, they were just that.\n  They celebrated the birth of their son Kenny who was again a \nwonderful child and has done a remarkable job in his own right.\n  I will remember Maggie best for her grace and poise and I was \nsaddened to hear of her passing after a long battle with cancer earlier \nthis month.\n  I went out to Hawaii last week and attended Maggie's funeral along \nwith Senator Stevens and his wife Catherine. It was a long trip, and I \nknow that Dan did not expect a large number of his colleagues to make \nthat journey. It was not a hard trip to make. It would have been harder \nnot to make it in my case, given the closeness of our families over the \nyears. And for me I knew there was nowhere else I could be than being \npresent with Dan and his family to celebrate the life of Maggie.\n  During the visitation period prior to the funeral service, I was \ndeeply moved by watching literally a couple thousand people express \ntheir condolences to Dan, to his son Kenny, Kenny's wife, Jessica. Each \nexpression was heartfelt. It was personal. These were relationships \nthat were solidified over years of friendship with Dan Inouye, with his \nwife Maggie, and the constituents and friends of theirs from Hawaii.\n\n  I was also moved by the peacefulness of the funeral service, and most \nespecially by the very touching and eloquent eulogy delivered by \nMaggie's longtime friend, Sumi McCabe.\n  I would like to close by offering my thoughts and prayers, once \nagain, to Dan, to his son Kenny, and to his daughter-in-law Jessica.\n  As we mourn the loss of this wonderful woman, let us remember that \nher spirit will be with us and that her inspirational legacy will live \non in the generations to come of her family.\n  So again, to our friend Dan, we want to express our deep sense of \nloss and our sense of solidarity with him.\n  Mr. President, to lose, just a few days later, of course, the wife of \nour great friend and leader, Senator Byrd, was a major blow as well. \nCertainly, the history of Erma Ora Byrd is well known to all of us.\n  As Senator McConnell just pointed out, she was the daughter of a coal \nminer. She had been the life mate, for 69 years, of our colleague from \nWest Virginia. It was clear to anyone who had the fortune of knowing \nthem that they loved each other very deeply.\n  Erma Ora James was born in Floyd County, VA, in 1917. The daughter of \na coal miner, as I just mentioned, her family moved to Raleigh County, \nWV, where she met Robert while attending the Mark Twain Grade School.\n  They were married when they were both 19 years of age in 1937. \nShortly thereafter they began a loving family that has grown to two \ndaughters, five grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.\n  Even though she was content to remain out of Washington's limelight, \nErma became quickly known and loved for her commonsense values and her \ndevotion to her family.\n  Erma also became well respected for her advocacy on issues affecting \nchildren across West Virginia and, of course, our Nation as well. Two \nacademic scholarship programs at Marshall University and West Virginia \nUniversity, respectively, have been named in her honor as a result of \nher efforts.\n  Four years ago, at the couple's 65th wedding anniversary, Senator \nByrd said of his wife:\n\n       Erma and I are complete and whole, a total that is more \n     than the sum of its parts. In my life, Erma Ora Byrd is the \n     diamond. She is a priceless treasure, a multifaceted woman of \n     great insight and wisdom, of quiet humor and common sense. I \n     wish that more people could know the joy I have had in \n     finding one's soul mate early in life and then sharing that \n     deep companionship over many happy years.\n\n  Mr. President, my thoughts and prayers, along with those of our \ncolleagues, I know, are with Senator Byrd and his family in these \nhours. I wish to extend my sympathies to Robert; his daughters, Mona \nand Marjorie; their husbands, Mohammed and Jon; Robert and Erma's \ngrandchildren, Erik, Darius, Fredrik, Mona, and Mary; and Robert and \nErma's great-grandchildren, Caroline, Kathryn, Anna, Emma, Hannah, and \nMichael.\n  Knowing of Senator Byrd's love for poetry, I am reminded of a passage \nin Thomas Gray's ``Elegy in a Country Churchyard,'' which happened to \nbe my father's favorite poem. Gray's ``Elegy'' says in one of its \nstanzas:\n\n     Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,\n     Heaven did a recompense as largely send:\n     He gave to Misery all he had, a tear,\n     He gained from Heaven ('twas all he wished) a friend.\n\n  Robert gained a wonderful friend, obviously, and a companion--a life \ncompanion--in Erma. It is my hope that her spirit remains with us and \nwill inspire all of us and future generations to come.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I wish to take a minute to offer my \nsincerest condolences to Senator Byrd on the passing of his beloved \nwife Erma. In a love story that is both moving and inspiring to all \npeople, Robert Byrd's grade school sweetheart became his lifelong best \nfriend in a marriage that spanned almost seven decades. While this \nmakes the loss that much more profound, I would imagine it makes the\n\n[[Page S2431]]\n\nmemories that much sweeter and the love all the more enduring.\n  As somebody who is fortunate enough myself to be married to a \nwonderful woman for the past 14 years, I can only imagine the difficult \ntransition this causes for our dear colleague from the State of West \nVirginia, but I pray that the Byrd family will find strength in this \ndifficult time. I pray that Erma may now rest in eternal peace.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I join many of my colleagues who have been \nspeaking today and yesterday extending their heartfelt sympathy to \nSenator Robert Byrd of West Virginia for the loss of the diamond of his \nlife, Erma. She truly was the light of his life. On many occasions, I \nhave eased over into the chair next to Senator Byrd, and we have talked \nabout how blessed we are with our two wives. He knows my wife Tricia \nand often asks about her, typically the courtesy that Senator Byrd \nextends to all of us.\n  I have asked him about Erma and how she was doing. We talked a lot \nabout what a difference they have made in our lives. There is no \nquestion that he is going to miss her greatly, as will all of the \nfamily, I know. To all of them, we extend our heartfelt sympathies. We \nknow the children and grandchildren are with Senator Byrd now and with \nMrs. Byrd.\n  I remember an occasion on a Friday afternoon standing here when \nSenator Byrd asked me to yield. You are not always sure what Senator \nByrd is asking you to yield for because it could be that you violated \nsome rule of the Senate. But he asked if I would yield so that he could \nspeak on the beauty of the grandson. I had just had my first \ngrandchild, and it happened to be a grandson. He spoke so beautifully, \nso eloquently, totally from memory, and ended with a beautiful quote of \nwhat a grandson means to a grandfather. I was moved by it, literally to \ntears. And of course, when it came out in the Congressional Record, I \nhad it framed. It hangs on the wall of my son's home in Paris, KY. \nObviously, he doesn't think much of it right now, doesn't fully \nappreciate it. But some day, he will read that, and I know he will \nthink of his grandfather and where he has served.\n  I tell that story to remind my colleagues about the kind of man \nSenator Byrd is. He can be a tough adversary. He can cause leaders to \nhave a lot of heartburn. I have had it a couple of times when I was \nstanding here in this place. But it is because he reveres the \ninstitution, because he does care about us as individual men and women. \nHe knows about every one of us. He knows about our families. And not \nonly does he love the institution, but he loves knowledge and great \nhistory and poetry.\n  Many have quoted from his favorite poem in the last couple of days. I \ndon't have a poem. I don't have some great saying from memory. I only \nrise to join all the others in saying how much I admire and appreciate \nthis Senator who is an institution in his own right in this body. I \nknow how much he is suffering right now.\n  Sometimes we get so busy these days in this institution, trying to \nmake it move forward or trying to keep up with the mail and the \nconstituents and the flying back and forth, we really need a few who \nhave very firm rudders and their sails set in the right direction for \nthe best interests of the country. I know that is true of Senator Byrd.\n  Again, I extend my best wishes to him. When he returns, I will join \nall my colleagues in paying my respects to him and my appreciation for \nthe example he set for himself and Erma, his wife of 69 years.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Erma Ora Byrd, \nthe wife of our esteemed colleague, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia. It \nhas always warmed my heart to watch the Senator from West Virginia \nspeak of his wife in conversation, of which we have had many, or as he \nhas stood on this Senate floor. He has mentioned her name, and whenever \nhe mentioned it, he immediately got this glow on his face in reverence \nto his friend, his wife, his love of nearly seven decades.\n  Love of this magnitude should be celebrated. And their marriage of 69 \nyears should be celebrated. As a matter of fact, recently I talked to \nSenator Byrd about his marriage, and he said: I just hope that we can \ncelebrate 70 years of marriage. Well, they did not get to 70 years. \nThey got to 69, plus. And although her body failed her this past \nweekend, and their time together on this Earth ended, the love they \nshared--Senator Byrd and Erma--that love is timeless and that love is \nforever.\n  Robert Byrd is known throughout the country for his intellect and his \npatriotism, for his devotion to this country, to the State of West \nVirginia, his reverence for the Constitution, and his reverence for the \nSenate. But as famous as he is, and as eloquent as he is, and as far as \nhe has gone in this Senate--he has been the leader here; he has been \nthe chairman of committees here--he never would fail to share the \ncredit for his many accomplishments with his wife, who inspired him and \nhumbled him.\n  Erma never sought the spotlight, nor, according to Robert, would she \nallow her husband to bask in it for any longer than absolutely \nnecessary. She strived to be a model of duty and service--service to \none's family and service to one's country.\n  Erma Byrd has always been by her husband's side, ever since they were \nmarried, both of them at the age of 19. Imagine: the age of 19. Their \nlove never waned. It is as strong now as it was on the very day they \nsaid their wedding vows. And I would posit that it has actually grown \ndeeper, far deeper. That love is a bond that will never be broken, and \neven in her death her spirit will remain by his side to guide him on.\n  Erma had been struggling with illness for the past several years. God \nended her battle, allowing her to be at rest. Although Erma's struggle \nwith illness is over, and the deep pain that Robert felt as he watched \nher struggle with this illness is over, we should all know that he \nneeds us now, his friends and his colleagues. He needs us to be his \nfriend as he grieves for the loss of his soulmate.\n  Although we mourn her loss, we must not forget to also celebrate the \nrich, full life she made with her husband, her children, and her \ngrandchildren.\n  The good Senator from West Virginia has always had a penchant for \npoetry, especially when it was used to help him describe Erma. So in \nclosing, I will quote a poem by Charles Jeffreys that the Senator \nhimself has used to describe his marriage to Erma:\n\n     We have lived and loved together\n     Through many changing years;\n     We have shared each other's gladness\n     And wept each other's tears;\n     I have known ne'er a sorrow\n     That was long unsoothed by thee;\n     For thy smiles can make a summer\n     Where darkness else would be.\n\n     Like the leaves that fall around us\n     In autumn's fading hours,\n     Are the traitor's smiles, that darken,\n     When the cloud of sorrow lowers;\n     And though many such we've known, love,\n     Too prone, alas, to range,\n     We both can speak of one love\n     Which time can never change.\n\n     We have lived and loved together\n     Through many changing years,\n     We have shared each other's gladness\n     And wept each other's tears.\n     And let us hope the future,\n     As the past has been will be:\n     I will share with thee my sorrows,\n     And thou thy joys with me.\n\n  When Robert Byrd spoke these words, he meant them deeply in his soul \ntoward his one love. And so my husband joins me, and our family joins \nme, and I know all of our colleagues feel this way: We offer our \nthoughts and prayers to our dear friend Senator Byrd, to his family, \nand to the good people of West Virginia during this difficult time. I \nknow my friend Robert will dedicate his future in the Senate not only \nto the people of West Virginia, whom he serves so proudly, but to his \nincomparable soulmate who so inspired him.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, yesterday in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, there was a historic vote, a\n\n[[Page S2432]]\n\nvote that relates to an issue America has grappled with almost from the \nbeginning. That is the issue of immigration. It is interesting as we \nreflect on our history that we are a nation of immigrants. But for the \nNative Americans who were here on our shores when the first White men \narrived, we have all come to this country either directly or indirectly \nthrough our parents, grandparents, or previous generations. It is that \nimmigration which has made America such a unique and diverse place. We \ntake great pride in our roots, where we came from, and even greater \npride in where we have planted those roots in American soil. That is a \nfact of life in America. It brings a special quality to this country.\n  Think of the people who have decided to come to our shores, men and \nwomen who walked away from a comfortable life in a familiar place with \na familiar church, with family, a culture, a language, to embark on a \njourney to a place they had never seen before, to come to a country \nwhere they could not speak the language, to live in a place where they \nwere not certain what their future would hold. It takes an \nextraordinary person to make that leap of faith into the future. It \ntakes an extraordinary family to decide that their future is going to \nbe here in a new place.\n  The story I have described has been repeated millions of times. The \npeople who had the courage to step forward and come here have brought a \nspecial quality to this country, a quality we admire--creativity, a \nlove of freedom, entrepreneurship, things that make America a much \ndifferent place in the world, an America which we are all proud to call \nhome.\n\n  An interesting thing happened in the course of history. Those who \ncame first would look at the ships coming in and say: No, not more of \nthose people. That is part of it, too--an intolerance for immigration \neven as we know our own birthright included an immigrant experience.\n  Now we are involved in a national debate about some 11 or 12 million \nin our midst who are not here with proper documentation, not having \nfollowed the proper legal process. We have been asked to reflect on \nthat. Do we need them? Are they an important part of America?\n  They are a very important part, not just for the spirit they bring \nbut for what they do each day. These are the men and women who probably \ncooked your breakfast, probably cleared the table after you finished, \nwashed the dishes in the kitchen. These are the people who each day \nclean your hotel room. They are the ones who are watching your children \nat daycare. They are taking care of your aging parent at a nursing home \nat this moment. They make sure that when you go to the golf course the \nputting green is perfect. They stand in line many times for 8 hours or \nmore in dull, tough jobs, in damp cold, experience watching chicken \ncarcasses and beef carcasses go by so you can enjoy a barbecue over the \nweekend. They take jobs many people won't take. That is the immigrant \nstory.\n  They volunteer to serve our country. Some 60,000 of them are now in \nthe U.S. military, not legal citizens--here legally but not citizens--\nwilling to put on that uniform, take an oath of loyalty to the United \nStates, and literally risk their lives for you and for me. Some of them \ndie in the process. We have this kind of cruel wrinkle in the law that \nif you die in service to America, we will make you a citizen after you \ndie. Their grieving parents receive folded American flags in gratitude \nfrom a nation that is so thankful for their heroism.\n  Now they have come forward out of the shadows, hundreds of thousands \nof them across America, protesting a bill that passed the House of \nRepresentatives which would make a criminal out of every single one of \nthem, not just ordinary criminals but aggravated felons. The House \nbill, the Sensenbrenner bill which passed, says that the 11 or 12 \nmillion in America who are undocumented would be branded as aggravated \nfelons, the same type of criminal penalty which we save for the worst--\narmed robbers and rapists. That is what the House bill would do. That \nis what they would brand these people, the same people who sit next to \nus in church, whose kids go to school with our kids, the same people we \nsee every day though we may not speak to them. That bill is cruel. That \nbill is wrong.\n  Yesterday, the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate on a \nbipartisan basis decided that there was a better way. By a 12-to-6 \nvote, the Senate Judiciary Committee said the following: First, if we \nare going to be a secure America, we need to know who lives here. We \nneed to know the names and addresses and workplaces of all the people \nin America, particularly the 11 or 12 million undocumented. So for \nsecurity purposes, we moved forward with this bill to identify who \nthese people are, where they live, where they are from, and to make \ncertain that any single one of them who is a threat to America would be \nremoved and has to leave. But we went further. We said: We need to \ntoughen the borders, too. Let's make sure we enforce the laws that are \nthere. America can't absorb every single person who wants to come here. \nThat is physically impossible. So we need better enforcement at the \nborders, and we need enforcement when it comes to employment. If we say \nto employers: We need to know who is working for you, we need to know \nif, in fact, they are American citizens, and we will enforce the law, \nit is going to tighten the system.\n  The second thing we did was essential. We said to the people who are \nhere: We are going to give you a chance, a chance to become legal in \nthe eyes of America. But it won't be easy. It will take you a long \ntime. It will take you more than 10 years. During that 10-year period, \nyou will have to demonstrate to us that you were, in fact, a person of \ngood moral standing, that you don't have a criminal record, that you \nwere working, you were paying your taxes, you were learning English, \nand you will pay a fine for having violated the law in coming to this \ncountry. At the end of that period, we will decide if you met these \nstrict qualifications and whether you can get on to a 5- or 6-year path \nto finally become an American citizen.\n\n  It is not an easy road. Some will fall along the wayside. Some will \nmake it. Those who make it will add something to America. They will \nshow that their determination to leave a place and come here has been \nmatched by the determination to stay here and make this a better \ncountry.\n  When I walk through the streets of Chicago--I love that city, the \ndiversity. When you get in a taxicab in Chicago, you will meet the \nworld. Every driver is from country after country, people who come \nhere--doctors, scientists, and others who are driving cabs and praying \nthey might become part of America. It reminds me of my own roots, and \nmy mother, who came from Lithuania. In 1911, when she arrived, could \nshe have ever dreamed that one day her youngest son would be sworn in \nas the 47th Senator from the State of Illinois? It was a dream she \nnever could have had, but it came true when she saw me sworn in before \nshe passed away. In my office is her naturalization certificate behind \nmy desk--a reminder of who I am and where I am from and, quite \nhonestly, where we are all from.\n  Yesterday, with the bill passed on a bipartisan vote, which now will \ncome to the floor of the Senate, we have an opportunity to do something \nthat is not only historic and fair but right, to make America a more \nsecure place, make certain there is fairness, and to make certain, as \nthe President said, that we maintain not only the lawful tradition in \nAmerica but the welcoming tradition in America. We can celebrate our \ndiversity, knowing that it makes us different than so many other \ncountries--countries that are now torn by sectarian strife and ethnic \nviolence. Thank God that in the United States, because there are so \nmany of us from so many different places, we have largely avoided that \nkind of confrontation.\n  I hope we will consider this bill on a bipartisan basis. We will need \nto tighten up some aspects and change a few words here and there. But \nwe can never go how the House of Representatives went, with the \nSensenbrenner bill; it is a punitive bill, a mean-spirited bill, not in \nthe best tradition of America. We can do better. It criminalizes 11 \nmillion or 12 million Americans. Calling them aggravated felons is no \nway to embark on this road to a more united America.\n  That law, as it passed the House, will never be enforced. We know \nthat. But\n\n[[Page S2433]]\n\nit is a shadow over the lives of so many millions--not just those here \nwithout documentation, but those who would reach out to help them, such \nas the priest who counsels the mother to stay with her children, even \nthough she may not have the right legal documents or the person at the \ndomestic violence shelter who tells a mother and her battered children \nto stay in this place; it is a safe and secure place for you; stay here \nuntil that abusive, drunken husband of yours is arrested and the kids \nare safe again.\n  Under the bill passed by the House of Representatives, the people I \nhave described would be branded not just as criminals but as felons. \nThat is an unfortunate approach and one that doesn't reflect the values \nof this country. That is an approach which would drive more people into \nthe shadows.\n  The Democrats support a comprehensive approach, one that includes \nsecurity and also includes a path to legalization--a tough, long path, \nwith many requirements that some will not finish. But those who do \nfinish will make a better America. We have to go beyond enforcement. We \nhave a reasonable and realistic approach to address the undocumented \nwho live among us. We would give them an opportunity, and that is the \nbest America can offer to anybody. By giving them this opportunity, we \nencourage them to come forward and register and to be part of the legal \nrolls in America. That way, we know who is living here, which enhances \nour national security. This is also true to American values. It is \nrewarding immigrants who work hard and play by the rules.\n  We face extraordinary security challenges in America today. We have a \nwar that now has claimed over 2,300 of our best and bravest--sons and \ndaughters of families across America, from Illinois and every State in \nthe union. Today, 138,000 American troops stand risking their lives for \nus in Iraq and another 20,000-plus in Afghanistan. We owe them not only \nour gratitude and our admiration, but we owe them a plan to come home.\n  When I take a look at the situation in Iraq, it deteriorates each day \nand moves inexorably toward a civil war, which we pray will never \nhappen, and I wonder how this will end. For some of us who voted \nagainst the resolution which brought us into this war, we argued at the \ntime that it is a lot easier to get into a war than to get out of one. \nWe argued that we needed more allies to stand with us so that it would \nnot be just American soldiers. We argued that more nations should be \nwith us in this effort so we would not be subsidizing a war, which now \ncosts us $2 billion a week.\n  Unfortunately, this administration moved forward, anyway. They went \ninto a war without enough troops, without enough body armor, without \nenough protection on the humvees, and without the necessary defensive \nequipment on helicopters. They sent the troops into battle and, sadly, \nso many have not come home. Many have come home with broken and \nbattered bodies.\n  We have an obligation now to say to the Iraqis: We have helped you. \nWe have removed your dictator. We have given you a chance to govern \nyourself, given you a chance for free elections, and we have given you \na chance for your future. But now it is your responsibility. Govern \nyour own nation; bring it together and defend your own people.\n  This administration promised us for years that, given enough time, \nthe Iraqi Army and the police force would replace our troops. How much \nlonger must we wait? How much longer must we wait until these Iraqis \nwill stand and fight for their own future and their own country? I will \nbelieve this administration has a plan that works when the first \nAmerican soldier comes home, replaced by an Iraqi soldier standing \nguard there in his own country. We are still waiting for that day. I \nhope it will come soon.\n  When President Bush said last week that perhaps we will have to wait \nuntil we have another President, 2\\1/2\\ years from now, my heart sank. \nTwo and a half more years of this? Two and a half more years of losing \nAmerican lives and watching these soldiers come back with visible \nscars?\n\n  We have to do better than that. Real security in America means a real \nplan to bring this Iraqi war to an end. I urge this administration to \nwork toward that day and toward that plan, on a bipartisan basis, and \nto work toward homeland security that makes certain we are safe.\n  The General Accounting Office reported yesterday there is the ability \nto bring across our border enough fissile material to make a dirty \nbomb, despite our border security. There is a lot more we need to do to \nmake America safe, and a stronger America begins at home.\n  This administration needs to do more when it comes to port security--\nnot turn it over to some foreign government to manage five major ports.\n  This administration needs to do more when it comes to security at our \nchemical plants and nuclear plants.\n  This administration needs to do more when it comes to protecting us \nand making sure our first responders have what they need. I was in \nMarion, IL, at the fire department meeting with Chief Rinella, talking \nabout the cuts in the Bush budget that will reduce the funds available \nto that department and to police departments, which we will count on if \nwe ever have a major challenge in the United States. Real security \nbegins at home, with an administration committed to security.\n  I urge my colleagues to join, on a bipartisan basis, to restore the \nfunds that were cut in the Bush budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I have to respond to my colleague from \nIllinois, who suggested that somehow the Iraqis are not standing up and \nfighting for the freedom of their country and the comment, ``How much \nlonger do we have to wait?''\n  Ask the Iraqi families of the men who were beheaded--30 of them most \nrecently--whether they are waiting for the Iraqis to step forward and \nsacrifice for their country. Ask the Iraqis who are in the military who \nare dying today, sacrificing for the freedom of their country, whether \nthey are waiting. The people of Iraq are stepping forward and fighting \nfor their country. We are helping them do that. It is the clear \nintention of our policy in Iraq to hand over the responsibility, and it \nis happening.\n  I find it almost remarkable that here now, 3 years into this \nconflict, where we are trying to transform an entire society, that the \nlevel of patience for this very difficult process, given all the \nprogress made and all the elections that have been held and the \nConstitution drafted--I think in all but four of the provinces, there \nis very little terrorist activity, or insurgent activity, or whatever \nyou want to call it. There is a concentration in a few provinces where \nthere are problems.\n  But I met with people from Mosul yesterday--elected officials--who \ncame here and talked about the dramatic improvements that are going on \nin that area, and the lack of any kind of al-Qaida operations and \nterrorist operations in that area, saying that life is dramatically \nadvancing. We don't hear talk about that. We hear talk about the \nproblem spots, and that is legitimate. But the idea that the Iraqis are \nnot fighting for their country, that they are not stepping forward--as \nwe see day in and day out that they are conducting missions and they \nare eliminating the terrorist threat in Iraq--I think it is almost \nincredible. I don't know how you can read the news and suggest that the \nIraqis are not stepping forward to defend their country and fight for \ntheir freedom.\n\n  Also, coming back to the issue of patience, I thank God sometimes \nthat some of the elected officials who are here today were not around \nin 1777, 1778, and 1779. We would still be singing ``God save the \nqueen,'' not ``hail to the chief.'' It took us 11 years to put a \ndemocracy together, in circumstances that I suggest were far less \ndifficult, in a neighborhood that was far less problematic than the \nneighborhood Iraq happens to be situated in. So the idea that we have \nlost our patience in a\n\n[[Page S2434]]\n\nstruggle against Islamic fascism, which is a real present danger to the \nfuture of the United States of America, to me, is almost \nunconscionable.\n  This is a struggle we are engaged in. This is a struggle for our \ntime. It is one that I believe history will look back upon and suggest \nthat we met the threat that would have fundamentally changed the future \nof the world, and we met it before it did so. We met it with strength, \nwith determination, and we overcame the doubters, overcame those who \nwould have rather cut and run. I am not for cutting and running when it \ncomes to the future security of this country. I have patience because \nthings that are difficult and meaningful take time. We have to give \nthat time.\n  I suggest there are some things that we are finding out now. Another \neffort I have been working on in Iraq is the intelligence information \nwe have been able to gather from the former regimes in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. This has been a project that Congressman Peter Hoekstra, \nchairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has been working on--and \nI have worked with him--to make sure these 48,000 boxes, containing \nroughly 2 million documents, are released to the American public and \nthe world to determine what was the intelligence assessment and the \nactivity level and, in particular, in Iraq with Saddam, and with his \ninteraction with elements of al-Qaida or other terrorist organizations.\n  What we are finding is that some of the statements that have been \nmade on the floor and statements that were made just as recently as \nMarch 19, 2006 by my colleague from Pennsylvania, Congressman Jack \nMurtha, who said:\n\n       There was no terrorism in Iraq before we went there. None. \n     There was no connection with al-Qaida. There was no \n     connection with terrorism in Iraq itself.\n\n  Yet if we look at some of the documents that are being released by \nDirector of National Intelligence John Negroponte--and, again, only a \nfew hundred of the millions of documents have been released. As a \ncaveat, while Congressman Hoekstra and I are excited about the fact \nthat DNI decided to release these documents, the pace of the release \nis, let us say, unsatisfactory to this point.\n  We have, with the blogosphere, the Internet, the opportunity to put \nthese documents out there and have almost instantaneously translated \npostings about what these documents contain.\n  During the time the Director of National Intelligence Negroponte has \nhad these documents--this is 3 years ago--less than 2 percent of the \ndocuments have been translated. At this pace, my grandchildren may know \nwhat is in these documents.\n  We need to get these documents out. Mr. President, 600 over a little \nover a 2-week period is almost the same pace as translating with the \npeople they had over in DNI Negroponte's shop. We need to get these \ndocuments out quicker. Why? Because if we look at what is in these \ndocuments, there is important information in understanding the \nconnection between Iraq and terrorist organizations and the threat we \nwere facing, the potential threat we had talked about, which is the \ncoordination between a country that had used chemical and biological \nweapons, was thought universally to have chemical and biological \nweapons, and terrorists who have expressed a direct desire to use those \nweapons and get access to them.\n  If we look at a report that was issued by the Pentagon Joint Forces \nCommand translating and analyzing some of these documents, called the \n``Iraqi Perspectives,'' on page 54, they write: Beginning in 1994, the \nFedayeen Saddam opened its own paramilitary training camps for \nvolunteers--this is 9 years, by the way, before the Iraq war--\ngraduating more than 7,200 ``good men racing full with courage and \nenthusiasm'' in the first year.\n  Mr. President, 7,200 in the first year, 1994.\n  Beginning in 1998, these camps began hosting ``Arab volunteers from \nEgypt, Palestine, Jordan, `the Gulf,' and Syria.'' Volunteers. I wonder \nwhy they would be volunteering to help Saddam. It is not clear, it \nsays, from the available evidence where are all these non-Iraqi \nvolunteers who were ``sacrificing for the cause'' went to ply their \nnewfound skills. Before the summer of 2002, most volunteers went home \nupon the completion of training. They didn't stay in Iraq. They came \nfor training from countries in the gulf regions, and they went home. \nOdd that they would be fighting for the cause which would, in that \ncase, be Saddam, if they went home.\n  Before the summer of 2002, as I said, most volunteers went home upon \ncompletion of the training, but these camps were humming with frenzied \nactivity in the months immediately prior to the war.\n  As late as January 2003, the volunteers participated in a special \ntraining event called the Heroes Attack.\n  Stephen Hayes, who deserves a tremendous amount of credit for his \nreporting on these documents in the Weekly Standard, has brought this \nissue to the forefront and has awakened Members of Congress, myself \nincluded, to the importance of discovering the content of these \ndocuments as well as some of the information contained in these \ndocuments.\n  He reminds us of the special significance of that training in 1998:\n\n       That is the same year that the U.N. weapons inspectors left \n     Iraq for good; the same year a known al Qaeda operative \n     visited Baghdad for 16 days in March; the same year the U.S. \n     embassies were bombed in East Africa; the same year the U.S. \n     bombed Baghdad in Operation Desert Fox; and, the same year \n     Saddam wired $150,000 to Jabir Salim, the former Iraqi \n     Ambassador to the Czech Republic, and ordered him to recruit \n     Islamic radicals to blow up the headquarters of Radio Free \n     Europe.\n\n  What we have here is, again, information that I believe is vitally \nimportant for the American public to see. I encourage Director of \nNational Intelligence John Negroponte to step up the pace. Congressman \nHoekstra and I have introduced legislation which would require just \nthat: it would require the release of these documents and provides a \nway to do so.\n  We introduced this legislation prior to the decision to release these \ndocuments, but, again, I just make the point that the pace with which \nthese documents are being released is inadequate. We need to continue \nto step that up, allow this information to get out for people to see, \npro and con--all the information that is available to us. These are old \ndocuments. They are at least 3 years old; in some cases much more than \nthat. The classified nature is specious, at best. We want to protect \nnames, obviously, if there are reasons to protect certain names because \nof potential fallout from having their names released. If there are \nrecipes for chemical weapons, fine. But the bottom line is most of this \ninformation should be released, can be released, and is not being \nreleased.\n  I assure my colleagues--and I think I can speak for Congressman \nHoekstra in this regard--we will stay on this issue, and we will make \nsure all of this information is made available to the American public \nso we have a better understanding of what the situation was in Iraq \nprior to the war.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I think everybody in this \nChamber should be interested in a comprehensive immigration reform \nbill, one that takes seriously the security of our borders, one that \ntakes seriously enforcing the hiring practices of employers, but also \none that makes sure we are providing a pathway to citizenship for the \n11 million to 12 million undocumented workers who are making enormous \ncontributions to this country.\n  The bill that came out of the Judiciary Committee last night strikes \nthe right balance.

Mr. President, I come to the Chamber today to address the \nethics bill that has been pending before\n\n[[Page S2435]]\n\nthe Senate for the past three weeks. It has now been exactly four \nmonths since Duke Cunningham resigned from the House after pleading \nguilty to bribery, tax evasion, and mail fraud charges. It has now been \nalmost three months since Jack Abramoff pled guilty to defrauding \nIndian tribes.\n  In the aftermath of both guilty pleas, Members on both sides of the \naisles in both Houses of Congress brought forward good proposals to \nchange the culture that led to these scandals, and yet here we are on \nMarch 28th with a half-finished ethics bill in the Senate and even less \nin the House.\n  I know there are many important issues facing our country--health \ncare, education, the war in Iraq, and, as I just mentioned, \nimmigration--but it is equally important that we as Members of Congress \nconsider how we are going to deal with the cloud of corruption that \nhangs over the Capitol and how that affects the issues which are \nimportant to the American people. For that reason, I sincerely hope the \nleadership of both parties will be able to reach an agreement to bring \nthis bill back to the floor before our next recess.\n  The American people are tired of a Washington that is only open to \nthose with the most cash and the right connections. They are tired of a \npolitical process where the vote you cast isn't as important as the \nfavors you do. And they are tired of trusting us with their tax dollars \nwhen they see them spent on frivolous pet projects and corporate \ngiveaways.\n  It is not a game that is new in this town. It is not particularly \nsurprising to the public. People are not naive about the existence of \ncorruption. They know it has worn the face of both Republicans and \nDemocrats over the years. So the hope is that we could find a \nbipartisan solution to the problem.\n  Before the recess, we made some progress on the ethics bill. I was \npleased to join with Senator Dodd on an amendment to ban Members and \nstaff from accepting meals from lobbyists. And when we get back to the \nbill, I will be joining Senators Santorum, McCain, Lieberman, and \nFeingold in offering an amendment to define the way we reimburse \ncorporate jet travel. I would like to spend a few minutes talking about \nthis amendment.\n  During the past 5 years, Members of Congress, Presidential \ncandidates, and political parties have used the corporate jets of 286 \ncompanies a total of more than 2,100 times. Despite the fact that a \nsingle flight of these jets can cost tens of thousands of dollars, the \naverage reimbursement rate has only been about $1,700 per trip. So far, \npoliticians have gotten away with this because current law only \nrequires us to reimburse the cost of a first-class ticket on these \ncharter flights, not the actual cost of operating the plane. But since \nwe are usually the only passengers on the plane who don't work for the \ncompany, this rule is effectively giving us thousands of dollars in \nunwarranted discounts. This has to change.\n  Let me say this to my colleagues: Although I discontinued the \npractice earlier this year, I have used corporate jets in the past. I \nknow some of the other proponents of this amendment have done the same. \nI know how convenient these charters can be. I know that a lot of my \ncolleagues, particularly those from large States, will oppose this rule \nchange because it makes it significantly more difficult and costly to \ninteract with their constituents who live in less populated parts of \ntheir States. So I am not unsympathetic to these concerns. There are \nmany parts of Illinois in which there is no commercial air service.\n  But this isn't about our convenience. It is about our reputation as \npublic servants who are here to work for the common voter, not the \nhighest bidder. We all know that corporations are not allowing us to \nuse their jets out of the kindness of their hearts. It is yet another \nway that lobbyists try to curry influence with lawmakers.\n  One lobbyist told USA Today about the advantages of allowing Members \nof Congress to use his jet. He said:\n\n       You can sit down and have a cocktail and talk casually \n     about a matter, rather than rushing in between meetings on \n     Capitol Hill.\n\n  A lobbyist for a telecommunications company is quoted as saying that \nproviding a jet to a lawmaker ``gives us an opportunity to form \nrelationships, to have a long stretch of time to explain issues that \nare technical and complicated. If it wasn't useful, we wouldn't do \nit.'' The vast majority of the people we represent don't have the money \nto buy that access and form those relationships. They don't have the \nability to fly us around on their private planes. In fact, they are \nhaving enough trouble paying the mortgage and their medical bills and \ntheir kids' college tuition. And they expect us to listen to their \nissues with the same concern we would any lobbyist or corporation with \na jet.\n\n  I know that some say that legislation isn't really being discussed on \nthese flights. But appearances matter. If we want to be serious about \nshowing our constituents that we are fighting for them--and not just \nfor the wealthy and powerful--we can't allow a small number of special \ninterests to be subsidizing our travel.\n  If there isn't enough commercial air service in a state and there is \na need to take a charter flight, then we should pay the full cost of \nthe charter. If there is not enough money in our Senate travel accounts \nto cover these costs, then we should increase our travel budgets. What \nwe shouldn't do is allow lobbyists to pick up the tab.\n  I know this may not be a popular amendment. I know many of my \ncolleagues will be inconvenienced if it is adopted; I will be as well. \nBut if we are serious about cleaning up the way we do business in \nWashington, it is an important step for us to take. I hope my \ncolleagues will do the right thing and support this amendment.\n  In closing, let me say it is obvious we are not going to be able to \nfinish ethics reform today. I know Senator Lott and Senator Dodd are \nworking diligently to try to get this bill back on the floor. I also am \naware of the importance of the immigration bill that we are going to be \nconsidering for the next two weeks. But I have to insist that we bring \nthis ethics and lobbying bill back to the floor as soon as practicable \nand that we get to work on getting a bill passed and sent over to the \nHouse. The American people expect us to take strong action to clean up \nthe way we do business in this city. They have been waiting for a long \ntime. It is time we got to work.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/28/senate-section/article/S2435-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2435-S2436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       LOBBYING AND RULES REFORM\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all of our \ncolleagues, we should be getting some indication from our leadership \nsoon as to when and how we will proceed on the lobbying and rules \nreform legislation. Of course, a major part of our time this week will \nnecessarily be involved in considering the immigration reform \nlegislation that was reported out of the Judiciary Committee on a \nbipartisan vote on Monday night. But I do think that we should go back \nto this very important issue also, which has been pending now for 3 \nweeks.\n  This is a bipartisan piece of legislation from two different \ncommittees. It is one of those rare but blessed occasions when \nRepublican and Democrat, chairman and ranking members, can work \ntogether. Senator Dodd and I worked together on this legislation, along \nwith Senator Feinstein and other Democrats, to shape the package that \ncame out of the Rules Committee. Senator Collins, the chairman of the \nvery important Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, \nwas able to get legislation out of her committee working with Senator \nLieberman of Connecticut. Good work is being done. We were making \nprogress and were about to get into a position where we could have \nwrapped the legislation up in a couple of days.\n  However, Senator Schumer proposed an amendment involving the Dubai \nWorld ports issue, and that caused the legislation to be stopped. That \nissue now is being dealt with by transferring the responsibility for \nthe operations of those terminals to domestic companies. So that issue \nis being addressed, for now. I believe Senator Schumer has\n\n[[Page S2436]]\n\nindicated that he is willing to withdraw his amendment, and we can go \nforward.\n  The pending business then would be the Wyden amendment on the issue \nof holds and how secret holds could be dealt with in this body. Some \nSenators have some concerns about the amendment. I would like for us to \nstep up and address that issue and work with our leaders. That is a \nRules Committee issue and I have held a hearing on the issue of holds. \nI support the Wyden-Grassley approach, but I think that when it \ninvolves rules that directly impact how the Senate operates day-to-day, \nthe leaders of our two parties in the Senate have to have major input \nin how we deal with the issue in the future.\n\n  There are other issues that are pending that have interest and \nsupport. Obviously, one of those is the amendment by Senator Collins \nand Senator Lieberman dealing with establishing a new Office of Public \nIntegrity. That issue was considered in their committee, and they would \nlike for it to be considered on the floor. I certainly understand that \nand would be supportive of that because it is supported by these two \nleaders of that committee. But we have 77 amendments filed as first-\ndegree amendments, most of which are not germane to the bill. So I have \nto ask my colleagues: Are we serious about lobbying reform and rules \nreform?\n  There are some good things in here. I don't support all of them, and \non a bill of this magnitude nobody is going to support all of it. But I \nthink we need to step up and resolve these issues. We do need reform in \nthe lobbying area and some changes in the rules especially in the area \nof disclosure. We also need a mechanism to deal with earmarks that have \nnot been considered by either the House or the Senate, and then are \ninserted in conference reports.\n  We are going to have to deal with all these issues sooner or later. \nWe can do it now or we can do it later. Some people I suspect hope this \nentire package of reforms will slide off the face of the Earth and \ndisappear. It is not going to. It is here, and it is going to come \nback. We can do it today if the leaders give us that charge or we can \ncome back to it later as filler or we can be the legislative yo-yo. But \nthis issue is going to be dealt with. I hope we can come up with a way \nto get it done even today, if possible.\n  We have actually lost a full day. We could have been working on this \nyesterday afternoon. We could have been working on it this morning. \nThere are other issues that are of interest and concern to the Members \nand to the leaders, so I understand how that goes. But if every Senator \npresumes to offer his or her amendment and demand a recorded vote, we \nwill not ever finish it. Maybe the American people are not that \nfocused. Obviously, when I was home I got a lot of questions about \nimmigration, about taxes, but I got one call, just one, about this \nbill. It was from somebody who was concerned about something they hoped \nwe would not put in the bill. Actually, it was a lobbyist, and I didn't \neven agree with what he was saying.\n\n  I think we should reconsider the cloture vote as soon as possible. I \nwill support it no matter at what point it occurs. We can consider two \nor three of these amendments or several of them or not. But we need to \nstep up to the issue, vote cloture, and complete this legislation as \nsoon as possible.\n  I ask my colleagues: Who wants to take the blame for not getting this \ndone? I was very disturbed about the way this was brought to a halt \nbecause I had yielded for what I was clearly told were going to be \ncomments and all of a sudden, we were hit with a second-degree \namendment that had no applicability to this at all.\n  We need to get together in a bipartisan way to address this issue, \nand we need to do it now. If we do not, somebody is going to have to \nexplain it. The way I will explain it is not going to be positive \nbecause we have a commitment and we need to go forward with it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/28/senate-section/article/S2436-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, let me begin my comments by commending \nthe Senator from Mississippi for his excellent statement. The Senator \nfrom Mississippi deserves great credit for working with his ranking \nmember, Senator Dodd, to craft a lobbying reform and disclosure bill on \nthe provisions that were under the Rules Committee jurisdiction. \nSimilarly, I worked very closely with the ranking Democrat on the \nhomeland security committee to come up with a bipartisan bill that \nreflects issues that are under the jurisdiction of the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  The result is a strong bill. We have married the bills reported by \nthe two committees on the Senate floor. We have produced legislation \nthat I think would help to restore the public's confidence in the \nintegrity of the decisions that we make in Washington. Some may ask: \nWhy does this matter? Why should we enact lobbying disclosure and \nreform legislation? The reason is, if the public does not trust us to \nmake decisions that are not tainted by undue influence from special \ninterests, then we will not, as a Congress, be able to tackle the major \nissues facing our country. If the bonds of trust between those we \nrepresent and public officials are so frayed, then we are not going to \nbe able to make the tough decisions, the hard choices that are \nnecessary when tackling the big issues and challenges that confront our \ncountry.\n  The issues before the Senate in this bill are pressing and serious. \nRecent scandals involving Jack Abramoff and former Representative Duke \nCunningham have brought to light the need for Congress to reevaluate \npractices that, although legal, raise questions about the integrity of \ndecisions that are made or at least create the appearance of conflicts \nof interest and undue influence. We need to ban practices that erode \nthe public's confidence in the integrity of Government's decisions. We \nneed to have greater disclosure of the amount of money spent on \nlobbying and how it is spent. I think sunlight is the best disinfectant \nin many cases, and providing and requiring greater disclosure will make \na real difference.\n  All of us here today recognize that lobbying, whether done on behalf \nof a business organization, an environmental cause, a children's \nadvocacy group, an educational institution or any other cause can \nprovide us with very useful information that does not dictate but does \naid our decisionmaking process. We should remember that lobbying \nactually has a noble history. The word comes to us from Great Britain \nwhen individuals would gather in the lobby of Parliament in order to \ntalk to members, and the medium of exchange was ideas and not favors.\n  Today, unfortunately, the word ``lobbying'' too often conjures up \nimages\nof all-expense-paid vacations masquerading as factfinding trips, \nspecial access that the average citizen can never have, and undue \ninfluence that leads to decisions not being made in the public \ninterest. The corrosive effect of that image on the public's confidence \nin the decisions that we make cannot be underestimated.\n  We in Congress have an obligation to strengthen that crucial bond of \ntrust between those in Government and those whom Government serves. \nThis legislation is a significant step in that direction, and we need \nto pass it promptly, without delay.\n  As my colleague, the Senator from Mississippi, has mentioned, there \nare some 77 amendments that have been filed to this bill. Many of them \nhave nothing to do with lobbying or ethics reform. Others only have a \nvery tangential connection. If we are serious about delivering lobbying \nreform legislation, if we believe that we need to clean up questionable \npractices, if we want to restore that bond of trust between the public \nand its elected officials, then we should move forward with this \nlegislation without delay,\n\n[[Page S2437]]\n\nwithout extraneous amendments that have nothing to do with the issue \nbefore us. We can do this bill with a good day of hard work.\n  I thank the majority leader for bringing up the bill again, for \nrecognizing its importance, and for working with the four managers of \nthe bill to try to find a path forward. But we need cooperation from \nour colleagues and from the leaders on the other side of the aisle if \nwe are going to be successful in doing so. I am convinced, as is the \ndistinguished chairman of the Rules Committee, that in a day's time we \ncan complete action on this bill and be on our way to conference with \nthe House if we have a little cooperation from our colleagues.\n  Let's not fail this test. Let's not fail to get this job done. This \nmatters. It matters because if we do not have the support of the \nAmerican people, the trust and confidence of the American people, then \nwe cannot tackle the major issues facing this country.\n  This bill would be a significant step forward in repairing the frayed \nbonds between the American people and their Government at a time when \nsurveys indicate that trust in Congress is perilously low.\n  I hope we can come together. This is a bipartisan effort. Senator \nSantorum convened a bipartisan task force that has worked very hard and \ngave rise to many of the bipartisan principles upon which this bill is \nbased. Let us work together on both sides of the aisle. We have \nbipartisan support. With the ranking Democrats, Senator Lieberman and \nSenator Dodd, with the two chairmen, Senator Lott and myself, we can \nget this job done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu).

CARD, JR.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to praise and thank Secretary Card \nwho, for the last 5\\1/2\\ years, served as Chief of Staff for the \nPresident of the United States. Those of us from New Hampshire, such as \nthe Senator in the Chair, know Andy Card well. Long before he became \nChief of Staff, before he became Secretary of Transportation, before he \neven went into the White House with the first President Bush, he was an \nindividual who had a fair amount of presence in New Hampshire. He \nstarted out in Massachusetts in the State legislature. There, with a \nsmall band of Republican members of that body in the 1970s, those of us \nwho were in government in New Hampshire had a chance to meet him on \noccasion as a neighbor and fellow legislator and member of the \ngovernment.\n  Then, in 1987, I believe it was, he came to New Hampshire and \nbasically took up residence on a cot in a rundown building that we used \nas the headquarters for the George H. Bush campaign for President. He \nwas the field director, the campaign manager under Governor Sununu and \nunder my father, Governor Gregg. He, at that time, created a tremendous \namount of goodwill amongst those who had a chance to work with him. He \nwas an extraordinarily highly capable individual who got his job done, \ndid it without ego but did it very effectively.\n  That approach, which grew with experience both as a Deputy Chief of \nStaff with the first President Bush and then as Transportation \nSecretary, and now as Chief of Staff since the beginning of this \nadministration--that approach of a quiet, confident, unassuming but \nextraordinarily effective individual has been really his modus \noperandi. He has really set a standard, I believe, to which Chiefs of \nStaff will be held as we go forward from administration to \nadministration.\n  The job of Chief of Staff is one of the most difficult jobs there is \nin Washington, obviously. It is a high-intensity position requiring \nworkdays that often run into 20 hours. It requires that you know all \nthe issues, that you know who the players are, that you put out the \nfires, that you communicate effectively, that you be courteous to \npeople who may not be so courteous to you, and that you deal \neffectively with getting the President of the United States the \ninformation he needs in order to do his job. Andy Card, as I said, set \na standard which will be one which I think Chiefs of Staff to come will \ntry to equal.\n  He is always fair. He is always open. He is low key, unassuming, \nextraordinarily effective but firm when he had to be on issues and with \npeople relative to carrying out the policy of the President. As he said \ntoday at the ceremony at the White House, he always recognized the fact \nthat he was a staffer. He was not an elected official as a Chief of \nStaff, but he was a staffer who worked for the President of the United \nStates and that his job was to carry forward the policies of the \nPresident. He did that extraordinarily well.\n  His wife, of course, has been with him all these years and put up \nwith the thousands of hours he has not been at home since he has done \nthis job--his wife Kathleene. As she has ministered to people who \nattend their church and others, she has certainly been a soulmate and \nperson of strength for Andy Card.\n\n  We bid him a sort of a bittersweet farewell in that I know he will be \nmissed in that position, but he has certainly earned the right to move \non to take some time for himself and his family, to be able to get up \nin the morning and be able to enjoy the day without having to know that \nhe will be rushing off for a 20-hour day at the White House.\n  I suspect he will be returning to New England. We look forward to \nhaving him back. I know he will spend a fair amount of time in \nMassachusetts and a fair amount of time in Maine, and I am sure he is \ngoing to stop on his way between Massachusetts and Maine to take \nadvantage of New Hampshire's ``no sales tax'' climate. He is a special \nperson, and the country has been well served by having him.\n  His successor, Josh Bolten, I have had the good fortune of dealing \nwith also for a number of years but especially in the last few years as \nDirector of OMB. In my role as chairman of the Budget Committee, he is \nobviously the person I have had the most contact with in the \nadministration. Interestingly enough, he brings a lot of the same \ncharacteristics to the job Andy Card does. He is low key, he is bright, \nhas a great sense of humor, and he understands that his job is to carry \nforward the mission of and purposes of the President.\n  He is a person you can talk to, who enjoys listening, will reach out, \nand does reach out for and has reached out as Director of OMB to \nMembers of the Senate to hear their thoughts and ideas as to how we \nshould proceed.\n  He has tremendous respect, I believe, on both sides of the aisle in \nthe way he has led the OMB, and he will create a seamless transition in \nthe White House as he moves over to the chief of staff job.\n  We are fortunate to have people such as this--people such as Andy \nCard and Josh Bolten who are willing to take on the obligation of \npublic service and serve in positions such as Chief of Staff for the \nPresident, jobs which are extraordinarily intense and involve \ntremendous sacrifice relative to family. But without good people such \nas this willing to do them, the Nation would be much less.\n  We thank Andy Card for his service. We wish him and Kathleene good \nluck and good fortune as they move forward, and we welcome Josh Bolten \nto the job.\n  I yield the floor.

Mr. President, I do not anticipate taking the full 15 \nminutes,\n\n[[Page S2438]]\n\nbut I did want to alert my colleagues to an amendment that I believe \nwill be coming up this afternoon, or perhaps even later this morning. \nIn any event, later today Senators McCain, Lieberman, and I will be \noffering an amendment to the ethics bill before us to create an Office \nof Public Integrity.\n  The American people view the way that we enforce ethics requirements \non each other and on our staff as an inherently conflicted process. We \nset our own rules, we are our own advisers, we are our own \ninvestigators, we are our own prosecutors, we are our own judges, and \nwe are our own juries. Even though we have some of our finest Members \nserving on the Ethics Committee, they cannot escape the perception that \nthe process is plagued by conflict of interest. We do have \nextraordinary capable, ethical individuals serving on the Ethics \nCommittee in the Senate. We are very fortunate to have a committee that \nworks in harmony and that takes its job very seriously.\n  I believe we can preserve the important role of the Ethics \nCommittee--and it is a vital role because the Constitution requires \neach House of Congress to discipline its own Members, if necessary, and \nwe are going to preserve that absolutely critical role--but that we can \nmake an improvement in the process by creating a congressional office, \nthe Office of Public Integrity.\n  I emphasize this is part of the legislative branch. We are not \ntalking, as some have, about creating an outside commission of judges \nand former Members of Congress and ethics experts. We are talking about \nrecognizing that the Constitution clearly places responsibility within \nthe legislative branch for taking actions, if necessary, against its \nown Members who violate the House or Senate rules. But we believe that \nprocess would be enhanced if we create an office of public integrity. \nIt would be headed by a director who would be appointed by the majority \nand minority leaders of the Senate. That office would conduct \ninvestigations of possible ethics violations independent of any direct \nsupervision by the Senate. So we would be assured that the public would \nperceive the process--the investigation--as more credible than now \noccurs when the Ethics Committee is investigating allegations against \ntheir colleagues.\n  I wish to point out, however, this is not the Shays-Meehan bill in \nthe House, whatever the merits of that approach. This is a different \napproach from that taken by the Senator from Illinois, Senator Obama, \nand it is even different from the proposal Senator Lieberman and I \nadvanced in the Homeland Security markup. We have refined it still \nfurther. We narrowed the authority of the Office of Public Integrity, \nand I think we struck exactly the right balance between the duties of \nthis office and the duties of the Ethics Committee. This office would \nconduct impartial, independent, thorough investigations and report its \nfindings to the Ethics Committee which then would retain authority to \nrule on the cases and allegations and decide what action, if any, is \ntaken. This would enhance the public confidence that this investigation \nwould be an independent one.\n  It is very difficult for us to investigate ourselves. There are \nfriendships, there are inherent conflicts of interest. The Ethics \nCommittee does a terrific job in the Senate. It has wonderful members \nserving on it, individuals of the highest integrity. But the public \nperception is always going to be that this is an inherently conflicted \nprocess because we are investigating ourselves. We are playing every \nrole in the process. What we are trying to do is create an office that \nwould conduct the investigation.\n  I know many of our colleagues are not comfortable with this concept. \nSome of them have compared it to the old special prosecutor laws. But \nthat is not what we are doing. We are very carefully setting up a \nsystem of checks and balances with the Ethics Committee retaining all \nof the final authority to decide how to proceed, to decide whether \nsubpoenas should be employed, to decide whether an investigation should \ngo forward in the first place, and to decide the ultimate disposition \nof the case. The investigation would be done by this independent \noffice.\n\n  I point out to my colleagues one of the advantages of having an \nindependent Office of Public Integrity conduct the investigation. The \npublic now is often skeptical of the findings and actions taken by the \nEthics Committee. If the Office of Public Integrity comes to the Ethics \nCommittee and says these allegations have been thoroughly investigated, \nwe, an independent entity, have investigated these allegations and we \nfind there is no truth to them, that finding is much more likely to be \naccepted by the public if the investigation is done by this independent \noffice. It would have complete credibility. That would be a great \nadvantage. It would remove the cloud of doubt and suspicion that often \nhangs over Members of Congress unfairly when allegations are made \nagainst them.\n  The reason the public often has those doubts is they know we are \ninvestigating ourselves. They know our colleagues are investigating \nallegations against their colleagues.\n  If we insert this Office of Public Integrity into the process, public \nconfidence in the thoroughness, independence, and credibility of the \ninvestigations would be enhanced. It would in no way diminish the \nauthority of the Ethics Committee to take the action, make the final \njudgments, and indeed judgments all along the way, on this case.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am hopeful that shortly the Senate will \nbe voting on a measure that will take a very significant step forward \nby bringing sunshine and public accountability to the Senate.\n  If you walk the streets of this country and ask someone what a hold \nis in the Senate, I don't think you will get 1 out of 100 people who \nwill have any idea what you are talking about. But the fact of the \nmatter is, a hold in the Senate is the ability to block a piece of \nlegislation, block a nomination from being even discussed in the \nSenate. As a result of a hold, the Senate will not even get a peek at a \ntopic that may involve millions of our citizens, billions of dollars, \nand affect the quality of life of citizens in every corner of the land.\n  It would be one thing if the Senator who exercises this extraordinary \ntool--this tool that carries so much power with it--if that Senator \nwould exercise the tool in public and could be held accountable. \nUnfortunately, holds are now placed in secret. They are done behind \nclosed doors. The sponsor of a piece of legislation will not even know \nabout it. It seems to me a Senate that is serious about lobbying reform \nabsolutely must stop doing so much of its important business in secret, \nbehind closed doors.\n  I will offer later in the day, I hope, with Senator Grassley, Senator \nInhofe, and Senator Salazar, an amendment to bring a bit of sunshine to \nthe Senate. It is an amendment that would not abolish the hold. \nSenators' rights would be fully protected. Senator Collins is in the \nSenate, and as a result of the colloquy we had several weeks ago, this \nlegislation also protects the Senator's right to be consulted on a \npiece of legislation. Certainly, that is something all Members feel is \nimportant. If there are bills that affect a Senator's State or that \nthey have a great interest in, that Senator would have an opportunity \nto study the legislation and to reflect on what it means.\n  What we say in this bipartisan amendment is when a Senator digs in, \nwhen a Senator plans to exercise this extraordinary power, the power to \nblock a bill or a nomination from ever being heard, we are saying that \nSenator has got to be held publicly accountable. What we require is \nthat a Senator who exercises a hold would have to so state in the \nCongressional Record. They could still use their procedural rights to \nmake sure they have a chance to oppose the legislation and to oppose it \nstrongly, but they would be identified as the person who was so \nobjecting.\n  The intelligence reauthorization bill is now being prevented from \ncoming to this Senate as a result of a secret hold.\n\n[[Page S2439]]\n\nA lot of Senators give lengthy and eloquent speeches about fighting \nterrorism, but now a bill that is vital to national security is being \nheld up in secret. It has been held up for months and months as a \nresult of this secret hold. That ought to change.\n  Certainly, it ought to change if Senators are serious about lobbying \nreforms because one of the best ways for lobbyists to work their will \nis to have procedures that help them behind closed doors. That is what \nthe secret hold is all about. It is written nowhere in the Senate \nrules, but it has become one of the most significant and powerful tools \na Senator can exercise. It is done without any public accountability at \nall.\n\n  There has been a bit of irony in the last couple of days about this \nlegislation. I thought it was going to come up already, given the fact \nthat we had come back from the recess. I was under the impression that \nwould be the first order of business. But we could not get to the \nbipartisan measure to abolish secret holds because, lo and behold, \nthere was a secret hold on an amendment to try to get the Senate to do \nits business in public. That pretty much says it all. Not only do we \nhave secret holds on national security legislation, legislation that \nwould make a real difference in terms of striking a balance between \nfighting terrorism ferociously and protecting civil liberties, not only \ndo we have national security legislation being held up, but even \nefforts to bring about basic reforms such as openness and sunshine for \nthe Senate are being held up as a result of this secret procedure.\n  I emphasize what the change will mean for the Senate. No longer if \nthis change is put in place will staff be able to keep secret from \nMembers an objection; no longer will leadership be the only one to know \nabout an objection; no longer will it be possible for a Senator to be \nkept in the dark about something they have worked on for years and \nyears. The fact is, Senator Grassley and I have worked on this \nlegislation for a full decade.\n  Senator Lott, the chairman of the Rules Committee, has been \nparticularly helpful in terms of working with us on this measure. There \nhave been hearings. Senator Byrd, who, of course, knows more about the \nSenate rules than anyone in the history of this Senate, has been very \nhelpful in terms of giving us background about what we ought to do. \nThis amendment puts the burden on the person who ought to be held \npublicly accountable: squarely on the shoulders of an objector. The \nperson who exercises a hold will be identified and colleagues can \ndiscuss with that person how to move forward in a bipartisan way.\n  No Senator is going to be stripped of their rights. No Senator is \ngoing to be kept from protecting constituents that have serious \nconcerns about legislation. But with the right to stand up for your \nview and to object to a piece of legislation, there ought to be some \nresponsibility. There ought to be some accountability.\n  I find it stunning the Senate would even consider lobbying reform \nwithout an effort to do its business in public. We have already spent \nseveral days on this legislation. Hopefully, it will be completed \nshortly. It seems to me one of the most obvious reforms that Senators \nought to be in favor of, if this Senate is serious about reform, is \ndoing its business in public.\n  Nowhere in the Senate rules does it say anything about secret holds. \nNowhere is it written down that a Senator can exercise this enormous \npower and do it without any accountability at all.\n  Senator Grassley and I believe it is time to bring some sunshine for \nthe Senate and for Senators to do the people's business in public. \nSecret holds have been the bane of the Senate for decades. Back in the \n101st Congress, then-majority Bob Dole said:\n\n       I have never understood why Republicans put a hold on \n     Republican nominees. Maybe I will figure it out some day. I \n     have been working on it. I have not quite understood it.\n\n  In that same Congress, former Senator John Glenn observed:\n\n       . . . as one hold would come off, there was agreement \n     another one would be put on, so that no one really had to \n     identify themselves. The objecting Senator would remain \n     anonymous. So much for sunshine in the United States Senate.\n\n  Those are the words of one of our most respected colleagues, John \nGlenn, words that I hope Senators will remember later in the day when \nwe will have a chance to vote on a bipartisan amendment to bring some \nsunlight to the Senate and some openness in the way the Senate conducts \nthe public's business.\n  When we have important national security legislation held hostage \ntoday by a secret hold, that alone says that this Senate needs to \nchange the way it does business. It ought to do its business in the \nopen. It ought to do its business in a way that will hold Senators \naccountable.\n  After 10 years, Senator Grassley and I have watched these secret \nholds block legislation, block nominations in a way that does a \ndisservice to all the people we represent.\n  We are going to have a chance to end this. We are going to have a \nchance to ensure that while Senators can exercise their rights and \ndebate topics that they feel strongly about, they can also be held \npublicly accountable.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

In fact, Dubai Ports World has \nagreed to sell its U.S. operations, and so it will have no control over \nthem. That will happen over the next several months. The administration \nhas agreed that should be what happens.\n  Obviously, we are going to keep a watchful eye on the deal, and \nshould for some reason--and I have no expectation this will occur--the \ndeal not be allowed, we would want to bring the amendment back to the \nfloor. The majority leader has graciously agreed that we would be \nallowed to do so, although I have no expectation that will happen.\n  So I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, let me add to what the distinguished \nSenator from New York just said. First of all, I thank him, through the \nChair, for his cooperation on an issue which is constantly evolving, \nbut it looks as if it is well underway to satisfy everybody's\n\n[[Page S2440]]\n\nconcerns. But the understanding is we will come back and address the \nissues in his amendment at some point in some way on the floor if that \nglidepath to satisfactory conclusion is not reached.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3176 to Amendment No. 2944\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there now be 2 \nhours equally divided between Senator Collins and Senator Voinovich or \nhis designee. I further ask unanimous consent that there be 20 minutes \nequally for debate between Senator Wyden and Senator Sessions or his \ndesignee. I further ask unanimous consent that following the use or \nyielding back of time the Senate proceed to a vote on the Collins \namendment, to be followed immediately by a vote on the Wyden amendment, \nwith no further intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, what we have done is cleared a way, with \none amendment and calling up other amendments, with the glidepath that \nwe will address two amendments shortly after our break for our policy \nlunches today. We, I think, can be on a glidepath thus of completing \nthe lobbying reform bill before addressing the border security and \nimmigration bills. Again, we have a lot of work to do, but that would \nbe the intent.\n  There is one remaining piece of business we need to address, in terms \nof the cloture vote that is scheduled for this afternoon, and I will, \nbefore lunch, have a further unanimous consent about that as well.\n  At this juncture, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We \nhave two amendments which will be debated. We set up to 2 hours. I \nwould think that time could be condensed. Further discussions will take \nplace over our lunches on lobbying reform. At a point in time, we would \nexpect after we finish with lobbying reform, we will go to the border \nsecurity bill, and we will have more to say about how that will all be \nhandled at a later date.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, further reserving the right to object, the \nlegislative business that is pending, what is the status of that, \nbefore the unanimous consent was made?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have had so much difficulty in getting an \nagreement to move forward on this legislation; we were not able to do \nit yesterday or this morning. I really hope that when we return from \nlunch, we go straight to the pending business and amendment. I would \nlike to accommodate all of our colleagues, but we have struggled so \nhard to get to this point, I would have to object.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleague from \nIllinois, in a bittersweet moment. One of our dearest friends from \nIllinois, Congressman Lane Evans, announced today that he will not be \nseeking reelection next term.\n  Since the day he arrived in Congress more than two decades ago, Lane \nEvans has been a tireless advocate for the heroes with whom he served \nand the countless other veterans who bravely defended this country. \nWhen Vietnam vets were falling ill from Agent Orange exposure, he led \nthe effort to pass Agent Orange compensation. Just recently, he led the \nfight to make sure the children of veterans exposed to Agent Orange who \nwere born with spina bifida would be taken care of as well.\n\n[[Page S2441]]\n\n  He was one of the first in Congress to speak out about some of the \nhealth problems facing Persian Gulf war veterans and has fought for \nbenefits for them ever since.\n  He fought to expand benefits to women veterans. He worked to help \nthose veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome, and also \nworked to make sure there is a roof over the heads of the thousands of \nhomeless veterans in our country today.\n  Lane Evans has fought these battles for more than 20 years, and even \nin the face of his own debilitating disease, Parkinson's, he has had \nthe courage to keep fighting. Today, veterans across America have this \nman to thank for reminding America of its duty to take care of those \nwho have risked their lives to defend ours. Today, we all thank Lane \nEvans for his courage in reminding us of this. His voice is going to be \nmissed in this town, but I am sure it will continue to be heard \nwherever there are veterans who need help or vulnerable people across \nAmerica who are looking for a hand up, not a handout.\n  Just a personal note: I don't know many people who are more \ncourageous than Lane Evans, who has worked tirelessly, despite \nextraordinarily challenging physical ailments. He is one of the most \ngracious, best humored, and hardest working people that I have ever \nseen.\n  I remember when I first started my own campaign for the Senate, he \ntook me around on a tour of his district. By the end of the day I was \nworn out because he was indefatigable in terms of his efforts. I \nconsider him not only a dear friend, but I think it is fair to say that \nhad he not supported me early in my election campaign I would not be \nhere today. So I think this is an enormous loss for the Congress, but I \nknow all of us will continue to draw inspiration from Lane Evans, and I \nam glad that he will continue to be my friend for many years to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, only a little over an hour ago, Lane Evans \nannounced he would not seek reelection in November to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. I understand his decision. It is a loss for his \ndistrict, for our State, and for America. From the Quad Cities to \nQuincy, Springfield, Decatur, Carlinville, and towns in between, Lane \nEvans is deeply respected and his service will be deeply missed.\n  For over 20 years, Lane Evans has stood as a beacon of hope and has \nbeen a strong voice in his Illinois congressional district.\n  There are two kinds of courage in this world. There is physical \ncourage, which is rare. Then there is even a rarer commodity, moral \ncourage. Once in a great while you find someone who has both. Lane \nEvans is that person.\n  He grew up in Rock Island, IL, the son of a union firefighter. He \njoined the Marine Corps right out of high school, served during the \nVietnam era from 1969 to 1971. After the Marines, Lane went to college, \nthen to Georgetown Law School. He was elected to Congress in a famous \nupset election in 1982.\n  For nearly a quarter of a century, the U.S. House of Representatives \nhad Lane Evans, former marine, as a Member of its body. He closed his \nannouncement today the way he closed many letters, with the vow: Semper \nFi. Semper Fi, those Latin words that mean ``always faithful.'' Lane \nEvans was always faithful--first to his fellow veterans. I can't think \nof another colleague in the House or Senate who worked harder for \nveterans, whether it was the Vietnam era Veterans Congressional Caucus \nwhich he chaired, his work with Senator Tom Daschle on Agent Orange, \nhis dogged efforts to find out what was behind Gulf War Syndrome, \nhelping homeless veterans, helping veterans find jobs, expanding VA \nhome loans, trying to find health benefits for veterans with post-\ntraumatic stress disorder, and, of course, working with the vets at the \nRock Island Arsenal.\n\n  Like others who served his country in uniform, Lane Evans was a man \nof peace. He worked to ban landmines which maim and kill thousands. He \nhung a portrait of John Lennon in his office, he said, because he \nthought John Lennon was often a better reminder than many people he met \nin Congress of the hopes of working-class young people for peace and \nfreedom.\n  What a champion for America's workers. After the Berlin Wall fell and \nthe Cold War ended, Lane Evans said we could not abandon workers at \nplaces such as the Rock Island Arsenal, men and women who helped to win \nthe Cold War. He fought for fair trade. He saw what happened in \nGalesburg when Maytag closed, costing 1,600 jobs. He fought to make \nsure America's workers were never left behind. And what a fighter for \nfamily farmers and for the environment, for the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge. He was cochairman of the Alcohol Fuels Caucus. He has \nbeen a leader in proethanol battles.\n  But, you know, he was a battler starting early in his career. As a \nlawyer he didn't take the easy way out to make a lot of money. He was a \nlegal aid lawyer. He fought for people who had no voice in the \ncourtroom, and he came to Congress to make sure everyone had a voice in \nhis congressional district. I have no doubt Lane would have been \nreelected again if he had chosen to run in November. Now he is fighting \na different kind of battle.\n  Nearly 8 years ago, Lane came out publicly and announced that he had \nParkinson's disease. It was a cruel blow. It turns out that I was with \nhim when he discovered it. We were in a Labor Day parade in Galesburg. \nHe was waving and he said he couldn't feel some of the fingers in his \nhand. He sensed something was wrong. It took a while for the diagnosis \nto come out. For a man that young to be diagnosed with Parkinson's is \nunusual. Publicly he announced his disease and started fighting--for \nstem cell research and for medical help for those who suffer from \ndiseases just like his.\n  During his last race, in 2004, he told audiences: I may be slow, but \nI still know which way to go. Living with Parkinson's made him a better \nCongressman because, ``I can understand what families are going \nthrough.'' Time and again, Lane Evans showed extraordinary courage, not \njust as a politician but as a human being.\n  His determination to serve his district pushed him to work harder, \neven as the burden of Parkinson's became heavier. His dignity and \nperseverance in the face of this relentless and cruel disease is an \ninspiration to every one of us who counts Lane Evans as a friend. In \nhis statement today, Lane Evans said:\n\n       I appreciate the support of people I never met before who \n     would ask how I was doing and tell me to keep up the good \n     fight.\n\n  The truth is, Lane Evans, his whole adult life, has been involved in \na series of good fights. Politicians come and go in the Halls of \nCongress, but this soft-spoken son of Illinois will leave his mark as a \nman truly committed to securing the American dream for everyone in our \nNation.\n  Thank heavens for Lane Evans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich).

Mr. President, would the Presiding Officer review the \ntime agreement that we are about to embark on for consideration of the \nCollins-Lieberman-McCain amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 hours evenly divided between the \nSenator from Maine and the Presiding Officer.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President. I was aware that was the case, \nbut I thought it would be helpful to our colleagues to better \nunderstand the state of play.\n  Mr. President, I made some preliminary comments this morning. I do \nwant to explain further the concept of the Office of Public Integrity, \nbut I know the Senator from Illinois had asked that I yield to him some \ntime. In the interests of accommodating his schedule, I yield 10 \nminutes to the Senator from Illinois to speak in support of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I thank Senator Collins, not only for her \naccommodation but also for her leadership on this issue. I also thank \nSenator Lieberman for his outstanding work on this issue.\n  I rise today to speak about the importance of improving the ethics \nenforcement process that we currently\n\n[[Page S2442]]\n\nhave. Last month I introduced legislation to create an outside \ncongressional ethics enforcement commission that would be staffed by \nformer judges and former Members of Congress from both parties. Under \nmy proposal, any citizen could report a possible ethics violation by \nlawmakers, staff, or lobbyists. My commission would have had the \nauthority to conduct investigations, issue subpoenas, gather records, \ncall witnesses, and provide its full public report to the Department of \nJustice or the House-Senate ethics committees.\n  I knew this proposal would not be the most popular one that I \nintroduced in Congress, but I didn't anticipate the deafening silence \nthat greeted it. Change is difficult and Members of Congress are \nunderstandably concerned about delegating investigations of their own \nconduct to an outside body, but I hope, when my colleagues learn a \nlittle more about the amendment I am offering with Senators Collins, \nLieberman, and McCain, that they will understand an independent ethics \nfactfinding body is not only a good idea but a necessary idea.\n  Earlier this year, I was asked by the Minority Leader to take a lead \nrole in crafting ethics legislation. I was glad to assume that role \nbecause I believe that the foundation of our democracy is the \ncredibility that the American people have in the legitimacy of their \nGovernment. Unfortunately, over the past few years, that legitimacy has \nbeen questioned because of the scandals we have here in Washington.\n  But one of the greatest travesties of these scandals is not what \nCongress did, but what it didn't do.\n  Because for all the noise we have heard from the media about the \nbribes accepted by Congressman Duke Cunningham, the thousands of \ndollars in free meals accepted by other Congressmen, and the ``K Street \nProject'' that filled lobbying firms with former staffers, we have \nheard only silence from the very place that should have caught these \nethics violations in the first place, the House Ethics Committee.\n  For years now, it's been common knowledge that this committee has \nlargely failed in its responsibility to investigate and bring to light \nthe kind of wrongdoing between Members of Congress and lobbyists that \nwe are now seeing splashed across the front pages. And the sad truth is \nthat the House ethics process does not inspire public confidence that \nCongress can serve as an effective watchdog over its own Members.\n  Time and time again over the past few years, the House Ethics \nCommittee has looked the other way in the face of seemingly obvious \nwrongdoing, which has the effect of encouraging more wrongdoing. In \nthose few instances when the committee has taken action, its leadership \nwas punished, and it ceased to become an effective body. Coupled with a \nFederal Election Commission that was deliberately structured to produce \ndeadlock, this has produced a dangerous outcome\n  In the words of one outside observer:\n\n       When everyone in Washington knows the agency that is \n     supposed to enforce campaign finance laws is not going to do \n     it and the ethics committees are moribund, you create a \n     situation where there is no sheriff. You end up in the Wild \n     West, and that's the context we've been operating under in \n     recent years.\n\n  Without question, the Senate ethics process is far superior, and I \ncommend my colleagues who have served--and continue to serve--\nselflessly and tirelessly on the Senate Ethics Committee. Indeed, I \nhave the greatest respect for Senator Voinovich and Senator Johnson. \nThey have done an outstanding job in a difficult task. They are two of \nthe finest people I have had the pleasure to serve with since I arrived \nin the Senate.\n  But here's the sad reality. No matter how well our process works here \nin the Senate, it doesn't really matter since the American people \nperceive the entire ethics system--House and Senate--to be broken. Our \nconstituents, unfortunately, do not distinguish between the bodies in \ntheir opinion of Congress. And as long as our credibility is stained by \nthe actions--and inactions--of the other body, then the legitimacy of \nwhat we do is also called into question.\n  With all due respect to my colleagues on the Senate Ethics Committee, \nthere's some good reason for the American people to be skeptical of our \nenforcement system. After all, we in the Senate are our own judge, \njury, and prosecutor. Under the current system, Members investigating \ntheir colleagues are caught in a bind. Either they investigate and \nbecome vulnerable to the allegation that they are prosecuting a Member \nfor political reasons or they do not investigate and it looks like they \nare just covering up for a colleague. That investigation trigger has to \nbe depoliticized for the good of Members and the integrity of the \nprocess.\n  And so, we can pass all the ethics reforms we want--gift bans, travel \nbans, lobbying restrictions--but none of them will make a difference if \nthere isn't a nonpartisan, independent body that will help us enforce \nthose laws.\n  That's why I come to the floor today to support this amendment for an \nOffice of Public Integrity. The office is the next critical step in the \nevolution of ethics enforcement in the Senate and vital to restoring \nthe American people's faith in Congress.\n  This amendment doesn't have quite the same level of independence as \nthe outside commission that I proposed setting up. But it does have \nmuch more independence than the current system, and for that reason I \nwholeheartedly endorse it and am proud to be a cosponsor.\n  The Office of Public Integrity established in this amendment would \nprovide a voice that cannot be silenced by political pressures. It \nwould have the power to initiate independent investigations and bring \nits findings to the Ethics Committees in a transparent manner. Final \nauthority to act on these findings would remain with the members of the \nEthics Committees, which would satisfy constitutional concerns.\n  Currently, in both the House and the Senate, the initial \ndetermination of whether to open an investigation has often resulted in \na game of mutually assured destruction--you don't investigate Members \nof my party, and I won't investigate Members of your party.\n  But what's interesting is that while there is often great \ndisagreement and sometimes even deadlock in the decision to open an \ninvestigation, there's usually general agreement on what the final \njudgment and punishment should be. That's because the development of a \nfull factual record can convince even the most ardent partisan that a \nMember of his own party should be disciplined.\n  In this sense, the OPI proposal is an admirable attempt to reform the \nmost troublesome aspect of the current ethics process while still \nretaining what works about it. Under this proposal, Ethics Committee \nmembers would be relieved of the most difficult part of their duties, \nwhich will make it easier for members to serve on the Ethics Committees \nand easier for them to carry out their responsibilities.\n  Most importantly, it would add much-needed credibility to the outcome \nof the process itself. By having the courage to delegate the \ninvestigative function to an Office of Public Integrity, the U.S. \nSenate would be sending the message that we have confidence in \nourselves and our ability to abide by the rules. That would be an \nimportant signal to send to the American people.\n  To put this in some historical context, a similar approach was \nendorsed by a Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress that was \ncochaired by Congressmen Lee Hamilton, a Democrat, and David Dreier, a \nRepulblican, in 1997. Representatives Hamilton and Dreier recommended \nthe establishment of an independent body to supplement ethics \ninvestigations through fact finding. Had that recommendation been \nembraced by the House then, it is possible that the recent House \nscandals could have been averted.\n  In the Senate, similar proposals have been suggested over the years \nby Senators Bond, Grassley, and Lott, as well as former Senator Helms. \nAnd state legislatures in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Florida, among \nothers, have established mechanisms to allow for independent input into \nethics enforcement.\n  Today, it's time for the Senate to take the lead, the same way it \ntook the lead in creating the first congressional Ethics Committee in \nthe 1960s.\n  In the end, the true test of ethics reform is not whether we pass a \nset of laws that appeal to a lowest common\n\n[[Page S2443]]\n\ndenominator that we can all agree on, it's whether we pass the \nstrongest bill with the strongest reforms possible that can truly \nchange the way we do business in Washington. That's what the American \npeople will be watching for, and that's what we owe them.\n  Enforcing the laws we pass is a crucial step toward reaching this \ngoal and restoring the public's faith in a government that stands up \nfor their interests and respects their values.\n  I commend, once again, Senators Collins and Lieberman for their \noutstanding work in the committee. I strongly urge my colleagues to \nsupport their amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for his \nsupport. He has worked very hard on these issues. I appreciate his \ncomments.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my partner and colleague from Connecticut, \nthe ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security, Senator \nLieberman, for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee, \nthe Senator from Maine, for her leadership generally on this bill and \nto say and it may be repetitious, what a pleasure it is to work with \nher and how proud I am of what our committee has accomplished in a \nthoroughly nonpartisan way under her leadership.\n  In that spirit, I am proud to join with Senator Collins as a \ncosponsor of this amendment and also pleased that Senators McCain and \nObama have joined us as cosponsors of this amendment. Senator McCain \ndeserves credit for having led, along with Senator Dorgan, the tough, \nindependent investigation of the Abramoff scandal that led to the \naction that I hope Congress will now take to reform our lobbying laws. \nSenator McCain introduced a very strong lobbying reform bill of which I \nam pleased to be the cosponsor.\n  Senator Obama has played a very important role in this debate on \nethics reform, introduced a very strong enforcement proposal of his \nown, and his support of this amendment is very important to Senator \nCollins and me.\n  The bottom line is the proposals that are in the Senate now that came \nout of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and \nthe Rules Committee do represent significant reform of our existing \nlobbying regulations and laws.\n  But there is a missing piece. The missing piece is enforcement, \ntaking steps to make sure that strong rules will be accompanied by \nstrong enforcement. That is exactly what this amendment does.\n  When our committee considered this subject; that is, the Committee on \nHomeland Security, Senator Collins and I put down a bipartisan mark \nthat would have created an Office of Public Integrity, a bipartisan, \nbicameral Office of Public Integrity, empowered to receive and oversee \nreports filed under the ethics rules in the Lobbyist Disclosure Act.\n  The Office of Public Integrity also would have had the authority to \ngive advice on compliance with ethics rules, the Lobby Disclosure Act, \nand the investigative violations of the ethics rules.\n  We were very anxious to respond to concerns that somehow this \nindependent Office of Public Integrity would become, as someone said, a \nrogue entity or violate the Constitution's mandate that each House of \nCongress determine its own rules and sanction its own Members when the \nfacts justify that, so we included a number of protections to ensure \nthat the office would be under the control of the Ethics Committee and \nthat the Ethics Committee would have final say on interpretation of the \nrules and on the question of whether the rules had been violated.\n  Some felt our proposal was meant to imply dissatisfaction with the \nSenate Ethics Committee and the job it has done. That was decidedly not \nthe case. The opposite is true. Rather, it reflected our decision that \nif we are aspiring to genuinely elevate, improve, and strengthen not \njust our lobbying regulations but the credibility and legitimacy they \nhave with the American people, whose faith has been undercut by so many \nrecent events in the processes here in Washington, including the \nAbramoff scandal and the conviction of a Member of the other body, \nrather, it reflects that belief that we have to act in a way to restore \nthat confidence.\n  One way to do that is to say not only are we adopting tough new \nlobbying laws, but we are prepared to create an independent office to \nenforce them.\n  That provision that was in the mark Senator Collins and I put before \nour committee was, in fact, removed by a majority vote of the \ncommittee. We have taken to heart the comments offered by our \ncolleagues. Today we offer this amendment in a form that we think \naddresses the most serious and frankly realistic and accurate concerns \nof our colleagues--not the speculative fears or truly rank \nmisunderstandings of what our intentions of the provision's unfortunate \namendment were, and it still provides the element of independence that \nwe need for ethics enforcement.\n  First, here are some of the questions. A number of people raised \nquestions about whether a bicameral Office of Public Integrity would be \nconstitutional. I believe strongly that our original proposal was \nconsistent with the Constitution's mandate that each House set and \nenforce its own rules. Nevertheless, in the spirit of accommodation, we \nhave changed our original amendment to make the Office of Public \nIntegrity a Senate-only office. That is what this amendment before the \nSenate today provides.\n  Second, we have responded to concerns expressed about the authority \nof the Office of Public Integrity as Senator Collins and I initially \nproposed it, to give advice and opinions on the ethics rules. Some of \nour colleagues in committee worried that the Office of Public Integrity \nand the Ethics Committee might give conflicting advice. Although we \nalways intended the Ethics Committee to retain ultimate interpretive \nauthority, the amendment we offer today eliminates the advice-giving \nfunction of the Office of Public Integrity, leaving it with the Senate \nEthics Committee.\n\n  Third, our original committee proposal assigned to the Office of \nPublic Integrity the responsibility for receiving, monitoring, and \nauditing filings under the Lobbying Disclosure Act. Improved compliance \nwith that act should be one of the goals of the reform package that is \nbefore the Senate. However, I know there has been objection to that, \nand at some point we may offer that as an independent amendment--in \nfact, one I think for which there will be less objection.\n  Fourth, we have left the responsibility of receiving and reviewing \nMember and staff financial disclosure statements with the Ethics \nCommittee. Under the proposal we offer today, the duties of the Office \nof Public Integrity will center on the initial review of ethics \ncomplaints.\n  These are good changes that respond to concerns expressed and still \npreserve the integrity and strength and independence of the Office of \nPublic Integrity. It would remain a nonpartisan, independent, and \nprofessional office headed by a full-time executive Director who would \nserve for a 5-year term. The Director would be appointed by the \nPresident pro tempore of the Senate, upon the joint recommendation of \nthe majority and minority leaders of the Senate.\n  The selection and appointment of the Director would be made without \nregard to political affiliation and solely on the basis of fitness to \nperform the duties of the office.\n  I have every confidence that, as called for by our proposal--this \namendment--the Director will be a person of integrity, independence, \nand public credibility who will have experience in law enforcement, the \njudiciary, civil or criminal litigation, or has served as a member of a \nFederal, State, or local ethics enforcement agency.\n  Our proposal will provide an important element of independence to the \ninitial stages of an ethics complaint, while still retaining the full \nauthority of the Ethics Committee. Let me walk through the process that \nwe propose.\n  Under our proposal, an ethics complaint may be filed with the office \nby a Member or an outside complainant, or may be initiated by the \noffice on its own initiative. Within 30 days of the filing of the \ncomplaint, the Director of the Office will make an initial \ndetermination as to whether the complaint should be dismissed or \nwhether there\n\n[[Page S2444]]\n\nare sufficient grounds to conduct an investigation. The subject of the \ncomplaint is provided the opportunity during that period to respond to \nthe complaint.\n  The Director may dismiss a complaint if he or she determines that the \ncomplaint fails to state a violation, lacks credible evidence of a \nviolation, or is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise de minimis in \nnature. In any case where the Director decides to dismiss the \ncomplaint, the Director may refer the case to the Senate Ethics \nCommittee so that the Ethics Committee may decide if the complaint is \nfrivolous.\n  On the subject of frivolous complaints, let me assure my colleagues \nthat we have provided strong safeguards. If the Ethics Committee \ndetermines that a complaint is frivolous, it may notify the Director of \nthe Office of Public Integrity not to accept any future complaint filed \nby that same person, and the person who filed the frivolous complaint \nmay be required to pay the costs of processing the complaint. Also, the \nDirector will not be allowed to accept any complaint concerning a \nMember within 60 days of an election. This so-called cooling-off period \nbefore an election will ensure that we do not attract politically \nmotivated complaints in the midst of competitive campaigns. Also, let \nme note that any member of the public can already file an ethics \ncomplaint with the Senate Ethics Committee, so in that respect our \nproposal continues current practice.\n  If during the 30 days the Director determines that there are \nsufficient grounds to conduct an investigation, the Director must \nnotify the Ethics Committee. The Ethics Committee may then overrule the \ndecision by a two-thirds, public rollcall vote of the committee, and \nthe committee must issue a public report. Thus, we preserve the \nultimate authority of the Ethics Committee even at this early stage \nwhile providing a greater measure of both independence and \ntransparency.\n  If the Ethics Committee does not overrule the decision of the \nDirector, the Director then conducts an investigation to determine if \nprobable cause exists that a violation occurred. If the Director \ndetermines that probable cause exists that an ethics violation has \noccurred, the Director must then inform the Ethics Committee, and, \nagain, the Ethics Committee may overrule the decision with a two-\nthirds, public rollcall vote of the committee which must be accompanied \nby a public report.\n  If the committee does not overturn the Director's decision, the \nDirector then presents the case to the Ethics Committee, and the Ethics \nCommittee makes the final decision as to whether a violation has \noccurred by a rollcall vote and a report that includes the vote of each \nmember.\n  If the Ethics Committee decides that a violation has occurred, the \nDirector will recommend appropriate sanctions to the committee. The \nEthics Committee, though, retains the final decision on whether \nsanctions will be imposed, what those sanctions will be, and whether to \ntake action itself or recommend sanctions to the full Senate for \nconsideration.\n  Our proposal does preserve the ultimate authority of the Ethics \nCommittee at every stage of the process while providing a much greater \nmeasure of both independence and transparency along the way. This is a \nway to give the American people confidence that we will have an \nindependent entity, watchdog, assisting Senators preparing the case \nbefore the Ethics Committee.\n  Finally, I note that, at the suggestion of Senator McCain, we are \nassigning to the Office of Public Integrity the role of recommending \napproval or disapproval of privately funded travel by Members and \nstaff. The reform legislation that is before the Senate, reported out \nof the Rules Committee, contains a new preapproval process for \nprivately funded travel. Giving this responsibility to the Office of \nPublic Integrity will, here again, assure the American public that \ntravel requests by Members of the Senate will be scrutinized by an \nindependent office. This proposal, in sum, will add staff and support \nto the Ethics Committee process and will add greater independence and \ngreater transparency. It is a sensible, sound, strong effort to assure \nthe American people we are not only adopting reforms in our lobbying \nregulations and laws, we are taking action to make sure those reforms \nare enforced.\n  I urge my colleagues to support our amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on the side of \nthe proponents?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 38 minutes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I expect Senator McCain will be on the \nfloor very shortly to speak in favor of the amendment. While we are \nwaiting for his arrival, let me make a few more comments on the purpose \nof this amendment.\n  Even though we are so fortunate to have the Presiding Officer as the \nchairman of the Ethics Committee and some of our finest Members serving \non the Ethics Committee, the fact is, that does not change the public's \nfrustration or doubt about the process. The public views the process as \ninherently conflicted. The public believes that investigations of our \ncolleagues by our colleagues raise obvious conflicts of interests.\n  No matter the incredible integrity of the Members who serve on the \nEthics Committee, they simply cannot escape that problem of public \nperception. That is why Senator Lieberman, Senator McCain, and I have \nattempted to come up with a new approach in our amendment that is \ndesigned to restore the public's confidence in the ethics system. We do \nso by creating the new Senate Office of Public Integrity. This office \nwould be headed by a Director, appointed by the President pro tempore \nof the Senate upon the joint recommendation of the majority and \nminority leaders of the Senate. This individual would have a 5-year \nterm and could be reappointed. This is not a lifetime appointment of \nsomeone who could somehow get out of control. This person would have to \nhave a background suitable for the position, and it would take a joint \nagreement of the majority and minority leaders to appoint the person to \nthe 5-year term.\n  I pointed out in my comments this morning that our proposal is not \nthe same as the proposal advanced in the House by Congressmen Shays and \nMeehan, regardless of the merits of that proposal. It is not the \nversion created or proposed by Senators Obama and Reid earlier. In \nfact, we have refined it from the proposal offered during the Homeland \nSecurity Committee's markup to try to accommodate some concerns that \nwere raised by the Presiding Officer. But what this proposal does is \nrecognize that the public does not have confidence in the current \nsystem.\n  We do not undermine the authority of the Ethics Committee. We \nrecognize and appreciate the hard work of the Ethics Committee, and we \nrealize the Ethics Committee alone should retain the ability to decide \nwhat sanctions may be appropriate for a Member who has been shown to \nhave committed some misconduct. The Ethics Committee is involved every \nstep of the way, as a safeguard, as a check or balance.\n  But I would ask my colleagues to consider allegations that may be \nraised against a Member and that are investigated by an independent \nOffice of Public Integrity. Now, that office comes back and says: There \nis no merit to these allegations. That judgment is going to be readily \naccepted by the public because it has been rendered not by a group of \nus sitting in judgment of our colleague but, rather, by an independent \nOffice of Public Integrity.\n  Again, if the Office of Public Integrity found grounds to continue \nthe investigation, found probable cause, conducted an investigation and \ncame to the Ethics Committee with its findings, it is the Ethics \nCommittee and not the Office of Public Integrity that has the decision \nto make on what sanctions, if any, are appropriate.\n\n  I think we have struck the right balance. I think we have sustained \nthe authority of the Ethics Committee, but we have also ensured that \nthe investigations will be carried out by an independent Office of \nPublic Integrity that would have the credibility to carry out this kind \nof sensitive investigation. After all, it is very difficult to \ninvestigate one of our colleagues.\n  We are fortunate because we know each other in this body. We have a\n\n[[Page S2445]]\n\ngreat deal of regard for one another. We are friends with the people \nwith whom we serve. All of that helps make the Senate a more collegial \nbody, helps us to get our work done. But it also raises questions in \nthe mind of the public about whether serious allegations are \nindependently and thoroughly investigated. I believe that is the \nadvantage of the approach we put forward.\n  This is a modest proposal. We are not suggesting the Office of Public \nIntegrity should provide rulings on ethics matters, providing advice. \nWe are not suggesting the Office of Public Integrity would decide \nsanctions to be imposed on Members. We build in that that is the job of \nthe Ethics Committee. We do not change that. But we do try to deal with \nthe perception that the current process is inherently conflicted.\n  Let me run through how the process would work. Essentially, the \noffice would do much of the investigative work that is now conducted by \nthe staff of the Ethics Committee, with the notable exception, which \nSenator Lieberman mentioned, of ruling on requests for privately funded \ntravel. The office would not provide advice or counsel. It would not \nissue advisory opinions. It would not have the power to enforce \nsubpoenas. It could not make public the product of its investigations. \nAnd it could not directly refer matters to Federal or State \nauthorities, such as the Department of Justice. All of those \nauthorities would remain with the Ethics Committee.\n  I make that point because, perhaps due to the many different versions \nof this concept, as advanced in the House or by outside groups or by \nother Members, there is a lot of confusion over the duties and \nresponsibilities of the Office of Public Integrity. So I want to make \nclear what the powers of this office would be.\n  What the office would do is accept complaints, and within 30 days of \nreceiving a complaint would make an initial determination as to whether \nthe complaint should be dismissed or whether an investigation is \nwarranted. If the office dismisses a complaint, it may refer the case \nto the Ethics Committee to determine if the complaint is frivolous and \nwhether sanctions should be imposed on the individual or the outside \ngroup filing the complaint. I think that is a big improvement on the \ncurrent system.\n  If, after the initial inquiry, the office finds sufficient grounds to \nopen an investigation, it would provide notice to the Ethics Committee. \nThe Ethics Committee would then have 10 days to overrule that \ndetermination.\n  I want to make that point very clear, that the Ethics Committee can \ndecide to overrule the decision of the Office of Public Integrity to \npursue the investigation further or the Ethics Committee could decide \nto take no action at all, in which case the Office of Public Integrity, \nhaving found sufficient grounds to open an investigation, would \nproceed. If the office finds probable cause that a violation has \noccurred, the Ethics Committee would then have up to 30 days in which \nto overrule that determination or let it stand. If not overruled, the \noffice then presents the case and the evidence to the Ethics Committee \nto vote on whether any rules or any other standards of conduct have \nbeen violated.\n  Again, you see that the Ethics Committee is involved at every single \nstage. There is a report from the Office of Public Integrity and an \nopportunity for the committee to overrule the Office of Public \nIntegrity. That opportunity is always available.\n  Mr. President, I do expect Senator McCain will be joining us shortly. \nIn the meantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous \nconsent that it be charged to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to, first, commend Senators Lott \nand Collins for bringing the underlying bill to the floor of the \nSenate. I know both worked extremely hard to pass their respective \npieces from the Rules Committee and the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee.\n  Second, I want to make one thing clear: I strongly support lobbying \nreforms that protect the integrity of our legislative process, close \nloopholes, promote moral/ethical behavior, and enforce our Senate \nrules. Any reforms that make sense that are not cosmetic should be \ngiven the strongest consideration by this body. I am particularly \npleased that this bill requires the completion of an ethics training \nprogram conducted by the Ethics Committee within 120 days of enactment \nfor current Members of the Senate and staff as well as requiring \ntraining for incoming Members and staff. It is not mandatory today. It \nis voluntary. This makes it mandatory, which is an improvement.\n  The Senate Ethics Committee professional nonpartisan staff already \nconduct numerous ethics lectures and seminars for the Senate community. \nThe Ethics Committee staff also regularly conducts training for \nindividual Member's offices upon request. In addition, the Ethics \nCommittee staff receives and responds to over 200 calls per week asking \nspecific questions about rules compliance. While I applaud the many \npositive aspects of the proposed lobbying reform bill, this amendment \nto create an Office of Public Integrity is off target and unnecessary. \nAs a member of the Ethics Committee for 8 years and chairman for the \npast 3, I oppose the proposed OPI because it will harm the Senate \nethics process rather than improve it.\n  If adopted, the OPI will introduce partisan politics into a process \nthat has been bipartisan. It is interesting to note that none of the \nsponsors of this OPI has served on the Ethics Committee, and all \nMembers of the Ethics Committee currently, and others, are opposed to \nit. By its very design, the OPI will simply replicate the tasks the \nEthics Committee does every day, including receiving complaints against \nMembers and staff and investigating allegations of misconduct. Given \nall the other duties of the Ethics Committee staff and the need for the \nEthics Committee to have its own counsel when reviewing the Director's \nrecommendation, there would not be any reduction in the staff of the \nEthics Committee. More importantly, the OPI would add a duplicate \ninvestigative stage because the Ethics Committee will need to conduct \nits own investigation to verify the merits of any complaint it receives \nfrom the Director of the OPI; otherwise, the Ethics Committee would be \nacting irresponsibly.\n  Some proponents of the OPI have argued that the Ethics Committee \ncannot or does not get the job done. They believe that a third party \nmust be appointed to ensure that nefarious acts are not committed \nwithin these walls. The fact that the Ethics Committee has an excellent \ntrack record of enforcement seems to have been forgotten by those who \nhave taken this position, although I must say that the Senator from \nMaine has been very complimentary to the chairman of the Ethics \nCommittee and the work we are doing. I am appreciative of that.\n  Other OPI proponents argue that despite the great work of the Ethics \nCommittee, the appearance of Senators enforcing our rules on other \nSenators is a problem that OPI will fix. Some of this criticism appears \nto be based on the fact that Members of the Ethics Committee and its \nstaff are obligated to keep matters confidential. We can't talk to \npeople about things. It is easy for critics to point and sneer when the \ncommittee and its members are obliged to confidentiality and are \nprohibited from responding to questions and criticism. Frankly, I \nbelieve it is the Ethics Committee's commitment to keep matters \nconfidential that causes some to question the effectiveness and values \nof the Ethics Committee. However, it is this confidentiality that \nprovides due process protection for Members and staff and keeps \npartisan politics out of the ethics process. These confidentiality \nprovisions provide due process protection for Members while keeping \npartisan politics out of the ethics process.\n  Nevertheless, if a colleague acts in a way that is contrary to the \nrules of conduct of the Senate, the Ethics Committee has the ability \nand the duty to investigate the allegation, and it does\n\n[[Page S2446]]\n\nso. Right now we have a right to initiate investigations without a \ncomplaint. In terms of reading something in the newspaper, something \nbrought to our attention and it seems like it casts a bad reflection \nupon the Members of the Senate, we have often sent letters off to \nSenators saying: We have seen this. We want you to respond to it.\n  Frankly, that is why the proposed OPI is somewhat offensive. It \nsuggests that Members lack the moral conviction to make difficult \ndecisions when a fellow Member has acted in violation of the Senate \nrules.\n  While sitting in judgment of one's peers is never easy, the Ethics \nCommittee conducts itself with a sense that the reputation of the \nSenate is above any individual Member. In my opinion--I hope my \ncolleagues will agree with me after considering this amendment--the OPI \nand its independent counsel is more cosmetic and, frankly, problematic. \nIt seems as if proponents of the measure understand that as well. In \nfact, proponents of the OPI offered a much more robust proposal during \nthe markup of the lobbying reform bill in the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. The proposal was soundly defeated in a \nbipartisan manner. Recognizing all of the other flaws in the earlier \nproposal, this amendment strips away all of the other elements of the \nearlier proposal to offer nothing more than the creation of an \nindependent counsel within the Senate.\n  Frankly, I am confused. On the one hand, one would believe that in \noffering this amendment, faith in the Senate Ethics Committee would be \nlow. However, the scaled-back version of the OPI suggests that the \nproponents recognize the Senate Ethics Committee is doing its job but \nstill want to force this independent counsel on the Senate for no \nreason than to appease the media, frankly, and some of the watchdog \ngroups. I keep hearing the public doesn't have any confidence in the \nprocess. There have been complaints about what has happened over in the \nother House. But the fact is, to my knowledge, we have not had \ncomplaints about the work of the Senate Ethics Committee. Certainly, I \nhaven't heard any complaints from any of my constituents about this \nwork, and I am chairman of the committee.\n  Despite the misunderstandings and commentary by various groups, the \nEthics Committee is already a vigorous enforcer of Senate rules. The \nEthics Committee and its 11 professional, nonpartisan staff, including \n5 nonpartisan attorneys with many years of prosecutorial and \ninvestigative experience, are there to initiate investigations based on \ncomplaints from Members and staff, outside individuals and groups, as \nwell as on its own initiative. What I am saying is, if this stuff comes \nto the attention of the staff, they go out and do the investigation. \nThey look into the matter. They bring it to us and ask us: Do you think \nwe should go forward. It is not as though we are controlling what they \ncan do. That is one of the things the proposal for the independent \ncounsel doesn't recognize. They are already in a position to do that. \nWe are proposing to do what we are already doing.\n\n  With the assistance of this professional nonpartisan staff, the \nSenate Ethics Committee is doing exactly what our colleagues and the \nAmerican people should expect of us--protecting the integrity of the \nSenate and vigorously pursuing and sanctioning Senators and staff who \nviolate the rules of the Senate. I have not heard any evidence to the \ncontrary.\n  The tradition of the Ethics Committee doing its job is a long one. \nFor over 40 years, the Ethics Committee has operated in a way to meet \nthe constitutional mandate that each body establish rules, investigate \nits Members for disorderly behavior, and hand out appropriate \npunishment. The Ethics Committee continues to meet this mandate today, \nand it does so in a bipartisan manner. In fact, published accounts \nreveal that the Ethics Committee has considered allegations involving \nsome 35 Senators, all but 3 of which occurred after 1977.\n  While these Members include only public allegations, frankly, this \nreveals that the Senate Ethics Committee has not had the problem of \npartisan gridlock that has affected the House ethics process. If we \ncreate a Senate OPI, however, I can almost guarantee the Ethics \nCommittee will become partisan and gridlocked, especially in the \npresent political environment.\n  This is also why all six members of the Ethics Committee, three \nRepublicans and three Democrats, oppose creation of the OPI. Over the \nyears, the Ethics Committee has benefited from a bipartisan working \nrelationship. This positive working relationship could be quickly lost \nunder this new independent counsel. Moreover, the OPI appears designed \nto result in conflict and disagreement between the Ethics Committee and \nthe Director of the OPI.\n  First, Members should understand the three-stage process that has \nbeen proposed under the OPI and understand why this proposal would ruin \nthe bipartisan nature of the system as well as creating an adversarial \nrelationship between the Ethics Committee and the Director.\n  At each stage of the OPI process, if the Director, prosecutor, \nindependent counsel, or whatever you want to call him or her, \ndetermines that he or she believes there are sufficient grounds to \nconduct or proceed with an investigation, then the Director would \nnotify the Ethics Committee. The Ethics Committee then has the \nopportunity to overrule the determination by a two-thirds vote. But if \nthe Ethics Committee disagrees with the Director and votes to overrule, \nthe Ethics Committee is required to issue a public report which would \ninclude a record of how each Member voted. While this OPI amendment \ndoes not specify what should be included in these public reports, as a \npractical matter, these public reports will include the Member's name, \nfacts about the alleged misconduct, and the rationale for rejecting the \nDirector's recommendations. By requiring the public report, a Member's \nname will be disclosed even if the Ethics Committee determines there is \nno violation of the rules.\n  I think this new public reporting process will turn the existing \nSenate ethics process into a political public relations battle rather \nthan a determination on the merits of each matter. What's more, the \nDirector is not likely to be happy that the Ethics Committee disagreed \nwith his or her conclusions.\n  If you bring it in, talk about it, and then if you disagree with \nindependent counsel and you have a vote, this will go back and forth. \nThen Members will start worrying about how they are voting in terms of \nthe fact that they disagreed with the independent counsel's decision. \nThen we get into the issue of your votes in terms of various Members \nwho are before the committee and having Members in your own caucus \ncoming up to you and saying: Why did you vote that way or why didn't \nyou vote this way? These considerations are not part of our \ndecisionmaking today. This is a nuance that I think many people don't \nunderstand. That is how we keep this.\n  People ask me about cases, and I say ``no comment.'' The media asks, \nand I say ``no comment.'' Once the name is out there, Katey, bar the \ndoor--especially today, unfortunately, in this partisan, political \nenvironment.\n  I want to take a second to point out something that is obvious but \nmay be overlooked in this debate. Issuing a subpoena to a Member of the \nSenate is a very serious matter, and Members know it. The heart of the \nsubpoena power is a big stick that the Ethics Committee must \noccasionally use to enforce information requests during an \ninvestigation. The subpoena power is used judiciously. This power \nshould not be delegated lightly as the OPI proposes to do.\n  Proponents of the OPI also suggest that the Director of the OPI will \nbe responsible and answerable to the Ethics Committee throughout the \nprocess. In fact, this Director would not be answerable and responsible \nthroughout the process. After the Ethics Committee approves the \nDirector's initial decision to begin an investigation, the Director \nwould have the unchecked power to investigate. These investigations may \ngo on as long as the Director, in his or her sole discretion, sees fit.\n  We all know that independent of any power to sanction, the power to \ninvestigate is itself an awesome power and may itself impose on the \nsubject of the investigation a heavy burden to his or her resources, to \nhis or her reputation, to his or her ability to represent and serve \nconstituents fully and effectively. The OPI amendment would resurrect \nthe independent counsel in the\n\n[[Page S2447]]\n\ninstitution of the Senate. This would serve neither the interests of \nthis institution nor the public.\n  Finally, inherent conflict between the Ethics Committee and the \nDirector, as I mentioned, is built into the way this determination is \nmade.\n  Advocates of the OPI state that the process would remove politics \nfrom the ethics process. I can guarantee you that by creating this \nindependent counsel, politics would not only play a part in the ethics \nprocess but would be a decisive factor to every inquiry. Members of the \nEthics Committee would have to explain why they voted the way they did \nto the media, their colleagues, and party members. Partisan \nconsiderations will transform a now bipartisan decisionmaking process \ninto another partisan battle. The Senate has had enough of some of \nthese partisan problems.\n  I also find it troubling that Members believe it is better policy to \nturn over the investigative process to an unelected and unaccountable \nindividual rather than leaving such an important responsibility with \nMembers who respect the Senate as an institution and are accountable to \nthe voters every 6 years.\n  I also want to take a step back and discuss another reason proponents \nof the OPI claim it is necessary. Throughout the entirety of the recent \nscandals, reports appear that cast doubts upon the integrity of \neverybody on Capitol Hill. There is a belief that the Senate Ethics \nCommittee was asleep at the wheel--or even worse, indifferent to the \nallegations in the Abramoff-related matter. As detailed in the \ncommittee response to Democracy 21, which is posted on the Ethics \nCommittee Web site, the committee voted to follow its general practice \nof not initiating an investigation that might interfere with an ongoing \nDepartment of Justice criminal investigation. We keep hearing \ncomplaints from Democracy 21 and others that ``you guys should be \ninvolved in the Abramoff case.'' We discussed it and decided to follow \nthe procedure we followed in the past. The Justice Department said: \nKeep your nose out of this. Let us do our work. When we are done, we \nwill come to you.\n  We had the same case in terms of Senator Torricelli. He was under \ninvestigation--this is public knowledge--by the Justice Department and, \nfor some reason, they decided not to prosecute him. They sent the stuff \nto us after they did their investigation. By the way, it was helpful to \nus because we had the Justice Department investigation before us. As a \nresult of that, we censured as a public admonition of Senator \nTorricelli. He decided not to seek reelection to the Senate. So I just \nwant you to know that the opposition to this is a bipartisan \nopposition. People who have been around here and have been through the \nprocess understand that we are getting the job done.\n  One other thing that I think will help is annual reports. As you \nknow, right now we don't have to report what we do. People at home come \nup to me and say: What are you doing?\n  I say: I am chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee.\n  They say: What about it?\n  I cannot talk about it.\n  What do you do?\n  I cannot talk about it. There is no record on this, and I put out an \nannual report every year and cannot talk about what we have \naccomplished.\n  We have an amendment that we got in the committee, when it was marked \nup, that says we will report each year everything that we do. Members' \nnames will not be mentioned, but at least the public will know that we \nare doing our work and we are not just sitting there letting everything \npass us by. I am not sure that is going to satisfy some of the public \ninterest groups, or that it will satisfy some of the media who have \ntaken shots at me editorially because they think we are trying to hide \nsomething.\n  But the fact is, we are trying to get the job done. We must preserve \nthe reputation of this Senate. So I want to say that I think the \ncreation of the OPI is not a positive step forward and, in fact, it \nwould diminish the job that is being done in the Senate to enforce our \nethics laws and rules.\n  Mr. President, I reserve my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Arizona, who is a key supporter of the amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Maine. I will not take all of \nthe 10 minutes. I would like to begin by thanking her and Senator \nLieberman for their very hard work and their dedication to trying to \nfix a problem that perhaps some of my colleagues may not be aware of, \nand that is our reputation as a body is suffering rather significantly \nin the view of the American people.\n  I view this amendment by the Senator from Maine as a way to help the \nEthics Committee do its job because the questioning has been: Why \nhaven't people been investigated? If you had a body that would help \nthem determine whether a case is worthy of further investigation and \npursuit or not, it seems to me it would relieve the Ethics Committee of \nsome of the onus of making tough decisions when we are talking about \nour colleagues.\n  I was interested in the comment by the Senator from Ohio that he \nwon't investigate until after the Abramoff thing is done by the Justice \nDepartment. The Abramoff thing would not have been investigated by the \nJustice Department if it had not been for the Indian Affairs \ninvestigation; and while the Justice Department began and continued the \ninvestigations, we continued our hearings on the Abramoff case. If I \nmay say, with a bit of ego, the Indian Affairs Committee contributed \nquite a bit to the information they needed in order to pursue this not \nunprecedented but egregious case of corruption of the system, staff, \nand Members. Really remarkable things happened under Mr. Abramoff. So \nsomehow we on the Indian Affairs Committee were able to have an \ninvestigation--the little, obscure Indian Affairs Committee.\n  But the fundamental point is that we need to restore the confidence \nof the American people in the way we do business. Hardly a day goes by, \nor at least a week, that there is not a major story about influence of \nspecial interests, wrongdoing, or certainly ethical questions that are \nraised. That is the kindest way that I can describe it. We need to fix \nthe problem. So why not give this to the body of the Senate that is \ncharged with these onerous obligations.\n  I sympathize with anybody who is a member of the Ethics Committee \nbecause tough decisions have to be made and most of us are friends \nhere. That is very tough.\n  So why would it be harmful? And why would it not be helpful to have \nan Office of Public Integrity with a mission that would be carefully \ncircumscribed, which, if they made a decision, could be overruled by a \nvote of the Senate, and would be helpful in clearing up sometimes a \ncloud of investigations such as those that characterized the 1980s and \n1990s, particularly in the other body where there were charges launched \nand there were partisan vendettas which many people called ``the \ncriminalization of partisan differences.''\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues recognize that when our approval \nratings are down around 25, 26 percent, and there are people who \ncontinue to be deeply disturbed about the way we do business--whether \nor not it is legitimate, the perception is out there; you can look at \nany public opinion poll--should we not do what we can to help fix \neither a real or imagined problem that we have with the people we \nserve?\n  It seems to me that an Office of Public Integrity that would \nrecommend appropriate action taken by the Ethics Committee, not by the \nOffice of Public Integrity such as has been recommended by this \namendment, would be helpful to the Ethics Committee process, helpful in \ncarrying out and determining whether these are partisan, unwarranted \ncharges, or whether those are legitimate.\n  I want to point out again that this is a legitimate difference of \nopinion. The Senator from Maine and I, and others, including Senator \nLieberman, have a view that this is necessary. Others think it is not. \nCan we calm down a little bit? This is a legitimate subject of debate \non whether we need it. I hope we can discuss this, but I also believe \nthat if you don't do this, what are we going to do? What are we going \nto do to try to restore some of the confidence that the American people \nhave clearly lost in us?\n  Obviously, a functioning Ethics Committee, with a level of \ncredibility with\n\n[[Page S2448]]\n\nthe American people, is something I think would contribute to healing \nthis breach that has developed between us and the people we represent.\n  I thank the Senator from Maine and Senator Lieberman and others for \nthis bipartisan effort. I would like to say a word about the so-called \nwatchdog groups. I think they do a lot of good. They have done a lot of \ngood for this body and for this Nation. There are people who are \nconcerned about public integrity. There are people who bring issues \nbefore us and the American people. They are legitimate. I may not agree \nwith them all the time, but I think to view them as adversaries, \nfrankly, in my dealings with them they have been helpful. They \ncertainly were in various investigations in which I and my committee \nhave been involved, and also with reform efforts in which I have been \ninvolved. I, for one, appreciate their work and the dedication they \nhave to giving a better Government to the American people.\n  Again, I thank Senator Collins for her hard work, and I appreciate \nher efforts. I appreciate her and Senator Lieberman's bipartisan \nstewardship of one of the most important committees in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nSouth Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the pending McCain-\nCollins-Lieberman amendment to create an Office of Public Integrity. I \nthank my colleague from Ohio, Senator Voinovich, who serves as chairman \nof the Senate Ethics Committee. I serve as vice chair. This is a \ncommittee that has three Republicans and three Democrats, and it has a \nhistory of close bipartisan cooperation.\n  I applaud Senator Voinovich's observations about the Abramoff scandal \nand the fact that the Department of Justice has an investigation that \nis ongoing. The Department of Justice actually has requested the Ethics \nCommittee not to begin its own investigation for fear of jeopardizing \ncriminal charges that may or may not be brought by DOJ, and we also \nrecognize a much greater investigative capability and the importance of \nnot duplicating efforts. So I appreciate Chairman Voinovich's \nobservations in that regard.\n\n  I thank Senators Collins, Lieberman, Lott, and Dodd for their efforts \nto bring to the floor this bipartisan lobbying reform legislation and \ntheir ongoing work to complete this important bill. I support the bill, \nand I believe many of the reforms we are debating are long overdue.\n  As vice chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee, I am hopeful we can \ncontinue to work in a bipartisan manner to pass this legislation, \nconference the bill with the House, and enact these much needed \nreforms.\n  I must say as an aside, while these reforms are much needed, the \nunderlying truth is, I believe the greatest share of problems this body \nfaces is due to a separate issue, that of campaign finance, but that \nwill have to be taken up in a different context and different \nlegislation.\n  Unfortunately, I rise today to oppose the pending amendment. I know \nmy colleagues have offered this amendment in an attempt to improve the \nethics process and because they believe in good faith that the creation \nof a new Office of Public Integrity, or OPI, will address perceived \nshortcomings in the operations of the Ethics Committee. However, I am \nconcerned this amendment attempts to fix something that, frankly, is \nnot broken and will, in fact, have a detrimental impact on the Senate.\n  As a relatively new member of the Ethics Committee, I do not have an \nentrenched loyalty to that committee. If I believed the committee was \nnot taking its duties seriously or was acting in an irresponsible \nmanner, I would be the first to call for a new approach. The truth is, \nI believe the Senate Ethics Committee operates effectively and in a \nbipartisan fashion. However, the members of the committee and its staff \nare obligated to operate under strict confidentiality, which I believe \nsome of our colleagues and certain outside groups equate with inaction. \nThis simply is not the case. To the contrary, the committee serves \nSenate offices in an advisory role, investigates matters of concern, \nand enforces the rules of the Senate on a daily basis. But to provide \ndue process protections and to ensure professionalism, most of the \ncommittee's actions are confidential.\n  I believe the Members who have had interactions with the Ethics \nCommittee appreciate this professional approach which further \nencourages Members and their staff to seek the prior advice of the \ncommittee and avoids many potential problems.\n  I recognize this perception of inaction must be addressed in order to \nrestore public confidence in the ethics process. I thank the chairman \nof the Ethics Committee, Senator Voinovich, for offering an amendment \nduring the markup of this bill that will allow the Ethics Committee to \npublish annually on a no-name basis a report detailing the activities \nof the committee. I believe this is an important step and will give our \ncolleagues and the public a better idea of the committee's operations.\n  I wish to spend a few minutes discussing my concerns about the \namendment itself.\n  First, I believe there are significant constitutional issues \nsurrounding the creation of an independent Office of Public Integrity. \nThe Constitution gives the Senate the authority to establish its own \nrules and to punish its own Members. An Office of Public Integrity that \nis outside the Senate would violate this section of the Constitution, \nas well as the speech and debate clause. As a consequence, such an \noffice would never be able to acquire the information or compel the \nnecessary testimony to investigate rules violations, keeping in mind \nthat each Member of the Senate is subject to the same criminal laws as \nevery other citizen of America but beyond those laws also must comply \nwith the ethics rules we have internally in the U.S. Senate.\n  An Office of Public Integrity that is set up within the Senate to \navoid these constitutional issues, as I understand the current \namendment as drafted, would merely duplicate the Senate Ethics \nCommittee, would be a waste of resources, and would not solve the \nproblems the sponsors perceive to exist. The two-tiered ethics process \nthat would be created by this amendment would undoubtedly slow \nconsideration of ethics complaints, create more doubt about the \nprocess, and make our colleagues and the public less confident in our \nability to address these issues.\n  I am also concerned about the practical operations of an Office of \nPublic Integrity. As I understand the amendment under consideration, \nthe Office of Public Integrity would take over most of the \ninvestigatory functions of the Senate Ethics Committee. When an ethics \ncomplaint is received, the Office of Public Integrity would \npreliminarily investigate the matter, and if grounds for further \ninvestigation are found, the matter would then be sent to the Senate \nEthics Committee for approval. The decision to continue the \ninvestigation could be overridden by a public two-thirds vote of the \nEthics Committee with a required public report on the matter. If \napproved, the matter would be referred back to the Office of Public \nIntegrity for further investigation.\n\n  At the conclusion of the investigation, if the Director of the Office \nof Public Integrity determines that there is probable cause that an \nethics violation has occurred, the Director would, once again, send the \nmatter to the Ethics Committee and, once again, this determination \ncould be overridden by a public two-thirds vote of the Ethics Committee \nwith a mandatory public report. Assuming the Ethics Committee did not \noverride the Director's determination, the Office of Public Integrity \nwould then present the case to the committee for a final ruling and \nimplement any sanctions. Regardless of the committee's decision on the \ncase, the amendment would require the committee to issue a public \nreport at this stage of the process.\n  I fail to see how this process of ethics cases bouncing back and \nforth between the Office of Public Integrity and the Ethics Committee \nwill improve in any way the way ethics complaints are handled. Instead, \nthe amendment would create more bureaucracy and a more belabored \nprocess.\n  In addition, it is not clear if the underlying ethics complaint would \nremain confidential during this process. The amendment contains a \nprovision prohibiting the Director or the staff of\n\n[[Page S2449]]\n\nthe Office of Public Integrity from disclosing any information about a \ncase unless authorized by the Senate Ethics Committee. However, I do \nnot know how information will remain confidential when cases are being \nreferred back and forth between the Office of Public Integrity and the \nEthics Committee, especially when the amendment specifically requires \nthe committee to issue public reports. This leaves open the possibility \nthat Members will be forced to live under the cloud of an investigation \nas a result of every accusation brought before the Office of Public \nIntegrity, regardless of its merit--regardless of its merit. Such a \nsituation would only interject more partisanship into the ethics \nprocess and create a blunt tool for extreme partisan groups to make \npolitically based attacks.\n  I have no doubt that my colleagues have offered this amendment with \nthe best of intentions and based on their belief that this Office of \nPublic Integrity would improve how we do our business in the Senate. \nOnce again, if I believed the Ethics Committee process was broken or \nthat the proposed Office of Public Integrity would, in fact, improve \nthe mechanism for considering ethics complaints in the Senate, I would \nsupport that amendment. However, I know the ethics process is working \nin the Senate.\n  To address the perception of inactivity which is the result of the \nSenate's confidentiality rules, the bill does contain important \nlanguage to mandate that the committee report in broad terms its \nactivities, which will provide greater transparency to the committee's \naction.\n  It is my hope that my colleagues will listen to the concerns about \nthis amendment expressed by the current and past members of the Ethics \nCommittee who best understand the committee operations and will join us \nin a bipartisan fashion opposing the McCain-Collins-Lieberman \namendment.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I yield up to 5 minutes to Senator Stevens.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-one minutes.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. How much time does the Senator need?\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-one minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to express my concerns regarding \nthe creation of the Office of Public Integrity. We discussed this \nproposal in committee, and I joined a bipartisan group of Senators in \ndefeating it, and rightly so.\n  The proposed Office of Public Integrity would duplicate the efforts \nof the Senate Ethics Committee. Our Ethics Committee was established \npursuant to the Constitution, which states each body of Congress must \nmake its own rules. This office would, in effect, replace--or \nduplicate--the current rule of the Senate.\n  The implication the sponsors here make is that in order to restore \npublic confidence, we have to create something new. I do not think we \nshould replace the Senate Ethics Committee, nor do I think we should \nimply that our current system is not working.\n  I happen to have been the target of complaints to the Ethics \nCommittee, and I can tell you it has a qualified staff headed by a very \ncapable chairman and ranking member who have the public's trust.\n  As a matter of fact, I once chaired this committee, and believe me, \nit is a difficult and thankless job, but one Chairman Voinovich is \ndoing very well. If the Ethics Committee process is broken, we should \nfix, it. We should not create another layer of bureaucratic red tape \nand ask American taxpayers to pay $2 million a year to fund it.\n  What's more, I am concerned that the Office of Public Integrity could \nbe used as a partisan, political tool. The climate in Washington today \nis the most partisan I have experienced in my 37 years in the Senate, \nand we should think carefully about offering up another tool for \npartisan critics of either party to abuse. Under this proposal, \naccusations don't have to be verified, those making accusations are not \nunder oath. This proposal will add another layer to what is already a \nvery expensive process. Who will pay those costs? A Senator could face \nmultiple accusations presented to this OPI--and the Senate Ethics \nCommittee. The costs of legal assistance in such instances will be \ndoubled.\n  In my judgment, this proposal points us in the wrong direction, and \nit's a slap in the face to Chairman Voinovich and Senator Johnson, and \nall past chairmen for that matter.\n  I have some concern about this amendment. I can state, as President \npro tempore of the Senate, I would have a series of duties under this \namendment subject to being told exactly what to do by the two leaders \nof the Senate. However, as I view this amendment, it does not create an \nentity that makes any decisions.\n  I think the Senator from South Dakota is absolutely correct. The \nimpact of this amendment would be that the Director of this office \nwould become the investigatory arm of the Senate Ethics Committee. As a \nmatter of fact, once the Director gets a complaint, he then has to make \nrecommendations to the Senate Ethics Committee. The Senate Ethics \nCommittee either approves or denies the recommendation. In terms of the \ninvestigation concept, the complaint with the Office of Public \nIntegrity is not made under oath, it is not made under normal \nprocedures.\n  I agree with the Senator from South Dakota, I don't know how the \nSenate has the authority to create an independent body that is spending \ntaxpayers' money that has the job of duplicating the investigatory arm \nin the Senate Ethics Committee. We have a Senate Ethics Committee \ninvestigating group, and it does a very good job.\n  I happen to have been chairman of the Ethics Committee in the past, \nand I have also have been the subject of investigation by the Ethics \nCommittee. I can assure my colleagues they do a good job. I can also \nassure my colleagues that it costs a considerable amount of money to \ncomply with the inquiries of an ethics complaint. All this does is set \nup another entity that also will cause more attorney's fees and more \ntime of the Senator to deal with the problem of someone having \npresented a complaint against him.\n  If the Director decides to dismiss a complaint, it goes back to the \nSenate Ethics Committee. They decide whether it is frivolous. The \nDirector doesn't make that decision. Again, it is back to the \ncommittee.\n  I don't understand the Senator from Arizona saying this is supposed \nto take the workload off the Senate Ethics Committee. To the contrary. \nI agree with the assertion that has been made that I don't know of any \nSenator who would serve the Ethics Committee under this rule. I \ncertainly would not. Whenever the Director determines there are \nsufficient grounds to conduct an investigation, he notifies the Senate \nCommittee on Ethics, and the committee may overrule that. In other \nwords, there is nothing this Director does without going back to the \nEthics Committee and burdening the Ethics Committee. Under current \nSenate rules, the Ethics Committee can continue to investigate \ncomplaints presented to it. They have the procedures and they have the \nrules. They would have to follow them if the complaint was directed to \nthat committee. There is nothing in here saying you can only present a \ncomplaint to the Director of this Office of Public Integrity.\n  If the Director determines there is cause to proceed further, what \ndoes he do? He goes back to the Senate Ethics Committee and says that \nis his determination. The Ethics Committee then has the right to vote \non that. I don't know how we are restoring public confidence in the \nsystem if we create an investigatory arm that comes back to the Senate \nEthics Committee every time it wants to do something. They are the \npeople who make the decisions now, and the process is working.\n  I don't understand because of some complaints from public interest \ngroups that the process is not working, mainly because--I applaud the \ninitiative of Senator Voinovich and Senator Johnson and the decision by \nthe committee to publish a report. I think that is a good one. That is \na complaint that was heard back in the days when I was chairman of the \ncommittee. We, by nature, kept those decisions within the\n\n[[Page S2450]]\n\nSenate, except when there was a final decision made. I was here when \none Senator was censored and one other expelled from the Senate because \nof a Senate Ethics Committee investigation.\n  Whatever decision is made, whether the office is going to refer \nsomething to the Department of Justice, what do they do? The Director \ncomes back to the committee and tells them the Director thinks it \nshould be referred to the Department of Justice, and then the Senate \ncommittee votes on whether it should go to the Department of Justice.\n  I tell the Senate, from my point of view, the Constitution gave us \nnot only the right but the duty to create our own rules, and the rules \nwe have--and they are very important--are the rules concerning our \nethics. They are enforced internally by the Senate itself.\n  The decisions made under this amendment would be no different than \nright now. The final decision will be made by the Senate Ethics \nCommittee. All this really does is find a way to further publicize that \ncomplaints have been made.\n  I know it says if there is a frivolous complaint made, then this \nDirector can say you cannot present the complaint any longer to the \nOffice of Public Integrity. There is nothing barring them from \ncomplaining to the Senate Ethics Committee again. The Senate rules are \nthere. Anybody can file a complaint with the Senate Ethics Committee, \nand they are reviewed by very fine staff.\n  I have to tell my colleagues, if we take the action to create \nsomething in the public--call it Office of Public Integrity--and it has \nno teeth, how have we restored confidence in the system? This is not a \nway to restore confidence in the system. The way to restore confidence \nin the system is for Senators to stop repeating rumors about the \nSenate, to stand up and say: The Senate has integrity and the Senate is \ndoing its job.\n\n  The Senators who serve on this Ethics Committee--and believe me, I \nremember trying to get someone to take my place. It took a long time to \nfind someone to take my place because we had just gone through a long \ninvestigation of a Senator, and it was really a bitter period of time \nfor the Senate Ethics Committee. No one wanted to serve on it anymore.\n  This is going to present a situation where no one will serve on this \ncommittee. Why would they do it? They have someone, a director, who \ncomes to them and tells them the director thinks some Senator has done \nsomething wrong. The Senate votes. Then what do they do? If he \ndisagrees, then they publish it. What good does that do? The problem is \nthe integrity of the rules. And I think, serving on both this \ncommittee--and I have been the chairman of this committee also, and the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee--these are heavy \nburdens, to carry out these responsibilities.\n  The Senate Ethics Committee is a heavy burden. It takes more time \nthan any Senator who hasn't served on the committee can possibly \ndetermine. Talk about reading. You have to read depositions, go through \nfiles; enormous time is put into this. What are we going to do now if \nwe create this Office of Public Integrity? Someone else is going to do \nthe investigations and bring it to the committee and say: What do you \nthink about this? Guess what. In the final analysis, there is one \nsection that says, in any event, the committee will comply with the \nSenate rules. So the whole body of Senate rules and the precedent \nbehind Senate rules are still in place, but we create a new Office of \nPublic Integrity on top of it to start the investigations. The \ninvestigatory process of the Senate Ethics Committee is a very unique \none, and I urge the Senators to at some time read that rule and read \nthe precedents under that rule which are set forth in the publication \nthe Senate Ethics Committee has made.\n  I agree we have to restore public confidence, but this is one aspect \nthat destroys public confidence because it says you cannot have \nconfidence in the investigatory side of the ethics process. There is \nnothing that says you can't have confidence in the committee itself \nbecause every final decision in this process is still made by the \nSenate Ethics Committee. That, to me, is not an improvement at all of \nthe process.\n  Furthermore, we ought to take into account the situation that exists \nright here in Washington, DC, now. In the 37 years I have been in the \nSenate, I have never seen such partisan people outside of the Senate on \nboth sides accusing Members of the Senate. It is part of the political \nprocess now, it is not part of the ethics process. We have people \naccusing us almost daily of having done something wrong and publishing \nit through blogs and all that. I think we should be very careful in \nsetting up another tool for these bloggers and these people to use to \ncreate more news, to create more charges against the Senate. So I urge \nthe Senate to vote against this amendment and keep confidence in our \nown rules and our own procedure.\n  It is my hope the Senate will follow the example of the Majority of \nthe Rules Committee and the Governmental Affairs Committee. We will \nclosely scrutinize this and other amendments before us.\n  I cannot support an amendment that either replaces the Senate Ethics \nCommittee or adds another layer to our already expensive and time-\nconsuming process. I urge the Senate to defeat this provision.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I yield time to the Senator from Utah. \nHow much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-one minutes.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I yield 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have heard the arguments, and I agree \nwith most of them. I simply want to put it all in perspective.\n  Let us remember that the Senate Ethics Committee, under the man who \nis currently the assistant majority leader, the majority whip, Senator \nMcConnell, censured the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, a \nmember of Senator McConnell's own party. The Senate Ethics Committee is \nnot a namby-pamby, rollover, protect-the-party kind of institution. Let \nus remember that the current Democratic leader, the Senator from \nNevada, was on the Ethics Committee when it censured a member of his \nown party with sufficient strength to cause that Member to recognize \nthat he could not possibly seek reelection.\n  There would be those who would say: Oh, Senator Reid will protect the \nDemocrat. Senator Reid will see to it that the decision of the Justice \nDepartment, which said he had not violated a law, would be sufficient \nand would give him appropriate political cover. Senator Reid did not do \nthat. Instead, the Ethics Committee came out with a statement so strong \nthat the Senator in question withdrew himself from the election.\n  Again, the Senator from Kentucky, when he was chairman of the Ethics \nCommittee, came out with statements so strong that the chairman of the \nSenate Finance Committee--in some people's view, the most significant \ncommittee assignment anyone could have in this body--was forced to \nresign.\n  Let us not listen to those who say the Senate Ethics Committee does \nnot do its job and needs some kind of a watchdog--some kind of a \ngatekeeper, if you will--that will go out and gather those accusations \nwhich the Ethics Committee has not properly examined. Let's create the \nSenate version of the independent counsel.\n  The Independent Counsel Act came after Watergate, as people reacted \nto the Watergate scandal and said: We need a counsel who is independent \nof all politics. They don't recognize that the people who ended up with \nthe prosecutions and the convictions that sent members of the Nixon \nadministration to prison were not people connected with an independent \ncounsel; they were people out of the Justice Department. Let us \nremember that when the President tried to do things with the Justice \nDepartment that were viewed as being protective of him, there were \nindividuals who refused to accept appointment, who resigned from the \nJustice Department rather than carry out a partisan agenda. We are \ngetting the independent counsel mentality here of the same kind. There \nhas been a scandal. Jack Abramoff has broken the law.\n  I agree with the comment made by the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. \nNelson, who said: Washington is the only place I know where, when \npeople break\n\n[[Page S2451]]\n\nthe law, our reaction is, change the law, make the law tougher.\n  Jack Abramoff is going to go to prison, and he is going to go to \nprison under the old rules. He is going to go to prison under the \nexisting laws. That doesn't say to me that the existing rules and the \nexisting laws somehow failed. What failed is that Jack Abramoff failed \nhis moral and integrity responsibility to abide by the law, not that \nthere was something wrong with the law.\n  So we had the Independent Counsel Act after Watergate, and we saw \nwhat happened. When the impeachment trial here in this Chamber was \nover, Senator McConnell and Senator Dodd, the chairman and ranking \nmember respectively of the Senate Rules Committee, both went upstairs \nto the press gallery and both said: It is time to kill the independent \ncounsel statute. The independent counsel statute has gone too far, it \nhas created too much partisanship, it has created too much difficulty. \nA bipartisan call, and this body agreed, and the independent counsel \nstatute lapsed, with no tears being shed for it in this body.\n  Now there is a sense that somehow, in response to the Abramoff \nscandal, we must do the same thing that was done in response to the \nWatergate scandal. If we do this, at some future point, the future \ncounterparts of Senator McConnell and Senator Dodd will go to the \ngallery and say it is time to kill the Office of Public Integrity.\n  Let's go back to the way things make sense. We have heard all of the \nexamples from all of the Senators as to the way this would work and the \nway it would make sense. I oppose this amendment, and I hope all of the \nMembers of the Senate will do so as well.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Again, the time remaining, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I yield the Senator from Arkansas up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I commend Senators Collins and Lieberman on \ntheir great work on this underlying bill. I am on the Homeland Security \nCommittee with them, and it is always great to work with them. They \nwork in a very nonpartisan and bipartisan fashion.\n  Also, I wish to thank Senator Voinovich and Senator Johnson for their \nleadership on the Ethics Committee on which I also serve. They have \ndemonstrated what being real Senators is all about because they take \ntheir responsibility on ethics very seriously, and I am here today to \nsupport their position on this amendment and to oppose this amendment.\n  The Ethics Committee works with diligence and without politics. I \nhave only been on this committee for a little more than a year, and I \nwill be the first to tell you that there is a problem with the House \nEthics Committee. I think everybody agrees on that. But also, I am \nadamant to say that there is really not a problem at all on the Senate \nEthics Committee because we take our responsibilities very seriously. \nWe are there to protect the Senate, the integrity of this institution, \nand, just as the Constitution says, we are there to oversee the \nbehavior of our colleagues. We do that in a very confidential manner.\n  I must say that it is sometimes frustrating to outside forces who \nlook and see us, and they may file something and they may not get an \nimmediate response.\n  I remember when I was starting out practicing law in Arkansas, a \nlawyer told me: Never try your case in the newspaper. I think that is \nvery true when it comes to the world of ethics inside the Senate. If we \nallow the confidentiality to go away, then, in my view, we would be \nopening a Pandora's box. I can just imagine--again, in today's \nrealistic political world--I can just imagine what it would be like if \nsomeone were to file a complaint and the next thing you know, there \nwould be radio ads, television ads, Internet ads, blogs, et cetera, out \nthere saying that so-and-so has ethics charges pending against him.\n  The Senate Ethics Committee, although not perfect, is a much better \noption than the Office of Public Integrity. Again, I believe that is \none of the reasons this amendment or something very similar to this was \ndefeated in the committee on a bipartisan basis.\n  I also notice that there are groups around Washington, DC, who are \nvery supportive of the Office of Public Integrity. Basically, one of \ntheir complaints is that when they file a complaint with the Senate \nEthics Committee, the complaint seems to go in a black hole. In fact, I \nhave an e-mail that says we--the Ethics Committee--ignore outside \ncomplaints. Nothing could be further from the truth. I am here to tell \nyou, nothing could be further from the truth. We consider all the \ncomplaints, wherever they come from, very seriously. We look at them, \nand we act on outside complaints, complaints that come from outside \nthis body. We have spent a lot of time--hours and hours, in fact--on \ncomplaints that originated outside this body.\n  Also, I think some of these groups say they acknowledge that the \nHouse has a problem with their Ethics Committee, but they say that both \ncommittees are in need of repair. Really, they can't point to anything \nin the Senate Ethics Committee that has gone wrong or any way that we \nfailed on the Senate Ethics Committee. There is a reason for that. You \ncan look back over the last 20 years, and you will see a number of high \nprofile, very difficult, very tough, and oftentimes very complicated \ninvestigations the Senate Ethics Committee has undertaken which have \nled to some sort of admonishment of their own Members in the Senate.\n  The last thing I wanted to say, is this: Being on the Ethics \nCommittee, every day when I walk in that room, I ask myself, what did I \ndo to make Harry Reid mad? Why did he put me on this committee? Because \nI will tell you, as the chairman will or as the cochairman will tell \nyou, it is not an easy assignment. In fact, it is grueling.\n  One thing we need to understand is that oftentimes, to get down to \nthe facts and to get down to the truth, it takes time. It takes a lot \nof time. Sometimes you have witnesses who are no longer here. Some of \nthese witnesses live in other parts of the country and even, in some \ncases, other parts of the world.\n  There are meetings and meetings and meetings on these allegations. \nOne thing I love about the Senate Ethics Committee is the high level of \ntrust among the members in that committee. There is a culture of \nintegrity in that committee. As I said, even though it is no fun to sit \nin judgment of our colleagues, it has worked very well.\n  Because of the committee's policy of keeping its meetings closed and \nconfidential, it allows a freedom within the Ethics Committee to really \ndrill down and get into details and ask hard questions, questions that \nyou might be afraid to ask in a public forum because you may not know \nthe answer, and that answer may be very embarrassing and just by asking \nthe question, it could turn into an allegation.\n  The process we have right now--although it is closed, although it is \nconfidential--works very well. In a lot of ways it is similar to \nturning the case over to the jury, where you allow the jury to go back \ninto deliberations and hash it out however they want to do it. In the \nend, they come back and they do justice. I think our Founding Fathers \ngot it right in article I, section 5, paragraph 2 when they said that:\n\n       Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, \n     punish its Members for disorderly Behavior, and with the \n     Concurrence of two-thirds, expel a Member.\n\n  I think our Founding Fathers expected us to do this and not set up a \nthird party office to do this.\n  Again, I rise to join my two chairmen, the chairman and cochairman on \nthe Ethics Committee, in opposing this amendment, and I encourage all \nmy colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am voting against the Collins amendment \nbecause it is unconstitutional. Article I, section 5, provides:\n\n       Each House may determine the Rules of its' Proceedings, \n     punish its Members for disorderly behaviour, and, with the \n     concurrence of two-thirds, expel a Member.\n\n  The Senate has determined the rules for punishing its Members which \ncarries out the constitutional mandate. That constitutional procedure \ndoes not permit delegation of that responsibility.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n[[Page S2452]]\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I found this debate to be both \ninteresting and ironic. We have heard the proposed Office of Public \nIntegrity described on the one hand as being a potentially out-of-\ncontrol, independent counsel/special prosecutor. Then we have heard it \ndescribed as a toothless entity that simply duplicates the work of the \nEthics Committee and would have to check with the Ethics Committee at \nits every stage of the investigation.\n  In fact, neither characterization is an accurate one. Perhaps the \nbest way to think of the proposed Office of Public Integrity is that it \nwould be the investigative arm of the Ethics Committee. It would be an \nentity that would conduct a thorough, impartial, credible investigation \nof allegations and then report back to the Ethics Committee. It is \nessentially controlled by the Ethics Committee but has the ability to \ndo independent investigations.\n  It is neither an out-of-control special prosecutor nor is it a \npowerless office that simply duplicates the work being done and that \nwould be done by the Ethics Committee anyway. In fact, one of the \nopponents of this amendment said that they would create a duplicate \ninvestigation. I don't understand how that conclusion can be reached. \nThere is nothing in this amendment that would require the Ethics \nCommittee to conduct a parallel investigation, and why would they? We \nhave already heard the Chairman of the Ethics Committee say that they \ndo not do an investigation when there is a parallel Justice Department \ninvestigation going on. Why would the Ethics Committee choose to \nduplicate the work of the Office of Public Integrity? This bill does \nnot mandate that the Ethics Committee throw all common sense overboard. \nSo that argument simply does not hold water.\n  We have also heard it alleged that the Office of Public Integrity \nwould make public information that is now confidential. But look at the \nplain language of the amendment. I am going to read it into the Record \nbecause this information to the contrary has been advanced on the \nSenate floor. Here is what it says: ``Disclosure.'' It is on page 11 of \nthe amendment.\n\n       Information or testimony received, or the contents of a \n     complaint or the fact of its filing, or recommendations made \n     by the Director to the committee, may be publicly disclosed \n     by the Director or the staff of the Office only--\n\n  I am going to underscore that, Mr. President.\n\n     --only if authorized by the Select Committee on Ethics of the \n     Senate.\n\n  I don't know how it could be more clear, that the decision on \ndisclosing information on the investigation cannot be made unilaterally \nby the Office of Public Integrity. Under our amendment, the Ethics \nCommittee, not the Office of Public Integrity, has the sole authority \nto determine what parts of an investigation, if any, become a matter of \npublic record. The OPI has no such authority. The language could not be \nmore clear on that point.\n  Second, although a vote of the Ethics Committee to overrule the \nOffice of Public Integrity would be made public, that is because such a \nvote would end the case. In other words, the Ethics Committee would not \nbe voting publicly multiple times on a particular investigation at \nevery stage--contrary to the information, or the argument that was \nadvanced earlier by the distinguished chairman of the Ethics Committee. \nThis is how it would work. The Ethics Committee would vote only once, \neither to overrule the Office of Public Integrity, which it can do at \nany stage of the investigation, or at the end of the investigation the \ncommittee would vote on a final determination of whether a violation \nhas occurred.\n  I realize that Members have very strong views on this issue. I \nrealize there are legitimate differences of opinion. I recognize that \nthis is a difficult issue. But I hope that Members will look at the \nactual language of the amendment that Senator Lieberman, Senator \nMcCain, and I have advanced. I recognize that there is a reason there \nis considerable confusion. There are all different versions of entities \nsimilar to the Office of Public Integrity that we are proposing. But we \nhave drafted our proposal very carefully not to undermine the good work \nof the Ethics Committee, not to take away the final decisionmaking from \nthe Ethics Committee but to promote public confidence in the integrity \nand the credibility of investigations by having this office, the Office \nof Public Integrity, conduct the investigation.\n  Will the Presiding Officer inform me how much time is remaining on \nthe proponents' side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12 minutes remaining.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Ohio. I \ncongratulate the Senator from Maine for her extraordinary work on the \nunderlying lobby reform bill but respectfully disagree as to the \nappropriateness of adopting the Lieberman-Collins amendment.\n  This amendment creates a new Senate Office of Public Integrity with a \nDirector, appointed for a 5-year term, by the President Pro Tempore \nupon the joint recommendation of the majority leader and minority \nleader. He or she would literally be ``an investigation czar.'' Let me \njust highlight a few of the most problematic aspects of this proposal.\n  No. 1 on the list of the ``Duties'' of the Director is, and I quote \nfrom page 3, ``(1) to investigate . . .''. At its core the OPI is \nreally the ``SBI''--``Senate Bureau of Integrity''--not even of \nintelligence.\n  To get the ball rolling, investigations by the Director are initiated \nby a complaint filed by anyone--a complaint without any requirements. \nIn comparison, FEC complaints must be in ``in writing, signed and sworn \nto by the person filing such complaint, shall be notarized and shall be \nmade under penalty of perjury and subject to the provisions of the \ncriminal code.'' The complaint this integrity czar investigates doesn't \nhave to meet any of those requirements--it could be filed via anonymous \nvoicemail or on a beverage coaster--the name and address of the \ncomplainant isn't even required.\n  The only restriction on the complaint is that a complaint against a \nMember can't be ``accepted'' within 60 days of an election involving \nsuch Member. Thus, complaints can be filed against a Member's staff, \nand on the flip side, complaints made, maybe not accepted, but made \nduring that 60-day period against a Member gives that Member no way to \nclear their name until after that election.\n  Making matters even more grim, these complaints are only against \nincumbents or their staff--so challengers can go hog wild in filing \ncomplaints and keeping their opponents under a cloud of suspicion--no \nmatter how baseless. The only penalty for a frivolous complaint is they \nmight not accept another one from that person, to the extent their \nidentity is even known, and may incur costs resulting from the \ncomplaint. A very small price to pay for what would smear the good name \nof Members.\n  The Director is required to go to the Ethics Committee before getting \nhis full blown power to ``administer oaths, issue subpoenas, compel \nattendance and production of documents and take depositions.'' However, \nit takes a roll call vote of \\2/3\\ of the full committee to stop the \nDirector's full blown investigation and the vesting of his full \nprosecutorial powers.\n  This amendment strips the bipartisan 6-member Ethics Committee of one \nof its core functions--enforcement--arguably its most important--and \nvests it all in one unelected individual. I urge my colleagues to \noppose this amendment.\n  Let me say I know there are many watchers of the Senate, as an \ninstitution, who may well believe that the Ethics Committee is a body \nconstituted to go easy on Senators. I must respectfully suggest to the \npublic and to our colleagues that the facts are otherwise.\n  I was vice chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee and then \nsubsequently chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee during a time when \nmy\n\n[[Page S2453]]\n\nparty was in the majority in the Senate and had to, based on the facts \nin a particular case, offer a resolution to expel the chairman of the \nFinance Committee of the Senate from the Senate. That Member of the \nSenate subsequently resigned. But the vote in the Senate Ethics \nCommittee was 6 to 0, on a bipartisan basis, to expel the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee from the Senate. Surely, no one would consider \nthat a slap on the wrist.\n  I cite another example. When the current Senate Democratic leader was \nchairman of the Ethics Committee, it issued such a scathing report on a \nbipartisan basis that a Member of his party chose to discontinue his \neffort to be reelected in the fall of 2002. The Senate Ethics Committee \nrespects, first and foremost, this institution and its reputation. I \nthink it has undertaken extraordinary efforts over the years in \nprotecting Members from spurious complaints and being able to sort out \na genuine wrongdoing and, when genuine wrongdoing appears, go after it \nand not tolerate it.\n  I particularly compliment the current chairman of the Ethics \nCommittee, the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Voinovich, who has done an \nextraordinary job in this regard as well.\n  So I hope our colleagues, on a bipartisan basis, will not support the \nCollins-Lieberman amendment. I think the Senate Ethics Committee can \nhandle this job quite well in the future, as it has in the past.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, we are faced with a choice. We have the \nopportunity to pass significant legislation to strengthen our lobbying \ndisclosure laws to ban practices that raise questions about undue \ninfluence of special interests and to strengthen the enforcement of \nthose laws. Even without the Office of Public Integrity, I believe we \nhave produced a good bill. But I believe that our legislation will be \nincomplete if we do not act to strengthen the enforcement process. I \nbelieve, after much study, that the best way to do this is to create an \nOffice of Public Integrity.\n  That is not in any way to indicate a lack of appreciation for the \nhard work of the fine members of our Senate Ethics Committee under the \nleadership of two individuals with great integrity. I understand that \nit is a thankless job to serve on the Ethics Committee, and contrary to \nthe comment that was made earlier in the debate, I believe that this \noffice, by conducting the investigative portion, by assisting the \nEthics Committee in investigating allegations, would actually be of \ngreat assistance to the Ethics Committee.\n  The chairman of the Ethics Committee has expressed, time and again, \nhis frustration that the public does not know of the work the Ethics \nCommittee does. It doesn't realize how seriously the investigations and \nallegations are treated; that it doesn't appreciate how difficult it is \nto pursue allegations against Members with whom one serves. I suggest \nthat this amendment offers great assistance to the Ethics Committee. If \nthere is an Office of Public Integrity which is conducting independent \ninvestigations and reporting its findings to the Ethics Committee, I \nthink that enhances the public's understanding of the process, the \npublic's acceptance of the process, and the credibility of the \ninvestigations.\n  We are dealing with a reality that public confidence in Congress is \nvery low. It is perilously low. It makes it difficult for us to pass \nlegislation because the public believes that oftentimes our decisions \nare not in the public interest but, rather, beholden to some private \ninterest. That saddens me because I know the people I serve with are \nindividuals of great integrity, and the vast majority of elected \nofficials in Washington and elsewhere are in public service for all the \nright reasons. But that perception is a reality we need to deal with. \nThe best way to deal with it, in my judgment, is to pass strong, \ncomprehensive legislation which will help repair the frayed bonds \nbetween the public and those who serve the public.\n  The Office of Public Integrity is an integral part of achieving that \ngoal. There is a lot of opposition to this amendment. I don't delude \nmyself to the contrary. I have learned organizational change in \nWashington is the hardest kind of change to accomplish. I learned that \nwhen Senator Lieberman and I led the legislation restructuring and \nreforming our intelligence community, the most sweeping reforms in 50 \nyears. I have learned trying to change the organization of Congress or \nthe way Congress works makes that reorganization of our intelligence \ncommunity look easy.\n  I recognize this is an uphill fight, but I believe it is the right \nthing to do. I hope our colleagues, before casting their vote today, \nwill take the time to read the actual language of the amendment and to \nthink about what we need to do to repair the breach between those who \nare elected and the people we serve, to promote and strengthen public \nconfidence in the political process. I believe if our colleagues do \nthat and if they care about restoring public confidence in Congress, \nthey will support the amendment we have offered.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, first, I again compliment the chairman \nof the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee for the \ngood job she and the committee have done in proposing legislation that \nwill make a difference in the Senate and in the Congress. I respect \neverything the Senator has done. Some of the amendments making \nmandatory some of the things we are doing voluntarily I welcome. I \nthank the Senator.\n  One thing I have tried to do is to inform Members about what the \nrules are so they do not get in trouble. I point out that even though \nthe amendment is well motivated and meant to help the Ethics Committee, \nall six members of the Ethics Committee on a bipartisan basis oppose \nit. The Ethics Committee is the investigative arm of the Senate. It is \na nonpartisan investigator of all matters brought before the Ethics \nCommittee and, something some Members are not happy about, matters that \nare not brought before us, on the complaint of some, that we recognize, \nthrough the media, there is a problem with one of the Members, and we \nget involved in it. We do not have to wait for someone to file a \ncomplaint. We are the watchdog of the Senate. We want to protect the \nSenate's reputation. We admonish, we censor and, in some cases, eject \nMembers of this Senate for not upholding the high standards all Members \nare expected to uphold after being elected to this Senate.\n  I do not believe this is going to mend the problem in terms of public \nconfidence. As I have mentioned, except for recently some criticisms, \nwe did not get involved in the Abramoff investigation. Overall, in \nterms of the public, the Senate Ethics Committee has been doing the job \nthey are supposed to do under the Constitution. Again, I underscore in \nterms of Abramoff, we did not get involved because of the fact that the \nJustice Department asked us not to get involved. They thought it would \ninterfere with their investigation. I assure Members of the Senate and \nI assure the public and other groups that are looking in on us, once \nthat investigation is finished and the information is sent here, if one \nof our Members or several Members are involved, we will fully \ninvestigate that. If those individuals have violated the rules of the \nSenate, they will be properly dealt with by the Ethics Committee.\n  In terms of the specific parts of this legislation, I bring up \nsomething that has a problem, and that is that every time the Ethics \nCommittee disagrees with the Office of Public Integrity, we have to \nhave a published vote of the committee. As a result of that, what will \nhappen, in my opinion, is that after a while, where the Ethics \nCommittee does not agree with the Office of Public Integrity, you will \nbuild up an adversarial type of relationship. Members, in terms of how \nthey vote, will start taking into consideration, gee, it is going to be \npublic that we disagreed with this guy and people will ask, why did you \ndisagree with that, and we get into that whole area of questioning \npeople's motivation.\n  It also gets us involved in partisanship, Members asking, why did you \nvote that particular way? You had a chance maybe to harm some other \nMember because of political reasons. Or why did you pick on one of our \nMembers?\n  This job is a very tough job. It is not a job that makes one popular \nwith his\n\n[[Page S2454]]\n\ncolleagues in this Senate. I believe rather than helping the situation, \nin spite of the fine motivation of the people sponsoring this \namendment, rather than helping, it is going to hurt the situation and \nalso make it very difficult in the future to have Members being willing \nto serve as a member of the Senate Ethics Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have been allocated 10 minutes to \nspeak on the Wyden amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I seek to use that time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield for an inquiry?\n  Is there a unanimous consent in terms of Members speaking?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, the time is controlled by the Senator \nfrom Alabama and the Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, to clarify our situation, if I may, if \nthe Presiding Officer would tell me if I am correct that there is still \nan amount of time remaining to the proponents of the Collins-Lieberman-\nMcCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 6 minutes remaining.\n  Ms. COLLINS. And I believe the time of the opponents has expired, the \ntime that was controlled by Senator Voinovich; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Ms. COLLINS. And I believe there is a parallel time agreement for \nfurther debate on the Wyden amendment; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. INHOFE. My request would be that I be acknowledged to speak on \nthe Wyden-Grassley-Inhofe amendment in whatever order you are prepared \nto give me.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am going to reserve my 6 minutes for \nright before the vote for some concluding comments. I probably will not \nuse all 6 minutes. I have no objection to turning now to the debate on \nthe Wyden amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2944\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I assume Senator Inhofe will have time after I conclude \nmy 10 minutes and I ask unanimous consent to that effect. He is on the \nother side of this issue.\n  The Wyden amendment provides a new advantage for those who want \nbigger and more expensive Government. Senators who want time to study a \nbill before granting consent would have to put their names in the \nRecord as objecting to it even though they may quickly decide they do \nnot have an objection to the bill.\n  First, the Senator from Oregon stated that this amendment--and this \nis a good example of what happens in the Senate--that this amendment \nwas being blocked by a secret hold. But there was no secret hold. The \nleadership of the Senate knew that I had an interest in participating \nin the debate, but I had a meeting at the White House this morning and \nso I asked if they could accommodate that and set the debate at a time \nI could participate. That apparently was worked out.\n  Under the Senator from Oregon's amendment, I would have had to submit \na written request to the majority leader in order to participate in the \ndebate, but I was at the White House and that was not very practical. \nIs telling my leader I would like an opportunity to be in the Senate to \ndebate this issue now an unreasonable request? The Senator from Oregon \nhas also stated that the intelligence authorization bill is being held \nup based on a secret hold. In truth, it is not a secret. I will tell \nthe Senator who is holding that important intelligence bill: It is the \ntwo Senators from Massachusetts. Senators Kennedy and Kerry have \nobjected to considering the bill because they want to offer amendments. \nSome say they are poison-pill amendments, but they are amendments they \nwant to offer. So if the Senator has a problem about that, he should \ntalk to his colleagues. The Senators may say this only applies to \nproceeding to a bill. This is an important thing, because in 99 percent \nof the cases, proceedings of the bill and passage of the bill happen at \nthe same time. The bill is called up and asked to be passed by \nunanimous consent. It is all the same request. Frankly, the problem \nwith this bill goes further than the mechanical application. It makes a \nstatement. It basically says that passing bills is inherently a good \nthing, and we should assume any Senator who has never heard of a bill \nshould consent to it. Anyone who dares not to grant promptly and \nimmediately any such consent is some scoundrel who needs to be exposed \nto misdeeds.\n  Senator Coburn has offered an amendment that says if we are going to \nhave this hold amendment, he would offer one that says if you want to \npass a bill and there is no quorum present, and you want to ram it \nthrough with no quorum present, you need to have a petition signed by \n100 Senators saying they are prepared to let the bill go through.\n  Why not? It is not practical, perhaps, but the system is not designed \nto be practical. Frankly, it is too easy to pass bills. Bills flow \nthrough this body like water.\n  I want the American people to know how bills are passed in this \nSenate. We were talking about some sunshine here. Let's talk about it. \nThere is a system we have called a hotline. What is a hotline? In each \nSenate office there are three telephones with hotline buttons on them. \nMost evenings, sometimes after business hours, these phones begin to \nring. The calls are from the Republican and the Democratic leaders to \neach of their Members, asking consent to pass this or that bill--not \nconsider the bill or have debate on the bill but to pass it. Those \ncalls will normally give a deadline. If the staff do not call back in \n30 minutes, the bill passes. Boom. It can be 500 pages. In many \noffices, when staffers do not know anything about the bill, they \nusually ignore the hotline and let the bill pass without even informing \ntheir Senators. If the staff miss the hotline, or do not know about it \nor were not around, the Senator is deemed to have consented to the \npassage of some bill which might be quite an important piece of \ninformation.\n  So that is the real issue here. The issue is not about holds. The \nrules say nothing about holds. Holds do not exist. The issue is \nconsent. Nobody has a right to have an individual Senator's consent to \npass a bill. They act as though you have a right to get it. You would \nexpect if you are going to say you have unanimous consent, you have \nconsent. But that is not always the case.\n  If staff do not have time to read the bill--some of these bills are \nhundreds of pages long--they frequently assume someone else has read \nit. Staff in the Senate offices do not read all these bills, and they \ngo back to whatever they were doing before the hotline phone rang. \nPresumably, some committee staffer has read the bill at some point \nalong the way, but in almost no case have actual Members of the Senate \ngranted their intentional consent to the bills that pass during the \nday's wrapup that we often see late into the night on C-SPAN.\n  In many cases, even Senators sponsoring the bill have never read it, \nunfortunately. Committee reports are filed on bills. Very few staff \nhave read the committee reports. How do I know about this? I have the \nthankless task of chairing the Senate Steering Committee. One of our \ncommitments is to review every bill that is hotlined in the Senate. My \nstaff actually reads them. It is a service to my colleagues, I suggest. \nThey read the CBO scores which tell how much the bill costs the \ntaxpayers. A lot of times they do not want you to know that. Some \ncommittee, group, or someone has moved a bill on the floor--they move \nit along--and nobody has read the score. Many contain massive, new \nspending programs. Some bust the budget. We think Senators who are \nlooking out for the taxpayers and taking the time to study bills should \nhave the same rights as Senators who are willing to let big spending \nbills pass without reading them. This amendment is not good government. \nIt will make it more likely that bills will pass in the middle of the \nnight filled with pork and who knows what else.\n  The current process established by the two leaders provides for 72 \nhours for Senators to withhold consent and to read a bill. Beyond that, \nthe objections become public. Under this amendment, if a Senator in an \noffhand conversation with the leader says, ``I\n\n[[Page S2455]]\n\nthink we ought to take a hard look at this bill,'' does that mean his \nname should be printed in the Record? That is not workable. If I am on \nthe floor, and the leader asks me if we ought to go to such and such a \nbill, and I say, ``No, don't do that, I think something else should go \nfirst,'' do I then immediately have to go to the floor and publish that \nin the Record?\n  According to this resolution, any communication with the leader \nsuggesting we not proceed to a bill would need to be printed in the \nRecord and submitted to the leader in writing. However, if I \ncommunicate to the leader that we should proceed to some big spending \nbill, I can do that in secret. This gives a new advantage to those who \nwant to pass legislation without review.\n  Now, I take very seriously holding up a bill. We stay on our team, \nand we look at the matter promptly and try to give an honest response. \nAnd if we have a problem with a clause or two in a piece of \nlegislation, we share that with the Senators who are promoting the \nlegislation. Usually an agreement can be reached, and usually the \nlegislation is cleared, anyway, without any significant delay.\n  Line 4 of the Wyden amendment says:\n\n       The majority and minority leaders of the Senate or their \n     designees shall recognize a notice of intent of a Senator who \n     is a member of their caucus to object to proceeding to a \n     measure or matter only if the Senator\n       (1) submits the notice of intent in writing to the \n     appropriate leader or their designee; and\n       (2) within 3 session days after the submission under \n     paragraph (1) submits for inclusion in the Congressional \n     Record and in the applicable calendar section described in \n     subsection (b) the following notice:\n       ``I, Senator [blank], intend to object to proceeding to \n     [blank], dated [blank].''\n\n  If a Senator tells their leader on the phone they have concern with a \nbill that was offered that night, must they quickly run down to his \noffice and hand the leader a piece of paper? This says it must be \nsubmitted in writing; otherwise, the leader cannot recognize it.\n  If the leader decides against proceeding to the bill, does that mean \nhe has violated the rule?\n  How can we prove that the leader did not simply change his mind, but \nrather that he illegally recognized an oral hold, which was not \nsubmitted in writing?\n  Who is to make such a determination?\n  Is the Parliamentarian going to be put in the uncomfortable position \nof trying to divine the motivations of a party leader?\n  I am not sure what the purpose of the 3 days is, but here is what its \neffect is:\n  If a bill is hotlined at 7:30 at night, and the leaders say it will \nbe passed at 7:45 unless there is an objection, and my staff calls them \nto say please do not proceed, we would like to review the bill, rather \nthan reading the bill, they would have to run to the leader's office \nwith a piece of paper saying we object to the bill.\n  Then, let's say they run back to the office, start reading, and after \nreview, the bill looks fine. Let's say they even call back within the \n15-minute window that was given. The bill passes that night. The next \nday it passes the House, and is signed by the President. It is now law.\n  On the third day, I would still need to insert a statement in the \nCongressional Record saying ``I, Senator Jeff Sessions, intend to \nobject to proceeding [blank], dated [blank].''\n  I intend to object to a bill that has already been signed into law?\n  The amendment has been so poorly drafted that it is not even clear \nwhat it does. This is what we are dealing with.\n  This poorly drafted amendment is intended to stack the deck, in favor \nof other poorly drafted legislation passing in the middle of the night \nwith little or no review.\n  Let's look at section (c) line 18:\n\n       A Senator may have an item with respect to the Senator \n     removed from a calendar to which it was added under \n     subsection (b) by submitting for inclusion in the \n     Congressional Record the following notice:\n       I, Senator [blank], do not object to proceeding to [blank], \n     dated [blank].\n\n  This is the flip side: Maybe you looked at the bill and do not like \nit, but are willing to let it pass by a voice vote.\n  Now, to get the ``scarlet letter'' I removed, you need to put a \nstatement into the Record saying you do not object to the bill, which \nmay not be altogether true.\n  Further, what if you simply want to offer an amendment, or debate, \nbut the leadership wants to pass the bill clean. How does this bill \napply?\n  I suppose one interpretation is it would not apply at all, because it \nonly purports to apply to ``proceeding to a bill.''\n  What if you want to offer a thousand amendments? What then? What if \nyou prefer to proceed to a different version of the bill?\n  What if you would simply like a rollcall vote on the motion to \nproceed, or would like time to debate, but the leadership does not want \nto grant you that. Technically, you are objecting to proceeding under \nthose circumstances.\n  I could stand here for hours discussing all the many ways this \namendment is going to damage the Senate, and the many ways this \namendment is absolutely worthless as a tool to prevent blocking of \nlegislation in secret.\n  But what I object to most is that this amendment says passing \nlegislation is always preferable to slowing it down, that letting a \nbill pass is good no matter how poorly drafted, how costly, how late in \nthe evening, or how few Senators have studied or even heard of the \nbill.\n  How much pork is there? Passing bills is good: In many cases, that is \nnot correct.\n  There is a widely quoted story about the ``coolness'' of the Senate \ninvolving George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson was in \nFrance during the Constitutional Convention.\n  Upon his return, Jefferson visited Washington and asked why the \nConvention delegates had created a Senate. ``Why did you pour that \ncoffee into your saucer?'' asked Washington. ``To cool it, `` said \nJefferson. ``Even so,'' responded Washington, ``we pour legislation \ninto the senatorial saucer to cool it.''\n  The Framers intended the Senate to deliberate, to thoughtfully review \nlegislation, not be a rubber stamp.\n  This amendment says those Senators who are willing to grant consent \nto legislation they have never read or have perhaps never even heard \nof--those are the good Senators.\n  But those Senators who dare to say: I would like time to read this \nlegislation, to see how much it costs, to see whether it is within the \nnational interests--they are the troublemakers. These scoundrels need \nto be exposed to the public.\n  So, in summary, here is where we are.\n  Passing midnight spending boondoggles with two Senators in the \nChamber: Good. Reviewing legislation: Bad. Objecting to big spending \nlegislation: Really bad.\n  Lobbyists must be thrilled with this. Lobbyists who are pushing \nspecial-interest legislation will now have a ready-made target list.\n  All they need to do is get the leadership to hotline the legislation, \nand within 3 days they will know who they need to talk to or jump on or \n``sick the dogs on.''\n  I believe we need to return to the ``cooling'' Senate, not a \n``freezing'' Senate, where obstruction is the rule, nominees are \nblocked endlessly; not a ``greased'' Senate, where bad legislation \npasses at lightning speed late at night with no time for review, but a \nSenate where Senators are encouraged to take the time to pick up a bill \nand read it, to weigh the consequences for the American taxpayers.\n  This amendment runs directly contrary to the spirit of reform this \nbill purports to address.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I see several of the sponsors of the \namendment here. Probably they disagree with some of my views, but I \nthink they are worthy of their consideration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: How much time is \navailable on my side? My understanding is we have 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon controls 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, it is my desire to yield the first 3 \nminutes to Senator Inhofe, the next 3 minutes to Senator Grassley, and \nthen I will\n\n[[Page S2456]]\n\nspeak. I thank my friend from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first, let me say to my friend from \nAlabama, I do not think we have ever been in disagreement on anything. \nI have a little different take on this issue than he does and a little \ndifferent background because of an experience I had when I served in \nthe other body.\n  First, I think realistically, looking at this, you may say ``in \nwriting,'' but if you call your leader and tell him, ``I plan to go \nahead and object to this,'' and he knows it is going to come in \nwriting, unless you don't get along with the leader very well, I don't \nthink that would be a real serious problem. But I do agree with the \nSenator from Alabama that passing laws is not necessarily a good thing. \nMy feeling is we have too many laws, not too few laws. I have said that \nmany times.\n  But let me share with you an experience I had in the other body. When \nI was first elected in 1986 to the House of Representatives, I found \nthere was a process used to keep the signatures of a discharge petition \nfrom being open to the public. So there could be something very \npopular. For example, a gun control bill might not be popular in West \nTexas, but there might be a West Texas Democrat whose party tells him \nfor the national scene, ``We want lots of gun controls, and I know it \nis not popular in the State, but there is a way you can go home and say \nyou opposed gun controls and at the same time you can get by with \nappeasing the leadership.''\n  That is what they did. They would put the discharge petition in the \ndrawer of the Speaker's desk, and you could not get it out unless a \nmajority of people signed the discharge petition. Consequently, they \nwould go ahead and tell people they had signed it when, in fact, they \nhad not.\n  I had a one-sentence bill that totally reformed that. It stated that \nall signatures on a discharge petition shall become public record. We \nactually had seven editorials by the Wall Street Journal. We had all \nthese things saying: Finally, there is light.\n  All I want--all I want--is to be able to have everyone being \naccountable for what they are saying. I have two holds right now, and I \nhave said publicly that I am the one who has the holds. I have never, \nin the 12 years I have been here in this body, not specifically stated \nthat I had holds when I did. So I think that is the main thing. There \nare similarities between the situation that occurred in the House, and \nI agree with Reader's Digest, the Wall Street Journal. They said that \nwas the greatest single reform in the last 60 years.\n  So when I first came to this body, I made this statement: that it \nappeared to me that being able to put on holds without being \naccountable is a very similar practice to the inability of knowing what \nthe signatures were on discharge petitions. Consequently, I started \nback 12 years ago working on this issue. I am very happy to join \nSenator Wyden and Senator Grassley in what I consider to be a reform \nthat is badly needed in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a November 1994 article \nin Reader's Digest by Daniel Levine be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Reader's Digest, November 1994]\n\n                How the Trial Lawyers Finally Met Defeat\n\n\n                 A story of democracy and Capitol Hill\n\n                         (By Daniel R. Levine)\n\n       When a twin-engine Cessna airplane crashed near Fallon, \n     Nev., four years ago, the National Transportation Safety \n     Board (NTSB) ruled pilot error was the cause. But that didn't \n     stop lawyers for two of the injured passengers from suing \n     Cessna on the grounds that the seats on the 25-year-old plane \n     did not provide adequate support. The seats had been ripped \n     out without Cessna's knowledge and rearranged to face each \n     other. But the lawyers claimed that Cessna should have warned \n     against removing the seats. A jury awarded the two plaintiffs \n     more than $2 million.\n       In Compton, Calf., a single-engine airplane nearly stalled \n     on the runway and sputtered loudly during take-off. Less than \n     a minute into the air it crashed, killing two of the three \n     people on board. On July 18, 1989, two days before the one-\n     year statute of limitations would expire, the survivor and \n     relatives of the deceased passengers filed a $2.5 million \n     lawsuit naming the plane's manufacturer, Piper Aircraft \n     Corp., as a defendant. Not mentioned in the suit was the fact \n     that the plane, built in 1956, had been sitting at the \n     airport unused and uninspected for 2\\1/2\\ years. The case, \n     awaiting trial, has already cost Piper $50,000.\n       The NTSB found that 203 crashes of Beech aircraft between \n     1989 and 1992 were caused by weather, faulty maintenance, \n     pilot error or air control mishaps. But trial lawyers blamed \n     the manufacturer and sued each time. Beech was forced to \n     spend an average of $530,000 defending itself in each case \n     and up to $200,000 simply preparing for those that were \n     dismissed.\n       Such product-liability lawsuits have forced small-plane \n     makers such as Cessna to carry $25 million a year in \n     liability insurance. In fact, Cessna stopped producing \n     piston-powered planes primarily because of high cost of \n     defending liability lawsuits. Thus, an American industry that \n     15 years ago ruled the world's skies has lost more than \n     100,000 jobs and has seen the number of small planes it \n     manufactured plummet from over 17,000 in 1978 to under 600 \n     last year.\n       That may all change. Bucking years of intense lobbying by \n     trial lawyers, Congress voted last summer to bar lawsuits \n     against small-plane manufacturers after a plane and its parts \n     have been in service 18 years. The legislation will create an \n     estimated 25,000 aviation jobs within five years as \n     manufacturers retool and increase production.\n       This was the first time that Congress has reformed a \n     product liability law against the wishes of the lawyers who \n     make millions from these cases. And the dramatic victory was \n     made possible because of the efforts of a little-known \n     Congressman from Oklahoma who challenged Capitol Hill's \n     establishment.\n       On his first day in 1987 as a member of the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, Jim Inhofe (R., Okla.) asked colleague Mike \n     Synar (D., Okla.) how he had compiled such a liberal voting \n     record while winning reelection in a conservative district. \n     Overhearing the question, another longtime Democratic \n     Congressman interjected: ``It's easy. Vote liberal, press-\n     release conservative.''\n       This was a revealing lesson in Congressional ethics, the \n     first of many that would open Inhofe's eyes to the way \n     Congress really ran. He soon realized that an archaic set of \n     rules enabled members to deceive constituents and avoid \n     accountability.\n       When a Congressman introduced a bill, the Speaker of the \n     House refers it to the appropriate committee. Once there, \n     however, the bill is at the mercy of the committee chairman, \n     who represents the views of the Congressional leadership. If \n     he supports the legislation, he can speed it through hearings \n     to the House floor for a vote. Or he can simply ``bury'' it \n     beneath another committee business.\n       This arrangement is tailor-made for special-interest \n     lobbies like the Association of Trial Lawyers of America \n     (ATLA). For eight years, bills to limit the legal liability \n     of small-aircraft manufacturers had been referred to the \n     House Judiciary Committee, only to be buried. Little wonder. \n     One of the ATLA's most reliable supporters on Capital Hill \n     has been Rep. Jack Brooks (D., Texas), powerful chairman of \n     that committee and recipient of regular campaign \n     contributions from ATLA.\n       The only way for Congressmen to free bills that chairmen \n     such as Brooks wanted to kill was a procedure called the \n     discharge petition. Under it, a Congressman could dislodge a \n     buried bill if a House majority, 218 members, signed a \n     petition bringing it directly to the floor for a vote. But \n     discharge petitions virtually never succeeded because, since \n     1931, signatures were kept secret from public. This allowed \n     Congressmen to posture publicly in favor of an issue, then \n     thwart passage of the bill by refusing to sign the discharge \n     petition. At the same time, House leaders could view the \n     petitions, enabling them to pressure signers to remove their \n     names. Of 493 discharge petitions ever filed, only 45 got the \n     numbers of signatures required for a House vote. And only two \n     of those bills became law.\n       Inhofe saw the proposals overwhelmingly favored by the \n     American People--the 1990 balanced-budget amendment, school \n     prayer, Congressional term limits, the line-item veto--were \n     bottled up in committee by the House leadership. When \n     discharge petitions to free some of the bills were initiated, \n     they were locked in a drawer in the Clerk's desk on the House \n     floor. The official rules warned that disclosing names ``is \n     strictly prohibited under the precedents of the House.''\n       In March 1993, Inhofe filed a one-sentence bill on the \n     House floor challenging the secrecy: ``Once a motion to \n     discharge has been filed the Clerk shall make the signatures \n     a matter of public record.''\n       The bill was assigned to the Rules Committee, where it was \n     buried. Three months later, on May 27, Inhofe started a \n     discharge petition to bring the bill to a floor vote. Among \n     those signing was Tim Penny (D., Minn.), a lawmaker who after \n     ten years in the House had grown so disgusted that he had \n     decided not to run for re-election. ``Discharge petitions \n     procedures are symbolic of the manipulative and secretive way \n     decisions are made here,'' said Penny. ``It's just one more \n     example of how House leaders rig the rules to make sure they \n     aren't challenged on the floor.''\n       Inhofe, though, was badly outnumbered. The Democrats 82-\n     seat majority controlled the flow of legislation. But he was \n     not cowed. From his first years in politics Inhofe had shown \n     an independent streak--and it had paid off. After initially \n     losing elections for governor and Congress. He was elected to \n     three consecutive terms as mayor of Tulsa,\n\n[[Page S2457]]\n\n     beginning in 1977. In 1986, he ran again for the Congress and \n     won. Four years later, he bucked his own President, George \n     Bush, by voting against a 1991 budget ``compromise'' that \n     included a $156-billion tax hike.\n       By August 4, two months after filing his discharge \n     petition, Inhofe had 200 signatures, just 18 shy of the 218 \n     needed to force his bill to the floor. But the House \n     leadership was using all its muscle to thwart him. On the \n     House floor, Inhofe announced: ``I am disclosing to The Wall \n     Street Journal the names of all members who have not signed \n     the discharge petition. People deserve to know what is going \n     on in this place.''\n       It was a risk. House leaders could make him pay for this \n     deed. But by making public the names of non-signers, he would \n     avoid a direct violation of House rules. Inhofe collected the \n     names by asking every member who signed the petition to \n     memorize as many other signatures as possible.\n       The next day, The Wall Street Journal ran the first of six \n     editorials on the subject. Titled ``Congress's Secret \n     Drawer,'' it accused Congressional leaders of using \n     discharge-petition secrecy to ``protect each other and keep \n     constituents in the dark.''\n       On the morning of August 6, Inhofe was within a handful of \n     the 218 signatures. As the day wore on, more members came \n     forward to sign. With two hours to go before the August \n     recess, the magic number of 218 was within his grasp.\n       What happened next stunned Inhofe. Two of the most powerful \n     members of Congress--Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman \n     John Dingell (D., Mich.) and Rules Committee Chairman Joseph \n     Moakley (D., Mass.)--moved next to him at the discharge \n     petition desk. In a display one witness described as \n     political ``trench warfare,'' the two began ``convincing'' \n     members to remove their names from the petition.\n       Standing near the desk was Rep. James Moran (D., Va.). \n     Moakley warned him that if Inhofe succeeded, members would be \n     forced to vote on controversial bills. ``Jim,'' he said \n     sternly, ``I don't have to tell you how dangerous that would \n     be.'' When the dust settled, Moran and five colleagues--\n     Robert Borski (D., Pa.), Bill Brewster (D., Okla.), Bob \n     Clement (D., Tenn.), Glenn English (D., Okla.) and Tony Hall \n     (D., Ohio)--had erased their names.\n       Still refusing to quit, Inhofe faxed the first Wall Street \n     Journal editorial to hundreds of radio stations. Before long, \n     he found himself on call-in programs virtually every day of \n     the week.\n       When The Wall Street Journal printed the names of the \n     nonsigners on August 17, House members home for the summer \n     recess could not avoid the public outcry Inhofe had \n     generated. With scandals in the House bank, post office and \n     restaurant still fresh in their minds, voters were \n     demanding openness.\n       Feeling outgunned, Moakley allowed his Democratic \n     colleagues to sign the discharge petition. When Rep. Marjorie \n     Margolies-Mezvinsky (D., Pa.) affixed her name to the \n     petition on September 8, she became the 218th Signatory.\n       Inhofe's bill won overwhelming approval on the final vote, \n     384-40. Even though most Democrats had not supported him, 209 \n     now voted with Inhofe. Groused Dingell: ``I think the whole \n     thing stinks.''\n       The first real test of Inhofe's change came last May when \n     Representatives Dan Glickman (D., Kan.) and James Hansen (R., \n     Utah) filed a discharge petition to free their bill limiting \n     small-plane manufacturer liability. Even though it was co-\n     sponsored by 305 members, the bill had been bottled up in the \n     Judiciary Committee for nine months. But because members' \n     signatures would now be public, voters would finally know who \n     truly stood for product-liability reform and who did not.\n       Meanwhile, the Association of Trial Lawyers of America was \n     pulling out all the stops to kill the bill. Members \n     personally lobbied Congressmen and orchestrated a ``grass-\n     roots'' letter-writing campaign in which prominent trial \n     attorneys urged their Representatives not to support the \n     bill. ATLA even fired off a maximum-allowable contribution of \n     $5,000 to Representative Hansen's opponent in the November \n     election.\n       The pressure didn't work. Within two weeks 185 members had \n     signed, and House leaders realized it would be impossible to \n     stop the petition. Their only way was to offer a compromise \n     version. In mid-June, Brooks reported out of committee a bill \n     that differed only slightly from the original. On August 2, \n     the Senate approved similar legislation. The next day the \n     bill cleared the House without dissent. On August 17, \n     President Clinton signed it into law.\n       Glickman, whose Wichita district is home to Cessna and \n     Beech aircraft companies, said the procedural change \n     spearheaded by Inhofe was crucial to victory. ``A lot of \n     forces did not want this bill to go forward,'' he continued, \n     ``and it would not have succeeded without the discharge \n     petition.''\n       The success of this legislation is proof that when Congress \n     is required to do the people's business in the open, the \n     people--rather than special interests--win. The high cost of \n     product-liability lawsuits, to manufacturers as well as \n     consumers, will require far more sweeping reform of the tort \n     system. But the passage of this one bill is an important \n     first step in the right direction. And it took a little-known \n     Representative from Oklahoma to point the way.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, thank you. And I thank Senator Wyden for \nhis leadership and the time.\n  Everything this body has heard the Senator from Alabama say about \nwhat is wrong with this piece of legislation is entirely inaccurate. \nEverything he said we need to do to study bills--to hold them up until \nwe get a feel about everything in a bill before enactment by this \nbody--this amendment, which brings transparency to holds, does not in \nany way prevent any of that from happening. All it simply says is, if \nyou are going to put a hold on legislation, you ought to have guts \nenough, not be a sissy that the public might find out who you are, why \nyou are holding something up. State for the entire country why you \nthink this person or this bill ought to be held up in the Senate. You \ncan hold it up for a year. You can hold it up for 1 day.\n  I have been putting things in the Record of why I put holds on bills, \njust as this amendment requires, for several years. And I can assure \nyou, not one of my colleagues has beaten me up because they knew who I \nwas. Not one of my colleagues has bloodied my nose. Not one of my \ncolleagues has given me a black eye. Not one of my colleagues has done \nanything. It does not hurt. You can be a Senator. You can be out in the \nopen. You can be transparent and still do the job you need to do.\n  But after all, this is the Senate. The public's business ought to be \npublic. That is what this legislation is all about. But it also has \nsomething to do with the practical workings of the Senate. If somebody \ndoes not like a bill you propose, and they want to slow it up, you can \nsit down and talk to them. Now you do not even know who they are, in \nmany instances. If you are going to do business, you have to know who \nto talk to. Being a part of a collegial body, as we are, talking to \neach other is how you get things done and move the ball along.\n  It is about open government. It is about reducing cynicism and \ndistrust of public officials. It is about public accountability. It is \nabout building public confidence. It is about making sure that as to \nwhat is being done here, the public knows who is doing it and why they \nare doing it. I do not see why there can be any opposition to this \namendment.\n  A hold is a very powerful tool and must be used with transparency. I \nbelieve in the principle of open government. Lack of transparency in \nthe public policy process leads to cynicism and distrust of public \nofficials.\n  There is no good reason why a Senator should be able to \nsinglehandedly block the Senate's business without any public \naccountability. The use of secret holds damages public confidence in \nthe institution of the Senate.\n  Our amendment would establish a standing order of the Senate \nrequiring Members to publicly disclose when they place a hold on a bill \nor nominee. For several years now, I have made it my practice to insert \na notice in the Congressional Record whenever I place a hold.\n  Under our proposal, disclosing holds will be as simple as filling out \na cosponsor sheet and Senators will have 3 days to do it.\n  This proposal was drafted with the help of Senators Lott and Byrd, \nwho as former majority leaders know how this body operates and how \ndisruptive secret holds can be to the Senate's business. Senator \nStevens has expressed his concerns about the use of secret holds. It \nsays a lot that the longest-serving Members of this body oppose the use \nof secret holds and see them as a real problem.\n  If Senators support the goal of the underlying bill to increase \nlegislative transparency and accountability, then they should support \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I yield to Senator Lott.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, very briefly, I rise in support of this \namendment. I think the misuse of the hold in the Senate has become a \nfundamental problem. I do not see how anybody could support the concept \nof secret holds.\n  Now, this may drive holds into some other category, but I think it is \na step\n\n[[Page S2458]]\n\nin the right direction. I commend Senator Wyden and Senator Grassley \nfor offering it.\n  This proposal is an experiment in making the Senate and Senators more \naccountable to their colleagues and to the American people. This \nproposal addresses the issue of anonymous holds that Senators use to \nprevent consideration of legislation and nominations. This amendment \nwould place a greater responsibility on Senators to make their holds \npublic.\n  It requires that the majority and minority leaders can only recognize \na hold that is provided in writing. Moreover, for the hold to be \nhonored, the Senator objecting would have to publish his objection in \nthe Congressional Record, 3 days after the notice is provided to a \nleader.\n  I believe that holds, whether anonymous or publicly announced, are an \naffront to the Senate, the leadership, the committees, and to the \nindividual Members of this institution.\n  This amendment does not eliminate the right of a Senator to place a \nhold. Some day, the Senate may decide that holds, in and of themselves, \nare an undemocratic practice that should no longer be recognized.\n  Secret holds have no place in a publicly accountable institution. A \nmeasure that is important to a majority of the American public and a \nmajority of Senators should not be stopped dead in it's tracks by a \nsingle Senator. And when that Senator can hide behind the anonymous \nhold, democracy itself is damaged.\n  How do you tell your constituents that legislation they have an \ninterest in, legislation that has been approved by the majority of a \ncommittee, is stalled and you don't know who is holding it up? What \ndoes that say about this institution?\n  I think the secret hold should have no place in this institution, and \nI urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I understand this amendment requires public \ndisclosure of certain holds--namely, those that rise to the level of \nexpressing an intent to object to proceeding to a measure or matter.\n  Any such objection would have to be submitted in writing and \ndisclosed in the Congressional Record and printed in the Senate \ncalendar of business. Quite frankly, if a Member's objection rises to \nthat level, it is probably appropriate to publicly disclose such.\n  But the term ``hold'' is used to apply to a much broader form of \ncommunication between Members and the leader. A hold is generally \nconsidered to be any communication in which a Member expresses an \ninterest in specific legislation and requests that the Member be \nconsulted or advised before any agreement is entered with regard to the \nissue.\n  In that sense, a hold is a Senate mode of communication, rather than \na procedural prerogative, and when used to communicate a Member's \ninterest in a matter, it is more of an informal bargaining tactic, not \nan intent to derail or delay consideration of a measure.\n  Such informal communication is not only important to the workings of \nthis body, but it facilitates the development of unanimous consent \nrequests and facilitates the consideration of legislation.\n  In some respects, such informal holds act much like the Rules \nCommittee proceedings in the House whereby Members present their \nposition with regard to offering amendments to legislation.\n  There is no such process in the Senate and often times informal \nholds, or consent letters, are the only means by which the leadership \nknows who has an interest in an issue and needs to be consulted in \norder to craft a unanimous consent agreement.\n  This amendment does not affect such informal consultation and so will \nnot impede the ability of the leadership to move the business of the \nSenate. However, when the communication rises to the level that a \nMember will object to proceeding, it is appropriate that it be \ndisclosed.\n  Consequently, consistent with the purpose of the bill before us, this \namendment would provide greater transparency of the legislative process \nand increase public confidence in the outcome.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I think Senator Lott, Senator Inhofe, and \nSenator Grassley have said it very well. This amendment is about a \nsimple proposition; and that is, the Senate ought to do its most \nimportant business in public, where every Senator can be held \naccountable. We have offered this bipartisan amendment to eliminate \nsecret holds on the lobbying reform legislation for the same reason \nWilly Sutton robbed banks: Banks are where the money is. And secret \nholds are where the power is.\n  Secret holds are one of the most powerful weapons available to \nlobbyists. I expect that each of our offices has gotten at least one \ncall asking if the office would put a secret hold on a bill or nominee \nin order to kill it without any public debate, and without a lobbyist's \nfingerprints anywhere.\n  Getting a Senator to put a secret hold on a bill is like hitting the \nlobbyist jackpot. Not only is the Senator's identity protected, but so \nis the lobbyist's. A secret hold lets a lobbyist play both sides of the \nstreet and gives lobbyists a victory for their clients without \nalienating potential or future clients.\n  In my view, secret holds are a stealth extension of the lobbying \nworld. It would be particularly ironic if the Senate were to claim it \nwas adopting lobbying reform legislation without doing away with what \nis one of the most powerful tools available to a lobbyist.\n  This has been a bipartisan effort. It has gone on for literally a \ndecade. Senator Lott, to his credit, tried a voluntary approach with \nSenator Daschle. We want to emphasize--for example, the Senator from \nMaine, Ms. Collins, was involved in this--that this in no way \neliminates the right of a Senator to have a consult, to have the \nopportunity to look at legislation, to review it when it comes out of \ncommittee. A Senator can seek that. In my mind, a consult is similar to \na yellow light that says proceed with caution. A hold, on the other \nhand, is similar to a red light, a stop light. It is when a Senator \ndigs in and says they are going to do everything they possibly can to \nblock a piece of legislation from going forward.\n  I want to protect Senators' rights, but Senators' rights need to be \naccompanied by responsibilities. We are talking about legislation that \ncan involve billions of dollars, millions of our citizens, and the \npublic's business ought to be done in public.\n  What this amendment does is ban a staff hold, the so-called rolling \nhold where the hold is passed secretly from Senator to Senator. And \nwhen a Senator exercises the power of a hold to deal with an issue that \nis important to them, in the future, they will be held publicly \naccountable.\n  This is long overdue. Senator Dole, when he was majority leader, \nspoke out on this, more eloquently than perhaps any of us are doing \ntoday. Senator Grassley, myself, Senator Inhofe, Senator Lott believe \nthat it is time to bring sunshine to the Senate and for the Senate to \ndo the people's business in public. I can't think of a more appropriate \nplace to do it than on the lobbying reform bill we are working on \ntoday.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass the amendment and to bring some sunshine \nto the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, shortly we will vote on the Wyden-\nGrassley amendment. First, we will vote on the Collins-Lieberman-McCain \namendment which is the second-degree amendment. I applaud the \ninitiative of Senators Wyden and Grassley. When this amendment first \ncame up, I spoke in favor of it. I believe we do need to end the \npractice of secret holds.\n  I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor to the Wyden-\nGrassley amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Let me say a few final words about the amendment \nSenators\n\n[[Page S2459]]\n\nMcCain, Lieberman, and I have proposed to create an office of public \nintegrity. We are about to vote on that amendment, and then we will \nproceed to vote on Senator Wyden's amendment.\n  I believe our proposal has struck the right balance. I draw this \nconclusion, in part, because my colleagues who are opposed to the \namendment are arguing two conflicting extremes, and both obviously \ncannot be right. On the one hand, some of my colleagues are disparaging \nthe Office of Public Integrity by calling it an independent counsel, by \nimplying that it would be a too powerful, out-of-control entity that \nwould conduct unfair investigations and put Members in peril.\n  On the other hand, we have also heard colleagues during this debate \nsay that the Office of Public Integrity would not have enough power \nbecause it can be overruled by the Ethics Committee. These two \nconflicting and inconsistent positions suggest that, in fact, we have \nstruck the right balance. We have respected the role and the authority \nof the Ethics Committee, but we have strengthened the credibility of \nthe investigative part of an inquiry into allegations of wrongdoing.\n  At the end of the day, the debate and vote on our proposal comes down \nto a simple question. That is, what are we going to do to strengthen \npublic confidence in the integrity of this institution? Regardless of \nhow fine a job the Ethics Committee has done--and it has performed \nwell--the fact remains that public confidence in Congress is near an \nall-time low. I believe the legislation that we have brought forth to \nstrengthen our lobbying disclosure laws, to prohibit practices that \nraise conflicts of interest and, with our amendment, to strengthen the \nenforcement mechanism is critical to strengthening the bond between the \npeople we serve and those of us privileged to be elected to public \noffice.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the modest proposal for a well \nbalanced Office of Public Integrity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the Collins amendment.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. FRIST. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we have made progress today on a very \nimportant bill, a bill that we brought to the floor now several weeks \nago. It is an important bill that reflects upon this institution in \nterms of respect, in terms of integrity, and a bill on which we have \nmade huge progress. Yet it is a bill about which it has come time, I \nthink, really, now, to establish a glidepath to continue debate, allow \ngermane amendments but recognize we want to keep those amendments on \nthe bill itself.\n  I had hoped we would have been able to reach an agreement to sequence \na large number of amendments, but the amendments keep coming. And after \ntalking to both sides of the aisle, I understand that we are not going \nto be able to get time agreements on those amendments. Therefore, my \nonly option at this juncture is to bring this bill to a close with a \ncloture unanimous consent request.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the motion to proceed to the \nmotion to reconsider the failed cloture vote be agreed to, the motion \nto reconsider be agreed to, and the Senate now proceed to a vote on \ninvoking cloture on the underlying bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the legislation now before this body is \nimperfect, but it is sure good. I said before, and I say again, the \nwork done by the Rules Committee and the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee is exemplary. It was bipartisan. They\n\n[[Page S2460]]\n\nbrought pieces of legislation to the floor. It was melded into one, and \nthis is what is now before this body.\n  We have had amendments offered. Some have passed; some have not. As \nthe majority leader has indicated, we tried to get the list of \namendments agreed to. This would go on for weeks. We have immigration. \nI want to get to immigration. I want to come out of here with a good \nlobbying reform bill.\n  As I said, this bill is not perfect, but it contains important \nreforms to strengthen both lobbying disclosure requirements and our own \ninternal efforts in some very significant ways. No one needs to hang \ntheir head in shame about what we have done. It extends and strengthens \na cooling off period for Members and staff, ends gifts and meals for \nlobbyists, requires preapproval and more disclosure for all trips, \nrequires disclosure of job negotiations, prohibits the K-Street Project \nunder Senate rules, eliminates floor privileges for former Members who \nbecome lobbyists, requires more disclosure by lobbyists--and that is an \nunderstatement--requires new disclosure of grassroots lobbying and \nstealth coalitions by business groups, reforms rules regarding \nearmarks, scope of conference and availability of conference reports to \neliminate dead-of-night legislating.\n  This is a good piece of legislation. I would like a lot more, but I \ndon't believe the perfect should get in the way of the good. This is \ngood.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture so we can complete action on \nthis bill quickly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I understand there was no objection.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I reserve the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, if we vote cloture, there will be several \nimportant amendments that will fall, including use of corporate jets, \nincluding earmarking, which is the reason we have the abuses that we \nhave today. I will not support cloture, and I will tell my colleagues \nif we do have cloture, we will revisit those issues.\n  There is no reason any Member of this body should pay only first-\nclass airfare for riding a corporate jet. Earmarking is out of control, \nand it has become a problem with all Americans, and we need to address \nat least those two issues.\n  I hope my colleagues understand if we do invoke cloture, we will be \nrevisiting those issues one way or another. I am disappointed that we \ncould not address those very important aspects.\n  I will not object to the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  By unanimous consent, pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on S. 2349: an \n     original bill to provide greater transparency in the \n     legislative process.\n         Bill Frist, Mitch McConnell, Rick Santorum, Mel Martinez, \n           James Inhofe, Susan Collins, Trent Lott, John E. \n           Sununu, John McCain, Judd Gregg, Norm Coleman, Michael \n           B. Enzi, Wayne Allard, R.F. Bennett, Craig Thomas, \n           Larry E. Craig, George Voinovich, and Christopher Bond.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate \nthat debate on S. 2349, the Legislative Transparency and Accountability \nAct of 2006, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Immigration\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, sometime tomorrow, hopefully, or the next \nday, we are going to move to immigration. There is widespread \nacknowledgment that our immigration system is badly broken. There is a \ncrisis at our borders, and we need a comprehensive strategy to address \nit.\n  Just yesterday, the Senate Judiciary Committee reported a bill with \nstrong bipartisan support which would do much that is necessary to \nrestore order to our immigration system. The committee bill offers real \nsolutions with tough, effective enforcement and smart reforms. The bill \nis not perfect, but it is certainly a good bill. This legislation would \nsecure our borders, crack down on employers who hire illegally, and \nbring undocumented immigrants out of the shadows. I commend Chairman \nSpecter, Ranking Member Leahy, and Senator Kennedy, who has worked on \nthese issues for more than 30 years, and the rest of the committee for \ntheir hard work in completing this bill.\n  I have received assurances from the majority leader that it will be \nin order for Senator Specter to offer the committee-reported bill as \nthe first amendment to Senator Frist's border security bill. That \namendment will be a complete substitute, so if it is adopted by the \nfull Senate, it will completely supersede the Frist bill.\n\n[[Page S2461]]\n\n  This is no different than we handle all other pieces of legislation. \nBased on those assurances, we have consented to vitiate the cloture \nvote--that happened earlier today--and allow the debate to move \nforward.\n  Under the process we have agreed upon, the foundation of the Senate's \nupcoming debate on immigration policy will be the bipartisan committee \nbill.\n  I will have more to say about immigration policy in the coming days. \nFor now, I want to express my satisfaction that the full Senate will be \nallowed to debate the comprehensive, bipartisan immigration bill that \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee reported yesterday. I welcome that \ndebate.\n  Mr. LEAHY, Mr. President, I filed an enforcement amendment to the \nbill on March 7 and look forward to an opportunity to offer that \namendment and have it considered by the Senate. My amendment is the \n``Honest Services Amendment,'' No. 2924.\n  The purpose of my amendment is to articulate more clearly the line \nthat cannot be crossed without incurring criminal liability. If we are \nserious about lobbying reform, the Senate will adopt this amendment. It \nwas only with the indictments of Abramoff, Scanlon, and Cunningham that \nCongress took note of the scandal that has grown over the last years.\n  If we are to restore public confidence, we need to provide better \ntools for Federal prosecutors to combat public corruption in our \nGovernment. I explained this amendment back on March 9, and a copy of \nit is included in the Congressional Record of that day.\n  This amendment creates a better legal framework for combating public \ncorruption than currently exists under our criminal laws. It specifies \nthe crime of Honest Services Fraud Involving Members of Congress and \nprohibits defrauding or depriving the American people of the honest \nservices of their elected representatives.\n  Under this amendment, lobbyists who improperly seek to influence \nlegislation and other official matters by giving expensive gifts, \nlavish entertainment and travel and inside advice on investments to \nMembers of Congress and their staff would be held criminally liable for \ntheir actions.\n  The law also prohibits Members of Congress and their staff from \naccepting these types of gifts and favors or holding hidden financial \ninterests in return for being influenced in carrying out their official \nduties. Violators are subject to a criminal fine and up to 20 years \nimprisonment, or both.\n  This legislation strengthens the tools available to Federal \nprosecutors to combat public corruption in our Government. The \namendment makes it possible for Federal prosecutors to bring public \ncorruption cases without all of the hurdles of having to prove bribery \nor of working with the limited and nonspecific honest services fraud \nlanguage in current Federal law.\n  The amendment also provides lobbyists, Members of Congress, and other \nindividuals with much needed notice and clarification as to what kind \nof conduct triggers this criminal offense.\n  In addition, my amendment authorizes $25 million in additional \nFederal funds over each of the next 4 years, to give Federal \nprosecutors needed resources to investigate corruption and to hold \nlobbyists and other individuals accountable for improperly seeking to \ninfluence legislation and other official matters.\n  The unfolding public corruption investigations involving lobbyist \nJack Abramoff and MZM demonstrate that unethical conduct by public \nofficials has broad-ranging impact. These scandals undermine the \npublic's confidence in our Government. Earlier this month, the \nWashington Post reported that as an outgrowth of the Cunningham \ninvestigation, Federal investigators are now looking into contracts \nawarded by the Pentagon's new intelligence agency, the \nCounterintelligence Field Activity, to MZM, Inc., a company run by \nMitchell J. Wade who recently pleaded guilty to conspiring to bribe Mr. \nCunningham.\n  The American people expect, and deserve, to be confident that their \nrepresentatives in Congress perform their legislative duties in a \nmanner that is beyond reproach and that is in the public interest.\n  Because I strongly believe that public service is a public trust, I \nurge all Senators to support this amendment. If we are serious about \nreform and cleaning up this scandal we will do so. I hope the \nRepublican leadership and the managers of the bill will accord me the \nopportunity to offer the amendment and improve the underlying measure.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate resumes consideration of the bill tomorrow morning, Senator \nFeingold be recognized to offer his amendment No. 2962 relating to the \ndefinition of ``lobbyist'' for purposes of gifts; provided further that \nthere be 40 minutes equally divided for debate prior to a vote in \nrelation to the amendment, with no second-degree amendments in order to \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding the adjournment of the Senate, all time until we resume \nthe bill tomorrow count against the time limit under the provisions of \nrule XXII. I further ask unanimous consent that all first-degree \namendments that qualify under rule XXII be offered no later than 11 \na.m. on Wednesday, other than a managers' amendment to be cleared by \nthe managers and the two leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier today, my colleague from Alabama, \nSenator Sessions, alleged that I have a ``hold'' on the Intelligence \nAuthorization Act. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  I know that in the heat of debate on the Senate floor, words can \nsometimes come out faster than a Member might intend, so I harbor no \nill will toward my colleague. But in the interest of accuracy, I wish \nto set the record straight.\n  Last autumn, many of us were shocked to read allegations in the press \nof secret clandestine prisons operated around the world by the CIA as \npart of the war on terror. Congress has a responsibility to perform \noversight in all things, including the intelligence community's conduct \nin the war on terror. In discussing this amendment last fall, I said, \nand I repeat today, no one is passing judgment on whether these alleged \nfacilities should be closed. We are simply saying that Congress--and \nspecifically the duly established intelligence committees of the House \nand Senate--need to know what is going on.\n  On November 10, 2005, I offered an amendment to the National Defense \nAuthorization Act requiring the Director of National Intelligence to \nprovide a secret report to the Intelligence Committees of the House and \nSenate on the operation, past or present, of these alleged facilities. \nIt would also have required a report on the planned disposition of \nthose allegedly held at these facilities and a determination as to \nwhether interrogation techniques at these facilities were consistent \nwith U.S. obligations under the Geneva Convention and the Convention \nagainst Torture.\n  In debating this amendment, I was delighted to work with my \ncolleague, Senator Roberts, the chairman of the Senate Select Committee \non Intelligence, and his vice chairman, Senator Rockefeller, to perfect \nthe text of the amendment so they could support it. It passed with \noverwhelming bipartisan support by a vote of 82 to 9.\n  About 1 month later, the House of Representative voted 228 to 187 to \nurge\n\n[[Page S2462]]\n\nHouse-Senate negotiators to include the amendment in their conference \nreport. The House Armed Services Committee, however, was concerned that \nthe amendment was beyond the scope of their jurisdiction and the \nprovision was stripped out in conference.\n  I turned then to the Intelligence Authorization Act and again worked \nwith Senator Roberts and Senator Rockefeller to prepare the amendment \nanew for inclusion in that legislation. The amendment was identical to \nthe provision passed previously in the Senate and endorsed by the House \nand was cleared by Senator Roberts for passage by unanimous consent. \nBut someone objected to the unanimous consent request to pass this \nvital bill by voice vote. Since that time, the legislation has lingered \nbecause someone doesn't want a vote on this amendment or the amendments \noffered by my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy.\n  I know my friend from Alabama voted against my amendment when it was \non the floor in November. I am sure he would vote against it again. We \ncan agree to disagree on this issue, but his assertion that I have \nplaced a hold on the intelligence bill is simply not true.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, earlier today, the Senator from Alabama, \nSenator Sessions said that Senator Kerry and I objected to Senate \nconsideration of the intelligence authorization bill because we wish to \noffer amendments.\n  In fact, neither Senator Kerry nor I have objected to this bill and \nno other Democrat has objected to considering it. The bill is cleared \non the Democratic side. That means an unidentified Republican Senator \nor Senators have placed a hold on the bill and are preventing the \nSenate from considering it.\n  I do have two amendments to the bill. My first amendment would \nrequire the administration provide to the Intelligence Committee with \nthe presidential daily briefs on Iraq from 1997 to the first day of the \nIraq war as part of the committee's investigation on the use of prewar \nintelligence. I would certainly be willing to support a time agreement \nallowing reasonable debate and a vote on the amendment.\n  My second amendment would guarantee that detainees held by the \nintelligence community would be treated humanely, and that treatment \nwould be verified independently.\n  Apparently, to prevent debate on this very important issue, a \nRepublican Senator is willing to let the whole intelligence bill fail. \nThat's an outrage.\n  It's important for the Senate to approve the intelligence \nauthorization bill, and it's important for the Senate to get to the \nbottom of the abuse of intelligence the administration used to justify \nwar.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/28/senate-section/article/S2462-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GREEK INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I am honored to address the Senate in \ncelebration of the 185th anniversary of Greek independence. On March \n25, 1821, the Greeks revolted against nearly 400 years of repressive \nrule by the Ottoman Empire and began their journey toward independence.\n  And in honor of that historic day, the United States and Greece stand \ntogether in our commitment to the principles of democracy, freedom, and \nindependence.\n  In honor of that day, we celebrate the achievements and contributions \nof the Greek state and her people. We honor Greece's accomplishments in \nhistory, science, philosophy, mathematics, literature, and art.\n  In honor of that day, we recognize and celebrate our own democratic \nheritage in this Nation. The Greeks believed in self-governance, and \nour Founding Fathers incorporated the ancient Greeks' political \nexperience and philosophy when they formed our representative \ndemocracy. Greek ideas of government and freedom have had an immense \nand unparalleled influence in the world and in this Nation. And I would \nlike to thank the Greek people for leading the way and giving us the \ninspiration to pursue these ideals.\n  In honor of that day, we celebrate the contributions of the more than \n1 million Greek-Americans in this country. In New Jersey alone, there \nare over 61,000 Greek-Americans who contribute daily to the economic, \npolitical, and cultural fabric of this Nation.\n  Over the years, not only has Greece supported the United States in \nevery major international conflict in the last century, but it has \nstood by this country after the September 11 terrorist attacks. And \nGreece generously supported us with aid after the devastating effects \nof Hurricane Katrina here on our soil.\n  And we should stand with Greece and protect the human and religious \nrights of the Ecumenical Patriarch. This is an issue that not only \naffects the Greek community but is important to all communities. We \nmust protect the rights of the Ecumenical Patriarchate as Turkey has: \nrefused to recognize the Ecumenical Patriarchate's international status \nand its significance to Orthodox Christians around the world, impeded \ntraining for the clergy while requiring that all candidates for the \nHoly Synod be Turkish nationals; confiscated 75 percent of the \nEcumenical Patriarchal properties, and levied a 42 percent retroactive \ntax on the Balukli Hospital which is run by the Ecumenical \nPatriarchate.\n  Last year, as Member of the House, I authored a resolution calling on \nTurkey to eliminate all forms of discrimination and to respect the \nhuman and religious rights of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. And that \nlanguage sent a strong message to Turkey when it was included in the \nState Department authorization bill which passed the House last year.\n  Now, as a U.S. Senator, I will remain firm in my position and will \ncontinue to work hard to make sure Turkey ends its discrimination and \npersecution against the Ecumenical Patriarchate.\n  As Aeschines, one of ancient Greece's more gifted orators once said, \n``In a democracy, it is the laws that guard the person of the citizen \nand the constitution of the state, whereas the despot and the oligarch \nfind their protection in suspicion and in armed guards.''\n  From the history of democracy to the religious freedom and human \nrights of the Ecumenical patriarchate, we in this Nation share this \ncommon vision with Greece and her people.\n  And the United States of America stands proudly with Greece in honor \nof our shared commitment to democracy, freedom, and independence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/28/senate-section/article/S2462-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2462-S2463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      NOMINATION OF WILLIAM MYERS TO 9TH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to note that it has now been \nmore than one full year that the nomination of William Myers to the 9th \nCircuit Court of Appeals has been pending on the Senate Calendar. On \nMarch 17, 2005, the Judiciary Committee approved the Myers nomination \nby a vote of 10-8. Unfortunately, this was not the first time Mr. Myers \nhas been approved by the Judiciary Committee. We are also approaching \nthe two-year anniversary when Bill Myers was approved by the Judiciary \nCommittee in the 108th Congress on April 1, 2004.\n  Last year, with the so-called ``Gang of 14'' agreement, many pending \nnominees finally received their long-overdue up or down votes on the \nSenate floor. Unfortunately, Bill Myers was not one of those nominees, \ndespite the fact that he has the support of a bipartisan majority of \nthis Senate. On July 20, 2004, Bill Myers received 53 votes to end the \nfilibuster on his nomination. The time has come to give Bill Myers his \nlong-overdue up or down vote on the Senate floor. His nomination has \nbeen pending on the Senate calendar for a full year now and I urge the \nSenate leadership to bring this nomination up for a vote.\n  Bill Myers is a highly respected attorney who was approved \nunanimously by this Senate in 2001 to serve as Solicitor of the \nDepartment of Interior. Former Democratic Governor of Idaho Cecil \nAndrus, who also served as Interior Secretary in the Carter \nadministration, says that Bill Myers possesses ``the necessary personal \nintegrity, judicial temperament and legal experience'' as well as ``the \nability to act fairly on matters of law that will come before him on \nthe court.'' As a nominee to fill an Idaho seat on the 9th Circuit, \nBill Myers has the full support of the entire Idaho congressional \ndelegation.\n  Bill Myers is a qualified nominee and there is no justification for \ncontinuing to filibuster or delay his nomination. My fellow Idahoans \nand all residents in the 9th Circuit deserve to have their appeals \nheard in a timely manner. To do this, we must fill all vacancies on\n\n[[Page S2463]]\n\nthe court in a timely manner. I join with my colleague from Idaho, \nSenator Craig, in urging this Senate to hold an up or down vote on the \nnomination of William Myers to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, just before we recessed 2 weeks ago, many \ncelebrated the Irish national holiday commemorating the Patron Saint \nPatrick. That day also marked an important anniversary for another man: \nWilliam G. Myers. Mr. Myers' nomination was confirmed by the Senate \nJudiciary committee exactly one year ago on that day, and he has since \nbeen waiting for confirmation by the Senate.\n  My colleagues know that this is the second time Mr. Myers will be \nconsidered by the Senate for a seat on the 9th Circuit Court of \nAppeals. It is important to note that in the previous Congress a \nmajority of the Senate voted to confirm him. Due to the circumstances \nof that time, however, his confirmation required a supermajority. I am \nconfident that the current Congress will see the fine qualities of Mr. \nMyers, and he will receive a full bipartisan vote for confirmation.\n  Mr. Myers will be an advocate of truth and justice. He was confirmed \nin the past as Solicitor for the Department of the Interior and is a \nvery talented and capable candidate. His tremendous background \ndemonstrates that he will provide clear and precise judgment and \nleadership to the Western States in the Ninth Circuit. Mr. Myers has \nproven throughout his professional career that he understands the \nculture and heritage of the Western States and the issues critical to \nthat region. His professional history demonstrates that he will show \nresponsibility and intellect in every decision that he makes as a \njudge.\n  I strongly support William Myers' nomination to the Ninth Circuit \nCourt. He deserves our fair consideration for this position, and it is \nmy hope that he will be given an up-or-down vote in the Senate. The \nPresident has correctly selected this highly qualified nominee, and I \nask that the Senate move quickly to confirm him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/28/senate-section/article/S2463-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO SENATOR BEALL\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to pay my respects to a \ntrue Marylander who passed away last week, Senator J. Glenn Beall, Jr. \nHe will be remembered for devoting his life to public service as a \nnaval officer, a State delegate, a Member of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, and a U.S. Senator.\n  Senator Beall was born in Cumberland, MD, to a prominent and \nextraordinary Maryland family who shared his dedication to improving \nthe lives of all Marylanders. His father, J. Glenn Beall, was a \nmoderate Republican Congressman who served in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives for a decade and the U.S. Senate for 12 years. Senator \nBeall Jr. grew up following his father's campaigns in Western Maryland \nand went on to follow in his footsteps.\n  Senator Beall's long and distinguished career in both the public and \nprivate sector has set a high bar for those of us who follow in his \nfootsteps. His example reminds us to eschew capricious fame and the \never-changing political winds and to focus on the substantive issues of \nthe day.\n  As a freshman Senator in 1986, I sought and received Senator Beall's \nadvice and counsel on how to best serve the people of Maryland, and \nmost particularly, the residents of western Maryland. His advice was \nspecific, immediate, and realizable. It added greatly to my own efforts \nto succeed. I will miss his counsel and the true collegial spirit that \ngoverned our interaction.\n  Senator Beall had a lot of Senate know-how. His political priorities \nfocused on health, preservation, and transportation. He was known for \ngoing across party lines in an effort to work on a bipartisan basis. It \nwas a pleasure to work with him.\n  Most recently, Senator Beall was the founding chairman of the Canal \nPlace Preservation & Development Authority, which was the direct result \nof his tireless efforts to establish the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal \nNational Historical Park in the early 1970s. Together, I worked with \nSenator Beall to create economic development opportunities throughout \nwestern Maryland. His constituents throughout the State, and especially \nin the region, are indebted to him for the creative manner in which he \nled the preservation, rehabilitation, development, and management of \nthe Canal Place Preservation District.\n  Throughout his life and long-lived political career, Senator Beall \nstrived to serve the needs of Marylanders in the State legislature, in \nthe U.S. Congress, and at the Canal Place Preservation & Development \nAuthority. I join my constituents in mourning the loss of a remarkable \ngentleman who had Maryland in his heart, and bid farewell to an old \nfriend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/28/senate-section/article/S2463-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         GRATITUDE FOR INTEGRITY, EXPERTISE AND PROFESSIONALISM\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, at the end of March, I will be losing a \nvaluable member of my legislative team as she returns to her host \nagency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Since early 2005, \nLarisa Collado has served as a legislative fellow in my Washington, DC, \noffice. Her extensive expertise on technical financial intricacies, \ncoupled with her diligence, enthusiasm and professionalism has made her \nan invaluable, albeit temporary, member of my staff.\n  As chairman of the Senate Banking Subcommittee on International Trade \nand Finance and the designated Senate lead for regulatory relief \nmatters, I am actively engaged in a wide portfolio of financial issues. \nDuring her service, Larisa has been critical to advancing my \nlegislative agenda by meeting with stakeholders and analyzing and \nrecommending legislative initiatives. She has effectively utilized her \nfirsthand experiences as a regulator when working on a number of \ncontroversial issues. Without her able assistance, my efforts to \npromote financial services regulatory restructuring would have been \nseriously undermined. Larisa has demonstrated time and again the \nwillingness to revisit detailed regulatory provisions without losing \npatience or drive. When others would have turned to other projects, she \nstayed committed to this long-overdue but sorely overlooked facet of \nthe financial services sector.\n  Larisa has also demonstrated keen perceptivity and integrity with \nregard to the proper balance of personal privacy protection and \nlegitimate law enforcement--a necessary component of congressional \noversight and reform of our Nation's financial markets. Idahoans and \nAmericans across the country are becoming increasingly aware of the \nvulnerability of their personal financial information. I looked to her \nfor guidance and analysis of the proper ways to ensure that financial \ninformation remains private. At the same time, Larisa has also been a \nkey component of my efforts to work with Idaho Hispanics to educate \nthose who need help with financial literacy and understanding the \nbenefits of the financial services community.\n  Larisa has proven herself a highly effective professional and I have \nno doubt she will continue to excel at the FDIC in a career already \nmarked by superior performance and achievement. I thank her for her \ncommitment to public service and to Idaho these past months, and wish \nher well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/28/senate-section/article/S2463-3", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        A FRIEND TO IDAHO WHEAT\n\n Mr. CRAPO.

Mr. President, I am pleased today to recognize \nthe Middlebury College women's ice hockey team for its recent NCAA \nDivision III National Championship--the school's third in as many years \nand its fifth national title in the last 7 years.\n  In defeating Plattsburgh State by a score of 3 to 1 on March 18, the \nPanthers finished their season 27 to 2, tying the school record for \nvictories. The Panthers had four players named to the all-tournament \nteam including Emily Quizon, the American Hockey Coaches Association's \nNational Player of the Year.\n  I am proud this hockey dynasty is being built in the Green Mountain \nState. I am particularly pleased that the student athletes who have \ncreated this dynasty are doing so while studying at a top-notch \nacademic institution. The demanding academics at Middlebury make the \naccomplishments of these great student athletes that much more \nimpressive.\n  Since Bill Mandigo took over as the head coach of the Panthers in \n1988, the women's team has posted a record of 329-86-11. That gives \nCoach Mandigo the most wins by a women's hockey coach at any level. \nAlthough the team will graduate five seniors this May, Middlebury will \nreturn seven of its top eight scorers from this season, and I am sure \nthat Coach Mandigo's program will continue to develop successful \nstudents and athletes.\n  I congratulate each member of the team: head coach Bill Mandigo, \nassistant coach Jean Butler, Abby Kurtz-Phelan, Shannon Tarrant, Emily \nMcNamara, Rose Babst, Kerry Kiley, Liz Yale-Loehr, Molly Vitt, Karen \nLevin, Gillian Paul, Shannon Sylvester, Emily Quizon, Annmarie Cellino, \nRandi Dumont, Erika Nakamura, Gloria Velez, Alison Graddock, Margaret \nMacDonald, Lacey Farrell, Ellen Sargent, Tania Kenny, Abby Smith, Nina \nDaugherty, and Kate Kogut.\n  Again, congratulations to the Middlebury College Panthers for their \nthird straight national championship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/28/senate-section/article/S2464-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TRIBUTE TO THE MIDDLEBURY PANTHERS MEN'S ICE HOCKEY TEAM\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nMiddlebury College men's ice hockey team on winning its third straight \nNCAA Division III National Championship with a victory over St. Norbert \nCollege on March 19.\n  After eight national titles in the last 12 years, there is little new \nthat can be said about Middlebury hockey. The eight national \nchampionships, including this recent three-peat, speak for themselves. \nUnder the leadership of Coach Bill Beaney, the Panthers have achieved \nan unprecedented level of success, making them the envy of college \nhockey programs everywhere.\n  Last week, in reaction to the Panthers' hat trick of national titles, \nthe Burlington Free Press called Middlebury hockey players ``talented, \ndetermined, motivated student-athletes . . .'' Although this \ndescription goes without saying, it reminds us that this great hockey \nteam is comprised of students that must balance their athletic and \nacademic responsibilities. At a college as academically renowned and \ndemanding as Middlebury, balancing these responsibilities is no easy \ntask, and these great student athletes must be commended for their \nefforts both on and off the ice. As a U.S. Senator from Vermont, I am \nproud to have such a great academic institution in our State, and I am \nalso proud of the incredible hockey program Middlebury has developed.\n  I congratulate each member of the team: head coach Bill Beaney, \nassistant coach Chris LaPerle, assistant coach Frank Sacheli, student \nassistant Ryan Cahill, manager Ryan McQuillan, Ross Cherry, Tom \nMaldonado, Jed McDonald, Samuel Driver, Jack Kinder, Ryan Harrington, \nMickey Gilchrist, Darwin Hunt, Jamie McKenna, Eric LaFreniere, Justin \nGaines, Evgeny Saidachev, Robert MacIntyre, Mack Cummins, Jeff Smith, \nBrett Shirreffs, John Sales, Doug Raeder, Kyle Koziara, Ian Drummond, \nRichie Fuld, Yen-I Chen, Jocko DeCarolis, Leonard Badeau, Mason \nGraddock, and Scott Bartlett.\n  Again, congratulations, Panthers, on another national title and \nanother fantastic season.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/28/senate-section/article/S2464-3", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNITION OF ARTHUR WINSTON\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very pleased to take a few \nmoments to recognize the amazing life accomplishments of Arthur Winston \nas he is honored by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation \nAuthority--MTA--family during his retirement and 100th birthday \ncelebration.\n  Arthur Winston began his association with the MTA at the young age of \n15. He would assist his father who was employed by the maintenance \ndepartment for one of MTA's predecessors, the Pacific Electric Railway \nCompany. In 1924, Arthur began his career with the Pacific Electric \nRailway Company. After a brief period of separation between 1928 \nthrough 1934, he returned at the age of 28 and began 72 years of \ncontinuous work. In total, Arthur has devoted 76 years of his life to \npublic service and has missed only day of work since 1934, which \noccurred when his wife passed away in 1988.\n  In 1996, Arthur Winston received a congressional citation from \nPresident Bill Clinton as ``Employee of the Century.'' In 1997, the MTA \nboard of directors named the agency's bus operating division in South \nCentral Los Angeles, Chesterfield Square, after him. He has also \nappeared on the Oprah Winfry television show where he was invited to \nshare his life's story with her television viewing audience.\n  Arthur Winston was born in Oklahoma on March 22, 1906 before Oklahoma \nwas officially recognized as a State. He and his family moved to Los \nAngeles in 1918, when Arthur was 12. He attended Jefferson High School \nand graduated in 1922. Currently assigned to the bus operations \ndivision that bears his name, Arthur serves as an attendant leader and \ndirects a crew of 11 employees. Through their efforts, Los Angeles city \nbuses are properly maintained for use by the city's residents.\n  I invite all of my colleagues to join me and the members of the \nMetropolitan Transportation Authority family in commending Arthur \nWinston for his 100th Birthday and his 76 years of service and \ndedication to MTA and the city of Los Angeles.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/28/senate-section/article/S2464-4", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JOSEPH WHITEHEAD\n\n Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nJoseph Whitehead, an officer with the Bibb County Drug Squad in Macon, \nGA who was tragically killed in the line of duty on the early morning \nof Thursday, March 23, 2006.\n  An 11-year veteran of the Bibb County Sheriff's Department, Joseph \nWhitehead was known as an exemplary law enforcement officer who was \ndedicated to making our neighborhoods safer by fighting drugs in Middle \nGeorgia. His steadfast commitment to fighting gangs and drugs that \nplague our communities is commendable and will be a lasting legacy for \nhis family, his fellow law enforcement officers, and the citizens of \nMiddle Georgia.\n  Joseph Whitehead's tragic death is a sad reminder that our law \nenforcement personnel put themselves in harm's way every day to make \nthis Nation safer and more secure for our children and grandchildren.\n  Joseph Whitehead will be remembered as a man who loved his family, a \ntrue leader, a team player who loved his job, and a man who gave it his \nall every single day. He is a true American hero.\n  Georgia's law enforcement community and our entire State grieve his \ntragic loss. May God bless him, and may God bless his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/28/senate-section/article/S2464-5", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2464-S2465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT MAJOR ALFORD L.

He retires after 36 years \nof dedicated service to his country and the U.S. Marine Corps.\n  The consummate Marine, he typifies every desirable characteristic of \na staff Non-Commissioned Officer, NCO--unsurpassed leadership, \nmentorship, guidance, courage, and dedication. Sergeant Major McMichael \nhas served his\n\n[[Page S2465]]\n\ncountry in tours throughout the world. He has provided leadership to \ngenerations of marines through tours of duty as sergeant major of the \nMarine Corps Officer Candidates School, 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit, \nthe 1st Marine Aircraft Wing, Headquarters U.S. Marine Corps Manpower \nand Reserve Affairs Division, and the 14th sergeant major of the Marine \nCorps.\n  His career culminated in his appointment as the first senior \nnoncommissioned officer for Allied Command Operations to Supreme \nHeadquarters Allied Powers Europe, the strategic NATO headquarters in \nMons, Belgium. In that capacity, Sergeant Major McMichael has been \ninstrumental in developing and elevating the role of the \nnoncommissioned officer in the militaries of NATO member countries in \norder to enhance their military effectiveness.\n  With limited resources and with purpose of conviction, Sergeant Major \nMcMichael has been responsible for the Armed Forces of predominantly \nformer Soviet-block nations to adopt professional noncommissioned \nofficer and staff noncommissioned officer programs. This momentous \nfeat, accomplished virtually singlehandedly, is a landmark in the \nAlliance's 21st Century transformation. The United States and the NATO \nAlliance have been most fortunate to have had Sergeant Major McMichael \nwithin their ranks for over three decades.\n  The Department of the Navy, the U.S. Marine Corps, Congress, and the \nAmerican people have been served extraordinarily well by this dedicated \nAmerican. Members of this Congress will not soon forget the leadership, \nservice, and dedication of Sergeant Major McMichael. He will be missed, \nyet his contributions will resonate far and deeply into the \ninstitutions to which he so well and faithfully devoted his life. From \na grateful nation, we bestow our profound appreciation to Sergeant \nMajor McMichael, his lovely wife Rita, and their daughter Portia, and \noffer our very best as they end an important chapter in their lives and \nembark upon a new journey.

A bill to prohibit United States assistance to develop or \npromote any rail connections or railway-related connections that \ntraverse or connect Baku, Azerbaijan, Tbilisi, Georgia, and Kars, \nTurkey, and that specifically exclude cities in Armenia; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nblock U.S. support for yet another anti-Armenian initiative.\n  In numerous cases over the last few years, the Turkish government has \nmethodically sought to isolate Armenia economically, politically and \nsocially. One of the most egregious examples was the imposition of a \n1993 blockade against Armenia in support of Azerbaijan's war against \nKarabakh Armenians.\n  The Turkish government has routinely sought to exclude Armenia from \nprojects that would benefit the economies of the countries of the South \nCaucasus. The latest example of this policy is the proposal to build a \nnew rail line that would connect Turkey, Georgia and Azerbaijan. \nSimilar to the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline, this rail link would specifically \ngo around Armenia.\n  Now, geographically, we all know that a pipeline or rail line that \nseeks to connect Turkey, Georgia and Azerbaijan would have to pass \nthrough Armenia. One would have to make a special effort to bypass \nArmenia.\n  The U.S. should not endorse Turkey and Azerbaijan's politically \nmotivated attempt to isolate Armenia.\n  I therefore rise today in opposition to this plan, and to introduce \nlegislation, along with my colleague, Senator Santorum, that would bar \nU.S. support and funding for a rail link connecting Georgia and Turkey, \nand which specifically excludes Armenia. This project is estimated to \ncost up to $800 million and would take three years to complete. The aim \nof this costly approach, as publicly stated by Azeri President Aliyev, \nis to isolate Armenia by enhancing the ongoing Turkish and Azerbaijani \nblockades and to keep the existing Turkey-Armenia-Georgia rail link \nshut down. This ill-conceived project runs counter to U.S. policy, \nignores the standing Kars-Gyumri rail route, is politically and \neconomically flawed and serves to destabilize the region.\n  U.S. policy in the South Caucasus seeks to foster regional \ncooperation and economic integration and supports open borders and \ntransport and communication corridors. U.S. support for this project \nwould run counter to that policy which is why Senator Santorum and I \nare introducing this legislation today.\n  We cannot continue to stoke the embers of regional conflict by \nsupporting projects that deliberately exclude one of the region's most \nimportant members. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 2462. A bill to permit startup partnership and S corporations to \nelect taxable years other than required years; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will \noffer small businesses greater flexibility in complying with their tax \nobligations. This legislation is one of a series of proposals that, \nonce enacted, will reduce not only the amount of taxes that small \nbusinesses pay, but also will reduce the administrative burden that \nsaddles small companies when trying to comply with the tax laws.\n  The proposal that I am introducing today will permit start-up small \nbusiness owners to use a taxable year other than the calendar year if \nthey generally earn fewer than $5 million during the tax year.\n  Before I talk about the specifics of this particular provision, let \nme first explain why it is so critical that we begin evaluating how we \ncan reduce the administrative burden of the tax code. As is well-known \nsmall businesses are the backbone of our Nation's economy. According to \nthe Small Business Administration, small businesses represent 99 \npercent all employers, employ 51 percent of the private-sector \nworkforce, and contribute 51 percent of the private sector output.\n  Yet, despite the fact that small businesses are the real job-creators \nfor our Nation's economy, the current tax system is placing an entirely \nunreasonable burden on them when trying to satisfy their tax \nobligations. The current tax code imposes a large, and expensive, \nburden on all taxpayers in terms of satisfying their reporting and \nrecordkeeping obligations. The problem, though, is that small companies \nare disadvantaged most in terms of the money and time spent in \nsatisfying their tax obligation.\n  For example, according to the Small Business Administration's Office \nof Advocacy, small businesses spend an astounding 8 billion hours each \nyear complying with government reports. They also spend more than 80 \npercent of this time on completing tax forms. What's even more \ntroubling is that companies that employ fewer than 20 employees spend \nnearly $1,304 per employee in tax compliance costs; an amount that is \nnearly 67 percent more than larger firms.\n  These statistics are disturbing for several reasons. First, the fact \nthat small businesses are being required to spend so much money on \ncompliance costs means they have fewer earnings to reinvest into their \nbusiness. This, in turn, means that they have less money to spend on \nnew equipment or on worker training, which unfortunately has an adverse \neffect on their overall production and the economy as a whole.\n  Second, the fact that small business owners are required to make such \na sizeable investment of their time into completing paperwork means \nthey have less time to spend on doing what they do best--namely running \ntheir business and creating jobs.\n  Let me be clear that I am in no way suggesting that small business \nowners are unique in having to pay income taxes, and I'm certainly not \nexpecting them to receive a free pass. What I'm asking for, though, is \na change to make the tax code fairer and simpler so that small \ncompanies can satisfy this obligation without having to expend the \namount of resources that they do currently.\n  For that reason, the package of proposals that I have introduced will \nprovide not only targeted, affordable tax relief to small business \nowners, but also simpler rules under the tax code. By simplifying the \ntax code, small\n\n[[Page S2470]]\n\nbusiness owners will be able to satisfy their tax obligation in a \ncheaper, more efficient manner, allowing them to be able to devote more \ntime and resources to their business.\n  Specifically, the proposal that I am introducing today will permit \nmore taxpayers to use the taxable year most suitable to their business \ncycle. Until 1986, businesses could elect the taxable year-end that \nmade the most economic sense for the business. In 1986, Congress passed \nlegislation requiring partnerships and S corporations, many of which \nare small businesses, to adopt a December 31 year-end. The tax code \ndoes provide alternatives to the calendar year for small businesses, \nbut the compliance costs and administrative burdens associated with \nthese alternatives prove to be too high for most small businesses to \nutilize.\n  Meanwhile, C corporations, as large corporations often are, receive \nmuch more flexibility in their choice of taxable year. A C corporation \ncan adopt either a calendar year or any fiscal year for tax purposes, \nas along as it keeps its books on that basis. This creates the unfair \nresult of allowing larger businesses with greater resources greater \nflexibility in choosing a taxable year than smaller firms with fewer \nresources. This simply does not make sense to me. My bill changes these \nexisting rules so that more small businesses will be able to use the \ntaxable year that best suits their business.\n  Importantly, these changes will not reduce the amount of taxes a \nsmall business pays by even one dollar. The overall amount of taxes a \nqualifying small business pays will remain the same. This bill simply \npermits more taxpayers to use a taxable year other than the calendar \nyear and makes tax compliance easier.\n  This bill is good policy and common sense. I look forward to working \nwith the bill's cosponsor, Senator Lincoln, in providing small \nbusinesses with more flexibility in meeting their tax obligations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2462\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate as wilderness certain National Forest \nSystem land in the State of New Hampshire; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with \nmy friend, the senior Senator from New Hampshire, Judd Gregg, which \nwill designate approximately 34,500 acres of forest land in the State \nof New Hampshire as wilderness. Our bill, the New Hampshire Wilderness \nAct of 2006, will enact the recommended wilderness designations as set \nforth in the Forest Service Management Plan for the White Mountain \nNational Forest.\n  Established under the Weeks Act of 1911, the White Mountain National \nForest consists of nearly 800,000 acres--732,000 acres in the State of \nNew Hampshire and 65,000 acres more in Maine. Over 6 million people \nvisit the White Mountain National Forest annually, making it one of the \nmost popular National Forests in the Nation.\n  In November of 2005, the Forest Service recommended the designation \nof additional acreage as wilderness in its management plan for the \nWhite Mountain National Forest. The bill that Senator Gregg and I are \nintroducing today, the New Hampshire Wilderness Act of 2006, \nincorporates the recommendations of this management plan by designating \nsome 23,700 acres in the area of the Wild River as wilderness, and \nadding another 10,800 acres to the existing Sandwich Range Wilderness. \nThis land would remain as White Mountain National Forest land under the \nprotection of the National Wilderness Preservation System. Similar \nlegislation is to be introduced in the House of Representatives by our \nNew Hampshire colleagues, Representative Charles Bass and \nRepresentative Jeb Bradley.\n  With the passage of the Wilderness Act in 1964, Congress set out to \npermanently preserve areas of natural beauty for the public to enjoy; \nareas ``where the earth and its community of life are\n\n[[Page S2471]]\n\nuntrammeled by man.'' New Hampshire was one of the original States in \n1964 to have wilderness designated with the establishment of the Great \nGulf Wilderness, and it reflects the view in our State that Granite \nStaters place a premium on safeguarding our natural heritage for future \ngenerations. In New Hampshire, we presently have four wilderness areas \ncomprising more than 102,800 acres; and with the passage of this bill, \nwe will expand one current wilderness area and create a fifth.\n  In New Hampshire, we have a tradition of multiple use for the \nconsideration of our forest lands. In the White Mountain National \nForest, it is generally understood that decisions affecting the forest \nare vetted thoroughly and that consensus is the guideline by which \npolicies are implemented. Indeed, the development of the White Mountain \nNational Forest Management Plan is one of the few times in the last 30 \nyears that the final decision on how a particular National Forest will \nbe managed over the next 15 years was not subject to an administrative \nappeal by concerned citizens.\n  As my colleagues know, wilderness areas consist of Federal lands that \nare permanently reserved from such activities as mining, logging, road \nconstruction, vehicular traffic, and building construction. By law, the \nestablishment of new wilderness must be approved by Congress. That \npresents a unique responsibility on the part of lawmakers to reflect \nthe views of community leaders, residents, visitors and other \ninterested parties in designating wilderness. Given the consensus \napproach they undertook in their decision-making process for the White \nMountain National Forest, we chose to pattern our legislation on the \nrecommendations set forth by the Forest Service.\n  One need only experience the beauty of the White Mountain National \nForest once to understand the need to preserve it for future \ngenerations. The Forest Service has done an admirable job in putting \ntogether a Forest Management Plan that all can support. I am pleased to \nintroduce this measure with Senator Gregg, and I encourage my \ncolleagues to give quick consideration to our legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the New Hampshire \nWilderness Act of 2006 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2463\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to revise a provision relating to a repayment \nobligation of the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation under the Fort McDowell \nIndian Community Water Rights Settlement Act of 1990, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nrevise the Fort McDowell Indian Community Water Rights Settlement Act \nof 1990 in order to bring the Settlement Act process to an orderly \nconclusion. The 1990 Act ratified a negotiated settlement of the Fort \nMcDowell Yavapai Nation's water entitlement to flow from the Verde \nRiver. The Department of the Interior provided technical assistance in \ncrafting this legislation. I am pleased to be joined by Senator Kyl as \nan original cosponsor of this bill.\n  As part of Water Rights settlement, Congress authorized and directed \nthe Secretary of the Interior to provide the Fort McDowell Yavapai \nNation a no-interest loan pursuant to the Small Reclamation Project \nAct, in the amount of $13 million, to construct facilities for the \nconveyance and delivery of water to 1,584 acres on the Fort McDowell \nreservation. Prior to construction of the irrigation system, the \nDepartment of the Interior conducted its environmental review pursuant \nto NEPA. The review revealed that 227 of the acres to be irrigated were \nsignificant cultural sites and the Secretary subsequently withdrew \nthose acres from development. The Department proposed to develop \nreplacement lands, subject to the availability of funding. To date, \nhowever, the replacement lands have not been developed and the \nsettlement agreement has been left uncompleted.\n  In October 2005, the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation and the Department \nof the Interior agreed that the Department's environmental mitigation \nresponsibility for the replacement lands should be resolved through \nlegislation. They proposed that the Department forgive and cancel Fort \nMcDowell's obligation to repay the mandatory loan in return for the \nTribe's forgiving the Department of the Interior's responsibility to \ndevelop 227 mitigation acres. The Yavapai Nation and the Department \nfurther agree that funds already advanced to the Tribe toward \ndevelopment of the replacement acres would be reprogrammed to fund \nother water development projects on the Yavapai Nation's reservation.\n  The bill introduced today implements the Yavapai Nation's and the \nDepartment's agreement by effectively resolving the replacement land \nmitigation cost for the Department and the loan repayment by the Tribe. \nThis agreement shall constitute completion of all conditions necessary \nto accomplish full and final settlement. Resolution of this last \nremaining issue fully implements the Fort McDowell Indian Community \nWater Rights Settlement Act of 1990. I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2464\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to \nprovide increased assistance for the prevention, treatment, and control \nof tuberculosis, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to introduce the \nBoxer-Smith-Durbin STOP-TB Now Act of 2006. This bill would authorize \nadditional resources to fight tuberculosis, a deadly infectious disease \nthat knows no borders.\n  In January, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, a \nlong-term strategy was developed to cut in half the number of TB cases \nand deaths. This Global Plan to Stop TB estimates that the 10-year cost \nto control tuberculosis is $56 billion, including $47 billion to detect \nand treat TB and $9 billion for additional research and development. If \nthis plan is implemented over the next 10 years, it is estimated that \nit will save the lives of 14 million people throughout the world.\n  Tuberculosis is a deadly disease, especially in the developing world. \nTuberculosis kills nearly 2 million people per year--one person every \n15 seconds. One-third of the world is infected with the germ that \ncauses TB and an estimated 8.8 million individuals will develop active \nTB each year. Tuberculosis is a leading cause of death among women of \nreproductive age and of people who are HIV-positive.\n  While developing nations are most heavily impacted by TB, there is \nalso a concern here at home. It is estimated that 10-15 million people \nin the United States are infected with the germ that causes TB. And, \nCalifornia has more TB cases than any other State in the country. Ten \nof the top twenty U.S. metro areas for TB case rates are in California; \nSan Francisco, San Jose, San Diego, Fresno, Los Angeles, Stockton, \nSacramento, Ventura, Vallejo, and Oakland.\n  This funding is a wise investment for our Nation. A recent article \npublished in the New England Journal of Medicine found that a $35 \nmillion investment in the health system of Mexico to fight TB would \nyield a savings to the U.S. taxpayer of $108 million in terms of \nreduced TB healthcare costs domestically.\n  I have been working with Senator Smith to fight the spread of \ninternational tuberculosis since 1999. I am proud that he has been such \na strong partner on this issue. And, I am grateful for the support of \nSenator Durbin, a champion on the issue of global AIDS and other \ninfectious diseases.\n  The Boxer-Smith-Durbin bill is consistent with the Global Plan to \nStop TB, including the goal to reduce by half the international \ntuberculosis death and disease burden by 2015. It also sets a goal to \ndetect at least 70 percent of cases of infection tuberculosis, and the \ncure of at least 85 percent of the cases detected.\n  The bill authorizes not less than $225 million for fiscal year 2007 \nand not less than $260 million for fiscal year 2008 for foreign \nassistance programs that combat international TB. It also creates a \nseparate authorization of $30 million for the Centers for Disease \nControl to combat international TB.\n  This bill will not only save lives, it will help reverse a troubling \ntrend--the emergence of multi drug-resistant tuberculosis caused by \ninconsistent and incomplete treatment. In the U.S., a standard case of \nTB takes 6 months to cure at the cost of $2,000 per patient. A case of \nmulti drug-resistant TB can take up to 2 years to treat costing as much \nas $1 million per patient.\n  TB kills more people than any other curable disease in the world. I \nhope my colleagues will join us in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 2466. A bill to authorize and direct the exchange and conveyance \nof certain National Forest land and other land in southeast Arizona; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join with Senator \nMcCain to introduce a modified version of S. 1122, the Southeast \nArizona Land Exchange and Conservation Act, which we introduced last \nyear. This modified bill is a culmination of months of negotiation with \nmembers of the climbing community, local and state stakeholders, and \nother interested parties. It is an effort to strengthen the land \nexchange in a way that better meets the needs of outdoor recreation, \nconservation, resource protection, and mining interests.\n  Let me briefly explain the new provisions in this bill. First, you \nmay recall that S. 1122 contained a placeholder for additional climbing \nprovisions. I included this provision in our bill as a good faith offer \nto the climbing community to work with us and the proponent of this \nland exchange, Resolution Copper Company, to address the loss of public \naccess to climbing at Oak Flat in a way that did not compromise public \nsafety. The discussions over the last six months have been fruitful. \nThere will be continued interim use of Oak Flat and some additional \naccess to climbing on Resolution Copper's private land--all subject to \npublic safety requirements.\n  This modified bill goes a step further in addressing the loss of \nrecreation at Oak Flat. S. 1122 required the identification and \ndevelopment of a replacement climbing site. I am pleased to announce \nthat representatives from Resolution Copper, working in cooperation \nwith climbers and federal land managers, have found a climbing gem \nabout 20 miles from Oak Flat, near Hayden and Kearny, Arizona in the \nTam O'Shanter Mountains. ``Tamo,'' as it is now nicknamed, has the \nquality of rock and the elevation and diversity of cliffs, climbing \nwalls, and boulders that rock climbers seek. Couple these \ncharacteristics with Arizona's mild weather and this site has the \npotential to be a four season climbing destination and tourism draw for \nArizona.\n  Recognizing this potential, Arizona State Parks, Resolution Copper, \nand the Bureau of Land Management in cooperation with the communities \nand other mining interests, have been working together on a proposal to \nturn ``Tamo'' into Arizona's newest State park. This proposed State \npark would place a special emphasis on rock climbing, but would also \nhave opportunities for camping and other outdoor recreation. To turn \n``Tamo'' into State park is not an easy task. Currently, Arizona State \nParks lack the legal authority to acquire ``Tamo,'' but it is seeking \nit through the Arizona state legislature. I am pleased to report that a \nState bill containing this authority successfully passed the state \nSenate with overwhelming support from the Sierra Club, Access Fund, and \nASARCO, a mining company operating in the vicinity. The stakeholders \ntell me this issue and others concerning access to the site are close \nto resolution. For this reason, I am including language in this bill \nthat would facilitate a recreation and public purposes conveyance of \n``Tamo'' to Arizona State Parks.\n\n[[Page S2473]]\n\nThis conveyance, of course, would be subject to resolution of these \nissues.\n  Besides addressing climbing and recreation concerns, this modified \nbill does even more for environmental conservation and effective land \nmanagement than the original by adding to the private land package two \nadditional parcels: East Clear Creek and Dripping Springs.\n  The East Clear Creek parcel encompasses 640 acres and is one of the \nlargest single blocks of private inholdings within the Coconino \nNational Forest. The parcel includes two miles of East Clear Creek, \nhence its name, and magnificent canyons that drop as much as 2,000 feet \nin some areas. This unique landscape is a wildlife transition zone \nbetween the upper plateau dominated by ponderosa pine and the riparian \ncorridor of the creek, allowing it to support several threatened and \nsensitive species including bald eagle, peregrine falcon, fish, reptile \nand amphibian species and big game species such as Rocky Mountain elk, \nmule deer, turkey, and black bear. This parcel has been identified and \nis strongly endorsed for public acquisition by the U.S. Forest Service \nand the Trust for Public Lands.\n  The Dripping Springs parcel encompasses 160 acres in the Dripping \nSprings Mountains near Tam O'Shanter Peak in Gila County. This parcel \nhas rock formations with excellent climbing opportunities and is within \nthe contemplated boundaries of the proposed state park.\n  In summary, this land exchange gives us the ability to preserve \nhighly sought-after land, important for wildlife habitat, cultural \nresources, watershed and land-management objectives, to promote outdoor \nrecreation and tourism, and to generate economic opportunities for \nstate and local residents in the copper triangle region in Arizona. It \nis good for our environment and our economy. I urge my colleagues to \napprove the legislation at the earliest possible date.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/28/senate-section/article/S2473-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 407--RECOGNIZING THE AFRICAN AMERICAN SPIRITUAL AS A \n                           NATIONAL TREASURE\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on the Judiciary\n\n                              S. Res. 407\n\n       Whereas, since slavery was introduced into the European \n     colonies in 1619, enslaved Africans remained in bondage until \n     the United States ratified the 13th amendment to the \n     Constitution in 1865;\n       Whereas, during that period of the history of the United \n     States, the first expression of that unique American music \n     was created by enslaved African Americans who--\n       (1) used their knowledge of the English language and the \n     Christian religious faith, as it had been taught to them in \n     the New World; and\n       (2) stealthily wove within the music their experience of \n     coping with human servitude and their strong desire to be \n     free;\n       Whereas, as a method of survival, enslaved African \n     Americans who were forbidden to speak their native languages, \n     play musical instruments they had used in Africa, or practice \n     their traditional religious beliefs, relied on their strong \n     African oral tradition of songs, stories, proverbs, and \n     historical accounts to create this original music, now known \n     as spirituals;\n       Whereas Calvin Earl, a noted performer and educator on \n     African American spirituals, remarked that the Christian \n     lyrics became a metaphor for freedom from slavery, a secret \n     way for slaves to ``communicate with each other, teach their \n     children, record their history, and heal their pain.'';\n       Whereas the New Jersey Historical Commission found that \n     ``some of those daring and artful runaway slaves who entered \n     New Jersey by way of the Underground Railroad no doubt sang \n     the words of old Negro spirituals like `Steal Away' before \n     embarking on their perilous journey north.'';\n       Whereas African American spirituals spread all over the \n     United States, and the songs we know of today may only \n     represent a small portion of the total number of spirituals \n     that once existed;\n       Whereas Frederick Douglass, a fugitive slave who would \n     become one of the leading abolitionists of the United States, \n     remarked that the spirituals ``told a tale of woe which was \n     then altogether beyond my feeble comprehension; they were \n     tones loud, long, and deep; they breathed the prayer and \n     complaint of souls boiling over with the bitterest anguish. \n     Every tone was a testimony against slavery and a prayer to \n     God for deliverance from chains. . . .''; and\n       Whereas the American Folklife Preservation Act (Public Law \n     105-275; 20 U.S.C. 2101 note) finds that ``the diversity \n     inherent in American folklife has contributed greatly to the \n     cultural richness of the nation and has fostered a sense of \n     individuality and identity among the American people.'': Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes that African American spirituals are a \n     poignant and powerful genre of music that have become one of \n     the most significant segments of American music in existence;\n       (2) expresses the deepest gratitude, recognition, and honor \n     to the former enslaved Africans in the United States for \n     their gifts to our Nation, including their original music and \n     oral history; and\n       (3) requests that the President issue a proclamation that \n     reflects on the important contribution of African American \n     spirituals to American history, and naming the African \n     American spiritual a national treasure.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nhonoring the African American Spiritual as a national treasure.

And as I have indicated before, I hope \n     this time the international community will go in for the long \n     haul and not a quick turn-around. We need to work with them \n     to stabilize the country, and sustain the effort. It may take \n     years and I hope we will have the patience to do it.'';\n       Whereas the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti \n     (MINUSTAH) was established by United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 1542 on April 30, 2004, and extended again until \n     August 15, 2006, by United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 1658, ``with the intention to renew for further \n     periods'';\n       Whereas over 40 countries participate in MINUSTAH, \n     including 12 countries from the Western Hemisphere;\n       Whereas the United Nations senior leadership in Haiti is \n     comprised of representatives from Canada, Brazil, and Chile;\n       Whereas more than 3,500,000 Haitians registered to vote in \n     Haiti according to the Organization of American States;\n       Whereas more than 2,000,000 Haitians voted in the national \n     elections on February 7, 2006, according to the Haitian \n     Provisional Electoral Council (CEP); and\n       Whereas more than $1,000,000,000 was pledged at the \n     International Donors Conference in July 2004 in support of \n     Haiti's Interim Cooperation Framework: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) urges reconciliation among the people of Haiti, \n     including a government led by President-elect Rene Preval \n     that respects the rights of all political parties;\n       (2) supports the holding of the second round of \n     parliamentary elections as soon as possible while stressing \n     the importance of a free, fair, and open process;\n       (3) thanks the countries that have contributed personnel to \n     MINUSTAH, particularly Brazil, whose President, Luiz Inacio \n     Lula da Silva, announced on March 13, 2006, that peacekeepers \n     from Brazil will stay in Haiti for as long as the new \n     government in Haiti needs them;\n       (4) strongly encourages MINUSTAH to maintain the current \n     elevated troop levels and to raise significantly the numbers \n     of UNPOL police forces;\n       (5) urges the international community to continue to \n     support MINUSTAH, to fulfill the pledges made at the July \n     2004 International Donors Conference, and to plan for a new \n     multi-year commitment of support at a new donor's conference \n     to be held no later than July 2006;\n       (6) recommends the creation of an effective demobilization, \n     disarmament, and reintegration program to encompass former \n     military members and gangs;\n       (7) recommends that the new government cooperate fully with \n     MINUSTAH in assuring police and judiciary reform; and\n       (8) supports assistance from the United States Government \n     for the reconstruction of Haiti, including programs \n     supporting job creation, governance and rule of law, \n     protection of the environment, social development, and \n     reconstruction of basic infrastructure.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, Haiti's recent election has \nrefocused the eyes of the international community on that country, its \nremarkable successes, and its continuing challenges. We must remind \nourselves that although less than two months ago the Haitian people \nelected Rene Preval as their next President. Haiti's GDP per capita is \n$361, with over 65 percent of the population below the poverty line. \nHalf of all Haitians have no access to clean water, and nearly half \ncannot read or write. In this context the Haitian achievement of an \nelection is even more extraordinary.\n  The international community took notice of Haiti's difficulties and \nits achievements, pledging over a billion dollars in support of Haiti's \nInterim Cooperation Framework in July 2004 at the International Donors \nConference. Some of this money has arrived in Haiti and is benefiting \nthe Haitian people while other pledges remain unfulfilled. We are in a \ncritical time in Haiti; we need to ensure that the promised money \narrives and is used in a way that will improve the lives of all \nHaitians.\n  That's why today I am submitting a Senate resolution along with my \ncolleague, Senator DeWine that highlights Haiti's successes and reminds \nour international partners of their commitments to Haiti and of the \nimportance of promoting stability there. The United Nations \nStabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) is authorized through August \nof this year, and it is critical that this important stability \noperation be continued. Over 40 countries have sent personnel to \nMINUSTAH, including Brazil, whose President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva \nrecently announced that Brazil's peacekeepers will remain in Haiti for \nas long as the new government there needs them.\n  I have just today met with the President-elect of Haiti, Rene Preval. \nIn our meeting I stressed to him the important role he must now play to \nensure that his government respects the rights of all political parties \nand maintains its legitimacy with the Haitian people and the \ninternational community. Mr. Preval has a unique opportunity at this \nhistorical juncture to move Haiti in the right direction. Doing so will \nensure that Haiti attains its proper place within the community of free \nand democratic nations. Only by constantly striving to enhance the \nliberties and opportunities of the average Haitian can Mr. Preval be an \neffective steward of Haiti's dreams.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/28/senate-section/article/S2474-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2474-S2475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 410--DESIGNATING APRIL 2006 AS ``FINANCIAL LITERACY \n                                MONTH''\n\n  Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Lautenberg, \nMr. Kohl, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Talent, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Dodd, \nMr. Martinez, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Inouye, Mr. DeMint, and Mr. \nBaucus) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.
