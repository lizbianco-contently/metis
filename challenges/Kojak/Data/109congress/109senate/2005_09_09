The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today we are resuming consideration of the \nCommerce-Science-Justice appropriations bill. Last night, we reached \nagreement to limit amendments to that bill. That agreement will allow \nus to finish this appropriations bill early next week. We are here \ntoday to give Senators the opportunity to offer amendments from that \nlist. They will also have that opportunity on Monday. We will not vote \non amendments during today's session, but we are prepared to debate \nadditional amendments and schedule those votes for next week.\n  Last night, we scheduled our first vote on Monday, and that will \noccur at 6:30 Monday evening. It will be on the motion to proceed to \nthe resolution of disapproval regarding the regulations relating to \nmercury.\n  As everyone is aware, the Judiciary Committee will begin its hearings \non the nomination of Judge Roberts. I will be working with the \nDemocratic leader to schedule floor votes around those hearings to \nprovide the least amount of disruption of those proceedings. That means \nmost of the voting will occur at the lunch hour or around midday and \nthen later in the evening.\n  Throughout this time, we will continue to focus our efforts on \nlegislation related to the effects of Katrina. Yesterday, as my \ncolleagues know, we acted very quickly on emergency court legislation \nso that those Federal courts could continue operations appropriately. \nAs I have stated again and again, we will remain committed to respond \nand act expeditiously on any matter that can be cleared and that will \nassist in our recovery efforts in those affected States.\n\n[[Page S9866]]\n\n                        Hurricane Relief Efforts\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased to report that last night, the \nSenate moved very quickly and passed a supplemental emergency aid \npackage, a $51.8 billion bill that was signed and then about 2 hours \nlater was signed by the President of the United States. It is a bill \nthat aims directly at the critical rescue and relief efforts of the \nvictims of Hurricane Katrina. Last night's action reflects the solemn \ncommitment of the Congress and the President to the people devastated \nby the extreme disaster which has struck the Gulf Coast. I thank my \ncolleagues for their hard work and determination to get this bill \npassed expeditiously. The clock was ticking.\n  As of yesterday, the $10.5 billion we allocated during last \nThursday's urgent session was nearly tabbed out. We knew at the time we \npassed this initial funding that more aid would be needed. What we did \nnot know was the sheer magnitude of the catastrophe and how it would \noutstrip those relief dollars so quickly.\n  By pulling together and responding in an efficient and quick manner, \nfocusing on that essential task, at 7:30 last night we did pass that \n$51.8 billion bill. As a result of that, thousands of volunteers and \nresponders will continue to do what they are doing so well right now \nalong the Gulf Coast, and that is saving lives and providing aid. As I \nspeak, over 65,000 Active-Duty and National Guard personnel are in the \nGulf region conducting search, rescue, and voluntary evacuation \noperations. They are helping to restore washed-out roads, build \nbridges, and clear millions of gallons of toxic floodwater. They are \nproviding critical health care, medical care, food, water, shelter, and \nsecurity. Our thanks go out to them. Our gratitude goes out to each and \nevery one of them. Many of those rescue workers, in fact, are putting \ntheir lives on the line as they deal day in and day out with an \nenvironment of destruction, of toxic chemicals, of toxic waters. We \nthank them for their dedication.\n  When I was in New Orleans last Saturday and Sunday, just outside the \nterminal of the New Orleans airport, I had the opportunity to meet face \nto face with so many wonderful guard units. The 118th Airlift Wing, the \nTennessee Guard based out of Nashville, was there in force. The 118th \nhad been ferrying supplies and people in and out of that region over \nthe course of the week, around the clock for days. Right now, the 118th \nAeroMed units are transporting the sick and the injured evacuees to \nlocations all around the country. Again, I thank them in particular \nbecause they are from my home region of middle Tennessee, but I thank \nall of those Guard units and Active military that are contributing with \nuntiring dedication and commitment.\n  FEMA continues to aggressively provide support and sustenance for the \nhundreds of thousands of families whose lives have simply been \nshattered by this disaster. In 1 week, over a quarter of a million \npeople have been evacuated and placed in over 200 shelters across 17 \nStates. Each one of those shelters has affiliated with it many \nshelters, but it gives some feeling of the magnitude that there are \nsome formal shelters in 17 States.\n  Countless citizens all across the country are pitching in and giving \nmoney and donating their services and giving hope to those displaced \nindividuals and families. Huge efforts are underway to locate those \nmissing persons, people who have been separated from their friends and \nfrom their families. From the very beginning, we have seen a great \noutpouring of the American spirit, compassion, and care from private \ncitizens, church groups, college groups, doctors, nurses, grandparents, \nmoms, and dads--all being on the front lines helping neighbors in \ndistress.\n\n  Several of my colleagues have heard me tell the story of last \nSaturday and Sunday at the New Orleans airport where triage was \nunderway, thousands of people were being brought in the door of that \nterminal. One out of four had some special need, some health care need, \nsome medical emergency. To see the operation of four college students \nfrom the University of Texas helping carry people up to the triage unit \nside by side with our Guard units maintaining security the best they \npossibly could, coupled with the DMAT units, disaster medical \nassistance units, that have come from Florida, Pennsylvania, and really \nfrom all over the country--it was an amazing outpouring of people \nworking together under the most trying circumstances, circumstances \nthat minute by minute got worse and worse and worse. But everybody was \npulling together, helping people in distress.\n  A vivid image I think of throughout the day is two people on \nstretchers side by side on the floor in that very dark terminal in the \nmidst of all that chaos in so many ways with so many people coming in, \nand those two people not knowing each other but taking care of each \nother's needs, helping each get a little bit of water, a little bit of \nfood, or stopping somebody, the assistance one patient would give \nanother patient, somebody they had never seen before. Again, there was \nthis outpouring of compassion, love, and volunteer spirit.\n  Today in the private sector, individuals and businesses have \nspontaneously donated well over $300 million to this effort. It is \ngrowing by hundreds of thousands of dollars every day--again, a \nrepresentation of the outpouring of generosity, concern from \nindividuals, corporations, and businesses. It is this outpouring of \ncompassion and support that is a testament to our national character, \nthe character of being an American.\n  Here in the Senate, we have worked around the clock, as people have \nseen, with the emergency session last Thursday, and it continues today. \nWe convened the emergency session Thursday and passed an emergency \nsupplemental of $10.5 billion, and then the $51.8 billion last night. \nThe committee chairmen have all been charged and are working very hard \ncrafting legislation to meet the urgent and long-term needs of the \nhurricane survivors.\n  This week, Speaker Hastert and I announced the formation of a \nbicameral--that is, House and Senate--bipartisan committee to conduct a \ntop-to-bottom investigation, analysis, review of the emergency \npreparation and response to Hurricane Katrina. The committee will be \nmade up of senior Members. It will report back to this body no later \nthan February 15. They are going to review the emergency plans that \nwere in place at the local level, at the State level, and at the \nFederal level, and how they interacted with each other, what went wrong \nand what went right. They will assess how local, State, and Federal \ngovernments actually responded, and when things went wrong, we will \nfind it and we will correct it as we prepare for the future. Our \ncommittees will have legislative authority and will work with that \njoint committee based on those findings to legislate accordingly.\n  The Energy Committee this week held hearings on the surge in gas \nprices and what can be done to bring them down. We passed legislation \nto get the Federal court system in the affected areas up and running.\n  There are a lot of moving parts. We will continue to focus on \nlegislation that answers the immediate response and relief, moving \nother business aside. Thousands of people need our help, and the three \nStates need to recover and rebuild.\n  Yes, all of this is a massive undertaking. It is an undertaking that \nis going to force us to think out of the box, to think innovatively, to \nthink creatively, to think in ways that we just simply have not thought \nbefore. In many ways it is inexcusable to have a response which is not \nseamless, which is not efficient, which is not focused on seamless \ncommunication. We are going to fix what is broken and we are going to \ndo it aggressively, thinking creatively, innovatively, and out of the \nbox.\n\n  As the Senate moves forward, helping the victims of the hurricane is \nour No. 1 priority. We are working through essentially three phases. \nAnd when I say phases, I think chronologically, but it is simultaneous \nphases. First is that immediate response to the victims who are in \nneed, to the displaced persons, to continue that search and rescue. \nWhatever it takes, this body will make that an ongoing priority.\n  The second element is the longer term rebuilding and reconstruction \nand revitalization of that entire Gulf State region. That is a major \nfocus. It is a focus that has already begun, but it is also a much \nlonger focus. It will take weeks and months and years. And that focus \nis something that needs to be a part of our agenda, is a part of our\n\n[[Page S9867]]\n\nagenda, and each of our committees is looking at that.\n  The third element is an analysis of what went wrong and what went \nright. We will be doing that through our committee structure as well as \nthe joint committee that has been established by the Speaker and me.\n  We need to cut the redtape and bureaucracy that is getting in the \nway. We hear it again and again and again. I have asked each of the \ncommittee chairmen to expedite proposals, suggestions to leadership, so \nwe can consider those in this Chamber.\n  In closing, the Senate and the American people are committed to \nhelping the Gulf Coast rise again in a bigger way, a better way, and a \nmore prosperous way than ever. It will require us to think innovatively \nand creatively. In this hour of need, in this hour of tragedy and \nunrest, we can also find great opportunity and great reason for hope. \nWe stand shoulder to shoulder with our neighbors from the Gulf today, \ntomorrow, and in the months ahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to return to the \nconsideration of H.R. 2826, the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related \nAgencies Appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2006. \nI thought we had a very productive opening day yesterday. We heard from \nmany of our colleagues. We will continue to do that. We have several \namendments that we are in the process of reviewing on both sides of the \naisle here, and we are doing our best to consider the views and \nconcerns of all Members.\n  Again, I would like to reiterate this morning how important it is \nthat Members let me and Senator Mikulski and our staffs know of any \namendments they plan to offer. I urge those Senators with amendments to \ncome to the floor. This is a very important bill. This funds a lot of \nvery important agencies, and the quicker we can realize what we have to \ndo and how we are going to go about it, the better off we are and we \nwill expedite this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                       Honoring Our Armed Forces\n\n                     Lance Corporal Kevin S. Smith\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise this morning to honor a fellow \nOhioan, a young man from Springfield. Twenty-year-old LCPL Kevin S. \nSmith was killed on March 21, 2005, when a suicide bomber detonated an \nexplosive-filled car against Smith's Humvee. Lance Corporal Smith was \nconducting stabilization operations in Al Anbar Province, protecting \nIraqi civilians he had been among for less than a month.\n  Kevin Smith had a profound sense of duty. Before he had even \ngraduated from high school, he knew he wanted to be a marine. At a very \nyoung age he had the resolve to defend his country abroad, and as Kevin \ngrew he developed the thoroughness, the competence, and the compassion \nthat helped him serve with distinction.\n  Kevin Smith was born on September 24, 1984, in Springfield to proud \nparents Ronald and Kathy Smith. Growing up, Kevin enjoyed baseball and \nplaying his guitar. He attended Kenton Ridge High School where he was a \nmember of the Spanish National Honor Society. Marsha Stoner, head of \nthe society, taught Kevin for 3 years. She recalls immediately noticing \nhim in her class, and at the ceremony in Kevin's honor described her \nformer student as ``genuine, kind, and gentle.''\n  Principal Chuck Foss remembers Smith as the kind of person who ``just \ndid things the way they were supposed to be done.'' He continues: ``I \nwould take a whole school of kids like him.''\n  Indeed, our whole country could use more men such as Kevin Smith.\n  School was not the only place Kevin showed his reliability and \npersonal strength. As those who own older cars know well, sometimes \nyour own automobile becomes your greatest challenge. Kevin owned a \ndecaying 1993 Toyota Celica that he lovingly named ``Doughnut.''\n  With spare parts and elbow grease, Kevin kept the Celica in working \ncondition long after this ``doughnut'' should have sputtered its last \nsputter.\n  Kevin had the drive it took to keep that aging car running. He saw a \njob that needed doing, and made sure it got done right. Also, while \nworking on the car, Kevin developed the ingenuity he would later apply \nin the Marines. Lance Corporal Smith could disassemble a medium machine \ngun--twice--in a minute and forty-eight seconds.\n  Kevin met his fiancee, Kristi Leider, at Kenton Ridge. They planned \nto marry. Kevin looked forward to becoming a husband and becoming a \npoliceman so he could protect his family and his community. But first, \nthere was something he had to do. He had to protect his Nation as a \nMarine.\n  After graduating from Kenton Ridge in 2003, Kevin departed to serve. \nIn Iraq, he was a member of the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment, \nknown to marines as the three-two. Kevin Smith was a natural leader, \nalways the last to bed after checking on every member of his team. \nSergeant Clive S. Chinatomby, Kevin's squad leader, had the following \nto say about Lance Corporal Smith:\n\n       He was a team leader and was the first one to jump up and \n     volunteer for anything. Anytime I'd go to him with something, \n     it would get done.\n\n  Kevin Smith would get it done--and he would get it done right.\n  Lance Corporal Smith was more than just able and dedicated. He was \ncompassionate. Smith would joke with his team, telling them clever one-\nliners as they patrolled. He not only did his best to protect the \nMarines around him from the physical perils of war, he shielded them \nfrom the stress and tension of being under constant threat. At a \nmemorial service following Kevin's death, Sergeant Chinatomby attested \nto Kevin's infectious good humor:\n\n       He kept me on my toes. Everything in life had a smart \n     comment. He always had a come back for you, and he taught me \n     not to take life that [seriously], because there is always a \n     lighter side to things. He made situations a lot less \n     stressful.\n\n  Tragically, on March 21, 2005, Kevin's squad lost a friend, his \nparents lost a son, and the United States lost a brave and dedicated \nMarine.\n  Kevin's Company First Sergeant, J.W. Rovnak wrote this message to the \nSmith family as a tribute to the kindness and service Kevin gave the \nmen of the three-two:\n\n       It is difficult to express the loss the men and I share \n     here in Iraq. We bite back tears and mourn quietly in dark \n     corners as we focus on the task at hand. We live for the day \n     that we can grieve with you and try to give back to you all \n     that Kevin has blessed us with. He lives in us, and our lives \n     are forever touched and changed because of him. I am honored \n     to have known him. Semper Fi.\n\n  Nathan Heironimus, Kevin's childhood friend, remember his kindness, \ngood humor, and dedication. He wrote Kevin the following message in \ntribute:\n\n       Kevin--We had some good times these past fifteen years or \n     so--playing backyard sports and videogames as kids, [playing] \n     music, and cruising around in [old doughnut]. It seems like \n     we did it all. You'll always be remembered by me as an easy-\n     going comedian who just knew how to take it easy and enjoy \n     life to the fullest. Easy to talk to and determined, I know \n     you were a great leader for your team like you always were. \n     We're all proud of what you've done for our country!! I know \n     you're up there smiling down on us all now.\n\n  Kevin was as good a soldier as this country could ask for. He got the \njob done, he was trusted and loved by his fellow Marines, and he was \ndedicated to the protection of democracy--be it abroad or at home.\n  Lance Corporal Smith offered us his blood, sweat, and tears. He left \nan indelible mark on this world. He will never be forgotten. His family \nand friends honor the sacrifice he made, the Marines of the three-two \nhonor the sacrifice he made, and today, I honor that sacrifice.\n  My wife, Fran, and I continue to keep Kevin's fiancee, his parents, \nand his sister in our thoughts and in our prayers.\n\n\n                      SERGEANT MICHAEL FINKE, JR.\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Marine Sergeant Michael \nFinke, Jr, who was one of 31 servicemembers killed when their \nhelicopter crashed near Rutba, Iraq, on January 26, 2005. After \nsecuring Fallujah for the\n\n[[Page S9868]]\n\nupcoming elections, 28 year-old Michael and his unit were being \ntransported north for another security mission.\n  Born in Scottsdale, AZ, on October 31, 1976, Michael moved to Medina, \nOH, when he was 6. Michael was a quiet boy--polite and considerate. His \nfather, Michael Sr., remembers his son ``[making] friends everywhere he \nwent. He was a practical joker. He didn't smile very much, but boy, \nwhen he did--when he laughed--everybody knew they should be doing it, \ntoo.''\n  Michael always dreamed of becoming a Marine. His mother, Sally Rapp, \nremembers that ever ``since [Michael] was a little guy, he always \ntalked about being a Marine.'' He not only talked about it, he tried to \ndo something about it. When Michael was 15, he sent the Marines a \npostcard, lying about his age and informing them he would like to \nenlist. When this attempt failed, Michael tried again the following \nyear. This time he received a letter in return, telling him to get into \nshape. When he turned 17, Michael was finally able to realize his dream \nof being one of the few and the proud. With the signed consent of his \nfather, he enlisted in the United States Marines Corps.\n  Before he became a Marine, Michael was a student at Medina High \nSchool and then at Huron High School. Michael played football and \nbaseball. He was the catcher on the 1995 Huron high school baseball \nteam that won the Sandusky Bay Conference Championship. It was the \nfirst time Huron had won the conference since 1987. Michael's coaches \nremember him as a nice young man and a team player. One of his baseball \ncoaches, Don Wood, said that Michael was ``a kid [who] worked hard and \ndid his best every day he came out.''\n  Michael also sang in a mixed choir during his senior year of high \nschool. His choral director remembers Michael as `` . . . a quiet guy, \neven in choir. He was a good student for me. The quiet ones tend to be \ngood students.''\n  While Michael enjoyed the benefits of high school life--playing on a \nchampionship baseball team, singing in the choir, hanging out with his \nfriends--he was very much looking forward to life as a Marine. You see, \nMichael came from an honorable line of military men. His grandfather \nwas a Marine and his father was a member of the 101st Airborne, serving \nas a helicopter door gunner during the Vietnam War--service for which \nhe earned the Bronze Star.\n  With such a military tradition in his family, it is easy to see why \nMichael was so interested in becoming a Marine. Long after he had \njoined the service, Michael's mother found an old briefcase that \nMichael had used to store his Marines memorabilia. It was stuffed with \nbrochures and information packets. As his mother says, ``I think he \nspent half his life at that recruiting office!''\n  Michael's younger brother, Tim, was always skeptical of Michael's \ndesire to become a Marine. But, when Michael came home wearing his \ndress uniform for the first time, Tim was convinced that it was the \nright thing. He said: ``[Michael] was only 5 foot 6 inches tall, but \n[in that uniform] he looked 8 feet tall. He was bigger than life. I \nunderstood why he wanted to be a Marine.''\n  Indeed, the Marine uniform--representing bravery, sacrifice, and \nhonor--was a perfect fit for Michael Finke.\n  After boot camp, Michael was assigned to Camp Pendleton, California. \nIt was there that he met his soul mate, Heather Dohrman. The two \nmarried on October 11, 2002, in Las Vegas. Because of Michael's duty \nassignments and Heather's education commitments, the two were only able \nto spend a limited amount of time together. But they made every moment \ncount. They were deeply in love and had planned to start a family once \nMichael returned from Iraq.\n  Michael almost wasn't deployed to Iraq. He was serving on the USS \nEssex and when the roster of Marines aboard who were being deployed to \nIraq was posted, and--to his dismay--Michael's name was not on the \nlist. He lobbied his superiors, begging to go with his men--his friends \nhis brothers. Upon hearing that her son was actively seeking a tour in \nIraq, his mother asked Michael, ``Are you crazy?!'' His response rings \ntrue to the core beliefs of all Marines. ``That's my family,'' Michael \nsaid. ``I have to be with my family.''\n  Michael found Iraq to be a dangerous, yet inspiring place. He was \nprivy to the daily death and destruction that defined the city of \nFallujah, as he and his unit helped to provide security for the city. \nBut, he was also deeply involved with the children of Iraq. According \nto his grandmother, Donna Thompson, ``[Michael] said the kids were \nabsolutely wonderful children. He just adored them.'' He also told his \nmother, Sally: ``Mom, I just love the kids, I just look in their eyes, \nand I know the future of Iraq is in the children.'' Michael truly \nbelieved in his mission--that he was helping protect the freedom and \nfutures of Iraqis, as well as Americans through his service.\n\n  Michael Finke was a great Marine. Sergeant Major Ramona Cook recalls \nserving with Michael. In an email posted to an Internet tribute to \nMichael, she wrote:\n\n       The news of Sergeant Finke's death was numbing, and it \n     hurt. I had the pleasure of serving with Sergeant Finke as \n     his 1st Sergeant at Camp Pendleton. His caring attitude and \n     calm demeanor set him apart, and he was truly a leader of \n     Marines. I hope his family finds some solace in knowing that \n     Michael died a hero, and will forever be remembered and \n     missed.\n\n  Michael Finke, Jr., was an exceptional human being, who was loved by \nhis wife, his family, his friends, his fellow Marines, the children of \nIraq, and anyone else who came into contact with him. He was a living, \nbreathing exemplar of the Marine Corps' values: honor, courage, \ncommitment. Michael grew up desperately wanting to become a Marine and \nupon achieving that goal, he served with dedication and distinction.\n  One of the people Michael admired was General George S. Patton. In \nregard to how we honor our fallen servicemen and women General Patton \nonce said this:\n\n       It is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died. Rather, \n     we should thank God that such men lived.\n\n  We are indeed thankful to God that Michael Finke, Jr., lived. He was \na good person--a loving, selfless, passionate man. This earth is a \nbetter place because of him and because he lived.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep Michael and his wife, parents, \nand siblings in our thoughts and prayers.\n\n\n                        Corporal Timothy Knight\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today on the floor of the Senate to honor the \nlife of 22-year-old Marine Corporal Timothy Knight. On January 26, \n2005, Timothy, from Brooklyn, OH, and 30 fellow servicemembers were \nkilled when the helicopter they were riding in crashed near Rutba, \nIraq. Timothy, or ``Timmy'' to those who know him, was a member of the \n1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment, 3rd Marine Division.\n  Timmy's mother, Jeannie, remembers her son growing up as a ``normal \nBrooklyn kid.'' He was interested in sports and the outdoors. He was \noutgoing and likable--respectful and easy-going. Timmy was well-liked \nin the community and at school.\n  He attended Brooklyn High School, where he played football and ran \ntrack. Teachers from Brooklyn remember him as a good student, who was \nalways roaming the hallways with a confident gait--a confidence that \ncame from knowing he would someday become a U.S. Marine.\n  That is what he wanted to do. Ever since he was eight years-old, \nTimmy knew he wanted to serve in the Marine Corps. He was fascinated by \nthe discipline and the sharp uniforms. And, after watching war movies \nwith his father, he would spend hours dreaming of the heroic adventures \nhe would eventually embark upon.\n  Before joining the Marines, however, Timmy pursued another career \ninterest--and that was law enforcement. He decided to attend the \nPolaris Career Center while in high school and take law enforcement \nclasses. Upon completion of his service in the Marines, Timmy hoped to \nbecome a State Trooper or a U.S. Marshall. He came one step closer to \nthis goal when he graduated from Brooklyn High School and Polaris \nCareer Center in May 2001.\n  Going all the way back to the 3rd Grade, Timmy had his eye on yet \nanother goal--someday marrying a girl named Gina Delligatti. Now, this \ntook a few years of convincing on Timmy's part. Let's just say that the \ntwo didn't\n\n[[Page S9869]]\n\nget off on the right foot. According to Gina, Timmy was constantly \nteasing her. This ``teasing'' continued from grade school into high \nschool, when Timmy was no longer interested in making fun of Gina, but \nrather just interested in her. This teasing-turned-flirting eventually \ncaught Gina's attention, and she remembers Timmy, little by little, \n``growing on [her].''\n  The 8th of May 2000 was a serendipitous day for Timothy Knight. He \nwas mourning for his beloved dog, which had just passed away. Gina came \nover to console him and seeing how upset he was, tried to lift his \nspirits. She agreed to start dating Timmy. After nearly a decade of \nteasing and flirting, Timmy and Gina finally became a couple. And, they \nnever once looked back.\n  Timmy and Gina were two people made for each other. Their senior \nclass voted them ``Most Popular Couple.'' Two years after graduating, \nin November 2003, Timmy and Gina were married. Those attending the \nceremony may have noticed that Gina was not wearing any shoes. The \nreason was that Timmy was about 5 foot 6, and Gina was a little bit \ntaller. Timmy, in fact, frequently used the nickname ``Big Bird'' when \nreferring to Gina. So, in deference to Timmy not wanting to ``look \nreally short'' next to a high-heeled bride, Gina went shoeless for the \nceremony.\n  Such compromises were common for Timmy and Gina. She remembers Timmy \nas her best friend. She said that ``he was a great husband, who cleaned \nthe car every Sunday and cooked. He really only cooked two dishes that \nI had taught him, but he cooked! Not everyone can say that about their \nhusband!''\n  When people who knew Timmy describe him, the first thing that usually \ncomes to mind is his sense of humor. His mother remembers his laughter \nand ability to make people feel at ease. Gina remembers Timmy being \nsomething of the ``class clown'' in high school. And, from what she has \nheard from the other Marines in Timmy's unit, he could always be \ncounted on to lighten the mood when things got bad. Gina and others \nremember Timmy's smile:\n\n       It was a grin that made you laugh. And, you laughed despite \n     him having done something to make you mad. So, even though \n     you wanted to wring his neck, you grinned back at him, \n     because you had to. He just had that way about him.\n\n  While Timmy was deployed in Iraq, Gina gave birth to a daughter named \nChloe. Timmy never got to meet his daughter, but Gina believes he would \nhave been a fantastic father. I have no doubt that would be the case.\n  Timothy Knight's life was cut tragically short on that January day \nwhen his helicopter went down. Thirty-one sets of parents lost their \nchildren on that fateful day. One parent, Sally Rapp from Westlake, OH, \nand the mother of Army Sergeant Michael Finke, understands the pain \nthat Timmy's mother Jeannie experienced when her son was killed. She, \ntoo, lost her son that day. Sally wrote the following wrote in an email \nmessage posted on an Internet tribute after Timmy's death:\n\n       My son, Sergeant Michael Finke, was on the helicopter with \n     Tim. My condolences to the family, as I share in the pain of \n     losing one so loved. We are forever united through the \n     sacrifices that our young men were willing to make. Thank you \n     and God Bless.\n\n  While there are no words that can ever ease the pain of losing a \nchild, we may take solace in knowing that both Timothy Knight and \nMichael Finke made use of every moment they lived. As Adlai Stevenson \nonce said, ``It is not the years in your life, but the life in your \nyears that counts.''\n  Indeed, Timothy Knight lived a lot of life in those 22 short years. \nTimothy Knight lived his life to its fullest as an easy-going kid from \nBrooklyn, OH, who loved his wife, his family, and his new daughter, \nChloe. We honor him today on the floor of the U.S. Senate, because he \nput his love for his country, his love for our freedom and the freedom \nof others, first--above all else. He gave his life in the hope that \nChloe's generation would see a safer, more stable world.\n  We will always honor his life and never forget his sacrifice.\n\n\n                    PRIVATE FIRST CLASS JASON SPARKS\n\n  Mr. President, on September 16, 2004, more than 1,000 people gathered \nin the Monroeville, OH, high school gymnasium to say goodbye to one of \ntheir own--Army Private First Class Jason Sparks, who died while \nbravely serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Those who gathered could \nnot help but think that this brave young man was very much alive just \n14 months ago in that same gymnasium--receiving his high school \ndiploma.\n  Members of the high school football team, clad in their black and \ngold uniforms, escorted the body of 19-year-old Jason out of the high \nschool for the last time.\n  Jason Sparks was a well-adjusted young man, who could make anyone \nsmile. In his all-too-brief 19 years on this earth, he made a lasting \nimpression on all those who knew him.\n  Jason was born to loving parents--Scott and Lisa Sparks. Even as a \nyoung boy, Jason was outgoing. His dad remembers his young son as a \n``child who loved everyone he came into contact with'' and who ``didn't \nhave a shy bone in his body.'' He remembers Jason asking him for hugs \nby saying, ``Big hug! Big hug!''\n  At Monroeville High School, classmates and teachers remember Jason as \nthe outgoing kid who was always smiling. Not only did students love to \nbe around him, so did the teachers. Principal, David Stubblebine, \ndescribes Jason as ``the kind of kid who would walk into the office, \nplop down, and say, `How ya' doing?' '' Janet Gerber, a counselor at \nthe school, remembered Jason as honest and straightforward--and always \nhelpful around the office.\n  Jason was also very athletic. He pitched and played first base on the \nbaseball team and played special teams, tackle, and guard on the \nfootball team. Ben Paul, the school's athletic director, remembers \nJason as ``the kind of athlete who put team goals ahead of individual \ngoals. He was an integral part of that team's success. He was a hard-\nworking kid and a good athlete.''\n  Outside of school, Jason loved playing on his Xbox video game system \nand hanging out with friends. He also worked at two fast food \nrestaurants in nearby Norwalk, OH. It was there that he met the love of \nhis life, Jennifer Smith.\n  Jennifer remembers meeting Jason while the two worked together. In \nthe beginning, she wasn't interested, but Jason persisted and the two \nbecame friends. The friendship slowly evolved into something more and \nJason eventually proposed and they got engaged.\n  After graduating from high school in 2003, Jason was looking for a \nway to prepare for college and, eventually, dentistry school. He \ndecided to join the Army, as did his fiance Jennifer. Jason trained \nwith the 1st Battalion, 503rd Infantry, 2nd Infantry Division at Camp \nCasey, Korea, before heading to Kuwait. While there, the military \nnewspaper, Stars and Stripes, asked him how soldiers deal with training \nin the intense Kuwaiti heat. Jason replied that after South Korea, it \ndidn't bother him too much, and he would advise drinking a lot of \nwater. Jason excitedly called his family to tell them that he was \nfeatured in the article.\n  Jason made sure to call his family often--especially his 6-year-old \nsister, Sarah. Scott Sparks noted that despite their age difference, \nJason and Sarah were very close. His mom Lisa loved to hear from her \nson, whom she called, ``a hugger, not a fighter.''\n  In early September 2004, Jason was sent to Iraq, and tragically--less \nthan a week after his arrival--he was killed when insurgents fired on \nhis patrol.\n  In an email posted on an Internet tribute following Jason's death, \nfellow soldier Private First Class Anthony P. Herber of Norwalk, OH--\nwho, at the time of writing his message was stationed in Mosul, Iraq--\nwrote the following:\n\n       Jason--you were my best friend, and I will never forget \n     that you are the reason that I am still here today. You were \n     a caring person, and nobody will ever forget that. I miss you \n     man, and as I sit here in Iraq, I just hope I can be the hero \n     you are to all of us.\n\n  The tight-knit community in Monroeville also deeply felt Jason's \nloss. The flag hung at half-staff at the high school, and those \ngathered for the football game on a September night heard a tribute to \ntheir fallen classmate. Dick Winslow, commander of American Legion Post \n547 in Monroeville said that ``Jason sacrificed his life in Iraq for \nthe cause of freedom. Jason rubbed shoulders with us. He was one of \nus.''\n  On September 16, 2004, hundreds of mourners lined the funeral \nprocession\n\n[[Page S9870]]\n\nroute to show their support for the Sparks family. In response to this \noutpouring, Scott Sparks remarked that ``[Jason] touched a lot more \npeople's lives than we ever knew.''\n  Indeed, Jason Sparks touched countless lives around the world through \nhis service to America and his support of the Iraqi people. I'd like to \nconclude my remarks with the heartfelt words of Deanna Morgan Mack, a \nfriend of Jason's from Monroeville on whom Jason had a strong, lasting \nimpact. Deanna wrote the following:\n\n       Jason . . . you were such an amazing friend. . . . I do not \n     know of anyone who didn't love you. I'll never forget the \n     times seeing you at church or at the high school. . . . I \n     know that we never really talked that much but whenever I'd \n     see that smile of yours that could brighten up a room, I \n     couldn't help it and had to smile, too.\n       I'll never forget when [my brother] was sick one day and \n     mom sent me in to get his Homework and I saw you standing \n     there. I was in the worst mood possible and had tears running \n     down my face. You bent down so we were eye to eye, and as you \n     wiped the tears away with that million watt smile, you asked \n     me what was wrong and if there was anything that would make \n     it better. I was between the ages of 10 and 11 and as a \n     little kid the only thing I thought would make it better was \n     an ice cream. I told you that, and you said, ``Well I don't \n     know if I can give you that, but I can tell you this--\n     whatever your problem, God will help you solve it.'' And \n     then, you just smiled again as you eased your way upwards. I \n     thought about your words, and it wasn't until a couple years \n     ago that I actually understood what they meant. But, I'll \n     always remember how I walked out of that office with the \n     biggest grin on my face. Thank you for being like an older \n     brother to me, Jason. I'll always look up to you in Heaven \n     above. And, when I have a problem, I think that before I ask \n     God, I'll ask you, and I'll picture that smile and know that \n     everything will be okay again. I love you and miss you with \n     all my heart Jason Lee Sparks. May God rest your soul.\n\n\n                        Specialist Gavin Colburn\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor a fellow Ohioan and brave \nsoldier. Army SPC Gavin Colburn, from Frankfort, served with the 542nd \nTransportation Company in Iraq. Specialist Colburn lost his life on \nApril 22, 2005, when a roadside bomb detonated alongside his convoy. He \nwas 20 years old.\n  Gavin Colburn sacrificed his life for the safety of the American \npeople, the survival of a new Iraqi freedom, and for the men and women \nserving alongside him. He continued to give of himself even during the \nlast moments of his life. When the roadside bomb exploded near his \nvehicle, Specialist Colburn threw his body over fellow soldier Michelle \nPfister, shielding her from the blast. Specialist Colburn had promised \nMichelle's father that he would watch out for her. He kept his promise.\n  Gavin was born on January 24, 1985, in Washington Court House, OH. He \nattended Adena High School in Frankfort, where he was a member of the \nbasketball and track teams. His basketball coach, Mike Patrick, \ndescribed him as a ``consummate teammate,'' with a great physical \nenergy--a sentiment shared by Gavin's close friend, Andrew West. ``We'd \nall complain that we had to run so far,'' said West. ``Gavin never \ncomplained.'' Whether as a member of the track team or as a member of \nan Army company, Gavin was the ultimate teammate.\n  In eighth grade, Gavin befriended Andrew. Gavin treated Andrew, who \nwas younger, like a brother, teaching him the simple truths that help \nboys become good men. Andrew remembers Gavin as endlessly patient and \nmisses the time they spent together wandering their neighborhood, \nplaying football and basketball.\n  After high school, Gavin met Sarah Kern while working at McDonalds. \nGavin was so taken with Sarah that he worked up the courage to hand her \nhis phone number--right in front of her mother. They spent more and \nmore time together, and eventually made plans to marry as soon as Gavin \nleft the service.\n  Gavin looked forward to his life with Sarah and wanted to provide for \nhis future family. He joined the Army Reserves in 2003 to help pay for \na college education and eventually a law degree. Tony Colburn, Gavin's \nfather, offered to pay his son's tuition--an offer that Gavin refused. \nHe wanted to do it himself. He didn't want to burden his family. This \ndecision was yet another example of Gavin Colburn's willingness to \nsacrifice for the sake of others--a creed that defined his all too \nbrief life.\n  In the service, Gavin quickly impressed his superiors with his \nbravery and quiet competence. Brigadier General Michael Beasley \nremembers him as the ``go to guy'' of the 542nd. Colburn quickly rose \nto the rank of Specialist. ``He would have been a Sergeant in a matter \nof months,'' said General Beasley. In the Army, Gavin conducted himself \nwith the same sacrifice and dedication coach Patrick recognized years \nbefore. Indeed, Gavin was a ``consummate teammate.''\n  Specialist Colburn posthumously received a Purple Heart and Bronze \nStar for saving the life of his fellow soldier. Though ribbons and \nmedals do not define his service, they are a fitting honor for a young \nman who gave his life so that another might live.\n  Gavin would have liked to know that his friends and loved ones--his \nneighbors and teachers--understand why he gave his life and are \ngrateful for his service to them, to Frankfort, to our Nation. In a \nwritten memorial created by Gavin's friends, those who knew him well \nremember his sacrifice. Michelle Pfister, the soldier whose life he \nsaved, wrote this:\n\n       Gavin was a very special person to me. I was in the truck \n     with him on that night, and if he [had not] used his life to \n     save mine, I would not be here today. Gavin--I love you and \n     miss you so much. Thank you so much for keeping your promise \n     to my family. You will always be my big brother.\n\n  Gavin left an indelible mark on this world, in the lives he protected \nand the friends he inspired. Andrew, his friend from childhood, wrote \nhim the following message:\n\n       I will think about you daily and the sacrifices you made \n     not only for your country, but the ones you made for your \n     hometown, for your friends, and fiance and your parents. \n     We'll miss you buddy.\n\n  In May, Andrew carried on Gavin's mission to protect by enlisting in \nthe U.S. Army. It is through acts like these that the memory of Gavin \nColburn lives on.\n  We must remember the honor he earned, but it is equally important to \nremember the life Gavin lived--how he spent his time, how he treated \nothers. Gavin's cousin, Stacey, wrote this to him:\n\n       Gavin, there [are] not any words to describe how proud I am \n     of you. You have always been great at everything you have \n     done in your lifetime. You will always be my little cousin, \n     and I will always remember you and all of our memories we had \n     while growing up. We will never forget you. I love you, and \n     hope to see you again one day in Heaven but until then, [rest \n     in peace] my hero.\n\n  Gavin Colburn lived bravely, selflessly, and with tireless energy. He \nheld nothing back from his community, or from his mission to protect \nfreedom. Gavin has inspired greatness in so many others. His friends, \nhis family, and his Nation are proud of his service, and we owe him our \neternal gratitude.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep Gavin's family in our thoughts \nand in our prayers.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Sergeant Darrin Keith Potter\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask the Senate to pause for a moment \ntoday in loving memory and honor of Sergeant Darrin Keith Potter.\n  Sergeant Potter of Louisville, KY, served with the 223rd Military \nPolice Company in the Kentucky Army National Guard. On September 29, \n2003, he gave his life in defense of our country in the vicinity of \nBaghdad, Iraq.\n  On that day in September, nearly 2 years ago, Sergeant Potter and two \nof his fellow soldiers were responding to reports of lethal bombing \nattacks by terrorists near a prison facility. His MP team tried to \ndrive around a tight corner in a Humvee, but overturned into a canal.\n  Although his teammates escaped the vehicle safely, sadly, Sergeant \nPotter did not, and drowned. He had faithfully served his nation as a \ncitizen-soldier for 5 years. He was 24 years old.\n  For his valorous service, Sergeant Potter was awarded the Bronze Star \nMedal and the Purple Heart. He was awarded the Kentucky Distinguished \nService Medal, which is the second highest honor that the Commonwealth\n\n[[Page S9871]]\n\nof Kentucky can bestow. He had also received both the Army Reserve \nComponent Achievement Medal and the Army Achievement Medal numerous \ntimes in his years of service.\n  Sergeant Potter's aspiration to defend others dates back to his \nformative years, when he dreamed of one day becoming a police officer. \nWhile a student at Butler High School, in Louisville, he joined the \nJefferson County Police Explorers, a program for boys and girls \ninterested in a law enforcement career.\n  There he experienced all of the inner workings of law enforcement, \nand learned what the phrase ``protect and serve'' truly meant. He \nserved as Captain of his Explorer Post and was named Male Explorer of \nthe Year in 1998.\n  Darrin decided to enlist in the Kentucky National Guard and join the \nmilitary police before he graduated high school in order to help him \nachieve his life-long goal of joining the Jefferson County Police \nDepartment. He wanted to gain invaluable experience with law \nenforcement and serve his community and his country.\n  Shortly before his 21st birthday, Sergeant Potter was deployed to \nBosnia for a peacekeeping mission. He served with honor for 7 months. \nCaptain Adrian Wheeler, Darrin's company commander in Iraq who also \nserved with him in Bosnia, says that Darrin ``could be trusted with an \nimportant decision. He was physically tough, he was mentally tough.''\n  In late 2001, near the end of his deployment in Bosnia, Sergeant \nPotter realized his dream and was accepted to the Jefferson County \nPolice Academy. The session was to start 2 weeks before he was due back \nfrom Bosnia. Undeterred, Darrin arranged with his commanders and the \nacademy to leave Bosnia one week early and start at the academy one \nweek late. Nothing would deflect him from his goal, and on February 1, \n2002, he was sworn in as a Jefferson County police officer. His mother, \nLynn Romans, called it ``the happiest day of his life.''\n  The rest of Sergeant Potter's unit returned from Bosnia on September \n10, 2001. The next day was to be their welcome-home party. Instead, \nSeptember 11 will be remembered as the day when America's mission in \nthe world, and the mission of our armed forces, forever changed.\n  Sergeant Potter was deployed in Iraq in February 2003. Darrin and his \nunit were charged with guarding prisoners and escorting the many \nconvoys which traveled in and out of Baghdad. It was a mission which \nsuited Darrin's experience with law enforcement well. He served nobly \nand with great valor, and made everyone in our Commonwealth proud.\n  Since childhood, it was clear Darrin Potter had a strong, energetic \nspirit. Born in Flemingsburg, he grew up as a bright young boy who \nenjoyed sports, playing in Little League and in countless games of \nwiffleball, baseball and softball after school. As a child he lived in \nPleasureville, Frankfort, Maysville, and finally Louisville, making \nfriends wherever he went.\n  At age 5, it was not unusual for boys ten years older than Darrin to \nshow up at his door, asking if he could come out and play. Perhaps it \nis because Darrin's dad, David, had lots of softball equipment. But all \nthose who knew him would say that his endearing, fun-loving personality \nplayed no small part in his popularity.\n  Darrin grew up rooting for the University of Louisville Cardinals and \nthe Cincinnati Reds. He loved Corvettes, and as a young man bought a \nred Corvette, which he treasured and protected. His father was his best \nfriend, and the two often played softball together on the weekends. He \nwas a good student, but he sometimes got into trouble for talking too \nmuch. You see, Darrin genuinely liked people.\n  One of the very first things Darrin did upon arriving in Iraq was to \nbuild a volleyball court. In the middle of the desert, Darrin took out \nhis tape measure and set up a perfect court for the soldiers to have \nvolleyball tournaments.\n  Captain Wheeler, Darrin's company commander in Iraq, has said of \nDarrin, ``he was just a regular guy, but a pretty extraordinary regular \nguy.''\n  I would suspect that Sergeant Potter would have humbly considered \nhimself a pretty ordinary guy. But the very fact that he and so many \nother ordinary Americans make such heroic choices--to guard others from \ndanger by confronting it head on--is what makes them extraordinary, and \nmakes America a truly extraordinary country.\n  We thank Darrin's parents, David Potter and Lynn Romans, and his \nsister, Anita Potter, for sharing Darrin's life story with us, and for \nbeing here today.\n  We are profoundly indebted to Sergeant Potter for his service and his \nsacrifice. Our sadness is tempered with the knowledge that his mission \nwas to protect the freedoms we enjoy here in America, and to spread \nthose freedoms throughout the world.\n  I ask my colleagues to keep the family of Sergeant Darrin Potter in \ntheir thoughts and prayers as we continue to pursue a path forward for \nour country. I know they will be in mine.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                         Independent Commission\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I wish to speak for a few minutes on the \nproposal for an independent commission to look into what has happened \nin the Gulf States. This issue has been spoken about, worked on so hard \nand so carefully by Senator Reid, Leader Pelosi, my colleague, Senator \nClinton, and many others.\n  I speak from the experience of the devastation that occurred in New \nYork after the terrorist attack almost 4 years ago. It will be 4 years \nthis Sunday, and many of us will be at Ground Zero commemorating that.\n  I think of that every day to this moment, the people I knew who were \nlost--a guy I played basketball with in high school, a businessman who \nhelped me on the way up, a firefighter from the community in which I \nwas raised. I wear this flag. I put it on September 12, and I wear it \nevery day and, God willing, will every day for the rest of my life in \nmemory of those who were lost.\n  One of the main desires of the families of those who were killed in \n9/11 was to get to the bottom of it. I believe it was a selfless \ndesire, a desire to figure out what went wrong so it would not happen \nagain.\n  Now we face a tragedy of similar consequence although of different \norigin, and that is the hurricane in the Gulf and the lack of an \nexcellent response to it. Obviously, our first concern has to be \nrescuing those who are still in need of help, making immediate \nprovision for the hundreds of thousands of individuals who were \ndisplaced and trying to deal with the immediate aftermath. Then we will \nhave a longer term job of restoring the city of New Orleans.\n  I have talked with Senator Landrieu and Congressman Jefferson about \nwhat we learned in New York about bringing people back to an area that \nhad become temporarily abandoned. That is what happened to downtown on \n9/11. But another thing we are going to have to do is figure out what \nwent wrong with the same positive motivation that motivated us after 9/\n11, and that is so we might reduce the chances of loss of life, loss of \nproperty in the aftermath of it happening again.\n  We learned one thing. We learned very simply that the best way to get \nto the bottom of this is have an impartial, nonpartisan commission not \ncomposed of politicians. The best way to get to the bottom of this, \nfrankly, is to repeat the experience of the 9/11 Commission and have a \ngroup of people--many experts in different fields, some citizens with \nmotivation to find out what went wrong--and give them the authority \nthey need, the resources they need, the time they need, and let them \nget to the bottom of it.\n  Frankly, there has been a lot of discussion of how we should do this \nin the House and Senate. From what I understand, the majority leader is \nnow considering simply having joint hearings with the Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs Committee, joined with the House. I have no \nobjection to that, but I will say this: When elected officials, when \npoliticians are on a commission, generally it does not work\n\n[[Page S9872]]\n\nout. Republicans will have a natural view to defend the administration. \nDemocrats will have a natural view to attack the administration. Both \nare legitimate roles. But to assure the public that the truth will \nactually be found, a nonpartisan commission, not composed of elected \nofficials, is the best way to go.\n  The calls for doing things in the House and Senate with our \nparticular needs--appropriations, oversight of various Government \nagencies--is not a bad one, but only if it is not a substitute for an \nindependent commission.\n  I hope my colleagues will rise to the call in the next few weeks and \nmonths. We do not have to constitute this commission immediately, but \nwe should do it soon enough because, again, the only way to assure the \npublic that we are getting to the bottom of this is to have a \ncommission that is nonpartisan and not populated by politicians, each \nof whom has a legitimate ax to grind--a legitimate ax to grind, but it \nis an ax to grind nonetheless.\n  I wish to make one other point before I yield the floor. The initial \ncalls for an independent commission after 9/11 were resisted. They were \nresisted by the administration, and they were resisted by many in the \nHouse and Senate. But it was the fortitude of the families of the \nvictims, the survivors--Kristen Breitweiser and her colleagues from New \nJersey, so many of the families I know from New York--who forced the \nCommission to occur.\n  My guess, my prediction is this: If we do not form that commission \nourselves, on our own volition quickly, at some point the citizens of \nthe Gulf States will demand that we do so in any case as we move past \nthe tragedy and hopefully begin to rebuild for those who have been \ncaught in this gulf catastrophe. Those who lost loved ones, at least \nsome of them will do what was done in New York. They will band together \nand try to do everything they can to help a community they love. And \nthey will urge us and importune us, just as the families in New York \ndid, to form such a commission. That is my guess. It is just how things \nare. And it is the right thing to do. So let us do it now. Again, it \ndoes not have to be done next week. It probably should not be done next \nweek. Our main goal should be to focus on helping those who need help. \nBut within the next month or two, without question, if we really want \nto get to the bottom of what went wrong to prevent it from happening \nagain, we should form an independent commission, not composed of \nelected officials with an ax to grind but nonpartisan citizens of \nvarious expertise to figure out what went wrong and to give us guidance \nas to how to avoid it in the future.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask I be allowed to proceed as though in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Defense Authorization\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is essential that we turn promptly to \nconsideration of the Defense authorization bill. Our troops are \nfighting in Iraq and Afghanistan and providing law and order and saving \nlives in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The Defense authorization \nbill contains numerous provisions to improve their compensation and \nenhance the quality of their lives and their families' lives. Passing \nthe Defense authorization bill sends an unmistakable message that we \ncare about them and that as a nation we appreciate their sacrifices.\n  More than 64,000 Active-Duty and National Guard troops have been sent \nto the Gulf Coast where they are assisting in the recovery from \nHurricane Katrina. These troops are playing a critical role in \nconducting search and rescue missions; evacuating displaced persons; \nproviding security in impacted areas; delivering essential food, water, \nand medicine; and rebuilding damaged infrastructure throughout the \nregion. I saw firsthand last Sunday in Battle Creek, in my home State \nof Michigan, just how effective and professional the Michigan National \nGuard is in preparing for the needs of hundreds of evacuees of Katrina.\n  And, of course, about 138,000 American soldiers, sailors, airmen, and \nmarines are engaged in taking on aggressive insurgency in Iraq, and \n17,000 remain in harm's way in Afghanistan. Tens of thousands more are \nsupporting the war effort through deployment thousands of miles from \nhome. Our Armed Forces also continue to bear the brunt of the \ncontinuing effort to stabilize and rebuild Afghanistan, keep the peace \nin Bosnia, Kosovo, and other hot spots, while remaining prepared to \nexecute other missions in support of the national military strategy.\n  Some of these troops deployed overseas are from the Gulf Coast area. \nSome of them will soon return home to find that Katrina has damaged or \ndestroyed their homes. Some will have nothing left. Taking up and \npassing the national Defense bill will improve their quality of life \nwhile they remain on active duty and when serving in hurricane recovery \nduty. Passage of the Defense bill will send an important message to \nthem that we as a nation understand their loss and appreciate their \nservice.\n  At a time when members of our Armed Forces are performing heroically \nboth at home and overseas to make our country safer and stronger, it \nwould be unconscionable to give the Defense authorization bill anything \nless than top legislative priority. Our military both needs and \ndeserves the support that Congress can provide in the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  First and foremost, the Defense authorization bill would support our \ntroops by improving compensation and quality of life for our service \nmen and women and their families as they face hardships imposed by \ncontinuing military operations within the United States and around the \nworld. For example, the bill would provide funding for a 3.1-percent \nacross-the-board pay raise for military personnel. The bill contains a \n$70 million increase in childcare and family assistance services for \nmilitary families and $50 million in supplemental educational aid to \nschool districts affected by the assignment or location of military \nfamilies. The bill would provide increases in housing allowances and \npayment of over 20 types of bonuses and special pay for our service men \nand women.\n  The bill will increase the death gratuity paid to survivors of our \nmilitary personnel who die while on duty. It would increase their life \ninsurance to $400,000. And that total death benefit of $500,000 is a \nsmall price for a nation to pay to a family of a soldier or sailor, an \nairmen or marine who has made the ultimate sacrifice of giving his or \nher life in service to our Nation.\n  If the Defense authorization bill is not enacted, the military's \nauthority to pay bonuses and special pay to our men and women in \nuniform will expire, exacerbating an already troublesome problem that \nwe face in recruitment and retention. If this bill is not enacted, the \nenhanced death gratuity of $100,000 and the increased life insurance \nbenefit that we enacted for servicemembers earlier this year will lapse \nand substantially lower benefits will be reinstated. If this bill is \nnot enacted, more than $6 billion in military construction and family \nhousing projects to improve the conditions in which our servicemembers \nwork and live will be unable to proceed.\n  The Senate obviously has a lengthy list of legislation that it wants \nto consider and needs to consider over the next few months, but surely \nif we truly value the contribution that our Armed Forces have made and \ncontinue to make every day, each and every minute at home and abroad, \ntaking up and passing the Defense authorization bill before the end of \nthis month will reflect that sentiment. It is essential we do so. We \nhave many things to take up, but I can't think of anything more \nimportant, other than our response directly to Katrina to help the \nvictims and their families, than taking up and passing the \nDefense authorization bill.\n\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor. I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I want to speak for a few minutes on one \nof the amendments the Senate just adopted by unanimous consent. That \namendment contained the Combat Meth Act that Senator Feinstein, my good \nfriend and distinguished colleague from California, and I have \ncosponsored along with 40 other Senators. It is the most comprehensive \nmethamphetamine legislation ever introduced, much less passed by this \nbody, and I want to begin my brief remarks by thanking the Senator from \nAlabama and his staff for working with us, and the Senator from \nKentucky for his good work. I know my friend from California feels the \nsame way. We are very grateful for their efforts in including this \namendment in this bill. It was very important to do.\n  It is amazing, since we introduced this bill, the response that we \nhave had within this body and from the law enforcement and the social \nservices community around the country. Senators and America are aware \nof the fact that methamphetamine is the single most deadly drug threat \nwe have confronted certainly in my time in public life in the 20 years \nthat I have been in legislative bodies. As bad as the other drugs are, \nit is worse than the other drugs. It is almost immediately addictive.\n  Let us send a message out right now: You cannot use methamphetamine \ncasually. If you take it, you are going to get addicted to it. It \nchanges the physical structure of the brain. It causes people to be \nmore aggressive. It can turn some people into maniacs. Law enforcement \nwill tell you other drugs are not as dangerous because they are \npassive. Methamphetamine causes people to become more aggressive. It \nchanges the physical structure of the brain. It causes people to become \nmore aggressive. It is almost instantly addictive and there is no known \nmedical model for getting people off it. There is no methadone for \nmethamphetamine.\n  I talked to a substance abuse counsellor from Marriville, MO, about \nthis one time. He had been in his line, in his profession, for 16 \nyears, and he said: When I counsel somebody in trying to get somebody \noff methamphetamine, I just use the 12-step program and I rely heavily \non the first step. There is a higher power who can help you because \nthat is what it takes to get off methamphetamine. And there are some \npeople who do. It is heroic and miraculous. But we have no known \neffective treatment. It is the perfect storm of drugs because in \naddition to all that, methamphetamine, unlike other drugs, is not just \nsold and consumed in our neighborhoods, which would be bad enough, it \nis made in our neighborhoods. And the process by which it is made, \nwhich is it is concocted in labs, presents by itself a huge set of \nproblems and causes a huge number of social pathologies which our local \nauthorities have been fighting heroically for years and years.\n  Methamphetamine labs are toxic. The process by which the drug is made \nand then used is toxic. There are all kinds of toxic chemicals that are \nbeing used. So when these meth cooks operate a lab in a home or a van, \nthey create a toxic waste dump. It costs $10,000 to clean it up. Our \nlaw enforcement officers have to be trained, not only as law \nenforcement officers but as environmental experts, because as they take \ndown these meth labs they have to break them down, and it costs a lot \nof money, not even counting the training costs. Then the chemicals have \nto be disposed of in an environmentally safe way. That costs a lot of \nmoney. Because these labs are out there operating, it presents a whole \nhost of additional dangers to our children, even beyond the fact that \ntheir parents or caregivers may be using a seriously deadly drug, \nbecause these kids are growing up in homes that are toxic.\n  I have had social service workers in Missouri tell me that when they \npull children out of these environments, they have to decontaminate \nthem, sometimes two or three times, because the residue of these toxins \nis all over their bodies. It is tragic and terrible. I have had law \nenforcement officers tell me they will go in and the air is so bad they \nhave to wear breathing filters or moon suits, and there are little \nchildren running around within a few feet.\n\n[[Page S9874]]\n\nThey have seen cradles next to methamphetamine labs. All of this is a \nproblem with methamphetamine that does not exist with other drugs, as \ndangerous and as terrible as other drugs may be.\n  Methamphetamine is epidemic. The fact that it is relatively easy to \nmake the drug and the information about it is all over the Internet \nmeans that there are, in my State alone, law enforcement tells me, \nhundreds, perhaps thousands of labs operating in isolated areas, and \noften in not so isolated areas. The home next door may be making \nmethamphetamine. They make it in cars and vans. I have fire protection \ndistrict chiefs in urban and suburban areas tell me half the vehicle \nfires they are fighting are meth related, because this is a dangerous \nprocess in which this drug is made, even resulting in fires or \nexplosions--and these are chemical fires they have to fight.\n  I said in urban or suburban areas, because it is not just a rural \nproblem anymore. It started there, but it spread to our urban and \nsuburban areas. The consciousness of this moved many Members of this \nbody to support this bill when Senator Feinstein and I sponsored it, \nand to support it passionately. I was moved and pleased by the number \nof Senators who came, at our initial press conference, and spoke \nmovingly because, of course, we get around in our States. We talk to \npeople. We see the devastation and we have heard law enforcement, and \nthe Senate has acted by adding the Combat Meth Act to this legislation.\n  I am very pleased about it. We have a chance now to send this over to \nthe House. If the Senate approves the bill, which I am confident it \nwill, I hope early next week, then we can get this bill passed and sent \nto the President's desk.\n  I promised to be brief. I was not, although I am sure listeners \nunderstand that brevity in the Senate means something different than it \nmay mean in other places. But the bill contains a number of important \nprovisions. Probably the centerpiece of it is a provision that would \ntake cold medicines that contain pseudoephedrine and put them behind \npharmacy counters around the country. This has been done in a number of \nStates. Missouri is a leader in this. Oklahoma is a leader. Iowa is a \nleader. I thank Senator Coburn for his efforts in helping us, and \nSenator Grassley for his efforts, helping us. They know what \nmethamphetamine is, coming from the States from which they come. This \nwould put these precursor drugs behind pharmacy counters. It means \nconsumers will still have access but meth cooks will not. Because they \nhave to assemble 20 or 30 or 40 packages of cold medicines in order to \nmake methamphetamine, they will not be able to do it anymore. They will \nnot be able to steal it or buy it because it is going to be behind \npharmacy counters.\n  Then, in addition, there are a number of targeted grant programs \ndesigned to assist our law enforcement and social service workers \nstopping this drug and dealing with the terrible fallout from it.\n  I am grateful to all those involved. We need to move now to the next \nstep. We need to keep working in other ways, above and beyond this \nbill, in which we can stop this deadly drug.\n  I am grateful to all those who helped make this day possible, and I \nknow I speak for Senator Feinstein saying we are very pleased the \nSenate has adopted this and added it to this measure and that now we \nare in a position to send it to the House.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, before the Senator from Missouri leaves \nthe floor, I want to extend on behalf of every Member of the Senate our \nthanks to him for his leadership in fighting the scourge of \nmethamphetamine. The Senator from Missouri has become the leader in the \nSenate in combating this scourge. On behalf of all Members of the \nSenate, I thank him for his extraordinarily effective work in this most \nimportant area.\n  Mr. TALENT. Will the Senator yield for a minute?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, the Senator has yielded the floor so I can \nadd, for a moment, that I very much appreciate his kind words. I did \nnot in my remarks talk at great length about Senator Feinstein's \nefforts. I will have the opportunity to do it. I have done that in the \npast and I will have the opportunity to do that again.\n  The remarks of the Senator are very fine, but let me say Senator \nFeinstein has been on this issue since at least the 1990s. She saw it \ncoming. We have not completed anything yet. We still have to get this \nover to the House and pass it. There are other things we have to do. \nThe remarks of the Senator are very kind, but Senator Feinstein is the \noutstanding leader. It has been a great pleasure to work with her to \nthis point and I look forward to continuing to work with her and other \nSenators from both sides of the aisle, getting this done completely, \nincluding the Senator from Kentucky. I know what a problem this is in \nKentucky. He and I talked about this. I am grateful for his assistance.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/09/senate-section/article/S9874-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

REHNQUIST\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, on behalf of the people of Minnesota I \nhave taken the floor today to express our condolences to Rehnquist \nfamily for their loss and gratitude and admiration for his \nextraordinary life of service.\n  The Midwest, where William Rehnquist was born, does not have the high \nmountains or the pounding ocean surf of other parts of the country. We \nlearn from our geography the value of moderation and dependability. \nWilliam Rehnquist was a solid human being whose consistency and resolve \nas a member of the Supreme Court benefited the whole country in \nturbulent times.\n  The historian Whitehead has written that the essence of leadership is \nmaintaining order in the midst of change, and change in the midst of \norder. William Rehnquist lived out the principle that both change and \norder are necessary in the law and he knew when we needed each.\n  Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist served America with great \ndistinction on the Supreme Court for 33 years. His profound respect for \nthe Constitution and his collegial relationships throughout the \njudiciary will be a standard for future justices. He knew that his role \nwas more than deciding cases: it was to raise the knowledge of and \nrespect for the rule of law.\n  Mr. Rehnquist took his seat as an associate Supreme Court justice in \n1972 after being appointed by President Richard Nixon, and became Chief \nJustice in 1986, during the Reagan administration.\n  His opinions reflected a staunch adherence to the constitutional \nprinciple of State's rights. He also displayed an untiring willingness \nto work with his colleagues to find a compromise without minimizing his \nposition. Chief Justice Rehnquist will be remembered as one of our most \ninfluential chief justices in history.\n  As the Court's most junior justice, Rehnquist made state sovereignty \nhis central principle of American constitutional law. At times, \nespecially in those early years in 1973, he stood alone in his support \nof State sovereignty but continued this fight to the end of his time on \nthe bench.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist succeeded in shifting the balance of power \nbetween States and the Federal government. The control and limitation \nof Federal control will always be a legacy of Chief Justice Rehnquist. \nHe protected the Constitution in his application of the law and took \ngreat pride in his protection of civil liberties and the importance of \nfreedom and the democratic spirit in our Constitution.\n  As Chief Justice, Mr. Rehnquist made his mark on the Court with grace \nin an environment where justices of varying opinions could express \nthemselves free from personal attacks and or ideological stalemates. \nHis was a Court of strong personalities who operated in profound \nrespect for each other and the country gained from their wisdom and \ndiscourse. He was a great leader and effective administrator of the \nSupreme Court.\n\n[[Page S9875]]\n\n  I was personally touched by Chief Justice Rehnquist's determination \nand heroic passion to serve while battling cancer. As we often hear, we \nare a government of law and not men and women, and that is true. But \nour constitutional principles are not self enforcing. We depend on men \nand women of good hearts and sharp minds to steer us through difficult \nmoments when the issues of the day collide with our Constitution of \nover 200 years of age.\n  He was to the end a midwesterner: strong, reliable and devoted to the \nidea of leaving things better than he found them. The whole Nation, and \nfuture generations of Americans should be deeply grateful for the \nlegacy he has left.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/09/senate-section/article/S9875-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           SMALL BUSINESS CONTRACTING PROVISIONS IN H.R. 3673\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as chair of the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship, I rise today to bring to the attention \nof the Senate a proposal which was included in the hurricane \nsupplemental bill at the request of the Office of Management and Budget \nand the Department of Defense. I wholeheartedly supported the \nsupplemental bill and the funding it would provide to the individuals, \nfamilies, and small businesses that experienced so much suffering in \nthis terrible tragedy. Their plight should not be prolonged by delays \nin delivery of much-needed assistance funding. However, I believe that \nthis particular provision would seriously harm small businesses in the \nGulf Coast region and all across America--by excluding them from \nGovernment contracts and subcontracts for the relief and rescue \nprojects. While I appreciate the need to get supplies and services \nquickly in order to save lives, the provision at issue is not tailored \nto lifesaving, and we need to exercise caution in working around laws \naimed at helping small business, in the rush to pass emergency \nappropriations.\n  The OMB's proposal extends to hurricane relief and rescue operations \nthat the emergency procurement authority previously approved by \nCongress for military contingency operations in cases of attack by the \nweapons of mass destruction, war, or national emergency. Most \nimportantly, the proposal raises the so-called ``micro-purchase \nthreshold'' to $250,000. These measures would abolish Small Business \nAct set-asides for U.S. small businesses and the Buy American Act \npreferences for U.S. manufacturers on all rescue and relief contracts \nfor years to come, potentially undermine the Stafford Act preference \nfor local business, individuals, and organizations in contracts for \nrecovery from major disasters contained in the Stafford Act, and \nencourage waste, fraud, and abuse in Federal contracts and in the \nreconstruction efforts by drastically increasing the ability of low-\nlevel Government officials to make credit card charges.\n  The micro-purchase threshold was created in the 1990s to enable \nGovernment officials to quickly make limited purchases with Government \ncredit cards and without regards to competition, small business, or \nother preference requirements. Congress strictly limited the current \nmicro-purchase threshold amounts to $2,500 for all acquisitions, except \nto $2,000 for certain construction projects and to $15,000 for U.S.-\nbased military contingency operations and WMD response and recovery \nefforts.\n  This increase in the micro-purchase threshold was carefully adopted \nby Congress just 2 years ago, in November 2003, in response to the 9/11 \nand the global war on terror. The 2003 increase was implemented subject \nto strict limitations to ensure that contracting accountability and \nsmall business requirements are not supplanted--limitations which are \nabsent from the language in this bill.\n  The OMB plan in this bill increases the micro-purchase threshold to \n$250,000, a hundredfold increase. Without appropriate protections, such \na massive increase distorts Congressional intent for the micro-\npurchases and opens doors to greater credit card contracting abuse. \nGovernment purchase card abuse has been the subject of investigative \nand legislative actions by the Senate Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee and by the Senate Finance Committee. \nIndeed, the leadership of these Committees, including Chairmen Grassley \nand Collins as well as ranking member Lieberman, already made known \ntheir opposition to the OMB proposal. The Government Accountability \nOffice estimates that the Federal Government could have saved $300 \nmillion a year by imposing greater accountability on the use of \nGovernment purchase cards. These losses stand to balloon along with the \nhuge increases in credit card spending called for in this proposal. A \nmassive expansion of the micro-purchase threshold could overwhelm the \nfragile accountability mechanisms for this program.\n  Most importantly, in addition to the high potential for waste and \nabuse, raising the micro-purchase threshold from its current levels to \n$250,000 obliterates small business contracting set-asides for \ncontracts that by law and by tradition have been going to small firms. \nThe statutory ``small business reserve'' in the Small Business Act sets \naside for small business concerns all Federal contracts in the amounts \nbelow $100,000 and above the micro-purchase threshold, typically, \n$2,500. Contracts at $100,000 or less are uniquely suitable for \nperformance by small firms. Excluding them now makes no sense.\n\n  Further, the DoD/OMB proposal for extension of the emergency \nprocurement authority to Hurricane Katrina improperly expands the scope \nof this authority to future ``relief'' contracts and to contracts with \nonly distant relevance to Hurricane Katrina. As I already mentioned, \nthe emergency procurement authority established a micro-purchase \nthreshold increase to $15,000, provided the purchases are ``directly \nrelated'' to military contingency operations or WMD recovery. Extension \nof this authority would take contracts ranging from $15,000 to $2,500 \nout of the statutory ``small business reserve'' under the Small \nBusiness Act. In addition, this authority would also allow large firms \nto exclude small businesses from subcontracts by treating all Katrina-\nrelated contracts as purchases of commercial items. Taking work away \nfrom small businesses as part of disaster relief is not the message we \nwant to send.\n  Federal small business contracts are a vital source of business and \njobs creation for small firms. Prior to Katrina, small business in \ndisaster-affected States used to received a significant boost from \nFederal contracts. Retaining, renewing, and enhancing these small \nbusiness contracts will be critical for successful reconstruction of \nthe Gulf Coast region. For example, in Fiscal Year 2003, Alabama small \nbusinesses received $2.05 billion in Federal contracts, including $191 \nmillion in construction contracts. Small businesses in the State of \nMississippi received $419 million in Federal contracts, with over a \nquarter of that amount, $134 million, in construction contracts. \nFinally, Louisiana received $712 million in small business contracts, \nincluding $242 million in construction. Small business men and women in \nthese States have the experience and the wherewithal to join hands in \nthe relief and reconstruction of their communities. What they need is a \nchance to work and rebuild their businesses.\n  We have an obligation to help the small business sector of the Gulf \nCoast. I am very concerned about the import of the OMB contracting \nprovision, and I will work to ensure that this provision is limited and \nmodified in future legislation to ensure that it provides the right \nbalance between speed and fairness in Government contracts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/09/senate-section/article/S9875-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9875-S9876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HURRICANE KATRINA\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I join my Senate colleagues in voicing my \nunwavering support to help Gulf Coast residents recover and rebuild \ntheir communities in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The $60.5 \nbillion in funding we have passed is a start toward restoring basic \ninfrastructure and the economy, but we have a long way to go. This \nrecovery will require much more of our time, resources and a \ncomprehensive plan; I stand ready to work with my colleagues to do just \nthat.\n  In the last 2 weeks, I have witnessed many good and bad things \ninvolving Hurricane Katrina. The generosity and compassion shown by \nfamilies all over the Nation have redefined the meaning of good \nneighbor. In Arkansas, I have\n\n[[Page S9876]]\n\nwatched as countless charities, individuals from the private and public \nsector and the faith-based community joined together to welcome their \nneighbors with unmatched Southern hospitality.\n  I am very proud of the Arkansas National Guard. Many of these Guard \nmembers have spent months in Iraq away from their families this year, \nbut they were eager to join the military operation to help rescue \nHurricane victims, secure the streets of New Orleans, and maintain \norder in many of our shelters. I am also pleased that these Guard \nmembers have been mobilized under title 32 so that their time counts \nfor purposes of retirement, health care and other benefits enjoyed by \ntheir\nActive-Duty counterparts.\n  After the initial devastation of Hurricane Katrina, I called my Gulf \nCoast colleagues to ask how I could help and support their constituents \nin their time of need. I am working to honor their requests by \ncoordinating logistics for evacuees and helping evacuees in Arkansas \nresolve problems involving Social Security checks, postal services, and \nFEMA forms. My office is also working to find housing for evacuees, \ntransport them, reunite families, and assist with translation. As \n60,000 or more of their constituents have traveled to Arkansas, I am \nworking to serve their constituents as well as Arkansans. Evacuees \nshould know that as they get their lives back together, they have a \nhome in Arkansas.\n  While the American people were stepping up to the plate, the \nGovernment struck out. Our emergency plans failed to meet expectations. \nI want to focus on helping distressed families now, but in the not too \ndistant future, we need to take a hard look at the failures that \noccurred in responding to this disaster.\n  Under Senate rules, Senators Collins and Lieberman are tasked with \nleading Government oversight as the ranking members of the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee. As a member of this \ncommittee, I can attest to their strong, bipartisan, and tested \nleadership. The intelligence restructuring bill drafted in this \ncommittee, passed by this body, and signed into law by President Bush \nlast year is a fitting example. This same committee ought to pursue its \noversight responsibilities on the Government's slow rescue and response \nefforts. I believe very adamantly that part of any investigation, and \nsubsequent legislation, must begin with fixing the chain-of-command and \nbureaucratic breakdowns that occurred before and after the hurricane. \nIf the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee is not \ntapped for this undertaking, then I believe the families of the Gulf \nCoast, and the rest of the Nation, deserve a thorough review of the \nmistakes that occurred by an independent body in a setting where \npolitics will not play a role.\n  A primary reason for the creation of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, following 9/11, was to allow for a smooth and immediate \nrescue and recovery operation when disaster strikes--whether naturally \noccurring or manmade. But instead of a smooth operation, States and \nFederal agencies again ran into redtape and confusion. A terrorist \nattack and a hurricane are, of course, two completely different \ndisasters, but the response efforts are just as critical and necessary, \nand they translate into saving lives.\n  We have put enormous resources into a national emergency preparedness \nand response system nearly 4 years after\n9/11, and I am concerned and dismayed that our response to a \nsignificant disaster has not been improved exponentially. The \nGovernment's failure to respond effectively shows weaknesses in our \nemergency preparedness not just to Americans but also to terrorists who \nseek havoc in our country.\n  We must find and fix the discrepancies in the system, look for \naccountability, and make sure these mistakes are never repeated in the \nUnited States again. We owe this to the victims of Hurricane Katrina \nand, quite frankly, we owe it to the victims of 9/11.\n  I believe the problems that occurred before, during and after the \nhurricane have unveiled something else about America. They have opened \nup eyes in Washington, DC, and across the country about the abject \npoverty some families live in. Those left stranded on their rooftops or \nin the Superdome painted a very vivid picture about the inequities that \nexist in our country today, and they speak volumes about the \ntransportation, housing and health care available in this country.\n  If anything at all comes from this tragedy, I hope it will be a new \nfocus on our priorities in this body. Before the hurricane hit, the \nSenate was expected to return from its August recess to vote on \nrepealing the estate tax for wealthiest 2 percent of Americans, and \ncutting health care services for our poorest Americans. Hurricane \nKatrina showed that we, as a Nation, are failing to take care of our \npoor, our sick, and our elderly. Government must do better, and that \nleadership must start with the President, the Senate, and the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  We can start with a number of proposals that have been put forth by \nboth Republicans and Democrats to help the South recover from Hurricane \nKatrina. These initiatives range from financial assistance to host \nStates for evacuee care; tax incentives for employers to hire evacuees; \nand health care, housing, and nutritional assistance for evacuees. I \nstand ready to help and lead in these efforts.\n  Senator Landrieu delivered an impassioned speech on the floor \nyesterday, and I end with her words, ``We must learn from this \nexperience. If we do not, we will fail again.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/09/senate-section/article/S9876-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMOVAL OF COSPONSOR TO S. 1014\n\n  Ms. SNOWE.

Mr. President, today I wish to offer a tribute \nto a valued friend, Jerry Waldor of South Orange, NJ. He passed away \nlast week at the age of 77.\n  Jerry ran his own successful insurance agency New Jersey for more \nthan 45 years. Jerry was justifiably proud of his success in business, \nbut that was only one aspect of his life. He was devoted to his family, \nhis community, and his country.\n  Jerry and his wife Rita were blessed with three sons and eight \ngrandchildren. He would talk glowingly about his family given the \nslightest opportunity to do so.\n\n[[Page S9877]]\n\n  Jerry Waldor was president of the United Jewish Federation of \nMetroWest, an umbrella social organization that provided services to \nthousands in northern New Jersey. He was a beloved community leader who \ntook a serious role in so many areas of importance to communities in \nour area of New Jersey. As is well known in these days of serious \nphilanthropy, it is not an uncommon practice to delay or even avoid \nmeetings or discussions with friends who volunteer to solicit funds no \nmatter how good and important the organization's agenda. Jerry Waldor \nwould phone me every year to solicit my contribution to the local \nJewish Federation, and I welcomed his call because his manner was so \npleasant and his own giving so generous. He also served as national \nvice chairman of the United Jewish Appeal and a director of the Council \nof Jewish Federations. He served on the boards of the American Jewish \nCommittee and the New Jersey YMHA camps. He also served as a director \nof the National Conference of Community and Justice and a trustee of \nCerebral Palsy of North Jersey.\n  Jerry also had a distinguished record of military service. He entered \nthe U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1946 and graduated as a \nsecond lieutenant in the Air Force.\n  During 5 years in the Air Force, he rose to the rank of captain, and \nworked as a deputy assistant for logistics in the Pentagon. After \ncompleting his active duty, he entered the Air Force Reserve, where he \nserved until 1983. He retired as a major general. During his military \ncareer, Jerry received the Distinguished Service Medal and the Legion \nof Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster.\n  Jerry touched many lives during his time on Earth, and his deeds and \nmemory will live on. I am proud to call him my friend. He will be \nmissed by all who knew him. I hope his family will take comfort in the \nrecall of their good fortune to have had him as husband, father, and \ngrandfather in these dark days.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/09/senate-section/article/S9877-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. DURBIN:\n       S. 1648.

Mr. President, this amendment is an attempt to make \nsure, to the best of our ability, that people, families, individuals \nalready devastated personally, psychologically, and physically by \nHurricane Katrina are not lastingly devastated financially as well.\n  Where hundreds of thousands of people were forced out of their homes, \nforced out of their neighborhoods, forced out of their communities, \nforced out of work, our Government, it seems to me, must do everything \nit can to help them rebuild their lives from whatever they can salvage \nfrom this enormously powerful and destructive storm.\n  This amendment that I propose this morning is based on title IV of \nthe Katrina Emergency Relief Act of 2005, which has been introduced by \nmy colleagues Senator Reid of Nevada and Senator Landrieu of Louisiana.\n  This amendment has seven main provisions, all of which are aimed at \nenabling the Federal Government to extend a hand--not a handout--to the \npeople who have been so shaken from their normal lives by this storm \nand give them the help to rebuild those lives in the best tradition of \nAmerican community responsibility for one another, and individual \nopportunities.\n  There are seven parts. Let me quickly enumerate them.\n  First, this amendment will waive the caps and cost sharing under the \nStanford Act, Individuals and Household\n\n[[Page S9888]]\n\nProgram, that provides aid to those whose needs cannot be met through \ninsurance or other assistance. Presently, these grants may not exceed \n$26,200 per individual or household. This provision would waive those \ncaps on home repair, rent, temporary housing, or home replacement.\n  ``Other Needs'' assistance under this IHP, so-called Individuals and \nHouseholds Program, also addresses medical, dental, and even funeral \nexpenses. The States are required to provide 25 percent of the amount \nprovided for some of these grants. Given the overwhelming nature of \nthis episode and the terrible financial impact on the States, this \nprovision would also waive the State contribution.\n  This is an opportunity to take care of some basic human needs, get \nsome help for dental, medical, funeral, and household needs.\n  Second, this amendment will temporarily reinstate the Mortgage and \nRental Payments Program, or coverage for rental or mortgage payments \nfor those in danger of defaulting on their mortgage and losing their \nhomes resulting from the financial hardship resulting from the \ndisaster. The program had been eliminated in the Disaster Mitigation \nAct of 2000 because FEMA said the program was difficult to administer. \nBut it was revived after September 11, with good cause, and it should \nbe revived again with, unfortunately, a similarly good cause in the \nwake of Katrina.\n  Three, the amendment calls for a 6-month moratorium on the imposition \nof any penalties or additional accrued interest for people whose lives \nhave been shaken by Hurricane Katrina and who fail to make timely \npayments for student loans, Small Business loans, or other loans made, \nsubsidized, or guaranteed by the Federal Government. This will allow a \nbreather for these people whose lives have been totally altered, \nremoved from their homes, from their workplaces, their neighborhoods, \nand it will give them a 6-month breather on any penalties or accrued \ninterest if they can't make payments for that period of time. This \namendment also authorizes the President to extend that moratorium for \nan additional 6 months.\n  Four, this amendment eases bankruptcy provisions that otherwise are \nscheduled to take effect about a month and a half from now. History \nshows that bankruptcies often double in the wake of a disaster. This \neasing will go simply to people affected by Hurricane Katrina in the \nthree Gulf States that were hit. Without this provision, many families \nhurt by this hurricane could wind up without access--not just hurt but \ndevastated financially--to the bankruptcy laws under the new law.\n  Fifth, this amendment would extend and expand benefits under the \nDisaster Unemployment Assistance Program. It would extend the \napplication period from 30 to 90 days. I know the Department of Labor \nand State officials are trying very hard to tell people they have a \nright to apply for this special form of unemployment assistance, to get \nsome money coming in to support their families. There is a 30-day \nperiod because everybody is spread so far apart. Normally in a \ndisaster, the disaster occurs and people go back basically to where \nthey were. Now they are spread all over the country. This would extend \nthe application period from 30 to 90 days.\n  In addition, it would expand the program to include individuals \neligible for State unemployment insurance and those who suffer from the \nsecondary economic effects of the disaster.\n  Finally, it would extend the duration of benefits for victims who \notherwise qualify from 26 to 52 weeks and create an enhanced minium \nbenefit level.\n  We have been reading stories that an amazing number of the people who \nwere dislocated by Hurricane Katrina and now are in other States are \nalready out looking for work and finding it. This is for the people who \nhaven't been able to find it, and it will give them some assistance for \ntheir families.\n  Estimates suggest that as many as a half million workers will be left \njobless by Hurricane Katrina, and that unemployment may soar to 25 \npercent or more in some of the regions affected as a result. The \nfamilies, therefore, will desperately need this extended lifeline this \namendment will provide.\n\n  Six, the amendment would suspend the tax and penalties on withdrawals \nfrom qualified retirement plans so that those who have suffered losses \nas a result of Hurricane Katrina can use money that otherwise would be \nin their retirement plans and for which they would be penalized for \nearly withdrawal. They can now rebuild their lives and not suffer \nadverse tax consequences. Individuals who access funds in these \naccounts would have 5 years to repay the money to the account.\n  In addition, the amendment calls on the Secretary of the Treasury to \nsuspend tax payment, return filing, and other time-limited actions \nrequired of taxpayers for a period of not less than 6 months. In other \nwords, it would give these people not a free pass but a little bit of \nspace before they have to go back to fulfilling all the obligations \nrequired, without diminishing those obligations.\n  I know by administrative action the Treasury Secretary has already \nsaid for people in these areas who would be paying estimated tax \npayments--I believe on September 15--they will not have to pay until \nthe end of October.\n  Seven, we must feed the victims. It is as elemental as that.\n  We all saw the devastation this hurricane wreaked in terms of \ndisplaced families, destroyed livelihoods, and flooded homes. We also \nknow how it affected the fundamental need for water and food. Across \nConnecticut and across America, I am sure the power of this act of \nnature was stunning. Of course, loss of life filled us with grief. But \nwhat really angered and in some sense embarrassed a lot of people \nacross this country was to see our fellow human beings and fellow \nAmericans trapped by this disaster without adequate access to food or \nwater.\n  This amendment provides additional funding to purchase and distribute \nfood and temporarily suspend food stamp requirements that, frankly, \ndon't make sense in the wake of this disaster. I am thinking of a \nrequirement that says a victim has to show proof that his or her car \nwas worth less than $4,600. It is probably hard for a lot of people who \nwould otherwise qualify for food stamps to be able to make that \nshowing. We ought to suspend it.\n  Those are the seven parts of this proposal in this amendment. When \nall is said and done, the first step in rebuilding for most of these \npeople will be to get back on a firm financial footing again. That is \nexactly the intent of this proposal. It is to give these people a \nbreather, to give them a little temporary help. It is our Nation's way \nand our Federal Government's way of doing what neighbors and \nindividuals are doing all over America, which is to reach out. I think \nit is the most generous expression of caring for one another I have \never seen in the history of this country, and it is our Government's \nway of trying to do the same so that people, once back on their feet, \ncan begin to walk and then run to a better life.\n  I thank the Chair.

Mr. President, so many Members of this Chamber have \nstood on the floor this past week to speak about the victims of the \ndisaster, the catastrophe down in the gulf region, to speak of the \nvictims of Hurricane Katrina. This morning I would like to spend a few \nbrief moments to talk about some other victims, some very young \nvictims, victims of a disease that is absolutely entirely preventable. \nThis morning I speak very briefly about those young children who are \nborn with a fetal alcohol disorder.\n  The ninth hour of the ninth day of the ninth month having arrived \ntoday, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate observe a very brief \nmoment of reflection to remind women who are pregnant or those who may \nsoon become pregnant that no amount of alcohol--none at all--is safe to \nconsume during the 9 months of pregnancy.\n\n[[Page S9889]]\n\n  If we may have a brief moment of reflection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (moment of silence.)\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, thank you.\n  By raising awareness one moment, one person at a time, we can \nminimize the harm that drinking during pregnancy causes to our most \nvulnerable population, and that is our children.\n  In February of 1999, there was a small group of parents who were \nraising children afflicted with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. These \nparents set out to change the world. That small group started an online \nsupport group which quickly became a worldwide grassroots movement to \nobserve September 9 as International Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders \nAwareness Day. Former Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle was \ninstrumental in having the Senate take notice of this important issue. \nHe has worked very hard on this issue, and continues so today. We thank \nhim for his efforts.\n  This year, for the seventh consecutive year, communities across the \nNation are pausing at the hour of 9:09 a.m. to acknowledge this day.\n  Events are occurring in cities and towns not just across the country \nbut around the world--from Chilliwack, British Columbia, to Cape Town, \nSouth Africa, to Madagascar. Families are joining today to raise \nawareness of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorder, or FASD.\n  In Alaska, Alaskans will observe this day in solemn events in \nAnchorage, Juneau, Kenai, Fairbanks, and other communities.\n  FASD is an umbrella term that describes a range of physical and \nmental birth defects that can occur in a fetus when a pregnant woman \nconsumes alcohol. It is a leading cause of nonhereditary mental \nretardation in the United States. Many children affected by maternal \ndrinking during pregnancy have irreversible conditions, including \nsevere brain damage. It is causing permanent lifelong disability. We \nhave to keep this in perspective.\n  FASD is 100 percent preventable. Prevention merely requires a woman \nto abstain from alcohol during pregnancy. Knowing that it is entirely \npreventable, it is amazing to me to think that every year in this \ncountry an estimated 1 in every 100 babies are born with FASD. That is \nabout 40,000 infants annually. FASD affects more children than Down's \nsyndrome, cerebral palsy, spina bifida, and muscular dystrophy \ncombined.\n  The cost of FASD is huge: More than $3 billion each year in direct \nhealth care costs and many times that amount in lost human potential. \nLifetime health costs for an individual living with FASD can average \n$860,000.\n  The indirect financial and social costs to the Nation are even \ngreater, including specialized health care, education, foster care, job \ntraining, cost of incarceration, general support services.\n  All in all, the direct and indirect economic costs of FASD in the \nUnited States are estimated to be $5.4 billion. FASD is found in every \ncommunity in America, in Native, non-Native, rich, poor. It does not \ndiscriminate.\n  That is why, last February, the U.S. Surgeon General, Richard \nCarmona, again issued another advisory, to protect women, to completely \nabstain from alcohol use.\n  In Alaska, we have very troubling statistics as they relate to FASD. \nWe have the highest rate of FASD in the Nation. Approximately 163 \nAlaskan babies are born each year affected by maternal alcohol use \nduring pregnancy. Among our Native communities, the statistics are even \nworse. The rate of FASD is 15 times higher than non-Native areas in our \nState.\n  This is a disease syndrome that is 100 percent preventable. We can \nsave so many children, so many families, so much heartache simply by \nincreasing people's awareness of what FASD is and how we can prevent \nit.\n  In fact, prevention of FASD is seven times more cost effective than \ntreating the disorder. That is why Senator Johnson and I and several \nother Senators from both sides of the aisle will soon introduce \nlegislation to direct more resources toward this terrible problem. The \nlegislation we are introducing is called the Advancing FASD Research, \nPrevention and Services Act. It is designed to develop and implement \ntargeted State and community-based outreach programs to improve \ncoordination among Federal agencies involved in FASD treatment and \nresearch by establishing stronger communication with these programs and \nalso to improve support services for families and strengthening \neducational outreach efforts to doctors, teachers, judges, and others \nwhose work puts them in contact with those with FASD.\n  Mr. President, 40,000 American children a year are born with FASD. \nOur investment today in prevention, treatment, and research will save \ncountless and future health care costs of this devastating, but \nentirely preventable, disorder.\n  I ask my colleagues to join with Senator Johnson and I in supporting \nthe advancing FASD Research, Prevention and Services Act.\n  Today, on Fetal Alcohol Awareness Day, let us remember all innocent \nbabies afflicted with this disorder and let us imagine the potential \nthey could have but for this damage from alcohol. I hope we continue to \nrecognize, to pause in the ninth hour of the ninth day of each \nSeptember until fetal alcohol syndrome disorders are eradicated.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on Monday, the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations bill. \nThere are a number of amendments pending or in order to the bill, and I \nencourage Members to offer and debate those amendments on Monday \nafternoon so we can schedule votes for Monday night and Tuesday.\n  On Monday evening, at 5:30, we will have an hour of debate followed \nby a vote on the motion to proceed to S.J. Res. 20, a resolution of \ndisapproval relating to mercury. That vote will occur at 6:30 p.m., and \nadditional votes are possible into the evening.\n  Early next week, we expect to finish the Commerce-Justice-Science \nappropriations bill, and we will continue with other appropriations \nmeasures over the course of that week. Many of these appropriations \nbills do have disaster-related language, language that is important to \nour response to Katrina; therefore, we want to expedite their \nconsideration.\n  We have been working to pass several freestanding measures in \nresponse to Katrina, and we will continue to do so as they become \navailable. As I pointed out earlier this morning and yesterday, last \nnight, we are working very aggressively to make sure all legislation \nwhich is of benefit to the victims of this hurricane are handled \nexpeditiously on the floor of the Senate in their consideration and \npassage.\n  We have considered two emergency supplemental bills: the $51.8 \nbillion we passed last night and the $10.5 billion we passed on \nThursday of a week ago. We have considered bills regarding emergency \ncourt jurisdiction in response to Katrina and the courts' ability to \ncontinue their operations along the southern coast. We considered a \nresolution allowing for Senate offices to assist with noncash \ncontributions with regard to relief in response to the hurricane.\n  We are currently working on a whole range of additional matters \nrelating to flood insurance and TANF, which is the Temporary Assistance \nto Needy Families Program. Our committees, through their various \njurisdictions, are working to see how and when we can take action to \ngive that appropriate relief and make progress in helping all of those \naffected by this natural disaster. We will continue those efforts over \nthe weekend and into next week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/09/senate-section/article/S9891-3", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
