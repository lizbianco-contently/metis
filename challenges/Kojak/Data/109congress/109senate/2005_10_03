Mr. President, today we are turning to consideration of \nthe Department of Defense appropriations bill. Chairman Stevens and \nSenator Inouye are ready for Senators to come forward with their \namendments. We hope to have an agreement that all first-degree \namendments will be filed at the desk no later than 5 p.m. today. The \nDemocrat leader and I were just talking to that effect, and we will \ncontinue to work for the next several minutes on that.\n  This would enable the two managers to review--and this is very \nimportant--allow them to review the legislative language to see what \namendments may be acceptable on both sides. We have been unable to lock \nthat agreement in place at this time, but I will continue to talk with \nthe Democrat leader to see if that would be possible.\n  As I previously announced, there will be no rollcall votes today or \ntomorrow in observance of the Rosh Hashanah holiday. Any votes ordered \ntoday or tomorrow will occur at sundown on Wednesday. In all \nlikelihood, we will be stacking votes at that time.\n  Having said that, we will be in discussion during this period, so \nMembers can come forward and offer their amendments. I encourage \nMembers to come to the Senate and not wait until later in the week. We \nare going to finish this bill before our next recess. We are making \nreal progress on the appropriations bills. We need to continue that \nprocess. As we all know, the fiscal year has just passed. We are \nworking on a continuing resolution. It is critical we continue to make \nprogress on these bills. We have Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, \nand Friday of this week to complete the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill. I hope we will be able to finish it Wednesday or \nThursday, but we are not going to leave until we complete this bill.\n  A number of other pieces of very important legislation are being \ndiscussed, debated, talked about, and written. One of those is the \npensions legislation. The Committee on Finance and Committee on HELP \nhave a bipartisan package on which we expect to reach a unanimous \nconsent agreement so we can consider that bill this week as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/03/senate-section/article/S10813-7", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10813-S10814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF HARRIET MIERS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this is a momentous day in the history of \nour Nation. For the first time in two decades, a new Chief Justice \nascends to the bench of the highest Court in the land. Today, John \nRoberts is leading the Supreme Court as the 17th Chief Justice of the \nUnited States. And today, with the nomination of Harriet Miers as an \nAssociate Justice of the Supreme Court, we are faced with yet another \nopportunity to shape the course of history.\n  President Bush's choice of Harriet Miers demonstrated a thoughtful, \ncareful, and discerning selection. Once again, the President reached \nout in a bipartisan way to more than 80 Senators. Once again, the \nPresident chose a qualified nominee for our High Court.\n  During her distinguished 35-year legal career, Ms. Miers has \ndemonstrated her expertise as a talented attorney in both private \npractice and in public service. In every sense, Harriet Miers has been \na true trailblazer and a role model for women in the legal profession.\n  As a young attorney, she overcame numerous obstacles to become the \nfirst female hired by her Dallas law firm. She impressed her colleagues \nso much that they elected her president of the firm, making her the \nfirst woman to lead a Texas firm of that size.\n  Ms. Miers has been a pillar of leadership in the legal community. She \nwas the first female elected president of the Dallas Bar Association \nand head of the State Bar of Texas. She has served as trusted adviser \nto President Bush in various capacities and currently serves as White \nHouse Counsel.\n  Since she has not served as a judge, she will bring a unique \nperspective to\n\n[[Page S10814]]\n\nthe Court. In fact, 41 of the 109 Supreme Court Justices who have \nserved, including Chief Justice Rehnquist, did not have prior judicial \nexperience.\n\n  What the President saw in Ms. Miers and what I see in her is that she \nembodies each of the qualities we seek in a Supreme Court Justice. She \nis fair, honest, and of the highest integrity. Her resume is a study in \nthe time-honored values of hard work and perseverance. She understands \nthe importance of judicial restraint and the limited role of the judge \nto interpret the law and not legislate from the bench.\n  She deserves a fair and civil hearing and a dignified debate on the \nSenate floor, followed by a fair up-or-down vote before Thanksgiving.\n  As we move ahead with the nomination process, I hope we will carry \nforward the lessons we have learned from Chief Justice Roberts' recent \nnomination. His nomination progressed expeditiously and in a bipartisan \nmanner. I commend Chairman Specter, Ranking Member Leahy, the Judiciary \nCommittee, and the entire Senate for setting a standard to follow. We \nput principle above partisanship. We put results above rhetoric. We \nfollowed the framework intended by the Framers of the Constitution. By \ndoing this, we helped to preserve the integrity and legitimacy of the \njudicial nomination process. And today, our Supreme Court and our \nFederal judiciary are stronger for it.\n  From the Roberts confirmation we have learned and a bipartisan group \nof Senators agree that Senators can make an informed decision on the \nfitness of a judicial nominee by focusing on the individual's \nqualifications and not her political ideology. We have learned that a \nnominee's fitness to serve on the Federal bench can be determined by \nreviewing her record, her writings, and testimony, without probing into \nconfidential, privileged documents. We have learned that nominees can \nand should answer questions without compromising their judicial \nindependence and without prejudging cases, and we should not expect \nthem to prejudge cases or issues that may come before the Court. A \nnominee who prejudges is truthfully the antithesis of what we want in a \njudge. We want an individual who approaches every case with a fair and \nopen mind, analyzing the facts before them and applying the law. \nPerhaps the most important lesson we have learned from Chief Justice \nRoberts' nomination is that we should apply a single fair standard to \nall judicial nominees.\n  With Harriet Miers' nomination before the Senate, we must again move \nexpeditiously but carefully. It is my expectation that the Senate will \ngive Ms. Miers the fair and civil hearing, the dignified debate, and \nthe fair up-or-down vote she deserves. I believe the Senate has moved \nbeyond the obstructionism of the recent past, and in moving forward we \nwill adhere to the time-honored principle that all judicial nominees \ndeserve a fair up-or-down vote. That vote should occur by Thanksgiving. \nWith civility, trust, and hard work, we can accomplish this goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/03/senate-section/article/S10814-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10814-S10818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2006\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 2863, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2863) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2006, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Warner are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  (The remarks of Mr. Warner pertaining to the introduction of S. 1810 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: It is my \nunderstanding we are on the bill for appropriations for our defense \npurposes under the management of the distinguished Presiding Officer. \nAm I correct?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct, the Defense \nappropriations bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this is a matter that I have discussed \nwith the managers of the bill as well as, on several occasions, our \ndistinguished Republican and Democratic leaders. On behalf of Senator \nLevin and myself, I file today the 2006 authorization bill which has \nbeen prepared by the Committee on Armed Services. It was taken up by \nthe Senate some weeks ago but, due to schedule pressures, we did not \nhave the opportunity to finish that bill.\n  I emphasize that Senator Levin and I jointly are taking this action \ntoday. We do so having also worked very conscientiously with our two \nleaders to prepare a unanimous consent request, which is still in the \nworks, by which our bill can once again be brought up as a freestanding \nmeasure and the Senate act upon it. I will not dwell at this time on \nthe various options we are discussing as to how that UC is drawn up. \nSenator Levin and I believe that it is imperative, on behalf of the men \nand women of the Armed Forces, that this bill be considered in a timely \nfashion. As we continue our work on the UC, I have to seize upon this \nopportunity, together with Senator Levin, to file our bill as a \nproposed amendment to the appropriations bill, together with a \nmanagers' package, a proposed managers' amendment, of some 80 \namendments that Senator Levin, since the time of the original \nconsideration of our bill, and I have looked at, agreed, and would be \nseeking unanimous consent for the incorporation of those amendments in \nour bill.\n  The armed services bill was acted on with some 31 amendments at the \ntime it was on the floor. So we have the original bill with 31 \namendments which were agreed to in the course of several days of \ndeliberation. Again, the Defense authorization act is too important to \nour soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines, and the national security \nof our country for the Senate not to complete action on it. If we \ncannot achieve unanimous consent prior to the final passage of this \nbill, it is the intent of Senator Levin and myself to urge upon the \nSenate the incorporation of the Defense authorization bill, together \nwith at least a first managers' package of 80 amendments. For the \nconvenience of Senators, I ask unanimous consent that a list of those \n80 amendments and a brief description and the Senators, some 68 in \nnumber, who are affected by this managers' package, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n PROPOSED MANAGER'S AMENDMENT FOR THE FY 2006 DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     No.            Senator             Subject            Comments\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1...........

By way of historical context, I would like to point out \nthe following: There is an unbroken record for the last 45 years of \nSenate history that the Senate has passed an annual Defense \nauthorization bill. The Senate and House have come to a conference \nagreement on and the President has signed that conference into law as \nthe National Defense Authorization Act. Only once before has the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee had to resort to the rare \nparliamentary procedure of proposing that that bill, the entire Defense \nauthorization bill, be placed upon another legislative matter. That was \nin the year 1988.\n  Time is short. We must be reasonable in the amount of time we have \nbeen debating both the authorization bill and the appropriations bill. \nI ask for my colleagues' consideration and restraint in offering \namendments to the appropriations bill, as well as to the authorization \nbill, hopefully, to achieve the unanimous consent agreement, which I \nhope will be offered in the next few days, to enable the authorization \nbill to become a freestanding bill with a designated number of \namendments, with designated time agreements, and a clear estimate for \nboth the Republican and Democratic leaders as to the number of days \nthat would be required for completion. That will all be set forth, \nhopefully, in the next few days in a UC request.\n  We must be aware of the importance of the measure, the authorization \nbill. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, \nguardsmen, Active Reserve and National Guard, and countless civilians \nwho support military, diplomatic, and humanitarian operations are \nserving valiantly in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other locations to secure \nour national security. This bill would provide them a broad range, \nliterally a million-plus individuals in uniform and civilians, with \nbetter equipment to do their daily jobs and enhanced quality of life \nfor themselves and their families through pay raises and benefits and \nthe like.\n  For example, without this bill being acted upon by the Senate, we \ncould not increase the death gratuity to $100,000, which the Senate \nstrongly desires, for survivors of military members whose death \nresulted from wounds, injuries, or illnesses incurred under combat-\nrelated conditions or in a combat operation or a combat zone. We could \nnot increase TRICARE benefits for the children of survivors. We could \nnot provide the military services with the authorities for bonuses and \nother incentives needed to meet the troublesome recruiting situation \ntoday. We could not implement new assistance to school districts with \nsignificant enrollment increases in military-dependent students to stop \ntroop relocations, creation of new units, and realignments under the \nBRAC Commission and, above all, the annual pay raises which the \nCongress provides for the men and women.\n  In addition to the above, the threat reduction program, which is \ndesigned to keep nuclear materials and expertise away from terrorists, \nwould expire. Weapons systems costs would increase\n\n[[Page S10816]]\n\nbecause multiyear procurement authorities would not be enacted. Special \nacquisition authorities designed to facilitate the rapid procurement of \ntechnologies to prevent casualties from terrorist roadside bombs, or \nIEDs, would fail to go into effect. Military construction and family \nhousing programs would be jeopardized, including over $1.5 billion to \nfund projects in support of communities that will be affected by the \n2005 BRAC round, if that is eventually becoming law. These are a few of \nthe essential authorities contained in the legislative provisions of \nthis year's bill, something that I am proud to say the Senate Armed \nServices Committee has worked on since January of this year and \nresulted in 278 legislative provisions as contained in this bill.\n  I respectfully ask my colleagues to support my efforts and that of \nSenator Levin in bringing the Defense authorization bill to the floor.\n  As I said, I rise on behalf of myself and Senator Levin to announce \nthat we have taken what I consider extraordinary action by filing two \namendments to the pending bill. It is with great reluctance that I \npropose these amendments to the Defense Appropriations Act. But I do so \nonly with the interests of the men and women of our armed forces at \nheart.\n  The first amendment consists of the National Defense Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2006--including not only the version of the bill \nunanimously reported out of the Armed Services Committee on May 17, but \nalso 31 amendments added to the bill when it was on the floor in July.\n  Senator Levin and I, with our respective leaders, are trying to work \nout a unanimous consent agreement that would return the Defense \nauthorization bill to the floor as a stand-alone bill. However, in the \nabsence of that agreement, we have to leave open the option of \nincluding this bill on another legislative vehicle. The Defense \nauthorization act is just too important to our soldiers, sailors, \nairmen and Marines and the national security of our country for the \nSenate not to complete action on the bill. If we cannot do this as a \nstand-alone bill, we need to find another way to bring this bill into \nlaw.\n  The second amendment we are offering today contains additional \namendments that are agreed and ready to be included in a ``managers' \npackage'' to the Defense authorization act. I offer this amendment to \nillustrate to my colleagues the significant progress that has been made \non this bill so far. This new managers' package contains 80 amendments \non behalf of 67 Senators. Together with the action already taken on \nthis bill in July, our colleagues can clearly see that nearly every \nU.S. Senator has made an important contribution to the Defense \nauthorization act.\n  I am committed to making this ``managers' package'' the first \namendment to be considered to the Defense authorization bill once it is \ntaken up as a separate bill. We are not finished reviewing proposed \namendments. The committee is still working through a number of \namendments that I expect would be included in a second managers' \npackage.\n  Since January 1961, the Senate has passed an annual Defense \nauthorization bill. Each and every year, for 45 years, the Senate and \nthe House have come to a conference agreement on and the President has \nsigned into law a National Defense Authorization Act. Only once before \nhas the chairman of the Armed Services Committee had to resort to the \nrare parliamentary procedure of proposing to put the entire defense \nauthorization bill on another bill. This occurred in 1988. As the \ncustodian of this important piece of legislation, I find I am left with \nvery few options this year to ensure Congress can adequately support \nour troops by passing this bill.\n  I, with my friend Carl Levin, am willing to do whatever it takes to \npass this bill. Time is short and we must be reasonable in the amount \nof time we spend debating this bill. I ask for my colleagues' \nconsideration and restraint in offering additional amendments to this \nbill and to support a unanimous consent agreement to limit the number \nof contentious amendments that may require time to debate on the floor. \nAt the same time, Senator Levin and I pledge to work with Senators to \naccept as many amendments as possible in a managers' package.\n  Our responsibility to consider and pass the Defense authorization \nbill goes beyond statutory requirements, floor schedules, and \nhistorical precedent. We must also be aware of the importance of this \nmeasure to our men and women in uniform around the world. Hundreds of \nthousands of soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen--\nactive, reserve, and National Guard--and, countless civilians who \nsupport military, diplomatic and humanitarian operations are serving \nvaliantly in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other locations to secure hard-won \nmilitary successes and to preserve peace and freedom. This bill will \nprovide them with better equipment to do their daily jobs, and an \nenhanced quality of life for themselves and their families. Together we \ncan and must complete this bill for them.\n  Without this bill, DoD could not, for example, increase the death \ngratuity to $100,000 for survivors of military members whose death \nresulted from wounds, injuries, or illnesses incurred under combat-\nrelated conditions or in a combat operation or a combat zone; increase \nTRICARE benefits for the children of survivors; provide the military \nservices the authorities and pays needed to enhance recruitment and \nretention in the active and reserve forces; and implement new \nassistance to school districts with significant enrollment increases in \nmilitary dependent students due to troop relocations, creation of new \nunits and realignments under BRAC.\n  In addition, authorities related to the Cooperative Threat Reduction \nProgram which is designed to keep nuclear materials and expertise away \nfrom terrorists would expire. Weapon systems costs would increase \nbecause multiyear procurement authorities would not be enacted. Special \nacquisition authorities designed to facilitate the rapid procurement of \ntechnologies to prevent casualties from terrorist roadside bombs or \nIEDs would not go into effect. Military construction and family housing \nprograms would be jeopardized, including over $1.5 billion to fund \nprojects in support of the 2005 BRAC round.\n  These are just a few of the essential authorities contained in the \n278 legislative provisions in this year's bill.\n  So I ask my colleagues to support Senator Levin's and my efforts to \nbring the Defense authorization bill to the floor. We are all mindful \nof the risks members of the U.S. Armed Forces face every day and of the \nsacrifices made by the families and communities that support them. Our \nmen and women in uniform have been asked to do much in the past year, \nand they have responded in the finest traditions of the generations of \nAmericans that preceded them. The American people are proud of their \nArmed Forces for what they have accomplished, and for the manner in \nwhich they represent American values and the generosity of America. It \nis time for us in the Senate to do our part.\n  With the understanding that the two bills are filed, I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn.) The amendments will be filed for \nthe Record.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I join the Chairman of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee in filing the National Defense Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 2006, as an amendment to this bill. I also join the \nchairman in filing a managers' amendment incorporating many of the \namendments that Members are offering to our bill. We and our staffs are \nworking hard, and hope to clear more amendments as we move forward.\n  This is not our preferred approach to this issue. We have always \nbrought up and completed action on the Defense authorization bill as a \nfreestanding bill in the past, and we would prefer to do so this year. \nIndeed, we have made and are continuing to make every effort to do so. \nI remain optimistic that we will be able to reach agreement to proceed \nto and complete action on the Defense authorization bill and that it \nwill not be necessary to take up this amendment.\n  This bill was unanimously reported out of the Armed Services \nCommittee all the way back in May. It was brought to the Senate floor 2 \nmonths later, at the end of July. In the last week before the August \nrecess, we attempted to enter a unanimous consent agreement which would \nhave concluded debate on the bill in less that 2 days.\n\n[[Page S10817]]\n\nUnfortunately, the Republican leadership rejected this proposal and \npulled the bill off the floor before action could be completed, so that \nthe Senate could instead consider the gun manufacturers' liability \nbill.\n  Since that time, we have made every effort to bring the bill back up \nas a freestanding measure, but without success. We have repeatedly \nasked the Republican leadership for floor time. We have offered to \nenter into agreements regarding the relevance of amendments, and the \nnumber of amendments, so as to limit the amount of time that would be \ntaken by debate. So far, none of these efforts have borne fruit.\n  Mr. President, more than 4 months have now passed since this bill was \nreported out of the Armed Services Committee. The fiscal year covered \nby the bill began last week. The Senate truly needs to consider this \nbill, and if bringing it to the floor as an amendment is the only way \nto get that consideration, we have an obligation to try.\n  At a time when members of our Armed Forces are performing heroically, \nboth at home and overseas, to make our country safer and stronger, our \nmilitary both needs and deserves all of the support that this Congress \ncan provide. More than 70,000 active duty and National Guard troops \nhave been sent to the gulf coast to assist in the recovery from \nHurricane Katrina. These troops are playing a critical role in \nconducting search and rescue missions, evacuating displaced persons, \nproviding security in impacted areas, delivering essential food, water \nand medicine, and rebuilding damaged infrastructure throughout the \nregion.\n  At the same time, roughly 138,000 U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen and \nmarines are engaged in taking on an aggressive insurgency in Iraq, \nanother 17,000 remain in harm's way in Afghanistan, and tens of \nthousands more are supporting the war effort through deployments \nthousands of miles from home. Our Armed Forces also continue to bear \nthe brunt of the continuing effort to keep the peace in Kosovo and the \nSinai, and contain the threat of North Korea--while remaining prepared \nto execute other missions in support of the national military strategy.\n  Some of these troops deployed overseas are from the gulf coast area. \nSome will soon return home to find that Katrina has damaged or \ndestroyed their homes. Some will have nothing left. Passage of the \nnational Defense bill will improve their quality of life while they \nremain on active duty and when serving on hurricane recovery duty. It \nwill send an important message to them and to their families that we, \nas a nation, understand their loss and appreciate their service. \nFailure to pass the Defense bill would send the opposite message.\n  At a time when members of our Armed Forces are performing heroically, \nboth at home and overseas, to make our country safer and stronger, it \nwould be unconscionable to give the Defense authorization bill less \nthan top legislative priority. Our military both needs and deserves all \nof the support that this Congress can provide.\n  First and foremost, the Defense authorization bill would support our \ntroops by improving compensation and quality of life for our service \nmen and women and their families as they face the hardships imposed by \ncontinuing military operations within the United States and around the \nworld. For instance, the bill would provide funding for a 3.1 percent \nacross-the-board pay raise for military personnel; a $70 million \nincrease in childcare and family assistance services for military \nfamilies; and $50 million in supplemental educational aid to local \nschool districts affected by the assignment or location of military \nfamilies.\n\n  The bill would also provide needed funding for the continuation of \nour military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. For example, the bill \nwould authorize a $50 billion supplemental for continued operations in \nIraq and Afghanistan, add hundreds of millions of dollars to the \nPresident's budget needed for force protection gear, up-armored \nvehicles, and a Joint Improvised Explosive Device Task Force, increase \nthe Army's active-duty end strength by 20,000, and authorize the \ncontinuation of the Commanders' Emergency Response Program.\n  If we fail to enact this bill in a timely manner, we will hurt our \nmen and women in uniform. The military's authority to pay bonuses and \nspecial pays to our men and women in uniform would expire, exacerbating \nan already troublesome problem we are facing with recruitment and \nretention. The enhanced death gratuity of $100,000 and the increased \nlife insurance benefits that we enacted for servicemembers earlier this \nyear would lapse and substantially lower benefits would be reinstated. \nMore than $6.0 billion in military construction and family housing \nprojects to improve the conditions in which our servicemembers work and \nlive would be unable to proceed.\n  The Senate obviously has a lengthy agenda for the rest of the year. \nSome of the items on this agenda are undoubtedly important, but we \nshould not pursue them at the expense of our men and women in uniform. \nIf we truly value the contribution that our Armed Forces have made and \ncontinue to make every day at home and abroad, we should take up and \npass a Defense authorization bill--preferably as a freestanding bill \nbut, if not, as an amendment to the pending legislation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator from Hawaii and I understand \nfull well the problems facing the chairman and ranking member of the \nArmed Services Committee. We want to work with them to the maximum \nextent possible. However, as we have informed the chairman, the Senator \nfrom Virginia, we feel that bringing that bill here without a time \nagreement, to call it up without a time agreement, would mean that we \nwould face some 100 to 200 amendments, as the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Armed Services Committee have faced in the past. In my \nconversations with Department of Defense officials, particularly the \nuniformed members of that Department, it is clear that we must have \nthis bill to the President and signed before the middle of November. \nThe Appropriations Committee had a series of reprogramming of 2006 \nmoneys, done just before September 30, to assure that liquidity was \nthere to maintain our forces in the field. Under the continuing \nresolution, we have no such flexibility now.\n  The flexibility that comes from having a full year's bill out in \nfront of the Department is absolutely necessary at this time. We are at \nwar. We are involved in a global war on terror. If anyone heard General \nAbizaid's briefing for us and the one that was done publicly, we have \nto realize that we are facing what looks like the beginning of a new \ncrusade by militant terrorists of the Islamic world. We cannot afford \nto delay this bill.\n  I say to my good friend--and it is not just a word of art here on the \nfloor; we have been friends for many years--we cannot take on this \nburden unless we get a time agreement. The Senator's bill, as an \namendment to our bill, is subject to a point of order. We will not \nraise that point of order because it should be before us. And the \nSenate should know it is possible to complete both of these bills by \nFriday, if we would work together. But we need to complete this bill by \nFriday in order that when we are not in session, due to the holidays of \nthe following week, our staffs can pull together the conference report \ndocuments and be ready to go to conference when we come back on October \n17 or 18 of this month. It will take some time to conference just the \nAppropriations subcommittee bill. I am certain it will take substantial \ntime to conference the Armed Services bill in conference.\n  What worries me is, if that Armed Services bill becomes part of our \nconference, then we have an extremely difficult time if the House and \nSenate Armed Services Committee cannot complete their conferences in \nthe same period of time that we would complete the conference on the \nappropriations bill. But we are all in this together. We know that \nthere are provisions in the appropriations bill that require \nauthorization. A substantial part do not. A substantial part are under \ngeneral authority of appropriations for people in the field, for the \narmed services and for the operation and maintenance items that are in \nthe bill and also those that are involved with continuing \nauthorizations for various types of acquisitions and equipment.\n  We look forward to working with the Senator from Virginia. He does an \nexcellent job as chairman of the Armed Services Committee. We are \ndelighted that he is pressing hard for his bill because it is \nnecessary. For instance, the\n\n[[Page S10818]]\n\nsize of the pay raise, the size of the COLA, the size of various \nadjustments made between the various functions of the Department, all \nare necessary.\n  The annual items in this bill require authorization. Those that are a \ncontinuing part of defense operations, we can and should fund, \nnotwithstanding the Armed Services bill might not have passed by the \ntime we get this bill to the President to sign.\n  Above all, money for Afghanistan and Iraq is a supplemental attached \nto our bill. It is within our bill. It is $50 billion that is \nabsolutely necessary to continue our operations there at a very \ncritical time with the election coming up over there to approve their \nconstitution and then, following that, the election of their officials. \nWe have had to send additional people over there--not as many as we did \nfor the first election over there, but there has been a flow of people \nover there. That money will come out of the $50 billion that is in this \nbill for operations for the future in regard to Iraq and Afghanistan \nand that portion of the war on terror.\n  I do believe the Senator from Virginia understands our situation.\n  Does the Senator from Hawaii wish to make any comments? I think we \nare in agreement on this position. We welcome the Senators' initiative \nand hope it works.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there are no two individuals in the Senate \ntoday that have a finer reputation for Senatorial courtesy and for the \nneed for our national defense legislation than the two managers of the \nappropriations bill, the Senators from Alaska and Hawaii, both of whom \nhave had such distinguished careers in the uniform of the country in \nwhich we all take such pride.\n\n  Both of these individuals have conferred with my colleague, Senator \nLevin, and with me about the measures I have taken today. Senator \nStevens very carefully pointed out to me exactly what he has said--his \ngrave concern, understandable concern, and proper concern about the \nimperative need of the passage of the appropriations bill. In no way is \nit the intention of this Senator or Senator Levin to try to unduly \ndelay that bill.\n  We will see whether a time agreement is achievable, either for \nconsideration of our bill for a brief period of time, on the \nappropriations bill, or by virtue of a UC as a freestanding bill. I \nurge we try and do it on this bill.\n  The Senator pointed out the exigencies of conferences. In my \nresearch, there are several options on how to conduct a conference on \nthese two bills. I am sure we can work out a method to do so. For \nexample, it may be possible to split off the authorization bill prior \nto final passage of the appropriations bill in order to facilitate two \nseparate conference reports. If that is not possible, the chairman of \nthe subcommittee on appropriations could decide to hold what would be \nbasically two conferences--one of the authorizers, one of the \nappropriators. But nevertheless, the appropriators would have overall \ncontrol and only one conference report would be voted on by the Senate. \nI think either of these options could be achieved here. Certainly, I \nknow Senator Levin and I would work to these ends. But I also bring to \nthe attention of the managers, we all know full well there are several \namendments--I shall not try to characterize them other than to say \nthere are several amendments that are to be brought against the \nauthorization bill which, I am inclined to believe, will be brought \nagainst the appropriations bill should we not move ahead with the \nauthorization bill so those amendments can be authorized on this bill.\n  There is a strong conviction among a number of my colleagues--I don't \nagree, but I respect them--to have a commission to study how this \ncountry deals with its detainees and other commissions that are in the \nminds of others.\n  I don't think, unless there is clarity as to what is going to happen \nto the authorization bill, that you can rule out the possibility that \none or more of these amendments might be directed in the next few days \nagainst this bill, with the best of intentions, and those would be \ntime-consuming matters, I assume.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield, Mr. President?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, of course.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is not for a question but for a statement.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator from Hawaii and I \nhave opposed filing cloture on the Defense appropriations bill in the \npast. It has not been necessary. As a matter of fact, in the past \nyears, this bill has taken from 3 to 5 hours on the floor because it is \na bipartisan bill. It is a bill that comes out of our subcommittee and \nthe full Committee on Appropriations unanimously. Our staffs work \ntirelessly to make sure we cover every single possible objection or \nconcern.\n\n  But this year, it appears to me, because of the timeframe I have \nmentioned, I am constrained to consult with my friend from Hawaii to \nseek the filing of cloture on Wednesday because if we do not vote by \nFriday, we are going to be into November before we even get this bill \noff the floor. We just cannot do that now.\n  I hope the Armed Services Committee members and all those who have \namendments will keep in mind the timeframe. The way these holidays are \ncoming at us, and because of the schedule, we must get this bill to the \nHouse for conference before the first of November. It is going to be \nvery difficult to do unless we finish the bill by October 7.\n  I want the Senate to know, despite a longstanding policy of opposing \ncloture on the Defense bill, the timeframe that is involved in the \nconsideration of this bill now, because of many things that are not \nunder the control of anybody--two vacancies on the Supreme Court and \nvarious other matters that we have taken up that have taken prolonged \ntime on the floor--we are very late in considering this bill.\n  I know the Senate understands the problem of funding when we have men \nand women who are overseas, particularly in a time of war. There is no \nway we can possibly consider taking off on Friday and not coming back \nuntil a week from the following Monday if this bill has not been \npassed. I urge the Senator to keep that in mind.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/03/senate-section/article/S10818-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a proud \nKentuckian, community leader, and good friend, Mrs. Cornelia ``Neal'' \nVaughan. Neal, like her uncle, the late Senator John Sherman Cooper, is \nsincerely dedicated to improving the lives of Kentuckians, and she does \nso\n\n[[Page S10819]]\n\nthrough her extensive volunteer work. Neal is a founding member of the \nFayette County Drug Court and served on the National Association of \nDrug Court Professionals Board of Directors. She has worked with the \nJunior League, God's Closet, the Governors Inauguration Committee, the \nSayre School Board, and the Hope Center for Women. Neal is also on the \nboard for the Kentucky Governor's School for the Arts, but her greatest \naccomplishments lie in her role as president of the board of directors \nfor the Chrysalis Community Center in Lexington, KY.\n  The center assists women recovering from substance abuse addiction \nand counsels the children of these women on substance abuse prevention. \nChrysalis uses a combination of the 12-step program originated by \nAlcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous, long-term living \narrangements, and a caring and nurturing environment to ensure women \nand their families live fulfilling lives free of abusive substances. On \nFriday, September 23, 2005 the center recognized Neal for the vital \nrole she has played in its expansion by dedicating the center's \ncommunity center in her honor. Neal has given her all to the center's \nimportant mission: restoring hope and dignity in women's lives.\n  On September 21 of this year, The Lexington Herald-Leader published \nan article highlighting the Chrysalis Center's success and Neal's \ncontribution. I ask that the full article be included in the \nCongressional Record.\n\n           [From the Lexington Herald-Leader, Sept. 21, 2005]\n\n                Chrysalis, the House That Neal Built Up\n\n                           (By Robin Roenker)\n\n       A mural of brightly colored butterflies accentuates the \n     sky-blue walls of the entry to Lexington's Chrysalis \n     Community Center.\n       It's the type of room that makes you feel better just by \n     entering it. A room that says, you're welcome here. This is a \n     safe place to be.\n       And to the women who use Chrysalis House's services--women \n     who are recovering from substance addiction--it says \n     something else. A message many of them have not heard often \n     enough: ``You're a good person. You deserve treatment with \n     dignity.''\n       For two decades, that message has been the motivating theme \n     behind Cornelia ``Neal'' Vaughan's volunteer work with \n     Chrysalis House.\n       As president of the agency's board of directors for 16 of \n     the past 18 years, Vaughan has overseen Chrysalis House's \n     growth from a single, 12-person-capacity facility on Maxwell \n     Street for women recovering from substance addiction into a \n     multi-faceted agency with three transitional treatment \n     facilities, 50 apartments, an 18,000-square-foot community \n     center and programs to help place graduates in their own \n     permanent housing. Currently, Chrysalis House's six \n     facilities are home to 114 women and 100 children, with 160 \n     more women on waiting lists.\n       Vaughan, who will be honored at a ceremony Friday, can \n     detail every step of Chrysalis House's development.\n       She can detail them because she was there, say her fellow \n     Chrysalis House board members, every step of the way. Raising \n     money. Submitting grant proposals. Identifying facility \n     sites. Recognizing the women's needs and finding partners in \n     the community to help meet them.\n       But not only that. Despite her penchant for wearing pearls \n     and high heels, she was also there to clean out shower \n     stalls, pull weeds from the grounds and serve food in the \n     dinner line, said Lisa Minton, Chrysalis House's executive \n     director.\n       ``She is the heart and soul of our organization,'' Minton \n     said.\n       ``Neal has been very inspirational in her vision,'' added \n     Julie Hamilton, who assumed Vaughan's position as president \n     of the Chrysalis House board of directors in July. ``She's \n     the first to say that this is all about the women and \n     children. And her passion has been very contagious.''\n       To recognize Vaughan's longstanding leadership and \n     volunteer work on behalf of women and children in the \n     community, the Chrysalis House board of directors is \n     dedicating the Chrysalis Community Center, which opened in \n     2003 on the house's new eight-acre campus on Hill Rise Drive \n     off Versailles Road, in honor of Vaughan.\n       A plaque will be hung in Vaughan's honor. Speakers will \n     include Kentucky first lady Glenna Fletcher and Beverly Watts \n     Davis, director of the U.S. Department for Health and Human \n     Services Center for Substance Abuse Prevention.\n\n\n                            No good vs. bad\n\n       ``With substance abuse, it is not a good or bad issue,'' \n     said Vaughan, 57. ``It is a sick or well issue.''\n       That philosophy motivates the program's holistic approach \n     to treating the women who come to Chrysalis House. The women \n     receive addiction treatment as well as help with reclaiming \n     their lives, jobs and families.\n       When Chrysalis House first opened, ``women were coming in \n     and getting sober, but they had so many other issues,'' \n     Vaughan said.\n       ``I realized that even though they were staying in our \n     facility for 10 months or a year, they were leaving without \n     parenting skills or a job,'' she said. ``If you're going to \n     rehabilitate someone, you have to really rehabilitate them. \n     You need to find the gaps where they need help, and help them \n     fill those in.''\n       Now, participants take part in required job skills classes \n     and work one-on-one with tutors and counselors during their \n     stay, so that when they leave Chrysalis House, they're ready \n     to ``pick up their lives, and have a productive life they \n     feel good about,'' she said.\n       Studies of Chrysalis House participants show that 80 \n     percent are still sober, still have custody of their \n     children, and are still employed a year after they moved out \n     of the apartments, Vaughan said.\n\n\n                          Doesn't take ``no''\n\n       Much of the credit for Chrysalis House's growth goes to \n     Vaughan's tenacity in raising support for its programs and \n     educating the community to ``break down the stigma \n     surrounding substance addiction,'' Hamilton said.\n       ``She helped open community doors to a better understanding \n     of the disease of addiction itself,'' she said. ``Plus, she's \n     the type of person you can't say `no' to. She never gives \n     up.''\n       In addition to her work with Chrysalis House, Vaughan is a \n     founding member of the Fayette County Drug Court. She serves \n     on the board of the Governor's School for the Arts and has \n     fulfilled another of her passions--organizing big events--\n     through work with the Governor's Inauguration Committee and \n     the Lexington Ball, which supports the University of Kentucky \n     Markey Cancer Center. She was recently appointed to the \n     national board of the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention.\n       Vaughan attributes her passion for community service to the \n     example set by her parents, Richard and Cornelia Cooper of \n     Somerset, who remain active volunteers. She credits her \n     longevity as board president to the support and understanding \n     of her sons Cooper and Stoll, and her husband, Derek, \n     chairman of G.F. Vaughan Tobacco Company.\n       Two years ago when Derek asked her what she wanted for \n     their 30th wedding anniversary, he wasn't surprised by her \n     answer: All new furniture for the First Step House on \n     Chrysalis Court.\n       That is what she got--along with a new strand of pearls.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/03/senate-section/article/S10819-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10819-S10820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO OFFICER LONNIE TABRON\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to make a floor statement on behalf \nof a member of our Senate family.\n  I, like so many other Senators, come into a particular entrance here \nin the Senate as I drive in in the morning.\n  I rise today to pay tribute to Officer Lonnie Tabron. Officer Tabron \nretired from the Capitol Police on Saturday, October 1, 2005, having \ncompleted 22 years of distinguished service since his first day on the \nforce, May 4, 1983.\n  Lonnie Tabron was born in Washington, DC, in July 1949, and he \nreceived his education in the District's public school system, where he \nalways strived for excellence. After graduating from high school, \nLonnie served the United States of America in the Armed Forces in \nVietnam. He ably answered the call to duty and throughout his term in \nthe Army, rising to the rank of sergeant, he represented our Nation \nwith valor and integrity.\n  During his distinguished career as a Capitol police officer, Lonnie \nworked 21 years on the Senate side of the Capitol. With his assignment \nto the ``barricade,'' as it is referred to, on the Delaware and C \nStreet entrance, Lonnie became friends with my colleagues and staff \nalike.\n  In the many years I entered that entrance, this fine man--whether it \nwas bitter cold or intensely hot, raining or sleeting--always \napproached my vehicle, as all others, with a big smile on his face. In \nthose days, when I guess my spirits were low, as I came, he lifted \nthose spirits. He always had a warm smile and an enthusiastic ``Good \nmorning, Senator.'' It has been my pleasure to receive those greetings, \nas I say, these many years. I shall dearly miss him.\n  Lonnie Tabron's philosophy in life consists of three main principles, \nand he sought to apply these important lessons to his career with the \nCapitol Police. Every day, Lonnie has remembered to treat others as he \nwould like to be treated, to speak to others as he would like them to \nspeak to him, and to respect others with the same measure of honor that \nhe would expect from them. I believe these three traits are \nexceptionally appropriate, and Lonnie certainly embodied his beliefs in \nhis service on Capitol Hill.\n\n[[Page S10820]]\n\n  In his 22 years on the Capitol Police Force, Lonnie has demonstrated \na willingness to help anyone who was in need. I appreciate very much \nhis dedication to his job and his remarkable professionalism. As he \nenters his well-deserved retirement, Lonnie will be dearly missed by \nthose who have had the opportunity to make his acquaintance. It is my \nhonor and privilege to commend his outstanding service today and to \nwish him well in the years ahead.\n  I thank my senior staff member, Awilda Euill, who is with me on the \nfloor today, a longtime admirer of Lonnie's. She assisted me in the \npreparation of this statement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/03/senate-section/article/S10820-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n CONGRATULATING JUDGE FRANCIS X.

Since 1976, when he began his service on \nthe juvenile court, to his service as an appellate trial referee today, \nhe has distinguished the State of Connecticut with his example of \nintegrity and honor.\n  As remarkable as Judge Hennessy's record is, with service on the \nConnecticut Superior Court, deputy chief court administrator of the \nJudicial Branch, and as judge of the Appellate Court, even more \nimpressive is his dedication to social equity. He has been a strong \nadvocate for insuring equal access to the courts for women and \nminorities, co-chairing the Connecticut Task Force on Gender Justice \nand the Courts, and Connecticut's Task Force on Minority Fairness.\n  Judge Hennessy's grandchildren Teddy, John and Grace and his children \nMaura, Margaret Mary, Matthew and Mark must be proud to have such an \nexemplar of achievement to look up to. His wife Mary Frances celebrates \nand shares in Judge Hennessy's accomplishments on this occasion of his \n75th birthday.\n  In addition to his legal career, Judge Hennessy served his country \nwith bravery in the U.S. Army during the Korean conflict. He received \nthe Purple Heart and Combat Infantryman's Badge. For this man, the call \nof duty extended beyond military service to enriching the community \naround him. He also served on Connecticut's State Library Board, on the \nSheriff's Advisory Board, and the State Gaming Commission.\n  Judge Hennessy was born on September 11, 1930, in New York City, and \nhas been a faithful servant of the State of Connecticut for the \nduration of his career. We in the U.S. Senate are proud and honored to \ncongratulate Judge Hennessy on his many years of public service and \noffer him best wishes on the occasion of his 75th birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/03/senate-section/article/S10820-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need \nfor hate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduce hate crimes legislation that would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the \nfloor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our \ncountry.\n  On January 30, 1999, a 23-year-old disabled man was lured into an \napartment in Keansburg, NJ. He was subjected to 3 hours of torture at \nthe hands of 9 men and women. According to police, the abusers knew the \nman from their neighborhood, and ridiculed him constantly because of \nhis disability.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/03/senate-section/article/S10820-3", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           LCPL JAMES R. SARGENT, UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I \nrise today too honor and commend the service of a true West Virginia \nhero. LCPL James R. Sargent of the United States Marine Corps was one \nof many West Virginians who courageously fought in the Vietnam War. \nLance Corporal Sargent's service was a testament to West Virginia's \nlong storied patriotic tradition. A tradition that can be traced back \nto the days of George Washington, and one that is very much alive \ntoday. In the spirit of West Virginia patriotism, I praise Lance \nCorporal Sargent for his honorable service and contribution to our \ncountry.\n  On October 7, 2005, after having been declared Missing in Action for \nover 37 years, LCPL James R. Sargent will finally be laid to rest at \nArlington National Cemetery. Lance Corporal Sargent was listed as \nmissing on May 10, 1968, as his platoon provided artillery support in \ndefense of the Civilian Irregular Defense Group camp known as Ngok \nTavak. The Marine detachment was attacked by a prepared and well-\nequipped Viet Cong and North Vietnamese battalion of troops. For their \nbravery in battle, Lance Corporal Sargent's platoon received the \nMeritorious Unit Commendation from then Secretary of the Navy L.F. \nChapman, Jr.\n  Lance Corporal Sargent was a native West Virginian from Anawalt in \nMcDowell County. Like so many West Virginians, past and present, Lance \nCorporal Sargent heeded the Nation's call for service, and they deserve \nour gratitude and deep respect. I am honored to be able to pay respects \nto this brave West Virginian and his family and friends. After many \nyears full of questions and grief, I hope that Lance Corporal Sargent's \nloved ones may finally have much deserved closure and peace of mind. \nHis surviving family, friends, and fellow veterans should all be proud \nof his service, patriotism, and commitment to his country and its \ndefense. For that matter, all Americans should be proud.\n  I ask that we all take a moment to remember all of the American \nsoldiers who gave their lives in service to their country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/03/senate-section/article/S10820-4", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10820-S10821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    JEWISH COMMUNITY RELIEF EFFORTS\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize and give thanks to the Jewish community's tremendous relief \nefforts in the aftermath of the Hurricane Katrina disaster. Countless \nJewish individuals and organizations have stepped up to combat this \nnational crisis, providing the victims of Hurricane Katrina with money, \nsupplies and volunteers, while opening the doors of their homes, \nschools and synagogues.\n  I would like to highlight a few of these efforts.\n  Millions of dollars haven been raised in the name of the Katrina \nvictims. The United Jewish Communities, local federations throughout \nthe United States and Canada, and their partners have raised at least \n$14 million, including a $500,000 donation given by the Baltimore-based \nHarry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation Inc. The Weinberg Foundation \ngave another $500,000 to Catholic Relief Charities. A smaller, but no \nless inspiring, fund was raised by students of the Sacramento, CA \nShalom School, which donated proceeds from sales of their Rosh Hashanah \nhoney pots.\n  Educational aid for displaced students has come from Jewish \norganizations such as the Avi Chai Foundation, a group sending \nemergency grant money to the dozens of Jewish day schools that are \nadmitting evacuees into their classrooms. And the Jewish Agency for \nIsrael, MASA--the Gateway to Long-Term Israel Programs and Hillel are \ncoordinating efforts to allow displaced students to take classes at \nIsraeli universities.\n  I would also like to recognize the synagogues that are contributing \ntheir resources to the effort by providing housing, schooling and free \nsynagogue memberships--even adopting other synagogues in impacted \nstates damaged by the storm.\n  But the Jewish assistance provided to the victims of Hurricane \nKatrina does not stop at our borders. The State of Israel has been \nincredibly generous as well, donating 80 tons of supplies including 15 \ntons of bottled water, 4 tons of rations, 4 tons of diapers, 1 ton of \nbaby food, Medical supplies including adult and children's wheelchairs \nand\n\n[[Page S10821]]\n\ncrutches, thousands of first-aid kits and thousands of blankets and \ncots. They have also sent teams of professionals trained in disaster \nrelief to assist victims of this terrible disaster, including doctors, \nparamedics, mental health professionals, search and rescue teams and \ndisaster relief planning and operations specialists.\n  In times such as these, it is critical that people of all faiths come \ntogether to help those in need and I am proud to see that the Jewish \ncommunity has stepped up and met the challenge head on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/03/senate-section/article/S10821-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  At 3:02 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 3863.

    By Mr. WARNER:\n  S. 1810. A bill to amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to \nallow certain coastal States to share in qualified Outer Continental \nShelf revenues; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Outer Continental \nShelf Revenue Sharing Act of 2005.\n  Earlier this year, the Congress passed a bill, and the President \nsigned it into law. It is the first comprehensive energy package in \nover a decade.\n  Great strides were made in addressing the Nation's energy needs. This \nnew law contains a number of valuable conservation measures and, as the \nchairman of the Energy Committee once stated, passage of this \nlegislation means we will need 170 fewer powerplants by 2020. On the \nenergy supply side, however, we still have much work to do. The recent \ndisruptions in the Nation's energy supply caused by Hurricanes Katrina \nand Rita--tragedies, natural disasters of proportions never really seen \nbefore in this county--underscore the fragility of our energy supply \nsystem. The estimates are that 20 to 25 percent of our energy needs \ncome in through that narrow nexus of Louisiana and Mississippi, right \nin that area.\n  During debate on the bill, I offered an amendment to provide for an \nincreased domestic supply of oil and natural gas from Outer Continental \nShelf lands. Regrettably, my amendment and other similar measures were \nnot successful.\n  I thank the distinguished manager of that bill, Mr. Domenici, and \nothers. They gave me a great deal of encouragement, as did the Senators \nfrom Louisiana, who likewise participated in that debate. But, \nnevertheless, I was not successful. I did say--and I suppose in a \nprophetic way--and I remember beckoning to fellow Senators on the \nfloor, ``The day will come when I will once again stand on this floor \nand offer this same legislation, not knowing, of course, of the \ntragedies of Katrina. But that did give this Nation a serious wake-up \ncall as to the fragility of our energy system.\n  Again, the tragic events of the past month along the gulf coast have \nthrust the issue of energy supplies back into the spotlight. We need \nonly look at the rising gas prices all over our pumps in this Nation's \nland, where people--men and women--on small budgets are struggling to \nfind the resources to meet their daily requirements of the use of the \nautomobile and to inject these increased gasoline prices into their \nbudgets. Prices at the pump have climbed quickly, and with the winter \nheating season approaching, we can expect natural gas and home heating \noil prices to increase, perhaps going as high as 50 percent more than \nlast year's level.\n  We need to address our inadequate refining capacity and expand \nconservation incentives. With more than 30 percent of our domestic \nsupply of oil coming in from the Gulf of Mexico and a significant \nportion of our refining capacity located in the Gulf States, we must \nalso look at ways to increase and diversify the location and sources of \nour domestic supplies of energy, as well as the refining capabilities; \nand natural gas, likewise.\n  Before passage of the energy bill, production revenues totaling more \nthan $7.5 billion annually from offshore oil and gas belonged to the \nFederal Government. This is an inconsistent policy, however, because 55 \npercent of the revenues from land-based oil and gas production has \nalways been returned to the States. The one exception to this rule is \nAlaska, which receives back 90 percent of such revenues. Thanks to the \ndiligence of my colleagues from Louisiana, this inequity was partially \naddressed in the energy bill by providing that current offshore energy-\nproducing States will now share in the Federal Government's royalties.\n  Indeed, it is a matter of fairness that these revenues be shared with \nthe energy producing States. After all, it is the states closest to oil \nand gas production facilities that are assuming the risks that those \nproduction facilities will not have harmful environmental or economical \nimpacts. Tourism is often the lifeblood of these regions which could be \nadversely affected by any environmental accidents. So it is very \nappropriate that they should receive a share of the revenues derived \nfrom offshore oil and gas production.\n  While the issue of revenue sharing was addressed in the energy bill \nfor States currently producing oil and gas off their coasts, it does \nnot include a comprehensive policy for offshore production \nopportunities.\n  Specifically, the bill does not allow other States to share revenues \nwhen and if they ever become producing regions. As we all know, the \nproduction of oil and natural gas has been subject to a moratorium \nalong most of the Nation's coastline. While this moratorium has been in \neffect for some time, many Americans believe that it is now time to \nreevaluate its need. This past year in Virginia, both houses of the \nstate legislature passed legislation asking for production to occur off \nthe Virginia coast if the State is allowed to receive a share of the \nrevenue. I think the rising costs of oil and gas are now leading other \nStates to consider the same possibility.\n  The bill I am introducing today would provide a portion of revenues \nto States under the current moratorium that may decide to undertake \nfuture offshore exploration and production activities. My legislation \nis based, in large part, on the hard work of my colleagues who achieved \na revenue-sharing proposal for their States and local governments in \nthe recently enacted energy bill. The new law provides State and local \ngovernments with a share of the royalties from offshore energy \nproduction, but it is limited only to the five States that are \ncurrently exempt from the moratorium on offshore oil and gas leases.\n  As provided by current law, my bill requires the Federal Government \nto transfer 50 percent of the revenues received from any offshore \nleases to the States based upon the production levels. This would put \noil and gas production in coastal areas on par with the production on \nother Federal lands throughout the United States. It is a matter of \nequity for all producing regions and represents a fair revenue-sharing \nmodel for the Federal and State governments.\n  My proposal does not affect the current moratorium on offshore energy \nproduction. As the moratorium expires, however, my legislation enables \nStates that wish to pursue oil and gas production to be eligible for a \nportion of the royalty payments that otherwise would go exclusively to \nthe Federal Government.\n  The amendment does not supersede a State's ability to veto any \nproduction proposals under their authority of the Coastal Zone \nManagement Act, CZMA. It does not change the manner in which the \nFederal Government grants these production leases, and it does not lift \nthe moratorium for any OCS land that is currently in place.\n  While I believe very strongly that the States should have a role in \ndetermining whether or not to utilize these resources, I also believe \nthat they should receive a fair share of the revenues from any \nproduction that may follow.\n  I understand the concerns of some of my colleagues and their desire \nto avoid drawing specific boundary lines. While this amendment does not \naddress all of the concerns, it offers a fair starting point to discuss \nthis issue. It is my hope that we can all work together in addressing \nthese concerns that will result in a commonsense approach to expand our \ndomestic supply of oil and gas, to diversify the geographic \nconcentration of our current industry, and to allow the States to have \na role in the process.\n\n[[Page S10825]]\n\n  Mr. President, the time has come for the Senate to speak boldly. We \ncan all agree that more supply is needed and that there is a vast \nresource yet to be tapped. My proposal offers a fair way to encourage \nproduction in States that wish to do so. In the long term our Nation \nwill benefit by reducing its dependence on foreign sources of energy \nand by diversifying the geographic source of our domestic supply.\n  I believe this proposal will solve a necessary part of the energy \npuzzle. I believe it is essential for our energy security, our economic \nsecurity, and our national security to evaluate this, and other \nproposals, that address our energy supply needs.\n  Mr. President, as I say, today I introduce, again, this bill, which I \nput in a few months ago. It provides for the offshore drilling of oil. \nI recognize the sensitivity of that, but I say to my colleagues, we can \nnot continually ignore these warnings, whether they are brought about \nby Mother Nature or political problems or wars or conflicts across our \nshores. Now is the time to lay down that framework of legislation for \nthose States which, by actions taken by the Governor and the State \nlegislature, say: We will permit offshore drilling off of this State's \nboundaries. Hopefully, we can receive for those States, should that \ntake place, an additional source of revenue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord, and I will seek to have it considered by the Senate as a whole \nat the earliest possible opportunity.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1810\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to study \nthe feasibility of enlarging the Arthur V. Watkins Dam Weber Basin \nProject, Utah, to provide additional water for the Weber Basin Project \nto fulfill the purposes for which that project was authorized; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Bennett):\n  S. 1812. A bill to amend the Reclamation Projects Authorization and \nAdjustment Act of 1992 to provide for the conjunctive use of surface \nand ground water in Juab County, Utah; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, in recent years, Utahns have suffered \nthrough a devastating drought. While it appears that we are beginning \nto return to normal precipitation levels, the drought has instilled in \nall Utahns the need to plan for the future and ensure sound management \nof our water resources. For that reason, I rise to introduce two \nimportant bills that will help make better use of Utah's scarce water \nsupply.\n  The first bill is the Arthur V. Watkins Dam Enlargement Act of 2005. \nThe bill would authorize the Bureau of Reclamation to conduct a \nfeasibility study on raising the height of the Arthur V. Watkins Dam in \nWeber County. The dam is roughly 14 miles long and encloses a reservoir \ncontaining more than 200,000 acre-feet of water.\n  Thousands of Utahns currently rely on the water provided by the \nreservoir. And the Weber Basin is one of Utah's fastest growing areas, \nmaking the need to find additional water resources even more pressing. \nEnlarging the dam would help ensure that the area can meet its ever-\nincreasing demand for water. In my view, expanding the dam is an easy \nway to increase water storage capacity in an area that desperately \nneeds it.\n  The next bill I am introducing today, is the Juab County Ground Water \nStudy and Development Act of 2005. This legislation would amend the \nReclamation Projects Authorization and Adjustment Act of 2005 to \ninclude Juab County. It would allow Juab County to use Central Utah \nProject funds to complete water resource development projects, enabling \nthe County to better utilize their existing water resources. It will \nensure that farmers, ranchers, and other citizens of Juab County have a \nreliable water supply.\n  Under the original plan for the Bonneville Unit of the Central Utah \nProject, several counties in central Utah, including Juab, were to be \ndelivered supplemental water through an irrigation and drainage \ndelivery system. Over the years, however, many central Utah Counties \nhave elected not to participate in the plan and no longer pay the \nrequisite taxes to the Central Utah Water Conservancy District, the \npolitical division of the State of Utah established to manage CUP \nactivities in Utah.\n  Unlike other central Utah Counties, Juab County remained active in \nthe Central Utah Water Conservancy District's efforts and has paid \nproperty taxes to the District hoping to benefit from its membership. \nUnfortunately, that has not been the case. Presently, most of the water \nallocated to the Bonneville Unit of the Central Utah Project is planned \nfor use in Wasatch, Salt Lake, and Utah Counties. This legislation \nwould simply ensure that the citizens of Juab County can benefit from \nthe system they help support.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these bills.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Brownback):\n  S. 1813. A bill to amend titles 10 and 38 of the United States Code, \nto modify the circumstances under which a person who has committed a \ncapital offense is denied certain burial-related benefits and funeral \nhonors; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nlegislation I am introducing that will fix a problem that many of us \nthought was corrected 8 years ago. My legislation will close a loophole \nin the law that now allows capital offenders to be buried in America's \nnational cemeteries. My legislation will ensure that no one who may be \ngiven a life sentence or who may be sentenced to death for murder will \nbe honored at their funerals by the presence of a military funeral \ndetail. And, finally, my legislation will direct the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs, the Secretary of the Army, and other military service \nSecretaries to each prescribe a proactive process by which officials \ncan ascertain whether there exists a burial or funeral honors \nprohibition on individuals who may have been capital offenders.\n  In 1997, the Congress learned that the perpetrator of the Oklahoma \nCity bombings--Timothy McVeigh--was, in fact, eligible for burial and \nmemorialization in a VA national cemetery and, under certain \ncircumstances, Arlington National Cemetery. Largely, but not \nexclusively, in response to McVeigh's eligibility, Public Law 105-116 \nwas enacted to deny interment in Arlington National Cemetery, VA \nNational Cemeteries, and State veterans' cemeteries funded with VA \ngrants, to any person convicted of a Federal capital crime or a State \ncapital crime for which a sentence of death or life imprisonment \nwithout parole is given. Later, in 2002, Public Law 107-330 was enacted \nto deny to capital offenders VA-provided flags, headstones and markers, \nand Presidential Memorial Certificates. The intent of the 1997 and 2002 \nlaws was clear: We should not bury brutal murderers alongside America's \nhonored dead and we should not provide memorialization benefits to \nthose who have so dishonored themselves through their own post-service \nconduct.\n  The circumstances surrounding the placement of the cremated remains \nof a convicted double-murderer--Russell Wayne Wagner--at Arlington \nNational Cemetery in late July caused me, and many of my colleagues, to \nwonder what impact the 1997 law actually had. The media coverage of \nformer Chief Justice William Rehnquist's Arlington Cemetery funeral \nonly served to confirm my bewilderment: How could an individual like \nWagner who committed such heinous acts be placed in the same hallowed \nground as Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice Thurgood Marshall, President \nKennedy, and hundreds upon hundreds of servicemembers to whom this \ncountry owes its eternal respect?\n  Russell Wayne Wagner's two life sentences carried with them the \npossibility of parole. The 1997 law only bars national cemetery \ninterment to State capital offenders sentenced to death or life in \nprison without parole. Thus, we have our first example of the ``parole \nloophole.''\n  To further explore how wide the ``parole loophole'' is for State \ncapital offenders, I asked the Congressional Research Service to \nanalyze the sentencing of Dennis Rader, the infamous ``BTK serial \nkiller,''--``BTK'' being short for Rader's method to dispose of his 10 \nvictims: Bind, Torture, Kill. Rader was given ten consecutive life \nterms for which he must serve a minimum of 175 years in prison. \nHowever, because the Kansas law under which Rader was tried did not \nallow for a sentence of death, nor did it allow for a sentence of life \nwithout parole, CRS concluded that, as an honorably discharged veteran \nof the Air Force, ``it would appear that he is not statutorily \nprecluded from interment in a national cemetery.'' If the 1997 law \ncannot prevent the interment of a notorious serial killer, then what \ngood is it? I called a hearing in September to find an answer to that \nquestion.\n  The Committee heard from Mr. Vernon Davis, son of Wagner's victims, \nwho described in vivid detail how Wagner repeatedly stabbed his elderly \nparents to death. I was so astounded that an individual who committed \nsuch a cowardly action could be buried at Arlington that I immediately \nintroduced legislation--S. 1759--to have his remains removed.\n  The Committee also heard from VA and Arlington cemetery officials who \ndescribed the process that is in place to deny burial in national \ncemeteries to capital offenders. Unfortunately, the process appears to \nbe a passive one. The Deputy Superintendent at Arlington told me that \nArlington officials do\n\n[[Page S10827]]\n\nnot even ask whether a person on whose behalf burial is sought is a \nconvicted capital offender. While I understand that finding out such \ninformation needs to be handled delicately and with tact, to have no \nscreening process at all is unacceptable.\n  Finally, we heard the unified testimony of 5 veterans' organizations, \nwho reminded us that decisions to take away benefits earned by virtue \nof honorable military service should never be made without careful, \nreasoned deliberation.\n  Based on the testimony from the Committee's hearing, I have joined \nwith my colleagues from Kansas--Senators Roberts and Brownback--in \nintroducing this legislation today. Section 1 of the legislation would \nremove the language in law that provides capital offenders--like Wagner \nand the BTK Killer--with their continued burial eligibility. \nFurthermore, to address situations where a capital offender may have \nplea-bargained his or her way out of a death or life sentence, section \n1 would remove the language in statute that ties the prohibition of \ncemetery burial to a capital crime sentence that was received and would \nreplace it with language tying the prohibition to a capital crime \nsentence that may be received. This statutory language change would \nrecognize that while the actual sentence for those who commit heinous \nacts may vary, the underlying action meriting those criminal sentences \nshould be treated equally for purposes of burial prohibition.\n  Section 2 of the legislation would deny the provision of military \nhonors and burial at a military cemetery of a person convicted of a \nFederal capital crime or a State capital crime for which a life \nsentence or the death penalty may be imposed. Section 3 would deny \nfuneral honors--where at least two members of the Armed Forces are made \navailable at veterans' funerals to fold and present the American flag, \nand play Taps--to those same persons, irrespective of whether burial is \nsought at national, state, or private cemeteries.\n  Finally, section 4 of the legislation would require the appropriate \nmilitary service and VA to each prescribe regulations to ensure that a \nperson is neither buried, nor provided funeral honors, before a good-\nfaith effort is made to determine whether such person is ineligible as \na capital offender.\n  This legislation is a necessary reform to the 1997 law. Let me be \nclear that while the effect of the legislation would be to take away \nbenefits that were otherwise earned by honorable military service, the \nintent of it is not punitive. Rather, my intention is to preserve the \ndignity of America's national cemeteries.\n  President Lincoln delivered his Gettysburg Address at one of our \nNation's first, and most revered, national cemeteries. Then he spoke of \nthe ``honored dead'' who gave their ``last full measure of devotion.'' \nMy legislation will ensure that we bring no dishonor to those who \nbelong in our national cemeteries by inappropriately honoring those \nwho, by their own actions, do not.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1813\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

DENIAL OF CERTAIN BURIAL-RELATED BENEFITS.\n\n       Section 985 of title 10, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``who has been convicted \n     of a capital offense under Federal or State law for which the \n     person was sentenced to death or life imprisonment without \n     parole.'' and inserting ``described in section 2411(b) of \n     title 38.'';\n       (2) in subsection (b), by striking ``convicted of a capital \n     offense under Federal law'' and inserting ``described in \n     section 2411(b) of title 38''; and\n       (3) by amending subsection (c) to read as follows:\n       ``(c) Definition.--In this section, the term `burial' \n     includes inurnment.''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON ESTABLISHMENT OF BAKERS CREEK \n                   MEMORIAL.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In 1943 and 1944, the United States Armed Forces \n     operated a rest and relaxation facility in Mackay, \n     Queensland, Australia, for troops serving in the Pacific \n     Theater during World War II.\n       (2) On June 14, 1943, a Boeing B-17C was transporting 6 \n     crew members and 35 servicemen from Mackay to Port Moresby, \n     New Guinea, to return the servicemen to duty after 10 days of \n     rest and relaxation leave at an Army/Red Cross facility.\n       (3) The aircraft crashed shortly after take-off at Bakers \n     Creek, Australia, killing all 6 crew members and 34 of the 35 \n     servicemen being transported in what was at that point the \n     worst crash in American air transport history, and what \n     remains the worst air disaster in Australian history.\n       (4) Due to wartime censorship rules related to the movement \n     of troops, the tragic crash and loss of life were not \n     reported to the Australian or United States public.\n       (5) Many family members of those killed did not learn the \n     circumstances of the troops deaths until they were contacted \n     by the Bakers Creek Memorial Foundation beginning in 1992.\n       (6) As of May 2005, the Bakers Creek Memorial Foundation \n     had contacted 36 of the 40 families that lost loved ones in \n     the tragic crash, and was continuing efforts to locate the \n     remaining four families to inform them of the true events of \n     the crash at Bakers Creek.\n       (7) The Australian people marked the tragic crash at Bakers \n     Creek with a memorial established in 1992, but no similar \n     memorial has been established in the United States.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the Secretary of the Army may establish an appropriate \n     marker, at a site to be chosen at the discretion of the \n     Secretary, to commemorate the 40 members of the United States \n     Armed Forces who lost their lives in the air crash at Bakers \n     Creek, Australia, on June 14, 1943.\n\n DIVISION C--DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY NATIONAL SECURITY AUTHORIZATIONS AND \n                          OTHER AUTHORIZATIONS\n\n      TITLE XXXI--DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY NATIONAL SECURITY PROGRAMS\n\n         Subtitle A--National Security Programs Authorizations\n\n     SEC. 3101.

This route is ideal for drug trafficking \n     because of its geographic expanse, numerous law enforcement \n     jurisdictions and fragmented investigative efforts.\n       (3) The tethered aerostat system in Lajas, Puerto Rico \n     contributes to deterring and detecting smugglers moving \n     illicit drugs into Puerto Rico. The aerostat's range and \n     operational capabilities allow it to provide surveillance \n     coverage of the eastern Caribbean corridor and the strategic \n     waterway between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, \n     known a the Mona Passage.\n       (4) Including maritime radar on the Lajas aerostat will \n     expand its ability to detect suspicious vessels in the \n     eastern Caribbean corridor.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--Given the above findings, it is \n     the sense of the Senate that--\n\n[[Page S10891]]\n\n       (1) Congress and the Department of Defense fully fund the \n     Counter-Drug Tethered Aerostat program.\n       (2) Department of Defense install maritime radar on the \n     Lajas, Puerto Rico aerostat.\n       At the end of subtitle A of title V, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 509.

Earlier today, or earlier this afternoon, I remarked that \nthis is a momentous day in our Nation's history. For the first time in \ntwo decades, a new Chief Justice ascends to the bench of the highest \nCourt of the land. Judge Roberts is leading the Supreme Court as the \n17th Chief Justice of the United States today.\n  Today marks the nomination of Harriet Miers as an Associate Justice \nfor the Supreme Court, and we had yet another opportunity to shape the \ncourse of our history. She will be a great addition to the Supreme \nCourt. She does have extensive legal experience, both in the private \nsector as well as counsel for the President. She understands judicial \nrestraint. She understands that limited role of the judge to interpret \nthe law and not to legislate from the bench.\n  We are ready to begin this nomination process. Officially, it has now \nbegun with her nomination. We will have a civil process, a dignified \nprocess that ultimately will lead to a confirmation of Ms. Miers before \nThanksgiving.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/03/senate-section/article/S10912-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:45 A.M.
