Thank you very much, Mr. President. Speaking on the \nminority side, I would like to say that we face a historic vote today \non stem cell\n\n[[Page S7654]]\n\nresearch. This is a vote that millions of Americans are watching. \nPeople who are suffering from diabetes, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, \nspinal cord injuries, they can't understand why America, for the last 5 \nyears, has shut down medical research that promises hope--hope for \ncures. They can't understand that the President of the United States \nmade the decision--almost unprecedented in our history--to close down \nmedical research. He didn't do it absolutely, and that is the curious \nthing.\n  If this is a question of being driven by moral values, I don't \nunderstand how the President could conclude that using existing stem \ncell lines, 78 of them, is permissible, but using 1 more is immoral. I \ndon't follow his logic. Frankly, I don't believe it is logical.\n  What we have before us is an opportunity to move forward on stem cell \nresearch with very strict ethical guidelines. We have a choice: Will we \ntake these thousands of stem cells--which, frankly, will be discarded \nas waste and surplus--will we allow that to happen or use them in a \nlaboratory to give a 12-year-old girl suffering from juvenile diabetes \na chance for a normal, happy life?\n  Will we use these stem cells to try to explore possibilities for the \nepidemics of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's and Lou Gehrig's disease and \nfinally have some avenue toward a cure? Are we going to tie our hands \nas a nation?\n  The Senate has a chance today to vote for the real bill: H.R. 810. \nThat is the only bill dealing with stem cell research. There are two \nother bills we will be voting on, and honestly, they don't mean \nanything. They mean so little. One prohibits practices that are not \noccurring, and the other is just words--words that don't really lead to \nresearch.\n  What is really troubling is the President has sent us a message, and \nwe received it yesterday. The President said, with his Statement of \nAdministration Policy, if H.R. 810, the real stem cell research bill, \nwere presented to the President, he would veto the bill. This \nPresident, who calls himself a compassionate conservative, has a chance \nwith the stem cell research bill to show his compassion for the \nmillions of people suffering from disease, people who are clinging to \nthe possibility of hope in medical research. I hope the President will \nreconsider. I hope he will not just dig in and say: That's it, I won't \neven think about it.\n  I hope the President will pray on this because he is a prayerful man, \nand if he does, I hope he will understand that throwing away these stem \ncells, discarding them, declaring they are medical waste, is a waste of \nopportunity and a waste of hope.\n  We have a chance with this stem cell bill to give hope to people. I \nhave gathered those in Chicago who are interested in the issue, and \nthere are so many of them: Representatives of groups, a mother who \nwakes in the middle of the night two or three times to take a blood \ntest on her little girl to see if she needs insulin; a couple sitting \nbefore me--I will never forget them--he is suffering from Lou Gehrig's \ndisease. He is in his thirties. He has reached the point now where he \ncannot speak or move. She brings him to our meeting, and as she \ndescribes what they have been through, tears are rolling down his \ncheeks, realizing he can't do anything to help himself at this point.\n  Well, there is a chance--a chance, perhaps, for him but certainly for \nothers--a chance for them, for those suffering from Parkinson's.\n  My colleague from Illinois in the House, Lane Evans, is my buddy. We \ncame to the House together in 1982. What a great guy. He is a Vietnam \nera Marine Corps veteran. He wins an upset victory in Illinois, comes \nin, he is a great Congressman, and then Parkinson's strikes. He had to \nannounce this year he is ending his public career to continue this \nvaliant battle against Parkinson's.\n  He said, when he came to the floor and spoke on behalf of this bill: \nThis is not just about the right to life, it is the right to live, the \nright for him to live, the right for others to live.\n  I implore my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass this bill \ntoday with a strong vote. Say to the President: Please, in prayerful \nreflection, think about these people who are counting on us. Think \nabout our chance to show that we are not just compassionate \nconservatives and compassionate progressives and compassionate \nliberals, we are compassionate Americans.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this bill, and I urge the President to \nreconsider his veto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from Alaska \non the Senate floor.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of stem cell \nresearch.\n\n[[Page S7655]]\n\n  I plan to vote in favor of each of the three bills that we will be \nconsidering today. I call upon my colleagues to pass all three of these \nbills. I call upon the President to sign all of them into law.\n  Make no mistake about it. This is an important debate. We will cast \nimportant votes today.\n  Even with all the events taking place the world today, including the \ndevelopments in Lebanon, Syria, and Iran, it is my hope--and the hope \nof many others--that when the history of our time is written, the \nultimate outcome of today's debate over stem cell research will have \nbeen a major breakthrough in our understanding of, and ability to \npromote, human health and prevent and treat disease.\n  I admire and respect President Bush tremendously for being the first \nPresident to dedicate Federal funds for stem cell research. As many may \nrecall, in August 2001, the President announced that Federal funds \nwould be used for research on 60 stem cell lines that were created from \nembryos that have already been destroyed. Unfortunately, many of these \nstem lines became contaminated so the cells could never be used for \nscientific research. I believe that H.R. 810 must be signed into law in \norder to make the President's policy work because in my view, the \nPresident already made the decision to use the cells. H.R. 810 just \nchanges the guidelines for stem cell research by allowing embryos that \nwould otherwise be discarded to be made available for research. I \nbelieve that by using these embryos for medical research, we are, in \nfact, promoting life.\n  One of the reasons why so many are so interested in this debate is \nthat literally everyone either has, or knows, a loved one who has, one \nof the diseases or conditions that may one day benefit from stem cell \nresearch.\n  One reason why I support stem cell research so strongly is because I \nhave heard from so many of my fellow citizens of Utah and fellow \nAmericans about how important this issue is to them and their families.\n  That is the reason why Nancy Reagan wrote me the following letter \nabout stem cell research:\n\n                                                       May 1, 2006\n       Dear Orrin: Thank you for your continued commitment to \n     helping the millions of Americans who suffer from devastating \n     and disabling diseases. Your support has given so much hope \n     to so many.\n       It has been nearly a year since the United States House of \n     Representatives first approved the stem cell legislation that \n     would open the research so we could fully unleash its \n     promise. For those who are waiting every day for scientific \n     progress to help their loved ones, the wait for United States \n     Senate action has been very difficult and hard to comprehend.\n       I understand that the United States Senate is now \n     considering voting on H.R. 810, the Stem Cell Research \n     Enhancement Act, sometime this month. Orrin, I know I can \n     count on friends like you to help make sure this happens. \n     There is just no more time to wait.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                            Nancy.\n\n  I want to make it clear that there is broad consensus among leading \nscientists that among the three bills we will vote upon today--the Stem \nCell Research and Enhancement Act, H.R. 810; the Alternative \nPluripotent Stem Cell Therapies Enhancement Act, S. 2754; and the Fetus \nFarming Prohibition Act of 2006--it is H.R. 810 that can most \nimmediately advance science.\n  The vote on H.R. 810 is the one that really counts.\n  Some in this debate suggest that passage of the Specter-Santorum \nalternatives bill would obviate the need for H.R. 810. Neither Senator \nSpecter nor I believe that. Nor do the leading scientists in America \nbelieve that. Nor should you believe that.\n  To put a point on it, the other two bills, S. 2754 and S. 3504, are \nmost emphatically not a substitute for H.R. 810. These bills complement \nH.R. 810. In no way can, or do, they replace H.R. 810.\n  I support the alternatives bill, S. 2754, for a lot of the same \nreasons why I coauthored the cord blood stem cell research bill that \nPresident Bush signed into law last year. I believe that all \nscientifically credible and ethically sound avenues of stem cell \nresearch ought to be pursued. I might add that when we passed the cord \nblood legislation, that form of research had already yielded tangible \nresults for several types of diseases, such as some forms of bone \nmarrow cancer.\n  In sharp contrast, whatever benefits the alternatives bill may yield, \nexperts tell us that they are largely unrealized today and, as often \nthe case with cutting edge science, uncertain in the future. But that \nis the way science works. Advance in science often progresses in fits \nand starts. Sometimes, actually most of the time, particular avenues of \nresearch are found to be blind alleys and advances do not come. Many \nseeds of discovery have to be planted for the flower of progress to \nbloom.\n  Today's votes give us an opportunity to move forward on several \nfronts.\n  Let us be clear that the centerpiece of today's debate is H.R. 810. \nThis is the bill that will help provide the long overdue expansion of \nthe number of stem cell lines eligible for federally funded biomedical \nresearch. This is what our leading scientists have told us they want \nand need to move the field of stem cell research forward.\n  I have worked with leading scientists throughout my 30-year career in \nthe Senate. Few, if any, issues have created the genuine sense of \nexcitement among the scientific community as have the current \nopportunities in stem cell research.\n  Listen to what Dr. Harold Varmus has said about the promise of stem \ncell research. Dr. Varmus is a Nobel Laureate. He is the former \nDirector of the National Institutes of Health. He currently runs the \nprestigious Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. By all accounts, he is one \nof the leading scientists in the world. I met with Dr. Varmus on \nseveral occasions to learn what scientists think about stem cell \nresearch.\n  Here is Dr. Varmus' assessment:\n\n       (t)he development of a cell that may produce almost every \n     tissue of the human body is an unprecedented scientific \n     breakthrough. It is not too unrealistic to say that this \n     practice has the potential to revolutionize the practice of \n     medicine.\n\n  More than 40 other Nobel prize-winners and as well most of our \nNation's leading scientists, disease advocacy organizations, and many \nother interested citizens and organizations share this view.\n  For example, here is what Dr. Edward Clark of the University of Utah \nDepartment of Pediatrics has told me about stem cell research:\n\n        . . . I can assure you that the scientific progress of \n     stem cell research is extraordinary.\n        . . . In pediatrics, stem cell research offers therapy, \n     and indeed possibly a cure, for a wide variety of childhood \n     diseases, including neurologic disease, spinal cord injuries, \n     and heart disease . . .\n       I can think of nothing that will provide as much meaningful \n     therapy for children and children's problems than the promise \n     offered by stem cell research.\n\n  It is not hard to understand why the additional stem cell lines that \ncan and will be used by federally funded scientists if H.R. 810 becomes \nlaw is so exciting for scientists and important for the American \npublic.\n  The stakes of today's debate are high. As a report of the influential \nNational Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine has stated:\n\n       (S)tem cell research has the potential to affect the lives \n     of millions of people in the United States and around the \n     world.\n\n  This Institute of Medicine Report goes on to cite the following high \nprevalence diseases as likely candidates for stem cell research: \nCardiovascular Disease--58 million U.S. patients; Autoimmune Diseases--\n30 million U.S. patients; Diabetes--16 million U.S. patients; \nOsteoporosis--10 million U.S. patients; Cancer--10 million U.S. \npatients; Alzheimer's Disease--5.5 million U.S. patients; Parkinson's \nDisease--1.5 million U.S. patients.\n  What family in America does not include someone afflicted with a \ndisease on this list? And a complete list includes many other diseases \nand conditions such as spinal cord injuries, burns, and many birth \ndefects. Experts believe that upward of 100 million Americans--and \nhundreds of millions of others around the world--may one day benefit \nfrom stem cell research.\n  For example, let us consider spinal cord injuries. Who does not know, \nor know of, someone whose life has been devastated by a spinal cord \ninjury?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter I received just last month from Michael Armstrong, Chairman of \nthe Board of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S7656]]\n\n\n\n\n                                       Johns Hopkins Medicine,\n\n                                        Naples, FL, June 26, 2006.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I'm writing to let you know about an \n     exciting recent breakthrough in biomedical research at the \n     Johns Hopkins University. Using mouse embryonic stem cells, \n     scientists led by Dr. Douglas Kerr have regenerated damaged \n     nerve tissue in paralyzed rats, thereby restoring motor \n     function. The details of Dr. Kerr's research are described in \n     a press release attached to this letter.\n       This breakthrough represents the first time that scientists \n     have actually re-grown damaged components of a nervous \n     system, and it could lead to human therapies that seemed \n     previously to be beyond our reach. Treatments not only for \n     paralysis, but for ALS, multiple sclerosis, and similar \n     diseases of the brain now seem possible. The exact timeframe \n     is impossible to predict, but it will almost certainly depend \n     on the availability of federal funding.\n       Due to restrictions on federal funding of embryonic stem \n     cell research, Dr. Kerr will likely seek state support for \n     his continuing work. We at Johns Hopkins applaud the \n     courageous efforts of the Maryland General Assembly to make \n     that support possible by passing the Maryland Stem Cell \n     Enhancement Act earlier this year.\n       The level of funding that will ultimately be required to \n     advance this field of science to human trials, however, \n     suggests that federal funding will be necessary. Yet under \n     current federal policy, the only stem cell lines eligible for \n     federal funding were created using mouse feeder cells and \n     could never be used in clinical trials with humans. It is \n     therefore crucial that current federal stem cell policy be \n     revised.\n       We are grateful for your ongoing commitment to biomedical \n     research. I'm sure your leadership on this issue will \n     continue to uphold the best interests of American researcher, \n     physicians, and above all, patients.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             C. Michael Armstrong,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this letter describes groundbreaking \nresearch conducted by a Johns Hopkins scientist, Dr. Douglas Kerr, on \nhow mouse embryonic stem cells have been able to regenerate damaged \nnerve tissue in paralyzed rats. According to the letter from Johns \nHopkins University, one of the world's most respected biomedical \nresearch institutions in the world, Dr. Kerr's ``breakthrough \nrepresents the first time that scientists have actually re-grown \ndamaged components of a nervous system, and it could lead to human \ntherapies that seemed previously to be beyond our reach. Treatments not \nonly for paralysis, but for ALS, multiple sclerosis, and similar \ndiseases of the brain now seem possible.''\n  The current Director of the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Elias \nZerhouni, has said that this research is ``a remarkable advance that \ncan help us understand how stem cells can begin to fulfill their great \npromise.''\n  However, unless H.R. 810 becomes law and the number of stem cells \nlines eligible for Federal funding is expanded, this promising research \ncould die on the vine.\n  As Mr. Armstrong explains in his letter:\n\n       The level of funding that will that will ultimately be \n     required to advance this field of science to human clinical \n     trials, however, suggests that federal funding will be \n     necessary. Yet, under current federal policy, the only stem \n     cell lines eligible for federal funding were created using \n     mouse feeder cells and could never be used in clinical trials \n     with humans. It is therefore crucial that current stem cell \n     policy be revised.\n\n  The precise type of revision that the scientists at Johns Hopkins \ntell us is needed is precisely the change in Federal policy that H.R. \n810, the Castle-DeGette bill, will bring about.\n  And the scientists at Johns Hopkins are hardly alone.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from Dr. Darrel Kirch, President of the Association of \nAmerican Medical Colleges.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    Association of\n\n\n                                    American Medical Colleges,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 11, 2006.\n       Dear Senator: The Association of American Medical Colleges \n     (AAMC) urges you to vote in favor of the ``Stem Cell Research \n     Enhancement Act of 2005'' (H.R. 810) when it is considered by \n     the Senate. The AAMC, which represents the nation's 125 \n     accredited medical schools, some 400 major teaching \n     hospitals, and more than 105,000 faculty in 94 academic and \n     scientific societies, endorses this legislation to expand \n     Federal support for stem cell research while adhering to \n     strict federal oversight and standards. In accordance with \n     current law, the legislation ensures that no Federal funding \n     shall be used to derive stem cells or destroy embryos.\n       The discovery of human pluripotent stem cells is a \n     significant research advance and Federal support to American \n     researchers is essential both to translate this discovery \n     into novel therapies for a range of serious and intractable \n     diseases, and to ensure that this research is conducted under \n     a rigorous and credible ethical regime. The therapeutic \n     potential of pluripotent stem cells is remarkable and could \n     well prove to be one of the important paradigm-shifting \n     advances in the history of medical science. These cells have \n     the unique potential to differentiate into any human cell \n     type and offer real hope of life-affirming treatments for \n     diabetes, damaged heart tissue, arthritis, Parkinson's, ALS \n     and spinal cord injuries, to name but a few examples. There \n     is also the possibility that these cells could be used to \n     create more complex organ structures that could replace \n     diseased vital organs, such as kidneys, livers, or even \n     hearts.\n       We recognize the significant ethical issues that are raised \n     about embryonic stem cell research and we respect the view of \n     those who oppose such research, including some in our own \n     medical school community. However. we are persuaded otherwise \n     by what we believe is an equally compelling ethical \n     consideration, namely, that it would be tragic to waste the \n     unique potential afforded by embryonic stem cells, derived \n     from embryos destined to be discarded in any case, to \n     alleviate human suffering and enhance the quality of human \n     life.\n       This legislation recognizes the need to expand Federal \n     support of research on pluripotent stem cells so that the \n     tremendous scientific and medical benefits of their use may \n     one day become available to the millions of patients who so \n     desperately need them. Again, we urge you to vote for this \n     bill, which will help ensure the potential of this research \n     is translated into treatments and cures.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Darrell G. Kirch, M.D.,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this organization represents our Nation's \n125 accredited medical schools, 400 teaching hospitals, and more than \n105,000 medical school faculty in 94 academic and scientific societies. \nThis letter, sent to all Senators last Tuesday, call for us to support \nH.R. 810. The AAMC letter states:\n\n       The therapeutic potential of pluripotent stem cells is \n     remarkable and could well prove to be one of the important \n     paradigm-shifting advances in the history of medical science.\n\n  Support for H.R. 810 is not confined solely to academicians. Last \nyear, when the House took up and passed H.R. 810 on a bipartisan basis, \nover 200 organizations gave their wholehearted support for this \nlegislation. This includes many leading patient advocacy organizations \nsuch as the Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Research, the \nJuvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric \nAids Foundation, the Christopher Reeve Foundation, the American \nAssociation for Cancer Research, and the Alliance for Aging Research, \nto name a few.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na list of organizations that support the passage of H.R. 810.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 14, 2006.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: We, the undersigned patient advocacy groups, \n     health organizations, research universities, scientific \n     societies, and other interested institutions and \n     associations, representing millions of patients, scientists, \n     health care providers and advocates, write you with our \n     strong and unified support for H.R. 810, the Stem Cell \n     Research Enhancement Act. We urge your vote in favor of H.R. \n     810 when the Senate considers the measure next week.\n       Of the bills being considered simultaneously, only H.R. 810 \n     will move stem cell research forward in our country. This is \n     the bill which holds promise for expanding medical \n     breakthroughs. The other two bills--the Alternative \n     Pluripotent Stem Cell Therapies Enhancement Act (S. 2754) and \n     the Fetus Farming Prohibition Act (S. 3504)--are NOT \n     substitutes for a YES vote on H.R. 810.\n       H.R. 810 is the pro-patient and Pro-research bill. A vote \n     in support of H.R. 810 will be considered a vote in support \n     of more than 100 million patients in the U.S. and substantial \n     progress for research.

Mr. President, support for the passage of H.R. 810 is not \nlimited to the not-for-profit sector. While it is sometimes typical for \nthe private sector to keep out of some controversial issues, this is \nnot the case with stem cell research.\n  Last week, I received a letter of support for H.R. 810 from the \nBiotechnology Industry Organization. BIO represents more than 1,100 \nbiotechnology companies, state biotechnology centers, and academic \ninstitutions. The BIO letter notes:\n\n       Expanded support of embryonic stem cell research could also \n     go a long way toward reducing the time and expense needed to \n     develop drugs because new chemical or biological compounds \n     meant to treat diseases could be tested in specific human \n     cells prior to their use in live human beings.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe July 12, 2006, letter from BIO calling for passage of H.R. 810.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Biotechnology Industry\n\n\n                                                 Organization,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 12, 2006.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: As President & CEO of the Biotechnology \n     Industry Organization (BIO), I am writing to express BIO's \n     support for H.R. 810, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. \n     Other stem cell legislation being debated by the Senate has \n     merit, but only H.R. 810 expands the research that our \n     nation's leading scientists believe holds the promise of \n     finding cures and treatments for the millions of patients who \n     currently suffer from a variety of diseases and disabilities.\n       BIO is the national trade association representing more \n     than 1,100 biotechnology companies, academic institutions, \n     state biotechnology centers and related organizations in all \n     50 U.S. states and 33 foreign nations. BIO members are \n     involved in the research and development of health-care, \n     agricultural, industrial and environmental biotechnology \n     products.\n       Our nation's top scientists agree that embryonic stem cell \n     research has the potential to lead to cures and treatments \n     for many of our society's most devastating diseases and \n     disabilities such as cancer, diabetes, ALS, Parkinson's \n     disease, Alzheimer's disease, and spinal cord injuries. \n     Embryonic stem cell research will further the development of \n     cell-based therapies by leading to greater scientific \n     understanding of cell differentiation--the process by which \n     our cells become specialized to perform certain functions--\n     and proliferation--the process where cells expand, or \n     multiply for controlled use as a potential therapeutic.\n       Expanded support of embryonic stem cell research could also \n     go a long way toward reducing the time and expense needed to \n     develop drugs because new chemical or biological compounds \n     meant to treat diseases could be tested in specific human \n     cells prior to their use in live human beings.\n       Importantly, the legislation creates an ethical framework \n     for this research. It prohibits funding unless the cell lines \n     were derived from excess embryos from in vitro fertilization \n     clinics that were created for reproductive purposes and would \n     otherwise be discarded. It also requires voluntary informed \n     consent from the couples donating the excess embryos and \n     prohibits any financial inducements.\n       H.R. 810 provides hope to millions of patients and their \n     families by expanding current federal policy regarding \n     federal funding of stem cell research. I urge you to support \n     its passage.\n       If you have any questions, please feel free to call me or \n     Brent Del Monte, BIO's Vice President for Federal Government \n     Relations, at 202-962-9200.\n       Thank you for your attention to this important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           James C. Greenwood,\n\n                                                  President & CEO,\n                              Biotechnology Industry Organization.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, some aspects of this issue involve \ncomplicated scientific facts and complex moral questions. Elected \nofficials and the American public alike have had much to learn and \nconsider since this issue first arose on the scene in 1998.\n  The more the American public thinks about this issue, the more it \ncoalesces around the policy embraced by H.R. 810 which will \nsignificantly improve and expand taxpayer supported stem cell research.\n  Public opinion polls show that U.S. citizens are squarely behind stem \ncell research and H.R. 810.\n  For example, a poll commissioned by the Coalition for the Advancement \nof Stem Cell Research and taken in May of this year found that 72 \npercent of Americans support embryonic stem cell research and 70 \npercent favor the Senate adopting H.R. 810, the Stem Cell Research \nEnhancement Act. This finding of broad public support is consistent \nwith other previously conducted polls. For example, a Harris poll taken \nin August 2004 found that 73 percent of Americans think stem cell \nresearch should be allowed and a June 2004 Wall Street Journal/NBC News \npoll placed public support for this research at 71 percent.\n  Some may try to quibble about how particular poll questions were \nphrased in particular surveys, but few would question the fact that for \nsome time most Americans have wanted the type of research that H.R. 810 \nwill help enable to go forward.\n  I can tell you this. The poll results I have just cited are \nconsistent with what I hear from my neighbors and constituents in Utah. \nI come from a conservative State. But whenever the issue of stem cell \nresearch comes up at one of my meetings in Salt Lake City or other \nplaces in my State, somebody will come up to me to tell me their \npersonal story with the diseases of a loved one and tell me that I am \ndoing the right thing on stem cell research.\n  One of the reasons why I got involved with the issue of stem cell \nresearch in the first place was because of a little boy named Cody \nAnderson, whose family used to live in West Jordan, UT.\n  Cody and his family came to visit me in Washington in 2001 to tell me \ntheir tragic family struggle with diabetes. Cody's grandfather \nsuccumbed to diabetes at age 47 after a series of painful amputation \noperations. Cody, his grandfather's namesake, never got the chance to \nmeet or know his grandfather because of diabetes.\n\n[[Page S7658]]\n\n  Let me read you part of a letter that Cody and his family wrote me:\n\n       I don't want other small children like me to have to go \n     through the things that I have already had to go through. I \n     do not want to suffer the effects that my grandfather did \n     throughout his life because of this disease. I want to grow \n     old and not have to worry about all the bad things that could \n     happen to me because of diabetes. We have seen what diabetes \n     can do to an innocent life. Please don't let this happen to \n     me in my life now. I hope you will take it in your hearts to \n     listen to us, the people who live with this disease for every \n     minute of every day for now and the rest of our lives.\n\n  In a few hours we can pass a bill that can only help Cody and \nthousands of others suffering from diabetes and millions of others who \nsuffer from other diseases and conditions that may benefit from stem \ncell research.\n  How do you think young Cody's parents felt when they learned of their \nson having the same diagnosis as his grandfather?\n  How would you feel if you were told that your child would lead a life \nrevolving around multiple daily blood tests, insulin injections, and a \ntightly regulated diet and constricted activity schedule that no child \nwould relish?\n  The answer of any parent is that you would want your government to \nleave no stone unturned in finding a cure for that disease. And you \nwould want the cure found as soon as possible.\n  Let me say a few sobering words about the immediacy of the promise of \nstem cell research. Cures are not around the corner. While stem cell \nresearch may prove in time to be a revolutionary advance in science \nsuch progress does not come quickly or on the cheap.\n  If we start a vigorous program of federally funded stem cell research \nprogram progress will not likely be measured in hours and days. It will \ntake years, perhaps 10 or 20 years, before American patients are \nadministered a new class of products and treatments derived from stem \ncell research.\n  In this regard I am reminded of an instance in which, when advised \nthat a certain type of rare plant took years and years to bloom if \nplaced in a certain hostile environment, a great French General simply \nsaid, ``Then we must not delay, we must plant today.''\n  We have to proceed with stem cell research with a passion and urgency \ntoday precisely because we do not know how long it will take to find \ntomorrow's cure. But we do know that the sooner we start, the faster we \nwill get there.\n  Nor will this research be inexpensive. No doubt one reason why the \nbiotechnology industry is supporting H.R. 810 is because since the end \nof World War II basic biomedical research in this country has primarily \nbeen funded by taxpayers through the programs conducted or supported by \nthe National Institutes of Health. Today, about 80 percent of the $28 \nbillion NIH budget is invested in highly-competitive, peer-reviewed \nresearch that is undertaken by universities and research hospitals.\n  There has been a continuum of effort between the public sector basic \nresearch and private sector applied research that attempts to translate \nthe new basic knowledge gleamed from federally supported NIH research \ninto tangible FDA-approved products or other treatments before they can \nreach even the first patient's bedside. Americans should take pride in \nthe fact that virtually every major advance in the biological sciences \nin the last 50 years emanated in some way from our investment in the \nNIH.\n  In my view, it would be in tragic and nearly incalculable mistake for \nour country to continue our present policy that materially constricts \nthe cadre of investigators leading over 46,000 ongoing university \nbased, NIH research grants from pushing the envelope of stem cell \nresearch. To cede our leadership in such a promising field of endeavor \nof biomedical research as stem cell research can only be shortsighted \nin the long run.\n  For example, the University of Utah is the proud home of one of the \nworld's foremost mouse stem cell researchers. His name is Dr. Mario \nCapecchi and he has already won one of the most prestigious awards in \nAmerican science, the Lasker Award. A great deal of the support for Dr. \nCapecchi and other researchers at the University of Utah and other \nresearch universities across the country come from NIH grants and \ncontracts.\n  I want Dr. Capecchi to stay in Utah. I want the world's leading \nscientists to stay in the United States. It is critical to relax the \ncurrent straitjacket on testing new stem cell lines if we are to keep \nthe best stem cell researchers in this country.\n  Some might say good riddance to this research and to stem cell \nresearchers. Look what happened in South Korea when a group of stem \ncell researchers conducted unethical experiments, faked the results and \nlied to the public.\n  I say that if the NIH is involved in this research and it is \nconducted in America, federally supported researchers will have to live \nwithin longstanding NIH ethical guidelines and principles as well as \nspecial rules that will apply only to stem cell research. In this way, \nas we have done so many times in the past with breakthrough research \nsuch as with recombinant DNA technology and organ transplants, the \nUnited States can help set a moral and ethical climate that our \nneighbors in the world community will emulate and follow.\n  I hope we never reach the day when the best biomedical researchers \ntrained in America must go elsewhere to conduct the most cutting-edge \nbasic biomedical research. Once that happens, we could face the day \nwhen sick Americans must actually leave our country to get the latest \nin treatments. I sure would not want to see a day when a citizen of \nSalt Lake City has to go to South Korea or any place else to get the \nbest medical treatment possible.\n  Today, for all of its warts, the U.S.A. is widely recognized as the \nworld's leader in developing and disseminating the latest in medical \nbreakthroughs.\n  Passage of H.R. 810 will help us keep it that way.\n  The purpose of H.R. 810 is to expand the opportunities for the type \nof federally funded basic biomedical research that has proven so \nbeneficial to the American public time and time again in the past.\n  Having described how many experts and interested parties believe that \nthe promise of stem cell research is so great, I want to spend the next \nfew minutes describing why some are opposed to this research and why I \nthink their opposition is misplaced.\n  In order to do this, I feel compelled to spend a few minutes to \ndefine and discuss some technical scientific terms. I know that others \nhave used many or all of these terms during the course of the debate \nbut please bear with me if I am repeating some one or get too \ntechnical.\n  Perhaps the best place to start a discussion of stem cell research is \nwith a broader term that many scientific experts believe more \naccurately describes the field and what is at stake.\n  The term is regenerative medicine.\n  Regenerative medicine seeks to uncover knowledge about how healthy \ncells contained in tissues and organs are formed and how they are lost \nthrough normal wear and tear or impaired more extensively through \ninjury or degenerative disease.\n  The growing field of regenerative medicine is increasing our \nunderstanding of embryonic development, birth defects, organ \ntransplantation, and the developmental biology of both healthy and \ndiseased tissues. A key avenue of research of regenerative medicine \ninvolves stem cells. A stem cell is an undifferentiated cell that has \nthe unique capacity to renew itself and give rise to specialized cell \ntypes. These stem cells are called pluripotent because of this ability \nto develop into different kinds of specialized cells, perhaps into all \nor most of the 200 known types of tissues that comprise the human body. \nStem cells have the ability to divide and replicate for long periods of \ntime in a laboratory colonies called cell lines.\n  The flexibility of these pluripotent stem cells is distinct from most \ncells in the body, because most cells are typically dedicated to \nperforming a specific task such as heart muscle cells and specialized \nnerve cells. Scientists, like Dr. Kerr, the Johns Hopkins nerve cell \nresearcher whom I talked about earlier, hope to be able to use stem \ncells to study how healthy and diseased cells work and, one day use \nthis knowledge and use stem cell lines to treat or repair diseased \ntissues or organs. If this research is successful, many currently \nuntreatable diseases and conditions may go the way of small pox and \npolio.\n  There are several different sources of stem cells.\n\n[[Page S7659]]\n\n  Adult stem cells are undifferentiated cells that are found in \nspecialized adult tissues. These cells can renew themselves and, with \ncertain limitations, can differentiate to yield all the specialized \ncells types of the tissue in which they are found, and perhaps others \nas well. Adult stem cells have been found in many tissues including \nbone marrow, blood, the brain, skeletal muscle, dental pulp, liver, \nskin, eye, and the pancreas.\n  There is no serious opposition to adult stem cell research. I fully \nsupport this research.\n  There is, however, much debate over the potential limitations of \nadult stem cell research. For example, the seminal 2001 National \nAcademy of Sciences study I mentioned earlier summarized the concerns:\n\n       (I)t is not clear whether . . . adult stem cells . . . \n     truly have plasticity or whether some tissues contain several \n     types of stem cells that each give rise to only a few \n     derivative types. Adult stem cells are rare, difficult to \n     identify and purify, and when grown in culture, are difficult \n     to maintain in the undifferentiated state. It is because of \n     those limitations that even stem cells from bone marrow, the \n     type most studied, are not available in sufficient numbers to \n     support many potential applications of regenerative medicine.\n\n  Although some opponents of H.R. 810 have taken exception to this \ncharacterization of the limitations of adult stem cells, it is my \nunderstanding that most experts in the field believe that embryonic \nstem cells offer advantages over adult stem cells because of the \nreasons I have just reported from the NAS study.\n  Moreover, some proponents of adult stem cell research claim that many \ndiseases have been effectively treated with adult stem cells. \nUnfortunately, the weight of evidence does not support many of these \nclaims. Nor do most of the leading experts in the field agree with the \nnotion that adult stem cell research exceeds the promise of embryonic \nstem cell research despite the fact that adult stem cell research has \nat least a 40-year head start on embryonic stem cell research and has \nenjoyed a sustained funding commitment from the NIH.\n  The current issue of Science magazine contains a detailed letter \nwritten by three scientists, Shane Smith, William Neaves, and Steven \nTeitelbaum challenging claims made by a leading advocate of adult stem \ncell research, Dr. David Prentice. I understand that most experts come \ndown on the Smith-Neaves-Teitlebaum side of the debate concerning the \nscientific limitations and opportunities of embryonic stem cells \nrelative to adult stem cells.\n  Additional sources of stem cells are those acquired from placental \nand umbilical cord blood. Last fall the Congress passed and President \nBush signed into law legislation that I co-authored to expand the use \nof the valuable and proven source of stem cell therapy. Due to the work \nof pioneers like Dr. Joanne Kurtzberg from Duke University and Dr. \nPablo Rubinstein of the New York Blood Center, cord blood has become an \nimportant mode of treatment for diseases like bone marrow disorders and \nhas proven to be particularly useful in the African-American community \nwhere it is often difficult to find suitable bone marrow matches.\n  Yet another source of stem cells is those derived from human embryos. \nPublic debate and discussion have centered on two types of embryonic \nstem cells.\n  First, stem cells may be derived from embryos created for, but no \nlonger needed in, the in vitro fertilization process.\n  Second, stem cells can potentially be derived from so-called cloned \nembryos through the process of somatic cell nuclear transfer.\n  Today's debate centers on the first source of embryonic stem cells--\nexcess embryos formed in fertility clinics slated for destruction.\n  Under the terms of the unanimous consent agreement--and it is an \nagreement I fully support and commend Senators Frist and Reid for \nnegotiating--the bills we debate today do not involve cloned embryos \nformed by somatic cell nuclear transfer. This is the process whereby \nthe nucleus of an egg and its complement of 23 chromosomes is removed \nand replaced with the nucleus of one of the standard 46-chromosome \ncontaining somatic cells that constitute the 200-plus tissues of the \nhuman body.\n  Senator Feinstein and others have developed legislation that would \nban and criminalize the act of using the somatic cell nuclear transfer \nprocess to give birth to a cloned human being. In addition, our bill, \nthe Human Cloning Ban and Stem Cell Research Protection Act, S. 876, \nwould set forth a tightly defined set of ethical restrictions and NIH \noversight for anyone in the private sector that undertakes somatic cell \nnuclear transfer in order to produce new stem cell lines.\n  Others, led by Senator Brownback, have offered legislation that would \neffectively ban somatic cell nuclear transfer altogether, even purely \nfor research purposes and even with tight ethical controls that will \ngovern wholly private sector funded experiments.\n  One day we will have that debate. We will not have it today under the \nrules of this debate. As I will describe, those opposed to deriving \nadditional stem cell lines through the somatic stem cell process also \noppose using spare embryos as a source of additional stem cell lines \nand do so for the same basic argument.\n  The great topic of today's debate is whether it is ethical and proper \nfor taxpayer funded scientists to use stem cells derived from embryos \nno longer needed in fertility treatment.\n  The process of in vitro fertilization consists of fertilizing a \nwoman's egg in a laboratory and then placing the fertilized egg in a \nwoman's womb so that gestation and childbirth can occur. This is what \nis done when couples have fertility problems. Although IVF procedures \nwere very controversial when they were first developed and used back in \n1983, over 200,000 Americans have been born through this technique that \nis widely accepted today.\n  Many had grave reservations about the IVF process when it was \ndeveloped. Some of the fiercest opponents of IVF back then are also the \nmost ardent opponents of S. 810. While I respect their views--and these \nare sincere and earnest individuals--I think they were wrong then and \nwrong now.\n  As part of the fertility treatment process, it is inevitable that \nthere will be some test tube embryos that will not be needed and will \nnever be implanted in a mother's womb. And let me be clear here, I \nbelieve that the highest and best use of a human embryo is to be used \nby loving parents to add to their family. I wholeheartedly support \nadoption of spare embryos and would give adoption precedence over use \nfor research. I think most would agree with me on this.\n  But the fact of the matter today is that there may exist at any point \nin time more than 400,000 such unused embryos in the United States and \neach year tens of thousands of such spare embryos are routinely and \nunceremoniously discarded and destroyed. It is important to note that \nmore than 11,000 of these embryos have already been used for research.\n  It is from these embryos that scientists have derived stem cell \nlines.\n  Here is how it works.\n  During the first few days of embryo development, whether in a \nmother's womb or in a Petri dish inside a fertility clinic, the \nfertilized egg--called a zygote--begins to divide and transform into a \nsphere of cells called a blastocyst. Depending on its stage of \ndevelopment, a blastocyst is comprised of about 30 to 150 cells. It is \nfrom the inner layer of the blastocyst that scientists can derive the \nunspecialized but pluripotent stem cells that hold so much promise.\n  As I said earlier, while there is some debate on this issue, the \ngreat bulk of the evidence and consensus view of leading experts is \nthat, at this point in time, research on the embryonic stem cells holds \nat least as much, and probably a lot more, promise than research on \nadult stem cells and cord blood. That is because the experts believe \nthat embryonic stem cells appear to be easier to identify and work with \nand appear to be more flexible than other sources of stem cells.\n  The sole purpose of H.R. 810 is to expand the number of stem cell \nlines eligible for Federal funding. If H.R. 810 passes and is signed \ninto law, Americans will finally get the vigorous program of federally \nfunded stem cell research complete with a rigorous system of Federal \noversight of the ethical protections that the National Institutes of \nHealth will place on this research.\n\n[[Page S7660]]\n\n  The policy dispute that requires the legislative fix set forth in \nH.R. 810 revolves around the moral status of a spare embryo. Some, \nincluding President Bush and some in Congress, have reservations about \nusing stem cells derived from embryos for research purposes. This \nconcern is anchored in the perspective that human life begins at the \nmoment of conception, be it in the womb or in the lab of a fertility \nclinic.\n  While I respect this view and those who hold it, I do not agree with \nit.\n  Let me say that I come into this debate as longtime, right-to-life \nSenator. I oppose abortion on demand. I think that Roe v. Wade was \nwrongly decided. I have worked to return the power to outlaw abortion \nfrom the courts to the states. In 1981, I proudly worked to report an \nanti-abortion constitutional amendment from the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  In the 108th Congress, I served as chairman of the House-Senate \nConference Committee that finalized long-overdue legislation to outlaw \nthe barbaric practice of partial birth abortion. I was at the \nPresident's side when he signed this bill into law.\n  When it comes to a right-to-life philosophy, I do not take a back \nseat to anyone in this Chamber or the House of Representatives. I will \nput my pro-life track record up against anyone inside or outside of \nCongress.\n  When I considered the question of the moral status of stem cells \ncreated for, but no longer needed in, the in-vitro fertilization \nprocess, I did so from a long and fervently held pro-life philosophy.\n  I have discussed this issue with many experts in science and ethics \non all sides of this issue. I spoke to many Utahns and other citizens \nabout their views on this matter. I consulted books ranging from \nmedical texts and the Bible.\n  I thought long and hard about this matter.\n  Sometimes, I simply prayed to God for guidance.\n  I take my pro-family, pro-life philosophy very seriously.\n  I believe the worth of each soul is absolute.\n  Accordingly, I reject any purely utilitarian argument that the \npromise of stem cell research is so great that the ends justify the \nmeans.\n  I do not think that research can ever justify the taking of even a \nsingle human life, no matter how frail or defenseless that person may \nbe.\n  Let me just say that there is not a fairer or finer man in the U.S. \nSenate than my friend from Kansas, Senator Sam Brownback. As he has \nattempted to frame the issue:\n\n       The central question in this debate is simple: Is the \n     embryo a person or a piece of property? If you believe . . . \n     that life begins at conception and that the human embryo is a \n     person fully deserving of dignity and the protection of our \n     laws, then you have to believe that we must protect this \n     innocent life from harm and protection.\n\n  After much thought, reflection, and prayer, I concluded that life \nbegins in, and requires, a nurturing womb. Human life does not begin in \na Petri dish.\n  I do not question that an embryo is a living cell.\n  But I do not believe that a frozen embryo in a fertility clinic \nfreezer constitutes human life.\n  To my knowledge, as a matter of law, no member of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt has ever taken the position in even a dissenting opinion, let \nalone a majority opinion, that fetuses, let alone embryos, are \nconstitutionally protected persons.\n  I cannot imagine, for example, that many Americans would view an \nemployee of a fertility clinic whose job it is to destroy unneeded \nembryos as a criminal--and a murderer at that. Yet this is a task that \nis performed thousands of times each and every year by hundreds of \nfertility clinic employees.\n  As well, the logical extension of Senator Brownback's life-begins-at-\nconception view might be to criminalize the actions of a woman or her \ndoctor from using, or recommending the use of, some longstanding forms \nof contraception that impede fertilized eggs from attaching onto the \nuterine wall.\n  I simply do not believe that passing H.R. 810 and allowing federally \nfunded researchers to use new stem cell lines derived from spare \nembryos from fertility clinics is somehow ethical.\n  It seems to me that you would have to believe that the in vitro \nfertilization process was unethical to begin with if you believe that \nit is unethical to use spare embryos that would never be used for \nfertility purposes and were slated for routine destruction.\n  I find both fertility treatment and embryonic stem cell research to \nbe ethical.\n  I believe that being pro-life involves helping the living.\n  Regenerative medicine is pro-life and pro-family; it enhances, not \ndiminishes human life.\n  My friend and colleague, Senator Gordon Smith, and I share a similar \nperspective on this important issue. Here is Senator Smith's eloquent \nresponse to the concerns raised by our friend, Senator Brownback:\n\n        . . . when does life begin? Some say it is at conception. \n     Others say it is at birth. For me in my quest to be \n     responsible and to be as right as I know how to be, I turn to \n     what I regard as sources of truth. I find this: ``And the \n     Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed \n     into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living \n     soul.'' This allegory of creation describes a two-step \n     process to life, one of the flesh, the other of the spirit . \n     . . Cells, stem cells, adult cells, are, I believe, the dust \n     of the earth. They are essential to life, but standing alone \n     will never constitute life. A stem cell in a petri dish or \n     frozen in a refrigerator will never, even in 100 years, \n     become more than stem cells. They lack the breath of life. An \n     ancient apostle once said: ``For the body without the spirit \n     is dead.'' I believe that life begins in the mother's womb, \n     not in a scientist's laboratory. Indeed, scientists tell me \n     that nearly one-half of fertilized eggs never attach to a \n     mother's womb, but naturally slough off. Surely, life is not \n     being taken here by God or by anyone else.\n\n  I find much wisdom in Senator Smith's remarks and ask all of you to \nreflect upon his thoughtful and valuable perspective.\n  When the roll is called on H.R. 810, I will vote yea. I urge my \ncolleagues to do likewise.\n  I applaud President Bush's decision to allow Federal funds to be used \nin connection with a limited number of stem cell lines that preexisted \nhis August 9, 2001 speech. Frankly, I had hoped back in 2001 that \nPresident Bush would announce a more expansive policy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter I wrote to President Bush on this matter in June, 2001 on the \nissue of stem cell research as well as an accompanying letter to then \nSecretary of Health and Human Services, Tommy Thompson.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 13, 2001.\n     The President George Walker Bush,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I urge you to support federal funding \n     of human pluripotent embryonic stem cell research. Upon \n     substantial reflection, I find--and hope you will as well--\n     that proceeding with this research is in the best interests \n     of the American public and is consistent with our shared pro-\n     life, pro-family values.\n       After carefully analyzing the factors involved, I conclude \n     that, at this time, research on human pluripotent embryonic \n     stem cells is legal, scientifically compelling, and ethically \n     sound. I want to emphasize that my support for such research \n     is contingent upon adherence to the applicable statutes, \n     regulations and guidelines. For your information, I have \n     provided a copy of my correspondence to Secretary Thompson \n     that more fully explains my reasoning on this important \n     matter.\n       Mr. President, one of the great legacies of your father's \n     Presidency was the fall of the Berlin Wall which represented \n     the victory of democracy in a 50-year battle with \n     totalitarian regimes. Through sacrifice and love of country \n     ``the Greatest Generation'' prevailed over both fascism and \n     communism and proved more than equal to the challenges of the \n     times. As a result, today the United States is in a unique \n     position of leadership in the world. How America exerts this \n     influence and invests our resources and energies will be \n     observed closely by all of our global neighbors. It seems to \n     me that leading the way in finding new cures for disease is \n     precisely the type of activity that accrues to our benefit \n     both at home and abroad.\n       In the opening days of your term in office, scientists have \n     completed the task of sequencing the human genome. While this \n     acccomplishment--the work of many in the public and private \n     sectors--is of historical significance, it is only the end of \n     the beginning in a new era of our understanding of the \n     biological sciences, Over your next eight years in office, \n     you have an unprecedented opportunity to provide the personal \n     leadership required to see to it that your Administration \n     will be remembered by future historians as the beginning of \n     the end for such deadly and debilitating diseases as cancer, \n     Alzheimer's, and diabetes.\n\n[[Page S7661]]\n\n       To accomplish this, all promising and proper avenues of \n     research must be explored. Throughout my career I have been \n     proud to have worked with patients and families struggling \n     with the daily realities of disabling high prevalence \n     illnesses such as cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. As \n     author of the Orphan Drug Act, I also am proud that over 200 \n     drugs have been approved since this law was enacted in 1984 \n     for such small population, but devastating diseases, as \n     Hemophilia, Cystic Fibrosis, and ALS. In my 25 years of \n     working to sustain and build America's formidable biomedical \n     research enterprise, I have rarely, if ever, observed such \n     genuine excitement for the prospects of future progress than \n     is presented by embryonic stem cell research.\n       Mr. President, once you have considered the complexities of \n     the questions at hand, I hope you will conclude, as other \n     pro-life, pro-family Republicans such as Strom Thurmond, \n     Gordon Smith, Connie Mack, and I, that the best course of \n     action is to lead the way for this vital research.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Orrin G. Hatch,\n     United States Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 13, 2001.\n     Hon. Tommy G. Thompson,\n     Secretary of Health and Human Services,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: I am writing to express my views \n     regarding federal funding of biomedical research involving \n     human pluripotent embryonic stem cells. After carefully \n     considering the issues presented, I am persuaded that such \n     research is legally permissible, scientifically promising, \n     and ethically proper. Therefore, at this time, I support the \n     use of federal funds to conduct research involving human \n     pluripotent stem cells derived from embryos produced through \n     the in vitro fertilization process. My support is, of course, \n     conditioned upon such research being conducted in strict \n     accordance with the relevant statutes and the protections set \n     forth in the applicable regulations and guidelines, including \n     those issued by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n       I am mindful that this is a matter over which reasonable, \n     fair-minded persons may ultimately disagree. Despite this \n     likely outcome, I believe it constructive for public dialogue \n     to take place over this issue. For that reason, I recommend \n     that you convene the National Institutes of Health Human \n     Pluripotent Stem Cell Review Group (HPSCRG) or a similar \n     expert advisory body to help bring resolution to this matter. \n     The HPSCRG, to be chaired by Dr. James Kushner of the \n     University of Utah, can become a key forum to provide \n     information and advice for policymakers.\n       At the outset, let me be clear about one of my key \n     perspectives as a legislator: I am pro-family and pro-life. I \n     abhor abortion and strongly oppose this practice except in \n     the limited cases of rape, incest, and to protect the life of \n     the mother. While I respect those who hold a pro-choice view, \n     I have always opposed any governmental sanctioning of a \n     general abortion on demand policy. In my view, the adoption \n     of the Hyde Amendment wisely restricts taxpayer financed \n     abortions. Moreover, because of my deep reservations about \n     the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade, I proposed--\n     albeit unsuccessfully--an amendment to the Constitution in \n     1981 that would have granted to the states and Congress the \n     power to restrict or even outright prohibit abortion.\n       In 1992, I led the Senate opposition to fetal tissue \n     research that relied upon cells from induced abortions. I \n     feared that such research would be used to justify abortion \n     or lead to additional abortions. It was my understanding that \n     tissue from spontaneous abortions and ectopic pregnancies \n     could provide a sufficient and suitable supply of cells. \n     Unfortunately, experts did not find these sources of cells as \n     adequate for their research needs. Subsequently, the 1993 NIH \n     reauthorization legislation changed the legal landscape on \n     this issue.\n       Because of my strong pro-life beliefs, I am a co-sponsor of \n     the Unborn Victims of Violence legislation that makes it a \n     separate criminal offense to cause death of or bodily injury \n     to unborn children. I also support the Child Custody \n     Protection Act that addresses the problem of minors crossing \n     state lines to obtain abortions in avoidance of home state \n     parental consent or notification requirements. I have also \n     helped lead the effort to outlaw partial birth abortion, a \n     procedure I find to be particularly repugnant. I hope that \n     the l07th Congress will succeed in adopting, and transmitting \n     for the President's signature, legislation that will end late \n     term abortions unless necessary to save the life of the \n     mother.\n       I am proud of my strong pro-life, anti-abortion record. I \n     commend the Bush Administration for its strong pro-life, pro-\n     family philosophy. In my view research, on stem cells derived \n     from embryos first created for, but ultimately not used in, \n     the process of in vitro fertilization, raises questions and \n     considerations fundamentally different from issues attendant \n     to abortion. As I evaluate all these factors, I conclude that \n     this research is consistent with bedrock pro-life, pro-family \n     values. I note that our pro-life, pro-family Republican \n     colleagues, Senators Strom Thurmond and Gordon Smith, as well \n     as former Senator Connie Mack, support federal funding of \n     embryonic stem cell research. It is my hope that once you \n     have analyzed the issues, you will agree with us that this \n     research should proceed.\n\n\n                          The Legal Framework\n\n       After reviewing the relevant statutes and regulations, I \n     conclude that there is no mandatory legal barrier under \n     federal law to federal funding of research on human \n     pluripotent embryonic stem cells. On January 15, 1999, the \n     then-General Counsel of the Department of Health and Human \n     Services, Harriet Raab, issued a legal opinion regarding \n     federal funding for research involving human pluripotent stem \n     cells. This opinion summarized the applicable law as follows:\n       ``The statutory prohibition on the use of funds \n     appropriated to HHS for human embryo research would not apply \n     to research utilizing human pluripotent stem cells because \n     such cells are not within the statutory definition. To the \n     extent human pluripotent stem cells are considered human \n     fetal tissue by law, they are subject to the statutory \n     prohibition on sale for valuable consideration, the \n     restrictions on fetal tissue transplantation research that is \n     conducted or funded by HHS, as well as to the federal \n     criminal prohibition on the directed donation of fetal \n     tissue. Research involving human pluripotent stem cells \n     excised from a non-living fetus may be conducted only in \n     accordance with any applicable state or local law. Finally, \n     the Presidential Directive banning federal funding of human \n     cloning would apply to pluripotent stem cells, only if they \n     were to be used for that purpose.''\n       While some take exception to this reading of the law, I \n     believe that it sets forth a permissible interpretation of \n     the current state of the law with respect to research on \n     human pluripotent stem cells. I would also note that while \n     subsequent to the issuance of the HHS Legal Opinion in \n     January, 1999 attempts have been and are being made to change \n     the law, Congress has not passed a bill that has altered the \n     legal status quo. For example, Senator Brownback and others \n     have attempted to change the law to prohibit flatly such \n     research on fetal and embryonic stem cells. On the other \n     hand, Senator Specter and others have supported legislation \n     that would expand the range of permissible federally funded \n     research activities to include derivation of pluripotent stem \n     cells from totipotent stem cells. The considerable \n     disagreement over what the law in this area should be stands \n     in contrast to the common understanding of how the law has \n     been interpreted by the Department.\n       It is worth noting that NIH has a carefully crafted network \n     of regulations and guidelines that govern stem cell research. \n     These guidelines, finalized in the Federal Register, on \n     August 25, 2000 (65 FR 51976) were the subject of over 50,000 \n     public comments. Among the key provisions of these \n     requirements are:\n       NIH funds may only be used for research on human \n     pluripotent stem cells derived from embryos, if such cells \n     were derived from frozen embryos that were produced for the \n     purpose of procreation but subsequently were not intended to \n     be used for that purpose.\n       No financial or other inducements, including any promises \n     of future remuneration from downstream commercialization \n     activities, may be used to coerce the donation of the embryo.\n       A comprehensive informed consent must be obtained that \n     includes recognition that the donated embryo will be used to \n     derive human pluripotent stem cells for research that may \n     include transplantation research; that derived cells may be \n     stored and used for many years; that the research is not \n     intended to provide direct medical benefit solely to a donor \n     and that the donated embryo will not survive the derivation \n     process; and, there must be a distinct separation between the \n     fertility treatment and the decision to donate the embryos \n     for research.\n       The donation may not be conditioned on any restrictions or \n     directions regarding the individual who may receive the cells \n     derived from the human pluripotent stem cells.\n       All recipients of NIH funds to conduct stem cell research \n     must comply with guidelines and all laws and regulations \n     governing institutional review boards.\n       NIH funds may not be used to: clone a human being; derive \n     pluripotent stem cells from human embryos; conduct research \n     using pluripotent stem cells derived from a human embryo \n     created solely for research purposes; conduct research that \n     creates or uses pluripotent stem cells derived from somatic \n     cell nuclear transfer; or, combine human pluripotent stem \n     cells with an animal embryo.\n       If there is a need to further strengthen the applicable \n     guidelines and regulations, this should be done. But let us \n     recognize that there already exists a thorough and thoughtful \n     regulatory framework to build upon. It should also be noted \n     that these guidelines build upon an extensive body of earlier \n     work of the National Bioethics Advisory Committee, the \n     Advisory Committee to the Director, NIH, and a special Human \n     Embryo Research Panel convened by your predecessor. At this \n     juncture, it appears that NIH is developing its stem cell \n     research policies in an informed fashion within an area of \n     its expertise, and is operating within a statutory \n     environment such that, once finalized, the agency's actions \n     will likely survive legal challenge due to the deference the \n     courts grant these types of decisions.\n\n\n                      The Scientific Opportunities\n\n       Scientific experts believe that stem cells have tremendous \n     potential in benefiting human health. Stem cells are thought \n     to be a unique biological resource because these cells \n     apparently have the potential to develop into most of the \n     specialized cells and\n\n[[Page S7662]]\n\n     tissues of the body, including muscle cells, nerve cells, and \n     blood cells. As the American Association for the Advancement \n     of Science has characterized the promise of stem cell \n     research: ``Research on these cells could result in \n     treatments or cures for the millions of Americans suffering \n     from many of humanity's most devastating illnesses, including \n     Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, spinal cord injury, and heart \n     disease.'' Potentially, stem cell research can help virtually \n     every American family. It has been estimated that over 28 \n     million Americans are afflicted with conditions that may \n     benefit from embryonic stem cell research.\n       It is also worth noting in the pro-family context that stem \n     cell research is of particular interest to pediatricians. \n     Consider the views of Dr. Edward B. Clark, Chairman of the \n     Department of Pediatrics, University of Utah School of \n     Medicine:\n       ``. . . I can assure you that the scientific promise of \n     stem cell research is extraordinary.\n       ``In pediatrics, stem cell research offers therapy, and \n     indeed possibly a cure, for a wide variety of childhood \n     diseases, including neurologic disease, spinal cord injuries, \n     and heart disease . . .\n       ``I can think of nothing that will provide as much \n     meaningful therapy for children and children's problems than \n     the promise offered by stem cell research.''\n       ``We citizens of Utah are proud to be home of the Huntsman \n     Cancer Institute at the University of Utah. The medical \n     director of the Huntsman Cancer Institute, Dr. Stephen \n     Prescott, advises me that in his expert opinion stem cells \n     research `is an incredibly promising area that has potential \n     application in many different fields of medicine. One of \n     these is in the treatment of cancer, particularly as a way to \n     control the side effects following standard treatments.' ''\n       I am also aware that some believe, including highly-\n     respected scientists and many of my friends and colleagues in \n     the Right to Life community, that adult stem cells actually \n     hold greater promise than embryonic stem cells and that \n     research on adult stem cells should be pursued to the \n     exclusion of fetal or embryonic stem cells. It is my \n     understanding that, at the present time, the view that adult \n     stem cell research is sufficient or even scientifically \n     preferable to embryonic stem cell research is not the \n     predominant view within the biomedical research community.\n       While I have great admiration for, confidence in, and \n     strongly support America's biomedical research enterprise, \n     and I believe that our policy should be made on the best \n     science available, I am hardly one who invariably follows the \n     lead of what some may term ``the science establishment.'' \n     With Senator Harkin, I authored the legislation that created \n     the Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CCAM) \n     at NIH and believe there is great benefit in encouraging \n     challenges to scientific orthodoxy. Similarly, I authored the \n     Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act that set \n     parameters on how the Food and Drug Administration may \n     regulate dietary supplements as well as establishing the \n     Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) at NIH. To be sure, the \n     creation of CCAM and ODS had their fair share of critics at \n     NIH and among mainstream scientists. So be it.\n       In parallel to funding research on human pluripotent \n     embryonic stem cells, I believe it is essential to carry out \n     significant research on adult stem cells. I strongly urge the \n     Administration to continue to provide sufficient resources to \n     investigate fully the utility of adult stem cells as well \n     cells derived from adipose tissue.\n       Policymakers should also consider another advantage of \n     public funding of stem cell research as opposed to leaving \n     this work beyond the reach of important federal controls. \n     Federal funding will encourage adherence to all of the \n     safeguards outlined above by entities conducting such \n     research even when a particular research project is conducted \n     solely with private dollars.\n       I also think it important to recognize explicitly that the \n     knowledge gained through biomedical research can be harnessed \n     for critical pro-life, pro-family purposes. When one of our \n     loved ones is stricken by illness, the whole family shares in \n     the suffering. The quality of life for America's families can \n     improve as strides are made in biomedical research. This is \n     why we are making good on the bipartisan commitment to double \n     the funding of the NIH research program by 2003. I commend \n     the Administration for its leadership in allocating resources \n     for this worthy pro-life, pro-family purpose.\n\n\n                        Ethical Appropriateness\n\n       While society must take into account the potential benefits \n     of a given technological advance, neither scientific promise \n     nor legal permissibility can ever be wholly sufficient to \n     justify proceeding down a new path. In our pluralistic \n     society, before the government commits taxpayer dollars or \n     otherwise sanctions the pursuit of a field of research, it is \n     imperative that we carefully examine the ethical dimensions \n     before moving, or not moving, forward.\n       I would hope there is general agreement that modern \n     techniques of in vitro fertilization are ethical and benefits \n     society in profound ways. I have been blessed to be the \n     father of six children and the grandfather of nineteen \n     grandchildren. Let me just say that whatever success I have \n     had as a legislator pales in comparison to the joy I have \n     experienced from my family in my roles of husband, father, \n     and grandfather. Through my church work, I have counseled \n     several young couples who were having difficulty in \n     conceiving children. I know that IVF clinics literally \n     perform miracles every day. It is my understanding that in \n     the United States over 100,000 children to date have been \n     born through the efforts of IVF clinics.\n       Intrinsic with the current practice of IVF-aidcd \n     pregnancies is the production of more embryos than will \n     actually be implanted in hopeful mothers-to-be. The question \n     arises as to whether these totipotent embryonic cells, now \n     routinely and legally discarded-- amid, I might add, no great \n     public clamor--should be permitted to be derived into \n     pluripotent cells with non-federal funds and then be made \n     available for research by federal or federally-supported \n     scientists?\n       Cancer survivor and former Senator, Connie Mack, recently \n     explained his perspective on the morality of stem cell \n     research in a Washington Post op-ed piece:\n       ``It is the stem cells from surplus IVF embryos, donated \n     with the informed consent of couples, that could give \n     researchers the chance to move embryonic stem cell research \n     forward. I believe it would be wrong not to use them to \n     potentially save the lives of people. I know that several \n     members of Congress who consider themselves to be pro-life \n     have also come to this conclusion.''\n       Senator Mack's views reflect those of many across our \n     country and this perspective must be weighed before you \n     decide.\n       Among those opposing this position is Senator Brownback, \n     who has forcefully expressed his opinion:\n       ``The central question in this debate is simple: Is the \n     embryo a person, or a piece of property? If you believe that \n     life begins at conception and that the human embryo is a \n     person fully deserving of dignity and the protection of our \n     laws, then you believe that we must protect this innocent \n     life from harm and destruction.''\n       While I generally agree with my friend from Kansas on pro-\n     life, pro-family issues, I disagree with him in this \n     instance. First off, I must comment on the irony that stem \n     cell research--which under Senator Brownback's construction \n     threatens to become a charged issue in the abortion debate--\n     is so closely linked to an activity, in vitro fertilization, \n     that is inherently and unambiguously pro-life and pro-family.\n       I recognize and respect that some hold the view that human \n     life begins when an egg is fertilized to produce an embryo, \n     even if this occurs in vitro and the resulting embryo is \n     frozen and never implanted in utero. To those with this \n     perspective, embryonic stem cell research is, or amounts to, \n     a form of abortion. Yet this view contrasts with statutes, \n     such as Utah's, which require the implantation at a \n     fertilized egg before an abortion can occur.\n       Query whether a frozen embryo stored in a refrigerator in a \n     clinic is really equivalent to an embryo or fetus developing \n     in a mother's womb? To me, a frozen embryo is more akin to a \n     frozen unfertilized egg or frozen sperm than to a fetus \n     naturally developing in the body of a mother. In the case of \n     in vitro fertilization, extraordinary human action is \n     required to initiate a successful pregnancy while in the case \n     of an elective abortion an intentional human act is required \n     to terminate pregnancy. These are polar opposites. The \n     purpose of in vitro fertilization is to facilitate life while \n     abortion denies life. Moreover, as Dr. Louis Guenin has \n     argued: ``If we spurn [embryonic stem cell research] not one \n     more baby is likely to be born.'' I find the practice of \n     attempting to bring a child into the world through in vitro \n     fertilization to be both ethical and laudable and distinguish \n     between elective abortion and the discarding of frozen \n     embryos no longer needed in the in vitro fertilization \n     process.\n       In evaluating this issue, it is significant to point out \n     that no member of the United States Supreme Court has ever \n     taken the position that fetuses, let alone embryos, are \n     constitutionally protected persons. To do so would be to \n     thrust the courts and other governmental institutions into \n     the midst of some of the most private of personal decisions. \n     For example, the use of contraceptive devices that impede \n     fertilized eggs from attaching onto the uterine wall could be \n     considered a criminal act. Similarly, the routine act of \n     discarding ``spare'' frozen embryos could be transformed into \n     an act of murder.\n       As much as I oppose. partial birth abortion, I simply can \n     not equate this offensive abortion practice with the act of \n     disposing of a frozen embryo in the case where the embryo \n     will never complete the journey toward birth. Nor, for \n     example, can I imagine Congress or the courts somehow \n     attempting to order every ``spare'' embryo through a full \n     term pregnancy.\n       Mr. Secretary, I greatly appreciate your consideration of \n     my views on this important subject. I only hope that when all \n     relevant factors are weighed both you and President Bush will \n     decide that the best course of action for America's families \n     is to lead the way to a possible new era in medicine and \n     health by ordering that this vital and appropriately \n     regulated research proceed.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Orrin G. Hatch,\n                                            United States Senator.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, although at one time it appeared that as \nmany as 78 stem cell lines might qualify under the President's policy, \nas many had feared, the number of lines that might be practically \naccessed today is no more than around a dozen at best. Moreover, all of \nthese cell lines were\n\n[[Page S7663]]\n\ngrown with so-called mouse feeder cells so could never pass muster with \nthe FDA for use to make products for humans. Thus for the President's \ninitial goals to be accomplished, new embryonic stem cell lines must be \nmade available.\n  It has been over a year since he House has taken its historic action \nof passing H.R. 810 by a bipartisan 235-to-189 vote. I commend the \nleadership of Representatives Mike Castle and Diana DeGette for moving \nthe bill through the House.\n  I must pay special respects to Senator Arlen Specter and Senator Tom \nHarkin for their dogged determination in conducting a series of some 15 \noversight hearings on the issue of stem cell research since this \nbreakthrough science was first reported in 1998. In fact, it was the \nwork of the Specter-Harkin Labor-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee that \ndeveloped the factual basis and legal analysis that resulted in the \nlegislation that became H.R. 810.\n  At long last, today the Senate will finally vote on this important \nlegislation.\n  I hope that it will pass and if it does, I will strenuously urge \nPresident to reconsider his position and sign this bill into law.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am awaiting the arrival shortly of \nSenator Lautenberg on our side, but in the meantime I thank Senator \nHatch for the eloquent statement he made, to thank him for his long-\ntime support of this endeavor to open more stem cell lines for \nresearch. It shows clearly, as I said earlier today, this is not a \npartisan issue. I see no real partisan cleavage lines anywhere. It was \npassed with a bipartisan majority in the House. The leader in the House \nwas Congressman Mike Castle, a Republican from Delaware. The Democrat \nwas Congresswoman Diana DeGette from Colorado. Our leader here is \nSenator Specter, leader on the bill, and I am his counterpart on the \nDemocrat side. We have had great support from both sides of the aisle \non this legislation. I don't cast it in any type of partisan terms.\n  There are those who obviously spoke yesterday very eloquently about \ntheir moral objections to using embryos. But, again, I point out this \nbill does not create any new embryos. All we are talking about is using \nthe leftover embryos from in vitro fertilization and only if (a) the \ndonors give their written, informed consent; (b) that no money changes \nhands; and (c) that the embryo will never be implanted in a uterus and \nwill be discarded.\n  Fifty thousand healthy babies were born last year to couples who went \nto fertility clinics. Obviously, there are some embryos left over after \nthat. They are frozen. After the parents have the children they want to \nhave, they call the clinic or the clinic calls them and asks, do you \nwant to continue to pay to keep these embryos frozen; and they say, no, \nwe have our family. The clinic will then discard them. That is all we \nare talking about. Those embryos are going to be discarded, and with \nthe donor's written, informed consent. They can say, no, I don't want \nthem used for that, and then we wouldn't. You cannot induce anyone to \ndo that by saying we will pay you for it. This clearly has to be kept \nin mind, that this is what we are talking about in this legislation.\n  Senator Lautenberg of New Jersey is here. I yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa. I ask I \nbe notified when 4 minutes 30 seconds has passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this is one of those debates that \nmakes the American people scratch their heads and ask, what are those \npeople in Washington thinking about? From the perspective of everyday \npeople, this should not even be a debate. Of course we should fully \nfund research with embryonic stem cells because it has the potential to \nsave lives and alleviate the suffering of millions of Americans. It is \ncommon sense.\n  But our President is a captive of ideologs and extremists of his \npolitical party. Nearly 5 years ago President Bush enacted a policy \nthat made no scientific contribution, only political fodder for another \nelection. He put a stop to the development of new stem cell lines for \nresearch. It was a devastating blow to Americans suffering from \ndiabetes, cancer, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, and \nother injuries and diseases.\n  For many years, I have met with children stricken with juvenile \ndiabetes. We have established friendships, their parents and I, and the \nchildren and I. These children ask their parents, brothers, sisters, \nand me why the President won't allow research to move forward so their \ndisease can be cured. There is no decent answer I can give them.\n  When I ask them what the worst thing about living with diabetes is, \nthey respond plaintively, begging for help, so they can stop drawing \nblood from their finger six times a day. They are pleading to live \ntheir lives like other kids. One child said he is forbidden something \nso simple--to sleep at other friends' houses--because of the fear that \nhe will go into insulin shock.\n  I promised these kids I would do everything I possibly could to get \nthe message to the President of the United States, to help us find the \ncure for them. Today we have an opportunity, finally, to help these \nchildren.\n  It has been over 1 year since the House passed this bill. Why the \ndelay? There is no comprehensible reason. All we know is that people \nwanted to obstruct this discussion today. We can only wonder how many \npeople have had their hopes dashed and their spirits broken during that \nwasted year.\n  Americans in large majorities support stem cell research. I don't \nunderstand this ``fiddling while Rome burns'' policy. Seventy-two \npercent of Americans register support for embryonic cell research, a 3-\nto-1 margin over opposition. One of the most outspoken supporters of \nstem cell research is former First Lady Nancy Reagan. She spent 10 \nyears watching her husband's memory fade from life, probably not even \nrecognizing her. I have friends whose parents do not know who they are.\n  Virtually every major medical, scientific, and patient group supports \nembryonic stem cell research. In my home State of New Jersey, support \nfor stem cell research is overwhelming. We were the second State after \nCalifornia to authorize embryonic stem cell research. Unfortunately, \nPresident Bush has cut off Federal funding for those projects.\n  My colleague Senator Menendez and I recently visited the Coriell \nInstitute in Camden, NJ. They are not well known, but they were founded \nin 1953 and hold the world's largest collection of human cells for \nresearch. Coriell has everything in place to find cures and help \nmillions of people. But there is one problem: President Bush is \nundermining their efforts with his irrational policy on stem cell \nresearch.\n  Because of the scarcity of embryonic stem cell lines caused by his \nExecutive Order, the Coriell Institute in New Jersey had to go overseas \nto the Technion Institute in Israel to get access to an embryonic stem \ncell line so they could continue their research.\n  The President denies hope to millions of people based on his standard \nof ``ethics and morality.'' But what is ethical about denying a cure to \nchildren suffering from diabetes? What is moral about denying paralyzed \npeople the chance to walk again?\n  Any real, ethical issues are addressed by this bill. New stem cell \nlines will come from embryos donated by fertility parents under strict \nguidelines. There will not be embryos created for research.\n  What we are talking about in this bill are embryos that would \notherwise be disposed of--thrown away.\n  I believe compassion and common sense must prevail over rigid \nideology\n  If we pass this bill, I understand that the President intends to veto \nit. That would be a terrible and tragic mistake.\n  President Bush has never vetoed a bill. In the nearly 6 years of his \nPresidency--not one veto.\n\n[[Page S7664]]\n\n  What would it saw to the American people if his first veto was of a \nbill that could save millions of lives?\n  And I say to the American people: don't be fooled by the sleight of \nhand we are seeing today. There are three bills being considered but \nonly one of them matters.\n  The other two bills are part of a shell game. They are there to give \nPresident Bush something to sign.\n  But will those two bills do much to help the American with a shaky \nhand from being cured of Parkinson's disease?\n  Will those two bills make real strides toward relieving a child with \ndiabetes from the constant shots of insulin? I don't think so.\n  Only one bill can do that--the House stem cell bill. Let's vote to \napprove it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I hope our colleagues will look in the \nfaces of their children and their grandchildren and say: We do not want \nthem to be sick. And if they get sick, we want to help them. I hope \nthis bill will pass overwhelmingly.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield 9 minutes to the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, thank you very much. And I thank the \nSenator from Iowa for his real leadership on this issue.\n  This Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act debate is one of the most \nimportant debates the Senate will have in this year and in this decade. \nI believe this is such a great opportunity to be able to save lives. I \nbelieve it is like when we announced the endeavor to map the human \ngenome, like when we announced the national war against cancer. That is \nhow important this issue is.\n  I am a firm, unabashed supporter of stem cell research. It is a \ncornucopia of opportunity for new breakthroughs for some of the \ndiseases that are the most devastating and costly conditions facing \nthousands of Americans, including Alzheimer's disease, from which my \nfather died, diabetes, of which our family faces an inherent \npropensity, spinal cord injuries, which we see through accidents like \nChristopher Reeve had, and spina bifida, from which little children \nsuffer.\n  Stem cell research has the potential for saving lives, and we need to \nbe able to pursue it. I also would urge that this research be done in \nthe sunshine. One of the reasons we need a national framework is so it \nwill not be done in dark corners of the world without the United States \nof America participating.\n  We need a national framework to establish bioethical standards based \non sound science and ethical principles. I fear that without national \nstandards and national legislation, this could be conducted outside of \nthe public eye, without national and international scrutiny, where dark \nand ghoulish things could occur.\n  One of the reasons I came to the Senate was to help save lives. In my \nhome State, we are the home to the National Institutes of Health, the \nFederal Drug Administration, the University of Maryland, and also Johns \nHopkins University. I, every day, know that in my own home State they \nare working on new ideas for new cures. Whether it is to ensure that \nwomen have accurate mammograms to diagnose breast cancer, streamlining \nthe drug approval process so that lifesaving drugs can reach patients \nmore quickly, or fighting to double the budget at NIH, we have \nconsistently fought to improve the lives and health of the American \npeople.\n  This is why I am such an advocate of stem cell research. It holds the \npotential to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases, such as Alzheimer's \ndisease, Parkinson's disease, heart disease, all those autoimmune \ndiseases, such as MS and spinal cord injuries.\n  Just imagine if scientists could find a cure or the cognitive \nstretchout ability for Alzheimer's. Even giving individuals with a \ndisease a longer mental capacity would be a big breakthrough. Eighty \npercent of Medicaid costs go to paying for long-term care for seniors. \nEighty percent is primarily spent on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Think \nof just the financial savings we could have, let alone dealing with the \ntragedy in lives.\n  I, along with Senator Bond, am the lead sponsor of the Ronald Reagan \nbreakthrough legislation to sponsor breakthroughs. We have spoken \npersonally with Nancy Reagan, and she has endorsed this legislation, \njust as Senator Lautenberg has talked about. We need this opportunity \nto pursue the opportunity.\n  If we do not have national legislation, we are going to do it one \nState at a time. California has done it. My own home State of Maryland \nhas done it. But do you know what. There is $30 million here and $30 \nmillion there, but we do not have national standards, which means, can \nwe replicate the research? Can we have international cooperation?\n  For too long, this Federal health research has been operating with \none hand tied behind its back. Scientists have been prohibited from \ndoing embryonic stem cell research.\n  Five years ago, President Bush restricted Federal funding for \nembryonic stem cells. He said: Oh, we have these little lines, these \nlittle stem cell lines.\n  Those little stem cell lines did not turn out very well. The result \nis, federally funded research was almost halted. Stem cell research is \nconducted by private entities, and there are no national Federal \nbioethical standards.\n  I want bioethical standards. I want to ban human cloning. I want to \nmake sure the ghoulish is not done in laboratories.\n  I support the other legislation. We should not turn this into \nfinancial opportunity. We should sign it into pure opportunity.\n  What I like about this legislation is that it removes the \nrestrictions imposed by the Bush administration, but it does provide \nfor an ethical and medical framework and allows for sound science and \nsound ethics to be able to proceed. This ensures transparency and \npublic accountability. But most of all, it ensures opportunity.\n  When my father was in that nursing home and he could no longer \nrecognize me or the woman to whom he had been married for 50 years, it \ndid not matter that I was a Senator. There was no cure for Alzheimer's. \nIt did not matter that I could get five Nobel Prize winners on the \nphone because they did not have the answer.\n  My father, when he passed away, was a modest man. He would not have \nwanted big, lavish testimonials. What he would have liked to have had \nwas the fact that I cared enough to look out that no family would go \nthrough what we went through. And whether you were the First Lady of \nthe United States, like Nancy Reagan, and the first caregiver, or my \nmother, who was by my father's bed when he passed away, we watched what \nthat disease did. And now I will not stand patiently by and watch the \nopportunity to find a cure pass by.\n  So let's remember President Reagan. Let's remember the little guys \nlike Mr. Willy, who ran a grocery store in Highlandtown, and who looked \nout for his neighbors and for his girls, as he called his daughters. \nLet's look out for the American people and pass stem cell research.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of the time to the \nSenator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I welcome this vote on such an important \npiece of legislation, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. As we \nhave heard eloquently from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, \nstem cell research holds the promise of new cures and treatments for \ncountless diseases and millions of Americans with chronic, incurable \nconditions.\n  The wide range of applications for stem cells may lead to \nunparalleled achievements on behalf of research concerning Alzheimer's \ndisease, as my friend and colleague, Senator Mikulski, so passionately \ndescribed with respect to her own family and her own experience; spinal \ncord injuries, like my dear friend Christopher Reeve; diabetes, and \nother conditions.\n  For example, in my State of New York, research at Memorial Sloan-\nKettering Cancer Center has shown real\n\n[[Page S7665]]\n\npromise for the use of stem cell research in bone, cartilage, and \nmuscle replacement therapies. At Columbia University researchers have \nshown that stem cells can develop into neurons, special nervous system \ncells that would allow us to actually treat vision loss. Other \nscientists at Columbia University and at the University of Rochester \nMedical Center are working to cultivate stem cells into spinal cells \nthat control motor function as possible treatments for ALS, otherwise \nknown as Lou Gehrig's disease.\n  And researchers from Rockefeller University, also in New York City, \nhave explored ways in which stem cells can be used to develop dopamine-\nproducing cells which could help Americans living with Parkinson's \ndisease who experience a decline in these types of important cells.\n  A broad consensus in New York and across our country has brought us \nto this debate and vote. There has been an upsurge of demand. It has \ncrossed every line we can imagine, certainly partisan lines, ethnic, \nracial, geographic lines. People in every corner of our Nation are \ndemanding that we in Washington open the doors to this promising \nscience.\n  It is long overdue, but finally we are at this point. My friends, \nChristopher and Dana Reeve, whom we have lost in the last several \nyears, were eloquent, passionate advocates for this research. \nChristopher, from his wheelchair, performed his greatest role. He may \nhave been Superman in the movies, but he was a super human being after \nhis accident which paralyzed him, consigned him to a wheelchair to help \nwith his breathing and respiratory functions. But he never gave up.\n  He launched his greatest battle to try to bring our Nation to the \npoint where we would take advantage of the science that is there. He \nworked and struggled on behalf of all who might benefit from stem cell \nresearch and other scientific breakthroughs.\n  His brave, beautiful wife Dana, who passed away just this past March, \nshowed a devotion to her husband and her son that was just \ninspirational. She, too, continued Christopher's work through the Reeve \nFoundation. And I know that both of them are looking down upon this \ndebate and so pleased and relieved that this day has come.\n  As I travel around New York, I run into constituents who speak to me \nabout this issue. They are living with type I diabetes or their \nchildren are. They are suffering from Parkinson's. They have a relative \nwho is struggling with Alzheimer's. They are paralyzed from an \naccident, as Christopher was. And they believe that this holds promise \nfor their lives, for their futures, and if not for them in their \nlifetimes, certainly for their children and their grandchildren.\n  Yet we know that the work of researchers in New York and across our \ncountry has been stymied, has been held back by the ban on certain \nkinds of scientific research. In 2001, when President Bush put a stop \nto all Federal funding for this type of research, it was limited to \nusing already existing stem lines, which has proven to be a barrier to \nscientific advancement. We only have 20 lines, not 70 as was \nadvertised, that scientists can use. And the utility of these lines has \nbeen outstripped by the scientific advances made in the past 5 years.\n  But the ban still stands, and we have to pass this legislation. The \nHouse already did. We are now joining with the House. We need to have \nadditional stem cell lines in order to pursue the promising avenues for \nresearch. I am worried the President has signaled he intends to veto \nthis legislation, the first veto he will use since he has been \nPresident.\n  This research is not standing still around the world. We are looking \nat other countries putting billions of dollars into supporting stem \ncell science. They are creating establishments of all kinds, centers of \nresearch, special clinical centers because they know they can attract \nscientists from the United States who will come to pursue this \nresearch. We are losing ground instead of doing what Americans do best, \nleading the world in innovation, ingenuity, new ideas.\n  We can send this legislation to the President's desk, as I anticipate \nus doing after our vote this afternoon. And then the President has a \ndecision to make: Will he support the scientific community at this \nmoment of unequaled optimism and discovery or will he set us back?\n  I am going to support the other two bills that are going to be before \nus as well because I think we have to clearly put an ethical fence \naround this research, send a very clear message about what is permitted \nand what is not.\n  Right now we have no Federal laws prohibiting the worst of some of \nthis research. That is one of the results of the fact that we have an \nExecutive order, but we don't have any legal prohibitions on some of \nthe worst things people might decide to do. I think it is important \nthat we have a strong ethical stand, a strong legal stand, strong \nprohibitions and penalties for people who don't pursue research in the \nway that we set forth.\n  But we cannot make the progress that we need to make for the sake of \nnew treatments, new discoveries, and new hope for countless millions of \npeople who are alive today and are suffering, for those born with \ndiseases and conditions that could be ameliorated or even cured.\n  This is a delicate balancing act. I recognize that and acknowledge \nit. I respect my friends on the other side of the aisle who come to the \nfloor with grave doubts and concerns. But I think we have struck the \nright balance with the legislation we will vote on this afternoon. I \nthink we will make a serious mistake if the President vetoes this \nmeasure and sets this research back.\n  Mr. President, I hope we will pass it with a large margin, and I hope \nthat the President will allow it to become law so we can, once again, \nstand for those who need this help to face the suffering that they \nencounter while living day-to-day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, the majority yields 10 minutes to the \nSenator from Louisiana, and the Senator from Kansas will follow him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to H.R. 810, \nthe Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. First of all, I join with \neveryone in the Senate--in fact, everybody around the country--in \nsaying that, of course, we want to further research and opportunity for \nthe cure and the treatment of very serious illnesses. Of course, we \nwant to do everything possible, within a strong ethical framework, to \npush for that scientific research and that progress. But at least I \nwant to do that in a clear, certain, ethical framework. That is why I \nmust oppose the details of the provisions of H.R. 810.\n  Mr. President, I oppose it on two significant grounds. First of all, \nbecause one of my solemn duties in the Senate, I believe, is to protect \nand defend all human life--every case of human life, the beauty, the \nsanctity, and the importance of the individual which God has created.\n  Secondly, I do this in particular focusing on the fact that we are \ntalking about the use of taxpayer dollars. We are not merely talking \nabout what is allowed and disallowed. We are talking about the use of \ntaxpayer dollars for specific purposes, when some of these types of \nresearch are so utterly controversial in terms of the impact on \nindividual human lives.\n  Mr. President, a human embryo is a human life. I believe that to the \ncore of my being. It is at the initial stages of life and development, \nof course; but an embryo is a human life. Each and every one of us \nbegan as an embryo. Therefore, I firmly believe neither Congress nor \nindependent researchers, nor any human being, for that matter, should \nbe allowed to, in effect, play God by determining that one life is \ninherently more valuable than another, determining that one life should \nessentially be sacrificed for some other purpose, to advance the \nwelfare of other separate human lives.\n  Of course, supporters of embryonic stem cell research argue that this \nresearch only kills embryos that would be discarded anyway. But there \nare many cases that prove otherwise, where embryos have been adopted \nwhile still embryos or donated to infertile couples by their parents.\n  We know that as many as 99 families have adopted and given birth to \nchildren from those very same frozen embryos. These kids are often \nreferred to\n\n[[Page S7666]]\n\nas ``snowflake babies.'' They are beautiful, they are miracles. They \nremind us that, of course, we are talking about human life. How can we \njustify killing these tiny humans by saying that these embryos would be \ndiscarded anyway, when there is proof that, in some cases, they are not \ndiscarded, they are adopted. They grow up to be full, mature, healthy \nchildren, human beings.\n  Supporters of embryonic stem cell research argue that this research \nis essential to curing many diseases and federally funding it is our \nonly hope for curing diseases. I point out that there are many other \nalternatives. In fact, those alternatives are more promising, in many \nways, than the type of research we are debating today. The facts show \nthat adult stem cells have been used to perform at least 69 successful \ntreatments for human patients. So we have 69 treatments in human \npatients using adult stem cells which do not require the taking of \nhuman life. These were clinical applications, successful applications.\n\n  What is the experience in terms of embryonic stem cells? Zero \nsuccessful treatments in human patients, zero direct clinical \napplications.\n  There have been 25 years of this research, and there are still no \nsuccessful direct human clinical trials, and there have been many stops \nand starts and complications with regard to other research.\n  The following are some disorders and diseases with treatments from \nadult stem cell research that are worth noting: brain cancer, \ntesticular cancer, ovarian cancer, skin cancer, acute heart damage, \nmultiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, spinal cord injury, stroke \ndamage, Parkinson's disease, chronic liver failure, sickle cell anemia, \nend-stage bladder disease. Again, these were not just promising but \nsuccessful in many cases--human clinical trials that directly focus on \nthese very serious diseases.\n  So if one weighs all of these factors in the balance, I truly believe \nthat the thing to do is to respect all human life, to respect the very \nheartfelt feelings of millions upon millions, tens of millions of \nAmericans who have fundamental problems with this sort of research. \nAgain, it is worth underscoring that we are not debating whether this \nresearch can happen. We are debating if we are going to use taxpayer \ndollars to fund it, if we are going to forcibly take money from those \nAmericans who, like me, have fundamental moral reservations with the \nresearch and spend it on that very research.\n  I am happy to say that there is other legislation that we are \nconsidering today. I strongly support those two other bills. First of \nall, the Fetus Farming Prohibition Act, S. 3504, which prohibits the \ncreation and gestation of human beings for the purpose of harvesting \nspare organs, body parts, and tissue. Many people think fetus farming \nsounds akin to something out of a science fiction movie, and it does. \nBut it is already being explored in animals. This is something that is \nadvancing scientifically. Congress must prevent science from subjecting \nhuman beings to organ, body part, and tissue harvesting before it is \ntoo late.\n  The second bill which I proudly support today is the Alternative \nPluripotent Stem Cell Therapies Enhancement Act, S. 2754. It requires \nthat the NIH support research into alternative methods, other than \ndestroying human embryos, of creating pluripotent stem cells. These \npluripotent stem cells are valuable for treating diseases because they \nare capable of forming most or all of the tissues of the adult body.\n  So, again, this would forge a new path to make sure we explore other \navenues to create these stem cells that do not involve the destruction \nof precious embryos, human beings, human life. I believe this \nalternative path is far more productive. I believe it is far more in \nkeeping with upholding the values of our society, the very strongly \nheld belief of tens of millions of Americans who, like myself, have \nfundamental moral reservations with the destruction of individual human \nlife for these other purposes.\n  So I urge all of our Senate colleagues to join me and others in \nsupporting those two bills about ethical alternatives but in opposing \nthis underlying bill, H.R. 810, because it would involve the \ndestruction of individual, precious embryos, human life.\n  Mr. President, I don't come to this conclusion quickly or easily or \nrashly. Similar to virtually every American family, mine has been \ntouched by very serious diseases to which this research pertains. My \ndad had Parkinson's disease. He suffered with it for about 8 years. It \nwas very debilitating and, of course, eventually, similar to most folks \nwith Parkinson's disease, he passed from that and complications of it. \nWith that personal history, of course, I want to advance research in \nevery ethical way possible. But we must do it, again, in a strong, \nmoral framework. We must do it within clear, reasonable bounds, \nparticularly when we are talking about taxpayer funding of research.\n  I believe that defeating H.R. 810--but also passing the two bills \nthat set up alternative paths toward promising research--is the correct \nway to proceed. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in adopting that \npath.\n  With that, I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to advise me when I \nhave 2 minutes left. I want to start with a picture of Dennis Turner \nbecause this is a real-life case of Parkinson's disease. The prior \nspeaker, Senator Vitter, talked about his dad dying of Parkinson's \ndisease; it is a terrible disease. It is incredibly debilitating. I met \nwith a friend of mine last week who has something similar. It is not \nParkinson's, but it is also debilitating.\n  Dennis Turner testified at a hearing we had in the Senate Commerce \nCommittee. He had been cured of his symptoms for 5 years. We had \ndifficulty getting him in because he was out doing fun things such as \nsafaris. After a period of 5 years, the symptoms started to return. He \nhad received an adult stem cell therapy, not embryonic stem cell \ntherapy. His symptoms went away for 5 years, and then they started \ncoming back. He needed to have another treatment; he could not get it. \nInternational doctors--to try to get their help and support, we need to \nfund that type of work, which is working, for people like Dennis \nTurner.\n  My colleagues say we need to do this with embryonic stem cell \nresearch, that that is going to cure Dennis, Dennis Turner will be \ncured that way. I want to remind some of my colleagues that they said \nthis about fetal tissue research about 10 years ago in this debate. In \n1993, this was a typical statement debate at that time:\n\n       There is substantial evidence that fetal tissue research--\n\n  Taking a human embryo, fetal tissue, and let's work and mold and work \nwith this and put it inside a person, and let's deal with issues like \nParkinson's this way.\n\n     --will offer new hope of prolonged life, greater quality of \n     life, perhaps one day even a cure for many of these diseases, \n     and a tremendous economic and social cost-saving to the \n     country.\n  So we funded fetal tissue research for a long period of time, like we \nare funding embryonic stem cell research, to the tune of half a billion \ndollars over the last 5 years in human and animal models.\n  We funded fetal tissue research. Now, this is tissue and cells that \nare further developed than embryonic cells. They are further \ndifferentiated and they are more stabilized, so they go off in fewer \ntangents. So if they are put in some particular area of the body, like \nthey come from the brain, from the fetal tissue, and you put them back \nin the brain, they are more stable. We did this research. We funded \nthis. We even tried it in humans, to disastrous results--disastrous \nresults.\n  This is Parkinson's research set back by failure of fetal cell \nimplants. Disastrous side effects are the quotes from the people who \ndid the testing. Absolutely devastating. It was tragic, catastrophic. \nIt is a real nightmare. And we can't selectively turn it off. My \ngoodness, this is strong wording that is taking place, to be \ncatastrophic for fetal cell implants. Catastrophic? What happened? \nThese cells, the fetal cells, formed tumors, and in some cases these \ntumors, they were implanted in the brain, the fetal cells implanted in \nthe brain, and these tumors ended up being fingernail or hair that was \nin the brain, and we can't selectively turn it off.\n  Think about this just for a minute, if we could. Everybody is saying \nwe want to cure people. I want to cure people. If we have a route that \nis working in 72 different disease areas with the adult\n\n[[Page S7667]]\n\ncord blood--and here is real research we funded. We tried it in humans \neven, with fetal cells. These are further developed cells than \nembryonic. They formed tumors, to disastrous results in Parkinson's \npatients.\n  Yesterday, I entered into the Record a series of six one-page--this \nis the front-page summary of peer-reviewed articles on the formation of \ntumors using embryonic stem cells, and these were all articles saying: \nOK, we use embryonic stem cells; they formed tumors.\n  Now, I am not a scientist, but it seems that if you got it in fetal \ntissue, which was further developed cells, and you found out that these \nare wild and they grow too fast and they form in other areas, and you \nback it up to embryonic stem cells and they are even younger, more \nmalleable, and less formed, and we now have research saying they are \nforming tumors, you would look at that and say: Well, I don't think \nthis is working particularly well.\n  Now, it is interesting science. We may learn something of how the \ncell works in this process. I don't deny that at all. But if I am \nlooking for a cure for Dennis, and I have--I want a cure for Dennis. I \nwant something that works for him, and he has had a treatment that has \nworked for 5 years in him, in the adult field, and I have research that \nsays, in the embryonic field, it is going to form tumors, and I have \nresearch earlier in fetal tissue that says it did form tumors in \nhumans, how am I going to cure Dennis in this case by putting more into \nembryonic stem cell lines, taking precious dollars from adult stem cell \nwork and cord blood and putting it into a speculative field, the \nembryonic field, which is producing no results and, in fact, the \nresults it is producing are producing tumors? That doesn't seem to make \nmuch sense to me as far as how we would invest these sorts of dollars.\n  People are talking about spinal cord injuries, and I think we should \nbecause we are going to deal with this area. I hope that in the next 10 \nyears we are going to see for people, once they get a spinal cord \ninjury, there is an immediate therapy they have and it starts to knit \nthat spinal cord back together, so they are not waiting years and \nletting it further atrophy but immediately there is a therapy.\n  The therapy you see right here in Jacki Rabon--I have had her in to \nspeak at a press conference. This was a spinal cord injury accident--\nparaplegic from the hips down. Now she has feeling in her spinal cord. \nShe had to go overseas to get this treatment. It should have been done \nin America. It wasn't. Adult stem cells from the base of the nose--\nolfactory--taken, harvested, and put in. She is getting feeling. My \nguess is she is going to need several treatments.\n  Now, one of the greatest dismays we have is that a number of people \nare citing a rat model that has been shown on television of embryonic \nstem cells helping a rat to walk again. And that is fine. I am glad \npeople are showing it. But a lot more people know about this rat model \nthan know about Jacki Rabon. It seems as if there has been a media \nblackout on the adult stem cell successes and treatments and cord \nblood, and this rat has gotten all the publicity, even though we know \nthat if you do this in humans, you are going to form tumors. Why? Why \nwouldn't we embrace what is working and has no ethical problem?\n  I wish to close this section with a letter from a child. This is the \nfirst snowflake baby. This was a frozen embryo that was adopted--\nHannah. She wrote this last year. It is her letter. She is a pioneer. \nShe says: ``We're kids. I love you.'' X's and O's--hugs and kisses. I \nlove these letters. When my youngest daughter Jenna does them, they are \nabsolutely precious. Then she draws three faces. This is her face as an \nembryo. She is happy. She got adopted. She is no longer frozen. Here is \na sad face as an embryo that is still frozen, and her explanation of \nthis letter is he is sitting there frozen, hoping somebody adopts him. \nHere is a third face with a straight line, and her explanation is this \nis a young embryo saying: What, you are going to kill me?\n\n  This is a child's explanation of a frozen embryo. A frozen embryo \nthat is life, that is human life. If you destroy Hannah at this stage, \nyou don't get any sweet letters from Hannah to her parents. And we have \na lot of frozen embryos.\n  We are saying: Well, let's make some utility out of them. Isn't that \nagainst human dignity, to say, We will just research on this, when this \ncould be this child? This is this child? We don't need to do it. Even \nthe research we are funding in this area isn't working.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote against H.R. 810.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have listened to a lot of debate today, \nand I have heard a lot of statements. Let me just go through a few.\n  Cures are not around the corner; that is right. Embryonic stem cell \ngroups are now starting to realize they have years upon years upon \nyears to offer any hope of cure of any disease using embryonic stem \ncells.\n  Yesterday in the debate, I challenged those on the other side of this \nissue to deny the fact that the only way we will ever have a treatment \nwill be that you will have to clone yourself to be able to get a \ntreatment. Nobody has refuted that, and the reason they can't refute \nthat is because that is the only way embryonic stem cells will ever be \nsuccessfully used to treat a human condition. You will have to clone \nyourself. That raises all sorts of other ethical conditions.\n  The fact that cures are not around the corner with embryonic stem \ncells belies the fact that cures are here with adult stem cells, with \ncord blood stem cells, and it belies the fact that we are not \nrecognizing the latest advance just available in the last 6 months, \nconfirmed in Germany, of what is called germ cell pluripotent stem \ncells. They can make any type of cell, and it makes sense. What has \nbeen constant through the history of man that has survived? The ability \nto propagate and to repeat the species. And the unique thing about germ \ncell pluripotent stem cells is they come from both the testes and the \novaries of us, and we can capture from ourselves pluripotent stem cells \nthat do all the things and have all the potential that an embryonic \nstem cell might have.\n  The real question before us is, If there was a way for us to \nestablish this research and avoid any ethical questions, wouldn't we \nall want to go there? And what I am putting forward today is that way \nis here today. That way is here. The scientific community, in terms of \ntheir money-raising and fundraising and grant-seeking, hasn't caught up \nwith it. But mark my words: The real research in the pluripotent stem \ncells, those that can do anything and regenerate themselves and also \nhave the advantage of not creating teratomas or tumors, are going to be \nthe germ cell pluripotent stem cells. It is important for us to look at \nit.\n  Another quote: It won't involve cloned embryos. The only way a stem \ncell therapy from an embryonic stem cell can work for you is in one of \ntwo ways: you either clone yourself, and you will still have some \nproblems with rejection, or you will get from multiple, multiple lines \na close match.\n  I wanted to ask the leader yesterday--his biggest problem as a heart-\nlung transplant surgeon is the availability of organs, No. 1, and \nrejection, No. 2. The wonderful thing about adult stem cells is there \nis no rejection because you are giving yourself your own cells. The \nsame thing will be true of germ cell pluripotent stem cells. There will \nbe no rejection because you are giving identical DNA to yourself. All \nthe other treatments with embryonic stem cells will have rejection as a \ncomponent of their treatment. So is it a wonder that we want to \nresearch the miracles of life and look at this? No. It is great \nresearch that should be going forward.\n  But it is not true that there is not embryonic stem cell research \ngoing on in this country outside of the Government and around the \nworld. The question is, Are we going to use taxpayer money to do \nadditional research?\n\n  The other question that I raised is, Where is the money up to now \ngoing? The people who are investing outside of Government grants, where \nis the money going in terms of research? It is not going into embryonic \nstem cell research. It is going into every other type of research where \nthey can actually see treatments.\n\n[[Page S7668]]\n\n  Senator Hatch talked about heart disease. We now know that if you \nhave had an infarct and you get a bypass and you are injected with your \nown stem cells, a good portion of your scar goes away and the \ngeneration of new blood vessels around the heart is accelerated and \naccentuated to the degree of about 70 percent more than your body would \nnaturally do, if you are injected with your own stem cells at the time \nyou get your bypass. We are curing heart failure with adult stem cells \ntoday. We are curing new vessels in the heart.\n  There is recent research in the last 6 months where we are treating \nlung disease--pulmonary fibrosis. Charlie Norwood, a Congressman from \nGeorgia, has had pulmonary fibrosis and has had a lung transplant. In 5 \nyears, somebody with pulmonary fibrosis will be cured with their own \nstem cells--not with embryonic stem cells, with their own stem cells--\nand they won't have a problem with rejection. Yet Charlie has to take \ndrugs to keep from rejecting the lung transplant that he has.\n  Over time, we will recognize the value of what is really happening \ntoday in terms of treatments. We don't want the false promise. There is \nno question some great things will come out of embryonic stem cells. I \ndon't deny that. But if we could do it a different way, if we could do \nit in a way where we didn't approach the ethical question, almost \neverybody would agree, let's do that. What I am saying is that is \ncoming today.\n  Other quotes: Researchers have been prohibited from doing research on \nembryos. That is not true. That is not true. There is research ongoing \ntoday, with $41 million of your money last year on embryos. We haven't \nprohibited the research. We have said it is going to be limited. This \nbill, H.R. 810, says: There is no limit. Whether you agree with it or \nnot, your money is going to be used to go in this direction.\n  I have not approached the ethical issues on pro-life--I am pro-life, \nbut I am not claiming that as a defense on this issue. I am claiming \nthat the smart science will avoid it and look at where the benefits \nare. There is no question.\n  I wish to quote from Lord Winston, the most prominent fetal embryonic \nstem cell researcher in England: ``I view the current wave of optimism \nabout embryonic stem cells with growing suspicion.''\n  He says we have overpromised. He is right. It is going to be decades \nbefore a response comes from embryonic stem cells. There is not one \nviable treatment with embryonic stem cells in an animal model today, \nlet alone a human model. There are hundreds in animal models and there \nare 72 in humans. To me, this is an easy question which doesn't have \nanything to do with ethics. Put the money where the results are. The \nresults are here. I will promise you, germ cell pluripotent stem cells \nwill be the end-all for our ethical question. It is just a shame that \nthe politics isn't up with the science.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the majority still \nhas 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the minority is in control of the next 30 \nminutes.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nWisconsin, Mr. Kohl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 810, the Stem Cell Research \nEnhancement Act of 2005, which is a bill that will expand the number of \nstem cell lines that are eligible for federally funded research \nensuring that scientists at NIH and laboratories around the country \nhave access to new, uncontaminated stem cell lines. America's best \nscientific minds have told us that harnessing the power of these cells \ncould one day lead to a cure for a number of diseases that afflict \nfamilies all across our country.\n  Nearly every family in America has experienced the tragedy of \nwatching a loved one suffer through a deadly or debilitating illness. \nDiseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's take a terrible toll on \nfamilies' lives and livelihoods. While we have made great strides in \nbiomedical research in recent years, we still do not have all the keys \nto unlock the secrets of disease.\n  Today the Senate has the opportunity to reach across partisan lines \nand touch the millions of individuals and families who suffer the \nravages of diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. We are not \nresearchers, but today we can give our best researchers the material \nthey need to understand these diseases. We are not doctors, but today \nwe can give our best doctors the weapons to fight back for their dying \npatients. And we are not patients--at least not yet--but today we can \ngive patients hope for not just relief but a cure.\n  The University of Wisconsin at Madison was the first to isolate the \nhuman embryonic stem cells that have the ability to develop into \nvirtually any cell type in the human body. They have stated \nunequivocally that they need H.R. 810 in order to continue their \ngroundbreaking work. Without H.R. 810, they fear America will fall \nbehind the rest of the world in medical and biotechnical research.\n  We all understand that this research is not without controversy. I \nrespect the concerns that some have about the use of embryonic stem \ncells. We must closely monitor this research to ensure that it is done \nethically, and our passage today of S. 3504 and S. 2754 demonstrates \nthe unanimous bipartisan commitment to do just that.\n  We must step carefully, but we also must step forward, and that is \nwhat H.R. 810 is all about, opening new cell lines so we can move \nforward toward new understanding, new hope, and new cures.\n  Last year, the House took that step forward decisively and in a \nbipartisan manner, and so this year it is our turn. It would be \nunconscionable for our Government to turn its back to the discoveries \nthat expanding stem cell research promises. Now more than ever it is \nimportant to grasp this opportunity in an ethical manner by making sure \nthat potentially lifesaving research does not slow or stall.\n  We may not be in the laboratories where scientists are working around \nthe clock to develop new vaccines, treatments, and cures. We may not be \nin the hospitals diagnosing and caring for the sick and the infirm. But \ntoday the Senate will openly decide to stand with the scientists, \ndoctors, and patients. I urge my colleagues to look past the politics \nof this debate and embrace a promise of progress.\n  With that I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nArkansas, Mrs. Lincoln.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  I, too, Mr. President, come to the floor today with tremendous \nrespect for the sensitivity of this very critical issue that we in the \nSenate and in the Congress have worked so diligently to ensure--that we \nnot only respect the sensitive nature but that we also look toward the \npossibilities of what we can do for the constituents we represent.\n  I am very pleased that the Senate is debating stem cell research, and \nparticularly H.R. 810, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, and I \nthank the majority leader, Senator Frist, for scheduling a vote on this \nvery important bill today.\n  I am a proud cosponsor of the Senate companion bill, S. 471, because \nit offers new hope for patients, for grandmothers and grandfathers, \nchildren, daughters, mothers, fathers, and for their families who love \nthem so dearly.\n  Four years ago I watched my mother give her utmost of devotion to the \nman she had loved--and still loves--and shared her life with for more \nthan 52 years. She had pledged to care for him and to honor his life \nuntil he departed this world, even if he no longer remembered her name \nor could recognize her face. My sweet father suffered from Alzheimer's \ndisease. My sisters and my brother had been by his side helplessly for \nyears watching as, first, he lost the\n\n[[Page S7669]]\n\nmost precious of all things, his memory, his ability to see his family \nand to remember the cherished moments that we had spent as family, and \nthen, unfortunately, also, the dignity of life, in his ability to care \nfor himself. My mother's commitment to my father during his long \nillness remains a tremendous source of inspiration to me and to the \nrest of our family.\n  Unfortunately, my family's experience with the ravages of Alzheimer's \nis not unique. Millions of victims and their families are suffering \nfrom debilitating diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, \ndiabetes, heart disease, multiple sclerosis, burns, and spinal cord \ninjuries. Fortunately, we have within our power the potential to \nrelieve their suffering and the possibility of cure.\n  I believe embryonic stem cell research conducted ethically and under \nGovernment supervision holds the potential to offer lifesaving \ntreatments for many diseases that have frustrated the medical community \nfor ages. I also believe that whenever we have the power to heal the \nsick we have the responsibility to do so. It is a commandment as old as \nthe Scriptures themselves.\n  In 2001, President Bush made the decision to use Federal dollars to \nfund embryonic stem cell research. By allowing embryonic stem cell \nresearch to move forward, the President signaled that he believed this \nwas both a morally acceptable and potentially lifesaving form of \nresearch. Since the President's decision, we have discovered that in \norder for embryonic stem cell research to reach its fullest potential \nand for science to be accurate, it is essential to expand the number of \nstem cell lines that are eligible for federally funded research. H.R. \n810 will allow Federal funding for research on an expanded number of \nembryonic stem cell lines according to strict ethical requirements. The \nbill would restrict Federal funding to only those stem cells from \nembryos that would otherwise be discarded. In addition, the bill \nrequires that any individuals wanting to donate embryos do so with \nwritten consent and not receive any financial inducement.\n  Also, the bill does nothing to change the current law banning the use \nof Federal money to destroy human embryos. H.R. 810 gives us the \nopportunity to expand lifesaving research with proper ethical \nsafeguards. Furthermore, it will be a step forward in helping us to \nfulfill our moral obligation to heal the sick. And in the end, that \nobligation is one that we must keep.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield my time back to Senator Harkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 20 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Delaware, Mr. \nCarper.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank my colleague for yielding. I am moved by the \ncomments of Senator Lincoln, and I suspect we could go throughout the \nSenate Chamber from desk to desk, from Member to Member, and each of us \ncould tell a personal story from our own family as moving as I found \nher description of the life of her father.\n  In my own family, my grandfather, a wonderful role model as a butcher \nfrom West Virginia, had Parkinson's disease. He got up every morning \nand drove through the mountain roads to the butcher shop to cut meat. \nEvery day I would watch him leave the House, his hands shaking, fingers \nshaking, wondering if he was going to chop one off, and he never did in \nall the years that he ran that butcher shop.\n  I think of the time, looking at Senator Harkin and myself and some \nothers in the Chamber who served in the House, we served with Mo Udall. \nI remember riding back and forth on the subway between the House \nbuildings, the Rayburn Building, riding over to the Senate Chamber with \nMo Udall and watching his body slowly deteriorate. I think of Ford \nKing, my brother in law, now deceased, who was controlled by ALS over a \ndecade or so ago and watching his life slowly fade away as ALS took its \ntoll on him. I think of Alzheimer's and my own mom who passed away last \nyear, her mom who was a victim of Alzheimer's, and the millions of \nothers who die from that disease in our country.\n  I think of my own healthy sons, thank God, 16 and 18 years of age, \nand I think of their friends having to prick their bodies or their \nfingers several times a day, as much as 10 times a day, to take insulin \nshots and know that is the way they are going to have to live for the \nrest of their life.\n  Today is a day of tremendous opportunity. It is an opportunity to \npush for the kind of medical research that will make a difference in \nthe lives of the people--not the people I just mentioned, \nunfortunately, for the most part, but in the lives of their children \nand their grandchildren. It is an opportunity to help find treatment \nfor diseases such as the ones I mentioned, Parkinson's disease and \njuvenile diabetes and autoimmune disorders and heart disease and even, \nif we are lucky, cancer.\n\n  We know that stem cells hold great promise. Already stem cells have \nbeen used to help paralyzed rats regain the ability to move. Stem cells \nhave been converted into motor neurons which could help treat spinal \ncord injuries or Lou Gehrig's disease--ALS.\n  Stem cells have also been coaxed into becoming brain cells to one day \nhelp patients with Parkinson's disease, such as my own grandfather, \nsuch as our old colleague, Mo Udall.\n  Today, though, is about more than just curing diseases. It is also \nabout keeping America's research centers competitive and relevant. Stem \ncell research is likely to be an important area of science and medicine \nfor a long time to come. Instead of treading water, as we have done \nunder President Bush's stem cell policy, America should be leading the \nway and making other countries play catchup, instead of us playing \ncatchup to them.\n  We have done this in the past. The United States has always been a \nvaluable contributor to the prevention and treatment of illness. We \nhave developed vaccines and antibiotics that have saved literally \nmillions of lives. We have made tremendous advances in the areas of \nbiotechnology and pharmaceutical research.\n  Now we have an opportunity to make a national commitment to expand \nthe frontiers of medical research once again.\n  If we focus our resources and attention today to find cures, we will \nsave lives, and we will save money in the long run.\n  H.R. 810, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act which is before us \ntoday, was introduced in the House of Representatives by my own \nCongressman, Mike Castle. Here in the Senate, it has been shepherded by \ntwo of our finest colleagues, Senator Specter and Tom Harkin of Iowa. \nThis bill would greatly expand our ability to take the next steps in \nstem cell research by expanding the number of stem lines eligible for \nFederal funding. It would also strengthen the ethical rules that govern \nstem cell research.\n  Under the administration's current policy, the number of stem cell \nlines available for federally funded research has continued to shrink. \nThere are now, I am told, only 22 lines available. What is more, many \nof those current lines are contaminated or have reached the end of \ntheir useful life.\n  The Castle bill would allow new lines to be derived from excess in \nvitro fertilization embryos that would otherwise be thrown away. The \nchoice seems clear, at least to me and I know to a lot of people in my \nState. Rather than allow these embryos to be discarded and thrown away, \nwith the consent of the couple who want to donate those embryos, with \ntheir permission, we can use those embryos to further lifesaving \nresearch.\n  These new stem cell lines will dramatically expand our ability to \nstudy and find treatments for a wide range of illnesses. The benefits \nwill come not only from having more stem cell lines but from having \nbetter lines. By expanding our research policy, we can create stem cell \nlines that help us study specific diseases or create specific \ntreatments.\n  I urge all our colleagues to support H.R. 810. I know there are a \ncouple on the brink, who are undecided. They know who they are. I \nencourage them to listen to the folks from their own\n\n[[Page S7670]]\n\nStates and their own families whose lives could have been enhanced, \nbeen lengthened--or in the future will be. Let's vote today to expand \nstem cell research so we, our children, our grandchildren, and a whole \nlot of people beyond them can benefit in the future.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of our time to the \nSenator from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to begin by thanking the Senator \nfrom Iowa, Senator Harkin, for his long leadership on this and other \nissues of importance to research and to people with disabilities.\n  For each of us, and for millions of Americans, this is a very \npersonal issue. It is impossible to separate it from our own \nexperiences. I have heard colleagues on the floor talking about \ngrandparents and other members of their family and the experiences they \nhave had. I will never forget, personally, almost 2 years ago standing \nin an amphitheater in Denver, talking to many people--many of them in \nwheelchairs, many who had lost loved ones to disease, many who knew a \ncure would never come in time for them--who held out hope, \nnevertheless, that stem cell research might save a loved one, might \nsave someone else in similar circumstances.\n  What they wanted, above all, was leadership. They wanted someone back \nin Washington to fight for them. I promised them that I would do all \nthat I could, and I will never forget the look of yearning and hope in \ntheir eyes, the pleading, if you will, that people would come to a \nplace of common sense. They placed enormous hope in all of us in the \nCongress.\n  When I think about them and I think about people all over the country \nwho are so personally invested in this issue, I am deeply troubled to \nsee that today we find ourselves in a place of division, where we could \nhave been united. We are divided principally by the promise of \nPresident Bush to veto a bipartisan bill that funds stem cell research.\n  In more than 5 years, President Bush has not vetoed a single bill--\nnot one. He signed 1,129 bills into law, without raising his pen to \nveto one--not a bill that overspent, not a bill that moved in any other \ndirection that he disagreed with. Now he wants to use the first veto of \nhis Presidency to stomp on the hopes of millions of Americans suffering \nfrom devastating illnesses.\n  A veto now would send a profound message to all Americans that, on \ncrucial issues, our differences are greater than our shared \nconvictions. It would also tell the world that America no longer wants \nto be the country that leads the world in scientific knowledge and \ndiscovery.\n  The bipartisan legislation before Congress shows that Congress has \nfound a way to take the politics out of the debate on stem cell \nresearch. It is time that the White House does the same.\n  Our current policy is eroding America's national advantage on stem \ncell research. We are tying our scientists' hands. We are holding back \nour doctors. We need a policy that is not driven by a narrow view but, \nrather a broader, consensus-driven approach to life and to science \nitself. We need a Federal policy that builds on the advances being made \nin our States, in our universities, in our private foundations, and \nresearch centers. I believe that Senate passage of H.R. 810, with \nvetoproof majorities, can put us on that path.\n  What a tragedy it would be if the first veto of the Bush Presidency \nwere used as a political wedge. This is something that Washington and \nthe rest of America overwhelmingly supports, regardless of political \nparty. It is a promise that offers hope to millions and could put \nAmerica on the path to leading the world in the discovery of cures. \nThis is not a wedge issue. This is about common sense and about \npeople's lives.\n  For all of us, the issue of stem cell research is personal, as I \nmentioned. Yes, it does raise profound moral questions and nobody \nshould skip by those questions. I am not seeking to. But I do believe \nthat any legitimate examination of conscience and any legitimate \nexamination of the moral questions about life that are at stake can be \nresolved in a way that respects life and that properly puts morality on \nthe side of the decision we are making.\n  When it comes to stem cell research--and all scientific research--we \nought to demand no less than that kind of effort. I acknowledge, yes, \nthere are those moral and ethical issues. But I believe the legislation \nthat was passed by the House of Representatives with bipartisan support \ndoes provide strong ethical guidelines, strong ethical safeguards, and \nit limits what this research would do in a way that does respect those \nmoral questions that are at issue.\n  First of all, federally funded research with respect to embryos would \nonly go to, or be limited to, those that are donated by in vitro \nfertilization clinics, so you don't create some new business or create \nsome disrespectful effort that is outside the effort of reproduction \nand of life itself.\n  Second, they would only be permissible when created specifically for \nfertility treatment--which is going to occur anyway, which does occur \nanyway--and which is in keeping with our efforts to respect life.\n\n  In addition, we live in a situation today where those embryos that \nare created in the context of in vitro fertilization are either going \nto be used for the purpose of creating life or those numbers that are \nin excess are going to be discarded. That is the fact. That is what is \ngoing to happen. So this legislation limits the use of those embryos \nonly that are donated by treatment-seeking individuals who provided \nwritten and informed consent and who were not offered financial \ninducements in order to do so.\n  As the Los Angeles Times editorialized 2 years ago:\n\n       The moral decision is between putting those few so-called \n     embryos in the trash or using them to possibly bring back \n     lost memory, keep people out of wheelchairs or free them from \n     the life of insulin injections. It is not a simple decision, \n     but it is also not a close call.\n\n  Growing numbers of conservatives, from John McCain, Bill Frist, and \nOrrin Hatch to Nancy Reagan, have looked carefully at the scientific \nfacts and searched their own consciences and arrived at the same \nconclusion: Opposing stem cell research, with the restrictions and the \nappropriate ethical guidelines that have been put in place, is the \nopposite of a pro-life policy. In the Senate and across the country, \nAmericans are approaching an ethical consensus that bans human cloning \nwhile protecting stem cell research.\n  The stakes could not be higher. More than 100 million Americans \nsuffer from illnesses that one day might be cured with stem cell \ntherapy. Stem cells could replace damaged heart cells or cells \ndestroyed by cancer. They could offer a new lease on life to those with \na diagnosis that once came as a death sentence. Research has the \npotential to slow the loss of a grandmother's memory, calm the hand of \nan uncle with Parkinson's, save a child from a lifetime of daily \ninsulin shots or permanently lift a best friend or a colleague from a \nwheelchair.\n  There is a young woman on the floor of the Senate who shares this \nhope. Her name is Beth Kolbe. She is a summer intern in my office, and \nshe has followed the stem cell research debate very closely over the \nyears and especially this week. Beth has spent the last 2 days watching \nthe debate on the Senate floor, and her presence now is a silent, \npowerful reminder of what is at stake.\n  At the age of 14, Beth was in a car accident and suffered a terrible \nspinal cord injury. In that instant, she was paralyzed from the chest \ndown. After two neck surgeries, 2 weeks in intensive care, 2 months as \nan inpatient in a rehab hospital and 2 years as an outpatient in \nphysical therapy, she is now living a very full life. She just told me \nthat she is in the Paralympics as a swimmer, and she lives her life and \nloves her life as a junior at Harvard, studying biology and health \ncare, navigating the campus in her wheelchair. But she told me also \nthat it would be a lie to say that there are not challenges that she \nwould like to have overcome.\n  She wants more, not just for her but for others. Here is what she \nsaid:\n\n       Since that day 6 years ago, my family and I have been \n     following stem cell research because it can help so many \n     people. I'm just one of the millions who can be helped. As a \n     person in the disability community, I've met so many people \n     whose main goal is just to get better, and stem cell research \n     is their one opportunity to find a cure. I hope to be\n\n[[Page S7671]]\n\n     a face that the Senators can see, so that they can see what \n     they are voting for.\n\n  Beth is here because she wants to see the Senate vote for hope. Some \nof the most pioneering treatments and miraculous cures could be at our \nfingertips, right around the next corner, but because of politics they \ncould remain beyond reach. Every day we wait, more than 3,000 Americans \ndie from diseases that might someday be treatable because of the \ndiscoveries made through stem cell research.\n  Americans have been presented with a false choice between the \nsanctity of human life and the scientific knowledge that can save it.\n  The President's veto rests on the false assumption that we have to \nchoose between our dreams and our principles. I believe we can have \nboth and we can protect both.\n  We can support our scientists, help the sick, and ensure that our \nlegal and ethical boundaries continue to reflect our unshakable sense \nof human dignity and the value of human life.\n  If we get votes from 72 out of 100 Senators--then we can send the \nPresident a vetoproof message. Stop tying our scientists' hands, put \ndown your veto pen, stop being part of the problem and become a part of \nthe solution.\n  The American people believe in stem cell research for many of the \nsame reasons as a remarkable woman I met at a town hall meeting on stem \ncell research.\n  She stood up in the back of the room. I will never forget it. Her \nbody was shaking. She was petrified, but her body was also shaking \nbecause of the disease she had. She pleaded, with tears, for her \ngovernment to embrace stem cell research.\n  It was the moral clarity of her message that will stay with me \nforever. Many Americans know a woman like her--maybe it's a grandparent \nwith Alzheimer's or a friend in a wheelchair. ``It's too late for me,'' \nshe said, ``but we need to do this for those who still have hope.''\n  It's too late for my and Tom Harkin's friend, Christopher Reeve, who \npassed away in 2004. But it's not too late for this President to change \nhis mind before tying the hands of doctors, scientists, and ethicists \nwith a preemptive veto. Chris would agree that it's not too late to \ngive millions of Americans what they want most of all, which is hope.\n  And in closing, I want to share one more story. It's from Lauren \nStanford of Plymouth, MA. She is 14 years old and has suffered from \njuvenile diabetes for 9 years. She and her mother, Moira McCarthy, came \ndown to Washington, DC each year as citizen lobbyists in support of \nstem cell research and finding a cure for diabetes.\n  I want to read you a few passages from an essay she wrote as follows:\n\n       For as long as I can remember, I've had to take a lot of \n     leaps if faith. I've had to believe my parents when they told \n     me taking four or five shots a day and pricking my finger \n     eight or more times a day was just ``a new kind of normal.''\n       I've had to smile at the world and say I really don't mind \n     wearing the insulin pump that's now connected to my body 24 \n     hours a day, seven days a week.\n       Yes, in my nine years of life with Type 1 diabetes, I've \n     learned to accept a lot of it is and the way it things as \n     ``just the way it is and the way it has to be.''\n       But when I watched, with my parents, President Bush's \n     decision on Stem Cell research in the summer of 2001--and his \n     vows now to veto the bill--I just could not accept it.\n       You see the one thing that has helped me accept all I've \n     had to accept these years is the presence of hope.\n       When I feel like I might just scream if I have to live \n     another day fighting this endless disease, I think about all \n     the researchers out there working to help me be cured. Now, \n     it might seem corny to think of a teenage girl dreaming about \n     researchers in labs, but that's what kids who have incurable \n     diseases do.\n       Stem cell research could mean I can go to college without a \n     machine attached to my belly keeping me alive. It could mean \n     I can have children just like anyone else; not with teams of \n     doctors working with me daily just to make it happen. . . . \n     It might mean my children won't even know what diabetes was.\n       President Bush talks about protecting the innocent. I \n     wonder, what about me? I am truly innocent in this situation. \n     I did nothing to bring my diabetes on. . . . How, I ask my \n     parents, is it more important to throw discarded embryos into \n     the trash than it is to let them be used to hopefully save my \n     life--and to give me back a life where I don't have to accept \n     a constant, almost insane level of hourly medical \n     intervention as ``normal?'' How could my nation do this to \n     me?\n\n  Her hopes are here today, and I hope the Senate will do the right \nthing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the majority is \nrecognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH. Thank you, Mr. President. I am very grateful the Senate is \nconsidering the issue of stem cell research today. This debate marks \nthe culmination of years of work by many of my colleagues and certainly \nby myself, and a host of dedicated advocates.\n  I thank Senators Specter and Harkin for their leadership on this \nissue, as well as Senators Hatch, Feinstein, and Kennedy. The work the \nsix of us have done since the House considered embryonic stem cell \nresearch last May has helped keep the issue alive in the Senate.\n  I also would also like to recognize Senator Frist, who helped \nnegotiate the package of bills before us. His willingness to take up \nthis important, yet divisive issue is very much appreciated.\n  While all three bills are important to the advancement of ethical \nstem cell research, there is one that stands apart from the others. \nThat is H.R. 810, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act Simply, this \nbill would allow federal dollars to support research on stem cells \nderived from human embryos.\n  The tension surrounding this issue, I believe, pits the benefits that \nall can see and the potential that may be derived against the ethical \nuncertainties or the religious convictions our colleagues have. I think \nit is very important to respect both perspectives--and I certainly do. \nBut I believe their reservations are misplaced when a full \nunderstanding is made of this very important area of research.\n  I think it is also important to point out as a show of respect for \nthe differences of opinion that everyone in the Senate supports the \nbill's intent of furthering medical research--research that could \npossibly lead to a cure for a number of chronic diseases and \ndebilitating health conditions.\n  The promise of embryonic stem cell research is very real. But I think \nwe must emphasis and admit it is but a promise. It has yet to be fully \nrealized because of the current restrictions which we have placed on \nit. While I appreciate the President allowing research to move forward \non existing stem cell lines, over time these lines have become degraded \nand we are in desperate need of new, uncontaminated lines.\n  Stem cell science has the potential to cure dreadful illnesses such \nas Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and many \ncancers. But we can't expect scientists to make progress in developing \ntreatments if we limit them to yesterday's science.\n  I believe the Federal Government has a vital but a moral role to play \nin the development of stem cell science to ensure that the appropriate \nethical guidelines are followed. To leave this to the private sector, \nwith insufficient funding and no moral boundaries--we don't know where \nwe will windup. But I do know the Federal Government can guide it in \nthe right direction. I believe we will run into very serious problems \nif we do not as a Federal Government show up to work on this issue.\n  The real issue that is troubling to so many of us in this Chamber is \nquestions of morality. I am pro life and throughout my political career \nI have supported policies that respect the sanctity of all human \nbeings. I realize that many pro-life advocates oppose embryonic stem \ncell research on the ground that it destroys a human life. But as I \nhave consulted with scientists and reflected upon my own conscience, I \nhave come to a different conclusion. I feel that embryonic stem cell \nresearch is a pro-life policy. The key question that looms over this \ndebate is, When does life begin? For me it begins with mother, with the \nimplantation of an embryo. I believe the Scriptures provide ample \nsupport showing that flesh and spirit become one with the mother. This \nis one of womankind's supernal gifts. I find these verses in the Old \nand the New Testaments--in Jeremiah, the Psalmist, Job, Matthew, Mark, \nLuke, John, and in the letters of Paul. All of these things lead me to \nfeel comfortable with an ethical conclusion that life begins when flesh \nand spirit are united and not before.\n  The embryos created as part of the in vitro fertilization process \nwere intended to provide infertile couples the\n\n[[Page S7672]]\n\ngift of life. Those embryos that go unused in fertility treatments \nshould still have the opportunity to give the gift of life either by \nlater implantation or to those living with debilitating diseases \nthrough this dramatic medical research.\n  Without being implanted in a mother's womb, an IVF embryo is a group \nof cells growing in a petri dish. But if those cells are left there for \nthousands of years, they have no possibility of developing into \nanything. They remain a group of cells, the dust of the Earth, one of \nthe building blocks leading to life. It is the act of implantation \nwithin the mother that gives them life. So instead of storing or \ndiscarding unused embryos, we have the opportunity to allow them to be \nused to derive stem cell lines to advance much needed medical research.\n  I believe it would be a tremendous loss to science and to all \nhumanity if we choose to hold back the key to unlocking the mysteries \nthat have long puzzled scientists and physicians. That is why it is so \nimportant that my colleagues cast a vote in favor of H.R. 810, a very \npro-life vote.\n  Some of the bill's opponents may claim that you can equally support \nstem cell research by voting for Senator Santorum's bill which \nauthorizes a number of research alternatives. I support Senator \nSantorum's bill and plan to vote for it today, but it is by no means a \nsubstitute for H.R. 810.\n  Alternative forms of stem cell research are in their very early \nstages--just like embryonic stem cell research. Considering the \nenormous medical benefits that may come from these emerging fields of \nscience, we cannot afford to promote some methods while restricting \nothers.\n  After years of reflecting on this issue, it has become increasingly \nclear to me that being pro life requires protecting both the sanctity \nand the quality of life. By allowing research on stem cell lines \nderived from unused IVF embryos, we could forge a path that would one \nday lead to cures of some of mankind's most dreadful medical maladies.\n  If only one life-improving application of stem cell science comes \nfrom this vote--from my vote--then I believe I have done my job and \ndone it correctly, for on this issue I choose to err on the side of \nhope, healing, and health.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues--even those who have some ethical \nreservations or religious feelings on this issue--to do the same.\n  I heard on the radio last night a radio commentator describing \nembryonic stem cell research as a conflict between science and \nreligion. I do not believe that religion and science are in conflict on \nthis issue. I believe one of the great gifts of the United States--the \nbest example of the United States to the world--is our pluralism, \nreligious pluralism. It is something we see an absence of, tragically, \nin too many places of the world. You see blood running in the gutters \nof the Middle East as we speak because of sectarian views which are \nheld to the point of murdering those with divergent views. Therefore, I \ndo not believe we serve the public well by taking the narrowest \ntheological position and trying to impose it on public policy. We \nshould be open enough to include other considerations of ethical ideas, \nscriptural interpretations, and scientific hope.\n  For me, as I consider issues of life and death, I often turn to the \nGood Book to try to discern wisdom that I do not have myself. What I \nfind in the earliest pages of the Torah--or the Old Testament--is this \nstatement. And I quote:\n\n       The Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground and \n     breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became \n     a living soul.\n\n  I am not a scientist, and I am not a theologian. But as I use my \nagency to interpret this early description of the sanctity of mankind's \nlife, what I read is that we are made of dust. We ourselves are \ndust. Unto dust we will return.\n\n  Then you come to the conjunction in this verse, the conjunction \n``and.'' ``And breathed with his nostrils the breath of life.'' Then \nyou come to another conjunction, ``and man became a living soul.''\n  I believe that pluripotent stem cells are one of the building blocks \nof life. Clearly they are. Even if you leave them in a petri dish for \nan eternity, they will remain cells, the dust of the Earth. I believe \nwe are missing the understanding of the importance of the spirit, the \nbreath of life--the spirit of mankind--as the essential ingredient as \nto when life begins.\n  I do not find that religion and science are in conflict in the Senate \ntoday. I believe they are in harmony. I believe we should have a broad \nenough view to include the many views that comprise American pluralism.\n  I urge President Bush not to veto H.R. 810. I believe it offers hope. \nIt offers promise. We can't overpromise. But it opens the key to the \nfuture, to unlocking mysteries of science, to improve the quality of \nlife now. What could be more pro life than that?\n  Finally, my position is formed by my family history. My mother's name \nwas Jessica Udall. I watched my grandmother, Lela Lee Udall, die of \nParkinson's. I watched my uncle, Addison Udall, die of Parkinson's. I \nwatched my cousin, former Democratic Presidential candidate and Arizona \nCongressman Morris K. Udall, die of Parkinson's. To watch people die of \nsuch a malady is to instill in one's heart a desire to err on the side \nof health, hope, and healing, to find the cure if a cure can be found. \nWe will all die but no one should have to die as they died.\n  I appeal to my friend President Bush in the memory of my Udall \nancestry, please, do not veto this bill. Do not deny them, people such \nas the Udalls, the hope that can come from this research. I believe \nthis is an important debate. If this bill is vetoed, another election \nwill occur, another chapter of American democracy will be opened, and \nultimately the will of the American people will be reflected in our \npolicy. I believe the sooner, the better. So, to my pro-life friend, \nPresident Bush, I urge in the name of life to let this bill become law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the majority still \ncontrols 1 minute 45 seconds.\n  Mr. SMITH. I yield back the remainder of that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the minority is \nrecognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will soon yield 7 minutes each to Senators Feingold and \nSchumer, in that order.\n  First, I had a meeting I was supposed to go to at noon. I am sorry I \nmissed the meeting; people are waiting for me. I am not sorry that I \nwas here to hear the profound statement made by my friend Senator \nSmith. It was one of the more touching, more profound, and more \ninsightful statements made during these 2 days of debate. I thank the \nSenator for that.\n  I yield 7 minutes to Senator Feingold, and at the end of 7 minutes, \nto the Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized for 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as we debate this important legislation \nregarding stem cell research, we are reminded of the millions of \npatients and families across America who await treatment and cures for \nour most deadly and tragic diseases. As of Friday afternoon, over \n92,000 Americans were on waiting lists for organ transplant. Seventeen \nof these people will die every day waiting for a vital organ. \nScientists believe that over half of Americans over 85 may suffer from \nAlzheimer's disease, and at least half a million Americans currently \nhave Parkinson's disease. As we all know, these kinds of serious \ndiagnoses affect not only the patient, but that patient's family, \nfriends, and community. Illness is a burden we all share.\n  Fortunately, over the past century, science has turned many of our \nworst medical fears into manageable chronic conditions, sometimes into \nmere nuisances, and, in some instances, has erased them entirely.\n  Today we stand at the threshold of a new era of scientific \nachievement. Stem cell research has vast potential for curing diseases \nand saving lives. We must recognize the enormous potential of this \nresearch for discovering new cures and therapies for disease such as \ndiabetes, Parkinson's disease, and spinal cord injuries. Millions of \npatients and their families across the Nation\n\n[[Page S7673]]\n\ncannot afford to wait any longer for enactment of this urgently needed \nlegislation.\n  I am a strong supporter and proud cosponsor of the Stem Cell Research \nEnhancement Act. I have heard from many of my constituents in Wisconsin \nin support of this legislation, and I am glad that the Senate is \naddressing this today and responding to the requests of millions across \nthe country. As the Senator from Oregon eloquently said a few minutes \nago, for many people this is a deeply personal issue. When an \nindividual or loved one suffers from an incurable disease or medical \ncondition, it can be devastating. Everyone knows someone who has \nsuffered from diabetes, Alzheimer's Parkinson's, or another \ndebilitating disease, and we all know the physical and emotional pain \ninflicted as a result. It is vitally important that we move this \nlegislation into law as expeditiously as possible and provide the \nresources that scientists need to develop treatments and cures for \nthese diseases.\n  Researchers can unlock enormous potential in stem cell research if \nCongress will only give them the key. At the University of Wisconsin in \n1998, Dr. James Thomson became the first scientist to break into this \nnew frontier by isolating human embryonic stem cells. Since then, \nresearchers at the university have been able to coax embryonic stem \ncells to develop into mature blood cells, which could provide \ntreatments and cures for people with a range of currently incurable \ndiseases. By further examining the potential of stem cells, scientists \nat the University of Wisconsin have also successfully developed neural \ncells, and they have even transferred these cells successfully into \nmice, where the cells continued to thrive. The possibilities here are \nclear: If technology such as this is able to expand, those with \nneurological disorders and bleak prognoses may now have hope.\n  Despite its incredible promise, this research has unfortunately been \nlimited by the President since 2001. It is time for Congress to take \nthe necessary action to provide more stem cell lines to scientists so \nthat this research can go forward, without the Federal Government \nstanding in the way.\n  The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act would allow federally funded \nresearch to be conducted on stem cell lines derived from excess embryos \ncreated for in vitro fertilization, IVF, that are no longer needed and \nare donated by couples for research. It is estimated that there are \nmore than 400,000 embryos that were created for fertility treatments \nand are likely to be destroyed.\n  There is much work that needs to be done to further understand the \nrole that embryonic stem cells can play in providing answers to some of \nthe most troubling medical diseases and conditions that affect so many \nAmericans. The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act will help our \nNation's researchers get closer to unlocking what this research holds \nby increasing the quantity and quality of stem cell lines available for \nresearch.\n  Embryonic stem cell research is very important to me and to \nWisconsin. I am proud that the University of Wisconsin has played a \nprominent role in stem cell research in this country. I know that my \nconstituents, and Americans across the country, are eagerly awaiting \nthe benefits that this research will provide.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this incredibly \nimportant science which would expand our research horizons and bring \nhope to so many people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized for 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 810, the \nStem Cell Research Enhancement Act. Any one of us who has met people \nwho have petitioned us for this act has to be moved. I have looked into \nthe eyes of a mother who brought her beautiful 4-year-old daughter to \nmy office and said, Senator, please allow this research to go forward \nbecause I am worried my daughter will be blind at the age of 20 without \nit.\n  I have met families whose patriarch is suffering from ALS, Lou \nGehrig's disease. Again, they have pleaded with us, allow the research \nto go forward so maybe that person or his children, who might get the \ndisease, will be able to be cured.\n  I have met with so many people my age whose parents are suffering \nfrom Alzheimer's or Parkinson's. Again, they plead with us, allow stem \ncell research to move forward so that maybe my parent or other parents \nsuch as mine could be cured.\n  Americans struggle with diseases every day. The confounding and \namazing thing is, when scientists are on the edge of a breakthrough, \nthe President stops them. Scientists are on the cusp of making \nincredible progress through stem cell research, a process that has the \npotential to cure diseases as widespread as diabetes and heart disease, \nbut progress came to a grinding halt in 2001 when President Bush \nlimited federally funded stem cell research to only 19 sources. With \nthat Executive Order, President Bush shut the door on hope for millions \nof American families. With that one action, the President not only \nstopped current research in its tracks, he sent a message to future \nscientists that they should not pursue this line of work. As they see a \nlimited funding stream for the work they do, fewer and fewer graduates \nare specializing in this kind of work. We need the best minds there.\n  Substantively, there is no doubt this is the right thing to do. But I \nput it in a broader context. There is a group of people in America of \ndeep faith. I respect that faith. I have been in enough inner-city \nBlack churches, working-class Catholic parishes, rural Methodist houses \nof worship, and small Jewish synagogues, to understand that faith is a \ngift. The trouble with this group, which I call the theocrats, is they \nwant that faith to dictate what our Government does. That, in a word, \nis un-American. It is exactly the reason the Founding Fathers put down \ntheir plows and took up muskets to fight.\n  If you do not like stem cell research, don't use it for yourself or \nyour family, but don't tell millions of Americans who may not share \nyour faith that they cannot use it, as well.\n  We have seen this repeatedly with Schiavo, or the required teaching \nof creationism in the schools, and now with stem cell research. \nUnfortunately, the President and too many in this Chamber and too many \nin the other Chamber have gone along and said that faith, wonderful and \nnoble as it is, should determine what our Government does.\n  This administration is not pursuing what most Americans want, but \nfollowing the dictates of the narrow few. Fortunately, we live in a \ndemocracy. In a democracy these issues are debated.\n  I assure everyone in this Chamber, this issue will be debated and \ndebated strongly in November. Those who have stood in the way of \nscientific progress and research, those who have told that wonderful \nmother that her child cannot get the research she needs so she might \nnot be blind, will be held accountable. This will be one of the largest \nissues that will face us in November, and it should. That is what \ndemocracy is all about. All of those, including the President, who have \ntried to hide their actions with false promises or bills that \naccomplish nothing, will be held accountable.\n  Thank God we have a democracy. Thank God that a narrow band of \npeople, few in number, deep in conviction, cannot dictate what our \nGovernment does. The fact that H.R. 810 has come to the Senate, the \nfact that it will get a large majority of votes here as it did in the \nHouse, and the fact that the President and some of his allies in this \nChamber and others have stood in the way of saving lives and of \nscientific progress because they believe their faith should dictate \nwhat the rest of us do--again, they will be held accountable for that.\n  I hope this measure passes. It would be a miracle, a miracle that \ncould save lives if it got a veto-proof majority in this Senate. I \ndoubt that will happen. But one can always hope, because the hopes, the \nfutures, of millions of Americans, born and unborn, rest on us pursuing \nthis research, doing what science tells us it needs to do to enhance \nand preserve life, and not be blocked by a small group that wishes to \nimpose its views on everyone else.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/18/senate-section/article/S7673-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7673-S7674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The majority controls the next 30 minutes.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I would like to begin this discussion, talking about \nthe three pieces of legislation that are before us, to talk about the \none I believe is the least controversial of all; and that is the issue \nof fetus farming. It is a piece of legislation that I introduced, \nthanks to the great help of my staff, Heather MacLean, who has worked \ndiligently on both pieces of legislation that are on the floor today \nthat I happen to be the sponsor of, the alternatives bill as well as \nthe fetus farming bill.\n  This legislation comes as a result of a recommendation from the \nPresident's Council on Bioethics. That council, as you know, is not \nmade up of people who share the President's viewpoint on the issue of \nstem cell research. In fact, it is a rather diverse group. But they \nunanimously agreed with what they see out in the scientific world with \nrespect to research being done--where animals are being implanted with \nembryos grown to a certain gestational age and then aborted for \npurposes of research--that this should not be allowed in humans; that \nwe should not be developing embryos, implanting them in women, and then \nhaving those women abort the fetus for the purposes of doing research.\n  So the bill I have introduced follows on with the unanimous \nrecommendation of the President's Council on Bioethics. Again, it is a \ndiverse group. And they said: We should prohibit the transfer of a \nhuman embryo produced ex vivo--that is, outside of the mother's womb--\nto a woman's uterus for any purpose other than to attempt to produce a \nlive-born child.\n  That is what the first piece of legislation does, what is referred to \nas the fetus farming bill. I am hopeful we can have a broad consensus, \nhopefully a unanimous vote, on the floor of the Senate in favor of this \nlegislation. The House will hopefully pass that later today and the \nPresident will move forward and sign it.\n  The other issues I want to talk about get into a lot more detail with \nrespect to how we deal with these very difficult moral questions. I \nhave heard some say on the floor of the Senate there is no moral \nquestion here. In fact, I heard the senior Senator from New York \ncalling those who oppose this H.R. 810--which calls for the destruction \nof human embryos for purposes of deriving embryonic stem cells--he \ncalled people who oppose H.R. 810 theocrats.\n  I do not agree with the Senator from New York on a lot of things. I \nam sure the Senator from New York is motivated by his faith to do a lot \nof things in his life. I am sure there are things on the floor of the \nSenate for which the Senator from New York is motivated by his faith \ntradition and uses it as a tool which has provided him a moral \nframework for this world. But I would never call him a theocrat for \ntaking that element of his faith, which he happens to believe is \nvaluable, and applying it to a fact of circumstances before him in the \nSenate. So I would hope we would tone down that type of rhetoric. No \none is advocating theocracy here.\n  But to suggest there are not moral questions at stake, I think is \nblatantly dishonest. There was a doctor that was on a C-SPAN program \nthis morning, a doctor from Johns Hopkins, who was in favor of H.R. \n810, who got up and said it very clearly, if you believe that killing a \n5-day-old embryo is the taking of a human life, then I can understand, \nshe said, you having problems with H.R. 810. If you do not, then I can \nunderstand why you do not have a problem with H.R. 810.\n  Now, to suggest that someone who happens to believe that a 5-day-old \nembryo, that is genetically human, that if implanted in a woman would \nhave as good a chance as any other embryo in a woman to develop into \nany one of us--that we believe that killing that embryo is the taking \nof a human life--I am not too sure that goes into the bounds of \nimposing a theocracy on America.\n  I think that is, yes, to some degree, a moral question but I would \nargue, to some degree, very much a scientific question as to whether \nthat is actually human and is it alive. And the answer is, yes, it is \ngenetically human. It is like every one of us. And it is alive. If it \nwere dead, no one would be implanting it, no one would be killing it. \nSo it is human and it is alive.\n  You can say it is not human life. I can say this piece of paper is \nnot a piece of paper, but that does not make it what it is not. It is \nhuman, and it is alive. Under H.R. 810, we say that the Federal \nGovernment is going to fund research dependent on the destruction, the \nkilling of that embryo. I think it needs to be made clear there is \nnothing in the legislation--in fact, there is no bill I am aware of \nthat has been introduced--that says any individual without Government \ndollars cannot take, cannot buy or get donated a fertilized embryo, an \nembryo, a 5-day-old embryo from an in vitro fertilization clinic and do \nresearch on it. There is no law prohibiting it. There is no law \nprohibiting the killing of those embryos.\n  All of us who have concerns about H.R. 810 have concerns because this \nis Federal funding for research dependent on the destruction of human \nlife. I happen to believe that is morally objectionable. I also think \nit is scientifically objectionable too.\n  Having said that, I have one final point I would make. I do not think \nthis position is necessarily well out of the mainstream. There was a \npoll taken recently. In the poll, this question was asked: Stem cells \nare the basic cells from which all person's tissues and organs develop. \nCongress is considering the question of Federal funding for experiments \nusing stem cells from human embryos. The live embryos would be \ndestroyed in their first week of development to obtain these cells. Do \nyou support or oppose using Federal tax dollars for such experiments? \nThirty-eight percent support; almost 48 percent oppose.\n\n  I do not think those people would be called theocrats. They are not \ntheocrats. These are honest, hard-working Americans who see human life \nand say: We should treat it with dignity and not do research.\n  Now, there are obviously a sizeable number on the other side. And, \nobviously, the majority of the Senate is going to support H.R. 810. I \nrespect people who differ with me. I am not going to call them names. I \nam not going to label them something that sounds un-American. What I \nwill say is I disagree with them and will try to do so respectfully. I \nwill try to do so from the basis of someone who is a very strong \nsupporter of stem cell research. In fact, I would put my record up \nagainst just about anybody in the Senate with respect to appropriating, \nasking for, and getting appropriated dollars designated to do stem cell \nresearch.\n  I have been working for 6 years, particularly with the Pittsburgh \nTissue Engineering Institute and a whole host of companies that have \ndeveloped in and around the biotech quarter in Pittsburgh that have \nshown great promise. Some of the research you have heard about with \nrespect to alternatives to embryonic stem cell research with these \npluripotent cells--many of these companies, many of these alternatives \nhave come out of Pittsburgh, come out of the work that has advanced as \na result of some of the Federal help that we have given to the McGowan \nInstitute and to the Pittsburgh Tissue Engineering Institute.\n  In fact, we have put together such a robust program with respect to \ntissue engineering and regenerative medicine using stem cells that we \nhave partnered with the Army. President Bush, earlier this year, went \ndown to Fort Sam Houston, TX, to look at some of the work that is being \ndone with our soldiers who have been wounded and being able to \nregenerate skin or parts of bodies. In fact, there is one study \nunderway right now to regenerate an ear, actually grow back an ear of \nsomeone who lost their ear in the Iraq war.\n\n[[Page S7675]]\n\n  All of that came from the support the Congress has shown, thanks to \nthe leadership of Senator Specter and myself in this collaboration--the \nPittsburgh Tissue Engineering Institute, the McGowan Institute for \nRegenerative Medicine, the U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research, \nand on and on. This collaboration is based on the promise of stem cell \nresearch, to help our wounded soldiers. They are making dramatic and \nwonderful progress. So there is, as many have said, a tremendous \nopportunity for a lot of powerful things to help cure people with \nrespect to stem cells--these adult stem cells.\n  But I have not foreclosed, in any respect, the possibility of other \ntypes of stem cells being used, if they can be derived in an ethical \nfashion; ``ethical,'' meaning we do not sacrifice life in order to do \nresearch to find out more.\n  So what I have pursued--and what I think this alternative bill I have \nintroduced, working with Senator Specter on it--is an attempt to find \nthis middle ground. Some have suggested--I know Senator Harkin has \nrepeatedly suggested--this bill does not accomplish anything, the \nalternatives bill I have introduced does not do anything. I would \nstrongly disagree with that.\n  The alternative bill--let me give you an example. I have been working \nwith Senator Dodd over the past several months--actually, over a year \nnow--in developing a bill to provide direction to the National \nInstitutes of Health with respect to autism research. It is a vitally \nimportant bill for the autism community. It is one that the entire \ncommunity across the Nation has mobilized around, called the Combat \nAutism bill. We have worked meticulously on the language to make sure \nCongress provides direction to the NIH to ensure proper research is \nbeing done in accordance with the sensitivities of the community.\n  This bill, in many respects, is no different. What we are doing--as \nwe are doing in the Combat Autism bill, as we did by setting up centers \nof excellence within the NIH, congressional-sponsored coordinators such \nas diabetes coordinators--all of these things NIH could have done. \nCould NIH have put up, structured a diabetes coordinator? Sure. Could \nthey have set up a cancer institute? Sure. Could they have done all \nthese thing that have been congressionally mandated to do? Yes, they \ncould have. But Congress thought it was important enough that we put it \nin statute. And we direct the funding so we can get a focus on what we \nbelieve as Congress--and representing the people's belief--is important \nfor the future of medicine.\n  So in this case, yes, we are directing the National Institutes of \nHealth shall invest money--not they ``may; but they ``shall'' invest \nmoney--in developing alternatives to the destruction of the human \nembryo for the creation of pluripotent cells. In fact, there are 16 \ndifferent ideas, peer-reviewed studies showing alternative sources of \npluripotent stem cells that have been published already.\n  What we are saying to the National Institutes of Health is: Look at \nthese particular areas and others. You shall do research in this area. \nYou shall look for alternatives for the development of these \npluripotent cells. It is a directive. That is different. That is \nmeaningful. It is important. It is not: Oh, they can do it already, so \nthis is no big deal. This is a big deal. This is an important step \nforward in getting the NIH focused on an area of research which is \nethical, moral, and potentially curative for an unknown number of \ndiseases.\n  There is work being done, I can tell you, because of the work we have \ndone, and Senator Specter and I have done, in Pittsburgh with a company \ncalled Stemnion which I am very proud of. They are taking cells from \nthe lining of the placenta--I was at their lab not too long ago. They \nhad a placenta there, and they had a technician peeling off this \nsheathe from the lining of the inside of the placenta.\n  It is a three-cell layer sheet that is opaque; you can see through it \nalmost. But it is a three-cell layer which is put into a solution. They \nretrieve the middle layer of the cell. They have found that this middle \nlayer of cell can, in fact, differentiate into various types of body \ntissue, which is what we are looking for with respect to embryonic stem \ncells. They have also found that it doesn't cause tumors, which is one \nof the problems with embryonic stem cells. They are not just looking at \nthat, they are also looking at--many of these researchers who are doing \nresearch on adult stem cells, cord blood, or placenta cells, or \nwhatever--whether they can use these cells not just for direct \ntreatment but to create a broader based treatment--something that is \nnot just a treatment for the particular baby who came with that \nplacenta but whether there is a broader application with these cells.\n  Can they do things that many believe embryonic stem cells can do--\nprovide some sort of cellular solution that can be replicated in large \ndoses, instead of just individual treatments, which can be expensive \nand not necessarily as useful or helpful? So there is the potential for \nbroad-based solutions out of these pluripotent cells, something which \nthose who argue for H.R. 810 say really isn't available.\n  The fact is, that it is an objective. We don't know if it is \navailable, but, again, we don't know if embryonic stem cells will \nresult in cures because they have not to date. Senators Brownback, \nCoburn, Frist, and many others have talked about all of the different \ntherapies being used today to treat people through adult stem cell \nresearch. In fact, I mentioned one, which is the soldiers, in treating \nwound care. There are so many others. I was at another institution in \nPittsburgh where they were showing how they were treating--I know this \nwas talked about on the floor--congestive heart failure with adult stem \ncells and injecting them into the heart to try to regenerate the heart. \nSo there are all sorts of opportunities with these cells. We should \npursue that.\n  Actually, what my bill does is focus on creating embryonic-like \ncells. What my bill does is provide an alternative path to get to where \nthose who want to see embryonic stem cell research move forward want to \ngo. We try to get them there with an ethical way of doing it.\n  I am hopeful--and I have not heard anybody get up and say they would \noppose this legislation--that this legislation will pass with a very \nlarge number because I think it deserves passage. It does more than \nnothing. It does something, and it does something very important.\n  Also, I believe it is important that we stand firm and say that those \nwho may be against H.R. 810 have the opportunity to stand firm and say \nthat we are pro research, pro science, pro improving the quality of \nhealth care in this country, but we need, as public officials, to be \nthe governor for science.\n  I know there have been attempts in the past--I don't think H.R. 810 \ndoes it because it is a limited use of human embryos, but there have \nbeen attempts in the past to sort of throw the gates open and allow \nFederal funding for any type of research in this area. I think we have \nan obligation, as the voice of the people, to limit, at least with \nFederal dollars, where science goes with taxpayer dollars. This is a \nscientific society that, if you can do it, they want to do it. In my \nmind, far too many scientists don't feel any check by the moral \nimplications of creating a cloned individual, which we have seen in \nsome places around the world. There have been attempts in private labs \nin this country and around the world, and there still are attempts to \nclone individuals. We need to speak clearly into this moment. I think \nthe passage of this alternative bill does that. It says we can be pro \nscience and do so in an ethical fashion.\n  I guess I will conclude my remarks by saying that this is an \nimportant moment for us in this country. This is about the value of \nhuman life. I know people will dismiss that, saying they would be \ndiscarded anyway. All I can suggest is that every life, whether it is \nin a suspended state in an IVF clinic or standing on the floor of the \nSenate attempting to defend and protect those suspended lives, has \nmeaning. Every life deserves protection under our Constitution. Our \nConstitution protects persons. It is a very interesting word. They use \nthe term ``persons.'' So we have had a debate in this country for half \na century or more--actually since its founding--as to what a person is \nunder the Constitution. We are going to say, with respect to embryos at \nIVF clinics, that they are not people. We are going to say that this 5-\nday-old embryo created by a couple who wanted life--think about that. \nEvery one of\n\n[[Page S7676]]\n\nthese embryos was created because a couple wanted desperately to create \nhuman life, and what we are going to say is that life that was created \nis not a person, doesn't really exist from the standpoint of the \nConstitution. I think that is sort of hard for my mind to square--that \nwe create human life and then later we say it is not human life, it is \nnot a person, it is not entitled to any constitutional protections.\n  Some people have drawn lines and said it is not implanted and \ntherefore it is not human life. When the egg is fertilized, it takes a \nwhile for that embryo to implant in any normal pregnancy. In the \ninterim, is it not human life? What is it? These are questions that I \nknow are very difficult to grapple with. It is very easy--and this is \nthe caution--it is very easy, because that little embryo doesn't have a \npair of eyes, a color of hair, or a name, to dismiss this entity as \ninsignificant, particularly when we see some utilization, some \nusefulness to us in its existence. This utilitarian view that, well, we \ndon't really know what these are--at least we make the claim that we \ndon't really know what they are, so we sort of claim that there is a \ncloudiness to what this is, and it then allows us to destroy that life \nand use it for our purposes.\n  Let's be very clear about that. That is what we are doing. We are \nusing it for our purposes, to benefit us. We are using a human life to \nhelp those of us who are alive, without the permission of that silent \nembryo. You can say, well, H.R. 810 is sort of a rare circumstance. It \nis just these small groups of embryos that are unwanted. I have been on \nthe floor of the Senate debating issues of life for 12 years now. It \nseems to me that every year I come up here we tend to debate a \ndifferent issue, and if we had been debating it 10 years prior, we \nnever would have taken that position; we would have found it morally \noffensive to have argued what we argued--in this case 10 years ago. But \n10 years from now, if we allow this to happen, what will be the next \nargument of what we must do because of the potential benefit for us? \nWhat must we do next?\n  One of the principal reasons I am an avid supporter of the fetal \nfarming bill is a great fear that 10 years from now, we will be back \nhere arguing the bill again. We may find that the embryonic stem cell \nresearch that is done in the public sector--and it is being done now in \nthe private sector, and certainly there is international support for it \nin the public sector--just isn't the right thing, that they don't work \nquite as well as expected. But if you grow that embryo to a little \nlater stage and these cells settle down and are not as hyperactive as \nthese embryonic stem cells are, which have the potential of creating \ntumors, if you wait until they are a month or 2 months old, now you \nhave the right time to be able to harvest these tissues for--you name \nit. I will not say that is highly likely--I don't know, I am not a \nscientist--but I don't think that is without question. Then what would \nwe say? If we can maybe just put the embryos in artificial wombs for a \nwhile and let them develop for a little bit or maybe implant them into \na woman who volunteers, with no moral objection, to do so. You can say, \nthat is repugnant. It is today.\n  I remember when I stood on the floor and debated the partial-birth \nabortion bill--how many repugnant things I had to explain regarding the \nkilling of a child. We debated that, and it failed many times on the \nfloor of the Senate, the banning of that procedure. No, these things do \nnot happen in one great leap; they happen with just little steps, \nlittle defensible steps, little utilitarian steps, until the next time \nand the next time.\n  This is an important moment when we will say no to that and we will \ndo what I believe is important to stand up for that value. At the same \ntime, we can support a measure that is pro science. At the same time, \nwe can support a measure that says we need to move forward, we need \ncures, we need scientific experimentation, we need to develop this \nincredibly rich field of regenerative medicine and stem cell research. \nIt is an incredibly rich field, a promising field. We need to do it at \na pace and in a way that we can be proud of over time and in a way that \nrespects the dignity of the human person. But this is an incredibly \npromising field. No one on either side of this issue will deny that. It \nis an incredibly promising field, one we must pursue.\n\n  So that is why I introduced the alternative bill. That is why I \nstrongly support it, and I would encourage all of my colleagues to \nsupport it. I would encourage the House to pass it, and then we will be \nenthusiastic supporters of Senator Specter's and Senator Harkin's \nappropriations bill, to get as much money as the NIH can responsibly \nuse to develop this field fully. It is an incredibly promising field \nthat we must pursue, and we can do it. We can do it, America, ethically \nand morally, in a way that is consistent with the proud traditions of \nAmerica. Science in an ethical and moral fashion: What a nice blend. We \naccomplished that with the alternative stem cell bill, and I urge the \nSenate's adoption.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters I have received \nregarding this legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Oregon Health & Science University, Oregon Stem Cell \n           Center,\n                                      Portland, OR, July 17, 2006.\n       Dear Senator: I am a Professor in the Departments of \n     Molecular and Medical Genetics and of Pediatrics and the \n     current Director of the Oregon Stem Cell Center at Oregon \n     Health & Science University in Portland Oregon. I am also on \n     the Board of Directors of the International Society for Stem \n     Cell Research. Last month I participated in a press \n     conference at the Capital in support of the Alternative \n     Pluripotent Stem Cell Therapies Enhancement Act, S. 2754, \n     sponsored by Senators Santorum and Specter. I am writing to \n     affirm the solid scientific foundations for this approach and \n     to urge you to vote in favor of this very important \n     legislation.\n       Let me begin by stating clearly that I do not think that \n     adult stem cells have all the properties of pluripotent \n     embryonic stem cells (ESC) and could be used to replace or \n     substitute for them in therapeutic or scientific \n     investigations. ESC indeed hold tremendous--albeit at this \n     point mostly unrealized--potential for significant \n     improvements of human health. My objection to using human \n     embryonic stem cells is the fact that their procurement \n     involves the destruction of early human life, generated \n     either by in vitro fertilization or by cloning. Exploitation \n     and destruction of human embryos is morally unacceptable to \n     me and to millions of others in the United States and around \n     the world.\n       Fortunately, science strongly suggests that there is a \n     solution to this particular moral quandary. All cells of the \n     human body share the exact same DNA sequence, regardless of \n     whether they are adult skin cells or embryos. The fate and \n     nature of a cell (embryo vs. other cell type) is not \n     determined by its DNA sequence but by which genes are active \n     or silenced. Silent genes can be activated and active genes \n     can be silenced through skilled laboratory manipulation. This \n     is why it is possible to use the nucleus of an adult cell to \n     make an embryo, as was done with Dolly the sheep. The \n     contents of the egg are able to ``flip genetic switches''. \n     Recently, multiple labs in the United States and from around \n     the world have published or reported experiments in which \n     adult cells were converted, not to embryos, but directly to \n     pluripotent ``embryonic-like'' cells. The resulting cells \n     were virtually indistinguishable from embryonic stem cells \n     derived from embryos. The techniques used have included \n     altered nuclear transfer (ANT), cell fusion and chemical \n     reprogramming. The results were obtained by top scientists in \n     the field and published in the best journals.\n       To date the direct conversion of adult cells to pluripotent \n     stem cells without any embryo destruction has only been \n     achieved in animals, but it is highly likely that this can be \n     done with human cells as well. In addition to being ethically \n     and morally unimpeachable the alternative methods also \n     promise a major clinical/medical advantage: pluripotent cells \n     generated by these techniques will be tissue-matched to the \n     patient. In contrast to embryonic stem cells derived from \n     ``discarded'' embryos, immune suppression would not be needed \n     to use these cells in transplantation.\n       Thus, compelling scientific and ethical arguments exist for \n     non-embryo destructive alternative methods. S. 2754, the \n     Alternative Pluripotent Stem Cell Therapies Enhancement Act, \n     represents an important tool to advance the development of \n     these techniques to the benefit of all.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Markus Grompe, M.D.,\n     Professor.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 17, 2006.\n       Dear Senator: I am a physician and a Consulting Professor \n     in the Neuroscience Institute at Stanford where for many \n     years I have taught courses in biomedical ethics. I have also \n     served on the President's Council on Bioethics since its \n     inception in January 2002.\n       In May 2005, the Council issued a White Paper entitled \n     ``Alternative Sources of Human Pluripotent Stem Cells.'' This \n     report outlined four proposals for obtaining pluripotent stem \n     cells (cells with the same\n\n[[Page S7677]]\n\n     properties and potentials as embryonic stem cells) using \n     techniques that do not involve the destruction of human \n     embryos. As the author of one of these proposals, Altered \n     Nuclear Transfer, I am writing to inform you of encouraging \n     progress in establishing both the scientific feasibility and \n     the moral acceptability of this proposal. In what follows, I \n     am of course speaking for myself, not for the Council as a \n     whole or for any other institution.\n       Altered Nuclear Transfer (ANT) is a broad concept with a \n     range of possible approaches. ANT draws on the basic \n     technique of nuclear transfer (popularly known as \n     `therapeutic cloning') but with a pre-emptive alteration such \n     that pluripotent stem cells are produced without the creation \n     and destruction of human embryos. Unlike the use of embryos \n     produced by in vitro fertilization, ANT would allow the \n     production of pluripotent stem cell lines of specific genetic \n     types. This would enable standardized scientific studies of \n     genetic diseases controlled testing for drug development, and \n     possibly patient-specific immune-compatible cell therapies.\n       In the year since the publication of the Council report, \n     major advances in this project have been documented in peer-\n     reviewed research articles published in leading scientific \n     journals.\n       In January 2006, the journal Nature reported research by \n     MIT stem cell biologists Rudolf Jaenisch and Alexander \n     Meissner demonstrating, in mouse studies, scientific proof-\n     of-principle for Altered Nuclear Transfer. The authors \n     described this technique as ``simple and straightforward,'' \n     and, in testimony to a U.S. Senate subcommittee on stem cell \n     research, Dr. Jaenisch stated: ``Because the ANT product \n     lacks essential properties of the fertilized embryo, it is \n     not justified to call it an `embryo.' ''\n       One month later, research by developmental biologist \n     Michael Roberts of the University of Missouri published in \n     the journal Science, suggested that the same ANT approach \n     might be accomplished more directly and by an even simpler \n     technique.\n       In March 2006, at a conference of scientists, moral \n     philosophers and religious leaders organized by The \n     Westchester Institute for Ethics and the Human Person, there \n     was unanimous agreement that if further refinement of these \n     techniques is successful with non-human primates, cautious \n     extension of these approaches to studies with human cells \n     would be morally acceptable.\n       This conclusion has received further support from research \n     reported by Hans Schoeler, Chair of the Department of Cell \n     and Developmental Biology at the Max Planck Institute in \n     Germany. Using the same basic alterations, he was able to \n     establish pluripotent stem cells from these non-embryonic \n     laboratory constructs at a rate of efficiency 50% higher than \n     current embryo-destructive techniques (that use IVF embryos). \n     This suggests that ANT may have both scientific and moral \n     advantages.\n       In the attached letter, Dr. Schoeler explains: \n     ``Biologically (and morally), I would not consider such a . . \n     . laboratory product to be a living being, but more rightly \n     would consider it a single-lineage tissue culture. ``He \n     continues, ``Although these studies have been conducted using \n     mice, it is reasonable to expect that the mammalian pattern \n     of embryogenesis is conserved to the degree that a similar \n     result would be obtained with human cells. These research \n     results suggest that Altered Nuclear Transfer may be able to \n     produce human pluripotent stem cells (the functional \n     equivalent of embryonic stem cells) in a manner that is \n     simpler and more efficient than current methods. Moreover, by \n     doing so without creating a human embryo, such a project may \n     resolve our current impasse over embryonic stem cell research \n     and allow social consensus in support of this important new \n     field of biomedical science.''\n       Altered Nuclear Transfer is just one of several promising \n     approaches that may allow a resolution of our current \n     conflict over federal funding of stem cell research. There is \n     also encouraging progress in `direct reprogramming', another \n     proposal discussed in the Council report. If we can learn the \n     specific chemical factors in an egg that are necessary for \n     reprogramming, we may be able to combine these factors with \n     the nucleus of any adult body cell and produce a patient-\n     specific, genetically matched pluripotent stem cell line. \n     Furthermore, over a dozen types of cells from tissues as \n     diverse as bone marrow, brain, fat, testis, and even placenta \n     appear to share some of the properties of pluripotent cells. \n     It is too early to claim these cells are the functional \n     equivalent of embryonic stem cells, but thorough exploration \n     of their potentials is obviously worthy of directed federal \n     support.\n       Our current conflict over the moral status of the human \n     embryo reflects deep differences in our basic convictions and \n     is unlikely to be resolved through deliberation or debate. \n     Likewise, a purely political solution will leave our country \n     bitterly divided, eroding the social support and sense of \n     noble purpose that is essential for the public funding of \n     biomedical science. The President's Council on Bioethics \n     Alternative Sources report challenges our nation to seek a \n     solution that sustains the important human values being \n     promoted by both sides of this difficult debate. These \n     projects are feasible using current technologies, and the \n     scientific information gained in their investigation would \n     have broad value even beyond the immediate goals of stem cell \n     research.\n       Senate bill 2754, The Alternative Pluripotent Stem Cell \n     Therapies Enhancement Act of 2006, would provide crucial \n     support for these projects. In reaching beyond the moral \n     controversies that divide our nation, Senators Santorum and \n     Specter have offered us a way forward with stem cell \n     research, ``one small island of unity within a sea of \n     controversy.''\n           Sincerely,\n     William B. Hurlbut, M.D.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            National Right to Life\n\n\n                                              Committee, Inc.,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 13, 2006.\n       Dear Senator: With the Senate scheduled to vote on H.R. 810 \n     on July 18, we write to express the strong opposition of the \n     National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) to this legislation, \n     which would mandate federal funding of research that requires \n     the killing of human embryos. NRLC will include the roll call \n     on passage of H.R. 810 in its scorecard of key pro-life votes \n     for the l09th Congress.\n       Each human being begins as a human embryo, male or female. \n     The government should not fund research that requires the \n     killing of living members of the species Homo sapiens. H.R. \n     810 would require federal funding of research projects on \n     stem cells taken from human embryos who are alive today, and \n     who would be killed by the very act of removing their stem \n     cells for the research--a practice very different from that \n     of the human being who dies by accident and whose organs are \n     then donated to others.\n       Stem cells can be obtained without killing human embryos, \n     from umbilical cord blood and from many types of ``adult'' \n     (non-embryonic) tissue. Already, humans with at least 72 \n     different diseases and conditions have received therapeutic \n     benefit from treatment with such ``adult'' stem cells. In \n     contrast, embryonic stem cells have not been tested in humans \n     for any purpose because of the dangers demonstrated in animal \n     studies, including frequent formation of tumors.\n       Those who favor federal funding of research that kills \n     human embryos sometimes claim that these embryos ``will be \n     discarded anyway,'' but this need not be so. Many human \n     embryos have been adopted while they were still embryos, or \n     simply donated by their biological parents to other infertile \n     couples. Today they are children indistinguishable from any \n     others.\n       Prior to the vote on H.R. 810, the Senate will vote on S. \n     3504, the Fetus Farming Prohibition Act, and S. 2754, the \n     Alternative Pluripotent Stem Cell Therapies Enhancement Act. \n     We encourage you to support both S. 3504 and S. 2754.\n       S. 3504 would make it a federal offense for a researcher to \n     use tissue from a human baby who has been gestated in a \n     woman's womb, or an animal womb, for the purpose of providing \n     such tissue. Some researchers have already conducted such \n     ``fetus farming'' experiments with animals--for example, by \n     gestating cloned calves to four months and then aborting them \n     to obtain certain tissues for transplantation. This research \n     is obviously being pursued because of its potential \n     application in humans.\n       S. 2754, the Alternative Pluripotent Stem Cell Therapies \n     Enhancement Act, would require the National Institutes of \n     Health to support research to try to find methods of creating \n     pluripotent stem ce11s (which are cells that can be turned \n     into many sorts of body tissue) without creating or harming \n     human embryos. The bill does not endorse any particular \n     method, and does not allow funding of any research that would \n     create or harm human embryos.\n       For additional information, please contact the NRLC Federal \n     Legislation Department at 202-626-8820 or Legfederal@aol.com. \n     Additional resources are available at the NRLC Human Embryos \n     webpage at www.nrlc.org/killing_embryos/index.html and at \n     http://www.stemcellresearch.org/\n Sincerely,\n     David N. O'Steen, Ph.D.,\n       NRLC Executive Director;\n     Douglas Johnson,\n       Legislative Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   Secretariat for\n\n\n                                          Pro-Life Activities,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 12, 2006.\n       Dear Senator: In accordance with a unanimous consent \n     agreement approved on June 29, the Senate may soon vote on \n     three bills relating to bioethics and stem cell research: \n     H.R. 810, S. 2754 and S. 3504. On behalf of the U.S. \n     Conference of Catholic Bishops I am writing to comment on \n     each proposal.\n\n\n            h.r. 810, ``stem cell research enhancement act''\n\n       This bill violates a decades-long policy against forcing \n     taxpayers to support the destruction of early human life. \n     Federal funds would promote research using ``new'' embryonic \n     stem cell lines, encouraging researchers to destroy countless \n     human embryos to provide more cell lines and qualify for \n     federal grants. However, no alleged future ``promise'' can \n     justify promoting the destruction of innocent human life here \n     and now, whatever its age or condition.\n       The argument that ``excess'' embryos may be discarded by \n     clients anyway is morally deficient. Such arguments have been \n     rejected by our government in all other contexts, as when \n     harmful experiments have been proposed on death-row prisoners \n     or on unborn children intended for abortion. The fact that \n     others may do harm to these nascent lives gives Congress no \n     right to join in the killing, much less to make everyone else \n     complicit in it through their tax dollars.\n       While these moral considerations are paramount, it is also \n     worth noting that the factual assumptions behind the \n     embryonic stem\n\n[[Page S7678]]\n\n     cell campaign are questionable. Embryonic stem cell research \n     is not showing the remarkable ``promise'' claimed by \n     supporters, but lags far behind adult stem cells and other \n     approaches that are providing real treatments for dozens of \n     conditions. Experts now predict that treatments may emerge in \n     ``decades'' or not at all. Other experts admit that use of \n     so-called ``spare'' embryos is only a transitional step in \n     any case, that creating human embryos (by cloning or by in \n     vitro fertilization) solely for destructive research will be \n     the next essential step. We also know that only 3% of frozen \n     embryos in fertility clinics are designated by their parents \n     for use in research--ensuring that attempts to move toward \n     large-scale research or treatments will require creating and \n     destroying new human lives on a massive scale.\n       In the name of sound ethics and responsible science, \n     Congress should reject H.R. 810.\n\n\n  s. 2754, ``alternative pluripotent stem cell therapies enhancement \n                                 act''\n\n       Even supporters of destructive embryo research have said \n     that ``the derivation of stem cells from embryos remaining \n     following infertility treatments is justifiable only if no \n     less morally problematic alternatives are available for \n     advancing the research'' (National Bioethics Advisory \n     Commission, Ethical Issues in Human Stem Cell Research, Sept. \n     1999, Vol. I, p. 53). Congress has a responsibility to \n     explore how such research may be advanced without creating \n     moral problems.\n       S. 2754 serves this important goal, by funding efforts to \n     derive and study cells which have the capabilities of \n     embryonic stem cells but are not obtained from a human \n     embryo. For example, many studies suggest that stem cells \n     from adult tissues and umbilical cord blood already have the \n     versatility once thought to exist only in embryonic cells, or \n     may acquire this versatility by various forms of \n     ``reprogramming.'' Pluripotent stem cells may or may not have \n     advantages over other stem cells for some forms of research--\n     and such advantages, if any, are most likely not in the area \n     of providing direct treatments for patients. But the effort \n     to explore all feasible avenues of research that do not \n     attack human life is worth pursuing.\n       This bill does not fund research using human embryos, and \n     references a careful definition of ``human embryo'' in the \n     Labor/HHS appropriations bill that has served the cause of \n     ethical research very well since 1996. In the case of any \n     technique whose nature is uncertain, the bill provides for \n     additional basic and animal research, to make certain that \n     the technique does not create or harm embryos before it can \n     be applied to humans. In short, it defines a clear and \n     responsible policy that should be supported by defenders of \n     the sanctity of human life, as well as by those tempted to \n     support stem cell research that destroys life.\n\n\n               S. 3504, ``fetus farming prohibition act''\n\n       This bill amends current federal law against abuses in the \n     area of fetal tissue research, to prevent the most egregious \n     abuse of all: the use of human fetal tissue (such as fetal \n     stem cells) obtained by growing human embryos in a human or \n     animal uterus in order to provide such tissue.\n       Because no member of Congress has voiced support for such \n     atrocities, the only argument against this bill may be that \n     it is not needed because no one wants to do such a thing. I \n     wish this were true. But in fact, most animal studies cited \n     as ``proof of principle'' for so-called therapeutic cloning \n     have required exactly this--placing cloned animal embryos in \n     a womb and growing them to the fetal stage to obtain usable \n     stem cells. Some researchers call this the new ``paradigm'' \n     for human treatments from cloning. And while the \n     biotechnology industry insists it has no interest in \n     maintaining cloned human embryos past 14 days, it has \n     supported state laws such as one enacted in New Jersey which \n     allow such ``fetus farming'' into the ninth month of \n     pregnancy to harvest body parts. (See ``Research Cloning and \n     `Fetus Farming' '' at www.usccb.org/prolife/issues/bioethic/\ncloning/farmfact31805.htm.) Now is the time to enact a \n     national policy against such grotesque abuse of women and \n     children, by approving S. 3504.\n       In short, the Senate has an opportunity to approve two \n     bills that respect both science and ethics--and to reject \n     misguided legislation that ignores ethical demands in its \n     pursuit or an ever more speculative and elusive ``progress.'' \n     Technical progress that makes humans themselves into mere raw \n     material for research is in fact a regress in our humanity. \n     Therefore, I strongly urge you to oppose H.R. 810, and to \n     approve the other two bills proposed as part of this \n     agreement.\n           Sincerely,\n     Cardinal William H. Keeler,\n       Archbishop of Baltimore, Chairman, Committee for Pro-Life \n     Activities, U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n                                  ____\n\n         The Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern \n           Baptist Convention,\n                                     Nashville, TN, July 17, 2006.\n     Hon. Rick Santorum,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Santorum: The U.S. Senate will vote this week \n     on three crucial bills dealing with the sanctity of human \n     life. Two bills promote ethical means of research, while the \n     third promotes the unethical destruction of human embryos. We \n     support passage of S. 3504, The Fetus Farming Prohibition Act \n     of 2006, and S. 2754, The Alternative Pluripotent Stem Cell \n     Therapies Enhancement Act. We oppose in strongest possible \n     terms passage of H.R. 810, The Stem Cell Research Enhancement \n     Act of 2005.\n       The Fetus Farming Prohibition Act of 2006 (S. 3504) would \n     make it a federal offense for a researcher to use tissue from \n     a human baby who has been gestated in a woman's or an \n     animal's womb for the purpose of providing such tissue. This \n     respectable bill would prevent the manufacture and ultimate \n     abortion of human fetuses for research, a practice that would \n     create life for the sole purpose of destroying it.\n       The Alternative Pluripotent Stem Cell Therapies Enhancement \n     Act (S. 2754) would provide new federal funding for research \n     on alternative means for producing pluripotent stem cells \n     without creating or harming human embryos. This is an ethical \n     alternative to the third bill, H.R. 810, which would instead \n     provide federal tax dollars for stem cell research on embryos \n     created at in vitro fertilization (IVF) clinics.\n       The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2005 (H.R. 810) \n     would overturn President Bush's longstanding policy that bars \n     federal funding of research that involves killing additional \n     human embryos to obtain stem cells. Researchers who take stem \n     cells from embryos created by IVF destroy humans who might \n     otherwise be given the opportunity of birth, like the 100 \n     ``snowflake'' babies who have been adopted as embryos from \n     IVF clinics in the United States. Frozen embryos are clearly \n     not ``unwanted'' as many of the bill's supporters claim, and \n     must not be seen as expendable resources for the sake of so-\n     called ``more valuable lives.'' Proponents of H.R. 810 claim \n     that embryonic stem cell research could lead to the discovery \n     of cures for diseases. However, to date it has been a \n     fruitless pursuit yielding not even a single treatment for a \n     disease. Research on non-embryonic stem cells, on the other \n     hand, has produced treatments for 70 ailments, often with \n     dramatic results.\n       We must seek to protect human life at all stages and \n     promote only ethical stem cell research. The votes on these \n     three bills directly affect whether or not human life will be \n     protected from conception to birth in the United States. Your \n     assistance in assuring passage of S. 3504 and S. 2754 and \n     defeat of H.R. 810 will be greatly appreciated.\n           In His Service,\n                                                 Dr. Richard Land.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority controls the next 30 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield\n3\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Menendez.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of millions of \nAmericans and their families holding out hope that the Senate will do \nthe right thing today, which is to support embryonic stem cell research \nso that scientists have the resources they need to potentially save \nmillions of lives.\n  I voted for the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act when I was in the \nHouse, and I strongly support it.\n  My support for this promising research is painfully personal. When I \nvisit my mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's, and see her vacant \nstare, in which she doesn't even recognize her own family, I just \ncannot comprehend how anyone in this body can vote against this bill \nand deny families their last hope for a cure from the loneliness and \nconfusion caused by this horrible disease.\n  Embryonic stem cells have the ability to grow into virtually any cell \nin the body and thus have the potential to cure people like my mother \nand many others. That is why this research is so vitally important.\n  Millions of Americans just like my family are waiting in hope that we \nwill do the right thing. Those with loved ones suffering from \nAlzheimer's, Parkinson's, or juvenile diabetes wait in hope that their \nprayers will be answered and cures will be found in their lifetime. \nAcross America, families in which a child or a parent is paralyzed from \na traumatic accident hold out hope that we will do the right thing and \ngive their loved ones back the life they knew before their injury.\n  President Bush and other opponents of this legislation know all too \nwell the overwhelming public support for this promising research, but \nthey still can't bring themselves to stand up for the people's \ninterests over the special interests, stand up for sound science over \nideology. Instead, they say one thing and do another.\n  You can't say you support cures, then turn around and oppose the most \npromising research. You can't say you support research and turn around \nand oppose the vital funding that will make breakthroughs possible.\n  For those who insist on playing politics with people's lives, make no \nmistake about it: The American people are\n\n[[Page S7679]]\n\nwatching, and they will not take kindly to seeing their last flicker of \nhope being extinguished.\n  The only thing more callous than no hope is false hope.\n  To those who say they are for research but vote against this \nlegislation, they must answer to the mother who must care for her child \nwho can't walk because of a spinal cord injury, to the wife who must \nhelp her ailing husband battling Parkinson's disease, to the father \nforced to watch his daughter inject herself with countless insulin \nneedles for the rest of her life.\n  By saying one thing and doing another on this issue, you are creating \nfalse hope and putting these and millions of other families on yet \nanother roller coaster of despair. I know this is true because my \nsister and I and our children deal with it when we look into the eyes \nof my mother who no longer recognizes our faces. My mother and her \nterrible suffering brought me to this fight, but my children and the \nhope for a cure for future generations inspires me to keep fighting.\n  We have an obligation to stand up and do what is right today in the \nSenate. American families and future generations simply cannot afford \nfor us to fail them now.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Feinstein.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the manager of the bill. In \njust a short hour or so, the Senate will finally vote on passage of \nthis important stem cell act. This is a long time coming.\n  I believe and hope that we are going to have a very strong vote in \nfavor of this critical scientific research. I also hope that President \nBush will reverse his earlier veto threat and sign this bill that holds \nsuch promise for so many Americans suffering from catastrophic illness.\n  This issue, and this debate, is really about hope. It is about giving \nhope of a scientific breakthrough to millions of Americans suffering \nfrom chronic, debilitating, and devastating disease.\n  We can't stand here on the Senate floor and pretend that we know \nwhich scientific advances will cure diabetes, ALS, or cancer. \nUnfortunately, some of my colleagues have done just that. They have \ninsisted that adult stem cells and cord blood cells are being \nsuccessfully used to treat at least 65 illnesses. They argue that there \nis no reason to move forward with this bill, no reason to make new \nlines of stem cells available. However, adult stem cells present \nserious limitations and embryonic stem cell research offers unique \npromise.\n  Embryonic cells derived from embryos are pluripotent, meaning they \ncan become any type of cell. Adult stem cells cannot, and, therefore, \ntheir application is limited. These embryonic cells are easy to grow, \nisolate, and study. Adult stem cells are harder to grow in a lab. These \nembryonic cells can divide. They can renew themselves for long periods. \nAdult stem cells, on the other hand, exist only in small amounts. All \nthese properties make these stem cells an excellent target for \nscientific exploration.\n  Now, there have been heartrending stories of people suffering from \ndiseases such as leukemia and other blood disorders who experience \nrelief from adult stem cells or cord blood cells, and that is just \ngreat. This progress is encouraging and it should move forward. But \nthese advances in treatments have not addressed the needs of patients \nsuffering from other diseases.\n  In juvenile diabetes, for example, scientists have discovered that \nadult stem cells in the pancreas do not play an effective role in \ninsulin production. To cure the disease, doctors will need insulin-\nproducing cells to inject into their diabetic patients. This is done \nnow on a limited basis, but there aren't enough donor cells available. \nStem cells could change this. They could provide an unlimited amount of \ncells that are compatible with the patient, making anti-rejection drugs \nsimply unnecessary. Of course, if we don't let our scientists try, we \nwill never know.\n\n  Dr. Douglas Kerr of Johns Hopkins--and I used this yesterday on the \nfloor--headed a team that used embryonic stem cells to treat 15 rats \nthat had been paralyzed by an aggressive infection that had destroyed \ntheir cord nerve cells. Eleven of these rats experienced significant \nrecovery. They regained enough strength to bear weight and take steps \non their previously paralyzed hind quarters.\n  A few years ago, no one thought this could be done. Dr. Kerr explains \nthat this is, in essence, a cookbook recipe to restore lost nerve \nfunction, and that this procedure could some day be used to repair \ndamage from ALS, multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injuries.\n  He says:\n\n       With small adjustments keyed to differences in nervous \n     system targets, the approach may also apply to patients with \n     Parkinson's or Huntington's disease.\n\n  The NIH Director, Dr. Zerhouni, called this a remarkable advance that \ncan help us understand how stem cells can begin to fulfill their great \npromise. What an advance this would be. Can you imagine if you could \nregenerate the spinal cord, once again, and if paraplegics and \nquadriplegics could again function? That is what this bright frontier \nis all about. That is what is so very important.\n  All of this takes time. Scientists first isolated human embryonic \nstem cells only 8 years ago, and in that time they have learned a \nsubstantial amount about how these cells work and how they could one \nday be used in treatment.\n  But there is also a lot we don't know. Some have suggested because \nthere have been no miraculous cures in this 8-year period, there will \nnever be useful treatments that come from this technology. But none of \nthe great feats of scientific inquiry have been simple. That is for \nsure. Scientific progress takes time and investment. Our researchers \ntoday have made discoveries, many in mice, that could prove just as \nrevolutionary as the introduction of penicillin in the 1940s. These \npreliminary discoveries will amount to nothing unless researchers have \naccess to Federal funding and viable stem cell lines to move forward.\n  In the last 2 days we have heard a great deal about the hope that the \npassage of Castle-DeGette would bring to patients and their families.\n  I would like to say a final word about hope. I simply cannot believe \nthat President Bush would select this legislation as his first veto as \nPresident of the United States. I know that he has issued a veto \nthreat, but think about it. Think about the millions of people. Think \nabout the fact that if you are really pro-life, these embryos--which \nwill never become human life, which are discarded, which will not be \nused, which are the product of in vitro fertilization--these embryos \nare never going to be babies, as the opposition would have us believe. \nThink of the lives that these embryos might save some day. People \nparalyzed, people with juvenile diabetes, young people with Parkinson's \ndisease who can't move and who have trouble speaking--think about what \nthis can mean in terms of being for life.\n  That is why I think if the President thinks about this, we all have \nthe hope on this side of the question that he will not veto this \nlegislation.\n  The President himself recognized the promise of stem cell research \nback in 2001 when he attempted to find a middle ground. But 5 years \nlater, it is apparent, there is no middle ground. We need embryonic \nstem cell research, and this is the way to do it. I am hopeful that \nthis body will vote aye.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California and \nalso the next speaker, Senator Kennedy, for their great leadership over \nall of these years to give hope to so many Americans. I yield 10 \nminutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to extend, as I think all of us in \nthis body want to, appreciation to the Senator from Iowa, as well as \nthe Senator from California and the Senator from Pennsylvania, for \ntheir long, continuing, and ongoing leadership in such an important \narea for families in this country.\n  This afternoon, the debate on stem cell research will draw to a \nclose. For Senators, life will go on. Next week, the Senate will deal \nwith other issues and other questions. But millions of Americans don't \nhave that luxury. For them, the struggle against disease isn't \nsomething they think about for a few brief days. It is something they \nconfront every day of their lives.\n  A child coping with endless injections of insulin and constant \nworries\n\n[[Page S7680]]\n\nabout blood sugar cannot simply turn away from this debate. Someone \nwatching helplessly as a parent or a spouse succumbs to the tremors of \nParkinson's disease cannot simply move on to other concerns.\n  For us, a vote on stem cell research may take only a few moments in a \nbusy day. But for millions of Americans, the consequences of our vote \nmay last a lifetime.\n  Should this lifesaving legislation pass through Congress, President \nBush has said he will veto it. The President may believe that ends the \ndebate, but it does not. This debate will continue as long as lives are \ndiminished and cut short by diseases and injuries that stem cells might \ncure. This debate will go on as long as there are those of us who \nbelieve that rather than discard unwanted embryos, we should embrace \nthem to bring fuller lives to millions of people.\n  For their sake our battle continues--tomorrow, next week, next month, \nand in the days ahead. To those who suffer and cling to hope, we \npromise that we will never give up. The promise of a better day that \nembryonic stem cell research brings cannot be denied forever.\n  I want to take a moment to address some of the arguments our \nopponents on this issue have made during this debate. Dr. Thomas \nMurray, one of the Nation's leading scholars in bioethics, has a simple \nsaying: ``Good ethics starts with good facts.'' It is like John Adams, \nwho said, ``Facts are stubborn things.'' Sadly, on this most important \nethical issue we have heard some very questionable allegations.\n  We have heard that adult stem cells have conquered disease after \ndisease and therefore our legislation is not needed, but the facts tell \na different story. The Nation's leading scientific society, the \nAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science, recently published \nan extensive study that disputes these claims. Contrary to the \nallegation of opponents of our bill, adult stem cells have not treated \nParkinson's disease, cancer, lymphoma, brain tumors, multiple \nsclerosis, arthritis, lupus, sickle cell anemia, heart damage, spinal \ncord injuries, and many other conditions.\n  The Cancer Research and Prevention Foundation was so concerned about \nthe misleading claims that adult stem cells are curing cancer that they \nsent Congress a letter setting the record straight. Their letter states \nthat the studies used to support these claims are ``not extensive and \nby no means prove that adult stem cells are effective in treating these \ncancers.''\n  In fact, out of the hundreds of diseases and injuries that our \nlegislation might address, only nine have shown promise for treatment \nwith adult stem cells. Let's hope that in time this situation changes. \nIf adult stem cells can cure cancer or Parkinson's disease or spinal \ninjury in the future, we will all--all rejoice.\n  But we must not foreclose the chance of progress with embryonic stem \ncells while this possibility is tested. No matter how deeply held the \nconvictions are of those who oppose our legislation, they cannot erase \nthe facts. The objective evidence has convinced the Nation's leading \nmedical experts that embryonic stem cell research has unique potential \nand unparalleled promise.\n  Our opponents have also said that because there have as yet been no \ncures from embryonic stem cells, we should continue to restrict the \nresearch. Is it truly a surprise that a discovery made only a few years \nago has yet to move to the clinic, especially when NIH has been \nprohibited from funding the most promising areas of research?\n  Knowledge about the function of DNA is the foundation of modern \nmedical science. It underlies the development of every major new drug \nand medical treatment today. In 1973, scientists discovered how to \nsplice pieces of DNA together, the fundamental breakthrough that led to \nthe biotechnology wonders of today. But there were no clinical trials \nor new cures based on that historic discovery for years that followed.\n  Human embryonic stem cells were discovered in 1998. Of course, they \nhave not led to a range of new cures in the brief time since then, just \nas discovering how to splice DNA did not lead to immediate clinical \nbreakthroughs. But it would be just as foolish to keep restricting stem \ncell research today as it would have been to stop basic DNA research in \nthe 1970s because it did not produce instant cures.\n  The ethical debate surrounding stem cell research is not unique. Such \ndebates have accompanied many breakthroughs and new therapies. It is \nessential for researchers to be bound by strict ethical guidelines, \nespecially in the early days of a new science as we seek to understand \nits potential. Such controversy also accompanied other lifesaving and \nbeneficial medical developments, such as DNA research and in vitro \nfertilization. But now, DNA research has saved lives and is alleviating \nsuffering. And IVF has brought the joy of parenthood to couples across \nAmerica. Would any of us turn back the clock and shun the new medicines \nthat DNA research has brought? Would any of us deny the joy of children \nto those able to conceive only through IVF? Of course not.\n  In a few short minutes, the Senate will decide whether to open the \nextraordinary promise of stem cell research to millions of Americans \nwho look to it with hope for new cures and a better day.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator has 2 minutes 45 \nseconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Two years ago I held a forum on stem cell research. One \nof the participants was Moira McCarthy Stanford from Plymouth, MA, \nwhose 14-year-old daughter was suffering from juvenile diabetes. I \nreceived this letter from her:\n       For as long as I can remember, I've had to take a lot of \n     leaps of faith. I've had to believe my parents when they told \n     me taking four or five shots a day and pricking my finger \n     eight or more times a day was just ``a new kind of normal.'' \n     I've had to just smile and say I'm fine when a high blood \n     sugar or low blood sugar forced me to the sidelines in a big \n     soccer game; or into the base lodge on a perfect ski day; or \n     out of the pool during a swim meet.\n       But when I watched, with my parents, President Bush's \n     decision on Stem Cell research in the summer of 2001, I just \n     could not accept it. You see the one thing that has helped me \n     accept all I've had to accept these years is the presence of \n     hope. Hope keeps me going.\n       That night, President Bush talked about protecting the \n     innocent. I wondered then: what about me? I am truly innocent \n     in this situation. I did nothing to bring my diabetes on; \n     there is nothing I can do to make it any better. All I can do \n     is hope for a research breakthrough and keep living the \n     difficult, demanding life of a child with diabetes until that \n     breakthrough comes. How, I asked my parents, is it more \n     important to throw discarded embryos into the trash than it \n     is to let them be used to hopefully save my life.\n       I am so happy to hear that the Senate is thinking of \n     passing H.R. 810. I can dream again--dream of that great time \n     when I write a thank you letter to the Senate, the House and \n     everyone who helped me become just another girl; a girl who \n     dreamed and hoped and one day, got just what she wanted: her \n     health and future. That's all I'm really asking for.\n\n  Mr. President, in a few moments we will have the opportunity to \nanswer her. I hope the answer will be in the affirmative.\n  I yield whatever time remains.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \noffer my perspectives on the issue currently being debated by the \nSenate, stem cell research. The debate over this issue in the Senate is \nlong overdue. The promise this research holds for finding treatments or \ncures for diseases such as Alzheimer's, diabetes, Parkinson's, Lou \nGehrig's disease and cancer is immeasurable.\n  It has been 5 years since the President announced his \nadministration's restrictive policy on stem cell research, a policy \nthat limited the number of stem cell lines available for use with \nFederal funding. All of these lines are contaminated by the use of \nmouse feeder cells and will likely never meet the standards required \nfor human treatment. The United States leads the world in the medical \nexpertise that can find cures and treatments for these scourges. But it \nhas become abundantly clear that the President's restrictive policy is \nhindering scientific progress toward the discovery in the United States \nof possible cures and treatments for many fatal diseases that affect \nmillions of Americans, and millions more around the world.\n  More than a year ago, our colleagues in the House passed legislation \nthat would reverse the President's limiting policy. Since then, as we \nhave all waited for the Senate to act, many more who suffer from \ncatastrophic illness and could have been helped by research\n\n[[Page S7681]]\n\nof this kind have passed away. Many of us are grieving the loss of Dana \nReeve, a vocal advocate for stem cell research, who lost her battle \nwith cancer last March. She and her husband, Christopher Reeve, had \nbecome two of the public faces in the struggle for advancement of stem \ncell research.\n  The Senate will vote on three stem cell bills today. However, H.R. \n810 is the only bill that will give real reason for hope to millions of \nAmericans and their families. Take the case of a woman from my State of \nVermont who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1999. Forced to \ngive up her career as a musician because she could no longer use her \nhands to play the piano, she began working as a clerk in a gift store, \nonly to have to give up that job because she had trouble handling money \nand sometimes broke the items in the store. Her plea to me--and really \nto all of us--is deeply moving. Listen to her appeal: ``If there is any \nchance stem cell research might help MS, it must be done. There is \nnothing else for MS patients to look forward to . . .''\n  I would like to address two of the arguments that opponents of this \nstem cell research offer against the passage of H.R. 810. They contend \nthat there is no need for public funding of this research because \nprivate funds are available in some situations. While there are private \ndollars being used for embryonic stem cell research, public funds are \nneeded to spur on this research, to lead this research effort to the \ncutting edge of progress, and to harness the work of our National \nInstitutes of Health. Public funding is also needed to keep the United \nStates competitive with other countries in this arena.\n  At the University of Vermont, for example, researchers are using bone \nmarrow stem cells to repair damaged tissues in various organs. This \nwork could be expanded with the infusion of Federal research dollars.\n  A second misdirected argument is that this embryonic stem cell \nresearch is not needed because alternatives to embryonic research hold \nmore promise than the current method. Some argue that embryonic stem \ncell research is not needed because it has not yielded any results. \nHowever, none of the proposed alternatives has proven successful for \nderiving human stem cells, and there is no guarantee that any of them \never will. While it is true that embryonic stem cell research has not \nyet led to human therapies, it is important to remember that this field \nis only in its infancy. This is because President Bush's restrictions \nhave prevented federally funded investigators from fully exploring the \npotential of this research.\n  The President has indicated his intent to veto H.R. 810 should the \nSenate pass this bill. I join my colleagues in urging him not to use \nthe first veto of his administration to block funding for this \nresearch. H.R. 810 is a bill that has garnered support across the faith \ncommunity and across political lines. I respect those who raise \nconcerns grounded in what they believe are moral and ethical issues \nsurrounding this issue. I would assure them that this bill contains \nprovisions that will ensure donor consent for the use of the embryos \nfor medical research. The bill also maintains that research on these \nstem cells will be conducted in an ethical manner.\n  Those who oppose stem cell research seemingly ignore the fact that \nembryos used for this research will be otherwise discarded. Women at \nfertility clinics are given an option of what to do with unused \nfertilized embryos. At the discretion of the donor, embryos can be \npreserved, donated for medical research, or discarded. In the United \nStates, there are more than 400,000 frozen embryos which are stored for \ninfertile couples, and many ultimately will be thrown away. The options \nof discarding these embryos or allowing them to be used for lifesaving \nresearch would seem to offer a clear choice to those on both sides of \nthis debate.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of S. 471 and I urge the Senate to pass \nthe Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act so we can begin realizing the \npromise of this research.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, of the three bills being discussed, only \none, H.R. 810, the Stem Cell Research Act, contains language which \nwould lead to substantive expansion of stem cell research. The \nlegislation would authorize Federal funding for research on stem cells \nderived from donated embryos. These embryos will likely be destroyed if \nthey are not donated for research. The bill also would institute strong \nethical guidelines for this research.\n  We must pass this legislation so that researchers are able to move \nforward on ethical, Federally funded research projects that develop \nbetter treatments for those suffering from diseases. Human embryonic \nstem cells have such great potential because they have the unique \nability to develop into almost any type of cell or tissue in the body. \nStem cell research holds great promise to develop possible cures or \nimproved treatments for a wide range of diseases, such as diabetes, \ncancer, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, autism, heart disease, spinal \ncord injuries, and many other afflictions. We cannot afford to limit \nresearch that could help improve the lives of so many who currently \nsuffer from diseases which we have limited ability to prevent, treat, \nor cure.\n  If we fail to enact H.R. 810, our researchers are likely to fall \nfurther behind the work being done in other countries. Australia, \nCanada, Finland, France, Japan, Singapore, Sweden, and the United \nKingdom have provided substantial governmental support for stem cell \nresearch.\n  The President's restrictions on stem cell research prevent Federal \nfunds from being used for research on newer, more promising stem cell \nlines. In addition, embryonic stem cell lines now eligible for Federal \nfunding are not genetically diverse enough to realize the full \ntherapeutic potential of this research. The President's stem cell \npolicy prevents researchers from moving ahead on an area of research \nthat is very promising. We need to pass this legislation to help move \nresearch forward that could alleviate the pain and suffering of \nindividuals.\n  The other two bills being debated do not provide much help. I agree \nwith the American Diabetes Association that neither S. 2754 nor S. 3504 \n``would have any real impact on the search for a cure and better \ntreatments with diabetes.'' These two bills are no substitute for H.R. \n810. I am hopeful that we will be able to pass H.R. 810 and ensure that \nit is enacted. I am a proud cosponsor of S. 471, the Senate companion \nlegislation to H.R. 810, which was introduced by my colleagues, Senator \nSpecter and Senator Harkin. We have a responsibility to do all that we \ncan to support this promising research that has the potential to \nimprove the lives of individuals suffering from diseases.\n  On June 21, 2005, I met a young constituent, Dayna Akiu, at a hearing \non juvenile diabetes in our Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. Dayna shared with me her success at overcoming the problems \nassociated with diabetes, which meant a lot to her as an active soccer \nplayer. Dayna wanted me to also know that children have a very \ndifficult time managing their diabetes. For example, checking blood \nsugar and taking insulin shots is hard to do for anyone suffering from \ndiabetes, especially for children. Stem cell research has the potential \nto make life better for Dayna and countless others. Every time I meet \nwith constituents advocating for increased stem cell research, I am \nreminded of the great possibility of improving their lives through this \ninnovative medical research. We must allow this research to move ahead \nto improve the lives of Americans of every age across this country.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the question \ncurrently before the Senate regarding whether to allow Federal funding \nfor embryonic stem cell research.\n  It is clear from the last 2 days of debate in the Senate that people \non both sides of this issue have very strong feelings about their \npositions, and rightly so. This is an extremely important issue that \nraises a whole host of questions to which there are no easy answers.\n  On one hand, we must consider the fundamental question of how to \ntreat potential human life. On the other, we must consider the vast \npotential of a scientific field that could greatly improve millions of \nactual human lives and save millions more. When the stakes are this \nhigh, we are obligated to have an honest, open, and thorough debate.\n  In keeping with the gravity of these questions and the potential \nramifications of how we answer them, I believe\n\n[[Page S7682]]\n\nthat both the Government and the scientific community should address \nthem responsibly.\n  Like millions of other American families, my family has been touched \nby the ache of loss brought about by Alzheimer's disease. My father \ndied of complications only a few years ago. At the end of his life, I \nwanted nothing more than to be able to help ease his suffering. Now, as \nI reflect on that difficult time, I think of the families that are \ncurrently enduring the same pain mine did, and I want to help them.\n  I trust the vast majority of the scientific community that believes \nembryonic stem cell research may hold the key to the cures these \nfamilies are seeking. I also believe that our Government can work to \npromote this science responsibly by paving the way for treatments that \nwill save millions of lives without destroying others.\n  Toward that end, I believe the legislation passed by the House \nrepresents a measured, responsible step toward tapping into the vast \npotential that embryonic stem cell research has with respect to finding \ncures for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes, and a wide range of other \ndevastating diseases.\n  In millions of cases, H.R. 810 could mean the difference between a \nnormal life and one of pain and suffering. In millions of other cases, \nit could mean the difference between life and death. By authorizing \nFederal funding only for research on embryonic stem cells that will \nnever become human life and that are donated willingly, it achieves its \nobjectives without destroying the potential for life.\n  To be sure, support from private funds for this research has been \nwelcome. But it is not enough. I have heard from scores of scientists \nin my home State of Colorado--working in university labs as we speak, \ntrying to find cures for our most devastating diseases--who tell me \nthat the Federal funding H.R. 810 would authorize would boost their \ncapabilities exponentially.\n  In addition to the practical impact on American laboratories, \nhowever, there is something else to consider. I can think of no other \nNation that should lead this research with strict guidelines than the \nUnited States. Throughout our Nation's history, America has been the \nleader in making monumental scientific strides--on everything from cars \nto computers to medicine--that have made life easier and better for \npeople in our country and all over the world. In a field with such \ngreat promise, I believe we owe it to our history and to our position \nin the world community to once again be the leader.\n  I want to be clear that I also believe we should promote research on \nadult umbilical cord stem cells, as well as alternative methods of \ncreating embryonic stem cells. In addition, we should do everything in \nour power to prevent unethical and repulsive practices from pervading \nthis kind of research. For that reason, I strongly support the other \ntwo proposals that are currently before the Senate, S. 2754 and S. \n3504.\n  As I make these remarks today, I think once again of my father. I \nalso think of other fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters across this \ngreat Nation who live every day with debilitating conditions that stem \ncell research could help cure. Suffering that could be stopped. Lives \nthat could be saved. Families that could stay together.\n  We have an opportunity to make great strides on these fronts today \nand to do so responsibly. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 810.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today we must reach across the aisle and \nmake a strong bipartisan statement supporting embryonic stem cell \nresearch and challenge our scientists to use embryonic stem cells to \nsee if the promise of treatments and cures can be made a reality for \nthe many around our country and around the world who look to this \nresearch for hope.\n  The Web site of the National Institutes of Health says it most \nclearly. That Web site states embryonic ``stem cells have potential in \nmany different areas of health and medical research. To start with \nstudying stem cells will help us to understand how they transform into \nthe dazzling array of specialized cells that make us what we are. Some \nof the most serious medical conditions such as cancer and birth defects \nare due to problems that occur somewhere in this process. . . . \nPluripotent stem cells offer the possibility of a renewable source of \nreplacement cells and tissues to treat a myriad of diseases, conditions \nand disabilities including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, spinal \ncord injury, stroke, burns, heart disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis and \nrheumatoid arthritis.''\n  Scientists believe that Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, and spinal \ncord injuries are some of the areas that could be helped through \nembryonic stem cell research. I see no reason embryonic stem cell \nresearch should be treated any differently than other research.\n  Some say embryonic stem cell research has not helped to date. Some \npoint out that there has not been much success in stem cell research \nsince it began in 1998. This kind of research has been only done for \nless than 10 years. That is a nanosecond when it comes to scientific \nresearch. In comparison, Congress passed the National Cancer Act in \n1971. This was legislation to make ``the conquest of cancer a national \ncrusade.'' That legislation greatly accelerated the pace of cancer \nresearch and its translation into treatment. However it was not until \n2005, when cancer deaths in the United States declined for the first \ntime since 1930, when the United States started tracking cancer deaths. \nIn the intervening years treatments evolved to help people fight cancer \nand live longer and better with the disease.\n  Those opposed to this research say that supporters of embryonic stem \ncell research have overpromised the benefits of the research. Without \nexpanding the research beyond the bounds of current policy, people will \nnever know what might have been.\n  California, New Jersey, Illinois, and a few other States have stepped \nup to help fund research, but they should not be expected to carry this \nburden alone. H.R. 810 will give clear the way for researchers to use \nFederal funding to access other cell lines than the 22 currently \napproved lines and provide access to other critical tools needed so \nresearch in this promising new area can be accelerated to the benefit \nof all. I urge support for H.R. 810.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise in support of this long overdue \nlegislation to expand stem cell research.\n  When this issue first came up with President Bush in 2001, he had a \nchoice between helping scientists conduct lifesaving research or \nputting politics before science. To the detriment of the millions of \nAmericans suffering from diseases and conditions for which there is no \ncure, the President chose politics and decided that Federal funds could \nonly be used for research on existing stem cell lines.\n  At the time, there were 78 existing stem cell lines--only 22 of which \nwere usable. Scientists agreed that this was nowhere near enough to \nfulfill the promise that stem cell research provides. To make matters \nworse, scientists at the University of California San Diego and the \nSalk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla conducted an \nextensive study showing that even those lines are contaminated by mouse \nfeeder cells--and unsuitable for human therapies. So the President's \npolicy--painted as a compromise at the time--left scientists with \nlittle to no chance to advance their research.\n  At least 10 countries have made significant financial commitments to \nstem cell research. Our commitment is less than one quarter of \nAustralia's. Our country's failure to lead on this is having \nsignificant consequences. Here is one example:\n  After the President's announcement in 2001, Roger Pedersen, one of \nthe world's leading stem cell researchers, announced that he was \nleaving his faculty position at the University of California San \nFrancisco for one at the University of Cambridge. He saw a promising \nfuture for stem cell research in the United Kingdom, yet saw none in \nthe United States.\n  We need to change this.\n  I am proud to say that California recognized that our Federal policy \nwas unacceptable. The State has enacted the Nation's first law to \npermit research involving human embryonic and adult stem cells while \nfacilitating the voluntary donation of embryos for stem cell research. \nNow how did this happen in California? It started with one man and one \nfamily.\n  Roman Reed was 19 years old when he broke his neck in a college \nfootball game and became paralyzed. Roman's\n\n[[Page S7683]]\n\nparents led a campaign in 2002 to pass legislation to invest in spinal \ncord injury research.\n  Then, in November 2004, Californians passed Proposition 71, which \nprovides $3 billion in State funding over 10 years for embryonic stem \ncell research. Unfortunately for Roman and his family, legal challenges \nhave stalled these funds, and with them, stalled their hope for a \nbrighter future.\n  More States are considering their own initiatives, but these State \nefforts simply can't supplant the resources and expertise that would \nresult from research supported by this administration and the National \nInstitute of Health.\n  Today, after years of struggling to pass this legislation, we have an \nopportunity to offer hope to thousands of Americans and put America \nback on the cutting edge of science. We know we can make a difference \nwhen we give our scientists the tools and support to do their work.\n  Because of our national commitment to scientific achievement and \nthrough NIH-supported research, death rates for heart disease and \nsudden infant death syndrome have been nearly cut in half in the past \nseveral years. The number of AIDS-related deaths fell 70 percent \nbetween 1995 and 2001. HIV/AIDS has become a disease that more people \nlive with and fewer die from. And as a result of critical research at \nthe National Cancer Institute at NIH, the survival rate for children \nwith cancer rose by 80 percent in the 1990s.\n  The current Federal policy has been a roadblock to progress. This \nbill will put us back on the right track. Some in this body have been \ntelling the American public that stem cell research is morally wrong. \nBut we have taken every step to address their concerns in this bill.\n  This legislation would only allow Federal funding of research on stem \ncell lines derived from excess fertilized embryos that were never \nactually used in couples' in vitro fertilization processes. Right now, \nthese embryos are being discarded, and we are losing hundreds or even \nthousands of valuable new stem cell lines.\n  I believe it is wrong to have those embryonic stem cell lines go to \nwaste when we could instead offer hope to Americans suffering from \ndevastating medical conditions. We have a moral imperative to try to \nrelieve their pain.\n  That is why we have seen a broad coalition of people across political \nlines that support this research. One example is former First Lady \nNancy Reagan. She took a stand that was based on compassion and not \npolitics. For many years, she cared for President Reagan. She inspired \nmillions of Americans with her quiet courage and dignity. She knows \nthat this research holds the best hope for the 4.5 million people who, \nlike her late husband, suffer from Alzheimer's. She knows that \nsupporting stem cell research would save many lives.\n  Our beloved Christopher Reeve--who we all know was paralyzed from a \nriding accident--supported and actively campaigned for this research \nbecause he knew that those 250,000 to 400,000 people with spinal cord \ninjuries potentially could be treated.\n  How many of us have ever seen a colleague, friend, or family member \nsuffering from a terrible disease like Parkinson's? Where the sufferers \nand their families struggle with debilitating physical deterioration, \never-changing medications with terrible side effects and the knowledge \nthat the patient's condition will continue to decline--often fatally?\n  How many of us have met with constituents and patient advocate \ngroups--like the ALS Association, the Juvenile Diabetes Research \nFoundation, the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society--that share their stories \nof courage and great hope for the passage of this legislation? Stem \ncell research has the potential for finding cures to diseases like \nParkinson's, ALS, diabetes, and cancer, and has the great potential to \nreduce suffering. We should fulfill that potential and pass this \nimportant legislation now.\n  I hope that Senators support H.R. 810 because we can change the \ncurrent policy and open the door to major advances in medical science \nthrough stem cell research.\n  President Bush has said that he will veto this legislation if it \nreaches his desk. I ask him to reconsider this unwise decision. The \nlives of millions of Americans are in his hands.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, as the Senate debates stem cell research, \nI wanted to indicate that I will be supporting all three measures \nbefore the Senate. I will support these measures because I have great \nfaith that some day this promising research will lead to cures for some \nof our most devastating diseases.\n  This is not a decision I came to hastily. I have thought long and \nhard about stem cell research. Hundreds of North Dakota families have \ntold me this research is the key to helping their loved ones lead \nhealthy lives. I have also heard from North Dakotans who have very \nstrong religious objections to stem cell research. I respect their \nviews. But, in the end, I believe we should put an appropriate ethical \nframework in place to give hope of a cure to those who suffer from \ndisease. That is why I am supporting stem cell research.\n  In 2001, a group of U.S. Senators, including me, called on President \nBush to allow Federal funding of stem cell research. The President \nagreed and created the current policy of allowing research but only on \nthose lines developed by August 9, 2001. This arbitrary date has \nlimited the ability of scientists to fully realize the potential of \nstem cell research. In fact, there are only 22 lines available today, \nand all are contaminated. I think it is right to expand the available \nlines. And it is imperative that we create a strong framework to ensure \nthis research is done in the most ethical way.\n  It has been over a year since the House of Representatives took \naction on H.R. 810, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, and passed \nit with overwhelmingly bipartisan support. This bill expands Federal \nresearch while strengthening the ethical guidelines associated with it. \nTo be clear, this bill would only allow research on stem cells taken \nfrom excess embryos used in fertility treatments. Fertility clinics \nhelp couples have a baby, but sometimes this therapy produces extra \nembryos, which can be disposed of, donated to other couples, or used \nfor research. A 2003 study estimated that 400,000 excess embryos are \ncurrently stored in these clinics and more than 11,000 of those have \nbeen designated for research. This bill simply allows researchers \naccess to those embryos.\n  H.R. 810 also requires that these embryos would never be implanted \ninto a woman and that the individual has given written consent for the \ndonation. Under the current policy, there are no such guidelines. I \nbelieve these requirements are essential to ensuring the strongest \nethical behavior.\n  Before I close, I would like to share the stories of two young girls \nthat I have had the pleasure of meeting. Their stories--as well as the \nthousands of others like them--have deeply impacted my decision to \nsupport H.R. 810. Ashley Dahlen and Camille Johnson are both teenagers \nsuffering with juvenile diabetes. And I truly mean suffering. They each \nhave scars on their fingertips from where they have to check their \nblood sugars constantly, even while they are sleeping. They have to \nstay home from school when their sugars are too high. Both have had \nextremely close calls and have been hospitalized. Without a cure, both \nwill end up on dialysis and will suffer other complications, possibly \neven heart failure.\n  These young girls and their families support stem cell research. They \nwant to grow up, get married, and have children of their own. They \ncontinue to hope that one day, stem cell research will provide them a \ncure to this most awful disease. I share their hope and faith in stem \ncell research. Today, I am voting to pass this hope along to the \nmillions of children and families suffering from diseases that could be \ncured using stem cell research.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today, the Senate is debating H.R. 810, the \nStem Cell Research Enhancement Act, which would allow the Federal \nGovernment to provide additional funding for embryonic stem cell \nresearch. I have received numerous heartfelt letters from constituents \noutlining their concerns with embryonic stem cell research. These are \nconcerns which I simply cannot overlook or dismiss.\n  I know the suffering and worry that families go through when a loved \none desperately needs treatment for a serious progressive illness. \nEasing the pain\n\n[[Page S7684]]\n\nand suffering of our loved ones, our daughters, sons, parents, and \ngrandparents, should be at the hallmark of a caring society. The \npotential of finding cures for Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, \ncancer, and diabetes must not be ignored.\n  I understand the promise for embryonic stem cell research to yield \ntreatments and therapies for numerous diseases; however, we must not \noverlook the ethical concerns associated with such research. I am a \ngreat supporter and will continue to be a proponent of fully funding \nthe Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health \nfor research into cures for cancer, diabetes, and heart disease, to \nname a few, which is why I also support H.R. 810. However, the moral \nimplications of embryonic stem cell research must not be discounted.\n  We are not just debating whether the scientific and medical \ncommunities should continue the exploration of embryonic stem cells \ntheir impact on medical conditions. If Federal funds begin to flow \nwithout also addressing moral issues such as human cloning, how long \nwill it be before an ethical crisis of our own making erupts? This is \nwhy the Congress should also debate a framework to ensure that \npractices such as reproductive cloning do not take place. The Senate \nhas taken up three bills, none of which provides guidance about stem \ncell research's future development. None of these bills addresses the \nneed to examine the possibility that embryonic stem cell research might \nlead to potential immoral outcomes, such as the cloning of human beings \nfor illegitimate purposes. We must not dismiss these ethical and moral \nundertones. A comprehensive approach must be devised to protect science \nand medicine against misuse and public backlash. While I will support \nH.R. 810 in order to help provide hope to those who suffer from \ndiseases, the Congress must take a hard look into ensuring scientific \nintegrity as this medical research proceeds.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the stem cell \nbills currently being considered by the Senate. Frankly, this debate \nhas been too long in coming and I commend my friends, Majority Leader \nFrist and Minority Leader Reid, on coming to an agreement and bringing \nthis debate to the floor.\n  This is as real as it gets. This is about life over death and hope \nover despair. This is about encouraging astounding scientific advances \nthat can relieve the suffering of millions of our fellow citizens, or \naccepting a shriveling stasis that, in fact, sounds a retreat as we \nwatch the rest of the world march past us.\n  We have before us three stem cell bills, but only one, the Stem Cell \nResearch Enhancement Act, H.R. 810, deals with embryonic stem cells.\n  Let me say that with a big ``E.'' These embryonic stem cells actually \nhold the greatest promise for those afflicted with currently incurable \ndiseases such as Alzheimer's, heart failure, and spinal cord injury. \nThese stem cells are pluripotent--that is they can differentiate into \nany and all tissues.\n  There is still much to know about what causes appropriate \ndifferentiation of embryonic stem cells, but if we conduct research to \nanswer these questions, we will have the scientific power to replace \ndead neural tissue and muscle and cancerous white blood cells, with \nfresh new ones.\n  The potential is breathtaking. What this means is that an individual \nwith quadriplegia could walk again. The elderly affected by Alzheimer's \ncan be brought back from a hellish twilight and rejoin their families. \nChildhood leukemia could be banished to the realm of distant memory. \nAnd Americans everywhere will have a second chance at running with \nstrong loud hearts.\n  The science on embryonic stem cells is new and complicated, which is \nwhy we need our Nation's brightest minds working on this. Yet in 2001, \nPresident Bush issued an executive order which effectively banned \nfederally funded embryonic stem cell research. This has stifled our \nNation's attempts to lead the world in harnessing the potential and \nmiracles of embryonic stem cells. The President reasoned, like many who \noppose this bill, that the process of embryonic stem cell extraction \namounts to abortion because these cells have to be taken from \nmicroscopic embryos that do not survive the process.\n  What the President did not mention is that the embryos under \ndiscussion number in the tens of thousands. They are the unused embryos \nfrom in-vitro fertilization, are frozen in fertility clinics, are \nunique, and will be thrown away.\n  I repeat: Thrown away. The chance to offer new life to millions of \nAmericans suffering from debilitating by disease or injury will be \ndiscarded as medical waste.\n  Given these facts, the choice seems clear. The Senate must choose to \nadvance the scope of our scientific knowledge and expand the horizons \nof our medical technologies.\n  The House has already done this. Last year, by a vote of 238 to 194, \nthe House passed H.R. 810, introduced by Representative Michael Castle, \nwhich authorized federally funded research on embryonic stem cell lines \nderived from surplus embryos at in-vitro fertilization clinics, \nprovided that donors give consent and that they are not paid for the \nembryos.\n  The Senate today has the opportunity to join the House and we must do \nso by a resounding majority to convince the President that a veto of \nthe Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act is contrary to what Americans \nwant.\n  More than 65% of Americans support federal funding of embryonic stem \ncell research across all party lines.\n  Finally, I do support the other two pills being considered alongside \nthe Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. But a vote for them without a \nvote for H.R. 810 is the height of cynicism.\n  Let us be clear, alternatives to embryonic stem cells, such as \numbilical cord and adult bone marrow stem cells, are inferior \nalternatives. They do not have the same regenerative potential and \nCongress has already authorized money that is currently being used for \nresearch in this area.\n  Today we stand at destiny's doorstep with the chance to have it swing \nwide and open into a new age of scientific and medical understanding. \nWe must not hesitate.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in passage of H.R. 810 and I call on \nPresident Bush to sign it into law and not veto the hopes and dreams of \nmillions of Americans for whom astounding new cures may lie just over \nthe threshold of our present knowledge.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has until 3:15. I think \nit is about 8 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Eight minutes? Then I yield myself 8 minutes, I guess.\n  First of all, Mr. President, I thank all the Senators who came here \nto speak in support of H.R. 810, Republicans, Democrats, liberals, \nconservatives, moderates. I think it has been a very good debate.\n  When I started the debate, I talked about hope. Senator Feinstein \nspoke about that. Senator Kennedy just spoke eloquently about hope. I \nthink that is where we should close the debate, on hope, because H.R. \n810 offers real hope. It offers real hope to people who are suffering \nfrom Alzheimer's, from ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease, Parkinson's, spinal \ncord injuries, juvenile diabetes. It offers hope to their loved ones \nand their families.\n  Senator Kennedy just read the statement by Lauren Stanford about her \nhope, her hope that she can one day be whole again. To repeat for \nemphasis sake what Senator Kennedy just said, Lauren Stanford--she is \ninnocent, as she said. She did nothing to bring on her diabetes. As she \nsaid, all I have is hope.\n\n       I am so happy to hear that the Senate is thinking of \n     passing H.R. 810. I can dream again.\n       The one thing that has helped me accept what I have had to \n     all these years is the presence of hope. Hope keeps me going.\n\n  That is Lauren Stanford. ``Hope keeps me going.''\n  H.R. 810 basically opens the door and lets in the sunshine. It opens \nthe door for more responsible research, research done with good peer \nreview, research done with good oversight, and, I might add, research \ndone with strong ethical guidelines that we have in H.R. 810.\n  I remind my colleagues and all who are watching, the ethical \nguidelines in H.R. 810 are stronger than what exists\n\n[[Page S7685]]\n\nright now--stronger than what exists right now.\n  The American people get it. They understand this. We know in a recent \npoll that asked, ``Do you support embryonic stem cell research?'' that \n72 percent said ``Yes.'' That is almost three out of four. Most of \nthese American people who support stem cell research don't have MDs. \nThey don't have a Ph.D. But they know one thing: virtually every \nreputable biomedical scientist, almost all Nobel Prize winners, say \nthat embryonic stem cell research holds enormous potential to cure \ndiseases and injuries. They know that.\n  That is why 591 groups, disease advocacy groups, patient groups, \nscientific groups, research institutions, religious groups--591 \nAmerican organizations support H.R. 810. That is why over 80 Nobel \nPrize winners have written to us asking us to pass H.R. 810. The \nAmerican people get it. They know what is at stake.\n  As I said, it has been a good debate. I thank Senator Frist, our \nmajority leader, for engineering this debate and making it possible for \nus to have an up-or-down vote on H.R. 810. But I must say, in the last \ncouple of days, what has saddened me is that so much time has been \nspent talking about whether adult stem cells or embryonic stem cell \nresearch is the way to go. Frankly, the vast majority of American \npeople could care less. They could care less. They want cures. They \nwant cures for Parkinson's and Alzheimer's and juvenile diabetes and \nspinal cord injuries. They want their loved ones to have a better life, \na fuller life, a pain-free life--less suffering.\n  If adult stem cells get us there, fine. If embryonic stem cell \nresearch gets us there, fine. We should not shut the door; we want to \nopen the doors. We have done 30 years of work on adult stem cell \nresearch and not one of these illnesses has yet been cured or even \nremotely cured by adult stem cells. We have only had embryonic stem \ncells for 8 years, but we ought to open the doors.\n  It is a false dichotomy to say that it is either adult stem cells or \nembryonic stem cells. As Senator Smith of Oregon said today so \neloquently, the people of America want these embryos that are left over \nfrom IVF clinics not to be discarded but to give the gift of life to \nthose who suffer.\n  Last night when I left the floor of the Senate, I met a young man out \nhere, the first time I ever met him. His name is Jeff McGaffrey. He is \nsitting here on the floor of the Senate today. I didn't know this: he \nis an intern on the HELP Committee. He was appointed to the U.S. Air \nForce Academy in Missouri, and during his first year there he suffered \nan accident and now doesn't have the use of his legs. He is paralyzed \nfrom the waist down.\n  I want to read this. This is a letter from Jeff McGaffrey.\n\n       Honest to God, not a day goes by, not an hour goes by when \n     I don't think about my days at the academy, about the life I \n     led as an officer in the Armed Forces, leading soldiers in \n     service to our nation. In spite of this chair that I am \n     confined to, I still regard myself as an officer, a soldier \n     on the frontlines of a different type of battlefield; a \n     battle not against a country or an army, but against disease \n     and injury.\n       I continue to cherish the hope for a cure, until the day \n     comes, if God-willing, I can walk away from this chair and \n     back into the camaraderie and respect of the men and women \n     who proudly serve our country in the Armed Forces.\n       I ask that you please keep my hope alive, and not just my \n     hope but the hopes of millions of people, including our \n     soldiers and veterans who proudly served our country and who \n     currently suffer from disease and injury.\n\n  Keeping this hope alive is made possible by moving forward with stem \ncell research, especially H.R. 810, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement \nAct. We know not where embryonic stem research might lead, but we know \nthere is only one way to find out, by allowing NIH funding for our best \nand brightest scientists to explore the full therapeutic potential of \nembryonic stem cells.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Jeff McGaffrey's letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Dear Senator Harkin: My name is Jeff McCaffrey, and I had \n     the wonderful privilege of meeting you last night at the end \n     of the stem cell debate. As you could tell, I was confined to \n     a wheelchair. I currently suffer from paralysis due to a \n     spinal cord injury. I am a resident of the great state of \n     Missouri, currently interning for the Senate HELP Committee \n     through Chairman Enzi working on the health policy team. I'm \n     also a student at the University of Missouri-Kansas City.\n       I have not always been a student at the University of \n     Missouri-Kansas City, nor have I always been confined to a \n     wheelchair. I was appointed to the U.S. Air Force Academy \n     following high school. It was an honor that I continue to be \n     proud of. Unfortunately I suffered a spinal cord injury while \n     I was there. I believe one of the greatest honors and \n     responsibilities that an individual can have is being an \n     officer in the armed forces, leading soldiers in service to \n     our nation. This was, and still is, my goal, my ambition, one \n     in which I would dedicate my life to.\n       Honest to God, not a day goes by, not an hour goes by when \n     I don't think about my days at the academy, about the life I \n     would have lead as an officer in the armed forces, leading \n     soldiers in service to our nation. In spite of this chair \n     that I am confined to, I still regard myself as an officer, a \n     soldier on the frontlines of a different type of battlefield; \n     a battle not against a country or army, but against disease \n     and injury.\n       I continue to cherish the hope for a cure, until the day \n     comes, if God-willing, I can walk away from this chair and \n     back into the camaraderie and respect of the men and women \n     who proudly serve our country in the armed forces.\n       I ask that you please keep my hope alive, and not just my \n     hope, but the hope of millions of people, including our \n     soldiers and veterans who proudly served our country and who \n     currently suffer from disease and injury. Keeping this hope \n     alive is made possible by moving forward with stem cell \n     research, especially H.R. 810, The Stem-Cell Research \n     Enhancement Act. We know not where embryonic stem cell \n     research might lead, but we know there is only one way to \n     find out, by allowing NIH funding for our best and brightest \n     scientists to explore the full therapeutic potential of \n     embryonic stem cells.\n       Whether cures are found, whether my dream becomes a reality \n     or not, I hope my service, in whatever capacity it might be, \n     can lay the foundation for a better world, which is exactly \n     what the brave men and women who serve our country do \n     everyday.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                    Jeff McCaffrey\n                                      Former U.S. Air Force Cadet.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I close with this thought. So many people \nare suffering in our country. They have hope.\n  My nephew Kelly was injured 27 years ago serving his country--just \nlike Jeff McGaffrey--on an aircraft carrier in the Pacific. He was \nsucked down by a jet engine and broke his neck. He has been paralyzed \nfor 27 years. He keeps his hope alive. He has followed this debate. He \nhas followed years of research. Kelly McGuade is a smart young man. He \nhas followed it, and he knows that the one thing which gives him the \nbest hope is embryonic stem cell research.\n  Are we today going to dash their hopes? Are we going to shut the \ndoor, pull the curtain down, and say, I am sorry? What all the major \nscientists with the best minds say is the best potential--are we going \nto close the curtain and shut the door?\n  I say open the door. Bring in the sunshine. Let our scientists move \nahead with the strong ethical guidelines, with good peer review and \nwith good oversight to give hope to my nephew, to Jeff, and to millions \nof Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, embryonic stem cell research has \nenormous promise for lifesaving treatments that may help cure juvenile \ndiabetes, Parkinson's, spinal injury, and other debilitating diseases. \nThat is why I will vote today for the House-passed legislation that \nallows Federal funding of research on stem cells derived from excess \nembryos at fertility clinics that would otherwise be discarded.\n  President Bush has already said that Federal funds may be used in \nsome cases for research on some stem cell lines derived from fertilized \neggs. This bill will increase the number of stem cell lines available \nfor research.\n  With the help of fertility clinics, some perspective parents use \nfertilized eggs to help them have children. The excess eggs that these \nparents don't use often are thrown away. I support using some of these \nfertilized eggs under carefully controlled conditions with the consent \nof the donors for potentially lifesaving research.\n  I will also vote for two other bills this afternoon. The first bill \nencourages stem cell research that does not involve the destruction of \nembryos, and the second bill bans fetal farming--the practice of \ncreating fetuses solely for research purposes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will vote in support of all three bills \nunder\n\n[[Page S7686]]\n\nconsideration today, which together provide a framework for addressing \nthe issue of stem cell research. This research holds the potential to \nunlock cures that could defeat deadly diseases and relieve tremendous \nhuman suffering. At the same time, one type of stem cell research, \ninvolving embryonic stem cells, has also raised serious ethical and \nmoral concerns, both inside and outside the medical community. I \nbelieve the framework provided by the three bills before us today \noffers a way forward.\n  S. 2754 offers increased Federal funding and support for adult stem \ncell research and other types of stem cell research that do not involve \nthe use of human embryos. Scientists believe this research holds \ntremendous potential, and I share their hope. Countless numbers are \naffected by the many diseases that this type of research may offer \nfuture cures.\n  In promoting stem cell research, one of the lines that must not be \ncrossed is the intentional creation of human embryos for purposes of \nresearch rather than reproduction. A second bill before us, S. 3504, \ndraws a line that says we in the United States will not abandon our \nvalues in pursuit of scientific progress. This bill bans the practice \nof what has been referred to as ``fetal farming.'' It makes it a \nFederal crime for researchers to use cells or fetal tissue from an \nembryo that was created for research purposes. This bill also makes it \na Federal crime to attempt to use or obtain cells from a human fetus \nthat was gestated in the uterus of a nonhuman animal. These provisions \nclose important gaps in our existing laws, and I urge my fellow \nSenators to join me in supporting this bill.\n  It is important that we act now to address these issues because \nresearch involving embryonic stem cells is also proceeding outside the \nUnited States. Unfortunately, the intense focus on ethical and moral \nconcerns that has driven the debate in America, as reflected in the \nPresident's Commission on Bioethics, is not always present in private \nindustry and the scientific community in other parts of the world. I am \nconcerned about the path that some of this unregulated research leads \nus down. Of particular concern is the potential for experimentation \ninto human cloning. Our involvement through this legislation is another \nprotection against sanctioning such practice within our own borders. I \nam concerned that ongoing research elsewhere may result in the routine \nacceptance of deeply troubling practices, in particular the intentional \ncreation of human embryos for purposes of research rather than \nreproduction.\n  However, it doesn't have to be this way. The United States offers a \nclimate for scientific and medical research because of the quality of \nour educational institutions, the strength of our economy, and the \nscope of our comprehensive legal and regulatory system for protection \nof intellectual property rights. The final bill before us, H.R. 810, \nwill allow us to attract scientists to perform highly regulated \nembryonic stem cell research that will otherwise take place in an \nunregulated environment somewhere else. This bill authorizes Federal \nsupport for embryonic stem cell research but limits that support to \nscientists who use embryos originally created for reproductive \npurposes, and now frozen or slated for destruction by in vitro \nfertilization clinics. H.R. 810 requires that prior to even considering \nwhether to donate unused embryos for research, the patient who is the \nsource of the embryos must be consulted, and a determination must be \nmade that these embryos would otherwise be discarded and would never be \nimplanted in the patient or another woman. This provision ensures that \npatients with excess embryos will first consider the possibility of \nembryo adoption, and only if this option is rejected will the patient \nthen be consulted concerning the possibility of embryo donation. A \npatient donating embryos that would otherwise remain frozen or be \ndestroyed must give written informed consent, and H.R. 810 makes it \nillegal for anyone to offer any sort of financial or other inducement \nin exchange for this consent.\n  All of these carefully drawn rules contained in H.R. 810 do not exist \nin the status quo, and this sort of embryonic stem cell research \nremains largely unregulated in the private sector and in many parts of \nthe scientific community overseas. Federal oversight that will come \nwith approving this bill will allow us to ensure that this research \ndoes not expand into ethically objectionable ground in balancing the \npromise on the foreseeable horizon of stem cell research with the \nprotection of human life. It should be clearly noted that this type of \nresearch will proceed with or without Federal approval, so I believe \nthat it is best carried out under strict Federal guidelines and \noversight. It is my hope that by offering limited Federal support in \nthe context of the framework provided by the three bills before us \ntoday, we can realize the benefits of stem cell research while also \ndrawing clear lines that reflect our refusal to sacrifice our ethical \nand moral values for the sake of scientific progress.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, stem cell research has brought to the \nforefront the longstanding debate between bioethics and advancements in \nmedical science. Stem cell research evokes hope in scientific progress \nwhile at the same time reminding us of its ethical hazards. \nUnquestionably, this is one of the most difficult public policy issues \nthe Senate has discussed in many years.\n  I wish to make it very clear that I do not oppose stem cell research. \nI support and encourage research that uses cells derived from adult \ntissues and umbilical-cord blood and hope that an alternative source of \nembryonic stem cells, one that does not destroy embryos, can be found. \nI believe that it is possible to advance scientific research without \nviolating ethical principles. It is my intention to support the \nAlternative Pluripotent Stem Cell Therapies Enhancement Act, S. 2754, \nwhich will support the use and further development of techniques for \nproducing pluripotent cells like those derived from embryos but without \nharming or destroying human life.\n  After much reflection on this issue, I have determined that I \npersonally cannot support H.R. 810, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement \nAct. Taking stem cells from an embryo kills that embryo, and destroying \nhuman life is never justified even if it is done in order to benefit \nothers. Obtaining good for oneself at the cost of another is contrary \nto my deepest held moral beliefs.\n  I do not believe the American public should have to fund research \nthat many find morally objectionable. The future of this research does \nnot require a policy of Federal funding. There is no ban on private \nfunding of embryonic stem cell research, and there are other resources \navailable to fund this type of research. The State of California has \neven chosen to use State taxpayer funds for embryonic stem cell \nresearch.\n  It is also my intent to support S. 3504, the Fetus Farming \nProhibition bill. This bill would make it illegal to perform research \non embryos from ``fetal farms,'' where human embryos could be gestated \nin a nonhuman uterus or from human pregnancies created specifically for \nthe purpose of research.\n  Although it is often portrayed as such, the debate over embryonic \nstem cell research is not easily reduced to simple positions in support \nor opposition. Good people can and do disagree on this very complex \nissue. It is my belief that by pursuing the appropriate scientific \ntechniques we can alleviate human suffering and also preserve the \nsanctity of human life, and it is for these reasons that I cast my vote \ntoday.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I wish to address some of the comments \nmade by my colleagues, Senators Brownback and Coburn, during the debate \nregarding H.R. 810.\n  Senator Coburn stated that ``every disease Senator Harkin listed--\nevery disease save ALS--has an adult stem cell or cord blood stem cell \ncure that has already been proven in humans, without using embryonic \nstem cells.'' Senator Harkin listed the following diseases and \ninjuries: cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disease, Alzheimer's, \nParkinson's, spinal cord injuries, birth defects, and severe burns. My \nresponse to Senator Coburn is where are these cures of which he speaks? \nCardiovascular disease remains the No. 1 killer of Americans. \nAutoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis and lupus confound family \nmembers of Senators in this Chamber. Nancy Reagan would likely have \nheard of a cure for Alzheimer's disease. Christopher Reeve recently \npassed away and\n\n[[Page S7687]]\n\nhis spinal cord injury was not healed by adult or cord blood stem \ncells. To say that ``proven cures'' exist is to defy the experience and \ninsult the intelligence of millions of Americans.\n  Senator Coburn stated that we are telling the American people that \nthere are ``no cures other than fetal stem cell research . . . the fact \nis there is not one cure in this country today from embryonic stem \ncells.'' First, I have always supported all forms of medical research. \nMy goal is to attain cures and treatments for diseases by whatever \ntechnology works. If there were restrictions on adult stem cells, I \nwould be the first to introduce legislation to eliminate those \nrestrictions. The fact is, there are no restrictions on Federal funding \nfor adult stem cell research, and there are severe limitations on \nFederal funding for embryonic stem cells.\n  Now, to the point on there being no cures from embryonic stem cells: \nThat is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Human embryonic stem cells were \ndiscovered in 1998. Since that time, there have been severe limitations \non the funding for basic research into how to make proper use of these \nincredible cells. Perhaps, if we had not had any restrictions, there \nwould now be cures available. When I say that ``embryonic stem cells \nhold great promise for treating, curing and improving our understanding \nof diseases'' like diabetes, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral \nsclerosis, and heart disease, I am quoting Dr. Elias Zerhouni, \nPresident Bush's appointee as head of the National Institutes of \nHealth, NIH. When I say that ``human stem cell research represents one \nof the most exciting opportunities in biomedical research,'' I am \nquoting Dr. David Schwartz, the Director of the National Institute on \nEnvironmental Health Sciences and 18 other Directors of the NIH. These \nare the leaders of the biomedical research enterprise in the United \nStates and the world.\n  Senator Coburn stated, that ``as a matter of fact, [these stem cell \nlines] are not contaminated.'' I can only respond by telling you that \nDr. James Battey, the Chairman of the NIH Stem Cell Task Force--and the \nman in charge of keeping track of the 21 approved lines--says ``All of \nthe 21 human embryonic stem cell lines eligible for Federal funding \nhave been exposed to mouse cells.'' It is unlikely these cells will \never be useful for the clinical applications and cures that everyone \nwants.\n  Senator Coburn stated that ``there is no limitation in this country \nat all on private research.'' I do not agree with that statement. \nPrivately funded research in the United States counts on scientists and \ndoctors trained by the NIH. The chokehold on Federal funding has kept \nyoung scientists from entering the field of stem cell research and \nlimited the number and quality of scientists who can do the work that \nprivate investors would like to see done. In addition, when it comes to \nthe basic research that is a necessary first step in curing diseases, \nprivate funds are no match for the almost $30 billion investment we \nmake at the NIH.\n  Senator Brownback notes that this is a question of when life begins. \nI say this is a question of when life ends. These embryos are already \nslated to be thrown away. The decision the Senate faces is do we throw \nthese cells away or do we use them to treat diseases that affect over \n100 million Americans. This is most definitely a question of when life \nends.\n  Senator Brownback has introduced into the record a list of 72 Current \nHuman Clinical Applications Using Adult Stem Cells. That list includes \nlupus, multiple sclerosis, testicular cancer, and Hodgkin's lymphoma. I \nwas surprised to find Hodgkin's lymphoma on this list as I have some \npersonal experience with that disease. My physician, Dr. John Glick, a \nrecognized expert in the field of Hodgkin's lymphoma, stated that he \nhad never heard of such a treatment or cure. I wish that I had known \nthat a ``cure'' existed for this disease when I was undergoing \nchemotherapy, as I would have liked to have avoided some of the \nunpleasant side effects. I state this to illustrate the point that the \ndiseases on that list are diseases for which adult stem cell therapies \nhave been attempted. In most cases, it just means that doctors tried a \nbone marrow transplant. There is no doubt that bone marrow transplants \nare a miraculous treatment, however, they have only been proven to be \nhelpful in blood diseases and enhancing immune systems. The great \npromise of embryonic stem cells is to expand the group of diseases that \ncan be cured to include motor-neuron, cancer, and cardiovascular \ndiseases. This is the great potential that makes patients, like me so \nexcited.\n  My goal is to enable our scientists and doctors to discover cures \nthat will end the suffering of millions of Americans. Passing H.R. 810 \nwill enable scientists to include stem cell research in their search \nfor cures.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I support passage of H.R. 810, the Stem Cell Research \nEnhancement Act of 2005.\n  Research using embryonic stem cells will likely play an important \nrole in developing treatments and cures for conditions such as \ndiabetes, heart disease, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, cancer, and other \ndevastating diseases.\n  With the appropriate safeguards in place over the use of stem cell \ntissues, the potential improvements to our quality of life and our \nstandards of care should be pursued.\n  It is clear from my conversations with scientists representing many \ndisciplines that the stem cell lines permitted under the \nadministration's policy allowing Federal funding from embryonic stem \ncell research on those cell lines in existence on August 9, 2001, are \nno longer adequate to allow them to pursue the breakthroughs in \ntreatments and cures which stem cell research promises.\n\n  This bill does not allow embryos to be created for use in research; \nrather, it allows scientists to use embryos that already exist in \nstorage at fertility clinics that would otherwise be destroyed.\n  It does not make sense to me to discard embryos that might otherwise \nbe used to find a cure for cancer, diabetes, or Alzheimer's because it \nis ``taking a life.'' These embryos are slated for destruction in any \ncase. None of the bills before us today would prohibit the destruction \nof unwanted embryos created in fertility clinics but then unused.\n  I hope that my colleagues would prefer to have this research \nconducted in our country where appropriate safeguards to prevent \ncloning of human beings may be put into place. If Federal funds cannot \nbe used for this research in our own country, scientists will find ways \nto conduct this research in other countries where such safeguards may \nnot be in place, and where Americans might not reap the benefits of the \nresearch.\n  We must provide the means for science to move forward to cure and \ntreat diseases that plague our people. I urge my colleagues to support \nH.R. 810.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, earlier this year I came to the Senate \nfloor in opposition to human cloning and in support of new stem cell \nalternatives that could allow us to get exactly the stem cells we want \nto relieve human suffering without creating, destroying, or cloning a \nhuman embryo. I said during that speech that it appears that the very \nadvances of science that have caused the ethical dilemmas in this area \nof stem cell research may now be providing a solution.\n  The alternatives bill, S. 2754, seeks a genuine way forward that all \nAmericans can wholeheartedly endorse.\n  One year ago, the President's Council on Bioethics issued a report \nentitled ``Alternative Sources of Human Pluripotent Stem Cells.'' This \nreport outlined four proposals for obtaining pluripotent stem cells--\nthose with the same properties and potentials as embryonic stem cells--\nusing techniques that do not involve the destruction of human embryos. \nIn the year since that report, major advances in each of these \napproaches have been documented in peer-reviewed research articles \npublished in leading scientific journals.\n  Two of these ``alternative methods'' offer the possibility of \nobtaining superior stem cells with potential scientific and medical \nadvantages over those that could be obtained by destroying embryos.\n  Altered nuclear transfer and direct reprogramming would permit the \nproduction of pluripotent stem cell lines of specific genetic types. \nThis would allow standardized scientific studies of genetic diseases \nand possibly patient-specific or immune-compatible cell therapies.\n\n[[Page S7688]]\n\n  So it is important to recognize that this alternatives bill, S. 2754, \ncould encourage advances in stem cell biology unlike any current law or \npending legislative approach. And it could do so in a way that would \nsustain moral and social consensus for full Federal funding of this \nresearch. I note that the bill will pass with an overwhelming vote--\nexactly the kind of consensus which I hoped for.\n  For all of these reasons, I will vote enthusiastically for the \nalternatives bill. I will oppose H.R. 810, which uses tax dollars to \nfund research that requires the destruction of human life at its \nearliest stages. The Federal Government has never funded such research \nbefore, and that is not a line I wish to cross--especially since, as \nthe alternatives bill shows, it is possible to fund every type of stem \ncell research without cloning or destroying human embryos. In fact, the \nstem cells which the alternatives can provide are superior--because \nthey are ``patient specific'' genetically--to the stem cells which \nscience can get from destroying embryos.\n  I should add that the promise of the alternatives is speculative, but \nso is the promise of the research which would destroy human life. All \nof this research has potential, it is all speculative, and it all \ninvolves essentially the same science. My sense is that either all of \nit or none of it will prove to be possible and that the right balance \nis therefore to seek the win-win solution that gives us the best chance \nto relieve human suffering while protecting human life.\n  We are entering a promising new era in biomedical technology, but as \nour power over human life increases, so does the seriousness of the \nmoral issues. We should all want to advance biomedical science while \nsustaining fundamental principles for the protection of human life. \nThis is why I am also voting in favor of the prohibition against fetus \nfarms.\n  Biomedical science should be a matter of unity in our national \nidentity: No one should enter the hospital with moral qualms about the \nresearch on which their therapies had been developed or resentful that \npositive possibilities for the best therapies were not explored.\n  The differences within our Nation can be a source of strength as we \nseek to open a way forward for biomedical science. The alternatives \noffer us just such a path to progress.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that I have 15 \nminutes. Am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for those of us who are fortunate to \nrepresent our States in the Senate, it is a high honor and a privilege, \nbut we tend to not understand sometimes the eyes that are watching what \nwe do. Today, the eyes of millions of people are watching us to see \nwhat is going to happen in the Senate as it relates to H.R. 810. Many \nof these people, who are afflicted with dread diseases, having had \nperhaps serious accidents, are personally concerned about what we do \nhere today. But in addition to those people who are personally \nconcerned as a result of the maladies that afflict them, there are \nmillions of us--fathers, mothers, sons, daughters, aunts, uncles, \nneighbors, friends, brothers, sisters--who are all also watching and \nhoping that their loved ones someday will be better.\n  What is hope? What do you say about hope? If you had to put the words \nin a dictionary for hope, what would you say? I looked in the \ndictionary under ``hope.'' There is a very simple definition: to \ncherish the desire with anticipation. That is what this is all about: \npeople who cherish, desire, and anticipate that we will do something to \nmake their lives better.\n  Shortly here in the Senate we are going to vote on a measure that \nwill allow those people to have hope. It is called the Stem Cell \nResearch Enhancement Act, a piece of legislation that keeps hope alive \nfor millions and millions of people in America--hope for a 17-year-old, \nalmost 18-year-old, Molly Miller. I have followed her disease since she \nwas a little girl. She is a twin. The sister Jacki and herself as twins \ntended to go every place together. One is sick, one isn't. One feels \nthe pain personally, one feels the pain emotionally.\n  This legislation gives hope to Molly and Jacki Miller of Las Vegas, a \npair, a team, twins, who suffer from juvenile diabetes.\n  What is a twin? I guess the best way to describe a twin is when I was \nflying to Las Vegas on a very crowded airplane, I was in one seat and \nthere were two little girls in the middle seat and the window seat. I \nbegan to sit down. I looked at the girls. They looked alike. I said, \nAre you sisters? One girl looked at me very directly and said to me, \nNo, we are twins.\n  Jacki and Molly have suffered and suffered together because they are \nmore than sisters, they are twins.\n  This legislation will give hope to a man by the name of Robert \nAlfertelle of Boulder City, NV. He is confined to a wheelchair because \nof Parkinson's disease.\n  We all know friends and neighbors who have diseases who have hope of \nbeing cured as a result of what we are doing here on the Senate floor \ntoday. These diseases can be cured. We are told they can be cured.\n  You have heard the recitation of these difficult diseases that people \nhave with the hope that they can be cured if we do the right thing here \ntoday. For too long these good people have been denied hope because we \nin the Senate haven't acted. The House passed this bill 14 months ago. \nUnfortunately, until today it has been stalled here in the Senate.\n  The Americans who would benefit from cures offered by stem cell \nresearch have been forced to wait. They have waited through weeks \ndedicated to issues such as the definition of marriage. They waited \nthrough weeks of ideological debate dedicated to the well-off, \nconnected few. In fact, we spent weeks here on issues that would affect \nless than .02 percent of Americans to repeal the estate tax. We spent \ntime here on flag burning. We have waited through a health care week \nthat had nothing to do with getting America help. We have all waited \ntoo long--so long in fact that on May 1 former First Lady Nancy Reagan \nwas so baffled and disappointed by the continued delays in the Senate \nshe wrote a letter, which I quote:\n\n       For those who are waiting every day for scientific progress \n     to help their loved ones, the wait for United States Senate \n     action has been very difficult and very hard to understand.\n\n  I too am disappointed that we have had to wait 14 months for this \nvote. I am grateful the wait is over. I believe that because of the \npersistence of Democrats in the Senate, we will thankfully finally vote \non the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, H.R. 810. This legislation \nprovides a rare opportunity for this Congress--some say this ``do-\nnothing Congress''--to consider legislation about curing disease and \nsaving lives, not partisan politics.\n  This body needs to pass this legislation because the President's \ncurrent stem cell policy is hindering promising medical research that \ncould lead to treatment and cure for diseases and conditions. Under the \nPresident's stem cell policy, Federal research funds can be used on \nonly a small number of chronic stem cell lines, most of which \nare contaminated, and that were created before August 9, 5 years ago.\n\n  Under this policy, only 21 stem cells qualify, many of which are \ncontaminated and are certainly inferior to new and more promising stem \ncell lines. I have heard people come to this floor and say why should \nthe Federal Government get involved? We are spending $3 billion a week \nin Iraq. I think we can get involved. We have gotten involved in a lot \nof things dealing with medical research, as well we should.\n  We have worked for years spending Federal taxpayer dollars on doing \nsomething about AIDS research. Last week it was announced that instead \nof having to take as many as 36 pills a day, there is now one pill for \npeople who are HIV infected--one pill that does the same as 36 pills \ndid, and in fact probably better. People have had to get up in the \nmiddle of the night to take medications.\n  All of that research is funded by the Federal Government. New drugs \nfor epilepsy were started by Tony Coelho who was a whip in the House, \nand who was an epileptic. He led the charge. We spent lots of Federal \ndollars on epilepsy, and we have made great progress.\n  Gene therapy involved the fragile X syndrome. We spent millions of \nFederal\n\n[[Page S7689]]\n\ndollars on stroke prevention, screening for Downs syndrome. We have \nspent hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars on cancer research, \non digestive bowel disease, lupus, and diabetes.\n  These are dollars well spent. We have made progress. But the most \neminent scientists in the world tell us that they need this legislation \npassed. Our Government is needlessly impeding the work of our Nation's \ntop scientists who cannot use Federal funds on research, on new and \nmore promising stem cell research that does not pose the risk of \ncontamination that the eligible stem lines do.\n  This legislation would solve this problem by expanding the number of \nhuman embryonic stem cell lines eligible for federally funded research \nto include new stem cell lines that would be derived from any of the \nmore than 400,000 surplus embryos from fertility clinics that will \nnever be used to create a pregnancy and would otherwise be thrown in \nthe trash.\n  Just as important, this legislation would ensure that stem cell \nresearch is conducted under ethical guidelines that are more strict \nthan the President's current policy.\n  In short, this legislation would allow our Government to do \neverything it can under strict ethical guidelines and oversight to \ndevelop treatments for a wide range of diseases and conditions.\n  That is why this legislation is supported by 41 Nobel laureates, \nvirtually every major medical, scientific, and professional \nassociation, major research universities, and patient advocacy \norganizations.\n  Before we vote on the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, the Senate \nwill first consider two other measures. Neither one of these measures \nis a substitute for H.R. 810. The only reason they are here is to \nprovide political cover for the political opponents of this \nlegislation. The opposition knows that their opposition to stem cell \nresearch is outside the American mainstream, so they want to give \nthemselves political cover by voting for two meaningless bills. It is \nplaybook straight from the Republican Orwellian world of politics. \nNeither one of these bills would do any harm but neither would have any \nimpact at all. There is nothing included in S. 2754 which cannot \nalready be accomplished without this legislation. The National \nInstitutes of Health Director has told the Judiciary Committee this \nexact thing. It doesn't do anything that can't be done now.\n\n  The second bill, the Fetus Farming Prohibition Act, bans activity \nthat no scientist is currently doing or wants to do. I will vote for \nboth of them. They are meaningless.\n  While I support all three of these bills, there is only one that \nmatters, H.R. 810, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act which will \nclear the way for research that can lead the way for treatments and \ncures for a wide range of diseases and conditions.\n  Don't take just my word for it. Hundreds of patient advocacy groups, \nhealth organizations, research universities, scientific societies, \nreligious groups, and other interested organizations, representing \nmillions and millions of patients, scientists, health care providers \nand advocates, wrote the following in a letter to the Senate:\n\n       Of the bills being considered simultaneously, only H.R. 810 \n     will move stem cell research forward in our country . . . The \n     other two bills . . . are not substitutes for a yes vote on \n     H.R. 810.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the full text of this letter, dated July 14, \n2006, signed by almost 600 organizations, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 14, 2006.\n       Dear Senator: We, the undersigned patient advocacy groups, \n     health organizations, research universities, scientific \n     societies, religious groups and other interested institutions \n     and associations, representing millions of patients, \n     scientists, health care providers and advocates, write you \n     with our strong and unified support for H.R. 810, the Stem \n     Cell Research Enhancement Act. We urge your vote in favor of \n     H.R. 810 when the Senate considers the measure next week.\n       Of the bills being considered simultaneously, only H.R. 810 \n     will move stem cell research forward in our country. This is \n     the bill which holds promise for expanding medical \n     breakthroughs. The other two bills--the Alternative \n     Pluripotent Stem Cell Therapies Enhancement Act (S. 2754) and \n     the Fetus Farming Prohibition Act (S. 3504)--are not \n     substitutes for a yes vote on H.R. 810,\n       H.R. 810 is the pro-patient and pro-research bill. A vote \n     in support of H.R. 810 will be considered a vote in support \n     of more than 100 million patients in the U.S. and substantial \n     progress for research. Please work to pass H.R. 810 \n     immediately.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, America needs a new direction not only in \nwhat is going on in Iraq but what is going on with medical research. We \nwill take a step in that direction by passing H.R. 810.\n  A vote against H.R. 810, regardless of how Members vote on the other \ntwo measures, is a vote against research and cures. A vote for it is a \nvote for millions of Americans who are looking to us right new for \nhelp. A vote for H.R. 810 is a vote to keep hope alive. Let's keep hope \nalive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I understand I have 15 minutes under my \ncontrol.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is correct.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes on my time to Senator \nDodd, who has been unable to come to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the majority leader immensely for his generosity. I \nknow we are about to close out this debate, and I am appreciative of \nhim allowing me this time to express my strong support for this \nlegislation. I commend the majority leader, along with my colleagues \nfrom Pennsylvania and Iowa, Senator Specter and Senator Harkin, and \nothers who have championed this issue. I commend the other body for \npassing this legislation, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, over \na year ago and by a fairly substantial majority vote.\n  My hope is that my colleagues, in a significant vote, will endorse \nand support what has already been done in the House. Then we can \nfinally deliver on promising stem cell research that may one day \nprovide relief to the more than 100 million Americans suffering from \nParkinson's, diabetes, spinal cord injury, ALS, cancer, and many other \ndevastating conditions for which there is still no cure.\n  This is controversial, there is no question about it. But as the \ndistinguished minority leader, the Democratic leader, pointed out, we \nare talking about embryos that would otherwise be discarded but can now \nbe used to one day make a difference in the lives of literally millions \nand millions of Americans.\n  I am the godfather of a child with juvenile diabetes. I cannot begin \nto state how my friend's family in Connecticut feels about legislation. \nI don't know what their politics are on this. I know they are a family \nwith deep values and a deep sense of support for their church. They are \nalso a family whose child's life could be made profoundly different if \nit were possible to examine embryonic stem cells thoroughly so that one \nday we can find a cure for juvenile diabetes. But, obviously there are \nothers diseases, including Parkinson's, ALS, cancer, and other \ndevastating conditions we can make a difference on. With the passage of \nthis bill, we can say to these children and these families we can make \na difference.\n  I emphasize, again, these 400,000 embryos would otherwise be \ndiscarded. Strict ethical requirements apply to the use of these \nembryos. In fact, I believe these ethical requirements are one of the \nmost essential provisions of the bill. Since the HELP Committee first \nbegan consideration of the President's policy on embryonic stem cell \nresearch in 2001, I have maintained that the pursuit of scientific \nresearch that may benefit millions of Americans and their families was \nas important as ensuring that science did not outpace ethics.\n  Under this legislation, the only embryonic stem cells that can be \nused for federally-funded research are those that were derived through \nembryos from in vitro fertilization clinics that were created for \nfertility treatment purposes and were donated for research with the \nwritten, informed consent of the individuals seeking that treatment. \nAny financial or other inducements to make this donation are \nprohibited. Their embryos will never be implanted in a woman and would \notherwise have\n\n[[Page S7690]]\n\nbeen discarded. The ethical requirements contained in this bill are \nstronger than current law. In fact, it's possible that some of the \ntwenty-one stem cell lines currently approved for federally-funded \nresearch, the so-called ``NIH-approved lines,'' may not meet the strict \nethical criteria contained in this bill.\n  I have heard some of my colleagues who oppose this legislation argue \nthat this legislation allows, even encourages, taxpayer-funded \ndestruction of human embryos. That is totally false. An amendment is \nattached to every annual Labor-HHS appropriations bill prohibiting any \nFederal funds from being used to destroy human embryos. This amendment, \nreferred to as the ``Dickey amendment,'' is not affected by this \nlegislation. Federal funds can be used to study stem cell lines that \nwere derived from human embryos that meet the ethical requirements I \njust laid out, but the derivation process itself cannot be funded using \nFederal dollars.\n  I have also heard some of my colleagues who oppose this legislation \nargue that embryonic stem cell research is unnecessary given the \nadvances in adult stem cell research. Let me quickly say, with respect \nto adult stem cells, I am strongly supportive of moving aggressively in \nthat area. I am a strong supporter. In fact, I authored the legislation \nwhich is now law advancing bone marrow and cord blood stem cell \ncollection for use in adult stem cell transplantation. For both of my \nyoung daughters, we took the umbilical cord blood from the children at \nbirth and it is being stored. My hope is that stem cells from cord \nblood will prove to be tremendously valuable to coming generations of \nAmericans. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting full funding \nfor this important law--which passed unanimously in the Senate--in the \nupcoming Labor-HHS appropriations bill.\n  The fact remains that there will always be limits to the use of adult \nstem cells when compared with embryonic stem cells and that is why the \nlegislation before us is so important. Our Nation's best scientists, \nincluding many Nobel Laureates, believe that embryonic stem cell \nresearch has a unique potential to ease human suffering and that is \nbecause embryonic stem cells, unlike adult stem cells, can become any \ncell in the body. Embryonic stem cells can become heart cells, lung \ncells, brain cells, among others, and that property--called \npluripotency--is unique to their embryonic state.\n\n  Let us not lose this opportunity. I urge the President to reconsider, \nto listen to the majority leader, listen to Senator Specter, Senator \nHarkin, and others who have spent countless hours examining this issue \nand see if he would not be willing to change his mind on this issue to \navoid a Presidential veto. My hope is we will get strong bipartisan \nsupport on this bill.\n  I intend to support the Fetal Farming Prohibition Act and the other \nlegislation being offered. I think those bills are unnecessary, but \nnonetheless I will be glad to support them. But let's also pass the \nStem Cell Research Enhancement Act by a strong vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, last year I made a commitment to try to \nbring H.R. 810, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, to the floor. \nThis week, I followed through on that promise. Over the last 2 days, we \nhave discussed science, we have discussed ethics and how those two \nissues, science and ethics, interplay.\n  That is important because stem cell research will be the first of \nmany major moral and ethical challenges to biomedical research that \nthis Senate has the responsibility to address in the 21st century. We \nwill face similar discussions again and again as biomedical science \nrapidly advances, especially as we learn more and more about molecular \nand cellular developmental biology. It is our responsibility as \nlegislators, as representatives of the American people, to determine \nthe proper role for our Federal Government, both in financial support, \nas well as in ethical oversight, in this evolving, new, exciting \nresearch and to build around it appropriate ethical safeguards and \nappropriate ethical framework.\n  As legislators, as representatives, we must participate in defining \nthis research, surrounding the culture of life. If we don't do so, the \nresearch itself will begin to define us and who we are.\n  Biomedical research holds great promise, but it is a promise that \nmust be harnessed within these moral and ethical safeguards. The \nsecret, the heart of human dignity, is living within limits--ethical \nlimits and moral limits--limits that do not hamper human scientific \nadvances but, rather, allow us to preserve and promote them. That is \nwhy it is important and appropriate that we can consider all three of \nthe bills that have been debated over the last 2 days. In the Fetus \nFarming Prohibition Act and the Stem Cell Therapies Enhancement Act, we \nrealize the potential of research practices that may actually bridge \nmoral and ethical differences, while the Stem Cell Research Enhancement \nAct seeks, by other means, to expand the number of embryonic stem cell \nlines available for federally funded research.\n  Over the last 2 days, we have engaged in a robust debate, a full \ndebate, highlighting the ethical dilemmas presented by research about \nthose very early beginnings of life, as well as the potential, the hope \nfor this research.\n  I close by making a final comment on what I believe is this inherent \nneed for policy surrounding science and add a cautionary note in this \ndiscussion. I am optimistic about the future. I am optimistic because \nof these remarkable, exciting, rapidly accelerating advances in \ndevelopmental biology. New doors of exploration have been exploding and \nopened by things such as the Human Genome Project, by our new knowledge \nof molecular genetics, molecular sequencing, cellular mechanisms. Some \nhave called the 21st century--we are in the early years of the 21st \ncentury--the century of the cells, a century that will explode with \nregenerative medicine, the ability to replace cells that had been \ndamaged by disease or ill health.\n  As a heart surgeon, I can't help but to dream of no longer having to \ncut out a diseased heart, a heart that is failing, and replace it with \na donated heart because advances in cell therapy, advances in \nregenerative medicine will allow us to repair tissues or regenerate \nthat new cardiac tissue, healthy tissue, without any surgery at all.\n  Ten years from now, today's hope can be that reality. In 15 years, \nwhole organ-heart transplantation could--we do not want to overstate \nbut could be relegated to the history books. That is why it is so \nimportant to bring this debate to this Senate, to allow science to \nadvance, to promote science with strong ethical oversight.\n  In the last century, we faced a whole range of ethical \nconsiderations; in my own field of heart transplantation, decisions \nabout how you define brain death. The discussion went on for years and \nyears, actually two decades, into the late 1960s, ethical discussions \nabout to whom you decide to give that healthy heart, when you have so \nmany people who are dying--ethical decisions that have to be made every \nday.\n  We have had controversies over blood transfusions, genetic therapy, \nwe even faced controversy over the treatment and diagnosis of HIV/AIDS. \nBut as we have seen over the course of today's and yesterday's debate, \nthe future will bring even more profound ethical questions. They will \ncontinue to come with increasing frequency as we continue to unlock \nthose mysteries of health and disease.\n  How we in humanity handle this gathering, this increasing control \nover cellular and molecular science, as well as developmental biology, \nwill reflect who we are as a people and where we are going. We can't \nhide from, as representatives of the American people, nor should we, \nthe questions that this new knowledge presents. Our votes today are a \nmere step, a first step toward beginning to answer them.\n  Throughout today's debate, I have heard a number of my colleagues, \nmyself included, talk about the potential for healing, that inherent \nhope offered by adult stem cells as well as embryonic stem cells, but \nit is important that advocates not oversell the potential for medical \ntreatment. As a physician, I understand the importance of promoting \nhope and of giving hope, but it is irresponsible to give false hope. \nThis evolving science is relatively new, and even our basic research \nhas to be done before we can truly give that hope to become reality, \nand even then we may encounter failure.\n  All of these are difficult issues on which people of very good faith \ncan\n\n[[Page S7691]]\n\nreasonably disagree. However, I hope that all can agree this debate and \nthe approach we took in this debate by considering three bills as a \npackage, each bill to be voted upon separately, is a fair way, is a \nthoughtful way, to begin to address the future of stem cell research.\n  The bills are important steps in defining science policy and \nadvancing the practice and science of medicine. To get this far, we had \nto set aside our differences. I am hopeful that at the end of the day \nwe will have made important strides forward in promoting biomedical \nadvancement in a responsible and in an ethical manner. I expect the \noutcome of these votes will demonstrate there is some consensus among \nMembers, even on this very divisive issue.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader \nfor yielding me the time.\n  As we prepare for the vote, it is my view that it is a clear-cut \nquestion to use embryos to save lives because otherwise they will be \ndestroyed. There are some 400,000 frozen embryos, and the choice is \ndiscarding them or using them to save lives.\n  Embryonic stem cells have the flexibility for the potential to cure \nParkinson's, Alzheimer's, heart disease and cancer.\n  I have a constituent, Jim Cordy, in Pittsburgh, PA, who suffers from \nParkinson's. Every time I see Jim Cordy, he displays an hour glass. He \ninverts it, and as the sand passes from one part of the hour glass to \nthe lower, Jim Cordy makes the dramatic point that is the way his life \nis slipping away in the absence of utilizing all means possible to cure \nParkinson's. The number one possibility is embryonic stem cell \nresearch.\n  Senator Brownback and I had a debate where he challenged me on when \nlife began, and I retorted--suffering from Hodgkin's cancer myself--the \nquestion on my mind was when life ended. Life will never begin for \nthese embryos because there are 400,000 frozen embryos in the US. \nNotwithstanding millions of dollars appropriated to encourage adoption, \nonly 128 have been adopted. So those lives will not begin, but many \nother lives will end if we do not use all the scientific resources \navailable.\n\n  In bygone years, Galileo was prosecuted when he insisted the world \nwas round. Columbus was discouraged from seeking America because the \nworld was flat and it was impossible to find a new continent. Boniface \nVIII stopped the use of cadavers, indispensable for medical research. \nAnd the Scottish Turks prohibited anesthesia for women in childbirth \nbecause it was God's will that women should suffer.\n  A century from now people will look back in amazement that we could \neven have this debate where the issues are so clear-cut. I urge my \ncolleagues to support S. 2754, which I cosponsored with Senator \nSantorum, which is long run----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Which promotes stem cell research without destroying the \nembryo. But the real core issue is the third vote on H.R. 810 which \nwill allow Federal funding, which is now in the range, at NIH, of $30 \nbillion a year, which can save so many lives.\n  I thank the majority leader and thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in just a few moments we will be voting on \nthree bills. The first bill we will be voting on is the Fetus Farming \nProhibition Act. The second bill we will be voting on is the \nalternative means, the alternative ways of deriving stem cells. And the \nthird is the House bill in support of research which is derived from \nblastocysts.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent it be in order to ask for the \nyeas and nays on all three bills en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I now ask for the yeas and nays on the \nthree bills.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the second and \nthird votes be limited to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 3:45 \nhaving arrived, the Senate will proceed to three consecutive votes.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bills.\n  The bills were ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and were \nread the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill, S. 3504, having been read the third \ntime, the question is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 100, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 204 Leg.]\n\n                               YEAS--100\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dayton\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n  The bill (S. 3504) was passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3504\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 534 which was submitted earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 534) condemning Hezbollah and its \n     state sponsors.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have grave concerns about what the coming \ndays hold for the situation in the Middle East. The spiral of violence, \nwhich began with the kidnaping of Israeli soldiers, is threatening to \nengulf the entire region. Unless something is done soon to stop the \nescalation, all out war--the likes of which has not been seen in the \nArab-Israeli conflict for decades--could soon be upon us.\n  Innocent lives are at risk. The rocket attacks on Israel are \nindiscriminate tools of terror. We know that Israeli bombs have also \ntaken innocent lives, including those of children. How does this \nfighting serve any greater purpose? Can there be no other way to solve \nthe important problems facing the region without shedding innocent \nblood in the process?\n  Let us not forget that it is not only the lives of Israelis, \nLebanese, and Palestinians that are threatened by the fighting. Press \nreports indicate that 25,000 Americans are in Lebanon, and some believe \nthat number is far too low an estimate. I have learned that a number of \nWest Virginians are in Lebanon now. Two of the families of West \nVirginians have children with them--children as young as 4 years old. \nOne of these families has already fled Beirut into the countryside \nwhile they await word on when they can be transported to safety.\n  I am hopeful that there are yet moderate voices in the international \ncommunity which seek solutions to this crisis. There are calls for an \ninternational peacekeeping force to stabilize the Israeli-Lebanese \nborder. There are also indications of behind- the-scenes diplomacy to \nunite all countries of the region in favor of a reasonable solution.\n\n[[Page S7693]]\n\n  The resolution before the Senate is not a voice of moderation. It is \na resolution that proposes only to point fingers at who is to blame for \nthe current violence. This is the wrong response to an international \ncrisis and a humanitarian tragedy.\n  Does this resolution help the Americans who are stranded in Lebanon \namidst this fighting? It does not. I fear that this resolution might, \nin fact, unleash a violent anti-American backlash at a time when the \nState Department and our Armed Forces are struggling to find a way to \nrescue our citizens. The Senate should have more sense than to rush to \npass such a provocative resolution at this time.\n  Mr. President, now is the time for moderation and wise counsel. We \nneed solutions, not recriminations. Why should the Senate pass a \nresolution, the only possible effect of which is to further entrench \nboth sides of the current conflict? I cannot support a resolution that \ndoes not I have the practical effect of advancing us toward an end to \nthis tragic violence.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate was advised by \nhotline that this resolution would be voted on last night by voice \nvote. I indicated a desire to be allowed to speak for no more than 15 \nminutes before the vote, and that was agreed to. I said explicitly when \nfurther inquiry came to me that I would not in any way--in any way--\nobject to the Senate, if the leadership so desired, to voting on that \nmeasure last night by voice vote. I went back, checked with the senior \nstaff of our cloakroom, and they verified it. There are e-mails to the \neffect that I said that.\n  I did have an opportunity to speak last night at length--it is in \nyesterday's Congressional Record--regarding my concerns about that \nlegislation, although I indicated in large measure I supported almost \nevery provision, and we just participated in a voice vote where, in \neffect, my vote was counted in the ``yea'' column.\n  Mr. President, I call to the attention of my colleagues my statement \nof yesterday beginning at page S7624.\n  Mr. President, I awakened this morning to determine that the press is \nreporting the following:\n\n       The Senate had been expected to quickly pass a resolution \n     Monday night, but Armed Services Committee Chairman John W. \n     Warner of Virginia blocked the vote.\n\n  That message was skillfully distributed throughout the world--the \nworldwide press. It made CNN and other responsible news organizations. \nThat was the deliberate attempt by some individual or individuals to \ndistort the truth, to distort what is in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to say that the remarks I made last night \nwere, in part, taken into consideration, and the resolution which the \nSenate will soon vote on does reflect what my principal concern was \nwith regard to the first draft; namely, that there was no reference to \nsome--upwards of 25,000 Americans seeking to return or leave that war-\ntorn area. Consequently, there is a provision, No. 11, placed in this \nresolution which says:\n\n       Recognizes that thousands of American nationals reside \n     peacefully in Lebanon, and that those American nationals in \n     Lebanon concerned for their safety should receive the full \n     support and assistance of the United States Government.\n\n  I am glad I did what I did--made it clear that this has worked its \nway into the Record. There are other concerns that I have which are \ncited in the statement that I made yesterday and I am delighted to have \nthe opportunity to correct what was a deliberate attempt to distort the \nrecord.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the resolution which \nI cosponsored and which the Senate passed today condemning the actions \nof Hezbollah and expressing our support for Israel.\n  On July 12, Hezbollah forces launched an attack through Syria, \ncrossing into Israel, killing eight Israelis and seizing two Israeli \nsoldiers as hostages. This assault followed months of rocket attacks by \nHezbollah on northern Israel. Those acts of terrorism created the \nsituation that the world confronts today. Israel could not tolerate \nsuch assaults on its own soil. No nation could.\n  Our country will stand with the Government and people of Israel as \nthey defend themselves. The U.S.-Israel relationship is one of the most \nimportant and steadfast diplomatic bonds in the world. It is imperative \nthat Congress express this support clearly and unequivocally. The \nresolution passed today makes this important statement, to our friends \nin Israel and to the world.\n  When Hezbollah escalated its attacks against Israel earlier this \nmonth, they dragged Lebanon into a conflict that neither the Lebanese \nGovernment nor most of the Lebanese people sought. Israel was compelled \nto respond to the violence on their soil. That was a situation that \nsimply could not continue. Nor can Israel afford to return to the state \nof affairs before the war. There must be a real change in Lebanon: the \ndays in which Hezbollah could simply lob rockets across the Israeli \nborder with impunity must end.\n  I believe the United States must play a principal role in helping to \nforge a solution to this conflict and its underlying causes: the \npersistent attacks on Israel and the capture of Israeli soldiers.\n  The conflict in Lebanon has broader international origins and \nthreatens the stability of the region as a whole. Iran and Syria are \ninvolved. They have long bankrolled Hezbollah and may have been \ninvolved in the plans to seize the Israeli soldiers. One of their goals \nmay have been to distract the world from Iran's efforts at nuclear \nenrichment. If so, we cannot let them succeed. We must not let the \nworld ignore Iran's efforts to move closer to the development of \nnuclear weapons.\n  We are handicapped in the Middle East by U.S. failures to remain \nconsistently engaged in the quest for peace over the last 6 years. U.S. \nengagement lends stability to the region; disengagement has the \nopposite effect. The war in Iraq also constrains our options in the \nMiddle East.\n  We need to take back control on other fronts--and the only way we can \ndo that is to send a signal to the Iraqis that they need to take charge \nand take responsibility for their own affairs. We need to be able to \ndedicate our resources to other emerging threats and challenges, and we \nneed to once again act as a pivotal peacemaker in the Middle East. I \nwish the resolution that we passed had discussed the need for sustained \nengagement at greater length and had placed increased emphasis on the \nneed for regional diplomacy.\n  Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, and others in the Arab world have \ncondemned Hezbollah's attacks on Israel. The Saudi foreign minister \nsaid, ``These acts will put the whole region back to years ago, and we \ncannot simply accept them.'' These unprecedented criticisms of \nHezbollah by Arab leaders offer at least the prospect that maybe the \nsituation offers a chance to move forward, rather than backward.\n  Secretary Rice has said that when the moment is right she will go to \nthe Middle East. I understand that she wants to lend her strength to \nthe cause when and where it will do the most good, but I hope that \nmoment will be soon. This conflict continues to increase in intensity \nand it could grow in scale as well. It is claiming far too many \ncasualties on both sides. Israeli citizens have been killed by \nHezbollah rockets that are now reaching deep into Israel. Casualties \nare especially high, as well, among Lebanese civilians. Over 200 \nLebanese civilians have been killed, caught in the crossfire of this \nconflict. Humanitarian concerns are growing as more Lebanese are \ndisplaced and as food and water in many shelters may be running low.\n  There are also some 25,000 Americans in Lebanon. They have been \ntrapped there. The Beirut airport has been bombed and so have many \nroadways. Some Americans have escaped by taking backroads to Syria. \nThat is a telling measure of how desperate the situation is for them. \nAccording to media sources, at least 8000 Americans want to leave. \nTheir loved ones in this country are frantic with worry. I have \nconstituents who are still trapped there. I am sure virtually every \nother senator does as well. People are frustrated by the pace of the \nevacuation, and I can understand that. Several hundred Americans have \nbeen evacuated, including children who were in Lebanon alone or \nindividuals in need of medical care. But thousands of Americans remain \ntrapped there.\n  U.S. Ambassador Jeffrey D. Feltman said that by the end of the week, \nthe\n\n[[Page S7694]]\n\nevacuation will proceed at a pace of 1,000 Americans a day. Since a \nSwedish ship departed today with over 1,000 Scandinavians and other \nEuropeans and with some 200 Americans on board, it is difficult to \nunderstand why we cannot marshal the resources to evacuate our citizens \nmore quickly.\n  I have also received many calls from constituents who were appalled \nto learn that one of the first things that Americans trapped in Lebanon \nhear from the State Department is that they will be charged for the \ncost of their evacuation to Cyprus. The United States must make clear \nto all the parties involved that we will move quickly to evacuate our \ncitizens. Those Americans should not bear the costs of this regional \ncrisis.\n  Secretary Rice has emphasized the need to safeguard civilian lives \nand to ``create sustainable conditions for political progress.''\n  The Israeli soldiers who are being held hostage by Hezbollah, and the \nsoldier captured by Hamas, must be released immediately and \nunconditionally. The rocket attacks on Israel, which began long before \nthis new phase of the conflict, must end. All the parties involved must \ncommit to abide by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559, \nwhich was adopted in 2004. This resolution requires that all militias, \nincluding Hezbollah, be disarmed and disbanded.\n  All of these principles are embodied in the legislation passed by the \nSenate today, along with an absolutely clear statement that we stand \nwith Israel. To make these principles a reality and to protect the \nlives of the innocent civilians caught in the crossfire in both Israel \nand Lebanon will clearly require sustained U.S. engagement in a \nregional solution.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the resolution.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 534) was agreed to.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the preamble \nbe agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 534\n\n       Whereas Israel fully complied with United Nations Security \n     Council Resolution 425 (adopted March 19, 1978) by completely \n     withdrawing its forces from Lebanon, as certified by the \n     United Nations Security Council and affirmed by United \n     Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan on June 16, 2000, when \n     he said, ``Israel has withdrawn from [Lebanon] in full \n     compliance with Security Council Resolution 425.'';\n       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559 \n     (adopted September 2, 2004) calls for the complete withdrawal \n     of all foreign forces and the dismantlement of all \n     independent militias in Lebanon;\n       Whereas despite Resolution 1559, the terrorist organization \n     Hezbollah remains active in Lebanon and has amassed thousands \n     of rockets aimed at northern Israel;\n       Whereas the Government of Lebanon, which includes \n     representatives of Hezbollah, has done little to dismantle \n     Hezbollah forces or to exert its authority and control \n     throughout all geographic regions of Lebanon;\n       Whereas Hezbollah receives financial, military, and \n     political support from Syria and Iran;\n       Whereas the United States has enacted several laws, \n     including the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty \n     Restoration Act of 2003 (22 U.S.C. 2151 note) and the Iran \n     and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996 (50 U.S.C. 1701 note), that \n     call for the imposition of sanctions on Syria and Iran for, \n     among other things, their support for terrorism and terrorist \n     organizations;\n       Whereas the Government of Israel has shown restraint in the \n     past year even though Hezbollah has launched at least 4 \n     separate attacks into Israel using rockets and ground forces;\n       Whereas, without provocation, on the morning of July 12, \n     2006, Hezbollah launched an attack into northern Israel, \n     killing 7 Israeli soldiers and taking 2 hostage into Lebanon;\n       Whereas on June 25, 2006, despite Israel's evacuation of \n     Gaza in 2005, the terrorist organization Hamas, which is also \n     supported by Syria and Iran, entered sovereign Israeli \n     territory, attacked an Israeli military base, killed 2 \n     Israeli soldiers, and captured an Israeli soldier, and has \n     refused to release that soldier;\n       Whereas rockets have been launched from Gaza into Israel \n     since Israel's evacuation of Gaza in 2005; and\n       Whereas both Hezbollah and Hamas refuse to recognize \n     Israel's right to exist and call for the destruction of \n     Israel: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) reaffirms its steadfast support for the State of \n     Israel;\n       (2) supports Israel's right of self-defense and Israel's \n     right to take appropriate action to deter aggression by \n     terrorist groups and their state sponsors;\n       (3) urges the President to continue fully supporting Israel \n     as Israel exercises its right of self-defense in Lebanon and \n     Gaza;\n       (4) calls for the immediate and unconditional release of \n     Israeli soldiers who are being held captive by Hezbollah or \n     Hamas;\n       (5) condemns the Governments of Iran and Syria for their \n     continued support for Hezbollah and Hamas, and holds the \n     Governments of Syria and Iran responsible for the acts of \n     aggression carried out by Hezbollah and Hamas against Israel;\n       (6) condemns Hamas and Hezbollah for exploiting civilian \n     populations as shields and locating their military activities \n     in civilian areas;\n       (7) urges the President to use all available political and \n     diplomatic means, including sanctions, to persuade the \n     governments of Syria and Iran to end their support of \n     Hezbollah and Hamas;\n       (8) calls on the Government of Lebanon to do everything in \n     its power to find and free the kidnapped Israeli soldiers \n     being held in its territory, and to fulfill its \n     responsibility under United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 1559 (adopted September 2, 2004) to disband and \n     disarm Hezbollah;\n       (9) calls on the United Nations Security Council to condemn \n     these unprovoked acts and to demand compliance with \n     Resolution 1559, which requires that Hezbollah and other \n     militias be disbanded and disarmed, and that all foreign \n     forces be withdrawn from Lebanon; and\n       (10) urges all sides to protect innocent civilian life and \n     infrastructure and strongly supports the use of all \n     diplomatic means available to free the captured Israeli \n     soldiers.\n       (11) recognizes that thousands of American nationals reside \n     peacefully in Lebanon, and that those American nationals in \n     Lebanon concerned for their safety should receive the full \n     support and assistance of the United States government.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/18/senate-section/article/S7694-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7694-S7739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, last Thursday Senator Jeffords and I took \nsome time to thank the members of our committee and many on the outside \nfor cooperation in bringing to the Senate the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act. This is a very big bill. It is a very significant \nbill. It involved the cooperation of quite a number of people. I would \nsay every member of our committee has been very cooperative. I talked a \nlittle bit about Senator Feingold and the fact he had some objections. \nHe was very good to work with, along with Senator McCain and others.\n  We finally are at the point now where, after a lot of negotiation, \nthe Senate is considering today S. 728, the Water Resources Development \nAct of 2006.\n  As the world's leading maritime and trading nation, the United States \nrelies on an efficient maritime transportation system to maintain its \nrole as a global power. The bill we debate today is the cornerstone of \nthat system.\n  The Water Resources Development Act, or WRDA, sets out the Federal \npolicy of procedure for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to maintain \nand build our inland and intracoastal waterway system, which carries \none-sixth of the Nation's volume of intercity cargo.\n  In addition, the Corps is responsible for maintaining approximate \nchannel depths in ports along our coasts and the Great Lakes to handle \n95 percent of all foreign trade into and out of the country. In fact, \nmore than 67 percent of all consumer goods pass through harbors \nmaintained by the Corps of Engineers. WRDA also authorizes the Corps to \nwork with communities on flood damage reduction and hurricane and storm \ndamage reduction projects designed to protect human life and property.\n  Inland and intracoastal waterways, which serve States on the Atlantic \nseaboard, the gulf coast, and the Pacific Northwest, move about 630 \nmillion tons of cargo valued at over $70 billion annually. Furthermore, \nit is estimated that the average transportation cost savings to users \nof the system is $10.67 per ton, or $7 billion annually over other \nmodes of transportation.\n  The nearly 12,000 miles of inland and intracoastal waterways include \n192 commercially active lock and dam sites. I might add, a lot of \npeople are surprised these are in my State of Oklahoma. Over 50 percent \nof the locks and dams operated by the Corps are more than 50 years old \nand consequently are approaching the end of their design life and are \nin need of modernization or major rehabilitation. This bill authorizes \nongoing work to modernize and rehabilitate our inland and intracoastal \nwaterway system.\n  In the 1800s, the Corps was first called upon to address flood \nproblems along the Mississippi River. Since then, the Corps has \ncontinued to provide flood damage reduction along the Mississippi River \nand in other regions of the country. These efforts range from small \nlocal protection to projects such as levees, or nonstructural measures, \nto major dams. Today, most of the structures are owned by sponsoring \ncities, towns, and agricultural districts. Although the Corps cannot \nprevent all damage from floods, the efforts of the Corps do \nsignificantly reduce the cost of the flood events.\n  To illustrate this point, consider that during the 10 years from 1991 \nto 2000, the decade of the 1990s, the country suffered $45 billion in \nproperty damage from floods. If Corps flood damage reduction measures \nhad not been in place, however, that figure would have been more than \n$208 billion in damage. Clearly, flood control is a wise investment. \nAccording to the American Society of Civil Engineers, the flood control \nstructures on average prevent $22 billion in flood damage each year, a \nsavings of $6 per every $1 spent.\n  Second, similarly, the Corps also participates in and this bill \nauthorizes hurricane and storm damage reduction projects along our \nNation's coast as well as projects to combat shoreline erosion. So we \nare talking now about three aspects: navigation, the hurricanes, and \nthe erosion problem.\n  And then the third Corps mission is ecosystems restoration. Working \nwith non-Federal sponsors, the Corps implements single-purpose \necosystems, restoration projects, multipurpose projects with ecosystems \nrestoration components, or projects for flood protection or navigation \nthat incorporate environmental features as good engineering. The Corps \nhas restored, created, and protected over 500,000 acres of wetlands and \nother habitats between 1988 and 2004. In some cases, existing water \nresources projects are modified to achieve restoration benefits.\n  This bill includes authorization of several such projects, including \nquickly approaching the crisis that, if ignored, would dramatically \nstunt continued economic growth.\n  We have to understand right now, with what is happening in this \ncountry, the increase in economic activity is what has brought us out \nof this recession. The deficits people in this Senate like to talk \nabout are being addressed by the fact that, for each additional 1 \npercent of economic activity, it increases revenues about $45 billion. \nThis bill is going to be very helpful in increasing economic activity.\n\n  As one of the most fiscally conservative Members of this Senate, I \nhave long argued that the two most important functions of the Federal \nGovernment are to provide for national defense and public \ninfrastructure. A lot of my conservative colleagues are going to be \ntalking about projects and maybe earmarks. That is not in this bill we \nare talking about. They might be surprised to know that I, with a \nrating of 100 percent by the American Conservative Union, this year and \nlast year, am proposing this bill, which is a big spending bill, but we \nare not spending. We are authorizing. We have an orderly procedure to \nreach those projects which would enjoy the most support.\n\n[[Page S7726]]\n\n  I say to my conservative friends, I am one who is not for wasteful \nspending. I have maintained the perfect record in terms of my \nconservative leanings. In fact, it is exactly what being a fiscal \nconservative is all about.\n  The primary purpose of government spending is to provide for the \nnational defense and to provide for critical infrastructure. Think how \nchaotic the system would be if each individual would build and maintain \ntheir own infrastructure system. Society simply would not function. \nEvery first-year political science student learns that the function of \nthe body politic is to provide resources that are used by all. \nEfficiency and economics require the Government not only plan but \nconstruct and maintain public infrastructure. So I am not shy about \nvoting for increased authorization on national defense needs or public \ninfrastructure.\n  At the same time, we have to spend limited tax dollars wisely, with \nthat in mind, on three major restoration projects in Louisiana, \nFlorida, and the Upper Mississippi River Basin. Unfortunately, as other \ninfrastructure bills, WRDA has been decried in the press perhaps as a \npork bill. During the debate in the Senate we may hear from some who \nwill agree with that. It is the popular thing to say. As one of the \nprimary authors of the bill, allow me to explain why this charge, if \nraised, is not accurate.\n  First, contrary to public belief, this bill is not just project \nauthorization. It contains also significant policy changes designed to \nensure an efficient and effective process for addressing our Nation's \nwater resources needs. Later in this debate, Senators will have an \nopportunity to consider several amendments on further policy reforms.\n  The bill does have project authorizations. It is an unfortunate fact \nof life when infrastructure bills are debated we first have to battle \nback the charge that all we are doing is funding unneeded projects.\n  Look at the facts. According to the American Society of Civil \nEngineers 2005 report cards on America's infrastructure, none of the \nNation's primary infrastructure such as roads, airports, drinking water \nfacilities, wastewater management systems, gets above a C, and most \nreceive a D. That is without exception. None. And every project \nauthorization is quickly approaching a crisis that, if ignored, will \ndramatically stunt continued economic growth. We are at the point now \nwhere we need to do something.\n  With that in mind, the committee established a very firm policy of \nwhat types of project requests we would consider. Every project \nauthorization included in this bill is based on a report of the Chief \nof Engineers verifying that the project is technically feasible, \neconomical, economically justified, and environmentally accepted.\n  I will talk a little bit about the types of engineering reports that \nare necessary. We did not include environmental infrastructure projects \nsuch as water treatment facilities or riverfront development projects \nbecause neither of these are a Corps of Engineers mission. Finally, we \ndid not authorize cost-share waivers on existing or new projects. We \nhave always felt the local community has to have an investment and has \nto have the support of the State, county, or city in order to come \nforth with the project.\n  At the present time, Senator Bond and I will be offering two \namendments, one on prioritization of projects, and another establishing \na procedure of independent peer review. Both of these issues are \nimportant reforms to the program. We agree that Congress needs better \nanalysis so we can more easily compare individual projects, thereby \nensuring the most needed projects are addressed in a timely manner. \nIndependent peer review fulfills a critical function to ensure that \npolicymakers are using accurate information to make decisions. \nTherefore, Senator Bond and I will be offering an amendment to clarify \nwhich projects should undergo independent peer review.\n  Finally, some have expressed a concern about the size of the bill. I \nunderstand and appreciate these concerns. However, I point out that it \nhas been 6 years since the last WRDA bill was signed into law. \nTraditionally, WRDA is done every 2 years. Given the 6-year timelag, \nwhat the Senate is being asked to consider represents what would be \nthree WRDAs if we had kept to the 2-year schedule. Given that, I \nbelieve the cost is reasonable.\n  The amount of this bill would be eventually about $7 billion in \nauthorization. However, if we were to follow the pattern set in 2000, \nfor a 2-year bill, it was 5.07, so it is considerably less than if we \nhad been doing it every 2 years as we did in the year 2000.\n  For the benefit of those who may not be familiar with the Army Corps \nof Engineers program, let me explain. The program does include \nplanning, design, construction, maintenance, and operation of water \nprojects that give improved flood damage reduction, hurricane and storm \ndamage reduction, shore protection, navigation, ecosystems restoration, \nhydroelectric power, recreation, and other various water resources \nneeded. Virtually all water resources projects are cost shared with a \nlocal sponsor. The statutory cost share varies depending on the size of \nthe project. Generally speaking, the local share is about 35 percent; \nthe Federal share is about 65 percent.\n\n  Projects generally originate with a request for assistance from a \ncommunity or local government entity with the water resource need that \nis beyond its capability to alleviate. A study authority allows the \nCorps to investigate a problem and determine if there is a Federal \ninterest in proceeding further.\n  If the Corps has performed a study in the geographic area before this \ntime--in other words, if it has already done it--a new study can be \nauthorized by a resolution of either the Senate Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works, the committee I chair, or the House \nCommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure. If the Corps has not \npreviously investigated the area, the study needs to be authorized by \nan act of Congress, typically through what we are considering today, a \nWRDA bill.\n  Army Corps studies are usually conducted in two stages: the first, \ncalled a reconnaissance study, or the recon study, is a general \ninvestigation, including an overview of the problem, identification of \npotential local sponsors--that could be State, tribal, county, or local \nagencies or governments or nonprofit organizations--and an initial \ndetermination of a Federal interest. A recon study is done at full \nFederal expense and usually costs $100,000 to $200,000 and usually can \nbe completed in about a year.\n  The second stage is a feasibility study, which is the detailed \nanalysis of alternatives, costs, benefits, and environmental and other \nimpacts. A feasibility study is cost-shared 50-50 with a local sponsor, \nusually costing upwards of $1 million and takes up to several years to \ncomplete.\n  Congress must provide authorization for the Corps to begin the recon \nstudy, but the Corps can move from the recon to feasibility stage \nwithout further authorization. Based on the results of the study, the \nchief of engineers may--this is the significant part--may sign a final \nrecommendation on the project, known as the Chief's Report. \nAccordingly, the committee has used a favorable Chief's Report as the \nbasis for authorizing projects.\n  I am going through this process so people will understand this has \nbeen thoughtfully considered in each one of these, and the Corps has \ngone into them and actually come out with a final Chief's Report. I \nhave to say, individuals who sometimes complain about the way the Corps \nis working might remember in the late 1990s when we had the Everglades \nRestoration Act. I happen to be the only Member who voted against it. \nIt was 99 to 1, I say to the Presiding Officer. The reason I voted \nagainst it is because it did not have a Chief's Report. We have to stay \nwith this system.\n  Before I yield the floor to my colleagues, I want to point out some \nother provisions in the managers' substitute amendment that were added \nto the committee-reported bill. The primary changes were made in \nresponse to the devastating hurricanes that hit the gulf coast last \nyear.\n  We are proposing a new National Levee Safety Program designed after \nthe National Dam Safety Program. The new Levee Safety Program requires \nthat a national inventory be made of all levees and that those levees \nthat protect human life and public safety be inspected. As with the Dam \nSafety Program, the provision establishes a State grant program to \nencourage States to establish their own safety program, as\n\n[[Page S7727]]\n\nthese activities are best handled at the local level.\n  We also made some changes to language already in the bill to \nauthorize a project for coastal wetlands restoration in Louisiana. \nThese changes are intended to address the two main suggestions for \nprocess improvements that the Environment and Public Works Committee \nheard from a broad range of stakeholders following Hurricane Katrina.\n  First, we try to do a better job of addressing our water resources \nneeds in a comprehensive, integrated manner, rather than in the \ntraditional stovepipe manner of separate missions areas.\n  Secondly, the time it takes between identifying a water resources \nneed to completing a solution is significantly longer than it should \nbe. Our substitute amendment addresses the time from identification of \nneed to solution.\n  So we are going to proceed with this bill. I have a request from a \nwell-respected Senator, but I am going to ask if the Senator could \nwithhold until we have the opening statements done.\n  Let me say, in closing, I have a special interest in this bill \nbecause--a lot of people do not realize it, and I am sure the Chair \ndoes because he is aware of these things--my State of Oklahoma is in \nthat way navigable. We have a navigation way that comes all the way to \nthe Port of Catoosa. That is in Tulsa, OK. It was put together by a \nState authorization in legislation that was passed by my father-in-law, \nthe late Arthur Patrick, in the early 1930s. And you might have heard \nof the McClellan-Kerr Dam. That is the one that is there. So we have \nthat history, and I have that bias that I bring to this floor with my \nopening remarks.\n  With that, let me thank the ranking minority member, Senator \nJeffords, who has been so cooperative throughout the development of \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I say thank you to the Senator. It is a \npleasure to work with you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend briefly.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4676\n\n  Under the previous order, the reported committee amendments are \nwithdrawn. The managers' substitute at the desk, amendment No. 4676, is \nagreed to, and the bill, as so amended, is original text for further \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4676) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased to see the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act of 2006 finally being considered on the Senate floor. \nThis critical water resources bill is long overdue. The last one was \ncompleted 6 years ago.\n  Despite never receiving a water resources proposal from the \nadministration, we are here today with a good, comprehensive bill, and \nI hope we can work together to finally get it enacted this year.\n  With this legislation, we maintain our commitment to the protection \nof our rivers, streams, and lakes. We also protect our aquatic \necosystems, which are so delicate and yet so vital to critical species.\n  We help our States and local communities manage their water resources \nthrough navigation and shoreline protection projects, as well as \nprovide flood and storm damage protection.\n  This bill includes the authorization of key coastal restoration and \nhurricane protection projects to help the State of Louisiana recover \nfrom Hurricane Katrina.\n  There are also some very important project authorizations for my \nState of Vermont, including ecosystem restoration for the Upper \nConnecticut River and small dam removal and remediation throughout the \nState.\n  In addition, I am pleased this bill updates to the Army Corps of \nEngineers principles and guidelines to improve the efficiency of the \nCorps. I am disappointed, however, that some important Corps reform \nprovisions were not included in this bill, such as stronger provisions \nfor independent peer review.\n  Hurricane Katrina tragically reminded us of the importance of \ncomprehensive reform of the Army Corps of Engineers. I am cosponsoring \nSenator Feingold's amendment on this topic and encourage my colleagues \nto join us in support of this reform.\n  In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, the Corps has a tarnished record in \nmany people's minds. The independent review language that will be \noffered by Senators Feingold and McCain, coupled with the other reforms \nwe have included in the underlying bill, are critical first steps in \nour efforts to ensure that the Corps has adequate tools and appropriate \noversight of its programs.\n  This water resources bill represents a step forward in our efforts to \nprotect our water resources, enhance environmental restoration, and \nspur economic development.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to our debate on this bill. I urge my \ncolleagues to support its passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the minority leader of our \ncommittee who has done such a good job.\n  Let me announce what I would like to do and see if there is any \nobjection. I will not pose this as a UC, but I will mention we have \nsome people who do have to leave. We had announced earlier we would go \nstraight to the Boxer amendment. I am in support of the Boxer \namendment, and that is not going to take a long time. However, she has \ngraciously agreed to let the Senator from Michigan go in advance of her \nfor 10 minutes.\n  The question I would like to ask the Senator from Michigan is, would \nit be permissible, and not counted against the time of the Senator from \nCalifornia, if Senator Santorum went for 3 minutes prior to you? This \nis at the conclusion of the remarks of the Senator from Missouri. Would \nthat be all right? It would put you off only 3 minutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Yes. Through the Presiding Officer to the chairman, \nthank you very much for including me in this process. My question would \nonly be, how much time does the Senator from Missouri require?\n  Mr. INHOFE. How much time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am, regretfully, limited by having to be \nat a markup in a subcommittee I chair, and I will limit my remarks to \nabout 15 to 18 minutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Certainly, Mr. Chairman, I would have no objection.\n  Mr. INHOFE. After the conclusion of his remarks---\n  Mrs. BOXER. Can you do a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Missouri be first recognized for 15 to 18 minutes, immediately \nfollowed by Senator Santorum for not to exceed 4 minutes, and then \nSenator Stabenow for not to exceed 10 minutes. And then we will proceed \non to the Boxer amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. For 20 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. For whatever time she wants to use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I particularly thank \nour leader, Senator Frist, and the minority leader, Senator Reid, for \nbringing WRDA to the floor. This is a long and arduous process, and we \nare grateful they were able to bring together this tremendously \nimportant bill.\n  I pay special thanks to the chairman of the committee, Senator \nInhofe, and his staff, and the ranking member, Senator Jeffords, and \nhis staff. This has been a truly bipartisan process--a lot longer \nprocess than we intended because this was supposed to have been the \n2002 WRDA bill. Nevertheless, we have the much needed Water Resources \nDevelopment Act before us, authorizing projects under the jurisdiction \nof the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n  These projects are of tremendous value to the entire Nation. They \nprovide drinking water, electric power production, river \ntransportation, recreation, flood protection, environmental protection \nand restoration, and emergency response.\n  Few agencies in the Federal Government touch as many citizens as the \nCorps does. The Corps provides one-quarter of our Nation's total \nhydropower output, operates 463 lake recreation areas, moves 630 \nmillion tons of cargo valued at over $73 billion annually through our \ninland system, manages over 12 million acres of land and\n\n[[Page S7728]]\n\nwater, provides 3 trillion gallons of water for use by local \ncommunities and businesses, and has prevented an estimated $706 billion \nin flood damage within the past 25 years with an investment of less \nthan one-seventh that value.\n  During the 1993 flood, which we experienced in Missouri with great \ndevastation, an estimated $19.1 billion in flood damage was prevented \nby flood control facilities in place at the time.\n  WRDA, as I indicated, is a bipartisan bill, traditionally produced by \nCongress every 2 years, making possible America's major flood control \nprojects, coastal protection, environmental protection and restoration, \ntransportation, and recreation on our major waterways.\n  Despite its importance, we have not passed a bill since 2000. The \nlonger we wait, the more unmet needs pile up and the more complicated \nthe demands upon the bill become, making it harder and harder to win \napproval.\n  The public voice is loud, clear, and spoken often regarding how they \nfeel about the need for our long-overdue and much needed WRDA \nlegislation.\n  We believe the bill before the Senate is a good one that balances the \nneeds of States for environmental restoration of key waterways and for \nnavigation projects that create economic growth.\n  The bill before us will create jobs, spur economic development and \ntrade competitiveness, and improve the environment. And it is \nfinancially responsible.\n  To say it is widely supported is an understatement. It passed the EPW \nCommittee by voice vote. Eighty of our colleagues signed a letter to \nleadership urging floor action--80 out of 100. It is tough for us to \nget 80 together on anything, but they said: We want this bill. The \nHouse cleared it with an overwhelming vote of 406 for it.\n  Environmental restoration, in the last 20 years, has become a primary \nCorps mission.\n  Our water resources perform a variety of functions simultaneously. \nThey can provide transportation and protection from floods and habitats \nfor many species. Similarly, when it comes to Corps projects, \nnavigational and flood control projects can and should be \nenvironmentally sound. Environmental restoration can help prevent or \nminimize flooding during the next major storm, and many other benefits.\n  The Corps is leading some of the world's largest ecosystem \nrestoration projects. And the commanding feature of this bill is its \nlandmark environmental and ecosystem restoration authorities. More than \nhalf of the cost of the bill consists of authorization for \nenvironmental restoration projects.\n  Think of all the major waterways that are important to America--to \nour environmental heritage, to recreation, and to commerce. This bill \naffects all of them.\n  Among the projects in this bill are those that will restore wetlands \nin the Upper Connecticut River Basin in Vermont and New Hampshire; \nrestore oyster habitat in the Chesapeake Bay; restore fisheries in the \nGreat Lakes; implement an environmental management program for the Rio \nGrande River; continue restoration of the Everglades; restore areas of \ncoastal Louisiana damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita; restore \nhabitat on the Upper Mississippi and Illinois waterways; restore oyster \nhabitat on Long Island Sound.\n  Flood control is also important. If we have learned anything from \nMother Nature in the last 15 years, it is that we frequently need \nprotection from her storms. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita are just two of \nthe latest devastating examples.\n  As I said, the good news is Corps projects had an estimated $706 \nbillion in flood damage within the past 25 years with an investment \none-seventh that value. This legislation authorizes flood control \nprojects in California, Louisiana, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, \nMaryland, West Virginia, Minnesota, Kentucky, South Carolina, Idaho, \nWashington, and Missouri, to name a few.\n  While the majority of this legislation is for environmental \nprotection and restoration, a key bipartisan economic initiative \nincluded provides transportation efficiency and environmental \nsustainability on the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers.\n  As the world becomes more competitive, America must also become more \ncompetitive. Between 1970 and 2003, the value of U.S. trade increased \n24-fold and 70 percent since 1994. That is an average annual growth of \n10.2 percent--nearly double the pace of the GDP growth for the same \nperiod. We can expect demand for U.S. exports to continue increasing \ndramatically over many years.\n  We have to ask ourselves where the growth in transportation will \noccur in the next 20 to 50 years to accommodate the growth in demand \nfor commercial shipping. The Department of Transportation suggests that \ncongestion on our roads and rails will double in the next quarter \ncentury.\n  Now, those who drive on the highways know how crowded they are. How \nwould you like to see all of the transportation that we now put on \nwater go on the roads? Ask any farmer who has found difficulty getting \nrail availability to ship product, commodities, because there is heavy \ndemand. Water transportation is a great untapped capacity.\n  One medium-sized barge tow carries the freight of 870 trucks. On the \nroad are 2.25 100-car unit trains, 250-car unit trains, and 1 barge \ncarries the equivalent of 15 jumbo hopper cars. Now, how does that \ntranslate into the use of energy? We ought to be concerned about energy \nconservation. Well, the good news is that water transportation \nconserves fuel and protects the air and environment. How? How far will \none gallon of fuel move one ton of freight? If you are going by truck, \none gallon of fuel can move a ton of freight 59 miles. If you are going \nby rail, it can move it 386 miles. But if you are going by water, it \ncan move it 522 miles. That is almost 10-to-1 more efficient than \ntrucks and 1.5 times as efficient as rail. The rail just isn't there. \nThe rail system is overcrowded already.\n  Over the past 35 years, waterborne commerce on the Upper Mississippi \nRiver has more than tripled. The system currently carries 60 percent of \nour Nation's corn exports and 45 percent of our Nation's soybean \nexports, and it does so at two-thirds the cost of rail--when rail is \navailable.\n  In Missouri alone, we ship 34.7 million tons of commodities with a \ncombined value of more than $4 billion. That is not just farm products. \nIt includes coal, petroleum, aggregates, grain, chemicals, iron, steel, \nminerals, and other commodities, and, yes, the corn, soybean, and wheat \nthat we export overseas.\n  Our navigable waterways are in environmental and economic decline. \nJobs and markets and the availability of habitat for fish and wildlife \nare at stake. The American Society for Civil Engineers grades navigable \nwaterways infrastructure D- with over 50 percent of the locks \n``functionally obsolete'' despite increased demand.\n  So we have developed a plan that gets the Corps back in the business \nof building the future, rather than just haggling about predicting the \nfuture.\n  This legislation contains authorization for funding to improve \nnavigation on a number of our major waterways in several States, \nincluding Louisiana, Texas, Alaska, Virginia, Delaware, and Maine.\n  A key piece of the bill modernizes locks and dams on the Upper \nMississippi and Illinois Rivers. We authorize capacity expansion on \nlocks 20 to 25 on the Mississippi River and Peoria and LaGrange on the \nIllinois.\n  New 1,200-foot locks on the Mississippi River will provide equal \ncapacity in the bottleneck region. Upstream from the Keokuk, there is a \nlock 19 which is 1,200 feet, and below them at St. Louis are locks 26 \nand 27. They are also 1,200 feet. These 600-foot locks serve as major \nwater roadblocks to transportation of our products to the world markets \nand inputs to users upstream.\n  One-half of the cost of the new locks will be paid for by private \nusers who pay into the Inland Waterways Trust Fund. Additional funds \nwill be provided for mitigation and small scale and nonstructural \nmeasurements to improve efficiency.\n  If you are for increased trade, commercial growth, and job creation, \nyou cannot get there without supporting the basic transportation \ninfrastructure, as our chairman has so eloquently pointed out. New \nefficiency helps give our producers an edge that can make or break \nopportunities in the international marketplace.\n\n[[Page S7729]]\n\n  As we look 50 years into the future, we have to ask ourselves a \nfundamental question: Should we have a system that promotes growth or \nshould we be confined to a transportation straitjacket designed not for \n2050 but for 1950 with paddle wheel boats?\n\n  We must ask ourselves if dramatic investments should be made to \naddress environmental problems and opportunities that exist on these \ngreat waterways?\n  In both cases, the answer, to me, is simple. Of course we should \nimprove and modernize. The choice is a very important one today as we \nhave a global economy. Our farmers are the most efficient in the world, \nbut transportation costs can knock them out of the world market. We \nknow our competitors are modernizing their water transportation.\n  Here is a very troubling picture. This is one of our foremost exports \nright now. You know what they are exporting? Not renewable crops that \ncome from our fields. These are 2 towboats and 30 barges headed for \nArgentina. Argentina and Brazil and other Latin American countries are \ntaking imports from our water transportation system because they have \nthe waterways to use them and we don't. Do you want to make a one-time \nsale of the barges or towboats, or do you want to have sales every year \non the goods and commodities these can produce?\n  Seventy years ago, some argued that a transportation system on the \nMississippi River was not justified. Congress, fortunately, decided \nthat its role was not to try to predict the future but to shape it and \ndecided to invest in a system despite the naysayers. Over 84 million \ntons per year later, it is clear that the decision was wise.\n  The veteran chief economist at USDA testified that transportation \nefficiency and the ability of farmers to win markets and higher prices \nare ``fundamentally related.'' He predicts that corn exports over the \nnext 10 years will rise 45 percent, 70 percent of which will travel \ndown the Mississippi River--if the river has the capacity to carry it.\n  The decision to improve these waterways has not been taken lightly. \nAs has already been pointed out, all decisions and procedures have been \ndocumented and coordinated with an interagency Federal Principals \nGroup, independent technical reviews and stakeholders, and have been \nmade available for public review and comment.\n  The Corps of Engineers spent $70 million completing a study that was \nanticipated to take 6 years and cost $12 million, but it actually took \n14 years to complete. During that period, there have been 35 meetings \nof the Governors Liaison Committee, 28 meetings on the Economic \nCoordinating Committee, among the States along the Upper Mississippi \nand Illinois waterways, 44 meetings of the Navigation and Environmental \nCoordination Committee; and there have been 3,879 public involvement \nactivities concerning the Upper Mississippi River alone.\n  Additionally, there have been 130 briefings for special interest \ngroups and 24 newsletters. There have been 6 sets of public meetings in \n46 locations, with over 4,000 people in attendance. To say the least, \nthis has been a very long, very transparent, and very representative \nprocess.\n  While we have been studying, our competitors have been building. \nGiven the extraordinary delay so far, and given the reality that large-\nscale construction takes decades, further delay is no longer an option.\n  That is why I am pleased to join the bipartisan group of Senators who \nagree that we must improve the efficiency and the environmental \nsustainability of our great resources.\n  The transportation efficiency provisions are supported by a broad-\nbased group of the States, farm groups, shippers, labor, and those who \npay taxes into the trust fund for improvements.\n  Of particular note, I appreciate the strong support from the \ncarpenters, laborers, operating engineers, Iron Workers, Teamsters, the \nNature Conservancy, the Audubon Group, and the construction and energy \nand agriculture people.\n  Also, I mention specifically the good efforts of Senators Talent, \nDurbin, Obama, Grassley, and Harkin, who have given strong bipartisan \nsupport.\n  For some, the bill is too small; for others, it is too big. It is \nimportant to understand the budget implications in the real world. We \nare contending with difficult budget realities. It is critical to be \nmindful of those realities as we make investments in the infrastructure \nthat support those who make and grow and buy and sell things so that we \ncan expand our economy, create jobs, and, yes, pay taxes and secure our \nfuture.\n  This is an authorization bill that doesn't spend a single dollar, not \none. Like other authorization bills, it makes projects eligible for \nfunding under constraints administered by Congress. The Appropriations \nCommittee and the President will have final say. Those who don't make \nit won't be funded.\n  The WRDA process simply allows for projects to be considered during \nthe process of appropriations. I hear some suggest we should not \nauthorize anything new until everything previously authorized has been \nfunded. That is nonsense because it falsely assumes that all projects \nauthorized 5, 10, 15 years ago are higher priority than those we have \nnow. That is not true.\n  In fact, we have eliminated the authorization for 56 projects \ntotaling over $500 million in savings. The remaining projects will be \nsubject to the appropriations process.\n  People have talked about Corps reform. I want to make sure we reform \nit and don't kill it. I agree that we need to be sure every project is \nauthorized, is needed, and is economically justifiable.\n  The Corps continues to make agency-wide planning improvements that \nare responsive to stakeholders' needs and responsible to taxpayers.\n  The Corps includes independent review in all project studies and \nreview by outside independent experts for larger, higher risk and \ncomplex projects. Peer review is integrated into project development.\n  The Corps is developing new tools to examine regional and watershed \nissues that will allow a broader view of complex water resource issues.\n  The bill contains provisions that will further improve the \nreliability of Corps analyses of projects.\n  Now, there are many--particularly community leaders around the \ncountry--who believe there is already too much redtape, delay, cost, \nand uncertainty. There are those who want less redtape. I strongly \nagree with them. Others want more redtape. But I think we strike a \nnecessary balance in the bill.\n  We have embraced a commonsense, bipartisan proposal by Senators \nLandrieu and Cochran that requires major projects to be subject to \nindependent review.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 18 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the Landrieu-Cochran proposal requires that \nnecessary mitigation for projects be completed at the same time the \nproject is completed or no longer than 1 year afterward. This will \nimpose a cost on communities, particularly smaller ones, but it is not \nas onerous as regulations proposed 2 years ago which ultimately \nprevented a final agreement between the House and Senate. For some, the \nnew regulations are too onerous; for others, not enough. As I said, I \nbelieve we strike a balance.\n  This legislation is supported by over 250 organizations representing \nthe environment, agriculture, labor, and chambers of commerce. I ask \nunanimous consent that the letter from the National Waterways Alliance \nlisting these groups be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  National Waterways Alliance,\n\n                                     Arlington, VA, June 30, 2006.\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,\n     Senate Russell Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: After six long years, we finally have \n     hope for passage of the Water Resources Development Act of \n     2006 (WRDA). Our country cannot afford further delay. Clearly \n     the time has come, particularly in light of the lessons \n     learned from Hurricane Katrina, for Congress to complete its \n     work on this crucial legislation for our nation's water \n     resources.\n       As Senate leaders prepare the bill for floor consideration, \n     we urge you to: (a) Request that the Majority Leader bring \n     the bill to the floor quickly; (b) Accept the Inhofe-Bond \n     Amendments and Reject the Feingold-\n\n[[Page S7730]]\n\n     McCain ``Corps reform'' amendments. (See attachment.)\n       S. 728, much like its House of Representatives counterpart, \n     represents a workable compromise to address and provide \n     guidance on a number of policy issues, including the need to \n     strengthen the Army Corps of Engineers' feasibility study \n     process, provide meaningful project peer reviews and refine \n     mitigation standards to embody sound ecological science. In \n     addition, S. 728 provides authorization for many important \n     projects with the potential to improve our economy, ease our \n     nation's growing problem of congestion and dependence on \n     foreign oil, and enrich our quality of life and environment.\n       Our water resources system contributes mightily to our \n     nation's well-being. Ports and waterways are the backbone of \n     our transportation system--ensuring domestic and \n     international trade opportunities and a safe, economical and \n     eco-friendly transportation alternative--for products such as \n     steel, coal, fertilizer, salt, sand and gravel, cement, \n     petroleum, chemicals, etc. In addition, the U.S. maritime \n     transportation system moves more than 60 percent of the \n     nation's grain exports. Our flood damage reduction program \n     saves lives and prevents almost $8 in property losses for \n     each dollar spent. Corps' hydropower facilities supply 24% of \n     the hydropower generated in the United States. Projects for \n     water supply, irrigation, recreation, beach nourishment and \n     wildlife habitat provide innumerable benefits.\n       We solidly support expeditious passage of S. 728 as a \n     balanced and responsive Water Resources Development Act, and \n     urge you to do the same. The Senate must act now to move us \n     closer to achieving and preserving an economically and \n     environmentally sustainable water resources development \n     program for the nation's future.\n           Sincerely,\n         Agricultural Retailers Association; AGC of St. Louis; Ag \n           Processing Inc.; Agribusiness Association of Iowa; \n           Agriculture Ocean Transportation Coalition; \n           AGRIServices of Brunswick, LLC; Agrium; All American \n           Coop; Alter Barge Line; Ameren; American Association of \n           Port Authorities; American Association of State Highway \n           and Transportation Officials (AASHTO); American Farm \n           Bureau Federation; American Feed Industry Association; \n           American Public Works Association; American Shore and \n           Beach Preservation Association; American Soybean \n           Association; American Waterways Operators, Inc.; Aon \n           Risk Services; Arch Coal, Inc.; Arkansas Basin \n           Development Association; Arkansas Waterways \n           Association; Arkansas Waterways Commission; The \n           Associated General Contractors of America.\n         Association of California Water Agencies; Association of \n           Equipment Manufacturers; Association of Marina \n           Industries; Association of Ship Brokers and Agents \n           (U.S.A.), Inc.; Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway \n           Association; Bay Planning Coalition (San Francisco Bay-\n           Delta); Ben C.

Mr. President, anybody who wants to know if this is broadly \nbased can look at the list of all of these groups. As I said, they \ninclude environmental, labor, agriculture, chambers of commerce, \nconstruction, energy, local entities. MARC 2000 in my State has been a \nvery strong supporter.\n  I thank all of these people who support the bill. I thank my \ncolleagues and their staffs for the hard work devoted to this bill and \nthe difficult issues it presents. I particularly thank Chairman Inhofe \nfor his forbearance. I look forward to the debate on this bill and \nfinal passage.\n  I hope my colleagues listen carefully to the debate because we have \nincluded significant Corps reform that will achieve all the benefits \nthat legitimate requests for Corps reform entail, but it will not \nsubject the process to unending, wasteful delays and further redtape \nthat sank the bill the last time we tried to send it to the House.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized \nfor 4 minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and ranking member \nand the Senator from Michigan for providing me this opportunity to \nspeak for a few minutes about the importance of this legislation to my \nState.\n  As many know, the State of Pennsylvania over the last several weeks \nhas experienced catastrophic floods. FEMA has now issued individual \nassistance declarations for 22 of our 67 counties and declarations of \npublic assistance for 24 counties. It could have been a lot worse but \nfor flood control projects that this Congress authorized and approved \nin the WRDA process in the past, particularly the Wyoming Valley levee-\nraising project, which I will address in a moment.\n  I thank the chairman and ranking member for including a provision for \na flood control project for the town of Bloomsburg. It is the only town \nin Pennsylvania. What you see was 25 percent underwater from the \nSusquehanna River just a couple weeks ago. Bloomsburg State University \nis there. It is a beautiful little town. It was completely submerged as \na result of the flash flooding and then the raising of the Susquehanna \nRiver subsequent to the rains. So I appreciate the fact there is a \nflood control project in this legislation for the town of Bloomsburg.\n  In addition, we have had another problem upstream from Bloomsburg, an \narea where we have had a tremendous success, and that is the Wyoming \nValley levee-raising project which is almost completed, but there is an \narea in Wilkes-Barre in particular called Solomon Creek. It is a \ntributary to the Susquehanna River.\n  This picture shows a little bridge that goes over Solomon Creek. This \nbridge is virtually dry most of the time. You can see it is up 12, 14 \nfeet from the bottom. It is a horrible problem in the city of Wilkes-\nBarre. It backs up into the river and causes all sorts of damage in the \ncity of Wilkes-Barre and south Wilkes-Barre right near a hospital which \nis hoping to expand--but will not expand if we can't fix this problem--\nto serve the residents of the area.\n  What I have asked the chairman to do--there is a provision that \nCongressman Kanjorski got into the House WRDA bill which puts this \nflood control project underneath the Wyoming Valley levee-raising \nproject which is authorized for over $400 million. Believe it or not, \nthe levee-raising project came in at well under $400 million, about \n$250 million. So there is room under that cap to bring in this \ntributary which really does need to be fixed to address this major \nflooding problem.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma, when I explained this project to him, said \nhe would support us in conference in making sure this project is \nincluded in the final bill. I will tell you, the people of south \nWilkes-Barre are very pleased to hear tonight that as a result of this \nbill passing, and we get it through conference, the chairman of the \ncommittee will support the Solomon Creek project in conference, which \nwill mean that literally within the next 12 months, we can begin to \nwork on making sure that south Wilkes-Barre doesn't experience this \nkind of tragic flooding in the future.\n  With that, I thank the chairman for his assurance and his support. It \nis deeply appreciated by me and I know by Senator Specter and by the \npeople of Wilkes-Barre.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first, I thank the distinguished \nchairman of this important bill and the ranking member for allowing me \nto speak about a different subject for a few moments. This is a very \nimportant bill which is before the Senate. It is very important to \nMichigan. I very much appreciate all the hard work they have put into \nbringing this bill to the floor.\n  I also thank my friend and colleague from California for allowing me \nto use a few moments of her time.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Stabenow are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I was pleased to yield time to Senator \nStabenow who had a very pressing matter regarding some of her \nconstituents who are stuck in Lebanon with no way out, and a very \nvulnerable time for many of the families in her district and in her \nState.\n  Let me start out by saying thank you to my chairman, Senator Inhofe, \nand to our ranking member, Senator Jeffords, and, of course, Senators \nBond and Baucus, and the array of Senators who have worked so hard on \nthis very bipartisan bill. We have all worked together, and I believe \nit is an excellent bill. I thank the staffs for their commitment to \nthis product, particularly Let Mon Lee with Senator Bond, Angie \nGiancarlo and Stephen Aaron with Senator Inhofe, and Catharine Ransom \nand Jo-Ellen Darcy with Senator Jeffords. They put in very long hours, \nmany of them, to help all of us, and for that I thank them.\n  All together, this bill represents the collective work of nearly 6 \nlong years. That is how long it has taken to get this water resources \nbill to the Senate. I think we all agree that 6 years is far too long \nto wait for a bill that authorizes essential flood control, navigation, \nand ecosystem restoration projects, projects that help protect \nthousands of homes and the lives of millions from catastrophic \nflooding; projects that help restore the great wetlands and the rivers \nof our Nation. What we learned during Katrina is what happens when we \nlose the wetlands in our country, and we have been losing them. As a \nresult of that, we lose the natural flood protection that we so \ndesperately need. So restoring the great wetlands we have lost in \nCalifornia--I think it is about 90 percent of our wetlands, and \nnationwide I think it is even more than that. So we really have lost a \ngreat deal of our wetlands, and this bill helps to correct that. It \nprotects the rivers of our Nation, also very important and is addressed \nhere.\n  We have projects that help increase our port capacity and projects \nthat make shipping easier and safer. Specifically, for my State of \nCalifornia, there are many great and valuable provisions in this bill, \nessential flood control provisions that more than double the amount of \ncurrent funds authorized to improve and upgrade levees in the San \nJoaquin River Delta, levees that\n\n[[Page S7732]]\n\nwill help protect two-thirds of California's water supply.\n  I remind my colleagues--I know you are aware of this--we have almost \n37 million people in my State. So when we talk about flood control \nprotecting the population, we are talking about quite a sizable \npopulation.\n  We have included ecosystem restoration pilot projects to help improve \nand restore the Salton Sea, which has been steadily shrinking into the \ndeserts of southern California. The Salton Sea is a remarkable--\nremarkable--body of water.\n  The bill also includes authorization to restore vast salt marshes and \nwetlands around the Napa River.\n  I want to highlight one final provision in this bill for California. \nEarlier this year, I introduced the Los Angeles River Revitalization \nAct. When I tell my colleagues that there was a river in Los Angeles--\nthere still is--they look at me and say: Well, where is this river?\n  Well, you can take it from me, there is a river. It has been \ndestroyed over time. The local people, with a wonderful project, are \ntrying to restore this river and continue to protect the residents of \nthe area from flooding, but also to provide recreational opportunities \nfor the communities on the riverbanks.\n  The 2006 WRDA bill before us contains key provisions from that bill, \nincluding a feasibility study and provisions authorizing demonstration \nprojects to help get this great restoration effort going. If you have \ntime to come with me to Los Angeles, I say to my colleagues, I will \nshow you the amazing possibilities we have for recreation and for the \nyoung people in an area that is in great need, desperate need of \nrecreation, because it is so populated and so crowded.\n  So in short, Mr. President, this is a great and important bill for my \nState. We cannot ignore our water infrastructure. We learned that from \nHurricane Katrina. We cannot allow long periods of time to elapse \nwithout reauthorizing such a vital and important bill. Most of our \ncolleagues agree, earlier this year, more than 80 Senators signed a \nletter requesting full Senate consideration of this bill. I have worked \nwith colleagues on both sides of the aisle, particularly Senators \nInhofe and Jeffords, in trying to address every colleague's concerns so \nthat we could get to this moment, and here we are.\n  I look forward to discussing and debating several key policy issues \nrelating to this bill. We have a couple of controversial ones, and I \nwill be on the Senate floor as these issues come before us.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4679\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, at this time, I call up my amendment No. \n4679, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4679.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n      (Purpose: To modify the project for Folsom Dam, California)\n\n       Beginning on page 164, strike line 21 and all that follows \n     through page 165, line 5, and insert the following:\n       (b) Folsom Dam.--Section 128(a) of the Energy and Water \n     Development Appropriations Act, 2006 (Public Law 109-103; 119 \n     Stat. 2259), is amended--\n       (1) in the first sentence, by striking ``The Secretary'' \n     and inserting the following:\n       ``(1) In general.--The Secretary'';\n       (2) in the second sentence, by striking ``The Secretaries'' \n     and inserting the following:\n       ``(2) Technical reviews.--The Secretaries'';\n       (3) in the third sentence, by striking ``In developing'' \n     and inserting the following:\n       ``(3) Improvements.--\n       ``(A) In general.--In developing'';\n       (4) in the fourth sentence, by striking ``In conducting'' \n     and inserting the following:\n       ``(B) Use of funds.--In conducting''; and\n       (5) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(4) Project alternative solutions study.--The \n     Secretaries, in cooperation with non-Federal agencies, are \n     directed to expedite their respective activities, including \n     the formulation of all necessary studies and decision \n     documents, in furtherance of the collaborative effort known \n     as the `Project Alternative Solutions Study', as well as \n     planning, engineering, and design, including preparation of \n     plans and specifications, of any features recommended for \n     authorization by the Secretary of the Army under paragraph \n     (6).\n       ``(5) Consolidation of technical reviews and design \n     activities.--The Secretary of the Army shall consolidate \n     technical reviews and design activities for--\n       ``(A) the project for flood damage reduction authorized by \n     section 101(a)(6) of the Water Resources Development Act of \n     1999 (113 Stat. 274); and\n       ``(B) the project for flood damage reduction, dam safety, \n     and environmental restoration authorized by sections 128 and \n     134 of the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, \n     2004 (117 Stat. 1838, 1842).\n       ``(6) Report.--The recommendations of the Secretary of the \n     Army, along with the views of the Secretary of the Interior \n     and relevant non-Federal agencies resulting from the \n     activities directed in paragraphs (4) and (5), shall be \n     forwarded to the Committee on Environment and Public Works of \n     the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and \n     Infrastructure of the House of Representatives by not later \n     than June 30, 2007, and shall provide status reports by not \n     later than September 30, 2006, and quarterly thereafter.\n       ``(7) Effect.--Nothing in this section shall be deemed as \n     deauthorizing the full range of project features and \n     parameters of the projects listed in paragraph (5), nor shall \n     it limit any previous authorizations granted by Congress.''.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on Sacramento flood \ncontrol at the Folsom Dam, and I want to speak on behalf of my \namendment. My statement will be brief because I am very pleased that my \namendment has been cleared on both sides of the aisle. Again, I thank \nSenators Inhofe and Jeffords and their staffs. We will be voice-voting \nthis amendment, and it means a great deal to Senator Feinstein and to \nme and the people from California, be they Republicans or Democrats or \nIndependents. I again extend my thanks to Letmon Lee with Senator Bond, \nAngie Giancarlo and Stephen Aaron, Catherine Ransom and Jo-Ellen Darcy. \nI am saying their names again because I think all too often staff just \ndon't get the credit they deserve for the long hours they put in. Their \nwork on this amendment, like so many others in this bill, has been \ninvaluable.\n  I thank Senator Feinstein for being a cosponsor of this amendment. I \noffer my appreciation for her help in this effort. Very briefly, I want \nto talk about why this amendment is so important, and then we will have \na voice vote and we can move on to Senator Specter's amendment.\n  Sacramento is one of America's largest metropolitan areas that has \nless than 100-year flood protection, less than 100-year flood control \nprotection. The Sacramento-American Rivers floodplain contains 165,000 \nhomes--I want my colleagues to think about that--nearly 500,000 \nresidents, the State Capitol is there, and many businesses providing \n200,000 jobs. It is also the hub of the six-county regional economy, \nproviding hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n  A major flood would cripple the Sacramento region's economy, \nsignificantly impair the operations of our government in Sacramento, \nand cause up to $15 billion in direct damage and up to $30 billion in \ntotal economic losses, and it would likely result in significant loss \nof life.\n  As the capital of the world's sixth largest economy--the world's \nsixth largest economy--no one can deny it is important to protect the \nSacramento region and, fortunately, no one today is denying that. Yet \nSacramento is terribly vulnerable to catastrophic flooding, so \nvulnerable that parts of the Sacramento area were under serious flood \nthreat earlier this year. I remember well, when Senator Feinstein and I \ncame to the floor and we showed you the pictures. We are not going to \ngo through those again tonight because I think you remember those \npictures. There was that whole area where you have homes below sea \nlevel at risk every single day.\n\n  To protect this region from flooding, Folsom Dam was completed in \n1956. It is located 15 miles northeast of Sacramento on the American \nRiver. To improve the dam's flood control capabilities, Congress \nauthorized two projects to increase the dam's capacity and waterflow \ncontrol. Over the past year, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau \nof Reclamation have been working to refine and improve these plans.\n  My amendment ensures that this important process continues \nexpeditiously and without interruption. This is what it does. It sets a \nstrict timeframe of June 2007 for the Corps and\n\n[[Page S7733]]\n\nthe Bureau to complete their report, so that design work can proceed \nwithout delay.\n  We all know bureaucracy. They will figure out one way to delay and \nanother way to delay, and before long we have real serious questions of \nthe costs for the project and having to pay more for the project. We \npray during that time there will not be a catastrophic flood.\n  We are so pleased that this amendment has been signed off on, on both \nsides. It also calls for quarterly reports on the progress of the \nBureau of Reclamation and the Corps.\n  The bill as agreed to by the managers of the bill today is an \nimportant next step to provide the region of Sacramento the level of \nflood protection it deserves. The Corps, the Bureau, and their non-\nFederal partners are continuing to work on designing the best solution \nfor Folsom Dam, and the outlook is very promising.\n  As S. 728 moves to conference with the other body, I intend to work \nwith my colleagues in any way needed to support this project. Again, I \nthank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for agreeing with this \nimportant amendment, and I hope the day will soon come when we will \nhave that report ready for you and move forward.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all of my time and the time of Senator \nStabenow be charged against my amendment. I think that will clear up \nthe time confusion with the Chair. Is that correct? Mr. Chairman, is \nthat making you happy?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We are done. I hope now we can voice vote this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment by \nSenator Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. This amendment has simple goals: to consolidate some \nongoing work on the Folsom Dam and get the Corps to finish in a timely \nmanner. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, in my opening statement, I talked about \nthe rather difficult process we go through in this WRDA process and the \nCorps of Engineers starting off with a reconnaissance or a recon \nsetting and then going to a feasibility study. I would like to say the \nproject, as discussed by the Senator from California, has already gone \nthrough all this. It has already been authorized twice. So I join her \nin wanting to get this done.\n  I would like to make the comment, though, that at the conclusion of \nthis voice vote, I think we are going to be going to the Specter \namendment. It is the intention of the chairman, anyway, to go ahead and \nhave that as a recorded vote this evening.\n  I support the Boxer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4679) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: We have 1 hour \nequally divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4680\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] for himself and \n     Mr. Carper, proposes an amendment numbered 4680.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To modify a provision relating to Federal hopper dredges)\n\n       Strike section 2020 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 2020. FEDERAL HOPPER DREDGES.\n\n       Section 3(c)(7)(B) of the Act of August 11, 1888 (33 U.S.C. \n     622; 25 Stat. 423), is amended by adding at the end the \n     following: ``This subparagraph shall not apply to the Federal \n     hopper dredges Essayons and Yaquina of the Corps of \n     Engineers.''.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment is to delete a provision \nin the bill which would prohibit the hopper dredge McFarland from \nremaining in operation. I submit this bipartisan amendment on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Carper, of Delaware.\n  It is a little hard to understand why this pending bill seeks to \nretire this vessel, which does important dredging work, on a bill which \nis denominated to provide for the consideration of the development of \nwater and related resources and authorizes the Secretary of the Army to \nconstruct various projects for improvements to rivers and harbors of \nthe United States, because this dredger is very important for the \nspecific stated purposes of the bill.\n  I would start with the important role this dredging vessel, the \nMcFarland, plays with respect to the Nation's military operations. The \nMcFarland is one of only three active dredging vessels owned by the \nU.S. Government, with one other held in reserve. The other two active \nvessels are on the west coast. The McFarland is available to respond \nimmediately to emergency blockages at the Department of Defense-\ndesignated strategic military seaports.\n  At a time when terrorism is a major threat in this country, it is \nhard to understand why we would want to give up the only dredger which \nis available on the east coast and on the gulf coast. I think there may \nbe many Senators whose States will be adversely affected, as will \nPennsylvania and Delaware and New Jersey--the States in our region--\nwhen you take a look at the Defense-designated ``Strategic Military \nSeaports'' within the operating range of the McFarland, which covers \nNew York and New Jersey; Hampton Roads, VA; Morehead City, NC; \nWilmington, NC; Charleston, SC, Savannah, GA; Jacksonville, FL; \nGulfport, MS; Beaumont, TX; Corpus Christi, TX; the Earle Naval Weapons \nStation, NJ and Sunny Point, NC.\n  Senators from those States, beware about what is going to happen to \nyour State if you don't have this dredger available to perform \nstrategic military seaport operations at a time when there is a \nsignificant risk of terrorism.\n  The McFarland has also played a key role in responding to severe \nweather events and natural disasters. Most recently, the vessel was \ndispatched to the gulf coast to assist in Hurricane Katrina response \nefforts. So, Senators of Louisiana and Mississippi and Texas and \nAlabama, beware if this vessel is not available. There are two on the \nwest coast. They can't get to these areas to perform needed rescue \nefforts.\n  There has been no plan put forward to address the void in the \nNation's dredging capacity that will be created in the absence of the \nMcFarland. The GAO has been critical of restricting the Federal hopper \ndredge fleet. It made a finding in a March 2003 report that the \ndecreased utilization of the Federal fleet has imposed additional costs \non the Corps and not produced significant benefits. That is because \nthose in the private sector are on notice, with a Federal dredger \navailable they are not in a position to raise their costs without the \ncompetition that would be supplied by the Federal dredger.\n  It isn't exactly a matter of having a great Federal fleet and looking \nto privatize or looking to help the private sector. You have 15 private \ndredgers, and they are interested in eliminating competition so they \ncan raise the prices.\n  There was a report by the Corps of Engineers on June 3, 2005. That \nreport does not provide sufficient support for its recommendation to \neliminate the McFarland. You would think, if the committee was going to \ncome forward and wanted to eliminate the McFarland, they would have \nsome Federal report with verified data to rely upon, but they do not. \nThe GAO, in 2003, says we ought not eliminate the limited Federal \ndredgers. The Corps of Engineers' report of 2005 doesn't give \nsufficient reasons for what the committee report seeks to accomplish.\n\n[[Page S7734]]\n\n  There has been some suggestion that the McFarland is in need of \nrepairs. That is contrary to fact. That is a scare tactic. The fact is \nthat the McFarland is capable of operating for the next 10 to 12 years \nwithout undergoing any major rehabilitation work. As of March 23 of \nthis year, just a few months ago, it was fully certified by the Coast \nGuard and the American Bureau of Shipping. The McFarland is able to be \ndispatched immediately to these areas.\n  Again, the availability of the McFarland ensures that prices will be \nreasonable when the Corps of Engineers contracts with private industry \nto perform dredge work. If the McFarland were to be decommissioned, \nmaintenance dredging costs on the Atlantic and gulf coast will be \nentirely at the hands of the private dredge industry, and the Corps of \nEngineers' dredging costs will likely increase during peak work \nperiods, when the availability of private bidders is limited.\n  The McFarland facilitates the safe and reliable movement of \ncommercial goods. On the Delaware River alone, the McFarland helps \nmaintain a shipping channel which supports 38 million metric tons of \ncargo per year at a total value of $14 billion--amounts which rank \nsecond and eighth in the Nation respectively. It is a big economic blow \nto my State and a big economic blow to Delaware and a big economic blow \nto New Jersey and a big economic blow to other States to have this \nMcFarland phased out.\n  I am at a loss to see the motivation for the committee to come \nforward with this recommendation and in effect to pick a fight with \nhalf the States in the country. I will be anxious to see what the \ncommittee has by way of argument to justify eliminating the McFarland.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my printed remarks be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to introduce \n     an amendment to the pending bill, along with my colleagues, \n     the Senators from Delaware, regarding the Federal Hopper \n     Dredge McFarland. This amendment would strike language \n     included in the bill to decommission the McFarland within 2 \n     years of enactment. The McFarland is a 300 foot-long, \n     oceangoing hopper dredge crewed by approximately 80 employees \n     of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Philadelphia District. \n     The Federal Government operates a total of four dredges--two \n     on the West Coast and one in ``Ready Reserve'' status on the \n     Gulf Coast. The McFarland is the only ``active'' Federal \n     hopper dredge available to perform critical emergency and \n     maintenance dredging work along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. \n     I am advised that nearly 80 percent of the national hopper \n     dredging workload occurs along these shores, and that no \n     viable plan has been put forth to fill the void in our \n     Nation's dredge capacity if the McFarland were to be \n     decommissioned. Accordingly, I believe that reducing the \n     Federal hopper dredge fleet at this time would be unwise \n     considering its importance to both our national dredging \n     capacity and a maritime industry that relies on prompt, \n     reliable and cost-effective dredge service.\n       I am advised that the recommendation to decommission the \n     McFarland was based on two contentious assertions: that $20 \n     million in major rehabilitation work is required to support \n     the McFarland's continued operation; and that the private \n     dredge industry can perform comparable dredge work at a lower \n     rate than the McFarland. It is my understanding, however, \n     that the McFarland is capable of operating for the next 10-12 \n     years without undergoing any major rehabilitation work. The \n     McFarland has benefitted from routine scheduled servicing and \n     both major and minor overhauls over the past 6 years. The \n     vessel maintains a full oceangoing certification from both \n     the United States Coast Guard as well as the American Bureau \n     of Shipping. I am advised that these inspections are \n     performed on a yearly basis and that the McFarland passed \n     both as recently as March 23, 2006. It is my understanding \n     that no extraordinary funding source nor direct appropriation \n     is required to keep the McFarland operational and available \n     to perform emergency and maintenance dredging along the \n     Atlantic and gulf coasts. Rather, the McFarland can perform \n     dredge work for the remainder of its useful life supported \n     only by a portion of the overall cost of the project on which \n     it is working and routine maintenance.\n       The assertion that private industry can provide comparable \n     dredge service at a lower rate than the McFarland is also \n     questionable. The Corps of Engineers' June 3, 2005 Report to \n     Congress does not sufficiently verify private industry data \n     used to recommend the McFarland's retirement, and there are \n     no assurances that private industry will be able to fill the \n     void created by decommissioning the McFarland. For one, \n     private industry may also not have the capability to respond \n     to dredging requirements in as timely a fashion as the \n     McFarland. Being a Federal dredge, the McFarland is able to \n     be dispatched immediately to respond to emergency situations \n     that occur within its operating range. By contrast, it is my \n     understanding that the bid solicitation and contract award \n     process necessary to dispatch a private dredge typically \n     requires a minimum of 2 weeks. If the McFarland is \n     decommissioned, our national ability to respond to emergency \n     dredging requirements in a timely manner will be jeopardized.\n       Additionally, the cost of dredging contracts could actually \n     increase if the McFarland were decommissioned. I am advised \n     that the mere availability of the McFarland to perform \n     dredging work ensures that costs will be reasonable in \n     times of high demand or when there are limited bids for \n     dredging projects. The McFarland's presence serves as a \n     check to keep private industry pricing in-line on non-\n     Federal dredging contracts. The GAO recognized this in a \n     March 2003 report noting that the decreased utilization of \n     the Federal fleet has imposed additional costs on the \n     Corps and not produced significant benefits. If the \n     McFarland is decommissioned, maintenance dredging costs on \n     the Atlantic and gulf coast will be entirely at the hands \n     of the private dredge industry, and costs will likely \n     increase during peak work periods when limited bidders are \n     available.\n       Further, the McFarland dredges areas that private industry \n     has historically avoided, such as environmental restoration \n     projects which require strict adherence to potentially \n     burdensome guidelines. The McFarland is also available to \n     respond to small jobs which may not be attractive to private \n     industry. Costly shipping delays could occur if private \n     industry declined a dredge job that was economically \n     unattractive, and a Federal fleet must be maintained to \n     ensure the availability of dredge services in such \n     situations.\n       The availability of prompt, cost-effective dredge services \n     on both profitable and non-profitable projects helps ensure \n     the safe and reliable movement of goods coming to and from \n     Atlantic and gulf coast ports. The reliable movement of \n     maritime cargo is vital to the economy and preserving our \n     current dredging capacity is indispensable to maintaining the \n     authorized water depths necessary to support the Nation's \n     commercial navigation activity. Port stakeholders are deeply \n     concerned that costly shipping disruptions could occur if our \n     national dredging capacity is reduced.\n       Reliable, cost-effective dredge service is also very \n     important to the continued success of our Nation's military. \n     The McFarland is available to respond immediately to \n     emergency blockages at Department of Defense-designated \n     ``Strategic Military Seaports'' within its operating range, \n     including Philadelphia, New York/New Jersey, Hampton Roads, \n     Morehead City, Wilmington, Charleston, Savannah, \n     Jacksonville, Gulfport, Beaumont, Corpus Christi, Earle Naval \n     Weapons Station and Sunny Point. Thousands of pieces of \n     military equipment and cargo are shipped to Iraq and depots \n     throughout the Nation from these ports and retaining the \n     existing hopper dredge fleet is essential to ensuring that \n     military cargo arrives at its destination on time.\n       In addition to supporting commercial and military \n     navigation activities, the McFarland plays an important role \n     in responding to severe weather events and natural disasters, \n     including being dispatched to the gulf coast to assist in the \n     Hurricane Katrina response efforts. Seasonal events and \n     natural disasters place great demands on our Nation's already \n     limited dredging capacity. Given the number of weather-\n     related events experienced annually along the Atlantic and \n     gulf coasts, all available dredge resources, including the \n     McFarland, are essential and must be retained. Our Nation's \n     ability to respond to natural disasters and weather-related \n     events will be even more limited if the McFarland is \n     decommissioned.\n       In conclusion, no plan has been put forth to address the \n     void that will be created in the McFarland's absence. Absent \n     a viable plan to replace her dredging capacity, \n     decommissioning the McFarland is dangerously premature and \n     could have devastating impacts on our Nation's commercial, \n     military and emergency response capabilities. The ability of \n     the private dredge industry to replace the services provided \n     by the McFarland at a reasonable rate has not been proved. \n     The continued operation of the McFarland will ensure that \n     emergency and maintenance dredging work on both the Atlantic \n     and gulf coasts remains responsive, reliable and cost-\n     effective. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to adopt this \n     amendment.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am reserving 10 minutes for Senator \nCarper, but I am waiting with interest to see what the chairman of this \ncommittee has to say.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, at this time I will not give my full \nstatement in opposition. I will say I would like, at this point, to \nhave printed in the Record a couple of letters, one from the \nTransportation Institute and the other from the Seafarers International \nUnion of North America, AFL-CIO, both saying essentially the same \nthing; that is, $165 million has been spent for\n\n[[Page S7735]]\n\nhoppers to be able to have modern dredges work in the same areas. The \ncapacity is there to bring the McFarland up to date. It would be, \naccording to the Corps of Engineers, a cost of about $20 million. For \nall these reasons, they oppose it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these two letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     Transportation Institute,\n\n                                  Camp Springs, MD, July 17, 2006.\n     Hon. James M. Jeffords,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Environment & Public \n         Works, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ranking Member Jeffords: The Transportation Institute \n     is of the understanding that the Senate is about to take up \n     consideration of the Energy and Water Resources Act of 2005. \n     We would like to take this opportunity to respectfully \n     request that the Senate reject any attempt that might be \n     offered during floor consideration of this bill that would \n     modify the language contained in Sections 2021 and 563 of the \n     bill.\n       These sections would decommission the 39 year-old Federal \n     dredge McFarland. The Corps of Engineers is in support of the \n     decommissioning, citing the private sector's aggressive $165 \n     million investment in hopper dredge capacity over the past \n     eight years. Moreover, it is our understanding that the Corps \n     of Engineers has calculated an annual savings of some $10 \n     million as a direct result of decommissioning the McFarland. \n     Given the fact that the continued operation of the McFarland \n     would only duplicate existing private sector capacity, it \n     would seem fiscally prudent to take advantage of such a cost-\n     saving opportunity.\n       The Transportation is in strong support of the passage of \n     the Water Resources Development Act of 2005 with the language \n     of Sections 2021 and 563 intact. Passage of this legislation \n     would protect the commercial and environmental interests of \n     our national waterway transportation system while \n     concurrently reflecting the proven capability of our private \n     hopper dredge industry.\n           Sincerely,\n     James L. Henry.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     Seafarers International Union\n\n\n                                             of North America,\n\n                                  Camp Springs, MD, July 16, 2006.\n     Hon. James M. Inhofe, Chairman, Hon. James M. Jeffords, \n       Ranking,\n     Committee on Environment and Public Works, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Inhofe and Ranking Member Jeffords: It is our \n     understanding that the Senate is about to consider S.728, the \n     Energy and Water Resources Development Act of 2005. The \n     Seafarers International Union, along with a broad coalition \n     or union, industry, agriculture, aggregate and other \n     interests, has corresponded with Congress in support of this \n     long overdue legislation critical to maintaining and \n     protecting the commercial and environmental integrity of this \n     vital national transportation system.\n       We would like to take this opportunity to recommend your \n     opposition to any potential amendment that might be offered \n     during floor consideration that would modify the intent of \n     Section 2021 and Section 563 of this bill. This provision, as \n     presently worded, decommissions the 39 year-old Federal \n     hopper dredge McFarland The decommissioning of this dredge \n     has the support of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers citing an \n     anticipated annual savings of $10 million. Furthermore, over \n     the past 8 years, the private sector has invested some $165 \n     million in capital to expand and modernize the private sector \n     hopper dredge fleet. In fact, I participated in the \n     christening ceremony of the SIU-crewed hopper dredge Liberty \n     Island, the newest addition to the Great Lakes Dredge and \n     Dock hopper dredge fleet.\n       In closing, the Seafarers International Union supports \n     passage of the Water Resources Development Act of 2005 with \n     Section 563 fully intact. To do so would be cost effective \n     and entirely appropriate given the private sector's \n     demonstrated hopper dredge capability. Once again, we \n     appreciate the opportunity to comment on this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Michael Sacco.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Could I interrupt just for a moment? I would like at this \npoint to yield a few minutes, whatever time is necessary off of our \ntime, to the Senator from Missouri who has another committee hearing \nand would like to take his time now. Would that be acceptable?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I will be glad to yield to the \ndistinguished Senator from Missouri if I may ask one question that was \nraised by what the Senator from Oklahoma has just said. He has made the \nassertion that it would cost $20 million to bring the McFarland up to \nshape. I ask him, what is the source for that and how does that square \nwith the fact that on March 23 of this year, just a few months ago, the \nMcFarland was fully certified by the Coast Guard and the American \nBureau of Shipping, so that it is in good shape and would require no \nfunding to keep it in operation?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it doesn't need the $20 million to bring \nit up to standard for it to compete. The Corps of Engineers has stated \nthat its operational costs are almost double that of the private sector \ndredging that has been taking place. This has been agreed to by the \nSeafarers International Union of North America. So it is the Corps of \nEngineers that is making that assertion, and it is agreed to by both \nthe Seafarers International Union and the Transportation Institute.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I may make one statement before \nyielding to the Senator from Missouri, that is in direct variance with \na report of the Corps of Engineers on June 3 that did not sufficiently \njustify its recommendation to retire the McFarland. And they found \nfurther that there are no assurances that private industry will be able \nto fill the void created by the decommissioning of McFarland.\n  I yield now to the Senator from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank our chairman and manager of the bill \nfor yielding time. I join him in urging that my colleagues oppose the \namendment to strike the provision to decommission the Hopper Dredge \nMcFarland.\n  As has already been stated, the McFarland is an expensive, 39-year-\nold hopper dredge which costs $79,000 a day to operate, more than \ndouble what a more technologically capable commercial dredge would \ncost. The McFarland imposes a wasteful expenditure of scarce resources \non Corps dredging projects.\n  The Energy and Water bill will provide money for removing asbestos \nfrom the McFarland, another expense we don't need. In addition, it \nneeds between $20 million and $40 million in upgrades to bring its \nsafety and operational efficiency to minimal levels of acceptability in \ncomparison with state-of-the-art private sector dredges.\n  Since 1978 the dredging industry has developed the capability to \nperform the majority of the Corps' dredging work.\n  This came as a result of Public Law 95-269, which directed the \nSecretary of the Army to dredge by contract, if he determines private \nindustry has the capability to do such work and it can be done at \nreasonable prices and in a timely manner.\n  Under the law the Secretary ``shall retain only the minimum federally \nowned fleet'' to ``carry out emergency and national defense work'' and \nmay set aside ``such amount of work as he determines to be reasonably \nnecessary to keep such fleet fully operational . . . for as long as he \ndetermines necessary.''\n  During the last decade the Corps has successfully followed a ``use \nindustry first'' policy.\n  Today's facts: industry is more capable; has provided more than \nreasonable prices; and responds routinely in a timely manner and \nsuccessfully to emergencies.\n  All four government dredges, including the ready reserve dredge \nWheeler, are fully operational.\n  The data does not support the continued operation of the 39-year-old \nMcFarland or spending an additional $20-40 million on its \nmodernization. The vision provided by Congress and implemented by the \nCorps has resulted in a vibrant and competitive marketplace.\n  As the Corps' November 2005 Hopper Dredge Report to Congress points \nout, generally, the combined industry/Corps hopper fleet has been able \nto meet demand.\n  With the January 2006 launching of the hopper dredge Glenn Edwards, \nindustry has added 18 percent additional hopper capacity to the \ncombined Federal/private hopper dredge fleet.\n  With a hopper capacity in excess of 13,000 CY, the Glenn Edwards is \nconfigured to dredge in all deep draft commercial ports in a highly \neffective manner. Therefore, ability to meet the Nation's hopper \ndredging needs has been greatly enhanced since the Corps' Hopper Dredge \nReport to Congress was released.\n  Industry by and large does most of its work for the Corps under \ncontract.\n\n[[Page S7736]]\n\nTherefore, if an emergency arises and industry dredges are all working, \nthe Corps has the ability to reassign a private dredge working \nelsewhere under Corps contract to do an emergency dredging job.\n  Most of the dredging requirements on the Delaware River, particularly \nin the upper reaches near Philadelphia and Wilmington, can be \naccomplished through the use of nonhopper dredges. In fact, it is more \nefficient to dredge with a nonhopper dredge in the case of the \nMcFarland because material must be pumped out of the hopper by private \npumping equipment in the upper reaches of the Delaware River.\n  The Corps hopper dredge Wheeler was placed in ``Ready Reserve'' by \nthe Congress in WRDA in 1996 as insurance that a hopper dredge would be \navailable to respond to urgent and emergency dredging needs in the \ngulf, on the Mississippi River, and on the east coast.\n  The Wheeler has actually been used on the east coast to respond to \nemergencies when a private hopper dredge is not available. Therefore, \nthe Wheeler is working exactly as Congress intended--as insurance for \nuse during emergencies.\n  We should be looking for ways to make the operation of our major \nactivities more efficient by using private sector facilities where they \ncan be done more reasonably and more effectively rather than spending \nlarge amounts of Federal dollars just to keep the dredge in operational \ncapability. Paying a very high charge for it every day when there are \nbetter rates available warrants the recommendation in the WRDA bill \nthat we decommission the Hopper Dredge McFarland.\n  I urge my colleagues not to support the striking motion.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, by way of brief reply to the comments of \nthe Senator from Missouri, the Corps of Engineers has put a $20 million \nfigure for putting the McFarland into Ready Reserve. But that doesn't \ndeal with having the McFarland operational. That estimate was disputed \nby the Maritime Exchange for the Delaware River and others presenting \nfactual information.\n  I have just checked to find out if there was any hearing held on this \nmatter. But I am advised that there was not. The rest of the Corps of \nEngineers report did not provide assurances that private industry would \nbe able to fill the void created by decommissioning the McFarland. When \nyou come to the issue as to whether it is capable of proceeding \noperationally, no one has disputed the facts that the McFarland is \ncapable of functioning for 10 to 12 years without undergoing any major \nrehabilitation work being fully certified by the Coast Guard and the \nAmerican Bureau of Shipping as of March 23 of this year, an undisputed \nfact.\n  How much time remains on my side, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 19 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask if Senator Carper would await the \narguments of the chairman.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me comment.\n  I was asked the question by the Senator from Pennsylvania as to \nclarification on this Army Corps of Engineers report. It was the Energy \nand Water appropriations that made a request of the Corps of Engineers \non June 3, 2005. The Corps report states:\n\n       From the above discussion, the most reasonable option would \n     be to retire the McFarland.\n\n  It goes on to state:\n\n       It is expected that sufficient industry hopper dredging \n     capability exists to perform the requirements that may occur \n     on the Delaware River.\n\n  Finally, it states:\n\n       McFarland would have to be rehabilitated and repowered at \n     the cost of approximately $20 million.\n\n  It says that on page 22 of the report.\n  I will go ahead.\n  I ask the Senator from Delaware to take his time and I will elaborate \na little bit more on this on my time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the argument that the Senator from \nOklahoma makes about a 2005 report by the Corps of Engineers is flatly \ncontradicted by the certification by the Coast Guard and the American \nBureau of Shipping as of March 23, 2006, after the 2005 report referred \nto by the Senator from Oklahoma, that the McFarland requires no \nrehabilitation and remains operational and available to perform dredge \nwork.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Specter, one, for yielding \ntime, and, second, I thank him for offering an amendment to give me an \nopportunity to join him in offering this amendment.\n  Before I get to my remarks, for folks who are listening to the debate \ntonight, it might be confusing. There is a question as to whether this \ndredge called the McFarland is seaworthy. There is a question about \nwhether the enormous investment--as much as $20 million--is required \nfor it to be seaworthy or to become seaworthy or remain seaworthy. This \nis the deal.\n  The Coast Guard has said as recently as 4 months ago that the \nMcFarland is seaworthy. There is no suggestion--at least that I am \naware of--on behalf of the Coast Guard that says $20 million or $2 \nmillion has to be spent now or next year to make it continue to be \nseaworthy.\n  The question is, What kind of investments would be needed to be made \nin the McFarland if it were to be transitioned to the Ready Reserve? In \nthat case, I am told that an investment--as much as $20 million--might \nbe needed in order to transition this vessel to the Ready Reserve. We \nare not proposing that the vessel be transitioned to the Ready Reserve. \nWe are simply proposing that it be allowed to continue the work it does \nalong the east coast and not long ago down on the gulf coast as well.\n  I think maybe that is clarifying and maybe a little bit illuminating \nfor some of the people who are listening to this debate on the edge of \ntheir seats to determine the future of the McFarland.\n  The McFarland is based in Philadelphia and is one of the four hopper \ndredges currently owned and operated by the Army Corps of Engineers. It \nis the only Federal dredge stationed on the Atlantic coast.\n  The McFarland is used for maintenance dredging on the Delaware River \nand the Delaware Bay as well as on the east coast and the gulf coast of \nour country. It is also used for emergency and for national defense \ndredging wherever that might be needed.\n  The McFarland has been used to restore navigation after major \nemergencies, such as along the gulf coast after Hurricane Katrina, and \nafter the four hurricanes that hit Florida in 2004. This dredge is also \nutilized when no private dredge is available and no reasonable bid is \nmade by private industry.\n  In 1979, Congress passed a law instructing the Corps to use private \nindustry dredges when industry has the capability to do the work at \nreasonable prices and in a timely manner. Congress also directed the \nCorps to retire Federal dredges when private industry demonstrated the \ncapability to do the work. At the same time, the Corps was charged with \nmaintaining a federally owned fleet to carry out emergency and national \ndefense work.\n  In attempting to balance these responsibilities, the Army Corps \nproduced a report in 2004 calling for the decommissioning of the \nMcFarland dredge, saying that private dredgers had increased their \ncapacity to do the same job for less. But the Corps report was sharply \ncriticized subsequently by the Government Accountability Office for \nflaws in its analysis and its cost estimates.\n  As a result, a new report was produced last year by the Army Corps. \nWhile it still called for the decommissioning of the McFarland, it \nraised several troubling questions about private industry's capacity \nand the Army Corps' ability to respond to emergencies without the \nMcFarland.\n  The report indicated that the Corps' dredge fleet is still sometimes \nneeded, saying ``industry alone has not been able to meet peak \ndemands.''\n  The report goes on further to say that when private capacity is\n\n[[Page S7737]]\n\nstretched, the Corps fleet is needed to protect the taxpayers' dollars \nand ensure reasonable bids. It states:\n\n       With such a limited number of vessels in the fleet, and \n     during peak workload periods when only one bidder may be \n     available, there is a tendency to exercise the principles of \n     supply and demand, and costs will rise. The Corps' presence \n     will serve as a deterrent for potential cost increases.\n\n  Without the McFarland, when private industry is at capacity and \nunable to respond to dredging needs on the east coast, we will have to \nturn to the Wheeler dredge, which is stationed in New Orleans. But this \ndredge is already in high demand. And in recent years, both dredges \nhave been needed to respond to natural emergencies.\n  Emergency situations were considered by the Corps. They looked at a \n``worst case scenario'' in their report, using the 2004 hurricane \nseason as a good example of a worst case scenario. That year, private \nindustry's capacity was stretched and natural disasters created an \nemergency need for still further dredge work.\n  The Army Corps pointed out in their report that the McFarland was \nneeded in 2004 to respond to the four hurricanes that hit Florida. But \nthe report downplayed the likelihood of a worst case scenario occurring \nagain, saying:\n\n       Having four hurricanes in a row with the extent and \n     magnitude of damages experienced is not a common occurrence.\n\n  I wish that were true. Sadly, the following year, demonstrated that \nthe worst Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma case scenario can come in \ndifferent forms. And more active hurricane seasons are predicted to \ncontinue to occur this year, next year, and the year after that.\n  We would all love to believe that this type of disaster will not \nhappen again and that we do not have to plan for that possibility. But \nwe have no choice.\n  Active hurricane seasons should be expected, and we cannot fail to \nclear our navigation channels after a disaster--they are too important \nto our economy and our national security.\n  Finally, the Corps has found that smaller channels and smaller jobs \nsometimes do not attract as many bids from private industry. The Corps \nexpressed concern about this in their report.\n  In discussing the industry's lack of ability to meet peak demands, it \npointed out that private industry may not always have the right kind of \ndredge available to serve a smaller channel.\n  These same concerns can apply to smaller jobs, where it is not cost \neffective to move a private industry dredge to perform the work. In \nfact, without the McFarland, it might not be economical to use the \nremaining federal dredges to respond to such jobs. It could cost as \nmuch to move the Wheeler to the northeast Atlantic coast and back to \nthe gulf as it would cost to operate it for 2 weeks.\n  In this case, it would be more economical to keep the McFarland where \nit is. This way it can be used when there is not enough private dredge \ncapacity to meet the needs along the east coast.\n  We must ensure that we can maintain our waterways and access to our \nports, whether small or large.\n  We should also continue to support the growing private dredge \nindustry. However, we cannot and should not expect private industry to \ndo work that is not profitable or beyond their capacity.\n  Nor can we plan for only the best case scenarios. Recent hurricane \nseasons have proven that we don't have that luxury.\n  To my colleagues, I urge support for this amendment. I thank Senator \nSpecter for offering it. I am pleased, again, to join him in doing so.\n  I yield back whatever time I have not consumed.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Democrat \nmanager of the bill, Senator Jeffords.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Specter-Carper \namendment of the hopper dredge McFarland.\n  The Corps of Engineers maintains a fleet of four hopper dredges, and \naccording to the GAO the Corps needs to maintain its own fleet, even \nwhen there are commercial dredges available.\n  One reason the Corps needs to maintain a hopper dredge fleet is that \nchanges in annual weather patterns and severe weather events, such as \nhurricanes and floods, can create a wide disparity in the demand for \nhopper dredges from year to year.\n  The McFarland is the only hopper dredge on the East coast. If it were \nretired, it is not certain that the needs of the East coast during an \nemergency could be met by the private sector.\n  I support the amendment by Senators Specter and Carper that would \nkeep the McFarland in the hopper dredge fleet.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont, the \nranking member of the committee, for those comments.\n  I think he puts his finger on the critical spot. That is, if the \nMcFarland is decommissioned, we may well have a need which will not be \nfulfilled. That was a big hole in the report of the Corps of Engineers \nthat there were no assurances that the private sector would be able to \nhandle the workload.\n  The fact is, as outlined in the report by the Corps of Engineers, the \nCorps' hopper dredges serve to ensure that costs will be reasonable, \nbut with a limited number of vessels in the fleet and during peak \nworkload periods when only one bidder may be available, there is a \ntendency to exercise the principles of supply and demand and costs will \nrise.\n  The Corps' presence will serve as a deterrent for potential cost \nincreases. That means we need to keep the McFarland in operation.\n  The report goes on to say that a current example is the Wheeler being \ncalled out in February to perform work in the Mississippi River when a \nsingle industry bid exceeded the award amount. The Corps report further \npoints out during the peak workload scenario, the largest industry \nhopper dredge, the Stuyvesant, experienced engine trouble and had to \nstop work, creating a capability shortfall. Subsequent to this event, \nincreased shoaling in the Mobile Harbor created the need for an \nadditional hopper dredge resulting in calling out the Wheeler, as the \nMcFarland was also fully engaged.\n  When there has been talk about the daily rate of the McFarland, it is \nunsupported by the fine print. The McFarland's estimated daily rate \nincludes a payment the Corps has to make into a ``dredge replacement \nfund'' even though the Corps has no intention of replacing the \nMcFarland with another federal dredge. Therefore, the daily rate which \nhas been cited is inflated, unrealistic, and does not support \ndecommissioning the McFarland.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I know no Senator on this floor would \nmisrepresent the facts in a case like this. We have an opportunity with \nan agreed-to provision of our bill, which I thought we all agreed to, \nthat we are able to save a lot of money and finally put this thing to \nrest.\n  Every year we go through this same exercise. Everyone wants to keep \nthis old relic called the McFarland. I cannot figure out for the life \nof me why they want to do it other than the fact maybe this is some \nkind of an emotional institution that exists that we want to hold on \nto. If that is the case, maybe we should let the Historical Society \nhave that and they can see what dredging used to be like in the old \ndays.\n  The McFarland is the oldest and most expensive hopper dredge owned \nand operated by the Corps. The Corps did a study in the hopper fleet \nand concluded that the McFarland should be retired. The WRDA bill does \nthat. The pending amendment would prevent the retirement of the \nMcFarland.\n  The Corps found the McFarland operates at almost double the daily \ncost of a private-sector dredge, and there is sufficient private dredge \ncapacity to cover the work of the McFarland.\n  Proponents of keeping the McFarland in service argue that it is \nnecessary for two main reasons. No. 1, to keep the Delaware River free \nfrom navigational hazards and to be ready for emergency dredging. Both \nare incorrect.\n  The Corps found they have more than enough capacity to handle dredge \nfor\n\n[[Page S7738]]\n\nthe Delaware River. Private dredges currently do over 80 percent of the \ndredging in the McFarland service area and still have idle capacity. \nThe McFarland is the wrong type of dredge for much of the work on the \nDelaware.\n  The Corps and private industry have an agreement whereby the Corps \ncan pull any private dredge off of any Corps project to send to an \nemergency. Since this agreement, the McFarland has not done any \nemergency work on the Delaware. Not only is the McFarland dramatically \nmore expensive to operate than the private dredges, its age \nnecessitates a rehabilitation that would cost over $20 million to \nremain in service. Even after updating, it would still be far more \nexpensive to operate than those private dredges.\n  Since 1978, Corps policy has been to use industry first. This policy \nhas been very successful. We need to retire this inefficient dredge. It \nwill save the taxpayers a lot of dollars and get the Government out of \nthe business of competing with the private sector.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this effort to retain the McFarland is \nnot being undertaken for historical reasons. To talk about placing the \nMcFarland in a museum is making light of an issue which is very, very \nserious for my State. It is potentially serious for about two-thirds of \nthe other States in the United States which are affected by hurricanes \nand which have very important national security areas.\n  This amendment is being pursued at the request of the Governor of \nPennsylvania and the Maritime Exchange. They are deadly serious about \nthe adverse impact of retiring the McFarland.\n  On the Delaware River alone the McFarland helps maintain a shipping \nchannel that supports 38 million metric tons of cargo per year, a total \nvalue of $14 million. That ranks second and eighth in the Nation.\n  We are not talking about a museum piece. We are talking about a \ndredge which is vital for jobs and the economy of the region. We are \ntalking about the McFarland's availability to respond to emergency \nblockades at the Department of Defense designated strategic military \nseaports. You are not talking about an antique. You are talking about \nan era where terrorism is an ongoing threat; where, within the past 2 \nweeks, we had a threat by terrorists to blow up the Holland Tunnel; \nwhere the President has a terrorist surveillance program which has \nsuperseded the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and is viewed \nunder the President's article II powers as a wartime precedent because \nof the threat of terrorism.\n  We are talking about Department of Defense interests in New Jersey, \nVirginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, \nMississippi, and Texas. We are talking about a dredge which played a \nkey role in responding to severe weather events and natural disasters \nand was dispatched to the gulf coast to assist in Hurricane Katrina.\n  We have a report by the Corps of Engineers which relies upon industry \ndata. The Corps report concedes that ``to verify the industry data \nwould require extensive auditing and is beyond the scope or need of \nthis report.''\n  Beyond the scope of the report; we ought to rely on a Corps of \nEngineers report that relies upon industry data where the industry has \na vested interest in having the McFarland retired so they can make more \nmoney, and you have a national defense interest?\n  There has been no case made by the committee to replace the \nMcFarland.\n  How much time remains on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The Senator has 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have listened to these arguments. We \nkeep going back and refuting the arguments. We have it documented. \nThere is no question about that.\n  As far as the national security ramifications are concerned, I tell \nmy good friend from Pennsylvania I have served for 20 years either on \nthe House or the Senate Committee on Armed Services and I have watched \nthese things very carefully.\n  The Senator has mentioned San Diego and San Francisco, all these \nareas for national security purposes.\n  I suggest to my good friend from Pennsylvania that these do not use \nthe Corps dredges. They use private-sector dredges in these areas, in \nall of them you mentioned.\n  Again, going back to the arguments, as I quoted from institutions \nsuch as the Transportation Institute and the Seafarers International \nUnion of North America, AFL-CIO, they all say the same thing, which I \ncould repeat as many times as we need to tonight--and I have quite a \nbit of time left, so I guess I could do it several times--that it would \ntake $20 million or so to refurbish this thing, to get it so it can \noperate.\n  The report that was quoted by the Senator from Pennsylvania of the \nAmerican Bureau of Shipping, that was, as I understand it, only \nreferring to the hull, that the hull has some problems and that the \nhull is not cracked. So again, I just repeat these arguments, as I have \ndone before.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I did not refer to San Francisco and I \ndid not refer to San Diego. The long list of States affected were on \nthe east coast and on the gulf. There are two other Federal dredgers on \nthe west coast.\n  I have great respect for the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma and \nhis 20 years of service on the Armed Services Committee. But I have \nbeen, for 26 years, on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee and have \nsome familiarity with these issues. I was on the Intelligence Committee \nfor 8 years and chaired it in the 104th Congress and have some \nappreciation of the problems of terrorism. And I have served on the \nJudiciary Committee for 26 years, now chair it, and have been very \ndeeply involved in the President's electronics surveillance program \nwhich has superseded the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act because \nof the threat of terrorism.\n  We are talking here about having the McFarland available in many, \nmany ports and in many, many States--not the State of California and \nSan Francisco or San Diego, but in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, \nVirginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Texas, and \nothers; and the gulf coast States affected by the hurricane, again, \nTexas and Louisiana and Mississippi and Alabama and Florida.\n  We are dealing here with a very flimsy Corps of Engineers report \nwhich is based on industry data which is not verified--a concession \nthey make in this report. And it is provided by industry sources which \nhave a vested interest and a bias in eliminating the McFarland as a \ncompetitor.\n  Mr. President, I think it is fair to say that if the committee's \npoint on decommissioning the McFarland is to stand, they have a burden \nof proof. And they have not established it. There has not been a \nhearing on this subject. There has not been reliable evidence. And I \nwould say that in the face of the threat of terrorism, and the work \nthat the McFarland does in that area, and the work that the McFarland \ndid in Hurricane Katrina, that their burden of proof is more than a \npreponderance of the evidence; it ought to be clear and convincing. And \nit has not been either clear or convincing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my understanding that his time has \nexpired. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma has 16 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I will just take a couple minutes.\n  Let me say, if the argument is that it is the industry influencing \nthese reports, I think it is rather strange that the Seafarers \nInternational Union of North America, the AFL-CIO, are the ones that \nagree with this report and strongly recommend that we vote against this \namendment to keep us from retiring this--as I referred to several \ntimes--this relic.\n  Now, the Senator has a couple of arguments I had not responded to. \nOne was he states that it went down and performed some type of a \nfunction in Katrina. It is my information they took it down to Katrina, \nbut it would not work, so they used it as an office.\n  As far as the ``flimsy'' report is concerned, I do not think I have \nactually\n\n[[Page S7739]]\n\nread from the report, but this says this is in response to the Energy \nand Water appropriations bill. They requested the Corps of Engineers to \nclear this up so once and for all we can get rid of this relic. This \nwas June 3 of 2005. They said, reading from that report:\n\n       [I]t is expected that sufficient industry hopper dredge \n     capability exists to perform the requirements. . . .\n\n  It further says:\n\n       Even if the scheduled work for the McFarland were \n     maximized, the reduction in daily rate would still be almost \n     double the daily rate of a comparable industry hopper dredge. \n     . . .the McFarland is the oldest dredge in the fleet, and \n     operates at a daily rate that substantially exceeds \n     comparable industry medium class hopper dredges. If the \n     McFarland were to be kept in the Minimum Fleet it would have \n     to be rehabilitated and repowered at a cost of approximately \n     $20 million.\n\n  So what you are saying is, you want to spend public funds of $20 \nmillion more to get something to compete with the private sector, that \ncosts twice as much to operate as the private sector. I think this is \nabsurd. I think we have been trying to do this for a number of years.\n  Now, we have the labor unions joining other interests in saying that \nwe need to get rid of this thing and start saving money in our \ndredging.

Mr. President, this evening I rise to pay tribute to a \ncourageous marine, LCpl Dustin Derga, of Pickerington, OH. Dustin was \nkilled in Iraq while fighting insurgents on May 8, 2005, Mother's Day. \nAfter taking an interest in the military as a child, Dustin served 5\\1/\n2\\ years as a marine, and Operation Iraqi Freedom was to be his final \ndeployment. Sadly, 24-year-old Dustin died just 1 month short of his \nscheduled homecoming.\n  He is survived by his mother Stephanie, his father and stepmother, \nRobert and Marla, sister Kristin, and girlfriend Kristin Earhart.\n  A 1999 graduate of Pickerington High School, Dustin went on to attend \nColumbus State Community College, where he pursued a degree in EMS and \nfire science. He also served his community by working as a firefighter.\n  Robert Derga shared these words about his son:\n\n       Dustin was a great pitcher and could play just about any \n     position. He loved to play catcher, which was unusual. I \n     remember all the weekends we would go out to the ball \n     diamonds and watch him play ball. We really enjoyed that. He \n     loved working with his hands. He just loved doing things and \n     getting his elbows dirty.\n\n  Friends describe Dustin as fun-loving and said he was always trying \nto make others laugh. His father recalled that:\n\n       Dustin had a wonderful, fun personality. When you first met \n     him, he seemed quiet and somewhat reserved--at least he let \n     you think that. But once he got to know you, he would reveal \n     that he is a practical joker at heart and the life of the \n     party. He always had a great smile on his face. All the guys \n     in Dustin's unit said he was always making them laugh.\n\n  Laura Giller of Pickerington said this about Dustin:\n\n       Dustin was my friend, and I always enjoyed seeing his face \n     wherever I went. I worked with him, and whenever he was \n     there, it made the day that much better. He always told the \n     silliest jokes. I will never forget the friendship that \n     Dustin gave me. Thank God for men like him.\n\n  Erik Mellquist, another hometown friend of Dustin's, wrote the \nfollowing on an Internet tribute site:\n\n       Dustin was a great guy. I remember laughing constantly \n     during cub scouts and little league baseball whenever Dustin \n     was around. Thank you for sharing him with the rest of us.\n\n  Friends also emphasized Dustin's loyalty to the Marines. Fellow \nreservist Jeff Schmitz of Pickerington commented:\n\n       I saw Dustin around the Reserve Center on drill weekends. \n     He was a great Marine and an even better human being. He will \n     be greatly missed.\n\n  Retired marine Mike Hamilton added:\n\n       Dustin was a friend and fellow firefighter here in \n     Baltimore, OH. I used to kid him about being too small to be \n     a marine. He would set me straight, and then we would discuss \n     the differences between the new Marine Corps he was in and \n     the old one I was in. We both loved the Corps.\n\n  Dustin's loyalty to his military service was also apparent to his \nfamily and to those with whom he served. Robert said that his son ``had \na passion for the Corps and was proud to be a Marine. Dustin really \nrespected his brothers in the unit and he tried to have a good time \nwith his comrades, even under the worst of conditions.''\n  Dustin's girlfriend Kristin wrote:\n\n       Dustin was a great man. I wish everyone would have been \n     given the opportunity to know him. He was my world, my heart, \n     and my soul. His smile would make your heart melt. He was \n     so honored to be a part of the U.S. Marine Corps and \n     defend every last one of us.\n\n  A friend named Martin shared the following memories of Dustin, and \nalso his good friend, Nick Erdy, a fellow marine who died 3 days after \nDustin. This is what his friend, Martin, said:\n\n       Derga and Erdy were some of the first guys I got to know \n     when I joined the unit. They were all about having fun and \n     enjoying life. Even in Iraq, they seemed to make the worst \n     situations turn into great ones. Their character is what made \n     our platoon what it was. We were full of jokes, laughter, and \n     memorable experiences. The first platoon will never be the \n     same without them and the others that we lost. They were \n     great guys, and they will be remembered in our hearts \n     forever. They will never be forgotten.\n\n  Upon returning from Iraq, Dustin planned to finish college and use \nhis savings to buy a new truck. In one of his last notes home he wrote:\n\n       I miss everyone a lot and can't wait to get home and go on \n     maybe three vacations. I look forward to one vacation in \n     particular.\n\n  He and his girlfriend Kristen had been planning on taking a vacation \nwith his friend Nick Erdy and his fiance Ashley Boots.\n  Ashley said they just wanted to go somewhere fun to relax. These \nplans, of course, came to a tragic end when both\n\n[[Page S7740]]\n\nmen died within 3 days of each other in Iraq.\n  After their deaths, Kristen wrote:\n\n       I just wish we could have had the chance to continue our \n     lives the way we planned, but at least you are with Erdy. And \n     don't worry, Ashley and I will never forget you two.\n\n  Nor will the rest of us forget the brave sacrifices made by these \nfine young men. My wife Fran and I continue to keep the family of \nDustin Derga in our thoughts and in our prayers.\n\n\n                              Edward Seitz\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute this evening to a brave \nOhioan who lost his life while protecting the U.S. State Department \npersonnel in Iraq. Edward Seitz was the first U.S. diplomat to be \nkilled in Iraq since Operation Iraqi Freedom began in March 2003. He \ndied on October 24, 2004, after a mortar shell struck him in the Green \nZone in Camp Victory. He was 41 years old.\n  Ed grew up in Garfield Heights and in Brecksville, OH. He graduated \nfrom Holy Name High School in 1981 where he was on the wrestling team \nand then went on to Baldwin-Wallace College. Edward leaves behind his \nwife Joyce, his parents Elroy and Alba, a brother William, and a \nsister-in-law Colleen.\n  Colleen described her brother-in-law as ``a large man with a John \nWayne kind of figure whose trademark outfit included a vest, button \ndown shirt, boots, and felt hat.''\n  He was sent to Baghdad for a 1-year assignment with the State \nDepartment's Bureau of Diplomatic Security, which is the State \nDepartment's security unit. William said that his brother's work was \nhis life. I continue to quote:\n\n       He did what he could to protect this country and to keep \n     terrorism from your front door. He was 100 percent into the \n     government and 100 percent into doing what he wanted to do to \n     defeat terrorism. That's what he did and how he did it. \n     That's what he gave his life for. That's what made him Eddy. \n     That's what made him my brother.\n\n  Colleen echoed her husband's sentiments by saying:\n\n       Ed was just an amazing man. There was just nothing that he \n     wouldn't do for someone. Every time he'd get on the phone, \n     he'd say: What can I do for you? What do you need? What can I \n     help with? That's just the way he was, and that's just \n     what he was trying to do there.\n\n  I would like to read portions of the remarks that Joe D. Morton, the \nDirector of the Diplomatic Security Service, gave at Ed's funeral \nbecause I find it particularly telling of Ed's life and values, and \ndescriptive of his life and values:\n\n       In 16-plus years of service with the Department of State \n     and the Diplomatic Security Service, Ed's strength and \n     character and his dedication to family and to this \n     organization were his hallmarks. His work was nothing short \n     of magnificent. He accepted every challenge willingly and \n     always performed with an unmatched level of excellence. Ed \n     took on some of the most important missions throughout his \n     career. Ed protected Secretaries of State and other foreign \n     dignitaries so that they could conduct their business safely \n     and securely in the hope of bringing peace and stability to \n     troubled regions of the world.\n       Not only was Ed an exceptional agent, but he was an \n     exceptional person as well. In an organization where so many \n     interactions and personal contacts are short-lived by \n     reassignments and the transient nature of the profession, the \n     depths of personal friendships and length of time of the \n     friendships Ed developed are quite remarkable. Ed's \n     classmates from his basic agent training days unanimously \n     remember Ed's caring and unselfish dedication to his \n     colleagues and the organization. Ed would always be looking \n     out for the welfare and safety of his fellow agents. Ed's \n     first words to a person were, What can I do to help? He was \n     always attending to the needs of his colleagues. No request \n     was beyond the realm of possibility.\n       Once, in the midst of a particularly grueling trip, Ed \n     literally gave another agent the shirt he was wearing so that \n     agent could attend a senior level meeting. It is all these \n     memories that stay with us forever.\n       Shortly after receiving word of Ed's death, the consulate \n     in Shenyang held a memorial service in Ed's honor. The \n     outpouring of emotions from those who worked with Ed and from \n     those whose lives were touched by Ed, even after several \n     years had passed, are a tremendous tribute to Ed's character \n     and personality. His dedication to his profession is only \n     outmatched by his devotion to his family.\n       Several years ago, when Ed and another agent were meeting \n     in Ed's hotel room, the agent noticed a wedding photo in the \n     room. When asked about it, Ed replied that it was a wedding \n     photo of his parents and he took it with him wherever he \n     traveled.\n       Ed's life was complete when he met his wife Joyce in Yemen. \n     Their friends unanimously note that Joyce was Ed's perfect \n     match. Ed was never happier than when he was with Joyce.\n\n  Again, those were the words of Joe Morton, the Director of the \nDiplomatic Security Service. I feel they perfectly capture what Ed \nstood for and what he fought for.\n  I would like to close by reading a poem written by one of Ed's \ncousins entitled ``The Third Tour.'' This is the poem:\n\n     The tower fell in Baghdad today.\n     Unlike the World Trade Center's Twin Towers, this tower is \n           not made of concrete and glass.\n     This structure was formed with the steel of conviction.\n     Each element, riveted with the strength of brotherhood.\n     Larger than life was Eddy, a tower built not of man, but \n           created by God.\n     A tower of a man to stand between terror and calm.\n     A friend and relative to be proud of. We all felt safer, \n           somehow, knowing you were there.\n     We prayed for you and an end to the conflict.\n     A clink of the glass to celebrate a tower of a man.\n\n  Mr. President, this tower of a man, Edward Seitz, will indeed be \ndearly missed by his family and friends here at home, as well as those \nindividuals whose lives he touched overseas. My wife Fran and I will \ncontinue to keep him and his family in our prayers.\n\n\n                STAFF SERGEANT ROGER CLINTON TURNER, JR.\n\n  Mr. President, I today pay tribute to a fine soldier and fellow \nOhioan. SSG Roger Clinton Turner, Jr.--``Clinton'' as he was known--\nlost his life while serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was killed \nFebruary 1, 2004 when the sleeping area of his base camp came under \nmortar fire. Clinton was 37 years-old.\n  When I think about the sacrifices our men and women in uniform and \ntheir families make in the service of our Nation, I am reminded of \nsomething President Ronald Reagan said about the strength of the \nAmerican people. He said,\n\n       Putting people first has always been America's secret \n     weapon. It's the way we've kept the spirit of our revolutions \n     alive--a spirit that drives us to dream and dare, and take \n     risks for the greater good.\n\n  Clinton embodies the spirit President Reagan describes. He dedicated \nhis life to military service and risked his well-being to bring freedom \nto the Iraqi people. Clinton excelled in his military career--but more \nimportantly, he excelled as a son, husband, and father.\n  Clinton was born in Elgin, IL, but moved with his family to Ohio when \nhe was 8 years old. At a young age, Clinton's mother Dottie recognized \nher son's artistic talent. She remembers how he loved to sketch and \nact, in addition to his other hobbies of reading comic books and \nplaying video games.\n  Clinton attended Meigs High School in Pomeroy, OH, where he \ncultivated his love for the stage. He starred in several theatrical \nproductions as a member of the school's drama club, including roles as \nEbenezer Scrooge in ``A Christmas Carol'' and Ralph Malph in ``Happy \nDays.''\n  Celia McCoy, a drama teacher at Meigs High School, had Clinton in \nseveral classes and remembers his role as Sam Smalley in \n``Crosspatch.'' She considered that role a difficult one because it was \nthe opposite of Clinton's natural personality--Smalley was crude, \nwhereas Clinton could not have been a nicer kid. Celia stated, ``A lot \nof high school students would have been intimidated to play this role, \nbut not Clinton.''\n  In addition to his acting talents, Clinton was known by both teachers \nand students as a great guy to be around. Clinton's younger sister, \nCharmele Spradling, described him as the ``class clown'' who loved to \nlaugh. ``He was definitely a character,'' she said. ``He had a very \ngood sense of humor, was a good student, and a very bright young man.''\n  After winning several acting awards in high school, Clinton enrolled \nat Ohio University as a theatre major. A little more than a year later, \nhowever, Clinton did what most college students do. He changed his \nmajor--to elementary education. This would not be the last major change \nhe would announce to his mother.\n  While a student at Ohio University, Clinton served in the National \nGuard and found that he enjoyed military life. So much so that he \nwanted to make it a career. He also found the love of his\n\n[[Page S7741]]\n\nlife--his future wife, Teresa. Clinton's mother Dottie vividly \nremembers the phone call when her son laid out his life plan. She \nrecalls, ``He called and asked if I was sitting down one day. Then, all \nin one breath he said he was quitting school, enlisting in the Navy, \nand getting married. I did sit down!''\n  Clinton served in the United States Navy for five years and was \ndeployed during Operation Desert Storm, where he served as a radar man. \nAfter returning from Desert Storm Clinton changed service branches and \nenlisted in the Army. In total, Clinton dedicated 19 years of his life \nin service to our Nation.\n  More than a career serviceman, however, Clinton was a great dad. He \nand his wife Teresa considered their greatest accomplishments to be \ntheir son Steven and daughter Tabitha. Clinton's sister Denise \nremembers him as ``a playful father to his children.'' Though he did \nnot like to leave his family, Clinton was committed to his country and \nwent to Iraq when his unit was called.\n  As a supervisor for an armored tank repair unit with the 10th Cavalry \nRegiment, 4th Infantry Division, based out of Fort Hood, TX, Clinton \nhad been in Iraq since the start of military operations there. He was \nstationed at a base in Balad, Iraq, 50 miles south of the Division's \nheadquarters in Tikrit. Military officials reported that Clinton was \nkilled when the sleeping area of his base camp came under mortar fire. \nHe was evacuated to a combat support hospital, where he died from his \ninjuries.\n  On that day, our Nation lost a great soldier. Teresa lost her \nhusband; Steven and Tabitha lost their father; Denise, Charmele Monica, \nand Katrina lost their brother; and Dottie lost her son. Dottie says \nshe will always remember Clinton as ``a devoted family man and a \ndevoted military man who was proud to serve his country. He was a good \nson who was never in trouble. This is the way I want my son to be \nremembered. He loved his family and he loved his country. I think \nthat's the greatest thing you can say about anybody.''\n  At the service held in his honor, the Reverend William Williamson \ndelivered a statement from Clinton's wife Teresa, which read, ``Every \ntime there is a smiling child's face in Iraq . . . it's because you \nmade the sacrifice.''\n  SSG Roger Clinton Turner paid the ultimate sacrifice in the service \nof our Nation and for the Iraqi people. I know that he will live on in \nthe hearts and minds of all those who had the privilege of knowing him. \nMy wife, Fran, and I continue to keep Clinton's family and friends in \nour thoughts and prayers.\n\n\n                      army sergeant bryan w. large\n\n  Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a courageous soldier in the war \non terror, Army SGT Bryan Large of Cuyahoga Falls, OH. Bryan was killed \nby a roadside bomb in Iraq on October 3, 2005 during his third tour of \nduty. Having joined the Army after the September 11th terrorist \nattacks, Bryan served in Afghanistan in 2003 and in Iraq in 2004. A \nloving father to 14-year-old daughter Devan and 10-year-old daughter \nKylie, Bryan is also survived by his mother Linda, father Larry, sister \nMichelle, and girlfriend Heather Bigalow.\n  Everyone who knew Bryan emphasized his devotion to his daughters. His \nAunt Cybil stressed the many different roles that Bryan fulfilled:\n\n       He was an outstanding soldier, treasured grandson, devoted \n     son and dad; but he was most proud of his role as a father.\n\n  Joshua Woods, who was twice deployed with Bryan, said:\n\n       Bryan embodied the principles he preached--love of God, \n     love of family, and love of country. In 25 years, I've never \n     met a man who lived more for his daughters. I've never met a \n     man who lived life as honestly as he did.\n\n  Most importantly, his daughters knew how much they were loved by \ntheir father. At services after his death, Bryan's 10-year-old daughter \nKylie recalled, ``He was a great father and a very good soldier.'' \nFourteen-year-old daughter Devan added, ``He loved doing what he did \nand he loved his daughters.''\n  A 1992 graduate of Cuyahoga Falls High School, Bryan served as a \nSergeant, Paratrooper, and Field Medic with the U.S. Army's 3rd \nBattalion, 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airbourne Division. \nHe was 31 years old when he died.\n  According to Bryan's father Larry, Bryan had his mother's sense of \ncompassion and his father's determination. This combination of \nqualities served Bryan well in his roll as an Army Field Medic. Bryan's \nExecutive Officer during his second tour in Iraq had this to say about \nhim:\n\n       As the company's senior medic, I was always going to him \n     with issues and to ask for help. It didn't take longer that \n     about 10 seconds for me to realize that he was a man who \n     could make things happen . . . I often think how he would \n     have helped a wounded insurgent without hesitation if the \n     situation had arisen.\n\n  Bryan was a selfless individual who always put others ahead of \nhimself. He didn't want his family back home to worry about him and \ntold his mother that he wouldn't be on the front lines and would be \nokay. Even while he was deployed, he tried to keep the morale high \namong his fellow service members. Bryan's colleague, Sergeant William \nFecke wrote:\n\n       Large was a good man, and I had the pleasure of knowing \n     him. He was the kind of guy you just couldn't forget. His \n     sense of humor helped a lot of us get through the day. He \n     will be missed by all of us.\n\n  According to family, Bryan was always willing to try new things. He \ntried to learn how to cook with his sister Michelle, and his specialty \nwas deep-frying turkeys. In his free time, he enjoyed hunting, fishing, \nand working on cars.\n  Fellow soldiers say Bryan often talked about his family and his plans \nfor when he got out of the Army. Sergeant David Bucholz wrote the \nfollowing on a memorial Web site for Bryan:\n\n       I had the pleasure of knowing Sergeant Bryan Large for the \n     biggest part of my military career. He was appointed as the \n     Platoon Sergeant; and, being the natural leader he was, he \n     excelled in the position. Bryan and I were in EMT-1 school \n     together and we often talked of our plans once getting out of \n     the Army. He wanted to be a firefighter and spend time in \n     North Carolina as a volunteer. He had a knack for connecting \n     with people and helping people. I'll never forget the night \n     when I heard that his vehicle was hit. I think he was a \n     closer friend to all that knew him than we could ever \n     realize.\n\n  Bryan also had many close friends and family members back home, which \nwas evidenced by the 800 people who attended his funeral. Hundreds more \nlined the streets to pay their final respects and either saluted or \nheld their hands over their hearts as the funeral procession rolled by. \nBryan's daughter Kylie rolled down her car window during the procession \nand yelled, ``Thank you! God bless you all! Thank you!''\n  Reflecting on the outpouring of community support, Cuyahoga Falls \nMayor Don Robart said, ``One of our own lost his life for our freedom \nand liberty. Today is about rallying around this family and honoring \nthat man.'' During the funeral service, Reverend Thomas Woost \nreflected:\n\n       Today is a day of great pride in who we are as American \n     people, where strangers are standing side by side waving \n     symbols in memory of the man who worked to preserve and \n     protect our country. Today is about freedom, sacrifice, and \n     heroes. Bryan made the ultimate sacrifice for his country. \n     There is no greater love than to die for another.\n\n  This past April 2006, Cuyahoga Falls included a memorial service for \nBryan in their community Arbor Day celebration. The city planted a Fort \nMcNair horse chestnut tree in memory of him. Bryan's family worked with \nthe city to choose that particular type of tree because of its red \nblossoms. Bryan's father Larry observed that as the tree grows with the \npassing years, it will be noticed more and more. ``It's all in Bryan's \nhonor,'' he said. ``He was bigger than life.''\n  His father described Bryan as ``a wonderful father, a wonderful son, \nand a true patriot for our country.'' Indeed, Bryan will be remembered \nas a loving and devoted father, a selfless son, and a compassionate and \ndetermined soldier. My wife Fran and I continue to keep the family of \nBryan Large in our thoughts and prayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/18/senate-section/article/S7741-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7741-S7742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      OHIO FALLEN HEROES MEMORIAL\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, my wife Fran and I recently attended a \nvery moving memorial dedication ceremony in Sunbury, OH, to honor and \nto remember the brave Ohio men and women who have died fighting for our \ncountry in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n[[Page S7742]]\n\n  These courageous service members--with the many faces of Ohio--came \nfrom the smallest villages in our state and from the largest cities. \nSome came from our farms. Some were born here in Ohio and in America. \nOthers came to this state and this country from many, many miles away. \nSome were 18 or 19 years old. Some were in their 40s.\n  Some were Privates and Lance Corporals, while one was a Lieutenant \nColonel. Some joined the military as a result of the September 11 \nattacks, while others planned on a career in the military from their \nyoungest days, marching around as small children in their fathers' \nuniforms. Some had seen a lot out of life, while for others--most of \nthem, really--their lives had just begun.\n  All of them, though, shared something in common. All of them changed \nlives in countless ways, leaving enormous impacts on their families and \ntheir friends and their loved ones. Their absence leaves a gapping \nwhole in the lives of those left behind. And while that makes it very \nhard, we also know that the world is a better place because these brave \nmen and women were a part of it. It is a better place because they \nlived.\n  We are all so very fortunate to have had them in our lives for the \nall too brief time that we did. And for that, we are eternally \ngrateful.\n  We, as citizens, will never be able to repay these Ohioans for their \nservice. We know that when we lose a service member, there is a tear in \nthe fabric that holds us all, as Americans, together, and there really \nis no way to repair that. President Theodore Roosevelt perhaps put it \nbest when he said, ``Their blood and their toil, their endurance and \npatriotism, have made us and all who come after us forever their \ndebtors.''\n  We are, indeed, in their debt.\n  I did not personally know any of these men and women we honored in \nSunbury at that memorial. I did not personally know any of these men \nand women who died in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and men and women who I \nhave come to the floor tonight to honor or who I have come to the floor \non other nights to honor. But I have spoken with many of their \nfamilies. I have talked to many of their friends and comrades, and have \nread a great deal about each one of them. They were all unique--each \nwith their own special story to tell.\n  One Marine worked as a police officer before going to Iraq. He would \nbring disco balls into his police cruiser to make his partner laugh and \nsometimes brought smiley faces into jail to entertain the inmates.\n  Another Marine was in the high school marching band. During one \nfootball game, he forgot his sousaphone and decided to march with the \nonly available instrument in the band room--a banjo.\n  One soldier's parents remember their son following them around the \nhouse at a young age, with his arms out, saying, ``Big hug, big hug.''\n  Another young man was a delegate to Buckeye Boys' State--a \nprestigious honor for high school students.\n  Several enjoyed riding their dirt bikes and fixing up cars. Some \nplayed sports. Some were in drama club. Others liked to play games, \nsuch as Scrabble.\n  Many married their high school sweethearts.\n  All of them made of our lives just a little bit brighter. They made \nus smile. They filled their loved ones' lives with great joy and \nhappiness.\n  The recently dedicated memorial in Sunbury, OH, stands as a moving \ntribute and a lasting testament to these men and women and to their \ncourage, honor, and sacrifice. They have stood tall in the fight \nagainst tyranny, aggression, and terrorism.\n  As John F. Kennedy once said, ``A Nation reveals itself not only by \nthe men [and women] it produces, but also by the men [and women] it \nhonors [and] remembers.'' And that--that is exactly what this memorial \nis all about. It is about honoring and remembering each of these truly \nunique, wonderful souls.\n  Our Nation is proud of these Ohio men and women. They lived their \nlives well--with great purpose and commitment and love of family and \ncountry. And for that, we will never forget them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/18/senate-section/article/S7742-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7742-S7743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                  sergeant major jeffrey a. mclochlin\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave soldier from northern \nIndiana. Jeffrey McLochlin, father of three, died on July 5 in small-\narms fire in Orgun-E, Afghanistan. Jeffrey risked everything to fight \nfor the values Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway \naround the world.\n  A city police officer in Rochester, Jeffrey had been a National \nGuardsman for 19 years. He was training Afghan soldiers in police \ntactics and was on patrol with coalition and Afghan forces when he was \nshot by antigovernment forces. Jeffrey was on his second tour of duty \nand had previously served his country in 2004 on a NATO peacekeeping \nmission in Bosnia-Herzegovina. A proud husband and father, he left \nbehind his wife Nicholle and three children, Darby, 16, Connor, 8, and \nKennedy, 5. Nicholle told a local paper, ``This man was amazing. There \nwill never be another, that's for sure. Eighteen thousand miles away, \nand he called me daily when he could. He did everything he could to be \na good father and a good husband.'' I stand here today to express my \ngratitude for Jeffrey's sacrifice and that of his family and loved \nones.\n  Jeffrey was killed while serving his country in Operation Enduring \nFreedom. He was assigned to Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 2nd \nBattalion, 152nd Infantry Regiment, Army National Guard, Marion, IN. In \naddition to his wife and children, this brave soldier leaves behind his \nparents, Rich and Cindy McLochlin of Rochester.\n  Today, I join Jeffrey's family and friends in mourning his death. \nWhile we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take \npride in the example he set, bravely working at home and abroad to make \nthe world a safer place. It is his courage and strength of character \nthat people will remember when they think of Jeffrey, a memory that \nwill burn brightly during these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Jeffrey was known for his dedication to his family and his love of \ncountry. Today and always, Jeffrey will be remembered by family \nmembers, friends, and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we \nhonor the sacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Jeffrey's sacrifice, \nI am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the \nfamilies of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we \ncannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living \nand dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor \npower to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember \nwhat we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This \nstatement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am \ncertain that the impact of Jeffrey's actions will live on far longer \nthat any record of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Jeffrey McLochlin in the \nofficial record of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and \nfor his profound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When I \nthink about this just cause in which we are engaged and the unfortunate \npain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like \nJeffrey's can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah, who \nsaid, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe \naway tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Jeffrey.\n\n\n                   Army Staff Sergeant Paul S. Pabla\n\n  Mr. President, I also rise today with a heavy heart and deep sense of \ngratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from Fort Wayne. Paul \nS. Pabla, 23 years old, was killed on July 3 by sniper fire in Mosul, \nin northern Iraq. Volunteering for deployment to Iraq, Paul risked \neverything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, \nin a land halfway around the world.\n  Pabla enlisted in the National Guard while still a student at \nHuntington North High School in Huntington, where he graduated in 2000. \nService to others came naturally to Paul, who in high school \nparticipated in church\n\n[[Page S7743]]\n\nyouth mission work in Honduras. In Mosul, he especially enjoyed working \nwith Iraqi children, calling them the ``future of Iraq.'' Pabla was \nremembered by his senior-year English teacher, who told a local news \noutlet, ``I think (enlisting) was something he felt really strongly \nabout. Without question, he knew what he was getting into. He was \nreally a young man with a sense of purpose.'' Paul was deployed to Iraq \nin January of 2006 on his first tour of duty there and had attained the \nrank of staff sergeant.\n  Paul was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. \nHe was assigned to B Battery, 3rd Battalion, 139th Field Artillery \nRegiment, 38th Infantry Division, Army National Guard, Kempton, IN. \nThis brave soldier leaves behind his mother, Lisa Carroll; his father, \nSarvjit Pabla; stepmother, Leticia Pabla; a brother, Neil Pabla; half \nbrother, Nicholas Pabla; as well as numerous other relatives.\n  Today, I join Paul's family and friends in mourning his death. While \nwe struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride \nin the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Paul, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Paul was known for his dedication to his family and his love of \ncountry. Today and always, Paul will be remembered by family members, \nfriends, and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the \nsacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Paul's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of Paul's actions will live on far longer that any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Paul S. Pabla in the official \nrecord of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his \nprofound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace.

Mr. President, I appreciate being able to come to the \nfloor to speak about something of great urgency for people in Michigan \nand all across our country who have family and friends who are trapped \nin Lebanon--and certainly people in Israel as well--as a result of what \nis happening with the violence in the Middle East. We understand those \nAmericans in Israel are able to leave and come home, but we have \nliterally up to 25,000 Americans who are in Lebanon and trapped and \nunable to leave. They are frightened, and family members here are \nworried about their families in desperate situations, and they are \nasking for us to act much more quickly than has been occurring.\n  It is deeply disconcerting to me as I watched other countries, such \nas Italy, Spain, Great Britain, and France, on Saturday beginning to \nevacuate their citizens from Lebanon, taking them to Cyprus or taking \nthem to other places to safety, and yet I understand that even though \nwe have had some helicopters that have gone in--and I am grateful to \nthe Department of State for that because we have families from Michigan \nwho have been evacuated because of medical emergencies--the vast \nmajority of people are waiting for ships.\n  One ship was supposed to come today. I understand that was delayed, \nand now they are waiting until tomorrow. And there will be, I \nunderstand, two ships--one that will allow 1,400 people to leave, and \none that will allow 1,800 people to leave. But we are talking about in \nMichigan alone over 5,000 people, mostly women and children who have \ngone to see grandparents, have gone home for weddings, funerals, \nbirthday parties, gone to see grandpa and grandma or elderly, people \ngoing home who are frightened and who are in harm's way.\n  I am deeply concerned that we have not moved more quickly. I have \nimages of people sitting on rooftops in New Orleans waiting to be \nevacuated, waiting to be rescued, and now we have a similar situation \ngoing on with people waiting now 5 days, 6 days to leave a country that \nis in a war zone.\n  On top of that, we are now hearing that people who find themselves in \na war zone, not of their making, who thought they were going to visit \nfamily during their vacation time while the children were off school or \nfor some special event, are going to have to pay. Our Federal \nGovernment is requiring them to sign a promissory note to pay to leave \nto take their families to safety. That makes absolutely no sense.\n  So I plan to introduce a bill that will give the Secretary of State \nthe authority to waive the reimbursement requirement for U.S. citizens \nwho wish to evacuate Lebanon. The bill would waive the requirement in \ntwo cases: if it would create an undue financial hardship for a family \nor for an individual who is evacuated or if those citizens would be \nunable to recoup the cost of or reuse or get credit for a previously \npurchased airline ticket. That is the least we can do given the current \nsituation that is underway.\n  This would give those who cannot afford thousands in unexpected \ntravel costs an option for help. We cannot abandon American citizens \nwho are currently in a war zone.\n  I have been in touch with hundreds of people from Michigan. I am \nproud to have thousands of members of Michigan who are an important \npart of our community, who have family members and friends trapped in \nthe conflict in the Middle East. Frankly, our Government should be \nfocused on the fastest, the safest way to bring people home, not how \nmuch we are going to bill them once they get here.\n  Let me share a couple of the hundreds of calls we have taken.\n  Iman Hatoum called her two young children, girls 14 and 7, who were \nin Lebanon visiting their grandmother when the conflict broke out. She \nwas terrified, of course, for their safety, as anyone would be, and was \nworking to get them out, but she was worried because this promissory \nnote our Government is requiring them to sign would not be able to be \nsigned by a minor. So we were able to help her work through that \nsituation and to move forward. But she was terrified of what was going \nto happen to her children.\n  Samar Saad: Her family members--her cousins--were in Lebanon \nattending a wedding. They were all registered as requested by the \nDepartment of State on the Web site. But now one of her cousins was \ncritically injured in the bombings and is in the hospital. We now find \nthe family having to worry about medical bills because they were caught \nin a bombing and someone is now in a hospital, and they are having to \npay for, of course, the physical injuries suffered by their family. We \nshould not be charging them to come home, to come back to America where \nthey will be safe.\n  Hoda Amine sent this very desperate e-mail to my office:\n\n       Here we are stuck in Beirut, Lebanon, with over 25 family \n     members. We need you and others to contact our gov. locally \n     and nationally to get us out of here. We are all U.S. \n     citizens and tax payers. Let our money be put to good work by \n     saving ``real U.S. citizens who are in desperate need to be \n     saved. We have infants (my granddaughter) and elders (in-\n     laws and friends) who need help desperately.\n\n  It goes on to indicate that they have registered with the embassy \nthree times and have been informed to stay put, paying $150 each night \nat a hotel, and they say they are in a real, real emergency. Help us.\n  We need to do that. We need to be doing two things. We need to be \ngetting ships there as quickly as possible. They should already have \nbeen there. If ships from other countries could be there Saturday or \nSunday or Monday--now we are talking about not having something happen \nuntil Wednesday--there is no excuse for this.\n\n[[Page S7744]]\n\n  The U.S. State Department estimates there are approximately 25,000 \nAmerican citizens currently in Lebanon; 15,000 have registered with the \nState Department's Lebanon task force to receive evacuation \ninformation. We are keeping in constant contact with the task force.\n  Unfortunately, while we are working through all of this, current law \nrequires that U.S. citizens and others who qualify to be evacuated by \nthe Federal Government sign a promissory note pledging to reimburse the \nGovernment for their travel. They are later going to be billed by the \nState Department for the cost of any air, land, or sea transportation.\n  I am sure we all can imagine the situation or have family and \nfriends--I have many friends, I have many people with whom I have \ntalked, a friend over the weekend whose wife and young child went to \nvisit family and have tried various roads and avenues to leave and have \nnot been able to do that. People are frightened, people who are \nAmerican citizens, who are asking us to help quickly and to please not \nput them in a situation of more financial hardship because they thought \nthey were visiting their family in the summertime or they thought they \nwere going to a beautiful wedding celebration or they were sharing the \nsorrow of a funeral or visiting grandpa or grandma or schoolchildren \ngoing on buses.\n  A colleague from the other side of the aisle has 300 members of a \nchurch community who are in Lebanon right now and have not been able to \nleave. Surely we can come together on a bipartisan basis. I know there \nis bipartisan interest in this issue. I am hopeful that we can come \ntogether and agree that we ought not to be charging for these people to \nleave in order to be able to survive with their families. They did not \nknow this was going to happen. They had no idea they were going to be \nfacing this situation. But now they find themselves needing help from \ntheir Government to bring them home and to keep them safe. We have a \nresponsibility to make sure innocent people are not losing their lives \nor concerned about the safety of their children or their family members \nbecause of this situation. That is our responsibility, I believe, very \nstrongly.\n\n  This situation is frightening enough without people being placed in \nfinancial hardship to pay for a ship to Cyprus and then find themselves \nwhere their airline ticket doesn't work from Cyprus so they have to buy \na whole new ticket, or whatever it takes--thousands of dollars. People \nare being told that it is anywhere from $3,000 to $5,000 to be able to \nprotect their families and leave. That is just not right.\n  I really am hopeful--I know colleagues are concerned about this--I am \nhopeful that this legislation will be strongly embraced and that we can \nquickly give the Secretary of State the authority. We have been told by \nlegislative counsel they do not now have the authority to waive these \ncosts. So I am hopeful we will give them that authority very quickly \nand the Secretary of State will then be able, in a humanitarian way, to \naddress a very critical and frightening situation for many Americans \nright now in Lebanon.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/18/senate-section/article/S7744-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 A TRIBUTE TO ANNA MAY HAWEKOTTE SMITH\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nremarkable and compassionate woman. Anna May Hawekotte Smith fought \ntirelessly for underdogs of every sort throughout a professional career \nhat lasted more than 50 years. She passed away on July 5 at the rich \nage of 90.\n  In 1950, at the age of 35, while pregnant with her fourth child, Anna \nMay suffered a crippling stroke. She was left paralyzed, forced to \nrelearn such basic functions as walking and talking. Through \nperseverance, Anna May recovered. While a limp and leg brace remained \nthe only physical suggestions of her former impairment, the experience \nleft a lasting impression on Anna May. For the next 55 years, she used \nher extraordinary empathy, skills, and determination to help others and \nto advance many worthy causes.\n  Over the course of her lifetime, Anna May Hawekotte Smith served many \nroles--educator, administrator, advocate of social justice, champion of \nwomen's rights, wife, and mother. She attended Barat College in Lake \nForest, IL. After graduating in 1938, Anna May obtained a master's \ndegree in speech education from Columbia University in New York. She \ncontinued her graduate work in speech at Northwestern University in \nEvanston, IL, and interned with doctors at the University of Illinois \nNeuropsychiatric Clinic. Anna May Hawekotte Smith began her \nprofessional career as a professor at Barat College. She was soon \npromoted to chairman of the college's speech and drama department. \nDuring her tenure at Barat, she broadcast the first live women's radio \ntalk show to spotlight issues related social justice and the \nadvancement of women.\n  In 1966, she helped develop a program at Barat to help high school \ngirls from low-income families in Chicago and Lake County to prepare \nfor college. The Upward Bound Program, as it was called, ran for 8 \nyears and assisted hundreds of young women.\n  It was also during her time at Barat that Anna May met her future \nhusband, Charles Caroll Smith. Charles was executive director of the \nCatholic Youth Organization of Chicago and the administrative assistant \nto the late Archbishop Bernard J. Sheil. The pair wed in 1941 and \nraised three children together.\n  Anna May Hawekotte Smith was a woman of active faith. That was \nevident in her work on behalf of the Catholic Church, as well as in her \ncalm acceptance of the hand of God in her own life. Anna May Hawekotte \nSmith did not fear change; she embraced it as an adventure and God's \nwill for her. Her daughter, Sheila Smith, said her mother was never \nafraid of seeing one door close because she trusted God would open a \nnew door. Sheila remembers a couple of years ago, when Anna May learned \nthat Barat College would be closing its doors. She didn't express anger \nor frustration. Instead, she told her daughter that it was time to \nfocus on a new venture: the Barat Education Foundation. The foundation, \ncreated in 2000, would carry on the legacy of the school where she had \nspent so many years.\n  In 1969, Anna May's husband Charles passed away. Sheila remembers an \nevening shortly after her father died. She was sitting in the kitchen \nwith her mother when Frank Sinatra's classic song, ``My Way'' came on \nthe radio. Anna May told her daughter that, though she had been \ncomfortable in her life, she had often done what was expected of her \nand what other people wanted. Widowed now, at the age of 54, she was \nfree to make her own decisions, to live her life her way.\n  Anna May accepted a teaching position at Sangamon State University, \nnow the University of Illinois Springfield, in 1973 and remained a \nmember of the university faculty until her retirement in 1985. Today, a \nscholarship in her name recognizes Anna May's commitment to the \nadvancement of women.\n  Following her retirement, Anna May moved back to Chicago, where she \nbecame assistant director for job development programs at the Northern \nIllinois National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Throughout her life, she \nalso supported social justice causes ranging from civil rights to \nwomen's rights.\n  Mr. President, this Friday, July 21, on what would have been Anna \nMay's 91st birthday, her friends and family will gather at a memorial \nservice at Barat College Chapel to remember and honor this remarkable \nwoman. In the words of her family, Anna May Hawekotte Smith was more \nthan a lifelong learner, she was a lifelong doer. All of us who knew \nher recall her not only with fondness but with great admiration.\n  Our thoughts and prayers are with all of those whom she loved and who \nloved her, especially her children, Charles Smith, Sheila Smith, and \nCatherine Smith Wilson; her two brothers; and her six grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/18/senate-section/article/S7744-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7744-S7745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to\n\n[[Page S7745]]\n\nthe floor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our \ncountry.\n  On July 15, 2006, in Chicago, IL, a gay man was attacked by Marquell \nShepard after leaving a local bar. Shepard approached the man, berating \nhim with sexually derogatory slurs. Shepard then physically assaulted \nhim and fled the scene. He was soon picked up by police and charged \nwith a felony hate crime.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate.

Mr. President, yesterday, July 17, 2006, \nmarked the successful conclusion of the STS-121 space shuttle Discovery \nmission with its safe landing at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. \nThis 13-day mission was the 115th shuttle mission and the 18th to visit \nthe International Space Station. STS-121 satisfied its ``return to \nflight'' objectives by flight testing improvements to the shuttle and \ntesting on-orbit shuttle repair procedures. This flight provided more \nthan 28,000 pounds of equipment and supplies to the space station and \nenabled its number of occupants to grow to three. STS-121 included \nthree important spacewalks and laid the groundwork for the continued \nassembly, and ultimately doubling in size, of the space station.\n  I applaud the bravery, expertise, and accomplishments of the STS-121 \ncrew--Commander Steven Lindsey, Pilot Mark Kelly, and Mission \nSpecialists Michael Fossum, Lisa Nowak, Thomas Reiter, Piers Sellers, \nand Stephanie Wilson. This successful mission is a testament to the \nthousands of people who work on the space shuttle and space station \nprograms.\n  Mr. President, we must continue with our plans to fly the space \nshuttle in order to complete the construction of the International \nSpace Station. Equally important, we must work together to preserve the \nworkforce that will soon become the backbone of the new crew \nexploration vehicle and the next human space project.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/18/senate-section/article/S7745-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7745-S7749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   VOTING RIGHTS ACT REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, more than 2 months ago I joined the \nChairmen of both the Senate and House Judiciary Committees, the ranking \nmember of the House Judiciary Committee, the Democratic and Republican \nleaders of both the Senate and the House of Representatives, and \nMembers of Congress from both parties to introduce a bill to \nreauthorize and reinvigorate the temporary provisions of the Voting \nRights Act of 1965. The bicameral, bipartisan introduction of this bill \nreflects not only its historic importance as a guarantor of the right \nto vote for all Americans, but also the broad consensus that the \nexpiring provisions must be extended this year without delay. \nUnfortunately, we in the Senate have been delayed in getting this bill \nto the Senate floor by repeated cancellations and postponements of \ncommittee hearings and markups. The bill was also delayed in the House \nof Representatives for a month by a small group of opponents. \nFortunately, the House was able to pass this legislation last week with \n390 Members voting in favor. Now it is time for the Senate to do its \npart and pass this bill.\n  At my request, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee has \nagreed to hold a special executive business session of the committee so \nthat after a month of delay we can report out the Fannie Lou Hamer, \nRosa Parks and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and \nAmendments Act of 2006. I hope that this vital civil rights legislation \nwill be ready for full Senate consideration without further delay and \nthat we can proceed with deliberate speed to pass the House-passed bill \nso that it may become law before Congress takes its summer vacation.\n  The U.S. Constitution specifically provides that Congress has the \npower to remedy discrimination under both the fourteenth and the \nfifteenth amendments. Over the course of nine Judiciary Committee \nhearings we received testimony from a range of constitutional scholars, \nvoting rights advocates, and Supreme Court practitioners. There was \nagreement among these witnesses that Congress is at the height of its \npowers when giving enforceable meaning to these amendments by enacting \nlaws that address racial discrimination in connection with voting. The \nfourteenth and fifteenth amendments have not changed. As long as these \namendments are in our Constitution, Congress has the authority to \nenforce them, especially on matters of racial discrimination in \nconnection with the right to vote. These are matters of fundamental \nimportance.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee held several hearings this year on the \ncontinuing need for the provision of the Voting Rights Act that \nrequires covered jurisdictions to ``pre-clear'' all voting changes \nbefore they go into effect. This provision has been a tremendous source \nof protection for the voting rights of those long discriminated against \nand also a great deterrent against discriminatory efforts cropping up \nanew. Some academic witnesses suggested in their committee testimony \nthat section 5 should be a victim of its success. In my view, \nabandoning a successful deterrent just because it works defies logic \nand common sense. Why risk losing the gains we have made? When this \nCongress finds an effective and constitutional way to prevent \nviolations of the fundamental right to vote, we should preserve it. Now \nis no time for backsliding.\n  Since section 5 of the Voting Rights Act was first enacted in 1965 \nand last reauthorized in 1982, the country has made tremendous progress \nin combating racial discrimination. Certain jurisdictions disregarded \nthe fifteenth amendment for almost 100 years and had a history of \npervasive discriminatory practices that resisted attempts at redress \nfrom the passage of the fifteenth amendment in 1870 to the passage of \nthe Voting Rights Act in 1965. Section 5 is intended to be a remedy for \nviolations of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments, in place for as \nlong as necessary to enforce those amendments and eliminate practices \ndenying or abridging the rights of minorities to participate in the \npolitical process. In fact, due in large measure to the remedies \nprovided in the VRA, many voters in jurisdictions covered for the \npurposes of section 5 have gained the effective exercise of their right \nto vote.\n  However, based on the record established in hearings before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee and the Subcommittee on Constitution, Civil \nRights, and Property Rights, which builds on the extensive record \nestablished in the House of Representatives, there remains a compelling \nneed for section 5. The Judiciary Committee received three categories \nof evidence supporting the continuation of this remedy. First, there is \nevidence that even with section 5 in place, covered jurisdictions have \ncontinued to engage in discriminatory tactics. Often, this recurring \ndiscrimination takes on more subtle forms than in 1965 or 1982, such as \nvote dilution, which relies on racially polarized voting to deny the \neffectiveness of the votes cast by members of a particular race. \nSecond, there is evidence of the effectiveness of section 5 as a \ndeterrent against bad practices in covered jurisdictions. Finally, \nthere is evidence of the prophylactic effect of section 5, preserving \nthe gains that have been achieved against the risk of backsliding.\n  Today, I would like to provide some of the evidence received in the \nJudiciary Committee about the persistence of discriminatory practices \nin covered jurisdictions that supports reauthorization of this crucial \nprovision.\n  The robust record compiled in the Senate Judiciary Committee includes \nvoluminous evidence of recurring discrimination in section 5 covered \njurisdictions. Often, this recurring discrimination takes on more \nsubtle forms than in 1965 or 1982, such as vote dilution and \nredistricting to deny the effectiveness of the votes cast by members of \na particular race. Notably, many jurisdictions are repeat offenders, \ncontinuing a pattern of persistent resistance dating back to the \nenactment of the VRA. Debo P. Adegbile, Associate\n\n[[Page S7746]]\n\nDirector of Litigation of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, \nInc., testified about some examples of the types of evidence in the \nrecord:\n  The Record before this Congress presents continued evidence of such \nviolations, and highlights the necessity for continued review of \nvoting changes to protect minority voters in covered jurisdictions. For \nexample, since the VRA's 1982 renewal, violations of minority voting \nrights have taken the form of last minute election date or polling \nplace changes, discrimination at the polls, and familiar dilutive \ntactics of ``cracking'' and ``packing'' minority voting districts.\n\n  Objections to voting changes interposed by DOJ are one category of \nevidence relevant to the persistence of discrimination in covered \njurisdictions. Although several witnesses pointed to a recent reduction \nin VRA objections as a reason to oppose extension of section 5, in fact \nthere have been more objections in covered jurisdictions since the last \nreauthorization in 1982--608--than there were before that \nreauthorization, including 80 statewide section 5 objections. However, \nthese objections only reveal a chapter of a much longer story. Mr. \nAdegbile also testified:\n  Although many VRA opponents and commentators point to a recent \nreduction in DOJ objections as evidence of the decreasing need for \nSection 5--this analysis oversimplifies the many ways in which the law \nserves to protect minority voters. Excluded from the category of \nobjection statistics are other categories of deterred and rejected \nvoting changes. These include matters that were denied preclearance by \nthe Washington D.C. District Court; matters that were settled while \npending before that court; voting changes that were withdrawn, altered \nor abandoned after the DOJ made formal More Information Requests, MIRs; \nas well as any recognition that the very existence of preclearance \ndeters discriminatory voting changes in the first place. Taken \ntogether, these categories provide a more holistic view of the sizeable \nimpact, deterrent effect, and continued need for section 5's \nprovisions. Moreover, without the section 5 preclearance provisions \nmany jurisdictions that have experienced a long history of exclusionary \npractices in voting would have lacked the incentive to tailor their \nelectoral changes in a non-discriminatory fashion. Even with section 5 \nin place, many covered jurisdictions made voting changes that \ndisadvantaged minority voters without preclearing them with the DOJ.\n  This is the Testimony of Debo P. Adegbile, Associate Director of \nLitigation of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., \nbefore the United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the \nConstitution, June 21, 2006, citing generally Luis Ricardo Fraga & \nMaria Lizet Ocampo, More Information Requests and the Deterrent Effect \nof section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, June 7, 2006--unpublished essay, \nsubmitted to Senate Judiciary Committee on June 9, 2006.\n  The following are only a small set of examples from the robust record \ncompiled in the Senate Judiciary Committee:\n\n                            Vote Suppression\n\n       Through the use of illegal devices, State and local \n     officials in covered jurisdictions have suppressed the \n     ability of minority voters to effectively exercise their \n     right to vote.\n       In 2001, Kilmichael, Mississippi's white mayor and all \n     white five-member Board of Alderman abruptly cancelled an \n     election after census data revealed that African Americans \n     had become the majority in the town and an unprecedented \n     number of African-American candidates were running for \n     office. Even after DOJ objected, concluding that the \n     cancellation was an attempt to suppress the African-American \n     candidates, the mayor and board did not reschedule the \n     election. Only after DOJ forced Kilmichael to hold an \n     election in 2003 did it elect its first African-American \n     mayor, along with three African-American alderman. This is \n     from Caroline Fredrickson and Deborah J. Vagins, Promises to \n     Keep: The Impact of the Voting Rights Act, March 2006, at 12.\n       In March, 2004, in Prairie View, Texas, home to \n     historically black Prairie View A University, two students \n     decided to run for the local governing body. The white \n     criminal district attorney threatened that any student who \n     voted in the election would face felony prosecution for \n     ``illegal voting'' and only withdrew his statements when the \n     NAACP filed suit. Shortly thereafter, the Commissioner's \n     Court voted to reduce the availability of early voting at the \n     polling place closest to the college from 17 hours over two \n     days, to 6 hours on one day. This would have severely limited \n     the students' political participation, as most planned to \n     take advantage of early voting since their spring break \n     coincided with the primary date. The county did not restore \n     the voting hours until the NAACP filed a section 5 \n     enforcement suit. This is from Laughlin McDonald ``The Case \n     for Extending and Amending the Voting Rights Act,'' A Report \n     of the Voting Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties \n     Union at 65-66.\n       In a 2004 opinion invalidating South Dakota's redistricting \n     plan, a Federal district judge documented the State's long \n     history of discrimination, including persistent efforts to \n     suppress the Native American vote since 1999. The judge \n     documented illegal denials of the right to vote in certain \n     elections, barriers to voter registration, intimidation and \n     unsubstantiated charges of vote fraud, lack of access to \n     polling sites, non-compliance with the Voting Rights Act's \n     language assistance provision, and dilutive voting schemes. \n     The opinion also quoted legislators expressing prejudice \n     against Indians. For example, when debating an unsuccessful \n     bill to make it easier for Indians to register, one \n     legislator said, ``I'm not sure we want that kind of person \n     in the polling place.' '' This is from National Commission on \n     the Voting Rights Act, ``Protecting Minority Voters: The \n     Voting Rights Act at Work 1982-2005'' February 2006 at 44.\n       The Mayor of the Town of North Johns, AL intentionally \n     discriminated against African-American candidates for city \n     council when he frustrated the attempts of these candidates \n     to acquire the required forms for their candidacy and refused \n     to swear them in when they won their elections. The court \n     found that the mayor acted to undermine the candidacy of two \n     African-American men because their election would result in \n     the town council becoming majority black. This is from \n     Dillard v. North Johns, 717 F. Supp. 1471, M.D. Ala. 1989.\n\n                      Discriminatory Redistricting\n\n       Due to racially polarized voting, the reality in many \n     jurisdictions is that the ability of minorities to have the \n     opportunity to elect their candidate of choice is often \n     dependent on the racial composition of a voting district. \n     Consequently, the seemingly neutral task of drawing district \n     lines can, in fact, be used strategically to abridge \n     minorities' right to vote using techniques called ``packing'' \n     where a very large percentage of minorities are placed in a \n     single district and thereby denying them influence except in \n     that one jurisdiction, or the obverse ``unpacking,'' which \n     fragments minority communities into numerous jurisdictions, \n     denying them influence anywhere.\n       The impact of racially polarized voting is significant. In \n     the 2000 elections, only 8 percent of African Americans were \n     elected from majority white districts. This is from National \n     Commission on the Voting Rights Act, ``Protecting Minority \n     Voters: The Voting Rights Act at Work 1982-2005'' February \n     2006 at 38. As of 2000, neither Hispanics nor Native \n     Americans candidates had been elected to office from a \n     majority white district. Id. This is true throughout covered \n     jurisdictions. Every African-American representative \n     currently holding office in Congress from Louisiana, or in \n     the Louisiana State Legislature, has been elected from a \n     majority African-American district. This is from Debo P. \n     Adegbile, ``Voting Rights in Louisiana: 1982-2006,'' \n     RenewTheVRA.org at 9. In Mississippi, the State with the \n     highest percentage African-American population, not a single \n     African-American candidate has won election to Congress or \n     the state legislature from a majority-white district, and no \n     African-American candidate has won a statewide office in the \n     20th Century. This is from Robert McDuff, ``Voting Rights in \n     Mississippi: 1982-2006,'' RenewTheVRA.org at 13.\n       After failing to redistrict for over two decades, following \n     the 1980 and 1990 census, the city of Seguin, Texas was 60 \n     percent Hispanic, yet only 3 out of 9 city council members \n     were Hispanic. After a successful section 5 challenge by \n     Hispanic plaintiffs, the city redrew its discriminatory \n     districts in 1994 and again following the 2000 census, but \n     cut short the filing deadlines for the upcoming elections, \n     ensuring that the white incumbent would run unopposed. \n     Another section 5 suit was necessary to prevent this change, \n     called by some merely de minimis even though it determined \n     the election's outcome, from going into effect. This is \n     Testimony of John Trasvina, Interim President and General \n     Counsel, Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund \n     MALDEF, before the United States Senate Judiciary Committee, \n     June 13, 2006, at 4.\n       At a 2001 section 2 hearing, while testifying in defense of \n     the St. Bernard Parish School Board's illegal plan to \n     eliminate its only African-American district, Louisiana State \n     Senator Lynn Dean, the highest ranking public official in St. \n     Bernard Parish, admitted that he uses a term considered by \n     many to be a derogatory, even offensive, word in referring to \n     African Americans, had done so recently, and does not \n     necessarily consider it a racial term. Dean had served on the \n     school board for 10 years. This is from Debo P. Adegbile, \n     ``Voting Rights in Louisiana: 1982-2005,'' RenewTheVRA.org at \n     26.\n       In the post-1990 redistricting cycle, the Department of \n     Justice objected to Georgia's Senate redistricting bill twice \n     and to Georgia's House redistricting bill three times. The \n     newly adopted plans were then challenged by litigation in \n     which the state admitted to constitutional violations. After\n\n[[Page S7747]]\n\n     losing the lawsuit, the state claimed to remedy the problem. \n     However, its newly adopted plans reduced the black \n     populations of numerous districts, thereby drawing DOJ \n     objections to both plans yet again in March 1996. This is \n     from Robert Kengle, ``Voting Rights in Louisiana: 1982-\n     2006,'' RenewTheVRA.org at 14.\n       The 2001 legislative redistricting plan in South Dakota, \n     which divided the State into thirty-five legislative \n     districts, altered the boundaries of District 27, which \n     included Shannon and Todd Counties, so that American Indians \n     comprised 90 percent of the district, while the district was \n     one of the most overpopulated in the State. Had American \n     Indians not been ``packed'' in District 27, they could have \n     comprised a majority in a house district in adjacent District \n     26. South Dakota refused to submit the plan for pre-\n     clearance, leading Alfred Bone Shirt and three other \n     residents from Districts 26 and 27 to sue the State in \n     December 2001. The plaintiffs claimed that South Dakota \n     failed to submit its plan for pre-clearance and also that the \n     plan unnecessarily packed Indian voters in violation of \n     section 2. A 3-judge court ordered the state to seek pre-\n     clearance and the Attorney General pre-cleared it, concluding \n     that the additional packing of Indians in District 27 did not \n     have a retrogressive effect. However, the district court, \n     sitting as a single-judge court, heard the plaintiffs' \n     section 2 claim and invalidated the State's 2001 legislative \n     plan as diluting American Indian voting strength, finding \n     that there was ``substantial evidence that South Dakota \n     officially excluded Indians from voting and holding office.'' \n     This is from Bone Shirt v. Hazeltine, 200 F. Supp. 2d 1150, \n     1154 D.S.D. 2002.\n       In 2001, the Louisiana State Legislature sought judicial \n     pre-clearance of its statewide redistricting plan for the \n     Louisiana House of Representatives, which eliminated a \n     majority African-American district in Orleans Parish. \n     According to the legislators that drew that plan, the \n     district was eliminated because white voters in Orleans \n     Parish were entitled to ``proportional representation,'' \n     despite significant population growth among African-Americans \n     in Orleans Parish over the course of the prior decade. \n     Although the legislators ultimately dropped their selective \n     ``proportional representation'' argument, the court found \n     that the state ``blatantly violate[ed] important procedural \n     rules'' through its litigation tactics and condemned the \n     state for its ``radical mid-course revision in [its legal] \n     theory of the case.'' The evidence, obtained over plaintiffs' \n     resistance via a motion to compel, showed significant levels \n     of racially-polarized voting in virtually all electoral \n     contests, as well as retrogressive purpose and effect in the \n     adoption of the plan. The evidence also showed that the \n     Speaker Pro Tempore, who was a plaintiff in the action, \n     removed long-standing language from the State's redistricting \n     guidelines that acknowledged the State's obligations under \n     the VRA at the start of the line drawing cycle. The \n     litigation resulted in a settlement on the eve of trial that \n     restored the opportunity district in Orleans Parish. The 2001 \n     Louisiana House redistricting plan followed the standard \n     practice in Louisiana as no initial redistricting plan for \n     the Louisiana House of Representatives has ever been pre-\n     cleared by DOJ since the inception of Voting Rights Act in \n     1965. This is Testimony of Richard Engstrom before the House \n     of Representatives, Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee \n     on the Constitution, October 25, 2005. This is also Debo \n     P. Adegbile, Voting Rights in Louisiana, 1982-2006, at 16.\n       After finding Point Coupee Parish, Louisiana's \n     redistricting plans retrogressive, the Department of Justice \n     objected 3 decades in a row: in 1983, 1992, and 2002. After \n     the first 2 census cycles, the parish attempted to pack \n     minority voters into a single district while fragmenting the \n     remaining African-Americans into majority-white districts. In \n     2002, without explanation, the parish eliminated one majority \n     African-American district, despite an increase in the \n     African-American population of the parish. Unfortunately, the \n     experience in Point Coupee Parish is typical in Louisiana: \n     ``[b]etween 1982 and 2003, 10 other parishes were ``repeat \n     offenders,'' and 13 times the DOJ noted that local \n     authorities were merely resubmitting objected-to proposals \n     with cosmetic or no changes.'' This is Debo P. Adegbile, \n     ``Voting Rights in Louisiana: 1982-2006,'' RenewTheVRA.org at \n     27.\n       In 1983, African-American legislators were excluded from \n     legislative sessions held to develop Louisiana's post-census \n     redistricting plan after negotiations stalled. The governor \n     had threatened to veto a proposed plan that would create one \n     African-American majority district and the Senate rejected \n     the governor's plan to create all white majority districts. \n     In the absence of minority legislators, a compromise--Act \n     20--was reached that sacrificed the majority-minority \n     district despite the fact that--after a marked increase in \n     the previous decade--the highly-concentrated African-American \n     population now made up 48.9 percent of the voting age \n     population in Orleans Parish. Act 20 was struck down by a \n     1982 section 2 case. The remedied district led to the \n     election of Louisiana's first African-American congressman \n     since reconstruction. This is also from Debo P. Adegbile, \n     ``Voting Rights in Louisiana: 1982-2006,'' RenewTheVRA.org at \n     16.\n       In 1991 and 1992, the Morehouse Parish, Louisiana, Police \n     Jury drew district lines in an attempt to pack African-\n     American voters in the city of Bastrop multiple times in \n     defiance of DOJ objections. After a 1991 section 5 objection \n     to its attempt to draw the same districting plan several \n     times the Morehouse Parish Police Jury made cosmetic changes \n     and resubmitted the same plan. After DOJ lodged another \n     objection, the police jury resubmitted the same plan with \n     only cosmetic changes. Only after DOJ objected a third time \n     in 1992 did the police jury address the substance of the \n     first objection and draw district lines that did not result \n     in an over-concentration of African-American voters.\n       In 2006, election officials in Randolph County, Georgia, \n     moved the board of education district lines to include Henry \n     Cook, the African-American chair of the board of education, \n     from District Five of the county board of education, which is \n     majority black, to District Four, which is majority white. In \n     District Four, Cook would almost certainly be defeated given \n     the prevalence of racial bloc voting in the county, depriving \n     the African-American community of an incumbent elected \n     official who had their strong support in past elections. \n     Although Randolph County was covered by section 5, county \n     officials refused to submit the change for pre-clearance. \n     African-American residents of the county filed suit on April \n     17, 2006, to enjoin use of the change absent pre-clearance. \n     On June 5, 2006, the 3-judge court issued an order enjoining \n     further use of the voting change because of failure to comply \n     with section 5.\n       In 1991, Mississippi legislators rejected proposed House \n     and Senate redistricting plans that would have given African-\n     American voters greater opportunity to elect representatives \n     of their choice, referring to one such alternative on the \n     House floor as the ``black plan'' and privately as ``the n-\n     plan.'' DOJ objected, concluding that a racially \n     discriminatory purpose was at play. In the 1992 elections, \n     the cured redistricting plans boosted the percentage of \n     African-American representatives in the legislature to an all \n     time high: 27 percent of the House and 19 percent of the \n     Senate--up from 13 percent and 4 percent respectively in a \n     state where 33 percent of the voting age population is \n     African-American. This is Robert McDuff, ``Voting Rights in \n     Mississippi: 1982-2006,'' RenewTheVRA.org at 9-10.\n       In late 2001, Northampton County, VA proposed a change in \n     the method of electing the board of supervisors by collapsing \n     six districts into three larger districts. The DOJ objected, \n     finding that three of the six districts were majority-\n     minority districts in which African-American voters regularly \n     elected their candidates of choice. The new plan would have \n     diluted the minority-majorities and caused them to completely \n     disappear in 2 of the 3 new districts--clearly having \n     retrogressive effects. Two years later, the county provided a \n     new 6-district plan, which had the same retrogressive effects \n     of the 3-district plan. DOJ objected and provided a model \n     non-retrogressive, 6-district plan, which has yet to be \n     followed by the county. This from Anita S. Earls, Kara \n     Millonzi, Oni Seliski, and Torrey Dixon, ``Voting Rights in \n     Virginia, 1982-2006,'' RenewTheVRA.org at 27-28.\n       In 1989, in section 2 suit, a Federal district court \n     knocked down Chickasaw County, Mississippi, illegal plan to \n     have all majority-white supervisors' districts. Sent back to \n     the drawing board, the county then passed 3 different plans \n     over the next 6 years. Not one passed section 5 pre-\n     clearance. Finally, the Federal court drew its own plan for \n     the 1995 elections, providing for 2 majority-black districts \n     to reflect a population that was nearly 40 percent black. \n     Only then did the county adopt a plan that met no objection \n     by the Department of Justice. This is Robert McDuff, ``Voting \n     Rights in Mississippi: 1982-2006,'' RenewTheVRA.org at 6.\n       In 1992, DOJ objected to a Justice of the Peace and \n     Constable redistricting plan in Galveston County, Texas, that \n     fractured geographically compact African-American and \n     Hispanic voters and provided no opportunity districts among \n     the 8 districts in the plan, even though African Americans \n     and Hispanic comprised 31 percent of the county's population. \n     This is from Nina Perales, Luis Figueroa and Criselda G. \n     Rivas, ``Voting Rights in Texas, 1982-2006'', \n     RenewTheVRA.org, at 17-18.\n       In 1992, DOJ objected to the Terrell County Commissioners \n     Court redistricting plan. Although the Hispanic population in \n     the county had increased from 43 percent to 53 percent, the \n     proposed redistricting plan cracked the Hispanic population \n     by substantially decreasing the number of Hispanic voters in \n     one of the two Hispanic majority districts and packing \n     them into the other to create a district with an 83 \n     percent Hispanic district. This is from Nina Perales, Luis \n     Figueroa and Criselda G. Rivas, ``Voting Rights in Texas, \n     1982-2006,'' RenewTheVRA.org, at 19.\n       In 2005, DOJ objected to the redistricting plan for the \n     Town of Delhi, LA, which eliminated an African-American \n     opportunity district, rejected an alternative plan which \n     would have been better for minority voters, and was adopted \n     with the intent to worsen the position of minority voters. \n     According to the 2000 Census, Delhi's population was majority \n     African-American, yet local officials attempted to reduce \n     minority voting strength in the town. DOJ denied pre-\n     clearance after determining that town officials sought to \n     worsen the position of minority voters by looking first to \n     the historical background of the city's decision, which \n     revealed that the plan was adopted despite steadily \n     increasing growth in the town's African-American population. \n     In its April 25, 2005, objection letter, DOJ stated, \n     ``[w]ithout\n\n[[Page S7748]]\n\n     question, Black voters are worse off under the proposed \n     plan,'' which was adopted despite the counsel of the Town's \n     demographer, who noted the retrogressive effect of the plan. \n     This is from a Letter from R. Alexander Acosta, Assistant \n     Attorney General, Civil Rights Division, U.S. Department of \n     Justice, to Mr. David Creed, Executive Director, North Delta \n     Regional Planning and Development District, April 25, 2005.\n       In 1992, the Department of Justice objected to Florida's \n     redistricting plan for the State Senate, observing that \n     ``[w]ith regard to the Hillsborough County area, the State \n     has chosen to draw its senatorial districts such that there \n     are no districts in which minority persons constitute a \n     majority of the voting age population. To accomplish this \n     result, the State chose to divide the politically cohesive \n     minority populations in the Tampa and St. Petersburg areas.'' \n     This is from JoNel Newman, ``Voting Rights in Florida, 1982-\n     2006'', RenewTheVRA.org, at 9.\n       The Department of Justice interposed an objection to the \n     2002 redistricting plan for the Florida House of \n     Representatives, stating that the plan reduced ``the ability \n     of Collier County Hispanic voters to elect their candidate of \n     choice [and] the drop in Hispanic population in the proposed \n     district would make it impossible for these Hispanic voters \n     to continue to do so.'' As a result of the Department's \n     Section 5 objection to the 2002 reapportionment plan, \n     Hispanic majority-minority district was preserved in Collier \n     County. This is JoNel Newman, ``Voting Rights in Florida, \n     1982-2006,'' RenewTheVRA.org, at 10.\n       In 2002, the Department of Justice objected to Arizona's \n     state legislative redistricting plan because it fractured \n     Hispanic voters and reduced Hispanic voting age population in \n     5 districts below their 1994 benchmarks, despite the growth \n     of the State's Hispanic population and the ability to draw \n     three compact majority-Hispanic districts. The State court \n     responded by accepting an interim plan recommended by a \n     Special Master that restored one district to its benchmark \n     level and created 2 new Hispanic-majority districts in \n     metropolitan Phoenix to replace some of the other four \n     majority Hispanic-majority districts that had been \n     eliminated.\n       In 1991, Hispanic plaintiffs and Monterrey County, \n     California, which was 33.6 percent Hispanic, reached a \n     settlement plan which, unlike Monterrey's initial plan, did \n     not dilute the vote of the county's Hispanic population. \n     However, after voters struck down the county's redistricting \n     plan in a required referendum petition, the county issued a \n     new plan to which the Justice Department objected under \n     section 5, stating that the County's plan ``. . . appears \n     deliberately to sacrifice Federal redistricting requirements, \n     including a fair recognition of Hispanic voting strength, in \n     order to advance the political interests of the non-minority \n     residents of northern Monterey County.'' Subsequently, the \n     district court adopted the plaintiffs' plan. As a result of \n     the implementation of the plaintiffs' plan, a Hispanic was \n     elected to the Board of Supervisors for the first time in \n     over 100 years. This is Gonzalez v. Monterey County 808 \n     F.Supp. 727, 729 (N.D. Cal. 1992); Joaquin G. Avila, \n     California State Report on Voting Discrimination (forthcoming \n     May 25, 2006, manuscript at 9.\n       After the 1990 census, Merced County, CA, adopted a \n     redistricting plan that ignored the presence of its growing \n     Hispanic population which at the time constituted 32.6 \n     percent. In doing so, the county disregarded its \n     demographer's recommendation to create a supervisor district \n     with a Hispanic majority and instead chose a plan that \n     fragmented the county's Hispanic population. The Justice \n     Department issued an objection rejecting the county's \n     redistricting plan because the plan fragmented the Hispanic \n     population. Following the objection, the county created a new \n     redistricting plan that both avoided the fragmentation of the \n     county's Hispanic population and created a supervisory \n     district with a Hispanic majority. The plan was later \n     approved and a Hispanic Supervisor elected. This is Joaquin \n     G. Avila, California State Report on Voting Discrimination, \n     forthcoming May 25, 2006, manuscript at 11.\n\n                  Discriminatory Polling Place Changes\n\n       Another method used in covered jurisdictions to deny \n     minorities the right to vote has been to move or even \n     eliminate polling places, often without notice. Moving a \n     polling place can appear to have little impact or importance, \n     but the record demonstrates that these changes have been used \n     systematically to deny minorities their constitutional right \n     to vote by injecting intimidation and confusion into the \n     electoral process.\n       Some have cited polling place changes as ``de minimis'' \n     changes for which there should be an exception to section 5 \n     pre-clearance. However, making such an exeception could lead \n     to substantial violations of minority voting rights. As \n     Robert McDuff, a civil rights attorney in Mississippi who has \n     worked on preclearance testified, ``polling place changes can \n     be retrogressive and should not be dismissed as per se de \n     minimis. With section 5 preclearance requests the context is \n     critical and DOJ has an expertise in assessing the context.'' \n     Robert McDuff, Answers to Written Questions from Senator \n     Coburn. The following examples demonstrate that far from \n     being ``de minimis,'' polling place changes can be one of the \n     most effective means of denying minorities the right to vote.\n       In 1992, the Attorney General objected to a proposal by the \n     Wrightsville, GA, to relocate the polling place from the \n     county courthouse to the American Legion Hall, an all-white \n     club with a history of refusing membership to black \n     applicants and a then-current practice of hosting \n     functions to which blacks were not welcome. This is \n     Laughlin McDonald ``The Case for Extending and Amending \n     the Voting Rights Act,'' A Report of the Voting Rights \n     Project of the American Civil Liberties Union at 333, 334.\n       In 1995, Jenkins Parish, LA, attempted to relocate a \n     polling place from a predominately black community easily \n     accessible to many voters by foot to a location outside the \n     city limits in a predominately white neighborhood which had \n     no sidewalks, curving roads, and a speed limit of 55 mph. The \n     Attorney General rejected the change, concluding, ``the \n     county's proffered reasons for the selection of this \n     particular polling site appear to be pretextual, as the \n     selection of this location appears to be designed, in part, \n     to thwart recent black political participation.'' This is \n     Deval L. Patrick, Assistant Attorney General, to William E. \n     Woodrum, Jenkins County Attorney, March 20, 1995.\n       In 1985, the Apache County Board of Supervisors proposed to \n     eliminate the last remaining polling place on Arizona's Fort \n     Apache Reservation, reduce the daily hours of operation for \n     those voting stations that remained open, and implement a \n     rotating polling place system that would make it even harder \n     for Navajo voters to reach the polls. Yet, absentee voting \n     opportunities were not provided to Indian voters. Pointing to \n     the clear discriminatory purpose and effect of the proposed \n     changes, the Department of Justice objected. This is James \n     Thomas Tucker and Rodolfo Espino, ``Voting Rights in Arizona \n     1982-2006,'' RenewtheVRA.org, 46, 2006.\n       In 1994, after receiving word that whites were \n     uncomfortable walking into an African-American neighborhood \n     to vote at the Sunset Community Center, the St. Landry \n     Parish, LA, Police Jury moved the polling place to the Sunset \n     Town Hall, the site of historical racial discrimination. The \n     police jury did not hold a public hearing, seek any further \n     input, or advertise the change in any way. If not for the \n     section 5 pre-clearance process, minority voters would not \n     have known of the change until Election Day. This is Debo P. \n     Adegbile, ``Voting Rights in Louisiana, 1982-2006,'' \n     RenewtheVRA.org, at 31.\n       In 1999, after the Davills Precinct polling center burned \n     down and the County Board of Supervisors of Dinwiddie County, \n     Virginia, moved the polling place to the Cut Bank Hunt Club, \n     privately owned with a large African-American membership, one \n     hundred and five citizens submitted their signatures to have \n     the precinct moved to the Mansons United Methodist Church, \n     located three miles southeast of the Hunt Club. The \n     petition's stated purpose for moving the precinct was for a \n     ``more central location.'' Before the board's meeting to \n     discuss moving the polling place, the Mansons United \n     Methodist Church withdrew its name as a possible location. \n     The board then placed an advertisement for a public hearing \n     on changing the polling place which stated that if any \n     ``suitable centrally located location [could] be found prior \n     to July 15, 1999,'' they would consider moving it there. On \n     July 12, 1999, the Bott Memorial Presbyterian Church members \n     offered their facilities for polling. On August 4, 1999, the \n     board approved changing the polling place to Bott Memorial \n     Presbyterian Church. The church is located at the extreme \n     east end of the precinct, however, and 1990 Census data \n     showed that a significant portion of the black population \n     resides in the western end of the precinct.\n       DOJ objected to the change, finding that the polling place \n     was moved for discriminatory reasons. This is a Letter from \n     Bill Lann Lee, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Civil \n     Rights Division, U.S. DOJ., to Benjamin W. Emerson of Sands, \n     Anderson, Marks & Miller, October 27, 1999.\n\n                          Methods of Elections\n\n       Officials have used their authority to set the methods of \n     elections as ways to abridge or even deny the ability of \n     minority citizens to vote and elect candidates of their \n     choice. The following are examples of the use of at-large \n     election systems, dual registration systems and other methods \n     since the last reauthorization of section 5.\n       In 1995, the State of Mississippi resurrected a form of the \n     dual registration system, which a Federal district court had \n     struck down less than a decade earlier as racially \n     discriminatory in intent and effect. Mississippi then refused \n     to submit its voting procedures for pre-clearance until \n     ordered to do so by the U.S. Supreme Court. Under the \n     unlawful system, voters who registered pursuant to the \n     National Voter Registration Act, NVRA, would only be eligible \n     to vote in federal elections, but not in State and local \n     elections. The majority of voters registered under the NVRA \n     were African-American. In addition, while one state \n     department provided its mostly-African-American public \n     assistance clientele with only the NVRA registration forms, \n     another department registered its mostly-white driver's \n     license applicants through the state forms, which enabled \n     them to vote in all elections. In its objection letter, DOJ \n     noted the state had merely breathed new life into the dual \n     registration system originally enacted by Mississippi in the \n     19th Century with an aim to eliminate the African-American \n     vote. This is Robert McDuff, ``Voting Rights in Mississippi: \n     1982-2006,'' RenewTheVRA.org at 16.\n\n[[Page S7749]]\n\n       In 1992, Effingham County, Georgia proposed an at-large \n     election system despite anticipating that, due to racially \n     polarized voting, after the change, African-Americans would \n     no longer be able to elect the commissioner who would serve \n     as chairperson. This decision came on the heels of the \n     county's decision to eliminate the position of vice-\n     chairperson, long held by an African-American commissioner. \n     The county's justification for the change--that the proposed \n     system would avoid tie votes in the selection of a \n     chairperson--was tenuous at best because under the new \n     system, an even number of commissioners would invite tie \n     votes to a greater extent than the existing system. This is \n     Robert Kengle, ``Voting Rights in Georgia: 1982-2006,'' \n     RenewTheVRA.org at 9-10.\n       Ten years after a successful lawsuit that forced the \n     adoption of single-member districts in the city of Freeport, \n     TX, minority candidates had gained two seats on the city \n     council. The City then sought to revert to at-large \n     elections, garnering an objection from the Department of \n     Justice. Similarly, the Haskill Consolidated Independent \n     School District sought to revert to at-large voting after \n     significant gains by minority populations.\n       After the Washington Parish, Louisiana, School Board \n     finally added a second majority-African American district in \n     1993, bringing the total to 2 out of 8, representing an \n     African American population of 32 percent, it immediately \n     created a new at-large seat to ensure that no white incumbent \n     would lose his or her seat and to reduce the impact of the \n     two African American members, to 2 out of 9. The \n     Department of Justice objected to this change. (See Letter \n     from James P. Turner, Assistant Attorney General, Civil \n     Rights Division, U.S. DOJ, to Sherri Marcus Morris, \n     Assistant Attorney General, State of Louisiana, and Jerald \n     N. Jones, City of Shreveport, September 11, 1995, cited in \n     Debo Adegbile, Voting Rights in Louisiana: 1982-2006, \n     February 2006, at 21.)\n       A Federal district court found that the at-large method of \n     electing the nine member Charleston County Council in South \n     Carolina violated section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. In \n     particular, the court found evidence of white bloc voting and \n     concluded that in 10 general elections involving African-\n     American candidates, ``white and minority voters were \n     polarized 100 percent of the time.'' The court also noted \n     that there was a history of discrimination that hindered the \n     present ability of minority voters to participate in the \n     political process; significant socio-economic disparities \n     along racial lines; a negligible history of African-American \n     electoral success; and significant evidence of intimidation \n     and harassment of African-American voters at the polls. \n     Following the court's decision, which was affirmed on appeal, \n     a single-member district plan was put in place with four \n     majority African-American districts that eventually led to \n     the election of four African Americans to the County Council. \n     This is Laughlin McDonald ``The Case for Extending and \n     Amending the Voting Rights Act,'' A Report of the Voting \n     Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union at 591-\n     592.\n       In 2005, a three-judge Federal court enjoined the city of \n     McComb, MS, from enforcing a State court order it had \n     obtained that removed an African-American member of that \n     city's board of selectmen from his seat by changing the \n     requirements for holding that office, holding that the order \n     clearly altered the pre-existing practice. The court ordered \n     the selectman restored to his office and enjoined the city \n     from enforcing the change unless preclearance was obtained. \n     This is Robert McDuff, ``Voting Rights in Mississippi: 1982-\n     2006,'' RenewTheVRA.org at 8.\n       In 1991 the Concordia Parish Police Jury in Louisiana \n     announced that it would reduce its size from 9 seats to 7, \n     with the intended consequence of eliminating one African-\n     American district, claiming the reduction was necessary as a \n     cost-saving measure. However, DOJ noted in its objection that \n     the parish had seen no need to save money by eliminating \n     districts until an influx of African-American residents \n     transformed the district in question from a majority-white \n     district into a majority African-American district. This is \n     Debo P. Adegbile, ``Voting Rights in Louisiana: 1982-2006,'' \n     RenewTheVRA.org at 24.\n\n                              Annexations\n\n       The following are examples from the record where \n     jurisdictions changed their boundaries in order to diminish \n     the voting power of minorities by selectively changing the \n     racial composition of a district. Numerous jurisdictions have \n     annexed neighboring white suburbs in order to preserve white \n     majorities or electoral power.\n       In 1990, the city of Monroe, LA attempted to annex white \n     suburban wards to its city court jurisdiction. In its \n     objection, DOJ noted that the wards in question had been \n     eligible for annexation since 1970, but that there had been \n     no interest in annexing them until just after the first-ever \n     African-American candidate ran for Monroe city court. This is \n     Debo P. Adegbile, ``Voting Rights in Louisiana: 1982-2006,'' \n     RenewTheVRA.org at 24.\n       Pleasant Grove, Alabama was an all-white city with a long \n     history of discrimination, located in an otherwise racially \n     mixed part of Alabama. The city sought pre-clearance for two \n     annexations, one for an area of white residents who wanted to \n     attend the all-white Pleasant Grove school district instead \n     of the desegregated Jefferson County school district, the \n     other for a parcel of land that was uninhabited at the time \n     but where the city planned to build upper income housing that \n     would likely be inhabited by whites only. At the same time, \n     the city refused to annex to two predominantly black areas. \n     The United States Supreme Court upheld the District Court's \n     denial of pre-clearance. This is from City of Pleasant Grove \n     v. United States, 479 U.S. 462, 1987.\n       In 2003, the Department of Justice interposed an objection \n     to a proposed annexation in the Town of North, SC, because \n     the town had ``been racially selective in its response to \n     both formal and informal annexation requests.'' DOJ found \n     that ``white petitioners have no difficulty in annexing their \n     property to the town'' while ``town officials provide little, \n     if any, information or assistance to black petitioners and \n     often fail to respond to their requests, whether formal or \n     informal, with the result that the annexation efforts of \n     black persons fail.'' Though the town argued that no formal \n     attempts had been made by African-Americans to be annexed \n     into the town, DOJ's investigation revealed that at least one \n     petition had been signed by a significant number of African-\n     American residents who sought annexation. The fact that the \n     town ignored or was non-responsive to the requests of \n     African-Americans, while accommodating the requests of \n     whites, led DOJ to determine that race was ``an overriding \n     factor in how the town responds to annexation requests.'' \n     This is a Letter from R.

Mr. President, today I recognize a community in \nNorth Dakota that recently celebrated its 125th anniversary. On June \n23-25, the residents of Sheldon gathered to celebrate their community's \nhistory and founding.\n  Sheldon is a small town located in the eastern part of North Dakota. \nPreviously named Jenksville, E.E. Sheldon bought the land in June 1881 \nand renamed it after himself. On July 20 of that same year, a new post \noffice was established with Karl E. Rudd as the first postmaster. The \nNational Pacific Railroad arrived in Sheldon in 1882, and the village \nbegan to grow, becoming incorporated in 1884. Since the day of its \nfounding, the community has been small but very active.\n  Shortly after its founding Sheldon established itself as a hotbed for \namateur baseball, winning the state title in 1895. In addition, Lynn \nBernard ``Line Drive'' Nelson, 1905-1955, born and raised in Sheldon, \nplayed major league baseball during the 1930's with the Chicago Cubs, \nthe Philadelphia Athletics, and Detroit Tigers.\n  The community had a wonderful weekend celebration to commemorate its \n125th anniversary. The celebration was highlighted by a full day of \nactivities on Saturday, including a pancake breakfast, two parades, a \ntractor and pick-up pull, and a car show. The day was capped off by a \nstreet dance that night. In addition to those festivities, a quilt show \nand a room celebrating the history of the town were open all weekend. \nThe celebration concluded on Sunday with an all-faiths service followed \nby a brunch.\n  Mr. President, I ask the U.S. Senate to join me in congratulating \nSheldon, ND, and its residents on their first 125 years and in wishing \nthem well through the next century. By honoring Sheldon and all the \nother historic small towns of North Dakota, we keep the great \npioneering frontier spirit alive for future generations. It is places \nsuch as Sheldon that have helped to shape this country into what it is \ntoday, which is why this fine community is deserving of our \nrecognition.\n  Sheldon has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/18/senate-section/article/S7750-3", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               125TH ANNIVERSARY OF COLFAX, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a \ncommunity in North Dakota that will be celebrating its 125th \nanniversary. On July 22, the residents of Colfax will gather to \ncelebrate their community's history and founding.\n  Colfax was founded in 1881 and was proudly named after former Vice \nPresident Schulyer Colfax, who had owned property in the area. In \nFebruary 1881, Colfax's post office was established. Colfax became \nknown as the ``Fountain City'' because of the numerous artesian wells \nthat can be found in the community and the surrounding areas.\n  Today, Colfax remains a small, proud community. Each year, the \ncommunity gathers together and has picnics in the park. During the \nsummer, many of its residents can be found at the local pool, catching \nup with friends and family.\n  To celebrate the 125th anniversary of its founding, the residents of \nColfax will gather on July 22. There will be an all-school reunion to \nallow former classmates to reunite with each other and a coffee social \nat the local church. The highlight of the celebration will be the \nparade, which will feature floats, horses, and this years' North Dakota \nnine-man football state champs--all of whom are residents of Colfax.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Colfax, \nND, and its residents on their first 125 years and in wishing them well \nthrough the next century. By honoring Colfax and all the other historic \nsmall towns of North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering frontier \nspirit alive for future generations. It is places such as Colfax that \nhave helped to shape this country into what it is today, which is why \nthis fine community is deserving of our recognition.\n  Colfax has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/18/senate-section/article/S7750-4", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING MARIO KAVCIC\n\n Mr. DeWINE.

Mr. \n     Kavcic's outstanding work to preserve and promote the rich \n     heritage and culture of the Slovenian community is a shining \n     example of the positive role the press can play in our \n     society.\n       On this, the 18th Day of July, 2006.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/18/senate-section/article/S7750-5", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7750-S7751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   COMMEMMORATING THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS \n                                AFFAIRS\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, and the extraordinary men and women who \nwork there to assist our Nation's veterans. Last year, the VA began a \nyear-long celebration in order to commemorate the 75th anniversary of \nthe founding of the Department. As the agency that administers \nveterans' benefits, a well-funded VA is one way our Nation honors those \nwho have served in the Armed Forces.\n  Veterans programs have a long and distinguished history stretching \nback before nationhood itself. During the conflict between the Pilgrims \nof Plymouth Colony and the Pequot Indians in 1636, a law was approved \nmandating that disabled veterans would be supported by the colony. Over \nthe course\n\n[[Page S7751]]\n\nof the next 300 years, a variety of programs designed to assist \nveterans were instituted by different administrative bodies. In 1930, \nall veterans programs were consolidated and placed under the \njurisdiction of the Veterans' Administration. Finally, in 1988, \nPresident Reagan signed legislation creating the Department of Veterans \nAffairs.\n  The mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs is ``to care for \nhim who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his \norphan,''--a quote from Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural address. The \nDepartment has five core values: commitment, excellence, people, \ncommunication, and stewardship. By upholding these core values, the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs seeks to fulfill its obligation to those \nwho have served in defense of our Nation.\n  The men and women who work at the Department of Veterans Affairs \nconstitute a group who are highly trained and deeply devoted to the \ngoals of the organization. This is true across the board but in South \nDakota particularly. The Black Hills Health Care System was designated \na top performer in the Department's fiscal year 2005 Survey of \nHealthcare Experiences of Patients. Furthermore, the Sioux Falls VA \nMedical Center has a strong track record of top notch service. For \nexample, Luella Onken, a local volunteer at the hospital, was the \nrecipient of the 2006 First Premier Bank/Premier Bankcard Spirit of \nVolunteerism Award. She volunteers 5 days a week at the medical center \nand has devoted 35,000 hours toward helping our veterans.\n  For 75 years, the Department of Veterans Affairs has done an \nexemplary job of providing quality health care, administering benefits, \nand overseeing military cemeteries for the men and women who have \nserved our country. I am proud to recognize and commend the Department \nof Veterans Affairs. The dedicated service of the men and women who \nwork at the VA is a testament to the Department's commitment to our \nveterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/18/senate-section/article/S7751-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CONGRATULATORY NOTE ON KAZAKH AMBASSADOR'S BIRTHDAY\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today, July 18th, 2006, \nAmbassador Kanat Saudabayev from Kazakhstan is congratulated on his \n60th birthday and recognized for all of his work around the world as a \ndiplomat, government official, and culture and arts leader.\n  In his work with Washington since December 2000, Ambassador \nSaudabayev has helped to build a strong relationship with the United \nStates on many levels. In 2001, Kazakhstan's positive support after \nterrorist attacks on September 11 helped extend the U.S. partnership on \nimportant issues such as energy policy, arms proliferation, the \nenvironment, and terrorism. In the past year, he and his country have \nhelped to build positive economic and educational affiliations with \nLouisiana and also have graciously donated $50,000 to two local schools \nfor rebuilding after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n  Serving in many important leadership positions before now, Ambassador \nSaudabayev was born in the Almaty region in 1946 and is now married to \nKullikhan and is privileged to have two sons, a daughter, and three \ngrandchildren. He has served as the head of the Prime Minister's Office \nin 1999 and 2000. In the 1990s he was appointed to serve as Ambassador \nto the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. He worked \nas the Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1994 for his state and signed for \nKazakhstan in NATO's Partnership for Peace Agreement. In 1991, he \nserved as Ambassador to Turkey, the last under Soviet order, and worked \nto create a new strong future for Kazakhstan in its international \nrelationships.\n  Before his diplomatic ventures, Ambassador Saudabayev had a passion \nfor and held many positions in Kazakhstan's focus on culture. Starting \nas a theatrical producer, Ambassador Saudabayev acted as chairman of \nthe State Committee of Culture, chairman of the State Film Committee, \nand Deputy Culture Minister.\n  Besides his devoted nature in working with the United States and his \nhomeland, the Ambassador's most impressive past will lead the United \nStates to not only recognize him for his past contribution to the world \nbut most likely also for his efforts to come.\n  We wish him Happy Birthday on this celebratory year and occasion \nalong with many years of health and good fortune in his future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/18/senate-section/article/S7751-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO SHARON DALY\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

A bill to amend the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to \nreauthorize and expand the New Markets Venture Capital Program, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, in 1999, President Clinton unveiled the New \nMarkets Investment Initiative to counter an unmet challenge in the 21st \ncentury: building economically vibrant communities in underserved \nplaces such as inner cities and distressed rural areas, where there is \na great need for jobs and economic development. The goal was to build a \nbridge between Wall Street and our untapped markets in Main Street \nAmerica. In that same year, Senators Paul Wellstone, Jeff Bingaman, \nPaul Sarbanes, Carl Levin, Max Cleland, and I introduced the Community \nDevelopment and Venture Capital Act to spearhead this innovative New \nMarkets initiative in the Senate. In 2000, our New Markets initiative \nwas enacted with bipartisan support in Congress as part of the \nConsolidated Appropriations Act of 2001. The New Markets Venture \nCapital Program, NMVC, which specifically promotes the creation of \nwealth and job opportunities in low-income areas, was only one part of \nthe initiative agreed to by Speaker Hastert and then-President Clinton. \nThe other elements of that agreement included the New Markets Tax \nCredits, NMTC, additional empowerment zones, and a new program: \nCommunity Renewal Zones. The overall goal of the legislation was to \nprovide a number of different approaches to alleviating poverty so that \nwe could better understand what works best. With the exception of the \nNMVC Program, all of the other programs have moved forward. However, \nthe NMVC Program has not been given the opportunity, the funding, or \nthe support to reach its full potential as Congress intended.\n  The NMVC Program has had many successes since its inception 5 years \nago. CEI Community Ventures, Inc. from Maine--close to my home State of \nMassachusetts--has invested venture capital funds in Look's Gourmet \nFood Company, which manufactures and sells all-natural, high-quality, \nshelf-stable seafood products under the ``Bar Harbor T'' and ``Atlantic \nT'' brands. Another example can be found in Vermont, where Carolyn \nCooke and Poppy Gall founded Juno Rising/Isis Women's Apparel, an \noutdoor clothing company targeting the needs of today's active women. \nTheir products can be found in outdoor stores throughout the country.\n  Today, I rise to introduce legislation that will not only reauthorize \nthe New Markets Venture Capital Program for 3 years, but will provide \ncritical components for success: providing appropriate funding \nauthorization levels, expanding the NMVC program into all regions of \nthe country, encouraging investment in small manufacturers, making the \nNMVC Program consistent with the NMTC as Congress intended, \nincorporating the operational assistance grant model from the Rural \nBusiness Investment Program, and establishing a long-overdue Office of \nNew Markets Venture Capital. The legislation is a companion to H.R. \n4303, introduced by Representatives Gwen Moore of Wisconsin and Hal \nRogers of Kentucky. While few differences exist between our bills, both \nsend a clear legislative signal that there is strong bipartisan and \nbicameral support from Congress to reauthorize this program.\n  Mr. President, this program has a history of strong bipartisan \nsupport. In fiscal year 2001, together we appropriated $150 million for \ndebenture guarantees and $30 million in grant financing to support up \nto 15 NMVC companies. Unfortunately, only half of this money was \nobligated to support 6 NMVC companies, and the remaining funds were \nrescinded in the Fiscal Year 2003 Omnibus Appropriations Act Conference \nReport. Now today this program faces further challenges with the \nPresident's Fiscal Year 2007 budget request asking for no funding for \nthe NMVC Program. This is the sixth year in a row the President has not \nbacked this program, although Congress restored funding in 2002 and \ninitially provided funding in 2003. The Small Business \nAdministration's, SBA's, failure to obligate the remaining funds and \nthe President's lack of support for funding the NMVC Program raises an \nimportant question: Has the challenge in the 21st century of improving \nlocal economies in low-income urban and rural communities been met? All \nevidence says no. A 2006 report on America's Children by the Federal \nInteragency Forum on Child and Family Statistics stated that in 2004, \n17 percent of children live in poverty--a total of 12.5 million. In \naddition, 42 percent of children with single mothers and one in three \nAfrican-American children live in poverty. The Bureau of Labor \nStatistics shows that in areas such as Flint, MI, where the NMVC has \nnot yet had the time or resources to reach, the unemployment rate is at \n7.3 percent, well above the national average of 4.6\n\n[[Page S7763]]\n\npercent. Congress must use this reauthorization process as an \nopportunity to stimulate business activity in all communities and \ncreate jobs for low-income residents throughout the entire country.\n\n  Prior to the creation of the NMVC Program, Congress attempted to fill \nthis unmet need through various programs. In fact, Congress created the \nNMVC Program based on the SBA's Small Business Investment Company \nProgram, SBIC. Since its beginning in 1958, the SBIC Program has \nprovided approximately $46 billion of long-term debt and equity capital \nto more than 99,000 small U.S. companies. Although the SBIC Program has \nbeen popular, it does not sufficiently reach the underserved areas of \nour country that need economic development the most. The NMVC is \ntargeted specifically to very low-income areas, including historically \nunderutilized business zones--HUB Zones--and low-income rural and urban \nneighborhoods, which are overlooked by traditional venture capital \ninvestors. I do not have an NMVC Company in my State, and I am sure \nthat many Sates, like Massachusetts, could benefit from the \nopportunities that the NMVC creates. To ensure that the NMVC Program \nexpands into diverse areas around the country, the legislation \nencourages the SBA Administrator to establish not fewer than one \ncompany from each of the 10 geographic regions of the country. In \naddition to diversifying the geographic distribution of NMVC companies \nto our underserved communities, there is a great need to diversify the \ntypes of investments approved by the SBA, particularly in the area of \nmanufacturing. According to a 2004 study by the U.S. Department of \nCommerce, the most recent recession in the business cycle hit U.S. \nmanufacturers and their workers hardest--a downturn that first was felt \nin 2000. The manufacturing community lost 2.6 million jobs, accounting \nfor all of the net job losses from the fourth quarter of 2000 through \nthe third quarter of 2003. Much of the manufacturing sector continues \nto operate well below its previous peak and potential. For example, in \nplaces such as Milwaukee, where in 2002, according to the Bureau of \nLabor Statistics, 59 percent of working-age African-American males were \neither unemployed or out of the workforce. Milwaukee has also lost \n33,000 manufacturing jobs in the past 5 years. We need to do all we can \nto bring back these lost manufacturing jobs, and the NMVC Program could \nplay a role. Relying on the market to bring venture capital funding to \nMilwaukee and other manufacturing hubs is not the solution. According \nto a study by the University of Kansas, Milwaukee ranks 49th out of the \n50 largest U.S. cities in terms of venture capital dollars. Imagine the \ndifference that a venture capital investment could make in this area, \ncreating one job for every $15,000 invested.\n\n  As I mentioned previously, this legislation is a companion to the \nbipartisan legislation introduced by Representatives Moore and Rogers \nin the House. Both of our bills include small manufacturers in the \nmission of the program, by encouraging the SBA Administrator to select \nat least one NMVC company that is primarily involved in the investment \nand development of small manufacturing firms.\n  Mr. President, the legislation also makes the NMVC Program and the \nNMTC consistent in defining low-income geographic areas. Both programs \nwere designed to work together--the NMTC was intended to be a tool to \nencourage NMVC companies to raise private investment capital in low-\nincome communities. Conforming their definitions will assure a smooth \ncoordination between the two programs for future investors.\n  The nexus between the NMVC Program and the NMTC is only one aspect \nthat makes this program unique among all of the SBA's programs. Another \nunique aspect is the operational assistance grant program that fund \nmanagers can use to assist entrepreneurs in low-income communities to \ndevelop a business plan, manage employees, or market their products and \nservices. These grants are an essential tool for fostering community \ndevelopment using venture capital firms because investors are able to \nreach out into communities not served by conventional investors. Many \nof the NMVC companies are also members of the surrounding community, \ntherefore, they will have the local expertise and guidance for \nentrepreneurs to start and sustain a viable business. Some NMVC \ncompanies are having a difficult time meeting the SBA requirement that \neach company raise an upfront dollar-for-dollar match in order to \nobtain an operational assistance grant. To avoid this unnecessary \nburden, the legislation incorporates a provision modeled after the \njoint SBA/Department of Agriculture Rural Business Investment Program \nwhich does not require a match from the company and limits the amount \nof the grant.\n  Mr. President, these improvements to the NMVC Program are important \nbut they cannot be implemented without dedicated staff at the SBA. In \nOctober 2005, I wrote a letter to the SBA expressing my concern about \nthe lack of staffing and resources devoted to the NMVC office within \nthe SBA's Investment Division. The SBA informed me that staff members \nwithin the Office of SBIC Operations were getting cross-trained on the \nNMVC Program to ensure adequate staffing and provide ample support to \nmeet the needs of the six NMVC companies currently assigned to the \nOffice of New Markets Venture Capital within the SBIC Program. \nReshuffling SBA staff to assist six companies is not sufficient. If \nthis program grows to its originally intended potential of 15 \ncompanies, there needs to be staff dedicated solely to administering \nthe NMVC Program. This legislation establishes an Office of New Markets \nVenture Capital within the Investment Division of the SBA, headed by a \nDirector appointed by the SBA Administrator. The Director would be \nresponsible for administering and encouraging investment in small \nmanufacturing firms and working to expand the number of small \nbusinesses participating in the NMVC Program.\n  This bill is urgently needed now to expand the good work of the NMVC \nProgram, and I urge all of my colleagues to show their support for the \nsmall but growing number of businesses that promise both financial \nreturns for their investors and social returns to low-income people and \ndistressed regions in which they invest. This double bottom line \ndistinguishes the NMVC Program from any other SBA program, and we \ncannot afford to let it expire.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Craig, Mr. Pryor, \n        Mr. Allard, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Burns, Mr. Bond, Mr. Chambliss, \n        Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Crapo, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Hagel, Mr. \n        Lott, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Talent, Mr. Thomas, Mr. \n        Thune, Mr. Burr, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, and Ms. Landrieu).\n  S. 3681. A bill to amend the Comprehensive Environmental Response \nCompensation and Liability Act of 1980 to provide that manure shall not \nbe considered to be a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nAgricultural Protection and Prosperity Act of 2006. I would like to \nthank my colleagues from both sides of the aisle for their support by \ncosponsoring this important legislation.\n  The Agricultural Protection and Prosperity Act of 2006 seeks to \nclarify the original intent of the Comprehensive Environmental \nResponse, Compensation, and Liability Act, CERCLA, by providing an \nexemption for manure derived from agricultural operations. This \nclarification is badly needed in order to protect America's agriculture \nindustry from onerous and frivolous lawsuits. Without clarification, \nagriculture operations could be fined up to $27,500 per day per \nviolation, thereby bankrupting many livestock operations in this \ncountry. American livestock operations are already some of the most \nregulated businesses with regards to environmental quality. Additional \nrequirements and liability under CERCLA, which is designed to clean up \ntoxic industrial pollutants, is unwarranted and unfair for America's \nfarmers.\n  Agriculture has been the backbone of this country since its inception \nand we owe our farmers a debt of gratitude. However, in an environment \nwhere our farmers and ranchers are struggling to\n\n[[Page S7764]]\n\ncompete on the international stage, it seems unconscionable that some \npeople wish to place them at a further disadvantage.\n  This clarification is especially important for New Mexico's dairy \nindustry. This relatively new sector of our economy has grown by leaps \nand bounds over the years to a point where it contributes substantially \nto the overall economic output of my great State. On a national level, \nNew Mexico enjoys one of the largest average herd sizes and per capita \nmilk production in the country. This dramatic increase benefits many \nrelated businesses from the alfalfa growers along the Rio Grande to the \nimplement salesman in our small towns. However, this growth and the \nfuture of the dairy industry in New Mexico are in great jeopardy. If \nthis clarification to CERCLA is not made, the resulting dairy closures \nand the effects on related industries would devastate my State.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3681\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this \n     Act $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2007 and such sums as may be \n     necessary for each of the 4 succeeding fiscal years.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator \nAlexander, in introducing legislation\n\n[[Page S7766]]\n\nthat would create the America's Opportunity Scholarships for Kids. \nFirst proposed by President Bush, this legislation will provide \nchildren who are in schools designated for restructuring with \nscholarships either for the cost of tuition at a private school or for \nsustained, supplemental educational services.\n  The No Child Left Behind Act set up a structure for schools to get \nevaluated annually to determine whether they are meeting adequate \nyearly progress. Schools are designated for restructuring after 6 years \nof poor student academic achievement. Children are often trapped in \nthese circumstances, and this legislation will help provide them with \neither a way out or additional services to increase their academic \nachievement levels.\n  I believe that the America's Opportunity Scholarships for Kids will \nprovide true school choice across the country.\n  Competitiveness and innovation are two of the latest buzz words that \nsurround education. I believe that school choice will breed both \ncompetitiveness and innovation.\n  A few years ago I read an article by Maurice McTigue, now a professor \nat George Mason University. Mr. McTigue was the equivalent of the \nSecretary of Transportation in New Zealand when their government \nunderwent a radical transformation. During that time New Zealand's \ngovernment was decentralized, with most control and money going to \nlocal areas. This included the education system.\n  Rather than having money go directly to the schools, the money \nfollowed the children. The government set specific dollar amounts for \neach child, depending on whether the child had special needs, and that \nmoney was given to the school of the child's parents' choice.\n  This truly radical change caused great uproar at the time, as \neveryone believed that it would lead to the destruction of the public \nschool system. During the first few years of this new system, \nenrollment in public schools did decline slightly. However, because \neach public school was allowed to change and meet the needs of its \nlocal students, parents eventually moved back to their home schools.\n  Now, public school enrollment is at an all-time high in New Zealand. \nWhy? Because schools were forced to compete among themselves without \nartificial governmental barriers. Parents were allowed to choose the \nschool that best fit their child's needs.\n  I believe the same thing would happen in the United States if school \nchoice were made available across the country. In fact, two studies by \nHarvard researchers have shown that, as the voucher program in \nMilwaukee was expanded, there was a marked improvement in test scores \nat the public schools most threatened by the program. Students in these \npublic schools have benefited from competition.\n  In Milwaukee, the choice program caused the public school system to \nshift power from a centralized administration to each individual \nschool. This shift allowed parents and teachers to make decisions, \nincluding who could teach at the school.\n  Elementary and secondary education is one of the few sectors in this \ncountry that does not have open competition. By contrast, our higher \neducation system has flourished because of competition.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to provide low-income children who \nare in schools that have consistently not met adequate yearly progress \nbenchmarks, and have not improved student academic achievement, with \nother options.\n  This legislation would provide low-income students and their parents \nwith two options. First, these students would have the option of a \n$4,000 scholarship that would be applied to the cost of tuition at the \nprivate school of their parent's choice. If parents decide not to take \nthe scholarship, their child would be eligible for up to $3,000 of \nintensive, sustained supplemental educational services. Supplemental \neducational services are services that are provided outside of the \nregular school day, such as after or before school, that are designed \nto improve academic achievement.\n  I believe that this legislation is the next step toward bringing true \ncompetition to elementary and secondary education.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join Senator Alexander and me in \nsupporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLEN (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 3684. A bill to study and promote the use of energy efficient \ncomputer servers in the United States; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the Senator from \nVirginia as an original cosponsor of legislation to study and promote \nthe use of energy efficient computer servers in the United States. The \ngrowth of the Internet and online applications and the strong demand \nfor electronic transactions are creating a growing need for data \ncenters. Most data center equipment is composed of servers, which are \ncomputers that share resources with other computers on a network.\n  The average annual power and cooling bill for 100 servers is about \n$40,000--from Computer World, February 6, 2006. The U.S. server market \nis expected to grow from 2.8 billion servers in 2005 to 4.9 billion in \n2009. Without improved efficiency, data center power costs could easily \novertake hardware costs in the next few years--A. Fanara, EPA, \ntechnical workshop on server benchmarking, March 27, 2006.\n  Our bill would require the Administrator of EPA to study and analyze \nthe growth and energy consumption of computer data centers. A critical \ngoal of the study is to develop a standard way to measure server \nefficiency. Energy efficient servers and data center designs are \ncurrently available.

and\n       Whereas both Hezbollah and Hamas refuse to recognize \n     Israel's right to exist and call for the destruction of \n     Israel: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) reaffirms its steadfast support for the State of \n     Israel;\n       (2) supports Israel's right of self-defense and Israel's \n     right to take appropriate action to deter aggression by \n     terrorist groups and their state sponsors;\n       (3) urges the President to continue fully supporting Israel \n     as Israel exercises its right of self-defense in Lebanon and \n     Gaza;\n       (4) calls for the immediate and unconditional release of \n     Israeli soldiers who are being held captive by Hezbollah or \n     Hamas;\n       (5) condemns the Governments of Iran and Syria for their \n     continued support for Hezbollah and Hamas, and holds the \n     Governments of Syria and Iran responsible for the acts of \n     aggression carried out by Hezbollah and Hamas against Israel;\n       (6) condemns Hamas and Hezbollah for exploiting civilian \n     populations as shields and locating their military activities \n     in civilian areas;\n       (7) urges the President to use all available political and \n     diplomatic means, including sanctions, to persuade the \n     governments of Syria and Iran to end their support of \n     Hezbollah and Hamas;\n       (8) calls on the Government of Lebanon to do everything in \n     its power to find and free the kidnapped Israeli soldiers \n     being held in its territory, and to fulfill its \n     responsibility under United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 1559 (adopted September 2, 2004) to disband and \n     disarm Hezbollah;\n       (9) calls on the United Nations Security Council to condemn \n     these unprovoked acts and to demand compliance with \n     Resolution 1559, which requires that Hezbollah and other \n     militias be disbanded and disarmed, and that all foreign \n     forces be withdrawn from Lebanon; and\n       (10) urges all sides to protect innocent civilian life and \n     infrastructure and strongly supports the use of all \n     diplomatic means available to free the captured Israeli \n     soldiers.\n       (11) recognizes that thousands of American nationals reside \n     peacefully in Lebanon, and that those American nationals in \n     Lebanon concerned for their safety should receive the full \n     support and assistance of the United States government.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to rise as a cosponsor of \nthis resolution condemning Hezbollah and its state sponsors, and \nsupporting Israel's exercise of its right to self-defense.\n  On July 12 Hezbollah militants launched an attack into northern \nIsrael, killing seven Israeli soldiers and kidnapping two soldiers to \nhold hostage in Lebanon. On June 25, despite Israel's evacuation of \nGaza almost a year ago, Hamas entered sovereign Israeli territory, \nattacked an Israeli military base, killed two Israeli soldiers and \nkidnapped one, who is still being held captive.\n  Hezbollah and Hamas are terrorist organizations supported by Syria \nand Iran. The Senate is on the record demanding that Syria and Iran \nabandon their sponsorship of terrorism, with legislation including the \nSyria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003 \nand the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996. Syria, Iran, and the \nHezbollah terrorists that these states sponsor are responsible for the \ncurrent violence in the Middle East. The kidnapping of Israeli soldiers \nfrom Israeli soil and the exploitation of civilian populations as \nshields are provocations to which any sovereign nation would be \nobligated to react. Israel has every right to respond to protect her \ncitizens.\n  These terrorists must be stopped. Terrorists destroy lives. They \ndestroy hope. They destroy the opportunity for peace. The independent \nmilitias in Lebanon must be dismantled and withdrawn. The Lebanese \ngovernment must take steps to comply with United Nations Security \nCouncil Resolution 1559 and disarm the Hezbollah forces operating \nwithin its territory. The Israeli soldiers being held captive by \nHezbollah or Hamas must be released immediately and unconditionally.\n  I urge President Bush to use all available political and diplomatic \nmeans to persuade the governments of Syria and Iran to end their \nsupport of Hezbollah and Hamas. We are united in our rejection and \ncondemnation of the heinous acts of Hezbollah and Hamas and the \ngovernments of Syria and Iran are supporting them.\n  We are also united, Mr. President, in our steadfast support for \nIsrael and Israel's right to self-defense. Israel is one of our closest \nallies. As Americans, we share with Israel both strategic interests and \nmoral values. Today I am proud to stand with the people of Israel and \nsupport their right to defend themselves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/18/senate-section/article/S7767-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7767-S7768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 535--COMMENDING THE PATRIOT GUARD RIDERS FOR \nSHIELDING MOURNING MILITARY FAMILIES FROM PROTESTERS AND PRESERVING THE \n              MEMORY OF FALLEN SERVICE MEMBERS AT FUNERALS\n\n  Mr. CONRAD (for himself, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Allen, Mr. \nBrownback, Mr. Lott, Mr. Dorgan, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Carper, and Mr. \nTalent) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 535\n\n       Whereas in 2005, a small group of American Legion Riders in \n     Kansas calling themselves the ``Patriot Guard'' began a \n     movement to shield the families and friends of fallen service \n     members from interruptions by protesters appearing at \n     military funerals;\n       Whereas individuals from Colorado, Oklahoma, and Texas \n     later brought together diverse groups of motorcycle \n     organizations across the country who rode to honor fallen \n     service members, forming an organization known as the \n     ``Patriot Guard Riders'';\n       Whereas the Patriot Guard Riders have since grown into a \n     nationwide network, including both veterans and nonveterans \n     and riders and nonriders, and is open to anyone who shares a \n     respect for service members who have made the ultimate \n     sacrifice for the Nation;\n       Whereas Patriot Guard Riders attend military funerals to \n     show respect for fallen service members and to shield \n     mourning family members and friends of the deceased from \n     protestors who interrupt, or threaten to interrupt, the \n     dignity of the event;\n       Whereas across the Nation, Patriot Guard Riders volunteer \n     their time to come to the aid of military families in need, \n     so as to allow the memories of the deceased service member to \n     be remembered with honor and dignity;\n       Whereas regardless of one's opinion of the Nation's \n     military commitments, the families, friends, and communities \n     of the Nation's fallen soldiers deserve a peaceful time of \n     mourning and should not be harassed and caused further \n     suffering at a funeral;\n       Whereas Patriot Guard Riders appear at a funeral only at \n     the invitation of the fallen soldier's family and participate \n     in a nonviolent, legal manner; and\n       Whereas the members of the Nation's Armed Forces willingly \n     risk their lives to protect the American way of life and the \n     freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate expresses its deepest \n     appreciation to the Patriot Guard Riders who--\n       (1) attend military funerals across the country to show \n     respect for fallen members of the Armed Forces and, when \n     needed, shield mourning family members and friends of the \n     deceased from protestors who interrupt, or threaten to \n     interrupt, the dignity of a funeral; and\n       (2) in so doing, help to preserve the memory and honor of \n     the Nation's fallen heroes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today Senator Roberts is joining me as I \nsubmit a resolution to commend the Patriot Guard Riders for all they \nhave done to honor our Nation's fallen heroes and bring comfort to \nthese soldiers' friends and family members.\n  The Patriot Guard Riders was established in August of 2005 when the \nAmerican Legion Riders Chapter 136 from Kansas learned that the \nWestboro\n\n[[Page S7768]]\n\nBaptist Church was planning to protest at the funeral of SGT John Doles \nin Chelsea, OK. The Patriot Guard Riders have since grown into a \nnational network of tens of thousands of members who share a respect \nfor service members who have made the ultimate sacrifice.\n  The group's mission is to show their sincere respect for our fallen \nheroes, their families, and their communities. Patriot Guard members \nattend funerals after being invited by the family of the fallen \nsoldier. At the funeral they form a human shield to protect grieving \nfamily members and friends from protesters.\n  I was recently at the funerals for North Dakota soldiers, and I was \nappalled--absolutely appalled--by the behavior of protesters who used \nthe funeral to convey their twisted message of hatred for our soldiers \nand their families. These protests do a grave disservice to the men and \nwomen who have courageously served our country and paid the ultimate \nsacrifice. They and their families deserve privacy and our profound \nrespect.\n  In addition to attending fallen soldiers' funerals, and send offs, \nand welcome home ceremonies, the Patriot Guard Riders also visit \ncritically wounded soldiers in hospitals and help them become \nassimilated back into civilian life. The group has also started the \nFallen Warrior Scholarship Fund, a scholarship established to send \nfallen soldiers' children to college.\n  Our colleagues in the House passed a similar piece of legislation, H. \nRes. 731, on June 20. We should join them in expressing the Senate's \ndeepest appreciation to the Patriot Guard Riders who help to preserve \nthe memory and dignity of the Nation's fallen heroes. The resolution I \nam submitting today does just that. It expresses the Senate's ``deepest \nappreciation to the Patriot Guard Riders who shield mourning family \nmembers and friends of the deceased from protesters who interrupt, or \nthreaten to interrupt, the dignity of a funeral; and in so doing, help \nto preserve the memory and dignity of the Nation's fallen heroes.''\n  All across the Nation, and in my own State of North Dakota, Patriot \nGuard Riders are protecting mourning families from further hurt. For \nthat, they deserve our sincere gratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/18/senate-section/article/S7768-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4676.
