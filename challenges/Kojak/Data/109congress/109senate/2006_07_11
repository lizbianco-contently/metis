Mr. President, I wish to take a few moments to comment on \nsome very good news the administration is releasing right now as I \nspeak.\n  As required by law, the administration today releases its updated \nestimates for this year's Federal budget. Compared to their estimate \nlast winter that the Federal deficit would top $423 billion, today's \nnews that the deficit will decline to $296 billion is a testament to a \ndynamic and growing U.S. economy. That is 30 percent less than what had \nbeen forecast in just February.\n  It is an economy that exceeds $13 trillion today, the largest of any \ncountry in the world. It is an economy with an annual growth rate that \nhas consistently exceeded that of the other advanced economies around \nthe world--England, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, and, indeed, the \nentire Euro area. It is an economy that has grown $3.2 trillion since \nthe end of 2000. It is an economy battered by corporate scandals, the \nterrible devastation wrought by September 11, and the worst natural \ndisaster in centuries to visit our shores. It is an economy that has \ngrown despite the more than tripling of oil prices in less than 5 \nyears.\n  All this while fighting an ongoing battle to defeat global terrorism.\n  It is an economy that has grown steadily for the last 4 years and 8 \nmonths. It is an economy that has experienced job growth every month \nfor the last 34 consecutive months and added over 5.4 million jobs \nsince September 2003. It is an economy that provided 151 million \nAmericans jobs just last month--the largest ever in history. It is an \neconomy with a 4.6 percent unemployment rate last month\n\n[[Page S7290]]\n\nwhich was below the average of the 1960s, below the average of the \n1970s, below the average of the 1980s, and below the average of the \n1990s.\n  In short, it is an economy that has grown because of the grit and \nspine of the American worker, whose productivity exceeds that of all \nothers. It has also grown because of explicit policies designed to \nlower tax burdens on the American public, to reduce the burdens of \nunnecessary and costly Government regulations, to limit the growth of \nunnecessary Federal spending, and then to step back and let the \nAmerican workers release their great entrepreneurial competitive \nspirit.\n  The result: For the first 9 months of this fiscal year, total \nGovernment receipts rose by nearly 13 percent compared to the same \nperiod last year. That increase represents the second highest rate of \ngrowth for that 9-month period in the past 25 years, surpassed only by \nlast year's strong record. Corporate tax receipts have grown over 26 \npercent, and individual tax receipts have grown 14 percent the first 9 \nmonths of this year.\n  When this strong growth in tax receipts is laid alongside spending \nthat has grown about half as fast, it is no wonder the estimates \nreleased today show the Federal deficit declining rapidly.\n  We are making progress to bring our spending and revenue into line. \nDespite the cost of the Global War on Terrorism, despite the drain to \nour Treasury from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and increasing costs of \nour health care system, we are making progress.\n  More needs to be done, and we cannot rest on the progress made to \ndate. We must continue to limit the growth of unnecessary, parochial \nspending in the Federal budget. We must continue to find ways to lower \nthe cost of providing health care to our seniors and to workers and \ntheir families. We must find new sources of energy for the future. We \nmust invest the taxpayers' dollars wisely in those areas which will \ncontinue to increase our competitive advantage in a growing, \ncompetitive global economy. We must continue to lower tax burdens on \nfamilies and businesses so they can plan, invest, and continue to \ncontribute to a growing economy in the years ahead. We must do all this \nand more while continuing to strive to achieve fiscal balance. Today's \nfigures confirm for me that we can and we will achieve these blessings \nfor future generations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/11/senate-section/article/S7290-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was not planning on speaking today, but I \nmust respond to the distinguished majority leader's comments about what \nis happening to our economy.\n  One need only look at a newspaper. It doesn't matter which newspaper \none picks up. The one I picked up in the cloakroom is the Washington \nPost business section. The headline of the Washington Post business \nsection reads:\n\n       Tax Cuts Credited; Long-Term Outlook Still Seen as Bleak.\n\n  And you flip down through the article, it says, among other things:\n\n       But the favorable news about the money rolling into the \n     Treasury stems largely from shifts in the economy, including \n     fatter corporate profits, executive bonuses and stock market \n     gains, that reflect growing inequality, the administration's \n     critics contend. And even the White House acknowledges that \n     in the long run, the nation's fiscal outlook [seems very] \n     bleak.\n\n  We need only look on the next page where the story is carried over:\n\n       The administration's estimate was widely derided at the \n     time; budget experts said aides to President Bush were \n     overestimating the red ink so they could claim credit later \n     when the actual figures came in below forecast.\n\n  This is what they did. Earlier in the year, they talked about how big \nthe deficit would be, and they planned that because everyone knew the \ndeficit would be smaller than that. Smaller? Mr. President, $300 \nbillion--is that anything to brag about? I think not.\n\n  The news article further says:\n\n       But revenue often soars or plummets unpredictably with the \n     stock market, and a troubling story emerges from a look at \n     the main sources of the latest revenue bonanza, according to \n     the administration's critics.\n       ``This all relates to the widening income disparities \n     between high-income individuals and the rest of the \n     population. . . .''\n\n  Our economy is not in good shape. The distinguished majority leader \nbrags about 5.5 million jobs having been created. During the \nadministration of President Clinton, 23 million jobs were created. We \nwent months during this administration when no new jobs were created. \nDuring the years of President Clinton, 23 million new jobs were \ncreated, and they were high-quality jobs.\n  During the last 3 years of the Clinton administration, we didn't have \na $300 billion deficit that people are bragging about today on the \nSenate floor. We paid down the debt. We spent less money than we were \ntaking in. We brought down the national debt by about a half trillion \ndollars.\n  So, please, let's not boast about a $300 billion deficit. Any \nstatistic one looks at recognizes the rich in America are getting \nricher, the poor are getting poorer, and the middle class is being \nsqueezed. I hope some reality will come to the situation we find now on \nthe Senate floor where the majority leader is bragging about how great \nit is that we have a $300 billion deficit. I don't think that is good \nnews. I think it is bad news.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/11/senate-section/article/S7290-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I thank my leader on the Democratic side.\n  Yesterday I visited Guantanamo Bay, along with my colleague, Senator \nGeorge Allen of Virginia. RADM Harry Harris, commander of the Joint \nTask Force in Guantanamo, spent most of his day giving us a very \ninformative briefing and a tour of the facilities.\n  I thank the admiral, and I thank all the soldiers and sailors at \nGuantanamo for their service to our country. They are great Americans \ndoing a difficult job in a dangerous place.\n  I met with several young men and women from Illinois. I had lunch \nwith them. As I always do, I left with even greater respect for our men \nand women in uniform. They are truly our best. They deserve our \ngratitude every single day.\n  I am old enough to remember the Vietnam war. It was a divisive war \npolitically, and our divisions were taken out on the soldiers. That \nshould never happen again. We can debate the policies of the United \nStates on the floor of the Senate, but we should never debate the \ncourage and commitment of our men and women in uniform. It is beyond \nreproach.\n  For some time, I have been critical of the Bush administration's \npolicies on interrogation and detention. I believe these policies are \nnot true to American values. They have hurt our efforts in the war on \nterrorism. They put our brave men and women in uniform at even greater \nrisk.\n  Let me be clear. My criticism of the administration's policies does \nnot reflect in any way on the fine men and women in the military. In \nfact, I think the Bush administration's policies in many case have done \na disservice to our military. The men and women serving at Guantanamo \nhave a difficult job. The administration's confusing, conflicting, and, \naccording to the recent Supreme Court decision, illegal policies have \nmade their job even more difficult.\n  After the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Bush administration \nunilaterally decided to set aside treaties which the Senate had \nratified and which had been followed and honored by previous \nadministrations of both political parties--treaties that have served us \nwell for generations.\n\n[[Page S7291]]\n\n  Alberto Gonzales, who was then White House Counsel to the President, \nrecommended to him that the Geneva Conventions should not apply to the \nwar on terrorism. But Colin Powell, who was then Secretary of State, \nobjected to Mr. Gonzales's recommendation. He argued that we should \ncomply with the Geneva Conventions and that we could do so and still \neffectively fight the war on terrorism. In a memo to White House \nCounsel Gonzales, Secretary Powell pointed out the Geneva Conventions \ndo not limit our ability to hold and question a detainee. He also noted \nthat the Geneva Conventions do not give Prisoner of War status to \nterrorists. That was Secretary Powell's opinion.\n\n  In his memo, Secretary Powell went on to say that setting aside the \nGeneva Conventions:\n\n       will reverse over a century of U.S. policy and practice . . \n     . and undermine the protections of the law of war for our own \n     troops. . . . It will undermine public support among critical \n     allies, making military cooperation more difficult to \n     sustain.\n\n  When you look at the negative publicity about Guantanamo today, \nSecretary Colin Powell's words a few years ago were clearly prophetic.\n  Unfortunately, President Bush rejected Secretary Powell's counsel and \ninstead stood by White House Counsel Gonzales's conclusion. On February \n7, 2002, the President issued a memo dictating that the Geneva \nConventions would not apply to the war on terrorism.\n  After the President decided to ignore the Geneva Conventions, the \nadministration unilaterally created its own new detention policy. They \nclaimed the right to seize anyone, including an American citizen in the \nUnited States, and hold him until the end of the war on terrorism, \nwhenever that might be.\n  They claimed that Americans and others who were detained have no \nlegal rights. That means no right to challenge their detention, no \nright to see the evidence against them, and no right to even know why \nthey are being held.\n  In August of 2002, the Justice Department issued its infamous torture \nmemo. This memo narrowly redefined the meaning of torture. It said \nabuse only rises to the level of torture if it causes pain equivalent \nto organ failure or death. The memo also concluded the President had \nthe authority to order the use of torture, even though torture is a \ncrime under U.S. law. This became official administration policy for \nover 2 years before it was withdrawn under public pressure.\n  Relying on the President's Geneva Conventions determination and the \nJustice Department's torture memo, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld approved \nnumerous abusive interrogation tactics for use against prisoners in \nGuantanamo Bay, including threatening detainees with dogs and forcing \ndetainees into painful stress positions for long periods of time. The \nInternational Committee for the Red Cross has concluded that the use of \nthese techniques is torture.\n  What has been the impact of the Bush administration's detention and \ninterrogation policies? As a result of these policies, and despite the \nfine service of our military, Guantanamo has become a divisive, \nnegative symbol of America around the world. Even Great Britain, our \nclosest ally in the war on terrorism, has called for Guantanamo to be \nclosed. This is what Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney General of Great \nBritain, said:\n\n       Not only would it, in my personal opinion, be right to \n     close Guantanamo as a matter of principle, I believe it would \n     also help to remove what has become a symbol to many--right \n     or wrong--of injustice. The historic tradition of the United \n     States as a beacon of freedom, liberty, and of justice \n     deserves the removal of this symbol.\n\n  Some people dismiss our allies' views on Guantanamo. They say it is \nup to the United States to decide how to fight terrorism and other \ncountries should stay out of our business.\n  Of course, we need to do whatever it takes to protect America and \nkeep us safe, whatever the international criticism. But look at the \nprice we are paying for these administration policies. Our closest \nallies say it is more difficult to cooperate with the United States' \nefforts in the war on terrorism. As Lord Goldsmith said, Guantanamo is \nharming the image of the United States around the world.\n  It bears noting that in terms of lives committed to the cause, Great \nBritain was our strongest ally in the invasion of Iraq. Their judgment \non Guantanamo deserves our respect.\n  And it is not just foreign governments that have criticized the \nadministration's policies. It is also brave Americans who are fighting \non the frontlines in the war on terrorism.\n  According to a publicly released FBI memo, at least 26 FBI agents \nhave complained about abuses they witnessed at Guantanamo. According to \nthe memo, during 2002 and 2003, 17 of these agents were complaining \nabout ``DOD [Department of Defense] approved interrogation \ntechniques.'' In other words, these FBI agents were not complaining \nabout the actions of bad apples or rogue soldiers; they were \ncomplaining about tactics that were approved by the administration and \nwere used at that time, in 2002 and 2003, at Guantanamo. The concerns \nraised by the FBI are currently under investigation by the Justice \nDepartment's Inspector General.\n  When I raised these concerns yesterday at Guantanamo, before the men \nand women who are in charge of that facility, they understood what I \nwas speaking of. They referred me to the Inspector General and said \nthese matters are under investigation. One of the lead interrogators \ndrew me aside and said privately to me: I don't want to ever be part of \nthat kind of conduct. I believe him, and I respect him for what he \nsaid.\n  In addition to FBI agents, several military lawyers, known as Judge \nAdvocate Generals, have also raised serious concerns about \nadministration policies. Their concerns are found in the so-called JAG \nmemos which have been made public. For instance, Major General Jack \nRives in February 2003 said:\n\n       We have taken the legal and moral ``high road'' in the \n     conduct of our military operations regardless of how others \n     may operate. Our forces are trained in this legal and moral \n     mindset beginning the day they enter active duty . . . We \n     need to consider the overall impact of approving extreme \n     interrogation techniques as giving official approval and \n     legal sanction to the application of interrogation techniques \n     that U.S. forces have consistently been trained are unlawful.\n\n  Of course, the Supreme Court has weighed in now. In 2004, in two \nlandmark decisions, the Supreme Court rejected the administration's \ndetention policies. The Court held, as Justice Sandra Day O'Connor \nfamously wrote for the majority in the Hamdi case:\n\n       A state of war is not a blank check for the President when \n     it comes to the rights of the Nation's citizens.\n\n  Unfortunately, the administration continued to implement policies for \nthe treatment of detainees that violate the Constitution, treaties, and \nlaws of the United States.\n  Two weeks ago in the Hamdan decision, the Supreme Court again \nrejected the administration's policies. The Court held that the \nAdministration's military commissions are illegal and that the \nPresident is required to comply with the Uniform Code of Military \nJustice and the Geneva Conventions. The Supreme Court reminded the \nPresident that no man is above the law, even during a war.\n  In my estimation, the fine men and women at Guantanamo are working \nhard to overcome the damage done by the Administration's policies. For \nexample, they no longer use abusive interrogation techniques that the \nadministration approved. In fact, as the chief interrogator told me \nyesterday, the techniques currently being used at Guantanamo comply \nwith the Geneva Conventions. He said the Geneva Conventions provide \nsufficient flexibility to interrogate detainees effectively.\n  I asked the chief interrogator yesterday in Cuba at Guantanamo: If \nyou were told today that you had to follow the Geneva Conventions in \nthe way that you interrogate all of the detainees at Guantanamo, what \nwould you have to change? He said: Nothing. I said: Do you follow the \nMcCain torture amendment which passed the Senate 90 to 9? He said: We \ndo.\n  So to argue that respecting the Geneva Conventions would in any way \ndiminish our ability to interrogate these detainees is not right, at \nleast not in the mind of our chief interrogator at Guantanamo. This is \nwhat Secretary of State Colin Powell told the President 4 years ago. I \nwish the President had followed his counsel.\n  According to a report in this morning's Financial Times, in response \nto\n\n[[Page S7292]]\n\nthe Hamdan decision, the Defense Department has finally acknowledged \nthat Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions applies to all \ndetainees in U.S. military custody. If this is true, it is a belated \nbut necessary and welcome step in the right direction.\n  Our troops at Guantanamo are doing their best, but they have a heavy \nburden to carry. Every day they wake up, put on their uniforms and face \nthe challenges of performing a very difficult job. Now they face the \nadded burden of attempting to rehabilitate the image of Guantanamo.\n  Our young soldiers and sailors should not have to carry that burden \nalone. It is long past time for Congress to help. Congress must ask: \nHave we given our troops an impossible task?\n  I have come to the difficult conclusion that it is time to close \nGuantanamo. We should immediately begin phasing out the detention and \ninterrogation operations at Guantanamo Bay, with the goal of closing \nthe Guantanamo detention facilities before the end of this calendar \nyear. Even President Bush has acknowledged that Guantanamo should be \nclosed. Despite the valiant efforts of our troops, Guantanamo has \nbecome a powerful, negative symbol around the world for the failures of \nthis administration.\n  As Admiral Harris told me yesterday, many of the detainees can be \ncharged, transferred to other countries, or released. In addition, \nthere may be a continuing need to detain a small number of individuals \nwho cannot be charged with a crime, but who still pose a danger to our \ncountry. I do not believe that we should release anyone who is a danger \nto our country or a danger to our troops. It is right that we hold \nthem, if they are such a danger, in the appropriate legal fashion.\n  Of course, closing Guantanamo is just the beginning of this process. \nThere are still many serious flaws in the administration's \ninterrogation and detention policies. An example is the signing \nstatement the President added to the McCain torture amendment last \nyear, which still raises questions about what the intent of the \nadministration is when it comes to torture. The Senate spoke 90 to 9 in \na bipartisan fashion. I was proud to be a cosponsor of the McCain \namendment, which said that we will not engage in torture, cruel, \ninhuman or degrading treatment of prisoners. That should be a clear \nstandard for the United States to follow unequivocally.\n  The Supreme Court, 2 weeks ago, made it clear: We are a Nation of \nlaws, even during a war. No person in America is above the law, \nincluding the President.\n  It is time for Congress to make it clear to the President that he is \nbound by the treaties we ratify and the laws we pass, whether it is the \nGeneva Conventions, the Uniform Code of Military Justice or the McCain \ntorture amendment.\n  It is time for us to fulfill our constitutional responsibilities. Our \nbrave men and women in uniform are doing their job. Now it is time for \nCongress to do its job.\n  Mr. President, this trip yesterday was an important trip for me, \npersonally, to see Guantanamo firsthand and to meet the men and women \nwho are doing such a great job for our country. My heart goes out to \nthem because I know the sacrifice they are making to serve our Nation. \nMy heart goes out to them as well because, for the last several years, \nthey have been given conflicting messages and conflicting policies from \nthis administration. These men and women in uniform are trained to \nfollow the rule of law and the Geneva Conventions and the Uniform Code \nof Military Justice, but the conflicting policies of this \nadministration on torture and detention have created an atmosphere \nwhich is unfair to the troops and inconsistent with the values of \nAmerica.\n  It is clear now that we must close Guantanamo. It has become a \nnegative symbol of the United States around the world. We must transfer \nthose prisoners to new facilities to signal to the world that the \ndecision of the Supreme Court has charted a new course and a new \ndirection for America, that we have received this message and we must \nmove forward, and we must make it clear to the world that despite the \nthreat of terrorism, the United States will still follow the rule of \nlaw, we will follow the Geneva Conventions, we will follow the Uniform \nCode of Military Justice, and we will follow the bipartisan McCain \ntorture amendment. We must make it clear that we will keep America \nsafe, and we will also protect our values in the process.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT Pro Tempore.

Mr. President, I have in my hand a report that has been \nreleased about 12 or so minutes ago. It is a report on the fiscal year \n2007 midsession review. It is on the budget of the U.S. Government, put \nout by the Office of Management and Budget. It says pretty much what \nthe Congressional Budget Office has been telling us for the last 30 \ndays: That our tax cuts are working, the economy is strong, revenues \nare up, and deficits are down. Let me talk a little bit about the tax \ncuts and how they are bringing in additional revenues.\n  The Republican progrowth tax policies enacted in 2003 have triggered \n2\\1/2\\ years of economic growth, unprecedented tax revenue increases \nand job creation. Since the 2003 tax cuts, America has increased the \nsize of its entire economy by 20 percent or $2.2 trillion.\n  A remarkable observation was made by CNBC's Larry Kudlow over the \nweekend, which I think helps to put this in perspective:\n\n       This $2.2 trillion expansion is roughly the same size as \n     the total Chinese economy, and much larger than the total \n     economic size of nations like India, Mexico, Ireland, and \n     Belgium.\n\n  Pursuant to the extraordinary economic growth spawned by the 2003 tax \ncuts, Federal revenues have rebounded sharply following several years \nof decline. I would attribute most of this to the fact that we targeted \nreducing taxes on those industries that would create more jobs and \ncreate more revenue for the Government, particularly the small business \nsector. I think one of the greatest incentives for the economy to grow \nhas been the expensing provisions that we directed toward small \nbusiness which allowed the small business to write off a greater \npercent of their operations within 1 year. It was a huge tax benefit to \nsmall business which has resulted in a lot of increase in the number of \njobs and a lot more productivity and innovation from the small business \nsector. It is the small business sector that drives the major portion \nof our economy.\n\n  Revenues grew by a dramatic 14.5 percent last year and are forecast \nthis year to grow by $245 billion or 11.4 percent.\n  Last week, the Congressional Budget Office reported corporate tax \nreceipts for the first three quarters of this fiscal year hit $250 \nbillion, nearly 26 percent higher than the same time last year. \nCorporate tax receipts, the taxes that corporations are paying, \nincreased nearly 26 percent higher than the same time last year. The \ndeficit is down. The expanding economy is good news for the budget, \nspecifically the budget deficit.\n  This morning, the White House Office of Management and Budget \nreleased its annual midyear budget update. This year's budget deficit \nis now forecast to be $296 billion, 30 percent below the \nadministration's February forecast of $423 billion, or 3.2 percent of \ngross domestic product. This deficit represents 2.3 percent of our \neconomy, equal to the historical average. Progrowth policies, combined \nwith ongoing efforts to restrain spending, continue to reduce the \ndeficit and have put us on track to cut the deficit in half in 2008, a \nyear ahead of the President's goal.\n  Jobs are growing. Last Friday, the Department of Labor reported that \njob growth continued for the 34th consecutive month in June. The \neconomy has created about 1.85 million jobs over the past 12 months and \nmore than 5.4 million since August of 2003. Similarly, the unemployment \nrate dropped from its peak of 6.3 percent in June of 2003 to 4.6 \npercent today. To put that in perspective domestically, at 4.6 percent, \ntoday's unemployment rate is lower than the average of the 1960s, \n1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.\n  Let me repeat: Today's unemployment rate is lower than the average of \nthe last four decades.\n  To put that in perspective globally, since 2004, the United States \nhas created nearly twice the number of jobs as\n\n[[Page S7293]]\n\nthe rest of the G7 countries combined. This job growth is not isolated \nto just one part of the country. Employment increased in 48 States over \nthe past 12 months, ending in May.\n  Not only is the number of jobs on the rise, so, too, are wages. \nHourly compensation has risen 3.9 percent over the past year, while \naverage weekly earnings have grown to 4.5 percent.\n  The economy is strong, strong and poised to stay strong. The gross \ndomestic product, a broad measure of the economy, grew at an annual \nrate of 5.6 percent for the first quarter of this year. This is the \nfastest growth in 2\\1/2\\ years and even stronger than previous \nestimates. It follows economic growth of 3.5 percent in 2005, the \nfastest rate of any major industrialized nation.\n  This remarkable growth has come on the heels of the burst of the \ntechnology bubble, the devastating attacks of 9/11, corporate scandals \nand destructive natural disasters. Similar to the American people, the \neconomy has weathered the storm. The economy has done so due, in large \npart, to the Republican tax cuts and progrowth policies instituted \nsince 2001.\n  On restraining spending, the question becomes, What can we do to \ncontinue these positive trends? I believe the answer includes keeping \ntaxes low and restraining spending. We need to work harder in holding \ndown our excessive spending. With respect to the latter, I remain \ngravely concerned about the runaway growth of mandatory spending. For \nexample, 20 years ago entitlements, or mandatory spending, comprised 45 \npercent of the budget. Today they comprise nearly 60 percent of our \n$2.8 trillion budget. If left unchecked, spending on just three \nentitlement programs--Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security--will \nconsume 20 percent of our gross domestic product in just 30 years. To \nput that in perspective, the entire Government consumes 20 percent of \ngross domestic product today. Clearly, the growth is unsustainable and \nthreatens our economic well-being, as well as that of our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  I commend the Budget Committee chairman, Chairman Gregg, for his \nleadership on this issue and for introducing, along with myself and 24 \nother cosponsors, the Stop Overspending Act of 2006. This bill proposes \ntough measures to force Congress and the administration to adhere to a \ndisciplined budget process.\n  The bill includes a line-item veto, or expedited rescission process, \nto allow the President to identify items of wasteful spending and send \nthem to Congress for an up-or-down vote. It creates a new mechanism to \nessentially balance the budget by 2012. It reinstates discretionary \nspending caps in law, and it creates a bipartisan commission to \nidentify and eliminate agency duplication and programs that have \noutlived their usefulness, as well as a commission to ensure the \nsolvency of entitlement programs. It ensures a budgeting process to \nallow Congress to have more oversight, and it addresses the shadow \nbudget that has developed due to emergency spending by building \nreasonable assumptions of emergency spending into the discretionary \ncaps.\n  In conclusion, the economy is strong, progrowth economic policies \nhave fueled robust expansion which has, in turn, increased revenues at \na rapid pace. As a result, the deficit is on target to be cut in half \nby 2008, a year earlier than the President's schedule. To continue \nthese positive economic trends, we need to keep taxes low and further \nrestrain spending.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/11/senate-section/article/S7293-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            GOP TAX POLICIES\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I come to the floor amazed that our \nDemocratic colleagues still claim that tax cuts are to blame for the \nbudget deficit. In criticizing the President, they fail to mention that \nthe previous administration handed this President a recession, \ncorporate scandals, and a worldwide terror network that had gone \nunchallenged for 8 years. Now, similar to President Clinton, the \nDemocrats say we need to raise taxes.\n  This is the same, tired argument they have used since the 1980s. \nRonald Reagan answered them ably in his own humorous way when he said \ndoing away with tax cuts in order to balance the budget was ``like \ntrying to pull a game out in the fourth quarter by punting on third \ndown.''\n  Now the new midsession review is answering these tax cut critics \nagain. When we cut taxes, we invest in economic growth, which not only \ncreates jobs but brings in new tax receipts, and that helps balance the \nbudget. It also puts more money in the pockets of the American people.\n  Last year, we were happily surprised to see that the budget deficit \nfor 2005 came in at $108 billion less than anticipated due to the \nunexpected rise in tax receipts stemming from economic growth. This \nyear, we see the same trend. The midsession review states that tax \nreceipts have produced another $127 billion in new revenues. This is \nexactly the opposite of what Democrats claimed would happen when we \npassed the jobs and growth tax cut packages in 2001 and 2003. One of my \nDemocratic colleagues from Michigan said at the time that this bill \nwould ``create fewer jobs than what is needed'' and ``dramatically \nincrease the deficit and national debt. . . .''\n  Another Democratic colleague from Wisconsin justified his vote \nagainst the jobs and growth package saying: ``I am still looking for \nthe part of the package that will result in jobs and economic growth.''\n  Senators, look no further. In addition to the $235 billion total in \nnew revenues, we have created 5.4 million jobs since August of 2003. \nAnd the Democrats still say that we can't afford tax cuts.\n  Republicans and the American people know better. A shrinking deficit \nand more Americans at work are proving we can't afford to raise taxes. \nI encourage my Democratic colleagues to remember what President John F. \nKennedy--John F. Kennedy, one of their own--said, that ``the soundest \nway to raise revenues in the long run is to cut tax rates now.''\n  President Kennedy's words still ring true today. Cutting taxes allows \nworking American families to keep more of their hard-earned dollars and \nencourages businesses to be competitive and invest in future growth.\n  Both Presidents Kennedy and Reagan understood it is business, not \nGovernment, that creates jobs and prosperity. This is why Republicans \nwill continue to fight to stop future Democratic tax increases, to make \nRepublican tax relief permanent, and push for comprehensive tax reform.\n  I am pleased that this midsession review offers yet more proof that \nthe Republican's agenda to secure American jobs and balance the budget \nis working. We are making progress. It is third down and time for us to \nrun the ball for a touchdown--not punt it away.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/11/senate-section/article/S7293-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 5441, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5441) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Homeland Security for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2007, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we are now back on the Homeland Security \nbill, which is an important piece of legislation as it addresses the \nissues of how we protect our Nation and how we deal with border \nsecurity and threats involving potential weapons of mass destruction. \nIt also addresses the issue of the management of the Department of \nHomeland Security, especially in areas where there have been issues, \nprimarily--well, almost every function of\n\n[[Page S7294]]\n\nthe Department has had some issues, but the ones that have been \nhighlighted, of course, are those dealing with the Katrina catastrophe \nand FEMA's response to that. It is an important piece of legislation \nfor a variety of issues, but I want to carry on a little bit with the \ndiscussion--and then I want to yield to the Senator from Louisiana, who \nhas an amendment, but I want to continue the discussion on the issue \nwhich has been raised relative to the report that was put out today, \nthe midsession review.\n  It is important for people to understand we are functioning in a \nGovernment that has fairly significant fiscal issues. We came out of \nthe 1990s with the largest bubble in the history of this Nation, the \nInternet bubble--in the history of the world, honestly. And that bubble \nburst. That was a bubble in the tradition of the tulip bubble and the \nSouth Seas bubble, where basically people were printing money without \nany support behind it--called stocks. Stocks were being issued that had \nno value behind them. The stock value ran up, through exuberance, as \nChairman Greenspan called it, irrational exuberance. When that burst, \nit basically took out of the economy huge amounts of liquidity. That \nwas followed, of course, by the attack of 9/11, which was not only a \ncatastrophic event from the loss of life and impact on our culture but \nalso was a catastrophic event economically.\n  The President had the good sense to come forward with proposals which \nbasically tried to address the economic side of the problems which we \nwere confronting. We were headed into a very severe recession as a \nresult of those two events. He proposed tax cuts which have been, I \nthink vilified would be a kind word, from the other side of the aisle. \nHe proposed those tax cuts basically on the theory that if you reduce \nthe tax burden on the American worker to something that is fair, it \nwill generate income because you basically create more incentive for \npeople to be productive. It is human nature. Somebody is going to be \nable to take action which generates income. If they pay a very high tax \non that action, they are going to have very little incentive to take \nthat action. If they pay a reasonable and fair tax on that action, then \nthey will take that action. The capital gains cuts is a classic example \nof that, where by cutting the capital gains rate we have seen massive \namounts of economic activity that would not have occurred before when \npeople would have sat on those assets, stocks, and real estate, or \ncorporate assets. But because there was a lower and more reasonable \ncapital gains rate, people have turned those assets over, which has had \ntwo effects.\n\n  First, it generated a taxable event which generated huge amounts of \nrevenue to our Nation. In fact, the capital gains events have exceeded \nthe expected baseline for those receipts by a factor of almost $100 \nbillion over the last 2 to 3 years. Not only did they create those \nreceipts, but it also took the assets which had been locked up in maybe \nproductive assets but not as productive as they should have been and \nturned those dollars and those resources and capital investment into \nthings which would be even more productively used because when people \nsell the assets, they take what they gain and reinvest it in a way \nwhich is going to produce even more income.\n  The practical effect of that is the dollars are working more \neffectively, the economy becomes more lean and more productive, and the \nresult is even more revenue.\n  So the practical event is we have seen a huge increase as a result of \nthe tax cuts which the President put in place with the support of this \nCongress--the Republican Congress, obviously, and not from the other \nside of the aisle--we have seen a huge increase in the rate of revenue \ngrowth in this country. During the last 2 years, revenue jumped 14 \npercent last year, and it is up almost another 13 percent in the first \npart of this year.\n  The effect of that has been that we have seen receipts coming into \nthe Federal Treasury which have reduced the deficit dramatically from \nwhat was expected, down from $423 billion to below $300 billion. We are \nstill continuing on that path. It is an extraordinarily positive path.\n  Most of those receipts, ironically, come from corporate America and \nthe higher income quadrant of taxpayers in the American economic \nsystem. Those are the folks who are paying more in taxes today--from \nwhom we are getting more tax receipts. We are back to basically the \nhistorical level of tax burden in this country--around 18 percent gross \ndomestic product being raised through revenue. The problem we have \ntoday is not that we are undertaxed. In fact, we are generating a lot \nof revenue through overspending. What we need is control of spending.\n  This President has tried to do that on the nondefense discretionary \nside, but we still need to address the entitlement side of the picture \nand we need to address, obviously, how we manage catastrophes such as \nKatrina.\n  That brings me to the second point I wanted to make, and that is the \nDemocratic response to this has traditionally been to get rid of these \ntax cuts. It is pretty hard to take that position any longer because \ntax reductions are generating so much revenue. Now their position is \nthey are going to bring up Social Security, and they are going to talk \njust about Social Security. What a tired prescription that is. What a \nreflection of bankrupt ideas that is. They are once again trying to \nscare senior citizens over the issue of Social Security. That has been \ngoing on for 40 years.\n  When I was first elected to office, I talked to Tip O'Neill, who was \nSpeaker of the House at that time, about what the Republicans who were \nserving in the House in the early 1980s were going to hear during the \nnext campaign. He said we are going to hear about three things: Social \nSecurity and Social Security and Social Security.\n  That appears to be the new tactic which has been gone back to--bring \nout the bloody shirt of Social Security and wave it at the Republican \nParty while ignoring, for example, the fact that we have a very serious \nproblem in the outyears with Social Security and other retirement \nbenefits. The Social Security system has an unfunded liability of \napproximately $12 trillion over its actuarial life. That is because \nthere are many senior citizens who are going to be taking down Social \nSecurity as the baby boom generation retires.\n  What is the reaction on the other side of the aisle? Before any \ndiscussion can be pursued on the issue of Social Security, they \nimmediately bring out the bloody shirt: Republicans are going to \ndestroy Social Security; they are going to privatize Social Security; \nthey are going to try to eliminate--``savage'' was the term used by the \nDemocratic leader--savage Social Security. Where are their proposals to \naddress Social Security? Where are their proposals to address any \nentitlement reform other than to suggest that we raise taxes through \ntheir ``paygo'' proposal, which is actually ``taxgo.'' They have no \nproposal. You can't tax your way out of this problem.\n  In fact, we have the right tax policy in place because we are \ngenerating huge revenue. What you need to do is aggressively address \nthe spending side of the ledger. Therefore, I put forward a proposal \nwhich is supported by a large number--30 cosponsors--of my colleagues \non this side of the aisle which sets out eight different initiatives \ncalled ``SOS''--stop overspending--the purpose of which is to get our \nlong-term fiscal house in order. Even though the deficit is coming down \nprobably below even what would be a balanced budget for all intents and \npurposes if we weren't confronted with a war which we have to fight and \nthe Katrina situation which we are confronted with--in fact, if you \ntook the cost of the war out, which we have to spend because we are \nconfronted with a war on terror, which is for our survival, if we took \nthe cost of Katrina out, we would essentially have a balanced budget \nnext year. That is the fact.\n  But we also have to face the fact that in the outyears when the baby \nboom generation retires, that is not going to be the case. There will \nbe a huge amount of pressure on us because the cost of sustaining the \nretirement benefits is going to overwhelm the younger generation's \nability to pay for it. We have to put forward an aggressive program to \nresolve that issue, to make the cost of Government affordable for our \nchildren while still delivering quality services to those who retire.\n  We can do it if we think about it and start soon to address it. That \nis what SOS does. There are eight different proposals to try to \naccomplish that.\n\n[[Page S7295]]\n\n  I hope that we will take it up and at least aggressively debate it \nbecause it is an idea that basically uses the process to push policy, \nand the policy is what we need. We need to get on that case.\n  At this time, I yield the floor. I understand the Senator from \nLouisiana has an amendment to offer. We look forward to proceeding with \nthe amendment process relative to the homeland security matter.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4548\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter], for himself, Mr. \n     Nelson of Florida, and Mr. Coburn, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4548.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the United States Customs and Border Protection \n   from preventing an individual not in the business of importing a \n  prescription drug from importing an FDA-approved prescription drug)\n\n       On page 127, between line 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       Sec. 540. None of the funds made available in this Act for \n     United States Customs and Border Protection may be used to \n     prevent an individual not in the business of importing a \n     prescription drug (within the meaning of section 801(g) of \n     the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act) from importing a \n     prescription drug that complies with sections 501, 502, and \n     505 of such Act.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, the goal of this amendment is very \nstraightforward. It is about breaking down the artificial barrier that \nprevents many Americans, including many seniors, from obtaining safe, \nFDA-approved, and affordable prescription drugs.\n  It is no secret that Americans pay more for their medicine than any \nother citizen in the world, of any other industrialized country. Yet \nour country is the biggest marketplace for these drugs in the world. \nOur seniors are buying their medicine in Canada as a result of that and \nin some other countries simply because it is cheaper. There is no other \nreason. Yet we see an increasing ratcheting up by Customs and \nprotection agents in an effort to seize these personal legal medicines \nfrom Americans who are crossing from Canada back to the United States.\n  That is why I bring my amendment to the floor--to stop this idiocy \nand lunacy. My amendment is simple. Stop that escalating practice by \nthe Customs and Border Protection of seizing personally used, FDA-\napproved medicines from American citizens reentering the country. My \namendment would do this by simply prohibiting funds from being used for \nthis Customs and Border Protection activity.\n  Let me reiterate some very important things about this amendment.\n  First of all, it would do nothing more and nothing less than allow \nour own citizens who are reentering our own country to be able to \npossess FDA-approved prescription medicines for their own personal use \nwith a legitimate doctor's prescription.\n  That brings up a second very important point. When we talk about \nprescription drug imports, there are really two types that we often \ntalk about and deal with: commercial imports by wholesalers, huge \nquantities brought in for the purpose of resale in this country, and \npersonal imports by consumers.\n  My amendment is simply about personal imports by consumers. We are \nnot talking about huge quantities. We are not talking about resale \nwithin the United States.\n  Third, my amendment is limited to FDA-approved drugs. There is this \nerroneous notion that sometimes comes up in this reimportation debate \nthat somehow we are bypassing the entire FDA approval process, that \nsomehow we are throwing out the window that entire process by which the \nFDA approves certain drugs after rigorous testing and analysis. None of \nthat is true, particularly with regard to my amendment, because, again, \nmy amendment only applies to FDA-approved drugs.\n  Fourth and finally, my amendment only applies to citizens who have a \nvalid doctor's prescription to obtain these drugs. What could be \nsimpler and make more sense than simply allowing American citizens who \npossess these legal drugs that they obtain with a doctor's \nprescription, FDA-approved for their own personal use, not huge \nquantities, to allow them to possess these legal drugs as they reenter \ntheir own country, the United States of America?\n  This amendment would not legalize reimportation full-scale. It would \nnot legalize wholesale reimportation. It would not get into so many of \nthe more controversial aspects of the issue. It would simply say we are \nnot going to allow Customs and Border Patrol to ratchet up this \nactivity by taking away seniors' drugs as they come into our country.\n  I think it is very significant and noteworthy that this sort of \nreimportation measure has enormous support certainly in this country \nbut also in the Congress.\n  I want to point out some specific legislative history that \ndemonstrates this support.\n  Congress has shown support for this in numerous ways, including very \nrecently. First of all, my amendment was passed in the House. A nearly \nidentical version of the amendment was offered by Representative \nEmerson of Missouri. That amendment was attached to this very same \nappropriations bill in subcommittee, and it survived the entire process \ngoing through the committee process and the floor.\n  That amendment is identical to the amendment which I am presenting on \nthe Senate floor today. It passed through the entire House process with \nvery strong support.\n  There are other instances that show very strong bipartisan support \nfor this sort of measure. Recently, the House passed an Agriculture \nappropriations bill. There was also a significant reimportation \nprovision put on that bill and included on the bill in the committee \nprocess, at the committee stage of consideration of the bill. That \nunderlying bill, including that very important reimportation amendment, \nwas passed overwhelmingly in the full Chamber by the full House by a \nvote of 378 to 46. I thank my House colleagues, Representative Emerson \nand Representative Gutknecht and many others for their leadership in \nthis regard.\n  Finally, an entire freestanding bill has been passed through the \nHouse before on this issue, the Pharmaceutical Market Access Act. That \nwas in 2003, and by a vote of 243 to 186 after, I might add, the most \nintense lobbying in the House that I ever experienced because I was a \nMember of the House at that time--lobbying by the pharmaceutical \ncompanies against this bill. That freestanding bill passed the House by \na very significant vote, 243 to 186.\n  I note that bill was far broader than the personal reimportation \namendment which we have on the floor today. Again, it demonstrates the \nsignificant bipartisan support all of these reimportation measures \nhave, certainly in the country at large, including in the Congress.\n\n  Finally, I note another victory we had not too long ago with regard \nto trade language. There was the very worrisome practice up until \nrecently that the administration's U.S. Trade Representative would \nnegotiate into many bilateral trade deals language which effectively \nbarred reimportation from the other country--the trading partner. This \nwas very unfortunate because it was closing the door to reimportation \nbefore it even had been opened by the Congress through trade \nnegotiation.\n  Because of this very unfortunate practice, many of us in Congress, \nthe House and the Senate, went to the administration and expressed our \nconcern. Even more importantly, we brought language in the form of an \namendment and attached it to an appropriations bill. That language \nsaid: Stop doing this; you cannot do it; it is ridiculous to negotiate \nfree-trade agreement barriers to reimportation. We passed that language \ninto law. I worked with my Senate colleague from Michigan on that \nissue. Many like-minded House colleagues worked on it in the House. We \npassed that into law. Most recently, the administration has \nacknowledged they will end this practice once and for all of \nnegotiating this\n\n[[Page S7296]]\n\nantireimportation language in trade agreements.\n  There is enormous support for this type of measure in the country. \nThere is also significant bipartisan support for this in the Congress, \nas has been demonstrated many previous times.\n  In this discussion, we should focus on the individuals--particularly \nthe seniors--who are compelled to cross the border in many instances to \nget affordable prescription drugs. We should not focus on the wishes, \nthe pleas, and the intense lobbying by the drug companies. Seniors face \nenormous hurdles as they face their declining years with the escalating \ncosts of prescription drugs. We should not add this additional hurdle \nto the list, with Customs and Border Patrol agents forcibly seizing \nlegal, FDA-approved medicines procured with a doctor's prescription as \nseniors come back across the border.\n  Finally, in closing, as we think about this amendment, we should also \nconsider what the true priorities of the Customs and Border Patrol \nshould be. We are at war. It is a different type of war than we have \never faced before--a war on terror. That war has been brought to our \nown shores by very evil-focused people who came into this country \nillegally. We face new escalating threats, including potential threats \nfrom weapons of mass destruction. Our borders are a very important \nbattleground in that war on terror. Yet in this new post-September 11 \ncontext, we will devote significant resources, significant focus on \nstripping seniors of prescription drugs they have gotten with a \ndoctor's prescription, FDA-approved drugs, for their own personal use, \nwith no wholesalers and no resale. That is a ridiculous policy for the \nCustoms and Border Patrol to continue.\n  In the post-September 11 world, we should demand that Customs and \nBorder Patrol focus on the true priorities we face in the war on \nterror. Stripping these small amounts of prescription drugs from the \nhands of seniors, which are attained with a prescription, which are FDA \napproved, which are for personal use, which are not for resale, not for \nwholesale, not obtained by wholesalers, should not be a priority of the \nCustoms and Border Patrol.\n  In closing, let me again thank my colleague from Florida, Senator \nNelson, who will speak in a few minutes. Also, I thank the Senator from \nOklahoma, Mr. Coburn, for cosponsoring this amendment with me, and all \nof my colleagues who have worked on this issue, including many House \nMembers.\n  Each year, millions of Americans who cannot otherwise afford their \nprescription drugs go into Canada with a doctor's prescription, buy \nFDA-approved drugs, and take them back into our country. We should not \nsick the police, the Customs and Border Protection agents on them, \nparticularly in a post-September 11 world when that agency in \nparticular has far more important priorities.\n  I urge all of our colleagues in the Senate to support this simple, \nstraightforward amendment. It is the right thing to do on this issue. \nIt is the right thing to do with regard to setting the right priorities \nof Customs and Border Patrol.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. VITTER. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. To understand the amendment, would this amendment cover \npurchases over the Internet or purchases by mail order?\n  Mr. VITTER. It would cover any purchases which are subject to seizure \nby Customs and Border Patrol. I don't offhand know if those purchases \nare ordinarily subject to that seizure. I believe most of what we are \ntalking about is personal seizure at border checkpoints when \nindividuals are crossing back into the country, but the amendment would \ncover any potential seizure by Customs and Border Patrol.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will yield further, I think he may have \nanswered the question. As I understand it, it does cover Internet \npurchases and purchases by mail order. Customs has jurisdiction over \nthose should they come across the border.\n  Mr. VITTER. If they are subject to that seizure, yes, as I stated, \nthe amendment would cover that.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if the Senator will further yield, it would \nalso apply to purchases that could come from any country--we are not \njust talking about Canada? For example, purchases from England, they \ncould come from India, they could come from Cuba, they could come from \nLibya, they could come from even states that have been identified as \nterrorist states?\n  Mr. VITTER. In its present form, the amendment would cover any \ncountry. We have a change in the amendment we are submitting to the \ndesk to exclude a certain list of countries, including most of the \ncountries the Senator mentioned.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask further, would it exclude India?\n  Mr. VITTER. No, it would not.\n  Mr. GREGG. Would it exclude Pakistan?\n  Mr. VITTER. No, it would not.\n  Mr. GREGG. Would it exclude Brazil?\n  Mr. VITTER. No, it would not.\n  Mr. GREGG. If I could ask further, the FDA position, as I understand \nit, is that drugs which are unapproved for sale which come across the \nborder violate the FDA approval. The Senator, in his statement, \nreferred many times to ``FDA-approved drugs.'' As I understand the \nprocess today, the FDA views any drug purchased outside the United \nStates, distributed outside the United States, as being unapproved for \nsale and therefore not meeting FDA standards. Is that not a correct \nanalysis of the FDA view of how it views drugs that come into this \ncountry?\n  Mr. VITTER. I think it is an exactly correct analysis of the FDA view \nbased on the fact that the FDA, at least in this administration, is \ncompletely against reimportation, so they have defined FDA approval to \nspecifically exclude reimportation.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is correct. But if the Senator would yield further, \nthe Senator is making a point in his statement that these would be FDA-\napproved drugs the people are purchasing when, in fact, they are not \nFDA-approved drugs because no drug that is imported into the United \nStates, distributed outside the United States, can receive FDA approval \nunder their rules because the FDA decided they cannot certify the \nefficacy and safety of those drugs. Isn't that the FDA position today?\n  Mr. VITTER. The FDA position is exactly as the Senator says. They are \nagainst reimportation, so they have defined FDA approval on technical \ngrounds to exclude by definition anything that comes in from other \ncountries. The point of my remarks is that these are exactly the same \nas FDA-approved drugs.\n  Mr. GREGG. If I could inquire further, that is the essence of the \ndifference. The FDA does not deem them to be exactly the same because \nthe FDA cannot certify their efficacy and safety. That is why the FDA \nhas said that because they are not manufactured here, because they do \nnot have control over the manufacturing process, because they do not \nknow how they have been adulterated or may or may not have been \nadulterated or how they have been synthesized, they are not going to \napprove drugs coming into this country. So there is a significant \ndifference between what someone buys overseas and what someone buys in \nAmerica.\n  Mr. VITTER. If I could respond, in claiming my time, I disagree with \nthat wholeheartedly.\n  Yes, the FDA has refused to take any action to do that. Can they? \nAbsolutely, they can. Is it possible to do that, particularly in the \nmodern age of packaging technology? Absolutely.\n  Most of the drugs we are talking about, in fact, are manufactured \neither in this country or in the same manufacturing points as the drugs \nthat are bought in this country. So I disagree with the premise the \nSenator has laid out. But that is certainly the FDA's position, not to \nattempt to do any of that and to be completely, 1,000 percent opposed \nto reimportation.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. If I could ask the Senator a few more questions, then I am \nhappy to yield the floor.\n\n  Assuming your hypothetical is correct, that the FDA could reach \nbeyond our borders and could effectively review these drugs, which the \nFDA claims it cannot do, which is why they said they will not approve \nthis, your amendment says that Customs and Border Patrol shall not be \nable to stop these drugs from coming across the border.\n  Customs and Border Patrol does not have any control over the efficacy \nor\n\n[[Page S7297]]\n\nsafety of these drugs. This amendment should really be directed at the \nFDA because to put Customs and Border Patrol in this position means \nthey have to release drugs which the FDA today is saying it does not \napprove. Yet there is no process for having the FDA come in and be \nrequired to approve them under the Senator's amendment.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield so this Senator can get \nin on this conversation?\n  Mr. VITTER. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Florida, and I am \nhappy to respond to the other points at some future time.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. If I may, this is a matter which can easily be \nworked out. The questions the Senator from New Hampshire are raising \nare very legitimate questions. It is a matter that can easily be worked \nout if the administration is given some direction.\n  For example, approximately a year and a half, 2 years ago, the Acting \nDirector of the Food and Drug Administration, Mr. Crawford, made it \nclear to this Senator that the FDA was not going to object to private \nprescriptions for Americans coming from Canada for a limited supply--\nsuch as 90 days for personal use--which is the biggest part of the \nobjection the Senator from Louisiana and this Senator from Florida \nhave, that senior citizens are being prohibited from getting the great \ndiscounts they can get either by ordering them from the Internet, by \nmail, or personally going over to Canada.\n  If there were an intention to work out this problem, it could be done \nbetween all of these agencies that the Senator from New Hampshire is \nraising.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if I might renew my question, the Senator \nfrom Florida may not have been in the Senate when I asked, Does this \napply to Internet purchases, and the answer is yes; does it apply to \nmail order purchases, and the answer is yes; does it apply to countries \nsuch as India, Brazil, Pakistan, and the answer is yes. I understand \nthe Senator from Louisiana will modify the amendment to take off a list \nof countries that it would not apply to, terrorist nations such as \nSudan and I guess Cuba.\n  I renew my question because I am not sure the Senator from Florida \nwas dispositive on it, which is, Shouldn't this amendment be directed \nat the FDA because to direct it at Customs and Border Patrol means that \nCustoms and Border Patrol will be stopped from basically taking the \ndrug which comes into this country, which FDA has now declared it \ncannot certify the efficacy and safety of, taking that drug, sending it \nover to FDA, and having the FDA evaluate it? Customs and Border Patrol \nhas no expertise in evaluating efficacy and safety of drugs. For all we \nknow, the drug that is being ordered over the Internet under the \nSenator's amendment could be anything. It could be claimed to be \nLipitor, but it could be rat poisoning. In fact, recent anecdotal \nstudies have shown something like 80 percent of the drugs coming in \nthrough the Internet do not meet the standards they claim they do meet.\n\n  So why would you amend this bill to put Customs and Border Protection \nin the untenable position of having to basically release drugs to come \ninto this country, which the FDA says it cannot claim are safe, when \nyou have not put in the higher regime requirements of having the FDA \ncome in and determine whether those drugs are safe?\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I would respond to the chairman by saying \nthat amendment after amendment after amendment has been directed at the \nFDA to do the right thing and create a sensible regime with regard to \nthis issue, and the FDA is flatout opposed to this and has made no \neffort in that regard, even though there is clearly the technical \ncapability to do that through packaging technology and the like. So \nthis is an effort to make the entire administration--all aspects that \nneed to be involved--do the right thing.\n  But to say we have not asked the FDA to do this is ludicrous. We have \nbeen trying to drag them--kicking and screaming--to do the right thing \nfor several years now. In fact, while they hide behind these safety \narguments, I am afraid they are allowing safety issues to go by \nunaddressed.\n  In fact, this practice is common. Whether this amendment goes on this \nbill, whether this activity of Customs and Border Protection continues, \none thing is certain: Seniors will import, for personal use, \nprescription drugs from Canada and elsewhere. That will go on, to a \nvery significant extent.\n  Even if this amendment does not pass, Customs and Border Protection \nwill never round up all of those drugs. This is a common and a growing \npractice because of the price issue.\n  So the question is: When is the FDA going to wake up and truly \naddress these concerns that the chairman brings up with some sensible \nregime? This amendment is designed to force them in that direction.\n  But to suggest we have not asked them to do this, that we are going \nto the wrong agency, is a little silly because we have been asking them \nto do this for several years now. And we renew that request now.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will yield for one last question, and then, \nobviously, the Senator from Florida wants to be heard on the subject. \nBut it is not silly because basically the fact pattern that is going to \nbe created--were this amendment adopted and if it became law, without \nany directive to the FDA they have to step forward and actually \nevaluate these drugs to see if they meet safety and efficacy \nstandards--the practical effect of this amendment would be that Customs \nand Border Protection could not stop any drugs coming into this country \nfrom other countries. That would include countries such as Pakistan and \nIndia and other countries which have some serious issues as to the \nefficacy and safety of those drugs.\n  In fact, if I were a creative terrorist, I would say to myself: Hey, \nlisten, all I have to do is produce a can here that says ``Lipitor'' on \nit, make it look like the original Lipitor bottle--which is not too \nhard to do--fill it with anthrax and have a bunch of people from the \nUnited States order it who might be affiliated with me and import it \nthat way into this country--or anything else they want to use in a \nbiological way.\n  Here we are telling Customs and Border Protection that their job is \nto ratchet down on the capacity of terrorists to use entry ports into \nthis country. And what you are saying in this amendment is: You, \nCustoms and Border Protection, are not going to be allowed to evaluate \nanything that comes into this country which has a seal which makes it \nlook like it is an FDA-type of drug. And the FDA will not have reviewed \nit. So nobody will have reviewed it.\n  So I think what you are creating--in your attempt to push FDA into \ndoing something you feel they are not doing that they should do, you \nhave targeted the wrong agency, and you are actually creating a massive \nhole in our capacity to secure or borders and protect ourselves.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, reclaiming my time, let me respond to the \nchairman's remarks with two comments. First of all, the FDA--right now, \ntoday, this hour, as we speak--has all the authority it needs to take \nany of the actions the chairman has described. It does not need any \nadditional directive or authority. It has that authority. So the \nsuggestion that somehow we need to act toward the FDA to give it that \nauthority before it can move is absolutely not the case. In fact, we \nhave been trying to get the FDA to act in this regard for several years \nbecause there are legitimate safety issues that should be met.\n  Secondly, I compliment the chairman for trying to figure out a \nscenario in which this is a true top priority of Customs and Border \nProtection in a post 9/11 world. I just do not think it adds up, \nthough. I do not think, with all the border security and terrorist \nthreats we face as a nation, allowing the Customs and Border Protection \nagents to continue--to even escalate--their practice of taking away \nsmall amounts of prescription drugs from seniors crossing back from \nCanada, et cetera, is the right thing to do, is a right priority for \nCustoms and Border Protection.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield back my time and look forward to \nthe comments from my amendment cosponsor, the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, here is an example. If we want \nto\n\n[[Page S7298]]\n\nsolve this problem, the different agencies of the Government can come \ntogether and solve this problem. We already have it on the record, in \ncorrespondence and telephone conversation between this Senator from \nFlorida and the FDA, that they have no objection to an up-to-90-day \nsupply coming from Canada, ordered by American citizens, either by the \nInternet, by mail, or by personally going to Canada.\n  And what about the safety the Senator from New Hampshire has raised? \nSafety: It is coming from the same drug manufacturers we presently have \nin America; the very same drug, very same packaging, very same \npharmaceutical laboratories. The big difference is our citizens--and \nparticularly this applies to our senior citizens--can get these \nprescription drugs at a much lower price.\n  Now, I would encourage the Senator from Louisiana, in order to avoid \nthe attacks on the amendment, as have been raised by the Senator from \nNew Hampshire, to pare down the amendment so that those attacks cannot \napply.\n  The safety issue of prescription drugs coming from Canada cannot be \nassailed because those drugs come from the very same manufacturers, in \nthe very same places, as those prescription drugs that are, in fact, \nprovided to our American citizens.\n  Mr. VITTER. Will the Senator yield on that?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Of course.\n  Mr. VITTER. I appreciate the suggestion. In fact, we have been \ntalking to the chairman's staff about additional language, which we \nwould ask be added to the amendment by unanimous consent, to create a \nlist of countries to which this cannot apply and would specifically ask \nthe chairman's staff for the appropriate list of countries for us to \nconsider, a list from their point of view.\n  So we will be happy to work on that and wrap this up before we end \nthis floor debate.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator.\n  Upon further examination, with the Senator's staff, I think they will \nfind that in most cases we are talking about citizens from Louisiana, \nas well as citizens from Florida and any other State, who are ordering \nthese prescription drugs at hugely discounted prices from Canada. So \nthat is the major source. That clearly is the interest of this Senator, \nas we are looking out for our citizens.\n  Now, what, in fact, is happening--and this Senator sees it in great \nabundance because it is no secret the State of Florida has a \nconsiderably larger percentage of senior citizens than most States. We \nlike to call it the land called paradise. It is where a lot of people \ncome to retire. Naturally, in their retirement years, they are looking \nat trying to make ends meet and their budget work.\n  They thought they were going to get a considerable break on their \nprescription drugs under the Medicare prescription drug plan. And now a \nlot of senior citizens are suddenly finding out the drugs are costing \nthem more than they thought they were. And those who are hitting the \nso-called doughnut hole--that part, once they and the Government have \nexpended $2,250 on drugs in any one calendar year--there is no \nreimbursement from Medicare all the way up to $5,100.\n  So our senior citizens are additionally having this concern that they \ncannot afford the drugs. Therefore, if they want to turn to another \nsource, where they can get prescription drugs considerably discounted, \nthen why should the Government policy not be to allow them to do that? \nThat is the essence of the intent of this amendment.\n  The Senator from Louisiana has heard from his constituents, as has \nthis Senator. Over the last several months, our offices in Florida have \nreceived numerous calls from people who say the cheaper prescription \ndrugs they bought from Canada have simply vanished in shipment.\n  For example, Mrs. Jacqueline Flick--she is from Coral Gables--relies \non Lipitor to help lower her risk of heart disease. She is living on a \nmoderate income. She cannot afford to pay the full price that she would \npay at a Walgreens or a CVS. She can get it from Canada and has been. \nShe and her husband have been getting Lipitor for years by ordering it \nover the Internet from Canada, and she gets it at less than half the \nprice.\n  Naturally, she was outraged last month when she got a letter from \nCustoms and Border Protection notifying her that they had confiscated \nher Lipitor. By the way, that letter stated reasons that had nothing to \ndo with her particular case.\n  I will give you another example. Alex Zeligson is from my home county \nof Brevard. He is from Palm Bay. He is a patient with emphysema. He \nrequires oxygen. He requires 13 different medications every day, \nincluding medication for his heart. A bunch of his prescription drugs \nfrom Canada were seized in February.\n  Naturally, with this going on--and that is just two of many examples. \nAnd it has not just happened in the last few months. This has been \ngoing on in the State of Florida for the last year and a half. \nNaturally, these folks are upset.\n  Over the years, the Government has permitted personal supplies of \nprescription drugs to be imported from Canada. But without adequately \ninforming the Congress, Customs and Border Protection, last November, \nimplemented a new and stricter policy on personal prescription drug \nimportation.\n  Last November, this new policy, without informing the Congress, was \nquietly implemented, until hundreds of complaints from constituents \nacross the country, press reports, and actions by various congressional \noffices uncovered this shift in policy.\n  I can tell you that 900 prescription drugs were intercepted in the \ncity of Miami alone. The reason behind this shift remains unknown, but \naccording to documents filed in a court case in Minnesota, there has \nbeen illegal and collusive activity to block the imports of cheaper \nprescription drugs from Canada. Our office has discovered that this new \npolicy resulted in tens of thousands of prescription drug shipments \nbeing detained by Customs officials. Customs has admitted to 25,000 \nprescription drug shipments intercepted; 900 of those were in Miami \nalone.\n  Silently implementing a stricter policy without adequately informing \nthe public puts the health of those who have relied on the prompt \ndelivery of prescription drugs at risk. In response to these stepped-up \nseizures, this Senator from Florida requested the Department of \nHomeland Security Inspector General to investigate the change in \npolicy. The Inspector General rejected my request. I have asked the \nSenate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to \ninvestigate.\n  Meanwhile, Americans who rely on low-cost prescription drugs from \nCanada in order to avoid having to make a choice between prescriptions \nand food are kept waiting. That is why I have joined the Senator from \nLouisiana in this amendment. I hope he can perfect the amendment so \nthat it meets the objections the Senator from New Hampshire raised. The \nintent is simply to prohibit Customs from utilizing funds to stop the \nimportation of FDA-approved prescription drugs by American citizens. A \nsimilar provision has already passed the House in the Homeland Security \nappropriations bill. This amendment, as perfected, is going to ensure \nthat Americans, especially the frail elderly or those with debilitating \nconditions, are going to be able to at least have a chance of affording \nthe medications they need. It is also going to send a clear message to \nCustoms to explain their dramatic change in policy last November. I \nhope we will get consensus on this, stop fighting this bureaucratic \ngame, and get some relief for our citizens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I come to support the amendment, \nrecognizing that it is not perfect, but recognizing that it has been \noffered only because another piece of legislation, which is more \ncomprehensive, dealing only with FDA-approved drugs, bipartisan, a \nbroader group of Senators supporting it, has been blocked consistently. \nSenator Vitter offers this because it is the only way to get this \nsubject to the floor of the Senate.\n  It is pretty unbelievable to hear the spirited defense of the \npharmaceutical industry. After we passed a prescription drug benefit in \nthe Medicare bill in the first quarter of this year, the pharmaceutical \nindustry increased the cost of brand-name drugs triple the rate of \ninflation.\n\n[[Page S7299]]\n\n  I have been before committees on this subject. Senator Snowe and I \nappeared before our committee. There was a spirited defense of the \npharmaceutical industry there. This is an industry that has some of the \nhighest profits in the world. They produce miracle, lifesaving drugs, \nyes, but they also produce something else. They produce a pricing \npattern that says the American people should pay the highest price in \nthe world for prescription drugs. It is unfair.\n  The issue is, can American citizens import FDA-approved prescription \ndrugs, some of them made in this country and then sent to Canada or \nsent to some other country, can U.S. citizens have access to those \ndrugs, drugs that are safe? The only difference between those drugs and \nthe drugs sold here under the same name is those drugs are priced at a \nmuch less expensive price.\n  I ask unanimous consent to show two pill bottles. This is the issue. \nThis is Lipitor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The same pill, put in the same bottle, made by the same \ncompany. One is marketed in the United States; one is sent to Canada. \nWhat is the difference? The difference is, the U.S. consumer is told to \npay 65 percent more for the same medicine. The same pill made by the \nsame company, FDA approved, sent two places, to U.S. consumers and to \nCanadian consumers, and the U.S. consumers are told, you pay 65 percent \nmore. Why? Because the drug industry says so.\n  Myself, Senator Vitter, and others propose that you ought to be able \nto access those lower priced, FDA-approved drugs from Canada. The \npharmaceutical industry doesn't like that. I understand. I understand \nwhy they want to maximize profits. The fact is, they say: If you do \nthat and in any way diminish our profits, we will reduce the amount of \nresearch we do on new drugs. Isn't it interesting that they spend more \non marketing and promotion than they do on research? Maybe they could \ncut back a little bit on that advertising on television that says: Ask \nyour doctor whether the purple pill is right for you. I don't have the \nfoggiest idea what the purple pill does, but every time I am shaving in \nthe morning I see the commercial: Ask your doctor whether the purple \npill is right for you. Maybe we could cut back the bid on that \nadvertising.\n  We have had commitments to bring this issue to the floor of the \nSenate. It was midnight when I believed the majority leader gave me a \ncommitment to bring our comprehensive bill to the Senate. We put a \nprovision in the Senate Record. The majority leader says he didn't make \na commitment. That is not what the words say. I went to a small school, \na class of nine in a small town. All of us should be able to read words \nand understand what they mean. I believed the majority leader. In \nexchange for my releasing a hold on a nominee, the majority leader made \na commitment to bring prescription drug reimportation to the floor of \nthe Senate. He says he didn't.\n\n  The fact is, the administration and the majority in the Congress have \nblocked this. When I say we have a bipartisan bill, I come today to \nsupport a piece of legislation offered by Senator Vitter. That is \nbipartisan. But there are people who have determined they will block \nlegislation that deals with the reimportation of prescription drugs. \nThat is why this is offered to an appropriations bill which is a \nfunding limitation. It is perfectly appropriate to offer this to an \nappropriations bill.\n  My colleague asked Senator Vitter a wide range of questions. My \ncolleague has been opposed to reimportation of prescription drugs. He \ngives as spirited a defense of the pharmaceutical industry as anybody I \nhave heard. I believe we ought to give a spirited defense on behalf of \nthe consumers. Why should American consumers pay double, triple, nine \ntimes as much for prescription drugs?\n  I had a guy sitting on a hay bale at a farmstead meeting we had. He \nwas in his 80s. He said: My wife has been fighting breast cancer for 3 \nyears. We have been driving back and forth to Canada to buy Tamoxifen. \nThat is a medicine he could purchase in Canada for 80 percent less than \nit costs in the United States. He lived in North Dakota, so they could \ndrive to Canada and bring it back because Immigration has traditionally \nallowed a limited amount for personal use to come back across the \nborder. But now the FDA, and under Dr. McClellan some years ago and \nunder Dr. Crawford and others, has made it their mission to describe \nthat somehow there is a terrorist threat or there is a contamination of \nprescription drugs. These are FDA-approved drugs, many of them made in \nthis country and then shipped outside. And the American people are \ntold: You can't have access to them because they are cheaper than the \ndrugs you have to purchase in the drugstore in the United States. That \nmakes no sense.\n  I am wondering when there will be a critical mass in the Senate to \nstand up and give a spirited defense of the American consumer. When \nwill that happen? Not soon, I am afraid. That is unfortunate. Perhaps \nwe can ask once again whether we will get a commitment to bring a bill \nto the floor of the Senate that is bipartisan, that has broad \nsponsorship. The legislation that I and many others have introduced is \nlegislation that will allow, under a broader range of circumstances, \nthe reimportation of prescription drugs and do so without any safety \nissues. Perhaps the amendment offered today will stimulate and require \nthat agreement.\n  No one wants to, in any way, diminish the safety of our prescription \ndrugs. There is nothing in the reimportation of FDA-approved drugs that \nwould, in any way, cause someone to legitimately claim there is a \nsafety issue. That is a specious issue. There is no safety involved \nhere. This is about pricing. It is about whether the American people \nwill continue to be stuck by being charged the highest prices in the \nworld for prescription drugs. Miracle drugs offer no miracles to those \nwho cannot afford them. All of us have heard the stories. I have heard \nplenty of people going to the grocery store who decide that first they \nhave to go to the pharmaceutical counter to figure out what their \nprescription drugs are going to cost before they can decide how much \nthey can buy in groceries. We have all heard those stories.\n  This country has a lot of senior citizens. We are a country of people \nliving longer. That is wonderful. In one sense, we have increased the \nlifespan by 30 years. Life expectancy has increased by 30 years this \ncentury. That means we have more older people. Senior citizens are \nroughly 12 percent of the population and consume one-third of all the \nprescription drugs, and they are the least likely to be able to afford \nthem. We have them walking into pharmacies now paying the highest \nprices in the world. It is not the fault of the local pharmacist. This \nis the pricing practice of the pharmaceutical industry.\n  They get all upset when people would tarnish their industry. I am not \ndoing that. Good for them. They produce lifesaving drugs, a fair amount \nof it with research paid for by the American taxpayer at the National \nInstitutes of Health. We have every right to be tarnishing the pricing \npolicy of an industry that says they are going to charge the highest \nprices in the world to the American consumer.\n  My colleague from Louisiana talks about reimportation with his \namendment. Let me talk about what they do in Europe. In Europe they \nhave something called parallel trading. We have actually Europeans \ntestify on that. If you are in France and want to buy a prescription \ndrug from Spain, that is not a problem. They have parallel trading. If \nyou are in Germany and want to buy a prescription drug from Italy, that \nis not a problem. They have run that for a couple of decades, and there \nare not any safety issues involved. This spirited defense of the \npharmaceutical industry, by raising this specious, nonsense issue of \nsafety, is almost unbelievable. It is a Trojan horse for those who want \nto keep prices high for the American consumer.\n  Let's have a real debate on the floor, not with a funding limitation. \nI will support this because it is probably the only way to pry the lid \noff this issue. But let's have a real debate with the larger bill that \nwe thought had been promised to be debated. Let's decide to stop \nblocking the ability of the American people to access FDA-approved \ndrugs at lower prices. Let's have the market system work. If the market \nsystem works for the big interests, what about the little interests? \nWhat about the little guy?\n  Bob Wills of the Texas Playboys back in the 1930s had a line that \napplies to\n\n[[Page S7300]]\n\nmuch of what goes on around here: The little bee sucks the blossom and \nthe big bee gets the honey. The little guy plucks the cotton and the \nbig guy gets the money. Isn't that always the way it goes? And doesn't \nthat apply to this issue of charging the highest prices in the world \nfor prescription drugs to the American people?\n  It is wrong. Everybody in here ought to understand it is wrong. We \nought to begin to pry the lid off this issue and fix it. My colleague \nfrom Louisiana has offered an amendment. It would not be my first \nchoice, but I will support it. He has offered it, I assume, because it \nis the only way to get into this issue--this issue being reimportation \nof prescription drugs--by using a funding limitation to get there. He \ncan do that without requiring 60 votes on this bill.\n\n  That is the purpose, I assume, of my colleagues from Louisiana and \nFlorida offering this amendment. I think they, too, would probably \nprefer that we would get an agreement from the majority leader to \nschedule a time for debate on a larger bill, but that has not been the \ncase. As a result, we will consider this issue and debate this issue \nnow for some while.\n  I will at some point during the deliberations on this appropriations \nbill ask by unanimous consent that we bring up S. 334 before the August \nrecess and debate that bill. In the meantime, I will be here to offer \nsupport to those who are trying to pry the lid off this issue by \noffering a funding limitation bill, and between coming over to the \nfloor of the Senate, I will watch the proceedings of the Senate on a \ntelevision set and be entertained by the spirited defense of the \npharmaceutical industry by some of my colleagues offering excuses for \nsupporting the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs being \ncharged to the American people, a position that is highly \nunsupportable, in my judgment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Senator from North Dakota raised a few \nissues, some of which are actually subject to rule XIX. I did not make \nthe point, but I probably should have.\n  The fact that under this regime one would be able to set up a process \nwhere people could ship drugs into this country which would not be \nreviewed by the FDA and would not be stopped by Customs and Border \nPatrol is not an issue of defending the drug industry. It is an issue \nof making sure that the person who gets that drug is actually getting \nwhat they paid for, is getting something that is safe, and that this \nprocess has not blown a gaping hole in our capacity to develop adequate \nsecurity for people who might want to ship into this country biological \nagents which could kill thousands of Americans.\n  This amendment, as it was originally offered--and I just asked \nreasonable questions. I didn't make allegations of purpose, as was the \nrepresentation of the Senator from North Dakota. This amendment, as it \nwas originally offered, would have allowed drugs to come into this \ncountry through the Internet which would not have been reviewed by the \nFDA. We wouldn't know where they were manufactured, whether the label \nthat claimed it was one drug was accurate to what was in them. It would \nhave simply said that Customs and Border Patrol could not stop those \ndrugs from coming into this country.\n  It is pretty obvious that under this amendment as it was originally \ndrafted, there were serious health risks for the people who were \nreceiving those drugs. FDA wasn't going to review them, and Customs and \nBorder Patrol was not going to be able to stop them. Think about that. \nA drug produced in some kitchen in Indonesia could be put in a bottle \nthat was made to look like an American product, purchased over the \nInternet on an alleged Canadian site, and shipped into the United \nStates, and the person who got those drugs would take them. There was a \nlot of anecdotal evidence when we had this bill before our committee \nthat said most of the drugs that were coming in over the Internet were \nnot as represented and some of them were actually poison.\n  In addition, of course, there is the very serious concern of national \nsecurity. Maybe the Senator from North Dakota doesn't believe it is a \nconcern. Maybe he only thinks big drug companies are the people who are \nbeing protected when the FDA determines whether a bottle of Lipitor is \nreally Lipitor coming from Pakistan or Afghanistan. I don't. I happen \nto think the people who are being protected when that bottle comes into \nthis country are the people who are getting it and the public at large \nif it has an agent in it which would basically kill people.\n  There is no question at all but that if I were a creative terrorist--\nI wouldn't even have to be all that creative--I could fill hundreds, \nthousands of alleged prescriptions with anthrax, ship them to my \ncohorts in the United States, and then let my cohorts do with that \nanthrax as they wished, or other agents which would be even more \nviolent and more communicable.\n  There is a reason why we have the safest drug delivery system in the \nworld, why people, when they go into the local drugstore, have absolute \nconfidence that what they are buying is what is on that label. It is \nbecause we have the FDA policing the industry and making sure that as \nit is manufactured, labeled, and delivered, it is what it says it is. \nThis amendment, as it was originally offered, did not accomplish that. \nFor the Senator from North Dakota to come down here and allege people \nwho might oppose it do so because they simply wish to carry the water \nof big drug companies is a discredit to those of us who are trying to \naddress the issue of safety for the American people, not only on \nspecific drugs that are delivered to them but as this bill is supposed \nto do on our homeland security.\n\n  So let's move on to the specifics. I understand the Senator from \nLouisiana has a modification to the amendment that is going to \nbasically limit it to Canada, and it is going to make sure it is \nstructured in a way that conforms with the Cosmetic Act. I congratulate \nhim for that modification. I appreciate him being responsive on that \npoint. It will dramatically improve this amendment.\n  There is still the issue out there that has to be addressed of, if \nCustoms and Border Patrol is charged with not looking at this stuff \nwhich is going to come in from Canada, who is going to look at it?\n  I have a bill which actually accomplishes this, by the way. It says \nFDA will have the authority to go into these foreign countries--and if \nyou limit it to Canada, it will be very manageable--and will have the \nmoney and resources--it is more a resource issue, the Senator from \nLouisiana is correct. It is not really an authority issue. What they \nneed is money to review the distribution process.\n  Under my bill, what would happen is a Web site would have to have \nFDA-certifiable approval. In other words, if you went to a site from \nwhich you can allegedly buy Canadian drugs, FDA would have reviewed \nthat Web site, reviewed the people who are selling through that Web \nsite, reviewed the product coming through that Web site, and the Web \nsite would receive something like a Good Housekeeping seal on it which \ncouldn't be forged and which would basically be monitored, so that when \nyou were buying off a Web site from Canada or directly from Canada by \nmail order or going into a Canadian pharmacy, you would know that the \nproduct was what it said it was and FDA had actually reviewed it.\n  That is a very doable event. It takes a regime. It takes money. All \nthat is actually going to have to be grafted on top of this amendment \nto make the amendment work. It is too complex to do at this level. \nHowever, if the Senator from Louisiana is going to modify his \namendment, my representation would be that when we get to conference we \nwill not take the amendment or, alternatively--which would be my \ndruthers--put this modification on top of it which is the language I \ndeveloped relative to giving FDA the regime authority and the financial \nauthority to monitor Canadian-delivered drugs.\n  I understand the Senator may move in that direction. If he does move \nin that direction, I congratulate him and thank him for making such a \nconstructive change in his amendment. I appreciate it. We will proceed \nfrom there.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n[[Page S7301]]\n\n                    Amendment No. 4548, as Modified\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, at this point I would like to revise my \namendment with the language which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right to modify his \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4548), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 127, between line 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       Sec. 540. None of the funds made available in this Act for \n     United States Customs and Border Protection may be used to \n     prevent an individual not in the business of importing a \n     prescription drug (within the meaning of section 801(g) of \n     the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act) from importing a \n     prescription drug from Canada that complies with the Food, \n     Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, as modified, as the subcommittee chairman \nindicated, this will limit the effect of the amendment to transactions \ninvolving Canada only.\n  Having done that, let me close with a few remarks. First, I \nappreciate the offer and the commitment of the Senator from New \nHampshire to work on this issue because, in fact, if he truly has these \nsafety concerns he was outlining--I tend to think the nature of some of \nthese scenarios he outlined were overly dramatic and not very well \ngrounded in reality, but if he thinks these scenarios are accurate, \nthen we need to act. The FDA needs to act today because even if my \namendment is defeated--and I am very hopeful it will not be; I am very \nhopeful it will get a resounding vote on the Senate floor--even if it \nis defeated, these transactions are going on every day in the \nthousands.\n  The Senator knows that Customs and Border Patrol will never stop all \nof these personal-use medicines from coming into the country. So this \nis going on every day, thousands upon thousands of cases a day. \nTherefore, if there are safety issues involved--and there are some--the \nFDA needs to act now and we need to act now to put a regime in place.\n  Unfortunately, many of us, including myself, including the Senator \nfrom North Dakota and others, have tried over and over and have been \nblocked procedurally from moving that type of legislation to the Senate \nfloor. That, as the Senator from North Dakota indicated, is what \nprovoked this amendment. But I welcome the offer and the commitment of \nthe Senator from New Hampshire to work in conference to put a full-\nblown regime together with regard to reimportation, and I welcome us \nbringing, either through this vehicle or through a stand-alone measure, \nthis important debate to the Senate floor.\n  There are some safety issues, but those issues exist even if my \namendment is defeated. Those issues exist because those transactions \nare going on every day, and they are growing in number because of the \nhuge price disparity between the cost of drugs in the United States and \nthe cost of those same FDA-approved equivalent drugs in places such as \nCanada.\n  Defeat of this amendment will not take care of those issues. The only \nthing that will take care of those issues is action, long overdue \naction by the FDA--and they have the authority now--or action by us in \nthe Congress to put together an entire reimportation regime. I look \nforward to doing that. It is long overdue. It is important because of \nthe very safety issues the Senator from New Hampshire outlines. It is \nalso important because of the tremendous price pressure our \nconstituents are under because we, unfortunately, labor under the \nhighest prescription drug prices in the world, even though we offer the \nmanufacturers the largest marketplace for those very same drugs in the \nworld.\n  I yield back my time and look forward to the adoption of this \namendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. VITTER. Absolutely.\n  Mr. GREGG. We are checking with the Democratic side, but if the \nSenator is agreeable, the Senator from North Dakota is going to speak \nfor half an hour, and at the conclusion of his speech, I suggest we go \nto a vote, if the Senator from Louisiana wishes to have a recorded \nvote, or we can accept the amendment.\n  Mr. VITTER. I do wish to have a recorded vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support the Vitter amendment to stop \nthe Customs and Border Protection agency from using its funds to block \nthe personal importation of prescription drugs from Canada that comply \nwith requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. We all \nknow that drugs distributed in Canada are as safe and effective as \ndrugs distributed in the United States.\n  Each of us has constituents who obtain prescription drugs from \nCanada. The reason is obvious. They are tired of being gouged by \nexorbitant U.S. prices for their medicines, when the identical drugs \nare available in Canada at half the price and are just as safe. Drugs \nfrom Canada are certainly a better choice for hard-pressed patients \nthan cutting their U.S. pills in half or taking them every other day to \nmake them more affordable or not taking needed drugs at all.\n  Innovative senior citizens first alerted the Nation several years ago \nto the opportunity available in Canada by organizing bus trips across \nthe border from many of our Northern States.\n  In Massachusetts, the city of Springfield began using Canadian \npharmacies to provide drugs for its city employees and retirees. \nSpringfield's example led the way for other city and State governments \nacross the country to do the same. The Internet revolution vastly \nexpanded the opportunity by enabling patients across America to go to \nCanada on the internet and save thousands of dollars a year on their \nprescriptions.\n  The administration should not be using the Customs agency to block \npatients from getting safe drugs from Canada. Yet recently it has been \nusing the Customs agency to avoid a current requirement that the Food \nand Drug Administration give special notice to a patient if it detains \nthe patient's imported drug at the border. This amendment should stop \nthat abuse, but this amendment is not the real answer on importation. \nIt is time for Congress to allow safe imports from Canada--and from \nother developed countries, too.\n  S. 334, the Dorgan-Snowe drug importation bill, will do this, and the \nSenate needs to act on this bill. Patients will be able to import drugs \nfrom exporters in Canada who are registered with FDA and regularly \ninspected by FDA. Wholesalers and pharmacies will be able to import \ndrugs from other developed countries if they register with FDA and \nagree to regular inspections by FDA. The imported drugs will fully meet \nFDA standards for approval and will have FDA-approved labeling.\n  S. 334 also prevents drug companies from blocking imports, as several \nmajor drug companies have been doing to shut down the rising tide from \nCanada.\n  The high price Americans pay today for prescription drugs is \nunacceptable and unfair. The bipartisan Dorgan-Snowe importation bill \nis a practical solution to bring drug prices down for patients at no \nrisk to the safety of our drug supply. That is the measure we should \nhave voted on today, but our Republican leadership keeps denying us a \ndebate and a vote on that needed bill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wanted to take a moment to note my \nvote for the amendment offered to H.R. 5441 by Senator Vitter. Senator \nVitter's amendment would prohibit the U.S. Customs and Border \nProtection from using funds to prevent individuals from importing a \nprescription drug from Canada that complies with the Federal Food, \nDrug, and Cosmetic Act, FDCA.\n  The strong support demonstrated today for Senator Vitter's amendment \nreemphasizes the importance of the issue of allowing Americans to \nimport prescription drugs.\n  I have long advocated allowing American consumers access to safe \ndrugs from other countries. In 2000, 2002 and 2003 I supported \namendments permitting reimportation of prescription drugs from Canada. \nIn 2004, Senator Kennedy and I offered bipartisan legislation to \nauthorize reimportation. And, last year, I introduced a reimportation \nbill with Senators Snowe, Kennedy, Dorgan and others. Our bill, S. 334, \nthe Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act, permits the \nimportation of prescription drugs and includes very important \nsafeguards to help ensure that those drugs are safe and obtained from \nlegitimate pharmacies. I look forward to continuing to pursue Senate \npassage of our comprehensive,\n\n[[Page S7302]]\n\nbipartisan bill. Allowing importation will increase competition and \nkeep the domestic pharmaceutical industry more responsive to consumers.\n  Senate approval of the Vitter amendment represents another \ndevelopment in an ongoing effort to help reduce the cost of life-saving \ndrugs for American consumers. We need to do more to foster competition \nby allowing imported medicine and to make sure that those prescription \ndrugs are safe. S.334 should be the next step on this issue.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I would like to explain my opposition to amendment No. \n4548 to the fiscal year 2007 Homeland Security appropriations bill. \nThis amendment would prohibit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection \nfrom preventing an individual not in the business of importing \nprescription drugs from importing an FDA-approved prescription drug. I \noppose allowing uninspected pharmaceuticals to be imported into the \ncountry.\n  I understand some prescription drugs are expensive, and many \nAmericans struggle to afford their medications. That is why Congress \npassed a bill in 2003 to create a prescription drug benefit in \nMedicare. The drug program has greatly reduced the amount seniors spend \non prescription drugs. This Medicare prescription drug bill also \nincludes several provisions aimed at reducing the cost of \npharmaceuticals, specifically by getting generic drugs to the market \nfaster. These are important changes aimed at reducing costs for \neveryone.\n  I have concerns about the safety of bringing prescription drugs into \nthe United States from other countries without meeting the safety \ncriteria currently in law. Under the current system, Americans can feel \nsecure when they purchase pharmaceuticals in this country. They know \nthe pills they are taking are safe and effective and that they have \nbeen approved by the Food and Drug Administration, which uses some of \nthe highest approval standards in the world. Congress should not put \nthe safety of our pharmaceutical supply in the hands of a foreign \ngovernment which may not recognize counterfeit or expired medicines or \nmay not have the same safety standards that we do. The last thing we \nwant to do is to undermine the integrity of our drug supply.\n  In fact, in December of 2005, a Food and Drug Administration \noperation found that nearly half of the imported drugs FDA intercepted \nfrom four selected countries were shipped to fill orders that consumers \nbelieved they were placing with ``Canadian'' pharmacies. Of the drugs \nbeing promoted as ``Canadian,'' based on accompanying documentation, 85 \npercent actually came from 27 countries around the globe. A number of \nthese products also were found to be counterfeit.\n  I believe this amendment will put our Nation's drug supply at risk \nand it is not even necessary. As this year goes on, more and more \nseniors are getting excellent and affordable coverage under the new \nprescription drug plan that we passed in 2003, which means allowing \npotentially unsafe drugs into our country is an unnecessary risk that \nwe do not need to take.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom North Dakota be recognized for half an hour, that no amendments be \noffered during his term of speaking and that at the conclusion of his \nspeaking, 2 minutes be equally divided on the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Louisiana, that we proceed to a rollcall vote, that the yeas and \nnays be deemed as ordered, and no second-degree amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Midsession Budget Review\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to thank the managers of the bill \nfor this time allocation. I appreciate it very much. I thank the \nchairman and the ranking member.\n  Today is the day of the so-called midsession review in which the \nadministration takes a middle-of-the-year look at our budget \ncircumstances. The President has already held a press conference in the \nWhite House, the Budget Director is speaking to the National Press \nClub, and they are heralding the improvement in the deficit outlook as \nproof that their fiscal plan is working. That is an interesting spin. \nThat is an interesting way of looking at these facts.\n  Let me give you what I consider to be the other side of the story, or \nperhaps it is better described as the rest of the story. The President \nis saying there has been a $100 billion improvement in the deficit \noutlook. Well, not really because that is based on his earlier \nprojection that many of us said, at the time, overestimated what the \ndeficit would be, for the very purpose of later this year, when the \ndeficit wasn't that big, to claim great success. That is exactly how \nthings have played out. But if you compare the new deficit projection \nwith what the actual deficit was last year, instead of getting into the \nprojection game, the actual deficit last year was $318 billion. Now \nthey are saying the deficit this year will be $296 billion.\n  Is this cause for some great celebration? Is this some dramatic \nimprovement in the deficit? I wish it was, but I think people can reach \ntheir own conclusion. I think it is a pretty modest improvement over \nlast year's deficit.\n  At the same time, the thing that is getting no attention is the real \nthreat to our long-term economic security, and that is the debt of the \ncountry. And the debt increase last year was $551 billion. With these \nnew numbers this morning, the debt this year will increase by $593 \nbillion. So the amount of the debt increase is actually growing. The \ndebt is getting bigger, and it is getting bigger than it was last year. \nThat is even with these new numbers. This is almost a $600 billion \nincrease in the debt.\n  The White House is saying: Well, there has been this dramatic \nimprovement in revenue, and that proves that if you cut taxes, you get \nmore revenue. No, that is not what it proves. I wish it would prove \nthat because then we really would have the tooth fairy working for us. \nThat would be great. Wouldn't it be wonderful? You cut taxes, you get \nmore money. But here is what has happened. Here is the historical \nrecord.\n  In 2000, revenue, as a percentage of gross domestic product, was \nabout 21 percent. It is true that this year we are getting an increase \nover last year's revenue, but it is still way below what it was back in \n2000. If you look at it on an inflation-adjusted basis, you look at the \nrevenues that we have received, you adjust it for inflation, what you \nsee is now, in 2006, we are getting back to the revenue we had in 2000. \nSo in 2000, we had over $2 trillion in revenue. We had massive tax cuts \nin 2001 and revenue went down. In 2003, revenue went down some more. We \nhad another big tax cut. Revenue stayed down for 2004 and 2005. Now, \nonly in 2006, are they projecting that revenue will go beyond what it \nwas in 2000.\n  This is not proof of the theory of the tooth fairy that if you cut \ntaxes, you get more revenue. In fact, if you look at individual income \ntaxes, where most of the tax cuts have been, you see--and this is not \nadjusted for inflation; this is in nominal terms--we had $1 trillion of \nindividual income tax revenue in 2000. You can see every year after \nthat: 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, every one of those years we had \nless revenue than we had all the way back in 2000. It was not until \nthis year that they are now projecting that we will have somewhat of an \nincrease over the level of revenue in 2000.\n  If one wants to talk about projections, if you go back to their \nprojections in January of 2001, they said this year we would have $2.7 \ntrillion of revenue. Instead, we are going to have $2.4 trillion in \nrevenue. So we are far below what they projected back in 2001.\n  This is from the New York Times of July 9:\n\n       Revenues are still below historical norms. One reason the \n     run-up in taxes looks good is because the past five years \n     looked so bad. Revenues are up, but they have lagged well \n     behind economic growth. Compared with the size of the \n     economy, tax revenues are still below historical norms and \n     far below what the administration predicted as recently as \n     2003.\n\n  ``Far below.'' This is not this magic supply-side epiphany that some \nare now claiming today. In fact, if one looks at the debt, the increase \nin the debt, here is what one sees. When President Bush took office at \nthe end of his first full year--because obviously he is not responsible \nfor the first year; he is inheriting a budget--at the end of his first \nfull year, the debt was $5.8 trillion. At the end of this year, they \nare now saying it will be $8.5 trillion. And in 2011, they are now \nsaying the debt will reach $11.5 trillion. This is an explosion of \ndebt, and they are claiming great success. Excuse me. This is a\n\n[[Page S7303]]\n\ngreat success? What would a failure be? They will have doubled the \nnational debt.\n  When we look at foreign holdings of U.S. debt, here is what we see. \nIt took 42 Presidents--all these Presidents pictured here--224 years to \nrun up $1 trillion of external debt--U.S. debt held abroad. This \nPresident has more than doubled that amount in just 5 years. This is a \nsuccess? I don't think so.\n  Looked at another way, it is stunning. Here are the world's biggest \nborrowers. If you look at all of the money that is being borrowed in \nthe world, you see the United States in the No. 1 position. We are \nborrowing 65 percent of all of the money that is available to borrow. \nLet me repeat that. The United States is borrowing 65 percent of all of \nthe money that is available to borrow. Look at this. We have the United \nKingdom borrowing about 4 percent of what is available; Spain, 7 \npercent; Australia, 3 percent; France, about 3 percent; Italy, 2 \npercent; Turkey, 2 percent. And the United States is borrowing 65 \npercent of all of the money being borrowed in the world. This is not a \nsustainable course. This is not something that can be continued.\n\n  So while the White House is out bragging about their achievements, \nlet's just remember their budget record: Four years in a row of record \ndeficits, debt projected to soar to more than $11 trillion by 2011. \nThey have more than doubled foreign-held debt in 5 years. There is very \nlittle real revenue growth since 2000. Revenues in 2006 are still far \nbelow original projection. And every penny of Social Security surplus \nis projected to be spent on tax cuts and other things over the next 10 \nyears. Again, $2.5 trillion of Social Security money is going to be \nspent on other things. On the other hand, they say there is a big \nshortage of Social Security? Well, they are helping to create it.\n  A new budget process proposal has been made by our friends on the \nother side that would circumvent Social Security protections and fast-\ntrack a Social Security privatization plan. They have repealed and \nincreased the spending caps for next year that they put in place last \nyear. They have come out with a big, new plan, more spending caps, more \nbudget points of order, but they just repealed the spending caps they \nput in place last year. Now we are told they will not have a budget \nthis year at all. The country simply will not have a budget.\n  The Comptroller General of the United States has warned that the \nbudget outlook is getting worse, not better. This is what he said: Our \nproblem is our large, long-term deficit, and the sooner we deal with \nthat, the better.\n  Walker, the Comptroller General, warned of a false sense of security: \n``We're in much worse shape fiscally today than we were just a few \nyears ago.'' He said this on July 11.\n  Mr. President, the Comptroller General is telling the truth. Our \nbudget situation is not getting better; our budget situation is getting \nmuch worse.\n  Here is what is happening to the debt. You didn't hear the President \nmention anything about the debt. They don't want to talk about the debt \nbecause the debt is exploding. The debt is going up, up, and away. And \nthis is before the baby boomers retire. If the budget were to pass that \nhas gone through both Houses of Congress--which we are now told is not \ngoing to pass, we are not going to have a budget--if it were to pass, \nthey would add $3 trillion to the debt over the next 5 years. It is \nsimply stunning.\n  The former CBO Director who, by the way, was an economic adviser to \nthe President before he was CBO Director, said this: ``The long-term \noutlook is such a deep well of sorrow that I can't get much happiness \nout of this year,'' said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former Director of the \nCongressional Budget Office and a former White House economist under \nPresident Bush. He is telling the truth.\n  This notion that there has been some dramatic decrease in the deficit \njust misses the fact. The fact is the deficit last year--the actual \ndeficit--was $318 billion. Now they are forecasting it is going to be \n$296 billion this year. That is not some great improvement. That is an \nimprovement, but it is very modest.\n  At the same time the deficit is getting a little better, the debt is \ngetting a whole lot worse. Last year, the debt increased by $551 \nbillion. This year, the debt is going to increase by $593 billion.\n  All this happy talk today from the administration about how great \nthings are reminds me a little of somebody holding a press conference \nto brag about the new lifeboats on the Titanic. Yes, it is a nice thing \nthat the deficit numbers are a little better, but it misses the larger \nreality. The larger reality is this ship of State is in deep trouble. \nWe are in an ocean of red ink, and nothing substantial is being done \nabout it under this administration. Instead, the debt is growing and \ngrowing dramatically.\n  Even with these new numbers, that is what is happening to the debt of \nour country. It is skyrocketing, and it is skyrocketing at the worst \npossible time--before the baby boomers retire. Remember, the baby \nboomers are going to start retiring--the leading edge--those eligible \nfor Social Security, in 2008, and we are going to leave them a legacy \nof debt unprecedented in our Nation's history.\n  The President does a disservice to the country, as do members of his \nadministration, when they talk about the fiscal circumstance \ndramatically improving. It is not. It is not. The deficit has improved \nmodestly over the deficit of last year, but the debt is actually \ngrowing more rapidly than the debt grew last year. And there is \nabsolutely no relief anywhere in sight. The President and this \nadministration owes it to the American people to come forward with a \nplan to address this crisis of debt.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we are going to \nproceed to vote on the Vitter amendment at 12:15; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me quickly respond to some of the \npoints made by the Senator from North Dakota, whom I greatly admire and \nenjoy working with on the Budget Committee because I think the context \nof those comments have to be put in proper form. There is no question \nbut that the revenues of this country dropped significantly at the \nbeginning of this administration. There is obviously a significant \nargument as to why those revenues dropped. The point that I made \nearlier, and which I think is very valid, is that coming out of the \n1990s we had experienced an explosion of growth, much of which was \nunsupported. It was called a bubble, the Internet bubble. What is a \nbubble? That is when people are speculating irrationally--as at the \ntime Chairman Greenspan said, irrational exuberance--irrationally in a \nway that is basically creating stock, in this instance, which has no \nsubstance behind it but is still being sold at a higher and higher \nprice.\n\n  That bubble burst. When a bubble bursts, the history of economics is \nthat there is a severe contraction in the economy that is experiencing \nthe bubble. That is what happened to us. We saw a severe recession \nbegin.\n  We followed the Internet bubble bursting with the attacks of 9/11. \nThat was a huge catastrophe for us as a nation, a vicious attack \nkilling thousands of Americans, but it was also an attack on our \neconomy.\n  These two events together would have led to a massive slowdown in our \neconomy had not the President had the foresight to reduce the tax rates \nto a more fair level so that entrepreneurs, people who are willing to \ntake risks, were willing to go out and do exactly that. The tax cuts \nwere put in place, and the tax cuts benefitted everybody who paid \ntaxes. It is hard to do a tax cut to benefit people who do not pay \ntaxes, which seems to be the position of the people on the other side \nof the aisle. Essentially, the tax cuts benefitted all who pay taxes, \nbut, importantly, it was to create an atmosphere where the \nentrepreneurs in our Nation, the people who are willing to take risks \nand as a result create jobs, did exactly that. They were rewarded for \nbeing risk takers and job creators. As a result a recession which \nshould have been severe in its slope ended up being shallow.\n  We are now seeing ourselves coming out of that recession. Now, for 39 \nmonths, we have had a very strong recovery, a recovery which is played\n\n[[Page S7304]]\n\ndown by the other side of the aisle but cannot be played down by the \nfacts--5.4 million jobs created, 39 months of economic growth, some of \nthe strongest growth periods we have had in the post-World War II \nperiod, and that has been driven in large part by tax rates which have \ngenerated more revenues to the Federal Government.\n  The theory on the other side of the aisle, and their whole modus \noperandi for economic activity, is you should raise taxes in order to \nraise revenue for the Federal Government to meet spending. You can \nalways expand spending because you can always raise taxes. That is \nbasically the philosophy of the other side of the aisle, coined as \n``tax and spend,'' or ``spend and tax.'' But the fact is--and it has \nbeen proven by three Presidents of both parties--that if you reduce \nrates to a level which gives people an incentive to go out and be \nproductive, you actually generate more revenue for the Federal \nGovernment than if you overtax them.\n  Why is that? It is human nature. If you say to a person: 70 percent \nof the next dollar you earn, or 50 percent of the next dollar you earn \nis going to go to the Federal Government or to the State government or \nthe local government or a combination, a person doesn't have a whole \nlot of incentive to go out there and take a risk with their money or to \nwork harder to produce that extra dollar. But if you say to a person: \nWe are going to tax you at a fair rate so when you go out and take \nrisks with your money you are going to get a fair return and the \nGovernment is going to get a fair return in taxes, then a person is \nwilling to go out and take that risk and do those things that create \nthose jobs.\n  That is exactly what has happened under the tax laws that President \nBush has put in place with the support of the Republican Congress. We \nhave taken those elements of the tax law which are most related to \ncreating economic activity--capital formation, risk-taking activity and \nthus resulting in job creation--and put those rates at reasonable \nlevels, capital gains being the best example of that. The other side of \nthe aisle wants to raise all these taxes again. What they are unwilling \nto acknowledge is that by having a fair rate of those taxes, at those \ntax levels, we have actually generated a huge increase in revenues. If \nyou combine the last 2 years, we have the most significant increase in \nrevenues that we have seen anytime in the post-World War II period for \na 2-year period in rate of growth of revenues. It is because there has \nbeen an incentive for people to go out and be productive, create jobs, \nand as a result generate more income for the Federal Treasury.\n  There is another effect, for example, of the lower capital gains rate \nwhich I mentioned earlier today. Not only does it create economic \nactivity. In other words, if you are sitting on some stocks or sitting \non a piece of real estate or you have a small family business, you are \nafraid to sell it because you don't want to pay the Government 30 \npercent, which was the rate, or 20 percent, which was the rate. Now the \nrate is 15 percent, and you say: I guess I can sell that asset.\n\n  All right, you go out and sell that asset. The Federal Government \nwould have never gotten any revenue from that asset because you were \ngoing to sit on it as long as the rates were too high, so by selling \nthe asset the Federal Government got income it didn't expect, by having \na fair rate.\n  But more important, or equally important, you have that cash. You are \ngoing to go out and reinvest it in something that is going to produce \nmore money and, as a natural flow of human nature, it is going to be \nmore productive. You are going to get more productivity out of those \ndollars. What does that do? It creates more jobs. It creates more \neconomic activity which creates more jobs.\n  And it works. It has been proven to work by President Kennedy, by \nPresident Reagan, and now by President Bush. It worked so well that \nover the last 2 years, the CBO estimated that the revenues from capital \ngains would be half of what they actually were because they used the \nstatic model. They didn't factor in human reaction. So we generated \nalmost $100 billion more revenue just from capital gains than we \nexpected to get as a result of the CBO estimates. That is because human \nnature inherently, certainly in America at least, is entrepreneurial. \nIt is risk taker and job creator oriented, and people who are risk \ntakers are rewarded for that, and as a result jobs are created.\n  So we have had this explosion of jobs in America. We have created \nmore jobs in this country in the last 2 years than Europe and Japan \ncombined--I believe is the statistic. Equally important, we have \ngenerated huge amounts of new revenues for the Federal Government. That \nis reflected in the midterm report which came out today and which is so \ndismissed by the other side of the aisle.\n  You just can't dismiss the fact that we reduced the deficit by $126 \nbillion, approximately, in 6 months, over what it was supposed to be, \nwhat we expected it to be. Why did it come down $126 billion? Because \npeople were paying more in taxes because there was more job activity \nout there.\n  Interestingly enough, most of that new revenue came from the highest \nincome taxpayers in America today. In fact, they are paying more in \ntaxes today than they have ever paid, that group of individuals.\n  But the attitude of the other side of the aisle is, let's just raise \ntaxes again. It doesn't work. It actually reduces revenues if you get \ntaxes too high. What we have to do is control spending. That is why \nthis side of the aisle has been talking about a comprehensive package \nto accomplish that.\n  I see the Senator from Pennsylvania is here. I know he wished to \nspeak. We have about 6 minutes. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4548, As Modified\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the amendment that I \nunderstand we are going to be voting on in about 6 minutes. I am not \nparticularly pleased we are voting on this amendment in 6 minutes, that \nI only have 6 minutes to talk about this amendment on the importation \nof prescription drugs. I think what we are potentially about to do is \nsomething that is very dangerous, something that is a risk to consumers \nand patients in this country.\n  We have seen exposes written by newspapers. We have seen reports from \nthe Surgeon General. We have seen reports by numerous government \nagencies, of the risk associated with drugs coming into this country \nfrom potentially dangerous foreign sources, prescription drugs, that \nare being used by people in this country. There is a profound risk of \nthem being impure, contaminated, and having potency problems. Now we \nare back here on a quick amendment, and a quick time agreement, and we \nare going to have a vote on something that I think is life threatening \nto potentially thousands of individuals in this country.\n  This is an amendment that says, to my knowledge--I have it in front \nof me, but I understand it has been modified, and I have not yet seen \nthe modification--that none of the funds in this bill will be made \navailable for the Customs and Border Protection agents to prevent \nindividuals from importing prescription drugs.\n  I understand it has been modified to say just from Canada. But, of \ncourse, how do we know they are from Canada? If a border agent sees a \nbox that says ``from Canada'' or ``FDA approved'' or whatever, does \nthat mean they can't look at it or can't examine it?\n  This is a very crude attempt to try to get around an issue that we \nhave been debating for a long time, and that is, whether it is safe to \nallow people to get drugs, from other countries, that do not have the \nFDA safety and efficacy approvals.\n  We have huge concern in this Chamber, huge concerns around the United \nStates with drug safety. There is a pill called Vioxx that has a small \nchance of causing certain side-effects in some individuals. Yet we want \nto allow importation of potentially dangerous drugs from other \ncountries.\n  Let's look at the reports of analysis of some so called ``Canadian \ngenerics'' seized at the boarder. Experts in drug safety tell us that \nthese drugs often have problems with potency, don't dissolve correctly, \nor have dangerous impurities. These are potentially dangerous drugs, \nand the United States Senate wants to say: Go ahead and bring those \ndrugs in, but by the way, we have to take Vioxx off the market if there \nis even a 1-percent chance of hurting somebody.\n  Drug importation done this way has a nearly 100-percent chance of \nhurting\n\n[[Page S7305]]\n\nsomebody, and we are going to come to the floor of the United States \nSenate and say that is a good idea because it might save a few dollars.\n  We addressed this issue for our most vulnerable population. We \naddressed it for seniors. We passed a Medicare prescription drug bill \nthat is working. It is working very well. It is lowering costs of \nprescription drugs to our seniors. Providing affordable drugs of \nquality, FDA approved, we know they are safe, we know they are \neffective, they are made here in the United States.\n  We have folks who are going to vote for this amendment who complain \nnight and day about exporting jobs around the world. What do you think \nthis is? When these drugs are made in the United States they are made \nsafe and effective. They are made by American workers. And we know they \nwork for people who need these drugs. We are going to export these jobs \nto Bangladesh or Ghana or Belize--pick a country--which happens to mark \nthe drug ``from Canada''?\n  If you write ``Canada'' on there, assume a border guard, just to be \nsafe, will say don't open it because we may be breaking the law \naccording to this amendment.\n  This is a dangerous piece of legislation for potentially thousands if \nnot more persons who are looking for a cheap prescription and could get \na prescription for ineffective treatment, which could lead to more \nproblems, or potentially lethal treatment if there are dangerous side \neffects from impure drugs.\n  We should not be voting on this amendment, in my opinion. But the \nvote has been locked in--without my consent, I might add. What we are \nto do here--let's not muddy the water--this is not about cheap drugs. \nWe have dealt with that issue for seniors. We have dealt with that \nissue by putting up huge amounts of money to make sure that our seniors \nget good-quality, American-made drugs, made by Americans who have good-\nquality jobs making them. This is about hurting those Americans making \nthese drugs as well as hurting people who are going to be consuming \nthese drugs.\n  I am not happy, even though I understand we will look at this in \nconference and it can be striped out in conference. This is bad public \npolicy. This is dangerous to the health of American citizens, and it \nhurts our economy. It says to a border guard or the Customs Service \nthat is already overburdened, that already has too much of a job to \ndo--how are they going to know whether it is made in Canada or not? How \nare they going to know whether it came from Canada or not? This is a \npotentially monstrous problem. This is an enforcement problem. This is \ngoing to create huge problems on a number of levels.\n  I hope Members vote against this. I am going to vote against it. This \nis not the right way to do this, No. 1, to withhold money from the \nBorder Patrol so they don't do their job. If you want to debate the \nissue of whether we should adopt Canadian-style drug pricing, fine; \nlet's do that. We did that last session of Congress, and 38 Senators \nvoted to allow Canada to set prices for drugs in America. That is how \nbad things are, in my opinion, in this Chamber when it comes to this \nissue.\n  This country's pharmaceutical industry is the envy of the world. We \nare the envy of the world for our biotech and pharmaceutical treatments \nand cures. We discover over 50 percent of the new drugs in the world. \nWe have research jobs. We employ the best and brightest scientists in \nthe world here in the United States. What do we want to do? We want to \ndestroy that. We want to completely go around safety and effectiveness, \ncompletely go around the FDA and bring in counterfeit, bogus drugs to \nlet our seniors or let other people use those drugs because it is a \npolitical advantage to doing it, to saying we are for cheap drugs. You \nare for harming people if you vote for this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I understand that the unanimous consent \nrequest did not include the yeas and nays. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is 2 minutes \nequally divided on the Vitter amendment, as modified.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment. I \nthank Senators Nelson and Coburn and others for their support.\n  This is very simple and straightforward. It will simply say in the \npost-9/11 world to Customs and border security that they should not be \nspending precious time and precious resources confiscating prescription \ndrugs from seniors as they come back into this country from Canada. \nThat is the only thing the amendment does. It is only about Canada. It \nis only about the personal use of prescription drugs. It doesn't \ninvolve wholesale, and it doesn't involve large quantities which can be \nresold in this country. It is only about FDA-approved drugs or their \nequivalent or what would be FDA-approved drugs if FDA did not define \ntheir approval process to specifically exclude drugs from other \ncountries.\n  I ask for strong support of this very commonsense amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time in opposition to the amendment?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the Senator from Louisiana said it only \nconcerns Canadian drugs. Let's take a look at what FDA said when they \nlooked at so-called Canadian generic drugs ordered from a website \nclaiming to sell drugs from Canada.\n  Where was the website registered? China. Where was the post office \naddress? Dallas, TX. Where was the return address? Miami, FL. Where was \nthe credit card billed? St. Kitts. And where was the phone number \nlisted? Belize. Canadian pharmacies, legal under this new amendment \ncoming in from Canada. Canadian? Really? Where was this stuff made? We \ndon't know. Probably China. Maybe not. Is it FDA approved? Is it \nlicensed? Safe and effective? No, no, no.\n  This is dangerous stuff.\n  For U.S. Senators to stand up and say, We have concerns about Vioxx \nif there is even a 1-percent potential problem for somebody who uses \nit, but we are going to let drugs come in from God knows where, that \nare potentially ineffective and deadly, is a travesty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas modified. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 68, nays 32, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 191 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--68\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     Dayton\n     DeMint\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Grassley\n     Harkin\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Talent\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--32\n\n     Alexander\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     McConnell\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n  The amendment (No. 4548), as modified, was agreed to.\n\n  Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I was just saying as I came in, I saw \nthese young pages here--I have been around here quite a long time, but \nI haven't gotten used to these. Our country has put a man on the Moon \nand brought him back to Earth again, but it hasn't yet perfected a \nreally good public address system. A Senator such as myself is not used \nto the public address system and has to learn how to use the ones we \nhave.\n  As I was saying, I said the person who really introduced court \nreporting in the Roman Senate was Cicero, which I will discuss at \nanother time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4557\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, when the President sent his budget to the \nCongress in February, it was based on a false premise. The President's \nbudget assumed that the Appropriations Committees would raise the \naviation fees on airline passengers by $1.23 billion. The President and \nhis advisers at the Office of Management and Budget were aware that the \nCongress would not approve this tax increase on airline passengers \nbecause the administration tried a similar proposal last year, and the \nCongress responded with a bipartisan no. Thus, the President's budget \nis kind of a hollow one--h-o-l-l-o-w, hollow. It leaves a gaping $1.23 \nbillion hole in the homeland security budget.\n  The chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Cochran, \nprovided the subcommittee with some additional resources, but the fact \nremains that this bill is still $515 million below the President's \nrequest and $350 million lower than the bill that was passed by the \nHouse of Representatives last month.\n  The amendment I am offering today attempts to rectify this \ndiscrepancy. My amendment provides an additional $350 million for \nborder security infrastructure enhancements, and it is fully paid for.\n  I am pleased that the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Gregg, is \nworking with me on this amendment. As we continue to hire more Border \nPatrol agents and other immigration enforcement officials, we need to \ngive them the tools they need to do their job, and we need to start \npaying for those tools now so they will be available as more and more \nBorder Patrol and immigration enforcement officials are hired and \ntrained.\n  The Border Patrol needs new helicopters because the average age of \nits helicopters is nearly 40 years. The average age of our Customs \nprimary fixed-wing aircraft is 30 years. All of our border enforcement \nofficials, including the newly hired officials, need more vehicles, \nincluding all-terrain vehicles, high endurance vehicles, and even more \nbuses to transport and remove illegal aliens.\n  Customs and Border Protection has a requirement for 18 unmanned \naerial vehicles, or UAVs. The Senate-passed immigration bill authorizes \nmore UAVs. Yet the only one we had operating on our border crashed in \nthe desert this past spring.\n  The amendment I am offering provides real dollars for our aging \nborder infrastructure. It provides $90 million for additional fencing, \ntactical border infrastructure, and facilities. It provides $105 \nmillion for air and marine items, such as new helicopters, unmanned \naerial vehicles, the standing up of all planned northern border air \nwings, and the facilities to house and maintain these aircraft. It \nprovides $55 million for replacement vehicles for our border and \nimmigration personnel, and it also provides $15 million for the ongoing \nInformation Technology Modernization Program at Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement.\n  The President's budget requested $47 million in direct appropriations \nfor the Business Transformation Program at U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services. Because of the hollowness of the President's \nbudget submission, these funds were not included in the bill reported \nout of committee. The program is a multiyear effort to modernize \nimmigration benefits services.\n  So this amendment will help to reduce the rate of fraud in the \nprogram and to ensure the security and the integrity of the immigration \nsystem. This amendment provides the $47 million requested by the \nPresident for this program.\n  Finally, my amendment adds $38 million for fraud detection and \nnational security activities at USCIS. This $38 million will add 100 \nnew positions to enable FDNS to conduct benefit fraud assessments of \nadditional immigration benefits, including training efforts necessary \nto further enhance the background checking process. We must have the \ntechnology and trained personnel in place now if we are to ensure that \nonly those individuals who are legally allowed to be in this country \nare obtaining benefits and other privileges.\n\n  How is the amendment paid for? The amendment is fully paid for \nthrough increases in existing fees on non-U.S. citizens.\n  Border security in this country must be more than just a political \nslogan in this campaign year. Do you know this is a campaign year? I \ndo. I am running. Border security must be one of the Nation's top \npriorities. The people out there watching through those lenses will \nagree with that. Border security must be one of this Nation's top \npriorities.\n  The United States is on track to hire over 6,500 new Border Patrol \nagents and immigration enforcement officers. But what happens once they \nare on the job? Do we send them to the border without weapons, without \nradios, without trucks and Jeeps? Without this amendment, without these \nresources, we will be telling our Border Patrol agents in essence to \nstem the tide of illegal immigration with little more than a polite \nsmile--little more than a polite smile. Asking illegal immigrants to \nplease turn around just won't cut it. Our Border Patrol must have the \nlaw enforcement resources to get the job done.\n  If we are truly serious about securing our borders--and not just \nengaging in hollow rhetoric--then we will put real dollars on the \nborder. I commend my chairman, Senator Gregg, for his support, and I \nurge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], for himself, Mr. \n     Gregg, Ms. Murray, Mr. Rockefeller, and Mr. Bingaman, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4557.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide additional resources for border infrastructure and \n                     program integrity initiatives)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill insert the following:\n\n                                TITLE VI\n\n              BORDER SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE ENHANCEMENTS\n\n       Sec. 601. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     the Secretary of Homeland Security shall adjust fees charged \n     by the Department against any non-United States citizen by \n     notice in the Federal Register no later than January 1, 2007, \n     to achieve not less than $350,000,000 in additional receipts \n     by September 30, 2007: Provided, That the\n\n[[Page S7307]]\n\n     Secretary may adjust only those fees authorized under the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act and the Illegal Immigration \n     Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act: Provided further, \n     That this adjustment shall be in addition to fees authorized \n     under 8 United States Code 1356.\n       (b) Amounts collected under subsection (a) shall be \n     deposited in the accounts as provided by 8 United States Code \n     1356: Provided, That of the total amount collected pursuant \n     to subsection (a) the Secretary shall transfer the following \n     amounts:\n       (1) $25,000,000 to Customs and Border Protection ``Salaries \n     and Expenses'' for vehicle replacement;\n       (2) $105,000,000 to Customs and Border Protection ``Air and \n     Marine Interdiction, Operations, Maintenance, and \n     Procurement'' for air asset replacement and air operations \n     facilities upgrades;\n       (3) $90,000,000 to Customs and Border Protection \n     ``Construction'';\n       (4) $30,000,000 to Immigration and Customs Enforcement \n     ``Salaries and Expenses'' for vehicle replacement; and,\n       (5) $15,000,000 to Immigration and Customs Enforcement \n     ``Automation Modernization''.\n       (c) Of the total amount collected pursuant to subsection \n     (a) $85,000,000 shall be made available to United States \n     Citizenship and Immigration Services: Provided, That of the \n     additional amount available, $47,000,000 shall be for \n     Business Transformation and $38,000,000 shall be for Fraud \n     Detection and National Security initiatives.\n       (d) Amounts deposited under paragraph (b) shall remain \n     available until expended for the activities and services \n     described in paragraphs (b) and (c).\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to commend the Senator from West \nVirginia for this amendment. Everything that he is proposing to fund in \nthis amendment is needed and is critical. There is no question but that \nthe agencies to which he is giving these additional dollars for the \npurposes of refurbishing both air and vehicle fleets are in dire need \nof these dollars, as he cited in his statement. The aircraft owned by \nCustoms is 30 years beyond its useful life. Helicopters are averaging \n20 years beyond their useful life. The vehicles in which these folks go \nout to protect our borders often break down and many times they can't \nfulfill their missions because the vehicles are not up to the capacity \nthat is needed.\n  So this is a good amendment. It is a needed amendment. I support it. \nSenator Byrd has found an offset which is a reasonable offset. It \nincreases the fees for non-Americans who seek to use the Immigration \nService and the Customs Service--mostly the Immigration Service, I \nbelieve. This will not raise blue slip issues. So I am in support of \nthis amendment and urge its adoption.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 4557 be \nagreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4557) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my chairman for his support. I ask \nunanimous consent that further consideration of the amendment be \nwaived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4559\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the President of the United States, in his \nJanuary State of the Union Address, told America: ``The enemy has not \nlost the desire or the capability to attack us.'' He was right. I am \nsure the President is correct about that. But some of the speech \nwriters and policy writers for the administration seem to be living in \nalternative worlds.\n  After the administration's decision to allow Dubai Ports World to \noperate terminals in six major U.S. ports, the administration asserted \nthat it has a robust, layered security system for our ports. Yet the \nWhite House has proposed for the second straight year now to eliminate \nthe Port Security Grant Program.\n  How serious is the administration about port security when it decides \nto allow Dubai Ports World to control six major U.S. ports? How serious \nis the administration when it underfunds port security? How serious are \nthey about port security when Customs and Border Protection inspects \nonly 5 percent of the 11 million containers that come into the country \neach year? How serious is the administration about port security when \nthe Coast Guard inspects only one-third of the foreign ports that trade \nwith our country? How serious is the administration when the Coast \nGuard Deepwater budget for replacing its ships, planes, and helicopters \nwill not be completed until 2026? How old will I be then, in 2026? \nWell, it really doesn't matter. That is 20 years away.\n  How serious are they when it takes over 11 months to make grant funds \navailable to ports for needed security measures?\n  My amendment would provide $648 million to fill critical gaps in our \npaper-thin--paper-thin--do you see how thin this paper is--our paper-\nthin port security programs. The amendment would provide resources for \nmore container inspection equipment and personnel, more port \ninspections, more Coast Guard ships, more Coast Guard planes that are \nessential to securing our borders, and more port security grants.\n  Currently, only 5 percent of all of the cargo containers entering the \nUnited States are physically inspected by opening the containers. Now, \nthis is paper-thin security. My amendment would fund 60 more cargo \ncontainer imaging machines at our seaports and rail border crossings \nthat can view inside a container. It will also fund the hiring of 354 \nadditional Customs and Border Protection officers to inspect these \ncontainers and address anomalies in cargo containers that may be \ntriggered by the radiation portal monitors deployed at the ports.\n  Currently, the Coast Guard has only 82 inspectors to conduct facility \ninvestment compliance at domestic ports and 34 inspectors to review \nsecurity plans at foreign ports. Of the 144 countries that conduct \nmaritime trade with our country, the Coast Guard has assessed security \nat only 51. At the current rate of inspections, Coast Guard inspectors \nwill visit countries that trade with the United States only once every \n4 years. Now, this is paper-thin security.\n  Under my amendment, the Coast Guard would complete the assessment of \nall 144 countries every 2 years. My amendment would also provide the \nCoast Guard with funding to conduct random spot checks of all domestic \nport facilities and assess the vulnerability of our most strategic \nports here at home.\n  Domestically, the Coast Guard inspects the 3,064 U.S. facilities that \nare subject to the Maritime Transportation Security Act regulations \njust once per year. The Coast Guard has no funding to conduct random \nspot checks of these facilities. My amendment includes funding for \napproximately 80 new positions to establish a robust spot check program \nat each Coast Guard sector office, an important element in any \nenforcement regime, wouldn't you think so?\n  The Coast Guard has completed vulnerability assessments at 55 \nmilitarily and economically strategic ports. Currently, no funding is \navailable to update these assessments which were completed 2 years ago. \nBut my amendment would allow the Coast Guard to reassess the \nvulnerability of approximately 10 ports.\n  The condition of Coast Guard ships and planes is declining rapidly. \nThese assets spend more and more time out of service. For example, \ntotal patrol boat hours in 2004 were 25 percent lower than in 1998. \nCurrent Coast Guard maritime patrol airplanes can only provide half of \nthe hours required to meet operational commitments. At the same time, \nfunding constraints require maintenance on these aging assets to be \ndeferred more and more every year.\n  My amendment provides $184 million for the Coast Guard to buy new \npatrol boats, maintain existing cutters, buy new maritime patrol \naircraft, and arm its helicopters for homeland defense in U.S. ports \nand harbors.\n  Coast Guard Patrol boats are operating in theater less today than \nthey were in 1998. Total boat hours were only 75,000 in 2004, compared \nto the 1998 baseline of approximately 100,000 hours. The decline in \noperational hours has been the result of aging assets and the loss of 8 \npatrol boats deployed to the Middle East for Operation Iraqi Freedom. \nUnder the Coast Guard's Deepwater modernization plan, this gap won't be \nclosed until 2012 at the earliest. Funding in my amendment would enable \nthe Coast Guard to purchase 2 additional patrol boats for a total of 5 \nin fiscal year 2007. This will provide the Coast Guard with 6,000 \ndesperately needed Deepwater patrol boat hours in drug and migrant \ntransit zones.\n  Finally, my amendment includes $190 million for port security grants, \nwhich would bring fiscal year 2007 funding to $400 million. The Coast \nGuard estimates that $5.4 billion is needed\n\n[[Page S7308]]\n\nthrough 2012 for security at our ports. To date, only 15 percent of \nthat amount has been funded despite the fact that United States ports \nhandle over 95 percent of U.S. overseas trade. Last year, Homeland \nSecurity was able to fund only 24 percent of the projects requested. \nThis is paper-thin security.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the American Association \nof Port Authorities supporting the amendment be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1)\n  Mr. BYRD. The White House knew, when it sent the budget to the \nCongress, that the funding relied on a tax hike on air travelers--a tax \nhike the Congress had already rejected. The Appropriations committees \nlack jurisdiction to increase the aviation passenger tax, and, of \ncourse could not do so in this bill. As a result, despite Chairman \nGregg's best efforts, the bill that is before the Senate does not \nprovide the necessary resources for port security. My amendment \naddresses that shortfall.\n  Just 2 months ago, the Senate approved my $648 million port security \namendment to the supplemental. Regrettably, the President threatened to \nveto the supplemental unless what he characterized as low-priority \nspending was dropped from the bill. In conference, port security \nfunding was stricken from the supplemental. I hope that the Senate will \napprove this port security amendment again and that this time, it \nsurvives in conference.\n  The amendment is within the allocation available to the subcommittee \nfor fiscal year 2006.\n  The American people expect more than just a paper-thin security plan \nfor our ports. I thank Chairman Gregg for his support.\n  I thank my illustrious chairman, Senator Gregg, for his support, and \nI urge the adoption of my amendment.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                              American Association\n\n\n                                          of Port Authorities,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, July 10, 2006.\n     To: All Members of the United States Senate.\n     From: Kurt Nagle, President and CEO, American Association of \n         Port Authorities.\n     Subj: Support Port Security Amendment on the Senate Floor.\n\n       As a member of the United States Senate, I am writing to \n     urge you to support an amendment to the Department of \n     Homeland Security's (DHS) FY '07 appropriations bill being \n     offered tomorrow by Senator Byrd to increase funding for port \n     security. This amendment represents a critical opportunity to \n     make port security a higher priority for this nation. The \n     American Association of Port Authorities (AAPA) represents \n     the leading public ports in the U.S., handling most of the \n     maritime cargo imported or exported from this country. We \n     strongly endorse this amendment to provide an additional $635 \n     million to enhance port security by providing: an increase in \n     port security grants, additional port security inspectors at \n     foreign and domestic ports, additional cargo container \n     inspection equipment, and improved maritime security through \n     expedited purchase of Coast Guard planes and boats.\n       Earlier this year, Congress and this nation focused its \n     attention on the P Ports/Dubai Ports World transaction, \n     which resulted in a nationwide debate on port security and \n     calls for more security funding for this critical \n     transportation asset. In response, the Senate and the House \n     began working on legislation to strengthen maritime security. \n     The Senate Greenlane Maritime Security Act (S. 2459--Collins/\n     Murray) and the House SAFE Ports Act (H.R. 4954--Lungren/\n     Harman) both call for significantly more funding for port \n     security. The Senate-based emergency supplemental followed \n     the recommendations in these bills, but much of the port \n     security funding was eliminated due to concerns over the \n     total spending level for the bill.\n       Senator Byrd's amendment is aimed at once again adopting \n     the funding levels in the House and Senate bills and making \n     port security a high priority for this country. AAPA is \n     especially interested in properly funding the Port Security \n     Grant program. The Byrd amendment would bring the funding \n     level up to $400 million for the year. This would help pay \n     for the very costly new regulations DHS has proposed \n     following the Dubai Ports controversy to require all maritime \n     workers and facilities to comply with new Transportation \n     Worker Identification Credential or TWIC requirements. DHS \n     estimates that 40 percent of the $1 billion cost of this \n     regulation will fall on port facilities. By supporting this \n     amendment, Congress will provide federal funds critical to \n     help co-fund this new mandate.\n       With 99% of our international cargo by volume flowing \n     through ports, we urge you to show the nation that port \n     security is a priority in Congress by voting ``yes'' on this \n     port security amendment tomorrow.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise again to express my appreciation to \nthe Senator from West Virginia. He has brought forward an amendment \nwhich addresses critical needs in port security and Coast Guard \nretooling. He has paid for it. My druthers were to take the 2006 \nauthorization allocation which we had and allow it to lapse and go to \ndeficit reduction. That was my initial plan. But I have been here long \nenough to know that if you leave that type of money on the table, \nsomebody else will end up spending it.\n  It is truly a critical need in the area of homeland security that we \naddress the issues which the Senator from West Virginia has put into \nhis package. The Coast Guard is especially important. An example: The \nSenator from West Virginia noted that he is going to fund the adding of \narmament to Coast Guard helicopters. Presently there are about 90 Coast \nGuard helicopters. Four or five are armed. The four or five that are \narmed have a 100-percent interception rate. In other words, when a \nsmuggler is headed toward our shores, either with people or with \ncontraband, if the helicopter that tracks them has armament on it, \nthere is 100 percent interception rate. Those helicopters which do not \nhave armament do not have anywhere near that interception rate.\n  There was an interesting article just a day or so ago in the Miami \npaper, I believe, about how smugglers are coming in and that the Coast \nGuard fast boat tried to catch up with the smugglers. They were in a \ncigarette boat. The cigarette boat turned and was on a course to ram \nthe intercept boats, and the intercept boats called in the armed \nhelicopter and that stopped the confrontation. The smugglers were \narrested.\n  So it is critical that we do this type of upgrading to the Coast \nGuard. In this bill, we had upgraded 36 helicopters. This will upgrade \nanother 30. We are getting pretty close to the entire Coast Guard fleet \nor as much as is needed to have that type of armament on it.\n  In addition, the fast boats are critical, the observation aircraft \nare critical, and then the whole major thrust toward port security is \nequally important.\n  It is a paid-for amendment. It is one that addresses needs that are \nthere, that are obvious. They need to be addressed and were not \naddressed because of the tight resource situation. But, as usual, the \nSenator from West Virginia has been creative, and his proposal is not \nonly reasonable but is an improvement of the bill. I am happy to \nsupport it.\n  I know the Senator from North Dakota wants to speak on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask that my amendment be called up and the \nclerk state it for the consideration of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], for himself, Mr. \n     Gregg, Mr. Kohl, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Menendez, Mrs. Murray, and \n     Mr. Rockefeller, proposes an amendment numbered 4559.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide additional funding for port security enhancements \n                          in fiscal year 2006)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n TITLE VII--SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS FOR PORT SECURITY ENHANCEMENTS\n\n       The following sums are appropriated, out of any money in \n     the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, to enhance port \n     security for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2006, and \n     for other purposes, namely:\n\n                     CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION\n\n                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Salaries and Expenses'', \n     $251,000,000, to remain available until expended.\n\n                       UNITED STATES COAST GUARD\n\n                           OPERATING EXPENSES\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Operating Expenses'', \n     $23,000,000, to remain available until expended: Provided, \n     That funding is available to accelerate foreign port security \n     assessments, conduct domestic port vulnerability assessments, \n     and perform unscheduled security audits of facilities \n     regulated by\n\n[[Page S7309]]\n\n     chapter 701 of title 46, United States Code, commonly known \n     as the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002.\n\n                       UNITED STATES COAST GUARD\n\n              ACQUISITION, CONSTRUCTION, AND IMPROVEMENTS\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Acquisition, Construction, \n     and Improvements'' for acquisition, construction, renovation, \n     and improvement of vessels, aircraft, and equipment, \n     $184,000,000 for the Integrated Deepwater Systems program, to \n     remain available until expended: Provided, That funding is \n     available to acquire maritime patrol aircraft and parent \n     craft patrol boats, to provide armed helicopter capability, \n     and to sustain the medium endurance cutter fleet.\n\n                    OFFICE FOR DOMESTIC PREPAREDNESS\n\n                        STATE AND LOCAL PROGRAMS\n\n       For an additional amount for ``State and Local Programs'', \n     $190,000,000 to remain available until September 30, 2007: \n     Provided, That the entire amount shall be for port security \n     grants pursuant to the purposes of subsection (a) through (h) \n     of section 70107 of title 46, United States Code, which shall \n     be awarded based on risk notwithstanding subsection (a), for \n     eligible costs as defined in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) of \n     subsection (b).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I come from a \nlandlocked State. We don't have a seaport in North Dakota. But I have \ntaken the time to review some of the activities of seaports and learned \na bit about seaports and related that to the issue of security in this \nnew age of terrorism.\n  I come today to support the amendment offered by my colleague from \nWest Virginia. He has been relentless over some long period of time, \nbeing very concerned about seaport security. Let me also commend \nSenator Gregg as well for his work on the underlying legislation and \nalso for his support of the amendment of Senator Byrd.\n  I recall going to a seaport and being shown containers that come in, \nI believe between 5.5 and 6 million containers, stacked on ships that \narrive at the shores of the United States. Then they are put on wheels \nand they are trucked around the country. I asked the question, How many \nof these containers are inspected? The answer at that point was around \n3 percent. I believe now it is something just over 5 percent.\n  They were showing me, at this particular seaport, a container they \nhad opened. It turned out to be a refrigerated container with frozen \nbroccoli from Poland, and it had in it giant bags of frozen broccoli \nfrom Poland. I said, ``What is in the middle of the container? I see \nyou opened the back end and ripped open some bags, and there is frozen \nbroccoli in this container. Is there anything in the middle of these \nbags?''\n  ``That we don't know. We haven't unloaded it. We don't unload most of \nthese. We don't inspect most of these.''\n  Then they showed me the technology that exists by which they could \ninspect, effectively x-raying these containers. So there are ways to \nenhance greater inspection of these containers at seaports.\n  Even though my State doesn't have a seaport, we in the Senate debate \nand provide funding now of about $10 billion a year for the \nantiballistic missile system so we can create a catcher's mitt in case \nsome rogue nation or some terrorist group would fire an \nintercontinental ballistic missile at us that is tipped with a nuclear \nbomb. The likelihood of that is very unlikely. It is one of the least \nlikely things on the threat meter against our country, that a rogue \nnation or terrorist group would acquire a nuclear weapon, put it on top \nof an intercontinental ballistic missile, and have the means to launch \nit at our country, but we spent about $10 billion to try to find a way \nto provide a catcher's mitt and intercept a bullet, with a bullet \ntraveling at 18,000 miles an hour.\n  A much more likely scenario to threaten this country will be a ship \npulling up to the dock of a major American city at 3 miles an hour with \na load of containers on board, one of which may contain a weapon of \nmass destruction. That has been my concern.\n  I think we have done a lot of work to try to extend the envelope and \nextend the line of protection, going actually to other countries. That \nis included, in addition, in this amendment--to have inspectors \noverseas at the point of departure for some of these container ships \nand so on. But there is so much more we must do if we really are going \nto assure ourselves we are not going to allow, coming in at 2 or 3 \nmiles an hour, some large ship carrying containers, one of which--out \nof some 6 million--one of which could threaten to blow up a major \nAmerican city. That is the reason for being concerned about port \nsecurity. It has the purpose of going the extra mile and making the \nextra investment to make sure that we can feel as if we have done \neverything possible to provide security at America's seaports.\n  Let me again thank my colleague from West Virginia. As I said, he has \nbeen relentless. He has been on the Senate floor many times. I have \ntried to come and be supportive when he has offered these amendments \nbecause I feel so strongly about it. And let me again compliment \nSenator Gregg, the chairman of the subcommittee, for his work and also \nfor accepting this amendment\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I speak on behalf of an amendment being \noffered by Senator Byrd which would enhance funding for border security \ninfrastructure. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this important \nlegislation, and I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his hard \nwork on this important bill.\n  The amendment would provide an additional $350 million for critical \nborder security needs. The amendment would allocate $105 million for \ncustoms and border protection to purchase new Border Patrol replacement \nhelicopters, fixed wing aircraft, and additional unmanned aerial \nvehicles. And $25 million is added to the bill to purchase \napproximately 540 additional replacement vehicles for the Border \nPatrol.\n  The amendment would also provide an additional $90 million for \ntactical infrastructure. This funding can be used to construct vehicle \nbarrier, fencing, and facility upgrades. This funding will be of great \nassistance to the state of New Mexico, where such upgrades are needed \nto secure our border. The underlying bill allocates about $57 million \nfor tactical infrastructure in Arizona and about $30 million for San \nDiego. However, the El Paso Sector, which includes the entire State of \nNew Mexico, is only provided about $7.5 million. The additional $90 \nmillion under this amendment will help ensure that New Mexico receives \nthe resources that it needs.\n  The amendment would also prove $30 million for ICE to purchase 800 \nvehicles, including buses and vans, used to transport undocumented \nimmigrants. And USCIS is allocated $38 million to enhance fraud \ndetection systems.\n  These additional resources are greatly needed and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from North Dakota. There is some irony \nin that, although neither the Senator from West Virginia nor the \nSenator from North Dakota has a port, unless Harpers Ferry is \nconsidered a port, they would be putting forward this concept.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is printed in today's Record under Text of amendments.)\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, our amendment would strengthen the \ncapability, stature, and effectiveness of the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency. The language in the amendment is largely drawn from \nS. 3595, the United States Emergency Management Authority Act, which we \nintroduced in this Chamber 2 weeks ago. We believe this is the \nappropriate time and the right vehicle for improving our Nation's \nemergency management system.\n\n[[Page S7310]]\n\nThe wounds of Hurricane Katrina are still fresh. A new hurricane season \nis upon us, and the recent news on the law enforcement and military \nfront reminds us that the terrorist threat to America continues. Bitter \nlessons have been learned from the experience in responding to \nHurricane Katrina, but they have not yet been applied. The time for \naction is now.\n  The amendment reflects the Senate Committee on Homeland Security's 8-\nmonth investigation into the failed preparations for response to \nHurricane Katrina.\n  As the Presiding Officer is well aware, the committee conducted an \nextensive and exhaustive investigation. We held some 23 hearings at \nwhich nearly 90 witnesses testified. We formally interviewed 325 \nindividuals, and we reviewed some 838,000 pages of documents. We \ndistilled all of this into a comprehensive report with many \nrecommendations for improving the response at all levels of government.\n  Some of these recommendations have to do with how the Federal \nGovernment should be organized to effectively respond to future \ndisasters, whether they are manmade or whether they are natural ones \nsuch as Katrina. These recommendations have been distilled in part in \nUSEMA legislation that forms the basis for this amendment.\n  I note that this is the first step in implementing the committee's \ncomprehensive recommendations. We will be introducing a subsequent bill \nto implement other findings and recommendations. Most significant will \nbe a package of reforms to the Stafford Act, but that is not what we \nare proposing today. The amendment before us today has four key \nfeatures. It seeks to restructure, reform, and strengthen the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency, FEMA, which we would rename as the United \nStates Emergency Management Authority.\n  The four key features are as follows: First, it would give this new \nauthority statutory protection against administrative actions that \ncould diminish its capabilities and effectiveness, such as department-\nwide reorganization that could strip essential functions away from the \nnew agency.\n  Second, it would ensure that the administrator has direct access to \nthe President and serve as his principal adviser on emergency \nmanagement issues.\n  Third, it would reunite preparedness functions with response \ncapabilities. After all, preparedness and response are really two sides \nof the same coin. I believe it was a mistake when the Department \ndecided to strip FEMA of its preparedness functions.\n  It would reestablish the agency's comprehensive responsibility and \nrestore a full range of work relationships with State and local \ngovernment, the essential partners in emergency response.\n  Fourth, the amendment would strengthen the new authority's regional \nfocus.\n  I know that as a former mayor the Presiding Officer has a special \nappreciation for just how important it is for the Federal Government to \nwork closely with State and local governments. That is an issue that he \nhas brought up throughout this investigation.\n  We would create Federal strike teams that have representatives from \nall the agencies that are involved on the Federal side of the response. \nThey would be located in regional offices to foster cooperation, \ncoordination, and joint training with State and local emergency \nmanagers and with first responders.\n  A crisis, whether it is due to a hurricane, an ice storm, or a \nterrorist attack is the last time that people should be exchanging \nbusiness cards. We should make sure the Federal, State, and local \ngovernments are training together, planning together, exercising \ntogether; that they know one another; that they know the culture, the \ncapabilities, and the essentials.\n  The overarching objective of the amendment is to strengthen FEMA \nwhich, as I pledged, we would propose to rename as the United States \nEmergency Management Authority. The new name signals a fresh start for \nFEMA with new authority, including some authority that it has never had \nbefore over critical infrastructure, for example. It signifies new \ncapabilities and new responsibilities to all-hazards emergency \npreparedness and response. And, surely, those of us who investigated \nfor some months the failed response to Hurricane Katrina, as well as \nanyone who followed the issue peripherally, can have no doubt that FEMA \nurgently needs to be restructured and reformed to be more effective.\n  Part of this help entails giving the new people a special legal \nstatus within DHS. Our amendment's prohibition against further \ndepartmental reorganization of this agency and mission alterations \naffecting the authority will give USEMA exactly the same kind of \nprotection that has already been extended to the Coast Guard and to the \nSecret Service.\n\n  This is something completely new. We paralleled the kind of \nprotection, the distinct legal status that is given to the Coast Guard \nand to the Secret Service. I know the Coast Guard was the stellar \nperformer in the response to Katrina. The Coast Guard, by all accounts, \ndid an exceptional job in its preparedness and response, yet as part of \nthe Department of Homeland Security.\n  I think those who think the answer is to sever FEMA or the new agency \nfrom the Department should take a hard look at the Coast Guard's \nexperience. But in looking at the Coast Guard, I think we can also \nlearn that it benefited from having this legal protection, and we would \nextend that to the newly constituted FEMA.\n  This protection will help achieve congressional intent that DHS be \nthe focus for comprehensive, all-hazards Federal preparation and \nresponse to disasters.\n  When the Hart-Rudman Commission on National Security in the 21st \nCentury memorandum recommended just 5 years ago a new approach to \nhomeland security and that America establish a single department to \nplan, coordinate, and integrate homeland security operations, it called \nFEMA the necessary core of that new department. To that end, USEMA, \nlike FEMA, needs to be a part of the DHS structure. That analysis has \nbeen confirmed by experience.\n  Admiral Allen of the Coast Guard explained at one of our hearings \nthat having FEMA and the Coast Guard in the same department leads to \ncertain synergies that do not otherwise occur, and that led in \nparticular to a 350-percent increase in joint training exercises. That \nis the kind of integration that we need more of.\n  More generally, keeping key capabilities within a single DHS umbrella \npermits faster communication and response than a more formal and \nbureaucratic procedure required for interdepartmental requests from a \nsetting within DHS. However, FEMA needs to have far better lines of \ncommunication.\n  I know the Presiding Officer was as shocked as I was to hear the \nformer head of FEMA, Michael Brown, talk about circumventing the chain \nof command within the Department and his failure to order critical \ncommodities, to order the buses, to communicate just how dire the \nsituation was in Louisiana.\n  We want to make sure that we improve those lines of communication, \nboth within the Department and between the Department and the White \nHouse and other agencies. That means giving the administrator more \nstatus.\n  We would upgrade the administrator so he is the equivalent of a \nDeputy Secretary. That gives him more clout and more stature in \ndealing, for example, with the Department of Defense and other \ndepartments that play important roles in responding to a disaster.\n  We designate the administrator of USEMA the principal adviser to the \nPresident on matters of emergency management. And we adopt a system \nthat for the Pentagon has worked well in outlining the reporting \nresponsibilities. We parallel the relationship between the Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff to the President. So there is both a \nreporting relationship to the Secretary of Homeland Security, and yet \nthe new administrator would be the principal adviser to the President \non emergency management.\n  In addition--I think this also responds to a key weakness that our \nintensive investigation revealed--the administrator would be authorized \nto give recommendations directly to Congress. The administration would \nhave to make sure he informs the Secretary of what he is going to say, \nbut there is a direct link, a direct line of communication.\n\n[[Page S7311]]\n\n  I know the Presiding Officer recalls that Michael Brown claims he was \nstifled in reporting to Congress. We don't know for a fact whether that \nis an accurate statement. But we put in reforms to ensure that the \nadministrator has the ability to communicate his recommendations, his \nneeds, his findings directly to Congress.\n  Our amendment, as I indicated, specifically rejects the notion that \nFEMA should be cut off of DHS and made a freestanding agency. The DHS \nneeds FEMA's capability. What would happen if FEMA, a weak FEMA, were \ncast alone is that DHS would have to recreate many of the capabilities \nthat FEMA has at great cost, at great duplication of effort. What we \nwould end up having is one agency that deals with natural disasters and \nanother agency within DHS that deals solely with disasters resulting \nfrom terrorist attacks. That makes no sense whatsoever.\n  Many of the challenges in the aftermath of a catastrophe, whether it \nis manmade or natural, are exactly the same--sheltering people, getting \nthem food and water, an evacuation plan.\n  It also makes no sense from the perspective of State and local \ngovernments. We don't want them to just deal with one agency if they \nare planning for a natural disaster and another agency if they are \nplanning for a terrorist attack since many of the challenges are \nidentical. Just think, if the levees had been blown up by terrorists \nrather than breached by Hurricane Katrina, many of the challenges would \nhave been exactly the same. There just would have been a stronger law \nenforcement component.\n\n  It is a mistake, in that the Coast Guard's stellar performance proves \nit is a mistake, to think the location of FEMA is the cause of the \nproblems. Even if that duplication were cost free, a virtual \nimpossibility, the Secretary of the Department estimates it would cost \nbillions of dollars to duplicate the necessary capabilities within DHS \nif FEMA were separated. Even if that were possibly cost free, it would \nbe destructive. Divided preparation and response systems would force \nState and local officials to have to engage one to prepare for natural \ndisasters and another for terror attacks.\n  As one of our committee's expert witnesses, Professor Donald Kettl of \nthe University of Pennsylvania, said: Separating response to terrorism \nfrom response to natural disasters, separating preparedness from \nresponse, separating FEMA from DHS, would inevitably bring problems.\n  I agree with the professor. This is consistently what we hear from \nthose who are on the front lines, from those who know what it takes to \nrespond to a catastrophe.\n  In that regard, I note that there is extraordinarily strong support \nfrom first responder groups for the Collins-Lieberman-Lott-Carper \namendment. It has been endorsed by the National Troopers Coalition, the \nMajor Cities Chiefs Association, the Grand Lodge of the Fraternal Order \nof Police, the National Association of Police Organizations, the \nNational Sheriffs Association, the International Association of Fire \nFighters, the International Association of Fire Chiefs, the \nCongressional Fire Services Institute, Advocates for EMS, the \nInternational Brotherhood of Police Officers, the International \nAssociation of EMT's and Paramedics.\n  This is quite a list of those who truly are on the front lines when \nit comes to responding to a disaster. I am very proud to have their \nsupport for our amendment. They recognize we have worked very hard and \nconsulted fully with them to come up with the right approach.\n  I also note the amendment we are offering has been endorsed by the \nHomeland Security and Defense Business Council. This is a council that \nprovides advice to the Secretary. It is made up of very distinguished \nmembers of the private sector. They, too, have endorsed it.\n  I ask unanimous consent these letters from first responder groups and \nfrom the Homeland Security and Defense Business Council be printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I also note planning and response \ncapabilities are already too weak in many States, as evidenced by the \nrecent DHS reviews. We don't want to splinter those efforts further by \nneedlessly multiplying their Federal points of contact. For many \nreasons, therefore, preserving those close working ties with other \nagencies within the Department, the new FEMA must stay within DHS.\n  Allow me to briefly summarize a few more of the provisions of the \nbill before yielding to my colleague from Connecticut. First, as I \nmentioned, it establishes a strong position for the administrator of \nthe new USEMA. This administrator would be nominated by the President, \nconfirmed by the Senate, and have the standing of a Deputy Secretary. \nDay by day, the administrator would report to the DHS Secretary, but \nthe bill explicitly provides that direct line of communication to the \nPresident as well as the authority to make recommendations to Congress \non which I have already elaborated.\n  The amendment provides for two directors. There was an issue on which \nwe worked very closely with DHS. The language we have incorporates the \nfeedback we got from the Department. Both of these individuals--which, \nagain, would be high-level individuals within the Department--would be \nnominated by the President, confirmed by the Senate, and would provide \nthe administrator and the Department with highly qualified \nprofessionals in preparedness and mitigation and in response and \nrecovery.\n  Our amendment would give the administrator responsibility for \nmanaging preparedness grant programs. The Presiding Officer knows, as \nthe former mayor, that i you control some of the money that goes out to \nState and local governments, if you are helping to allocate that \nfunding, you will have a good relationship with State and local \ngovernments. Inevitably, the authority follows the money. This is going \nto ensure we have far better coordination. This is an important \nrestoration of authority to this agency. It was a mistake, in my view, \nthat authority was taken away from FEMA. That will help ensure better \noversight and coordination of preparedness at all levels of government.\n\n  I have talked about how important I think these regional structures \nare for the new agency. It will ensure that Federal officials are \nfamiliar with the people, the vulnerabilities, the capabilities, and \nthe resources of the regions they protect, and they won't be \nintroducing themselves to strangers on unfamiliar ground when disaster \nstrikes.\n  I could not help but be struck during our hearings by the fact that \nso many individuals from FEMA were sent from region 1e--the region that \nthe Senator from Connecticut and I represent, New England--down to New \nOrleans. I like to believe we New Englanders can handle anything, but \nthe fact is, the response would be far more effective if we had people \nwho are in the area who worked every day with the emergency management \nofficials in the area, who understood the weaknesses and the strengths \nof particular States rather than sending someone from the Northeast \ndown to the hurricane region or vice versa in times of an ice storm or \nsome other disaster.\n  Further recognizing the importance of multilevel governmental \ncoordination, the bill creates a national advisory council on emergency \npreparedness and response that would be made up of State and local \nofficials, emergency management professionals from the public, private, \nand NGO sectors to advise the administrator of USEMA. This is \nimportant. We know the critical role nonprofits and the Red Cross play. \nThey, too, should be involved in the training, the planning, the \nexercising. We learned from our investigation that, too, was flawed. \nThis will help ensure the agency's thinking does not proceed in a \nstovepipe, but is fortified with comments and expertise from a wide \nrange of vitally concerned partners.\n  Our amendment addresses the glaring and urgent needs highlighted in \nour investigation of Hurricane Katrina. As I mentioned, I am very \npleased we have the support of so many experts. Nothing could speak \nmore eloquently of the need for reform or be more encouraging than to \nreceive the words of support from those who do put their lives on the \nline every day to protect the American people. We also have the support \nof the administration for this proposal.\n\n[[Page S7312]]\n\n  Amending the Homeland Security appropriations bill by adding the \nprovisions of our USEMA bill will go far to ensuring in a timely way \nthat we will have a far more effective structure to protect our fellow \ncitizens' lives and livelihoods from disaster.\n  I am very pleased this is a bipartisan effort. I recognize the work \nof the Senator from Connecticut who has led, with me, the investigation \nof the committee and the drafting of this legislation. We are also \ngrateful for the input of Senator Lott who knows better than any of \nus--except his fellow Senators from Mississippi and Louisiana--the \ndevastation of Hurricane Katrina. I am grateful for his input, as well \nas the input from Senator Carper who also has worked very hard on this \nissue.\n  Finally, I recognize all of the participation of the Presiding \nOfficer, Senator Coleman. There was no more loyal committee member who \ncame to virtually every single hearing, participated actively, and \ncontributed greatly to our investigation. I thank him for his work, as \nwell\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                    July 11, 2006.\n     Hon.

On behalf of the private \n     sector, the Council is pleased to endorse this measure to \n     reinvent, protect, and strengthen FEMA. The new FEMA, \n     reconstituted as the U.S. Emergency Management Authority, \n     would ensure that the nation will be better prepared to \n     address, either, natural or man-made disasters.\n       The Council is a non-partisan, non-profit 501 C6 \n     organization that comprises the major companies that serve \n     the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Our focus is to \n     align private sector resources to support the mission of the \n     Department on behalf of the nation's interests. The Council \n     is pleased to see language that elevates the importance of \n     FEMA within DHS and reunites preparedness functions with \n     response capabilities.\n       The Council supports provisions of S. 3595 that would:\n        Give the new U.S. Emergency Management Authority statutory \n     protection against actions that could diminish its \n     capabilities and effectiveness;\n        Ensure that the Administrator of US-EMA has direct access \n     to the President and serves as Principal Emergency Management \n     Advisor, at all times;\n       Reunite preparedness functions with response capabilities \n     to reestablish the agency's comprehensive responsibilities \n     and restore the full range of working relationships with \n     state and local government; and\n       Strengthen the Authority's regional focus with federal \n     strike teams for a faster and more coordinated response and \n     to provide better familiarity with the states in which the \n     strike teams will operate.\n       Thank you for your continued commitment to improving \n     emergency management and response and for engaging the \n     private sector to leverage industry best practices.

Susan M. Collins,\n     Chair, Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the 40,000 state \n     troopers and highway patrol men and women represented by the \n     National Troopers Coalition (NTC), we are writing to commend \n     you for your legislative efforts to ensure that law \n     enforcement is directly involved in the continuing efforts to \n     prevent and respond to acts of terrorism.\n       As an organization, NTC joins with our colleagues in other \n     national law enforcement organizations in support S. 3595, \n     the United States Emergency Management Authority Act of 2006. \n     We are convinced that retaining the Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency within the Department of Homeland Security \n     will provide better coordination among all agencies serving \n     as first responders to both natural disasters and terrorist \n     attacks, Recent history has demonstrated the importance of \n     the law enforcement community responding promptly, along with \n     others, to both terrorism and natural disasters for the \n     safety and well-being of our citizens.\n       The NTC thanks you for your leadership on this issuc and \n     your continued efforts to ensure the public that we will have \n     the authority and resources to meet our public safety \n     responsibilities under any and all circumstances.\n           Sincerely,\n     Casey Perry.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      International Association of\n\n\n                                                  Fire Chiefs,\n\n                                       Fairfax, VA, July 13, 2006.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and \n         Governmental Affairs, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Collins: On behalf of the nearly 13,000 chief \n     fire and emergency officers of the International Association \n     of Fire Chiefs (IAFC), I would like to endorse your amendment \n     to establish a U.S. Emergency Management Authority (USEMA). \n     We believe that this amendment will resolve many of the \n     problems with the nation's emergency management system by \n     improving the structure and granting greater autonomy to the \n     federal preparedness and response activities within the \n     Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\n       We believe that your approach is the best way to reform the \n     nation's emergency preparedness and response system, because \n     it keeps these activities within DHS. The IAFC is concerned \n     that the removal of the Federal Emergency Management Agency \n     (FEMA) from DHS will splinter the federal government's \n     emergency preparedness and response efforts, which will force \n     local jurisdictions to cope with competing directives from \n     both an independent FEMA and the other DHS agencies. In \n     addition, it is important that the FEMA stay within DHS and \n     continue developing relationships with the U.S. Coast Guard \n     and the other DHS components to better leverage their \n     collective assets.\n       We believe that the U.S. Emergency Management Agency \n     established by your amendment would ensure more autonomy for \n     the federal emergency preparedness and response activities. \n     The USEMA Administrator would report directly to the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security and the directors of \n     Preparedness and Response and Recovery divisions would be \n     Senate-confirmed. Your amendment also would insulate the \n     USEMA from reorganization and diversion of assets, functions, \n     or missions. The IAFC believes that USEMA's independence \n     could be further guaranteed by ensuring that the USEMA \n     Administrator would report directly to the President during a \n     Stafford Act--defined ``emergency'' or ``major disaster'' to \n     ensure that all federal assets are available without delay. \n     We greatly appreciate the provisions in this amendment that \n     ensure that the U.S. Fire Administrator remains at a level \n     equivalent to an Assistant Secretary in the department.\n       We thank you for your continued leadership on behalf of \n     America's fire service. Please feel to contact Ken LaSala, \n     Director of Government Relations, at (703) 273-9815 x347, if \n     we can be of assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Garry L.

Susan M. Collins,\n     Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \n         Affairs,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.\n     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security and \n         Governmental Affairs,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Collins and Senator Lieberman, I am writing \n     on behalf of the members of the Fraternal Order of Police to \n     advise you of our strong opposition to any legislation or \n     amendment that would remove the Federal Emergency Management \n     Agency (FEMA) from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security \n     (DHS).\n       Since the terrorist attacks on the United States in \n     September 2001, our nation has worked diligently to defend \n     itself from future attacks and, in so doing, have also \n     dedicated significant resources to respond to large scale \n     critical incidents, both natural and man-made. Yet the \n     primary mission of the Department of Homeland Security must \n     always be the prevention of future attacks against the United \n     States, and this mission is best entrusted to law enforcement \n     at the local, State, and Federal levels.\n       However, our nation will face natural disasters which \n     cannot be prevented, and, for these, we must be prepared to \n     respond. Law enforcement is a critical component of this \n     response and law. enforcement at every level of government \n     seeks to increase the speed and effectiveness of delivering \n     emergency services to those in need. Clearly, the mass \n     devastation brought to the Gulf Coast by Hurricane Katrina \n     showed that greater coordination and communication is needed \n     to respond to incidents of such magnitude. This goal cannot \n     and will not be achieved if FEMA is removed from DHS. Indeed, \n     the F.O.P. believes that such a move would reduce our \n     nation's overall level of preparedness.\n       The F.O.P. also strongly supports greater participation of \n     law enforcement in planning emergency response at every level \n     of government. We will continue our review of various \n     legislative proposals addressing the need for emergency \n     management reform at the Federal level. I thank you both in \n     advance for your consideration of the positions we have laid \n     out to date and look forward to working with you to improve \n     our nation's ability to prevent terrorist attacks and prepare \n     for future critical incidents.

S. 3595, the United States Emergency \n     Management Authority Act, is a step in the right direction; \n     making DHS more efficient with limited disruption and \n     reorganization.\n       Prevention is the best investment in response capability. \n     Like the President, we believe that the best way to respond \n     to a terrorist attack, be it biological, chemical, \n     radiological, nuclear or conventional explosive is to prevent \n     it from happening in the first place. Intelligence, \n     investigation, and preparedness are all law enforcement \n     functions that will help prevent terrorists from striking \n     again.\n       As you know, we feel strongly that preparedness and \n     prevention are too dissimilar from response and recovery for \n     these functions to operate under the same common chain of \n     command. That is why we welcome the creation of a separate \n     and distinct Office of the Prevention of Terrorism reporting \n     directly to the Secretary. This structure will not permit the \n     dilution of the prevention mission under layers of \n     bureaucracy. We are also pleased that the bill does not break \n     apart the Preparedness Directorate keeping it on equal \n     footing with response and recovery. We strongly support the \n     Preparedness Directorate and its vital role at DHS.\n       We look forward to working with you and supporting your \n     efforts to ensure that DHS has a clear prevention mission. If \n     we can be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to \n     call on Tom Frazier at 410-433-8909.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Harold Hurtt,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                   Police Organizations, Inc.,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 11, 2006.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,\n     Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairwoman Collins and Ranking Member Lieberman: On \n     behalf of the National Association of Police Organizations \n     (NAPO) representing more than 238,000 law enforcement \n     officers throughout the United States, I would like to thank \n     you for introducing S. 3595, the ``United States Emergency \n     Management Authorization Act of 2006,'' and advise you of our \n     support, particularly in regards to Section 517 of the \n     legislation. If enacted, this bill will establish within the \n     Department of Homeland Security (DHS) an Office for the \n     Prevention of Terrorism.\n       The ``United States Emergency Management Authorization Act \n     of 2006'' will create an Office that would be responsible for \n     coordinating anti-terrorism policy and operations between DHS \n     and state and local law enforcement. The Director of the \n     Office for the Prevention of Terrorism would have the \n     important task of developing better intelligence sharing \n     methods between DHS and state and local law enforcement \n     agencies. This new Office would also ensure that vital \n     homeland security grants are adequately focused on terrorism.\n       This legislation recognizes the importance of standardized \n     coordination and communication between the country's local, \n     state, and federal law enforcement in preventing acts of \n     terrorism within the United States. Section 517 of the \n     ``United States Emergency Management Authorization Act of \n     2006'' will help ensure that state and local law enforcement \n     are properly supported, trained and informed in order to \n     prevent terrorism before it occurs.\n       NAPO thanks you for your continued support of law \n     enforcement and I look forward to working with you to get \n     this important legislation passed. If you have any questions, \n     please feel free to contact me, or NAPO's Legislative \n     Assistant, Andrea Mournighan, at (202) 842-4420.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William J. Johnson,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                            Advocates for EMS,\n\n                                                    July 11, 2006.\n     Sen. Susan Collins,\n     Chair, Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs \n         Committee, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: Advocates for EMS, a not-for-profit \n     organization founded to educate elected and appointed \n     officials and the public on important issues affecting EMS \n     providers, writes in support of S. 3595, the United States \n     Emergency Management Authority Act of 2006. The measure \n     establishes the U.S. Emergency Management Authority (USEMA) \n     and creates a more autonomous agency within DHS, similar to \n     the U.S. Coast Guard. S. 3595 also retains the Federal \n     Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) within the Department of \n     Homeland Security (DHS).\n       Advocates believes that moving FEMA out of DHS would only \n     continue the instability that FEMA has experienced since its \n     move to DHS. While FEMA responsibilities include natural \n     disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes and floods; it should \n     also have an integrated response plan for other emerging \n     threats. Removing FEMA from DHS would only add additional \n     hurdles for EMS providers in terms of their ability to work \n     with the federal government in response to a natural or man-\n     made event.\n       Creating a U.S. Emergency Management Authority (USEMA) and \n     the autonomy provided by the legislation is a step forward in \n     making FEMA efficient and effective in providing emergency \n     medical services responders the leadership and resources they \n     need. In addition, Advocates also supports the establishment \n     of the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) and its responsibilities \n     the legislation provides. The CMO plays a key role in \n     coordinating medical response within DHS and other federal \n     agencies.\n       Advocates thanks you for your continued leadership on this \n     issue and looks forward to working with you in the future on \n     first responder issues.\n           Sincerely,\n     Advocates for EMS.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         International Association\n\n\n                                             of Fire Fighters,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 11, 2006.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     Hon. Joe Lieberman,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Collins and Lieberman: On behalf of the \n     nation's more than 270,000 professional fire fighters and \n     emergency medical personnel, I applaud you for your efforts \n     to reform the nation's emergency preparedness and response \n     system. We strongly support the enactment of legislation to \n     reform FEMA within the Department of Homeland Security and \n     appreciate your continued leadership in moving this effort \n     forward.\n       Congress must enact comprehensive reforms to ensure that \n     FEMA will be able to provide an effective response to \n     disasters. These reforms, such as reuniting disaster \n     preparedness and response functions within FEMA and utilizing \n     an all-hazards approach to emergency preparedness, can and \n     should be made within the Department of Homeland Security.\n       We believe that proposals to return FEMA to its status as \n     an independent agency would hinder efforts to reform our \n     nation's emergency response system. Removing FEMA from DHS \n     would create competing agencies, sowing confusion among \n     emergency responders. Furthermore, such an approach would \n     undermine an all-hazards approach, leading to a perception \n     that DHS deals with terrorism, while FEMA is in charge of \n     natural disasters.\n       When Congress created the Department of Homeland Security, \n     it did so with the understanding that emergency preparedness \n     and response are at the core of our nation's homeland \n     security. Your amendment to the Homeland Security \n     Appropriations Act helps to fulfill this mandate by ensuring \n     that FEMA remain an integral part of the Department of \n     Homeland Security.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this vital issue. We \n     greatly appreciate your continued support for the nation's \n     front-line emergency responders and look forward to working \n     with you in the coming weeks to improve the way our nation \n     responds to disasters.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Barry Kasinitz,\n     Director, Governmental Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                Congressional Fire\n\n\n                                           Services Institute,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 10, 2006.\n     Hon. Susan Collins, Chair,\n     Hon. Joe Lieberman, Ranking Member,\n     Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \n         Affairs, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Collins and Lieberman: The response to \n     Hurricane Katrina revealed a number of things regarding our \n     nation's level of readiness for major disasters. On the one \n     hand, it showed the courage and dedication of local first \n     responders--our firefighters, law enforcement, and rescue \n     personnel--who made many sacrifices of their own in order to \n     respond valiantly to the greatest natural disaster in our \n     nation's history. On the other hand, it exposed the \n     limitations of our national response capabilities, \n     exacerbated by failures in leadership at all levels of \n     government.\n       While there is no doubt fundamental changes need to be made \n     to our national response structure, we are greatly concerned \n     by recent efforts in the Congress to remove FEMA from the \n     Department of Homeland Security. The separation would \n     diminish the resources of both FEMA and DHS, and create a \n     duplication of critical components resulting in a \n     bureaucratic nightmare for first responders and local \n     governments.\n       In 2002, we were one of nine organizations that signed on \n     to a white paper outlining our position on the creation of \n     the Department of Homeland Security. The first recommendation \n     was that FEMA ``be at the core of the Department of Homeland \n     Security.'' Our organization has not altered its position. \n     FEMA can succeed but it will require strong leadership, \n     proper resources, and better execution of the roles and \n     responsibilities by FEMA and its partners. Your legislation, \n     S. 3595, takes into account our\n\n[[Page S7314]]\n\n     recommendation. We commend you for addressing this issue and \n     appreciate your support.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this issue. We certainly \n     look forward to continuing our work with your committee to \n     address the needs and challenges of our nation's first \n     responders.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  William M. Webb,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Chairman Collins, \nfor an excellent introductory statement and to say, once again, how \nmuch I am honored and pleased to work with her as the ranking Democrat \non our homeland security committee, and how pleased I am to join with \nher today and with Senators Carper and Lott to introduce this amendment \nto make FEMA into an agency capable of responding swiftly and \neffectively to the most serious disasters, whether a hurricane the size \nand scope of Katrina, a natural disaster the likes of which we see more \nroutinely, or a terrorist attack which, of course, our enemies hope \nwill be even more devastating than the attacks of September 11 and for \nwhich we must be perpetually on the defensive and prepared.\n  This amendment would literally reinvent FEMA to give our Federal \nemergency preparedness and response experts the authority, the \ncapabilities, the resources, and the integration with State and local \nofficials needed to avoid the confused, uncoordinated, and ultimately \nineffective response that the Nation and the world witnessed last \nAugust when Katrina made landfall. It would strengthen emergency \npreparedness and response within the Homeland Security Department which \nthis Congress created a short time ago to prevent, prepare for, and \nultimately respond to all kinds of disasters.\n  In doing so, this amendment would create a truly national system of \nemergency management that will be able to draw on the Nation's vast \nresources for a cohesive and complete local, State, and Federal \nresponse.\n  Mr. President, the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee spent 7 months in 2005 and 2006 investigating the botched \nGovernment response to that catastrophic hurricane. We found all levels \nof our Government were ill-equipped to deal with the massive human \nsuffering all along the gulf coast that followed that terrible storm's \nlandfall, suffering that shocked, angered, and embarrassed the American \npeople who expect more support from their Government for fellow \nAmericans in need.\n  These failings were caused by negligence in some cases, by a lack of \nresources in other cases, by a lack of capabilities in some cases, but \nmost of all by a lack of leadership and preparation that comes with \nleadership from the very top to the very bottom.\n  We cannot legislate leadership, although as Senator Collins said, we \ncan at least require the kind of experience in the people who will lead \nAmerica's emergency management effort that would make it more likely \nthey would be leaders, and we can legislate changes in Government \nstructures to make them more sensible and better suited to protect \npeople in times of disaster.\n  The homeland security committee's report had merit because we told \nthe story of what happened and didn't happen, of the clear warnings \nthat such a hurricane would one day strike the gulf coast, and the \nclear predictions that we were not ready. In telling the story, right \nthrough the weekend before landfall and then the days following the \ndisaster itself, I believe the committee, on a truly bipartisan basis, \nmade a contribution. Because sometimes just telling the truth and \nputting it before those in positions of responsibility is one of the \ngreat curatives, one of the great sources of reform. But the committee \nwent beyond just telling the story and offered a number of \nrecommendations about what was needed to improve our preparations, \nresponse, and recovery.\n\n  Chairman Collins and I will soon introduce broader legislation to \nencompass all of our committee report's recommendations. These include \nchanges to the Stafford Act to address the different kinds of \nassistance that are needed in response to catastrophic events rather \nthan ``ordinary'' disasters; provisions to ensure that communications \nsystems can work--and that first responders can talk to each other--\neven in devastating disasters; requirements for the national planning \nfor disasters and catastrophes that FEMA was never able to fully \naccomplish; and steps to ensure that USEMA has the kind of robust and \ncapable workforce it needs to success. All of these are crucial pieces \nof the effort to remake our nations emergency response and recovery \ncapabilities.\n  But we begin today with the foundation, the most important \nrecommendation we made, which is to rejoin the functions of disaster \nresponse with disaster preparedness within a new agency, a reinvented \nFEMA, which we will call USEMA, the U.S. Emergency Management \nAuthority. It would be at the very core of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, just as FEMA was originally intended to be when we proposed \nthe new department in 2002 based on the recommendations of the Hart-\nRudman Commission the previous year.\n  How could one have a Department of Homeland Security, which is aimed \nat preparing for and responding to disasters, including terrorist \nattacks, without the Federal agency that is primarily responsible for \nemergency management? It makes no sense. Our investigation of what went \nwrong during Hurricane Katrina made it clear that part of the problem \nwas caused by separate and uncoordinated Federal preparedness and \nresponse functions within the Department of Homeland Security.\n  In the years before Katrina, FEMA, the agency charged with \ncoordinating our Nation's response to terrorist attacks and natural \ndisasters, too often was out of the loop when critical decisions about \nhow to prepare were being made. It had no say in how to spend billions \nof dollars in preparedness grants. Training exercises were designed and \nheld without serious input by FEMA. Relationships with State and local \nofficials on the front lines were not fully developed and sometimes \nwere nonexistent. So FEMA's ability to respond was crippled because it \nwas not working hand in glove with those making preparations for \nresponding to disaster.\n  Our amendment, first and foremost, therefore, will ensure that our \npreparedness efforts are inseparable from the capabilities needed to \nrespond. As Chairman Collins has said, preparation and response are two \nsides of the same coin. And the coin, which is the coin of America's \nemergency management in times of disaster, is stronger if those two \nsides are together.\n  USEMA will provide the resources and it will have the ability and the \nresponsibility to plan and train with State and local emergency \nmanagement officials, just as it will have the responsibility to \ncoordinate with them at the time of a disaster.\n  Where FEMA has often struggled to cope with normal hurricanes, the \nmission of the new Authority will be to partner with State and local \ngovernments, other Federal agencies, the private sector, and \nnongovernmental organizations to build a national system of emergency \nmanagement that can respond effectively to catastrophic incident.\n  Where FEMA has been slow to respond and too often reactive, the new \nAuthority will be charged with developing a Federal response capability \nthat can and will act rapidly and proactively when necessary to deliver \nassistance essential to saving lives in a disaster.\n  Where FEMA has not been fully integrated with DHS, the Department of \nHomeland Security, the new Authority will be charged with coordinating \nwith key agencies in the Department also involved in emergency \nmanagement, also on the front lines at a time of disaster, such as the \nCoast Guard.\n  Our amendment would also give the new Authority special status within \nthe Department--the same status the Coast Guard and the Secret Service \nnow have. With that status, changes to the agency's functions and its \nassets could only be made by congressional statute, not by executive \naction. That is a way of protecting the strength we intend to give this \nnew authority.\n  We would also insist in this legislation that the administrator and \nother key agency officials have the necessary experience and \nqualifications for the job. In other words, USEMA will not be plagued \nby unqualified appointees, as FEMA has been in the past.\n\n[[Page S7315]]\n\n  Chairman Collins and I also envision a new agency with robust \nregional offices which would focus on coordination of preparedness and \nresponse with local and State agencies. Let's take the focus away from \nWashington and place it where it belongs, where the real work of \npreparedness is done, on the front lines, in the States and in the \nmunicipalities. This will guarantee that Federal officials are familiar \nwith regional and local threats and know their counterparts at the \nState and local levels. Different parts of the country face different \nnatural disaster prospects. Unfortunately, most every part of the \ncountry is vulnerable today to terrorist attack. This regional approach \nwill help ensure that officials are not exchanging business cards on \nthe day the disaster strikes, that the local, State, and Federal \nofficials are not meeting on the day or the day before the disaster or \nthe day after the disaster.\n  I know some of my colleagues in the Senate believe FEMA should be \nremoved from the Department of Homeland Security and given independent \nstatus. Bu Senator Collins and I, after our extensive investigation, \nhave concluded that is not the solution to the problems we saw in \nresponse to Hurricane Katrina, but instead would compound the problems. \nIt would be a serious mistake to separate FEMA out of the Department. \nEven when it was independent, FEMA never developed the capacity to \nrespond to a catastrophe like Hurricane Katrina. So returning it to \nindependent status, as if those were the golden days of yore, is not \nbased on fact, and it will in no way solve the problems we saw in \nresponse to Katrina and that we face today. In fact, it will make \nsolutions and, I would say, preparations and responses to disaster far \nmore difficult.\n\n  Removing the agency from the Department would only create additional \nproblems, duplications, and disconnectedness. The Department of \nHomeland Security, containing other emergency response agencies, such \nas the Coast Guard, and other components, would begin to rebuild the \nfunctions of FEMA in the Department, even though it was independent. \nFEMA--independent, out of the Department--would duplicate activities \nand functions that are in the Department resulting in a waste of money, \nbureaucratic inefficiencies and a lack of coordination that would not \nonly put us at risk of repeating the inadequate response we saw to \nHurricane Katrina last year but of making it even worse.\n  To cope with a catastrophe, the Government's chief preparations and \nresponse agency must have access to the vast resources of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, and it needs to work seamlessly with \nother agencies that have critical roles to play during a catastrophe. \nThose working relationships are going to be much easier and more real \nif officials know one another and if agencies have a history with each \nother and, of course, if everyone ultimately serves the same Secretary \nof Homeland Security.\n  The grievous conditions of gulf coast communities in the week after \nKatrina's landfall embarrassed us before the world and, quite \nappropriately, angered us because we know that America can do better. \nBut the gulf coast and the force of Katrina are not isolated examples. \nOther American communities and regions are similarly vulnerable today--\nwhether to a natural disaster or terrorist attack. We also know \nsignificant flaws in the Nation's readiness remain. Another response \nlike the one we saw during Katrina is simply not an option.\n  Our proposal is not about rearranging bureaucratic boxes. We have \nstudied past failings and carefully considered how to improve our \nperformance, the Federal Government performance, the next time. We have \nbeen driven by that singular goal. We have not had any thoughts in mind \nof protecting the status quo or favoring one bureaucratic entity over \nanother. We have tried to come up with a recommendation that will put \nAmerica's Government in the best position to protect America's people \nthe next time disaster strikes. We are driven by the imperative to save \npeople's lives, like the lives lost during Hurricane Katrina.\n  The changes embodied in this amendment, I am convinced, promise a \nstrong response, if enacted, the next time disaster strikes. So I ask \nmy colleagues for their support of this amendment.\n  I thank Senator Collins for her leadership and express once again my \npleasure at the opportunity to work with her and in this instance to be \njoined by Senator Lott and Senator Carper in a truly bipartisan \nnational-interest homeland security amendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \nraised by Senator Akaka on behalf of Senator Clinton, and in opposition \nto the amendment offered by Senator Collins.\n  Mr. President, colleagues, what we are seeing today with the \nunderlying amendment is a refusal to admit that a mistake was made when \nFEMA was incorporated into the Department of Homeland Security when it \nwas created in 2002 after September 11.\n  Rather than correct the mistake, extract FEMA from DHS, and restore \nit to its former state as an independent agency reporting directly to \nthe President, the Collins amendment makes an effort to change the way \nFEMA operates within the Department. I support Senator Clinton's \nsecond-degree amendment to restore FEMA to an independent, Cabinet-\nlevel agency, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Over the last 200 years, we have moved from an ad hoc approach to \ndisaster response to a coordinated, orderly approach, authorized by the \nStafford Act, over which my Committee, the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, holds jurisdiction.\n  On September 11, the Nation was struck by a terrorist attack. The \neffectiveness of FEMA helped reduce the impact of those events.\n  In what I believe is an example of extremely poor judgment that \nfailed to take into account FEMA's role in responding to natural \ndisasters, FEMA was moved into the Department of Homeland Security.\n  FEMA has shown itself to be ineffective, in my opinion, largely due \nto the bureaucracy of the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA's \nlack of independence. At the time of the creation of DHS, I said:\n\n       I cannot understand why, after years of frustration and \n     failure, we would jeopardize the Federal government's \n     effective response to natural disasters by dissolving FEMA \n     into this monolithic Homeland Security Department. I fear \n     that FEMA will no longer be able to adequately respond to \n     hurricanes, fires, floods, and earthquakes, begging the \n     question, who will? (November 20, 2002)\n\n  Today, unfortunately, we know the answer--no one.\n  With Hurricane Katrina, I believe that we witnessed the degradation \nof our national response system as a result of that change. We all \nwatched the results of that free-fall on live television. As I watched \nthe coverage of that event, I could only think of the unnecessary human \nsuffering that was occurring, in part as a result of the bad decision \nmade by Congress to include FEMA in DHS.\n  Today we have a chance to correct our mistake.\n  It is the very structure of the Department that makes it impossible \nfor FEMA to be effective. In a disaster, regardless of cause, decisions \nneed to be made quickly and resources need to be brought to bear \nimmediately. FEMA reporting directly to the President is the only way \nto make this happen. During Katrina, we saw the result of having our \nemergency response agency buried in the bureaucracy of DHS--executive \ndecisionmakers were isolated from the realities of the situation, \npreventing the quick, effective action that we saw after September 11. \nThe only way to correct that problem is to get FEMA out of DHS and into \na Cabinet-level status, reporting directly to the President.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Clinton amendment and reject the \nCollins amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my entire statement from 2002 be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Floor Statement of Senator Jim Jeffords, Homeland Security, November \n                               20, 2002.\n\n       Mark Twain once said, ``Always do right--this will gratify \n     some people and astonish the rest.'' I rise today to explain \n     why I believe voting against this bill is the right thing to \n     do.\n       Of the many reasons to vote against the bill, I will focus \n     on three--the bill's treatment of the Federal Emergency \n     Management\n\n[[Page S7316]]\n\n     Agency, the bill's treatment of the Freedom of Information \n     Act, and the process used to create this new Department.\n       With the passage of this Homeland Security legislation, we \n     will destroy the Federal Emergency Management Agency, losing \n     year's of progress toward a well-coordinated Federal response \n     to disasters.\n       As it now exists, FEMA is a lean, flexible agency receiving \n     bipartisan praise as one of the most effective agencies in \n     government. But it hasn't always been that way.\n       Throughout the 1980s, FEMA's focus on Cold War's nuclear \n     threat left the Agency ill-prepared to respond to natural \n     disasters. The Congressional chorus of critics decried the \n     Agency's misguided focus and reached a crescendo after \n     bungled responses to Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and Hurricane \n     Andrew in 1992.\n       One of FEMA's leading Congressional critics, then-\n     Representative Tom Ridge said in 1988, ``I was convinced that \n     somewhere along the way, the Federal Emergency Management \n     Agency had lost its sense of mission.''\n       Over the last decade, refocusing the agency's mission and \n     priorities on natural disasters has left the agency well-\n     equipped to respond to all types of disasters. FEMA's stellar \n     response to September 11th proved this.\n       I cannot understand why, after years of frustration and \n     failure, we would jeopardize the Federal government's \n     effective response to natural disasters by dissolving FEMA \n     into this monolithic Homeland Security Department.\n       I fear that FEMA will no longer be able to adequately \n     respond to hurricanes, fires, floods, and earthquakes, \n     begging the question, who will?\n       Mr. President, also of great concern to me are the new \n     Freedom of Information Act exemptions contained in the latest \n     substitute.\n       Unfortunately, the current Homeland Security proposal \n     chokes the public's access to information under the Freedom \n     of Information Act. I ask, are we headed toward an Orwellian \n     society with an all-knowing, secretive big brother reigning \n     over an unknowing public?\n       The bill defines information so broadly that almost \n     anything disclosed by a company to the Department of Homeland \n     Security could be considered secret and kept from the public.\n       Although I believe current law contains an adequate \n     national security exemption, in the spirit of compromise, I \n     supported the carefully crafted bi-partisan Senate language \n     contained in both the Lieberman substitute and the Gramm-\n     Miller substitute. The current bill ignores this compromise.\n       Mr. President, the process by which we received this \n     substitute seems eerily similar to the way the White House \n     sprung its original proposal on the Congress some time ago.\n       Late last week we received a bill that had magically grown \n     from an original 35 pages to an unwieldy 484 pages. There was \n     no compromise in arriving at the current substitute, only a \n     mandate to pass the substitute or be branded as weak on \n     homeland security or worse yet, unpatriotic.\n       Still more troubling, the current bill places little \n     emphasis on correcting what went wrong prior to September \n     11th or addressing future threats. Correcting intelligence \n     failures should be our prime concern. Instead this bill \n     recklessly reshuffles the bureaucratic deck.\n       Furthermore, as my colleague Senator Corzine stated earlier \n     this week, this bill does not address other vitally important \n     issues such as security at facilities that store or use \n     dangerous chemicals. Without provisions to address yet \n     another gaping hole in our Nation's security, why are we not \n     being more deliberate in our approach?\n       In closing Mr. President, I feel that it is irresponsible \n     to divert precious limited resources from our fight against \n     terrorism to create a dysfunctional new bureaucracy that will \n     only serve to give the American public a false sense of \n     security.\n       I will vote against this bill because it does nothing to \n     address the massive intelligence failure that led up to the \n     September 11th attacks. It dismantles the highly effective \n     Federal Emergency Management Agency and creates dangerous new \n     exemptions to the Freedom of Information Act that threaten \n     the fundamental democratic principle of a well-informed \n     citizenry.\n       Thank you.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment criminalizes the \nunauthorized construction, financing, or reckless disregard which \npermits construction of a border tunnel that is a tunnel between \nAmerican land and another country's land; namely, Canada or Mexico or \nany subterranean passageway along international borders.\n  This amendment is cosponsored by Senators Kyl, Boxer, Talent, \nCantwell, Salazar, Hutchison, and Bingaman. This amendment was part of \nthe immigration bill. It was unanimously added to the immigration bill \nby the Judiciary Committee. I have tried to hotline this amendment. It \nwas cleared on the Democratic side, and it was cleared on the \nRepublican side with the exception of one Senator. I believe it is an \nimportant amendment. That is why I am offering it today as an amendment \nto this bill.\n  Believe it or not, today the act of constructing, financing, or using \na tunnel between borders is not a Federal crime. This amendment changes \nthat. In addition to criminalizing the unauthorized construction, \nfinancing, or use of a border tunnel on one's land, this amendment also \ndoubles the criminal penalties for individuals caught using a tunnel to \nunlawfully smuggle aliens, goods, drugs, weapons of mass destruction, \nor terrorists. The amendment also allows for assets involved in the \noffense or any property traceable to the offense to be subject to \nforfeiture.\n  Finally, the amendment directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to \npromulgate or amend Federal sentencing guidelines to provide for \ncriminal penalties for persons convicted pursuant to the language of \nthe amendment and to take into account the gravity of this crime when \nconsidering base offense levels.\n  One might ask: Why is this important? I will answer that. Since \nSeptember 11, 43 tunnels and subterranean passageways into the United \nStates have been discovered--26 tunnels along the California-Mexican \nborder, 16 tunnels along the Arizona-Mexican border, and 1 tunnel along \nthe Washington-Canadian border. The risk to national security that is \nraised by the use of these tunnels is one this body is already aware \nof. In fact, the Senate Appropriations Committee included report \nlanguage on this topic, which reads:\n\n       Policy on tunnels along the border: The Committee is \n     concerned with the Department's lack of a clear policy \n     regarding which agency is responsible for securing, closing, \n     and ultimately filling tunnels which are discovered crossing \n     under our land borders. It appears decisions regarding the \n     handling of tunnels are made on an ad hoc basis, depending on \n     which agency discovers the tunnel and has the resources to \n     fill it. With nearly four dozen known tunnels along our \n     borders, it is imperative a policy regarding tunnels be \n     developed.\n\n  And it goes on. It asks that this policy be developed not later than \nFebruary 8.\n  This report language in the appropriations bill is a good first step, \nbut it is just that. The cosponsors of this amendment and I believe \nthat we send a further message that border tunnels are a problem and \nthey must be dealt with. As I mentioned, 43 border tunnels have been \ndiscovered in the United States. These tunnels range in complexity from \nsimple gopher holes a few feet long at the border to massive drug-\ncartel-built megatunnels costing hundreds of thousands of dollars to \nconstruct.\n  I recently visited a border tunnel on the Mexican-San Diego border. \nLet me tell you what I found. I found a tunnel that was extraordinarily \nsophisticated. It was six football fields long. It went under other \nbuildings. It went under the border. The American side was a large \nwarehouse, brand new, huge warehouse, half a long square block, kept \nempty, small rooms inside the warehouse. Inside one room, which I will \nshow you in a minute, was a hatch. Down the hatch was a tunnel, a \nconcrete floor, ventilation, a pump to drain it, and electricity, as we \ncan see. This was the tunnel interior.\n\n  This is a picture of the interior. We can see the concrete. At one \nend of the tunnel was 2,000 pounds of marijuana, and at the other end \nwas 300 pounds of marijuana.\n  This was the hatch in a room, and it looked very benign. You simply \nlifted up two floor tiles, and under those floor tiles, you descended \nabout 10 feet and there was this huge apparatus which clearly had been \nfunctioning for a substantial period of time. I found it just amazing.\n  The building, interestingly enough, was sold about a year ago to an \nindividual who never leased it out. I have always wondered: Why \nwouldn't you lease out a warehouse? That question still has not been \nanswered to my satisfaction.\n  I also learned there is no law against it. There is no law that says \nyou have to do due diligence on your property if it is on the border to \nsee that somebody doesn't come along and dig a tunnel such as this and \nsmuggle aliens, smuggle drugs, possibly smuggle terrorists, possibly \nsmuggle weapons. This is a way to do it. Therefore, I believe this \namendment belongs in this bill.\n  My hope, given the importance of criminalizing this action, is that \nthis amendment will be included in the managers' amendment. We will \nstill be delighted if that is the case. I am not sure that is possible. \nI believe to allow another period of time to go by with no law that \nsays it is illegal to build a border tunnel unless you are authorized \nto do so, and has some sanctions to it, is really long overdue. It \nwould be terrible if we found out one day that a group of 15 or 16 \nterrorists came in from Mexico or came in from Canada to the State of \nWashington through a border tunnel and we had done nothing about it.\n  This amendment also says that the owner of property along the border \nmust be reasonably aware, must do their due diligence to see that their \nproperty is maintained and a border tunnel is prevented.\n  I am hopeful this amendment will be accepted and, if not, I will \ncertainly ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I think the Senator's amendment is a good \namendment and I would like to accept it. There is an objection on our \nside to our accepting it at this time with which the Senator is \nfamiliar. I am hopeful we can resolve that objection.\n  Rather than going to the yeas and nays, let's see if we can resolve \nthe objection.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Would the Senator like me to hold on the yeas and \nnays?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would appreciate it if the Senator from \nCalifornia would. I certainly assure the Senator that at some point, if \nwe have to vote on it, we will vote on it. Right now there appears to \nbe an objection going forward.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Gregg. I know Senator \nKyl is going to come to the floor and speak on the amendment as well. I \ndo not see him at this time.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator has made an excellent point. It doesn't \nsurprise me there is no criminality or law involved that restricts the \nability to dig a tunnel from one country to another. It is pretty \nobvious that something\n\n[[Page S7318]]\n\nshould be done in this area. So I think the Senator has touched on a \nvery important point. hopefully we will work it out, and we will work \nit out before this bill is off the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator for those comments.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and ask that the amendment be set \naside.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: What is the pending \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment by Senator Feinstein, No. 4556.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe set aside and we return to debate on amendment No. 4560 by Senator \nCollins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator asking that it be the pending \nquestion or just to debate it?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am asking that the pending amendment be set aside to \nreturn to debate on amendment No. 4560.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4560\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I come to the floor to join in the support \nof amendment No. 4560 to the Department of Homeland Security \nappropriations bill. I thank Senator Collins for her leadership in this \narea and for her willingness to work on a solution that I think will be \ngood for the Federal Emergency Management Administration, as it is now \nknown, in the Department of Homeland Security, and result in a better \neffort by the successor to FEMA in the future.\n  Let me begin by saying that I appreciate the support of my colleagues \nin the Senate as we have gone through the aftermath of Katrina and we \nhave come to the floor three or four times asking for help in a variety \nof areas to help us with the recovery, to get funds for the different \nFederal agencies, to get funds even to the Federal Emergency Management \nAdministration to help us recover. A lot of progress has been made. I \nwant to acknowledge that.\n  In 3 years or 5 years, we are going to look back and say that the aid \nwe received from the Federal Government was absolutely indispensable \nand allowed us to get through this very difficult process.\n  In the immediate aftermath of the hurricane, there were wonderful \nstories that could be told about the actions of the Coast Guard \nspecifically, let me point out, and by other military installations, \nfaith-based groups, volunteer groups, charitable organizations, by \ncorporate America that sent aid, supplies, money, people. The utilities \nworked laboriously to get power back on and telephones operative. It \nwas a monumental undertaking.\n  For those who want to be critical of the recovery effort--and I am \none of those--you have to first acknowledge that this was a devastating \ndisaster of Biblical proportions, more than any of us could have \ncomprehended, more than any of us who lived in the line of fire from \nHurricane Katrina understood even in the immediate aftermath, including \nme.\n  I was there in the immediate aftermath. We lost our house. We are \nlike everybody else along the coastline of Mississippi and Louisiana. \nIt is a very difficult experience. But our people have been resilient, \nthey have been determined, and we are making progress.\n  We did get through the preparations for the hurricane, saving lives \nimmediately after, getting basics to people who needed them--just basic \nwater and ice. We have gotten almost all of the debris removed, except \nin some of the swamp and water canals and channels that still has to be \nremoved. We are seeing rebuilding start. Just yesterday, the Department \nof Housing and Urban Development released $3 billion for the home \ngrants through CDBG so that people who lost their home, had no \ninsurance, and had a mortgage and probably lost their job and their \ncar, their truck, or their dog will have some way to get up to $150,000 \nto get their homes repaired or rebuilt. So we have made a lot of \nprogress.\n\n  I think it is time that we look even more to the future: How are we \ngoing to get through the rebuilding period? We are working with \nelevations, heights that FEMA is requiring; we are dealing with small \nbusiness loans, all that goes on with the rebuilding effort.\n  But I am worried about the next disaster. There were some very \ndisappointing results at FEMA. And I want to hasten to say that FEMA, \nwhich became a dirty, four-letter word, has a lot of good people in it \nand has done a lot of really good things, but it could have been and it \nshould have been better. And what troubles me so much, as a Congressman \nand Senator and even before that as a staff member--I have dealt with \nthe recovery effort after five hurricanes, two major tornadoes, two \nmajor ice storms, and a flood. I have dealt with disasters. I have \ndealt with the emergency arm of the Federal Government, going back to \n1969 after Hurricane Camille, when the disaster effort and recovery was \ncarried out by the Office of Emergency Preparedness, OEP. Its offices \nare right across the street from the Old Executive Office Building, run \nby a general, a retired Army general, and reportable only to the \nPresident of the United States.\n  They did a marvelous job after Hurricane Camille. The chain of \ncommand was short. In those days, the Corps of Engineers brought in the \nheavy equipment, the trucks, the bulldozers, the front-end loaders, the \nBobcats. They cleaned up the debris. Now you have to go through \nTreasury, a check goes to FEMA, FEMA goes to the Corps, the Corps of \nEngineers goes to the contractor--out of State probably--and the \ncontractor goes to subcontractors, to sub-subcontractors and, \nmeanwhile, a lot of money is frittered away as everybody takes their \nbite, on down the line.\n  Of course, one of the most difficult things was getting the trailers, \nthe temporary housing to people in the area. The logistics of getting \ntrailers is not a big problem, but getting them to the people turned \nout to be a huge problem. The insanity of how it was managed was \ninexplicable. I won't go through how difficult it was.\n  We are still dealing with that. We still have some people who are \nliving in tents because FEMA said: We won't deliver you a trailer if \nyou are in a flood zone. If that is all the property you have--you \ncould bring a trailer into a flood zone, and if you had to, you could \nhitch it up and pull it out. But people are still living in very \ndifficult circumstances.\n  I believe we made a mistake when we were creating this huge, new, \nmammoth Department of Homeland Security where we put all of these \ndifferent entities, agencies, and bureaus into that agency that wound \nup having 150,000 or more people in it.\n  I remember when we were discussing creating this Department of \nHomeland Security in an office right down the hall. Senator Stevens and \nSenator Collins and some of us raised questions about how the Coast \nGuard was going to be handled, and we wound up carving out a special \narrangement for the Coast Guard. I won't get into the details of it at \nthis moment. But I raised questions about FEMA, too: Are we sure we \nwant to put our emergency management organization into this big, \nmammoth department and maybe become overrun by homeland security and \nterrorism? And the answer was: Oh, absolutely. They need to coordinate \nmanmade disasters, natural disasters, disaster preparation, disaster \nrecovery; it needs to be seamless and they all need to be operating \nunder the same authority.\n  Well, I relented. I think it was a mistake. I think the emergency \nmanagement organization has a unique responsibility in preparation for \ndisasters. Yes, they can be manmade as well as natural disasters, but \nalso in the recovery. But I think the chain of command was out of \ncontrol. The number of officials who were meeting in a room, they would \nfill up the room and identify all the problems: Oh, we have a flood \nmain broken here. We have schools where the wall is falling in. We have \ndebris in the road. They would get through with the meeting, everybody \nwould leave, and somebody would say: Did anybody get any assignments? \nDid they agree to do anything? No.\n\n[[Page S7319]]\n\n  The people that did do something, though, were in the Coast Guard. \nThey helped move people out before the hurricane, rescued people during \nand after the hurricane, and generally did a magnificent job. Do you \nknow why? Because they had this carved-out, unique position, even \nthough they were in the Department of Homeland Security. They didn't \nhave to go through the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security \nto do what was necessary.\n  Another example was the Seabees at Gulfport, MS. When they went to \nthese meetings with all of these muckety-mucks, all of these different \nagency heads, to hear the problems and do nothing about it, the Seabees \nwould make lists of things they could do and they went out and did it. \nThey went out and stopped the leaky water main. They went and removed \nthe debris so you could get into a neighborhood. They went to the \nschool and they took action to tear down or repair or fix a wall so it \nwould at least be safe for their children. You know what. They just did \nit.\n\n  By the way, they could have gotten in trouble because if FEMA hadn't \nagreed to reimbursement, they would have had to eat the cost of what \nthey did, and some captain in the Seabees could have been in real \njeopardy. But, thank goodness, they worked through it. They got \nreimbursed and did well.\n  So I think that is part of the problem. I asked the Seabees: Why were \nyou able to do that?\n  They said: Well, the chain of command was so long and laborious, we \ndecided we would find the things we could do and we would just go out \nand do it.\n  FEMA, I think, meanwhile, had been sort of pushed back into the back \n40 part of Homeland Security. They had been underfunded, undermanned, \nand had not been really getting the involvement and the attention they \nneeded. Plus, I was shocked one time when I heard the Secretary of \nHomeland Security complaining that the head of FEMA was going around \nhim directly to the President. Yes, he should have. You shouldn't have \nthe emergency management and recovery people having to check with the \nAssistant Secretary, the Deputy Secretary, the Secretary, the Chief of \nStaff, the OMB, to get to the President. This is an emergency. It is a \ndisaster, for heaven's sake. So I don't think it worked well.\n  I don't blame a lot of the good men and women at FEMA; I blame us. We \ndid it. We created a system that didn't work.\n  So I introduced legislation to move FEMA, like its predecessors, back \ninto a role as an independent agency with specific authorities for \nnatural disasters, reporting only to the President. I was joined in \nsponsoring that legislation by the Senator from New York, Mrs. Clinton, \nwho knows something about how the predecessor to FEMA worked under its \nAdministrator at the time, James Lee Witt, who also had a little \nexperience with disasters, although the ones he dealt with on 9/11, as \nthe Senator from New York knows, were manmade. Others joined in \ncosponsoring that legislation.\n  I still believe that is the best way to go. I think it should be \nindependent.\n  In the House, you have two separate approaches. You have the \nindependent approach and you have the approach that would keep it \nlocked in Homeland Security. But it seemed to me that there was a third \nway. There is always a third way, if you will just look for it. I think \nthat is one of the things we have lost in this institution. We get \nlocked into the Republican position, the Democratic position, or some \nother division, and then we won't talk to each other.\n  So Senator Collins, to her credit, on her own initiative, said: Can I \ncome talk to you about the proposal that Senator Lieberman and I have, \nwhich was to keep it in the Department of Homeland Security, with some \nchanges, and some recommendations I thought would have been positive \nbut still was not the solution I thought we needed. But she came and \ntook the time to explain it to me. It had some attractive features to \nit. She gave it more authority.\n  But then I thought about it for a while and I went back to her and I \nsaid: Let's find this third way. I think maybe the thing to do is to \ncarve FEMA out into a position like the Coast Guard but within the \nDepartment of Homeland Security but with an independent authority, the \nability to report directly to the President of the United States. Yes, \nthey could be involved in coordinating and in the preparation for \ndisasters of all kinds, but set them up basically independent within \nthe Department of Homeland Security.\n  I think it will work. An example is the Coast Guard. So much of the \nlanguage that we have in this amendment came from the Coast Guard \nlanguage. I know Senator Collins has taken the time to explain the \ndetails of what is proposed here, and I am painting a broader picture \nof what is involved. But we were able to come to an agreement. Her \nstaff was cooperative. My staff, which has had a lot of experience with \nthis sort of thing, worked with them, and we came to an agreement. By \nthe way, I then went to Senator Clinton and said: I think we can get \nsomething done if we do this, rather than just having a big fight. Do \nyou want a big fight or do you want a result? The new hurricane season \nis upon us.\n  Now, the media made it sound like on June 8, or whatever the date was \nthat hurricane season begins, we would get hit immediately. Well, those \nof us who are hurricane pros know that hurricanes generally don't hit \nin June and July, but they will come in August and September, and this \ntime it may not be Mississippi or Florida; it may be Maine. But it will \ncome somewhere. I don't want to be sitting around here complaining \nabout what it was like because FEMA did not have the authority they \nneeded, didn't have the money, didn't have the power they needed 6 \nmonths or a year from now. So we needed to get something done.\n  Senator Clinton understood what I was trying to do. It is part of the \nway I think we need to do things around here. It is part of being \nhonorable with each other. She had been a cosponsor. I thought I should \nexplain what I was working on doing. So we came to the agreement that \nhas been produced with this amendment. I think it makes good sense. I \nthink the House will find some wisdom in it, and the most important \nthing is we will get something done.\n\n  It is so difficult to move something through the Senate anymore. Do \nyou think we could really move a whole new, freestanding bill through \nthe Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, get it to the \nfloor of the Senate, all kinds of amendments--and let me tell you, I \nwould be one of the ones waiting here with lots of amendments. I have \nlots of other things stuck in my craw about the hurricanes that I am \nworried about for the future--or could we go with an amendment, which \nseems appropriate to me, to the Department of Homeland Security \nappropriations bill, get it to the House, get their input, and get a \nresult. Even then, it won't be perfect, but I believe it will be \nbetter. This is something we should do.\n  I will be coming back, until the last day I serve in this \ninstitution--whenever that may be--to talk to my colleagues about \nlessons we learned and things we can do that will hopefully help our \npeople be more secure; that will help people who will be hit with other \nkinds of disasters such as tornadoes, earthquakes, crickets, or \nwhatever, but we will do it better because of what we learned from \nHurricane Katrina.\n  So I am delighted to be here to support this amendment. In a perfect \nworld I might do it differently, or I might still insist that it can be \na separate entity. The amendment even proposes that it be renamed the \nEmergency Management Administration, I believe--EMA. It is something we \ncan say, and it is not a four-letter word. I think while that is not \ngoing to cure a single problem, it is part of creating a new atmosphere \nand a different mindset, hopefully.\n  I think the Administrator of FEMA that we have in place now, Mr. \nPaulson, is a good man. I think he is going to move toward trying to \nget professional disaster-experienced people in FEMA throughout this \ncountry, and I certainly hope he will.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and then support \nthis appropriations bill. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi for \nhis\n\n[[Page S7320]]\n\ncomments, for his support, and for his enormous contribution to the \namendment that is before us today. He, more than any other Member of \nthis body, has personal experience with the devastation that Hurricane \nKatrina caused, and he has been, along with Senator Cochran and the two \nLouisiana Senators, a fierce advocate for reforming the system to make \nsure that never again does government at all levels so fundamentally \nfail in its obligation to our citizens.\n  I very much appreciated the opportunity to work with Senator Lott to \nstrengthen the language in our bill to make sure that the exact same \nsafeguards and protections that the Coast Guard enjoys would now apply \nto the new FEMA organization: USEMA. I think that was an excellent \nsuggestion. We used the same language, and we will protect the new \nagency from being reorganized by the Secretary, from having its mission \naltered, from having it split up or dispersed or its budget cut through \nadministrative fiat. Those kinds of changes should come to Congress, \nand we have put those protections in place.\n  As Senator Lott recommended, we have upgraded the status of the whole \nagency. The head of the new agency will be the equivalent of a Deputy \nSecretary and will have the clout and the stature that is needed to \ndeal with other agencies. We have done enormous reforms. This version \nof an emergency management agency will have authorities that the \ncurrent FEMA has never had. In addition, we restored the preparedness \nand the grant-making functions, and I think we have come up with a very \ngood product.\n  So I want to thank my colleague and friend from Mississippi for his \nconsiderable contributions to this amendment, and I am very grateful \nthat he was willing to sit down and find--as he put it--a third way \nand, indeed, I believe, a far better solution. So I thank him for his \nsupport.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we are working toward getting an agreement. \nFor the edification of Members, if we can work that out, we will have \ntwo votes in approximately an hour, but that is not necessarily going \nto happen.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 20 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4563\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I call up amendment 4563 on behalf of \nSenator Clinton, myself, and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Akaka], for himself and Mrs. \n     Clinton, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Jeffords, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Lautenberg, \n     and Ms. Mikulski, proposes an amendment numbered 4563.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to propose an amendment for \nmyself and my good friend from New York to restore the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency--FEMA--to its proper place as an \nindependent agency.\n  Before I speak on our amendment, I would like to thank the chairman \nand ranking member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee for their hard work on this issue. We disagree on this one \npoint, but I appreciate all they have done over the past year to ensure \nthat the failures of Hurricane Katrina are never repeated.\n  As my colleagues on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee know, the placement of FEMA in the Department of Homeland \nSecurity--DHS--is a subject that has troubled me since the concept of \nthe Department was first debated in 2002. As a senior member of this \ncommittee, I can tell you that the structure of Federal agencies \nmatters. Combining too many disparate functions some of which have \nnothing to do with homeland security into one agency can be unworkable, \nwhich is a primary reason why I voted against the creation of DHS.\n  Some say reinstating FEMA's independence now is brash and premature. \nRespectfully, I could not disagree more. To me, it was premature to \nplace FEMA within DHS, a huge, terrorism-focused agency, where FEMA's \ntraditional mission of responding to disasters would be neglected. The \nFEMA of yesterday has been downgraded, dismantled, and demoralized \nwhich I believe contributed to the muddled response to Hurricane \nKatrina.\n  DHS failed as a department during Hurricane Katrina and failed to \ngive FEMA the opportunity to succeed. During the Committee's Katrina \nhearings, we heard numerous examples of information and initiative \ngetting lost in DHS during the Hurricane Katrina response. Witnesses \ndescribed sending information updates and requests out to the \nDepartment, never knowing where those messages went or if requested \naction had been taken. DHS was a black hole where information and \naccountability were lost.\n  Since FEMA was folded into the Department, FEMA has been deprived of \nfunding and resources. FEMA has been forced to transfer significant \nresources to other parts of the Department. In 2003 and 2004, $169 \nmillion of FEMA's funding was transferred to DHS, in part because of \nlost programs, but also because of a so-called management tax to help \npay for shared services within the Department.\n  Congress and the American public never knew about these funding \nshortfalls because FEMA was buried within DHS. Former FEMA Director \nMichael Brown testified that instead of taking FEMA's budget proposal \nto the President, he was required to clear the budget through another \nUndersecretary at DHS, then the Secretary, and then the President.\n  With a loss of funding and programs, came a loss of staff. FEMA's \nstaff has been reduced by 500 positions since 2003. And within the \nexisting positions at FEMA, there has been a 15 to 20 percent vacancy \nrate over the past few years.\n  FEMA needs to be an independent, Cabinet-level agency to avoid having \nits budget and staff siphoned off for other activities within the \nDepartment. Restoring the FEMA Director to the President's Cabinet will \nbetter serve America. Restoring FEMA's place at the table will ensure \ntransparency and accountability while allowing the Director to present \nfunding needs directly to the President. In 1996, recognizing the \nimportance of emergency response, President Clinton elevated the FEMA \nDirector position to the Cabinet level. Former FEMA Director James Lee \nWitt said being a member of the President's Cabinet allowed him to task \nother Federal agencies more effectively during disasters and provided \nan established and direct line of communication to the President.\n  There are those who argue that FEMA needs to remain in DHS so that \nthe Department's other personnel and assets can be accessed more \nreadily. This is a hollow argument because under the Stafford Act, FEMA \nhas the authority to utilize resources across the Federal Government \nduring a disaster. The Stafford Act allows FEMA to task Health and \nHuman Services, the Department of Transportation, the Department of \nDefense, and many other Federal agencies during disasters. Should all \nthose entities be incorporated into DHS as well? There is no reason the \nsame mission assignment procedure cannot be applied to DHS assets as \nwell.\n  Separating FEMA from DHS not only will improve FEMA's ability to \nmanage preparedness and response, but it also will allow DHS to focus \non its mission to prevent a terrorist attack. DHS cannot be all things \nto all people.\n  The dedicated public servants of FEMA agree. The American Federation \nof Government Employees--AFGE--which represents 1,200 FEMA employees, \nstrongly endorses an independent\n\n[[Page S7321]]\n\nFEMA. AFGE's June 13, 2006, letter to Congress states:\n\n       (T)he merger of FEMA into DHS may have sounded good in \n     theory, but in reality it has proven to be impractical and \n     counterproductive. When Hurricane Katrina struck the U.S., \n     the DHS structure simply imposed an extra layer of \n     bureaucracy on top of FEMA, and wound up impeding, not \n     assisting, the response.\n\n  Former FEMA Director Witt also believes FEMA does not belong in DHS. \nIn a recent editorial, he stated:\n\n       Though most agree FEMA must be mended, we don't have the \n     luxury of gambling with another experimental restructuring of \n     the department. And why gamble when a simple reversion to its \n     pre-2001 incarnation would fix the problem? . . . As it \n     stands under today's DHS structure, annual hazards such as \n     hurricanes, floods, and tornados are allowed a 25 percent \n     focus, even though they have a 100 percent probability of \n     occurring at some point. An independent FEMA would again give \n     all disasters 100 percent of its attention.\n\n  I agree with Mr. Witt. Fortunately, since DHS was created, there has \nnot been another terrorist attack in the U.S. although there have been \nover 100 Presidentially-declared natural disasters. I support ensuring \nthe U.S. is prepared for a terrorist attack, but we should not forget \nthat natural disasters are guaranteed to occur every single year.\n  Mr. President, we have tried the superagency approach, and now it is \ntime to get back to basics. I ask my colleagues to think about what is \npractical when they cast their vote on our amendment. Our constituents \nshould feel confident that FEMA and its resources will be there in \ntheir time of need.\n  I urge support for our amendment. I yield back my remaining time.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the Senator from \nHawaii, who has been a strong voice on behalf of our Nation's security \nand joins with me in putting before the Senate one of the most \nimportant issues we face: How will we manage our emergency preparedness \nand response?\n  I have the greatest respect and regard for my colleagues, Senator \nCollins and Senator Lieberman. They have done an extraordinary job in \nleading a committee that has had so much responsibility over the last \nmonths for the well-being and the homeland security of our Nation. I \nrespectfully disagree with the solution they are putting forth, but I \nknow it comes after not only many hearings but incredible thought and \nextraordinary attention to the details about how best to rescue the \nsituation in which we find ourselves.\n  We had a functioning, effective Federal Emergency Management Agency \n5\\1/2\\ years ago. By all accounts, on all sides of the political \nspectrum, we had a crown jewel, an agency where performance was highly \nregarded not only in our own country but literally around the world. \nUnfortunately, that agency became a victim of the governing philosophy \nof the current administration.\n  We have seen, in stark terms, the failures of the existing Federal \nEmergency Management Agency, so-called FEMA. We saw it in the \ndisastrous failures in the days and weeks, continuing until this day, \nalong our gulf coast when people lost everything--their homes, their \nneighborhoods, their churches, even their loved ones. Our Nation lost \nsomething precious as well: we lost faith in our Federal Government and \nin the response capabilities of the organization that until 5\\1/2\\ \nyears ago we could count on.\n  When we created the Department of Homeland Security after September \n11, I warned, along with others, that moving FEMA into that large \nbureaucracy was a mistake. I said that on the basis of what I thought \nwas the mission of the Department of Homeland Security, which was, \nfirst and foremost, to deal with the potential for terrorism and to \ndeter and prevent terrorist attacks like the horrific attacks of \nSeptember 11.\n  The decision was made to move FEMA into the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, and my worst fears came true. It became a stepchild. It \nbecame a holding pen for political cronies. It was no longer viewed as \nthe crown jewel of the Federal Government but as a stepchild that did \nnot really deserve the attention and the resources of this \nadministration. Our worst fears about what would happen to FEMA in the \nDepartment of Homeland Security came true when we saw the images on \ntelevision coming out of New Orleans and up and down the gulf coast.\n  I applaud Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman for the \nextraordinarily thorough investigation they did. We got even more \nsickening detail of e-mails from FEMA officials at the time the \ndisaster struck, what their concerns were--which were hardly focused on \nsaving the people who were suffering. We have seen thousands of people \ndisplaced. We see 10,000 mobile homes sitting empty at the Hope, AR, \nMunicipal Airport, and on and on. We have a GAO report that says there \nmay have been up to $1 billion--yes, that is billion with a ``b''--$1 \nbillion in Federal assistance that has been misspent.\n  It is not only the facts about Katrina that bring me to urge we \nrestore FEMA to an independent status, give it back Cabinet-level \naccess, make it independent of the behemoth that the bureaucracy of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security has become, but it is also my worry \nabout the future.\n  Hurricane Katrina was a foreseen disaster. We watched it on the \nWeather Channel. We saw it coming across the gulf. It was not a sneak \nattack by suicide bombers in airplanes, it was a huge storm. I worry, \nas incompetent as FEMA has become, how would they handle the \nunforeseen?\n  It is tragic to me that we have come to this position, and I think \nthe new leadership at FEMA is laboring mightily to try to turn the \nsituation around. But I worry it will be impossible, if FEMA stays \nwithin the Department of Homeland Security. If it stays within the \nDepartment and is renamed and reconfigured, I do not think that \neliminates the primary problem, which is that it is stuck in a \ndepartment with a focus and mission that cannot help but be to try to \nprevent and deter terrorist attacks. Believe me, I am all for that. We \nare about to come up on the fifth anniversary year of the attacks of 9/\n11.\n  Although I really respect what Senators Collins and Lieberman are \ntrying to do, I think they are trying to fit a square peg into a round \nhole. They are stuck with the Department of Homeland Security, and so \nthey are trying to figure out a way to shoehorn it in, to detour around \nthe dysfunctional organization and leadership that the Department has. \nAnd I do not think that will work.\n  The amendment Senator Akaka and I and others have offered would do \nthree things: first, reinstitute FEMA as an independent Cabinet-level \nagency; second, require the Director and Deputy Director to have the \nappropriate emergency service qualifications; and third, require the \nFEMA Director to report directly to the President of the United States.\n  During Katrina, who was in charge? Was it our President? Was it the \nSecretary of the Department of Homeland Security? Was it the FEMA \nDirector? I do not know who it was. And one of the problems is that no \none was. If we just sort of move the deck chairs on the Titanic, I do \nnot think that solves the problem.\n  FEMA's response capabilities have been degraded since Katrina even, \nbecause people are not there. They are not able to have the same sense \nof morale and commitment. When you look at all the reports that have \nbeen done--one from the White House, one from the Senate, one from the \nHouse, as well as the various reports from the Government \nAccountability Office--you can see all of the things that went wrong. \nUnfortunately, these reports have not been coordinated, and it is very \ndifficult to figure out how we are going to get ourselves back on the \nright track with a functioning world-class FEMA, and I just do not \nbelieve the answer is for it to operate as a subagency within the \nDepartment.\n  Now, I know there are those who are rightly concerned that if we take \nFEMA back to an independent status, then we will have duplicative \nefforts, we will not have coordination. I think the amendment tries to \nspecifically say this does not detract in any way from the Department \nof Homeland Security's mission to secure the homeland. But I believe \nhaving it back in an independent status, with full accountability to \nthe President, statutory authority under the Stafford Act to carry out \nall of the necessary mitigation, response, and recovery actions, is the \nway to go. If under our amendment we\n\n[[Page S7322]]\n\nmake FEMA report directly to the President, then the FEMA Director will \nhave more authority under Stafford Act designation than if he is a sub-\nCabinet official within DHS.\n  My bottom line is we should get FEMA back to a functioning, effective \nagency again, and there is a difference of opinion about how best to do \nthat. Obviously, we are back in hurricane season. We do not want to do \nanything, either within a reorganization or an independent status, that \nwould further disable FEMA from responding. But if we reempower FEMA, \nrestore its independence, and staff it with qualified people, we will \nbe back on the right track.\n  We have a regional structure for FEMA, and it is not clear from the \nproposal from the committee how that will work, who appoints those \nregional directors, who has to be in charge. I do not want people \nexchanging business cards at the site of a disaster, which is what has \nbeen happening. I believe we have to build on the strong track record \nFEMA had during the 1990s.\n  I know the committee has said this would be comparable to the Coast \nGuard, but I think that is a slightly different role and mission. The \nCoast Guard is a military, multimissioned maritime service. It is one \nof our Nation's five armed services. Its mission is to ``protect the \npublic, the environment, and U.S. economic interests--in the nation's \nports and waterways, along the coast, on international waters, or in \nany maritime region as required to support national security.''\n  They did a superb job with respect to Katrina and Rita. But FEMA has \na different role. It is supposed to be managing dollars of considerable \nnumbers in advance of catastrophic events, coordinating Federal \nagencies, carrying out the President's statutory authority for \nemergency response. It is supposed to be the go-to entity for full \nmanagement.\n  I believe we have a better chance of getting back the FEMA we should \nhave, that the people should be able to count on, that can work with \nState and local governments, that can help to mitigate disasters, by \nreturning it to independence.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask our colleagues to support the amendment to \nrestore FEMA to an effective, independent, Cabinet-level agency once \nagain and send a message to the country that FEMA is back--it is back, \nit is ready for business, and people can have trust in it once again.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, in deciding how to vote on this issue, I \nwould encourage our colleagues to consult the experts, the first \nresponder organizations that overwhelmingly support the Collins-\nLieberman-Lott-Carper approach and do not support the amendment that \nhas been proposed by my colleagues from New York and Hawaii.\n  For example, the International Association of Fire Fighters, which \nrepresents 270,000 professional firefighters and emergency medical \npersonnel, has endorsed the Collins-Lieberman-Lott-Carper amendment and \nsays this about the alternative approach we have just heard described:\n\n       We believe that proposals to return FEMA to its status as \n     an independent agency would hinder efforts to reform our \n     nation's emergency response system. Removing FEMA from DHS \n     would create competing agencies, sowing confusion among \n     emergency responders. Furthermore, such an approach would \n     undermine an all-hazards approach, leading to the perception \n     that DHS deals with terrorism while FEMA is in charge of \n     natural disasters.\n\n  That is what the International Association of Fire Fighters says.\n  Other groups, such as the Major Cities Chiefs Association, say \nsomething very similar; the National Troopers Coalition, the National \nAssociation of Police Organizations, Advocates for EMS--the list goes \non and on and on. The fact is, those who put their lives on the line, \nwho are on the front lines of emergency response, say it would be a \ncolossal mistake to take FEMA out of DHS, to sever that connection.\n  Does the Senator from New Hampshire wish for me to yield the floor?\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator would yield so we could enter into a \nunanimous consent agreement. I believe we have reached an agreement \nwhere we can proceed to lock in the vote on the Senator's amendment and \nthe amendment offered by Senator Akaka and Senator Clinton.\n  Mr. President, the request is as follows: I ask unanimous consent \nthat at the conclusion of the Senator's remarks, Senator Lautenberg be \nrecognized for 15 minutes, and that at the conclusion of his remarks, \nwe would go to a vote on Senator Collins' amendment, with no second \ndegrees being in order--and there would be 2 minutes equally divided \nprior to that vote--and that at the conclusion of the vote on Senator \nCollins' amendment, we would go to a vote on the amendment offered by \nSenator Akaka and Senator Clinton, with 2 minutes equally divided prior \nto that vote----\n  Mrs. MURRAY. With no second degrees.\n  Mr. GREGG. With no second degrees and no points of order against \neither amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. That would mean--how long will the Senator probably be \nspeaking?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. So that would mean the votes would begin at around 6:15, \none would presume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, those who are on the front lines--our \npolice associations, our firefighters associations, the emergency \nmedical personnel organizations--have all endorsed the approach we have \nsuggested. This approach would strengthen FEMA but leave it within the \nDepartment of Homeland Security so we can establish a comprehensive \nall-hazards approach to emergency management.\n  We do not want to take FEMA out of the Department in the way \nparticularly that Senator Clinton's and Senator Akaka's amendment would \nentail. I refer my colleagues to page 7 of their amendment, section \n612, ``Transfer Of Functions.'' This provision says the functions FEMA \nhas as of the date of enactment should be transferred to the new \nagency. Well, let me tell you what that means. That means that \npreparedness would still be separate from response despite the fact \nthat the experts agree that one of the reasons for FEMA's weak \nperformance was the separation of preparedness from response--two sides \nof the same coin that should be together in one agency. Yet the \nClinton-Akaka amendment keeps preparedness within the Department of \nHomeland Security and only has the response functions going to the new \nindependent agency that they would propose.\n  Our bill consolidates the grant-making for preparedness--that is \nbillions of dollars of preparedness grants--we would put in the new \nFEMA. Infrastructure protection, the national communications system, \nthe chief medical officer, the cybersecurity office all would be in \nthis new agency which we call the U.S. Emergency Management Authority. \nSo we are not simply leaving FEMA within the Department of Homeland \nSecurity; we are strengthening, reforming, and upgrading FEMA so it can \nbe effective.\n  I must say, I am at a loss why the proponents of the alternative \napproach want to take a FEMA that everyone deems is inadequate and has \npoorly performed, take this shell of an agency that has been stripped \nof many of its essential functions and cast it adrift by making it an \nindependent agency. That approach makes absolutely no sense at all.\n  If the problem were FEMA's location, then why did the Coast Guard do \nsuch a stellar job in performing in response to Hurricane Katrina? By \nall accounts, the Coast Guard's preparedness and its response were \nsuperb. It pre-positioned its assets, it responded quickly, and it \nrescued some 35,000 people.\n  If the problem, in fact, were the location of the agency, then how \ndid the Coast Guard manage to do such a good job? It is part of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. Obviously, that is not the issue.\n  What we have done in our proposal is give the new emergency \nmanagement agency the same kinds of protections that the Coast Guard \nhas within DHS. No longer could the agency's mission be altered or its \nassets stripped away or could it be reorganized. You would have to come \nto Congress to do that. The issue is how can we best create a\n\n[[Page S7323]]\n\nstrong emergency management agency. That is the question that our \nproposal answers. It stresses giving FEMA back the authorities that \nwere stripped away. It emphasizes giving it new authority so that it \ncan be a strong, all-hazards agency. It elevates the stature of the \nappointees. It requires them to have relevant experience for those \npositions. It gives it the tools to do the job effectively. It protects \nit from reorganization. It makes the head of the new agency the \nprincipal adviser to the President on emergency management, but it \nallows it to have all the advantages of being part of the Department of \nHomeland Security, the advantage of a close relationship with the Coast \nGuard, a close relationship with the law enforcement agencies that are \nwithin DHS.\n  Taking the weakened version of FEMA and casting it adrift and \nthinking that somehow that is going to solve the problem flies in the \nface of the 23 hearings that we held to get to this solution, the \n838,000 pages of evidence, the 325 people we interviewed, and the \nexpertise of the first responder community. It would be a terrible \nmistake.\n  The Hart-Rudman commission 5 years ago said FEMA is the essential \ncore of DHS, and they are right. If FEMA were pulled out of DHS, DHS \nwould be forced to create a very similar, costly, duplicative agency in \norder to handle a response to terrorist attacks. It makes no sense to \nhave one agency that deals with natural disasters and another agency \nwithin DHS that deals with the response to terrorist attacks. If the \nlevees in New Orleans had been bombed rather than breached, the same \nchallenges of evacuation, sheltering, and caring for individuals would \nhave been present. It makes no sense and will be extremely costly--to \nthe tune of billions of dollars, according to Secretary Chertoff--for \nus to have to recreate within DHS essential capabilities that DHS will \nneed if FEMA is taken out of the Department.\n  I am reminded during this debate of a saying by H.L. Mencken that for \nevery problem there is a solution that is neat, plausible, and wrong. \nTaking FEMA out of the Department of Homeland Security is wrong. At \nfirst blush it may look like the easy solution. But after looking at \nthis issue for more than 8 months, it is not the solution. I hope our \ncolleagues will listen to the true experts, our first responders and \ntheir organizations warning that this would be a disaster, that it \nwould force them and State and local emergency managers to have to deal \nwith two agencies, two sets of regulations, depending on whether or not \nthis was the result of a terrorist attack or a natural disaster. That \nis contrary to the all-hazards approach that the experts have \nencouraged us to take.\n  The Homeland Security Council, a very prestigious group of private \nsector businesses and experts, conducted its own 6-month review of what \nwent wrong with the preparedness and response to Hurricane Katrina. It, \ntoo, concluded that DHS preparedness assets and FEMA need to be more \nclosely aligned, not split apart into two separate agencies.\n  I am going to reserve the remainder of my time. It is my \nunderstanding Senator Lautenberg will be speaking on this issue.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, since Senator Lautenberg has not arrived, \nI am going to continue to expound on why the Collins-Lieberman-Lott-\nCarper amendment should be agreed to and the Clinton-Akaka amendment \nshould be rejected.\n  As I look at this issue, I realize that people look back at FEMA with \nrose-colored glasses. There is this myth of the golden age of FEMA. \nIndeed, FEMA in the past has had some talented leaders which proves my \npoint that this really is about leadership more than anything. Clearly, \nMichael Brown was an abysmal failure as FEMA's leader. There is \nunanimity on that as well. But the fact is, when FEMA was an \nindependent agency, it also experienced severe problems dealing with \nmajor disasters.\n  If you look at the GAO and other reports, and, indeed, the hearing \nrecords before the committee I now chair back after Hurricane Andrew in \n1992, you could take out the word ``Andrew'' and substitute \n``Katrina,'' and you would get exactly the same indictment. In the \nhearing after Hurricane Andrew, my colleague, Senator Akaka, noted the \ndifficulties that FEMA has had with response to catastrophic disasters. \nIt is those catastrophic disasters, the fact is, that FEMA has never \nbeen able to handle, both when it was independent and when it was in \nDHS.\n  Our committee's bipartisan recommendation seeks to correct that \nproblem by creating an agency with the capabilities for the first time \nto manage catastrophic disasters.\n  The Government Accountability Office found that FEMA's response to \nHurricane Andrew in 1992 ``raised serious doubts about whether FEMA is \ncapable of responding to catastrophic disasters.'' This is when FEMA \nwas an independent agency. In particular, the GAO said that ``the \nFederal strategy for response lacked provisions to assess damage, the \nneeds of victims, to provide food, shelter, and other essential \nservices when the needs of victims outstrip State and local \nresources.''\n  You could apply exactly the same words to what happened after \nKatrina. What we need is to build an agency that does have the capacity \nto respond to not just small- and medium-sized disasters but to true \ncatastrophes. That is what our bill would do. We would have a stronger \nagency, better led, better organized, with new authorities and powers \nthat FEMA has never had. We would give it the resources to be \neffective.\n  Another important part of our amendment that, again, the Clinton-\nAkaka amendment completely lacks is the creation of regional strike \nteams that would be located in regions of the country and have \nrepresentatives of all the Federal agencies that are involved in \nresponding to a disaster. These strike teams would plan, train, and \nexercise with their State and local counterparts and with private \nsector groups that are involved in responding to a disaster such as the \nRed Cross and the Salvation Army. That is the kind of approach we need \nto be effective. We should have people in the region who already know \nthe local officials, the vulnerabilities, the weaknesses, the \nstrengths, the capabilities of the State and local systems, and can \nmake sure that there are effective plans in place. We don't have that \nnow.\n  When Katrina struck, people were sent from region 1 in New England \ndown to New Orleans and Mississippi to help out. They didn't know the \npeople. They didn't know the geography. They didn't know the culture. \nThey didn't have that much experience in dealing with hurricanes. That \ndoesn't make any sense at all. We should have regionally based teams \nthat can work with their partners at the State and local level and in \nthe private sector. I am talking about working not just with the \nnonprofits such as the Red Cross and Salvation Army but also with the \nprivate sector, such as the local utility companies. That is an \nimportant partner as well. Instead, what we found with Katrina were \nproblems in credentialing utility workers and other private sector \nworkers so they couldn't, in some cases, gain access to the disaster \narea.\n  We have given a lot of thought to how to do this right. This wasn't \ncobbled together overnight. It avoids the simplistic solution, which is \nno solution at all, of just saying: Let's take this weak, dysfunctional \nagency, this discredited agency, cut it loose from DHS, and somehow all \nwill be well.\n  All will not be well. In fact, it would be a disaster to have FEMA, \nwith its very limited current authorities, cast off as a separate \nagency.\n  Thad Allen said it well when he pointed out that since FEMA and the \nCoast Guard have been part of the same Department, there has been a \n350-percent increase in joint training. That is what we want. We don't \nwant a bureaucratic structure. We want people to plan, train, and \nexercise together. If they are in different agencies, that is not going \nto happen. FEMA is not going to have the advantage of working closely \nwith those relevant agencies within the Department.\n\n[[Page S7324]]\n\n  Another problem of the Clinton-Akaka amendment is that it would leave \nthe preparedness functions in the Department of Homeland Security. I \nsuspect I know why they did that. They did that because they realize \nthe Department of Homeland Security has to have those preparedness \nfunctions. It needs to be able to prepare to respond to a terrorist \nattack. So they kept that function there.\n  But how does it make sense for FEMA to be only a response agency? \nThat is what led us to the failed response to Katrina. Preparedness had \nbeen stripped off from FEMA. So this makes no sense at all.\n  Another criticism has been that FEMA lacks right now the authority to \naward preparedness grants. Yet the Clinton-Akaka amendment keeps that \nproblem. It would keep the preparedness grants that go to State and \nlocal governments in the Department of Homeland Security, and yet would \nhave this agency, FEMA, which is supposed to be working with State and \nlocal governments, with no authority over the funding for preparedness. \nThat doesn't make any sense either.\n  I hope this body will recognize that the Homeland Security Committee \nhas done a great deal of work. I hope they will listen to these first \nresponder groups who say: Keep FEMA within DHS, but make it work. That \nis exactly what our amendment would do.\n  I see that the Senator from Connecticut has come to the floor. I \nwould like to yield to him, if that is acceptable with the manager of \nthe bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, as I understand the time agreement, the \nSenator from Maine had no limitation on her time, but at the conclusion \nof her remarks, the Senator from New Jersey was to be recognized for 15 \nminutes. If her remarks are completed, the time will begin to run \nagainst the Senator from New Jersey. It will take a new unanimous \nconsent request, I suspect, to yield to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  How much time does the Senator from Connecticut wish?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I would just say amen to everything Senator Collins \nhas said, but I will speak for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. If there is no objection, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Connecticut be recognized for 5 minutes, then the Senator \nfrom New Jersey be recognized for 15 minutes, and then the vote occur \n20 minutes from now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to quite literally \nsay amen to everything Senator Collins has said on behalf of our \namendment and in respectful opposition to the amendment that Senator \nClinton has proposed.\n  We had a disaster, a catastrophe last year in Hurricane Katrina that \nwas natural, and then we had a manmade disaster which was the \nshockingly inadequate response of the Federal, State, and local \ngovernments to that catastrophe that was called Katrina. So our \ncommittee spent months investigating, told the story, and considered \nwhat we could do to make sure nothing like the Federal Government's \ninadequate, incompetent reaction and response ever occurred again.\n  We considered the responsibility that some have raised of taking \nFEMA, or a replacement agency such as we are proposing, out of the \nDepartment and making it independent again. But it made no sense to us. \nIf you have a Department of Homeland Security, which is supposed to be \nour major Department to prepare for and respond to disasters, natural \nand manmade, then why would we want to take the emergency management \nagency, which is all about responding to disasters, natural and \nterrorist, out of that Department? It would be, as I said at one of our \nhearings, like taking the U.S. Army out of the Department of Defense \nbecause you were not happy with the management of the U.S. Army, so you \ntake it out. Or you had memories that there used to be a Chief of the \nArmy who was good in a different time way back when it was independent, \nand you make it independent. It makes no sense. It is inefficient. I am \nafraid it would compromise the ability of our Government to prepare for \nand respond to another disaster.\n  In some ways, this is a comparison between James Lee Witt and Michael \nBrown. I will be real specific about it. I am happy to say in public \nthat James Lee Witt did a great job, and Michael Brown did not, \nparticularly in Katrina. That shouldn't lead us to think that going \nback to the time when FEMA was independent and James Lee Witt was the \nDirector would solve all of our problems.\n  FEMA, under James Lee Witt, as good as he was--and he was very good--\nnever faced a catastrophe such as Katrina. We heard testimony to this \neffect from people in the Department, from inspectors general, from \noutside authorities that FEMA never, no matter how good James Lee Witt \nwas, could have independently given an adequate response to a \ncatastrophe such as Hurricane Katrina or, God forbid, a catastrophe \nsuch as a significant terrorist attack. That is why we kept FEMA, our \nnew USEMA, in the Department of Homeland Security.\n  We have strengthened it considerably. Senator Lott, who was an \ninitial cosponsor of the amendment to take FEMA out of the Department \nof Homeland Security, is now with us on keeping it in the Department \nbecause we made some significant changes. We gave the U.S. Emergency \nManagement Agency that we would create, USEMA, the special legal status \nthat only the Coast Guard and Secret Service have within the Department \nof Homeland Security. That means it cannot be changed except by \nstatute. No executive action can change its status.\n  We also made clear that during a time of crisis, though the head of \nthe U.S. Emergency Management Authority normally reports to the \nSecretary of Homeland Security, that person reports directly to the \nPresident of the United States.\n\n  I happen to have joined with Senator Specter, my friend and colleague \nfrom Pennsylvania, in introducing the original legislation to create \nthe Department of Homeland Security. We did it a month or two after 9/\n11 because we felt we had entered a new age. We had been attacked here \nat home, innocent citizens were killed by terrorists, and we needed a \nwhole new structure to prepare to defend the American people against \nsimilar attacks in the future--our enemies are still obviously out \nthere--and to respond to those attacks.\n  We built our proposal on the work of an independent commission headed \nby our former colleagues Warren Rudman and Gary Hart. They said loudly \nand clearly that FEMA must be the heart of this new Department if it is \nto adequately protect the American people from disaster or terrorism.\n  It would be a profound mistake to take it out. That is why I urge my \ncolleagues to support the amendment that Senator Collins and I are \noffering with Senator Carper and Senator Lott, and to oppose the \namendment of Senator Clinton.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I saw Senator Lautenberg come into the Chamber. I do \nnot see him now, so I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for 13 minutes 25 seconds.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the \nSenator from Maine, the chairperson of the committee on which we both \nserve. I am trying to figure out why a name change might be part of the \nplan to try to make FEMA a more efficient agency. I think we are \nchasing our tail around the tree because I don't see how we can do it \nunder the present structure.\n  I want to start at the beginning. I don't plan to take all the time \nthat is available. I would like to go back a little bit.\n  When we look at the structure of DHS, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, we see the complications that exist even today with its \ngeneral functioning: Are the screeners doing an effective job? Do we \nhave too many?\n\n[[Page S7325]]\n\nThey were once publicly owned groups across the country, and they were \ndoing a poor job. Then we brought them into the Government and their \nperformance improved substantially. Now there is talk about whether we \nought to put them back into private hands.\n  I think about the task of Secretary Chertoff--and Secretary Chertoff \nis someone I know very well and for whom I have a great deal of \nrespect--when we look at the assignment--22 Departments, 180,000 \npeople, budgets that are insufficient to start with, and then the \nsquabbling, the arm wrestling that has to take place within the \nDepartment to try and get FEMA enough money. It just doesn't make sense \nto have this Department of Government surrounded by the rest of the \nstructure that is so complicated within DHS.\n  There was a time when FEMA was called upon to act as a result of \nnatural disasters, and they did it very well. James Lee Witt was the \nhead of FEMA. In 1993, we had what was the equivalent of a 100-year \nflood in Mississippi, and FEMA acted professionally and efficiently and \ngot the job done. Then we had the Northridge earthquake which was one \nof the worst disasters we have seen. Once again, FEMA stood up to the \ntask and did it efficiently and responded very promptly to get that \ndone.\n  I, for one, believe, as does the Senator from New York, Mrs. Clinton, \nthat FEMA ought to be removed, ought to be independent, and to give it \na chance to fight for its own budget, to make its own case, to be able \nto have direct contact with the President's office.\n  When we think about it, we worry an awful lot about a terrorist \nattack on our soil, and we should, and we should fight to protect our \ncitizens from the consequences of that kind of an event. But, also, \nwhen we look at what happened with natural disasters and the \nsignificant--just look at Katrina and see what has happened there. \nThere is a whole sector in our country that has yet to recover.\n  We are going to be at the first anniversary of Katrina in less than 2 \nmonths, and there are still people living in unacceptable conditions, \nstill the restoration has not taken place--the theft, the waste, the \nfraud that has taken place there, and we look and we say: What has \nhappened here? Why isn't it better? It isn't better because the \nstructure doesn't permit it to get better with any degree of ease. In \nmy view, FEMA has to be a separate department, as it once was, to be \nable to function as it once did under a different kind of leadership.\n\n  Who can forget the consequences of the first strike of the storm when \nthe President of the United States was busy in California. He didn't \nvisit the scene until a couple of days had passed, and he did that from \n30,000 feet in the air and called it a devastating sight and gave \ncongratulations to Mr. Brown: Brownie, heck of a job.\n  Did the President not know what he was saying or did he make a \nmistake? The fact is, there was so much confusion with the \ncommunications links that it was almost impossible to decipher what was \ngoing to happen, who was responsible, who was out to dinner when they \nwere crying for help in the various communities, until someone reached \nover the top, went past the organizational structure, and got to the \nPresident's office. Then things began to happen. And they didn't happen \nvery efficiently, nor did they happen thoroughly.\n  I think if we separated FEMA from the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, it would give our new director--who holds high hope, I think, \nfor all of us; he is a competent person. He has experience before he \ncame to FEMA. He has a very positive background for this kind of job. \nHe is new on the job, and I think it would give him a much stronger \nhand in the annual battle over the agency's budget and appropriations. \nObviously, then, it would free FEMA of several layers of bureaucracy at \nDHS and make it easier for the agency to do its job.\n  We talk so often around here about the bureaucracy and how tough it \nis to work your way through it. But here we have this critical agency, \nthe agency that has more direct responsibility for our national \nsecurity within our boundaries, on our land, than any other agency, and \nwe keep it as a part of a total mechanical structure that says: OK, \nmake sure you get A, B, C, and D. I think that is the wrong approach to \nhaving FEMA do the job we want it to do.\n  It is obvious that FEMA was weak and ineffective and showed a great \ndeal of incompetence. What we want to do is streamline the agency as \nmuch as we can, and this is an opportunity to do just that. We are not \ngoing to rely on picking friends--cronies, if I can use the term, \npolitical campaign workers--to do this job and expect to have it \nsucceed. That is not the way you take a position like this and have it \nbe able to do its job, the job of jumping in there in the middle of a \nnatural disaster of people searching for relatives, searching for a way \nout. What do you do to replace a reasonable living condition for them? \nIt is a very tough job.\n  I think FEMA's subservient position inside DHS has contributed to low \nmorale and the loss of qualified professional staff, and it is \ndifficult attracting experienced personnel back to the agency. The \nagency has lost so much of its former excellent reputation that people \nare not anxious to go to an agency like that.\n  So I think the way we have to do it is the way Senator Clinton and I \nand others are supportive of, which is the separation of FEMA from the \nDepartment. Separate FEMA. Let it stand on its own two feet. Let it \nstrive for its own budget. Let it hire its personnel under its own \nstructure and give it the responsibilities that it deserves and the \nresources that it needs.\n  So I hope at this point that people will vote against the amendment \nSenator Collins has presented and support the Clinton amendment that \ncalls for FEMA to be separated from DHS, stand alone, and let it make \nits case.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the \napproach offered by the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman, and \nSenator Lott, Senator Carper, and myself, and reject the approach \noffered by Senator Clinton and Senator Akaka.\n  Senator Clinton said earlier that we are rearranging the deck chairs \non the Titanic but, in fact, that is what her amendment does. It takes \nthe weak FEMA that we have now and moves it outside of the Department \nwith no new personnel, no new function, no new authorities, no new \nfunding, no infrastructure protection responsibilities, no new \ncommunications assets, no new medical assets, no new cyber-security \nassets.\n  That is exactly contrary to the approach that we have taken. We have \nbuilt a new FEMA within the Department with strong authorities--\nauthorities that FEMA has never had--to allow it to respond effectively \nto a disaster, regardless of its size. We create a new regional \nstructure that will improve the management and the relationship with \nState and local governments. That is why the first responder groups are \nall supporting the Collins-Lieberman amendment, and I hope my \ncolleagues will, too.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield back the time in opposition, and I \nask for the yeas and nays on the Collins amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is 2 minutes equally divided on the \nClinton amendment.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, the recently passed amendment did try to \nimprove upon the status quo, and I commend Senators Collins and \nLieberman for attempting to do so. But the answer is we need to restore \nthe independence of FEMA. We need to give back to it Cabinet-level \nstatus with a direct line to the President. My amendment will allow us \nto do that. I urge you to vote for this amendment even if you voted for \nthe last amendment because it improves the status quo vote which gets \nus back to the kind of independent FEMA that can actually respond to \ndisasters and mitigate and help us prepare for them.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the Clinton-Akaka amendment does nothing \nto strengthen FEMA. It takes a weak FEMA and casts it adrift as an \nindependent agency. It is not the answer. My colleagues, you have just \nvoted for the right reform. I urge opposition to the Clinton amendment, \nas do all the first responder groups.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.

IMMIGRATION INJUNCTION REFORM.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Fairness in Immigration Litigation Act of 2006''.\n       (b) Appropriate Remedies for Immigration Legislation.--\n       (1) Requirements for an order granting prospective relief \n     against the government.--\n       (A) In general.--If a court determines that prospective \n     relief should be ordered against the Government in any civil \n     action pertaining to the administration or enforcement of the \n     immigration laws of the United States, the court shall--\n       (i) limit the relief to the minimum necessary to correct \n     the violation of law;\n       (ii) adopt the least intrusive means to correct the \n     violation of law;\n       (iii) minimize, to the greatest extent practicable, the \n     adverse impact on national security, border security, \n     immigration administration and enforcement, and public \n     safety, and\n       (iv) provide for the expiration of the relief on a specific \n     date, which is not later than the earliest date necessary for \n     the Government to remedy the violation.\n       (B) Written explanation.--The requirements described in \n     subparagraph (A) shall be discussed and explained in writing \n     in the order granting prospective relief and must be \n     sufficiently detailed to allow review by another court.\n       (C) Expiration of preliminary injunctive relief.--\n     Preliminary injunctive relief shall automatically expire on \n     the date that is 90 days after the date on which such relief \n     is entered, unless the court--\n       (i) makes the findings required under subparagraph (A) for \n     the entry of permanent prospective relief; and\n       (ii) makes the order final before expiration of such 90-day \n     period.\n       (D) Requirements for order denying motion.--This paragraph \n     shall apply to any order denying the Government's motion to \n     vacate, modify, dissolve or otherwise terminate an order \n     granting prospective relief in any civil action pertaining to \n     the administration or enforcement of the immigration laws of \n     the United States.\n       (2) Procedure for motion affecting order granting \n     prospective relief against the government.--\n       (A) In general.--A court shall promptly rule on the \n     Government's motion to vacate, modify, dissolve or otherwise \n     terminate an order granting prospective relief in any civil \n     action pertaining to the administration or enforcement of the \n     immigration laws of the United States.\n       (B) Automatic stays.--\n       (i) In general.--The Government's motion to vacate, modify, \n     dissolve, or otherwise terminate an order granting \n     prospective relief made in any civil action pertaining to the \n     administration or enforcement of the immigration laws of the \n     United States shall automatically, and without further order \n     of the court, stay the order granting prospective relief on \n     the date that is 15 days after the date on which such motion \n     is filed unless the court previously has granted or denied \n     the Government's motion.\n       (ii) Duration of automatic stay.--An automatic stay under \n     clause (i) shall continue until the court enters an order \n     granting or denying the Government's motion.\n       (iii) Postponement.--The court, for good cause, may \n     postpone an automatic stay under clause (i) for not longer \n     than 15 days.\n       (iv) Orders blocking automatic stays.--Any order staying, \n     suspending, delaying, or otherwise barring the effective date \n     of the automatic stay described in clause (i), other than an \n     order to postpone the effective date of the automatic stay \n     for not longer than 15 days under clause (iii), shall be--\n\n       (I) treated as an order refusing to vacate, modify, \n     dissolve or otherwise terminate an injunction; and\n       (II) immediately appealable under section 1292(a)(1) of \n     title 28, United States Code.\n\n       (3) Settlements.--\n       (A) Consent decrees.--In any civil action pertaining to the \n     administration or enforcement of the immigration laws of the \n     United States, the court may not enter, approve, or\n\n[[Page S7327]]\n\n     continue a consent decree that does not comply with paragraph \n     (1).\n       (B) Private settlement agreements.--Nothing in this \n     subsection shall preclude parties from entering into a \n     private settlement agreement that does not comply with \n     paragraph (1) if the terms of that agreement are not subject \n     to court enforcement other than reinstatement of the civil \n     proceedings that the agreement settled.\n       (4) Expedited proceedings.--It shall be the duty of every \n     court to advance on the docket and to expedite the \n     disposition of any civil action or motion considered under \n     this subsection.\n       (5) Definitions.--In this subsection:\n       (A) Consent decree.--The term ``consent decree''--\n       (i) means any relief entered by the court that is based in \n     whole or in part on the consent or acquiescence of the \n     parties; and\n       (ii) does not include private settlements.\n       (B) Good cause.--The term ``good cause'' does not include \n     discovery or congestion of the court's calendar.\n       (C) Government.--The term ``Government'' means the United \n     States, any Federal department or agency, or any Federal \n     agent or official acting within the scope of official duties.\n       (D) Permanent relief.--The term ``permanent relief'' means \n     relief issued in connection with a final decision of a court.\n       (E) Private settlement agreement.--The term ``private \n     settlement agreement'' means an agreement entered into among \n     the parties that is not subject to judicial enforcement other \n     than the reinstatement of the civil action that the agreement \n     settled.\n       (F) Prospective relief.--The term ``prospective relief'' \n     means temporary, preliminary, or permanent relief other than \n     compensatory monetary damages.\n       (c) Effective Date.--\n       (1) In general.--This section shall apply with respect to \n     all orders granting prospective relief in any civil action \n     pertaining to the administration or enforcement of the \n     immigration laws of the United States, whether such relief \n     was ordered before, on, or after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act.\n       (2) Pending motions.--Every motion to vacate, modify, \n     dissolve or otherwise terminate an order granting prospective \n     relief in any such action, which motion is pending on the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, shall be treated as if it \n     had been filed on such date of enactment.\n       (3) Automatic stay for pending motions.--\n       (A) In general.--An automatic stay with respect to the \n     prospective relief that is the subject of a motion described \n     in paragraph (2) shall take effect without further order of \n     the court on the date which is 10 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act if the motion--\n       (i) was pending for 45 days as of the date of the enactment \n     of this Act; and\n       (ii) is still pending on the date which is 10 days after \n     such date of enactment.\n       (B) Duration of automatic stay.--An automatic stay that \n     takes effect under subparagraph (A) shall continue until the \n     court enters an order granting or denying the Government's \n     motion under subsection (b)(2). There shall be no further \n     postponement of the automatic stay with respect to any such \n     pending motion under subsection (b)(2)(B). Any order, \n     staying, suspending, delaying or otherwise barring the \n     effective date of this automatic stay with respect to pending \n     motions described in paragraph (2) shall be an order blocking \n     an automatic stay subject to immediate appeal under \n     subsection (b)(2)(B)(iv).\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this amendment is designed to end a \ndecades-old, obsolete Federal court injunction designed to impede the \nDepartment of Homeland Security's use of expedited removal and \nenforcement of our immigration laws.\n  In 1988, a Federal court in Los Angeles issued a permanent, \nnationwide injunction that requires immigration authorities to afford \ndetained Salvadorans a host of substantive and proposal rights--rights \nafforded to literally no other immigrant group.\n  Largely as a result of this 1988 Orantes injunction, Salvadorans have \nnow become the single largest component of what is known as OTMs or \n``other than Mexican'' immigrants.\n  Both the border tunnel amendment that Senator Feinstein has offered \nand my immigration injunction second-degree amendment deal with illegal \nimmigration and are designed to deal with criminal activity. They go \ntogether well because they both close border vulnerabilities that are \nbeing exploited by gangs and smugglers.\n  The injunction amendment passed as an amendment in committee, and \nthere has been little opposition. It is currently in the compromise \nbill endorsed by a majority of Senate Democrats.\n  The amendment requires courts to narrowly tailor injunctive relief \norders against the Government in immigration cases and to take into \naccount national security, border security, public safety, and \nimmigration enforcement concerns.\n  Decades-old, obsolete Federal court injunctions continue to impede \nthe Department of Homeland Security's efforts to enforce our \nimmigration laws.\n  For example, if you look at June of 2005 through February of 2006, \nyou can see why this specific injunction, which impedes the use of \nexpedited removal when it comes to immigrants from El Salvador, is such \na problem and why this amendment is necessary.\n  For example, in June of 2005 there were some 4,181 Brazilians subject \nto apprehension. At the same time, there were roughly the same number \nof El Salvadorans: 4,011. But because of the improvements in expedited \nremoval and immigration law enforcement inso far as it relates to \nBrazilians--not subject to the Orantes injunction that impedes the use \nof this important procedure--we saw the number of Brazilians drop from \n4,181 in June of 2005 to 72 in February of 2006.\n  During the same time period, because of the impediment created by the \nOrantes injunction, which prohibited the use of expedited removal when \nit came to Salvadorans who illegally immigrated into the United States, \nwe saw, in June of 2005, 4,011 Salvadorans; and in February of 2006, \nthat number has virtually not changed at all, to 3,906.\n  So, clearly, the impediment created by this Orantes injunction, that \nwould be overturned and remedied by this amendment, creates an \nimpediment for the Department of Homeland Security when it comes to \nenforcing our immigration laws.\n  This amendment, it is important to note, would not eliminate \ninjunctive relief but would require that any injunction granted be \nnarrowly tailored and to not unnecessarily impede on enforcement of our \nimmigration laws.\n  Specifically, it would provide that injunctions must be narrowly \ntailored to precisely address the actual harm identified. It would \nrequire that injunctions do not extend forever and must end on a date \ncertain. It provides that an injunction is suspended unless a court \nacts within 30 days of the date when the Government moves to vacate an \ninjunction. And for any injunction in which the Government has already \nfiled a motion to vacate--and which remains pending 10 days after \nenactment of this bill--that injunction is automatically stayed on that \n10th day.\n  Mr. President, I conclude by saying, in my conversations with the \nSecretary of the Department of Homeland Security, he regards this \namendment as important to providing the Department of Homeland Security \nthe tools it needs in order to enforce our immigration laws and to make \nsure the use of expedited removal, which is so important in terms of \nthe deterrence that it provides, be uniform across populations that \nwould be affected.\n  So, as he told me, if this amendment passes, he would be able to end \ncatch-and-release, which is a de facto policy of this Government, \nwithin a matter of months.\n  I would think this is an issue we can all support, and I ask my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4579\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask it \nbe reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside, and the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg], for himself and \n     Mr. Byrd, proposes an amendment numbered 4579.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the budget \nscorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office under \nsection 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional Budget \nAct of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for Senate \nscorekeeping of section 5 of S. Con. Res. 32, the first concurrent \nresolution on the budget for 1986.\n  This report shows the effects of congressional action on the 2006 \nbudget through June 30, 2006. The estimates of budget authority, \noutlays, and revenues are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the 2006 concurrent resolution on the budget, H. Con. \nRes. 95. Pursuant to section 402 of that resolution, provisions \ndesignated as emergency requirements are exempt from enforcement of the \nbudget resolution. As a result, the attached report excludes these \namounts.\n  The estimates show that current level spending is under the budget \nresolution by $11.873 billion in budget authority and by $4.060 billion \nin outlays in 2006. Current level for revenues is $6.589 billion above \nthe budget resolution in 2006.\n  Since my last report dated May 19, 2006, Congress has cleared and the \nPresident has signed the following acts which have changed budget \nauthority, outlays, or revenues: the Native American Technical \nCorrections Act of 2006, Public Law 109-221; the Heroes Earned \nRetirement Opportunities Act Public Law 109-227; the Emergency \nSupplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, \nand Hurricane Relief, 2006, Public Law 109-234; and the Mine \nImprovement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006 Public Law 109-236.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying letter and material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 10, 2006.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     Chairman Committee on the Budget,\n     U.S. Senate Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The enclosed tables show the effects of \n     Congressional action on the 2006 budget and are current \n     through June 30, 2006. This report is submitted under section \n     308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional Budget \n     Act, as amended.\n       The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues \n     are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions \n     for fiscal year 2006 that underlie H. Con.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \n125th anniversary of the founding of one of South Dakota's great \ncities, Mitchell. Located along I-90, Mitchell serves as the county \nseat of Davison County and is one of the State's most thriving \ncommunities. Mitchell is home to a strong economy, first-rate hospital, \na 4-year university and a technical institute, as well as numerous \ntourist destinations, art, culture, shopping, and outdoor recreation.\n  The site of Mitchell was originally platted in 1879 and then \nincorporated in 1881. Mitchell may be best known as the home of the \nCorn Palace. Build in 1897 to showcase South Dakota's healthy \nagriculture climate, the Corn Palace attracts over a half million \nvisitors annually. Each year a new theme and new murals are chosen and \nthe Corn Palace is redecorated with corn, other grains, and native \ngrasses. It is a great venue for displaying the variety of South Dakota \nagriculture. Additionally, the Corn Palace is more than a visitor's \nattraction; it serves as a host for state basketball tournaments, \ndances, meetings, banquets, and other civic events.\n  Also in Mitchell are historical and cultural attractions such as the \nPrehistoric Indian Village, Enchanted Doll Museum, and the Dakota \nDiscovery Museum. Mitchell's economy is also boosted by the hunting and \nfishing industries. The community is served by the Mitchell Republic \nnewspaper. Perhaps Mitchell's most famous resident is George McGovern, \nformer Representative and Senator of South Dakota and 1972 Democratic \nnominee for President.\n  Mitchell boasts one of South Dakota's oldest and finest educational \ninstitutions, Dakota Wesleyan University. DWU is a 4-year university \nwith 26 majors and 30 minors available. The latest addition to the \ncampus, the George and Eleanor McGovern Library and Center for \nLeadership and Public Service, is expected to be completed in August of \n2006. Mitchell is also home to Mitchell Technical Institute, a post-\nsecondary\n\n[[Page S7330]]\n\ntechnical school employing cutting edge technology in five occupational \nareas.\n  The Avera Queen of Peace Hospital, one of the most advanced medical \ncenters in the region, is also located in Mitchell. Especially \nnoteworthy is the recently finished Avera Queen of Peace Cancer Center. \nThe hospital employs over 700 people from the Mitchell area.\n  Even 125 years after its founding Mitchell remains a vital community \nand a great asset to South Dakota. I am pleased to honor this \nprogressive city and offer my congratulations to the residents of the \ncity on this historic milestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/11/senate-section/article/S7330-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7330]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PHOENIX SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to congratulate the \nPhoenix Symphony Orchestra, which will launch the celebration of its \ndiamond jubilee for the 2007/2008 season on December 30, 2006.\n  The Phoenix Symphony Orchestra is embarking on its 60th year of \nhaving a profound cultural and educational effect in the State of \nArizona. Founded in 1947, the Phoenix Symphony proudly serves Phoenix \nand the surrounding metropolitan area, the State of Arizona, and the \nsouthwestern United States. What began as an occasional group of \nmusicians performing a handful of concerts each year--in a city of \nfewer than 100,000 people--today serves more than 300,000 people \nannually, with 275 concerts and presentations throughout the greater \nPhoenix area and beyond.\n  Under the artistic leadership of Michael Christie as the Virginia G. \nPiper Music Director and administrative leadership of President \nMaryellen H. Gleason, the orchestra is overseen by the nonprofit \nPhoenix Symphony Association under Board Chairman Gerald W. Murphy.\n  The 76-member Phoenix Symphony presents an annual season from \nSeptember through the beginning of June, featuring full-length \nclassical and pops concerts at Symphony Hall in downtown Phoenix, in \nScottsdale, in Prescott, in several Native American communities and \nthroughout central Arizona. The symphony performs for more than 50,000 \nstudents and children, representing over 260 different schools, helping \nto introduce music to new generations through a variety of education \nand youth-engagement programs including programs at the Salt River Pima \nIndian Nation, Chicanos por la Causa, and Phoenix Elementary School \nDistrict No. 1.\n  Again, I congratulate the Phoenix Symphony Orchestra for its \nremarkable achievements and contributions to Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/11/senate-section/article/S7330-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7330]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIREMENT OF GEORGE GULSON\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \nachievements of Mr. George Gulson, who spent 43 years working in the \nBrandon Valley School System, including 13 years as superintendent. \nThroughout his career, Mr. Gulson has exhibited a true commitment to \nexcellence in education by creating positive learning environments for \nhis students.\n  Mr. Gulson started with Brandon Valley as the band director, a \nposition he held for 11 years. Though he has always loved music, Mr. \nGulson did not originally plan on being a teacher. Initially, he had \nplanned on going into pharmacy, but found that his lab classes at South \nDakota State University conflicted with the band schedule. Rather than \nstop playing in the band, he decided to go into education instead. He \nhad several options following his graduation, but after seeing the \nBrandon Valley band perform at a contest, he was so impressed that he \ncontacted the superintendent. He signed a teaching contract a few weeks \nlater.\n  In 1974, Mr. Gulson accepted a position as a junior high school \nprincipal in Brandon Valley. Though being an administrator was quite \ndifferent from teaching, it was a job he came to appreciate. He found \nthat he was able to influence youth at a time in their lives when they \nwere still learning who they are and how to interact with the world. In \naddition to helping students find themselves, the post also put Mr. \nGulson in a position to start thinking about ways to change the school. \nHe spent his last 3 years as principal readying the school to change \nfrom the junior high to the middle school philosophy.\n  Then in late 1993 came the call from the Brandon Valley School Board \nasking him to become superintendent. It was a job Mr. Gulson would \nexcel at for 13 years. Among the issues Mr. Gulson faced during his \ntenure were a growing student population, building projects, No Child \nLeft Behind provisions, curriculum, and funding. Brandon Valley's \nPerforming Arts Center was built on his watch, a particularly \nimpressive accomplishment.\n  George Gulson has shown unequivocal dedication to quality education \nthroughout his stellar career. As a teacher, principal, and \nsuperintendent Mr. Gulson has helped generations of students to become \nlifelong learners.

A bill to provide for the sale of approximately 25 acres of \npublic land to the Turn-About Ranch, Escalante, Utah, at fair market \nvalue; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that would \ncorrect a property trespass question involving a 25-acre parcel of \nBureau of Land Management, BLM, land in Garfield County, UT. The parcel \nis part of the Turn-About Ranch, which hosts a successful and popular \nprogram to rehabilitate troubled youth.\n  The trespass conflict is the result of an erroneous survey at the \ntime that Congress approved a major land exchange--Public Law 105-335--\nbetween the State of Utah and the BLM in January 1999. The legislation \nat hand would grant the owners of the ranch the opportunity to purchase \nthe erroneously surveyed land at fair market value so that this very \nimportant program for at-risk youth can continue unimpeded.\n  Since 1995, Turn-About Ranch has graduated some 500 troubled and at-\nrisk teenagers through an intense program of training and \nrehabilitation. The ranch employs some 35 Garfield County residents, \nand the Turn-About Ranch program has strong support from the local \ncommunity and the local civic leaders in the area.\n  Historically used for agriculture and grazing purposes, it was \npurchased by the Townsend Family and leased to Turn-About Ranch, Inc., \nfor the purpose of restoring dignity and self-esteem to wayward \nteenagers. Because Government-owned land administered by the BLM \nsurrounds the private land, the only way to resolve the trespass is to \nask for the blessing of Congress.\n  Mr. President, this legislation offers a simple and fair solution to \na fairly technical problem on our public lands. I hope Congress can use \nthis legislation to resolve this problem in the very near future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Ms. Snowe, \n        Mr. Warner, Mr. Graham, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Martinez, \n        Mr. Bunning, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Craig, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Ensign, Mr. \n        Coburn, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Thomas, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Chambliss, Mrs. \n        Hutchison, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Thune, \n        Mr. Bond, Mr. Smith, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Burns, Mr. \n        Talent, Mr. Burr, Mr. Allen, and Mrs. Dole):\n  S. 3633. A bill to require the withholding of United States \ncontributions to the United Nations until the President certifies that \nthe United Nations is not engaged in global taxation schemes; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I introduce to you a bill to prevent \nthe imposition of global taxes on the United States. The current \nefforts of the United Nations and other international organizations to \ndevelop, advocate, endorse, promote, and publicize proposals to raise \nrevenue by instituting international taxes are unacceptable.\n  The United Nations is not a sovereign nation and, therefore, does not \nhave the legal capacity to levy taxes. Furthermore, paying taxes to an \ninternational organization like the UN would impair global commerce, \nhinder the defense capabilities of the United States, and continue to \nline the pockets of an organization that has historically been replete \nwith mismanagement and corruption, especially in recent years. In order \nto avoid these consequences, the bill I bring before you will withhold \n20 percent of dues from the United Nations and other international \norganizations if they continue to promote global taxes. Its passage \nwill help preserve the sovereignty of our Nation and save American \ntaxpayers from potentially paying billions of dollars every year to \ninternational organizations.\n  The United Nations' record of developing and advocating global \ntaxation goes back for more than a decade. Usually the organization's \nefforts have been done quietly so as not to elicit the ire of the \nUnited States. However, in 1996 Secretary General Boutros-Boutros Ghali \ndelivered a speech at Oxford University in which he openly embraced the \nconcept of global taxes and authoritarian world government. \nSpecifically, the Secretary General expressed a desire for the United \nNations to ``not be under the daily financial will of the member \nstates.'' Though the U.N. had tried to circumvent the Security Council \nand avoid member state scrutiny for many years by borrowing from \ninternational financial institutions, assuming control of bonds issued \nby Member States, and imposing fees on an extensive range of \ntransactions, goods and services, this was the first time the concept \nof global taxation was so explicitly advocated.\n  In response to the United Nations' actions, Senator Bob Dole and \nRepresentative Gerald Solomon introduced bills in both Houses of \nCongress in January of 1996 to put a stop to the United Nations' \nantics. These bills prohibited any voluntary or assessed contributions \nfrom the United States to the United Nations if the United Nations \ncontinued to develop and promote proposals for international taxes and \nfees. That legislation passed through the 104th and the 105th \nCongresses to become public law.\n  Still, the United Nations continued to pursue global taxation. Later \nin 1996, the United Nations Economic and Social Council fully debated \ninternational taxation. After that, a United Nations Development \nProgramme research project resulted in the publishing of a text \nentitled ``The Tobin Tax,'' which proposed a currency transaction tax. \nGlobal taxation was discussed in ``The Human Development Report'' in \n1999 as well as at the United Nations Preparatory Committee for the \nInternational Conference on Financing for Development in 2001. Also in \n2001, Ernesto Zedillo published a report which concluded ``there is a \ngenuine need to establish, by international consensus, stable and \ncontractual new sources of multilateral finance.'' Dialog arose at the \nConference on Sharing Global Prosperity in Helsinki in 2003. In 2004, \nthe United Nations University-World Institute for Development Economics \nResearch issued a study on global taxation.\n  Recently, the 2005 ``Human Development Report'' discussed proposals \nto levy international taxes in order to fund the U.N.'s Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. Some of the taxes the United Nations proposed in \nthis report were taxes on aviation fuel, an airline passenger tax, and \na currency transaction tax like the Tobin tax. At other points in time \nthe U.N. has considered a global environmental levy, an ocean freight \ntax on international trade, and a military expenditures and arms tax.\n  Innovative development financing mechanisms were the primary topics \nof discussion at a conference held in Paris on February 28 and March 1 \nof 2006. As a result of this conference and other discussions, various \nnations, most notably France, are already implementing an international \ntax on airline travel, with the approval of Kofi Annan. Plans for \nglobal taxes on currency transactions, energy use, and United States \ncompanies are also being considered. An official U.N.-sponsored book, \n``New Sources of Development Finance,'' says that a proposed tax on \noil, gas, coal and other carbon-based fuels could produce $750 billion \na year in revenue for the U.N. and other global purposes.\n\n[[Page S7334]]\n\n  We have frequently reminded the United Nations of our sentiments \nregarding global taxation after legislation formally passed through \nCongress in 1996 and 1998. Recently, on August 30, 2005, the U.S. \nrepresentative to the United Nations, John R. Bolton, clearly stated \n``the United States does not accept global aid targets or global \ntaxes.'' Shortly after, on September 13, 2005, 16 Senators joined with \nme in sending a letter to Kofi Annan which reiterated Mr. Bolton's \nmessage. Still, the United Nations has continued to research and \npromote different forms of international taxation.\n  Since the United Nations is not listening to the United States, now \nit is time for Congress to back up our words. The bill I am introducing \nalong with 31 colleagues states that if the United Nations or other \ninternational organizations continue to pursue global taxation, the \nUnited States will withhold 20 percent of assessed contributions to the \nregular budget of these organizations. This measure would last until \ncertification is given by the President to Congress that neither the \nUnited Nations nor any other international organization has legal \ntaxation authority in the United States, that no taxes or fees have \nbeen imposed on the United States, and that no taxes have been proposed \nby any of these organizations.\n  The fascination of the United Nations and other international \norganizations with international taxation has gone on too long. Please \njoin me in taking a stand for the sovereignty of our Nation by \nsupporting this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 3634. A bill to amend the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to \nimprove the material control and accounting and data management systems \nused by civilian nuclear power reactors to better account for spent \nnuclear fuel and reduce the risks associated with the handling of those \nmaterials; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Spent Nuclear \nFuel Control and Accounting Act of 2006. I am pleased to be joined by \nthe Senior Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, in introducing this \nlegislation. In the other body, our colleague from Vermont, Congressman \nSanders, is introducing a companion measure. This legislation is \ndesigned to improve the safety and security of spent nuclear fuel \ngenerated by our Nation's nuclear powerplants.\n  Approximately 2,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel are generated \nby the Nation's 103 nuclear powerplants each year. Spent nuclear fuel \nis no longer able to generate power but is still intensely radioactive \nand continues to generate heat for tens of thousands of years. \nRadiation produced by the fuel can kill a person within minutes if they \nare directly exposed.\n  Terrorist attacks in the U.S. have heightened public concern \ngenerally about whether this highly radioactive material could be \nstolen and used maliciously. Although the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission, NRC, argues that spent nuclear fuel is ``self-protecting'' \nbecause of its high radioactivity, the potential for harm to human \nhealth and the environment warrants close attention to the control and \naccounting of this material.\n  I am introducing this legislation because there have been several \ninstances of lost spent nuclear fuel at operating plants in the past \nfew years, including in my own home State. Such losses have eroded \npublic confidence in the job the NRC is doing. Following the loss of \nspent fuel rod fragments at Vermont Yankee in 2004, I requested that \nGAO study the issue of how the NRC controls such material. In its April \n2005 report, the GAO recommended that the NRC establish requirements \nfor the control of individual fuel rods and fragments and develop \ninspection procedures to verify plants' compliance.\n  NRC currently has no regulations that specifically deal with the \ntracking and recordkeeping of spent nuclear fuel of this type. While \nthe NRC generally has regulations requiring plant operators to maintain \nrecords of their spent nuclear fuel they do not specify how individual \nfuel rods and fragments should be tracked. Additionally, the NRC \nrequires plant operators to inventory spent fuel at least once a year, \nbut does not specify how that inventory should be conducted. Because of \nthis lack of specificity in its regulations, there is considerable \nvariation among nuclear powerplants in how regulations are implemented. \nPlus, the NRC no longer monitors plants' compliance with its tracking \nand accounting regulations.\n  While the NRC has been working administratively to address the issues \nidentified in the GAO report, the proposed legislation would require \nthe NRC to more effectively control and account for spent nuclear fuel. \nThe NRC needs to redouble its efforts to shore up public confidence in \nits regulatory efforts. This is a difficult task, but one that is \ncritically important.\n  This bill will focus on the safe operation and management of existing \nnuclear powerplants. The NRC and the nuclear industry are planning for \na ``nuclear renaissance'' with the construction of new nuclear plants. \nThe NRC estimates that it will receive 18 new license requests between \nnow and the year 2012. But, we must maintain continued oversight over \nexisting plants and pay particular attention to the safe management of \nspent nuclear fuel. The public needs to be confident that the current \nsystem operates well, or they will likely not accept a new generation \nof plants.\n  The Spent Nuclear Fuel Control and Accounting Act of 2006 directs NRC \nto develop regulations which would improve the current system of \ncontrol and accounting for spent nuclear fuel and would help prevent \nincidents like the one which occurred at Vermont Yankee.\n  In the case of Vermont Yankee, operated by Entergy, the plant's \noperators discovered that two pieces of a radioactive fuel rod were \nmissing from the plant's storage facilities on April 21, 2004. During a \nscheduled fuel outage, the plant conducted a special inspection \nrequested by the NRC to document the location of its fuel rods, both \nspent and unspent.\n  The documentation of the pieces' location was requested by the NRC as \npart of a follow up to the loss of two complete spent fuel rods at the \nMillstone plant in Connecticut in 2000. At Vermont Yankee, the missing \npieces were 7 and 17 inches long, and came from a fuel rod sent to the \nVermont Yankee plant by General Electric in 1979 that arrived broken. \nWhen the rod broke, the pieces were placed in a lead bucket at the \nbottom of the spent fuel pool, in which low-level waste was \nperiodically also stored. Later it was learned that a special storage \ncontainer was ordered from General Electric to house these pieces, and \nthat they were stored in a different part of the fuel pool.\n  The NRC was involved in Entergy's efforts to use a remote-control \ncamera to see if the misplaced rod pieces were among the spent fuel \nrods in the plant's spent fuel pool. Entergy also reviewed paper \nrecords to see if two missing fuel rods from the plant were shipped to \nwaste storage facilities in South Carolina or the State of Washington. \nThe spent fuel rods were eventually located on July 15, 2004, after a \nsearch in which Entergy estimates company employees and outside \ncontractors had spent between 9,000 and 10,000 hours involved in the \nsearch.\n  A similar event occurred at the Millstone nuclear powerplant in \nConnecticut in 2000 and at the Humboldt Bay plant in California in July \n2004. Pacific Gas and Electric officials searched for three missing \nuranium components of a used nuclear fuel rod in the reactor pool at \nthe decommissioned Humboldt Bay nuclear powerplant near Eureka, CA. \nEach of the pieces of the missing Humboldt Bay fuel rod is 18 inches \nlong, has the width of a pencil and contains uranium fuel encased in \nsteel. The rods from the Humboldt Bay and Millstone plants are still \nmissing. The Millstone plant paid a $288,000 fine for the loss of its \nfuel.\n  When the Millstone incident occurred, the NRC said that fuel rods had \nnever before gone missing in the history of commercial nuclear power in \nthe United States. While I know that the materials at Vermont Yankee \nwere found to be missing due in part to a special inspection the NRC \ninstituted after Millstone, the sad fact is that fuel again went \nmissing. I do not want missing fuel to become the norm. It is not \nenough to tell the public that we ``think'' it is likely that highly \nradioactive material went to storage. Certainly it is poor government \nmanagement not to look carefully at how the\n\n[[Page S7335]]\n\nutilities conducted these searches for missing fuel rods, draw out \nlessons, develop best management practices, and safeguard and protect \nthe existing paper trail we have for the waste stored at our Nation's \nnuclear power plants. We must improve our nuclear materials accounting \nsystem, and my legislation is the first step in doing so.\n  This legislation calls for NRC to pay special attention to loose \nindividual spent fuel rods and rod fragments like those lost at the \nVermont Yankee plant. It requires NRC to report when loose fuel rods \nand fragments result and requires NRC to conduct an annual inspection \nto make sure that plants are complying with waste tracking \nrequirements. Additionally, the bill instructs NRC to develop best \nmanagement practices for the safe storage of individual rods and \nfragments and for the inventory of spent nuclear fuel. The legislation \nwill require NRC to modernize its data management systems by developing \nan updated electronic system for storing data and for tracking the \nlocation of spent nuclear fuel. The creation of an electronic database \nof spent fuel storage records would help secure this important \ninformation from aging plants that are being uprated and relicensed and \nalso require the new fleet of plants to use a uniform electronic \nsystem. Finally, this bill would track the movement of spent nuclear \nfuel onsite at nuclear powerplants and offsite to other facilities by \nrequiring that manifests indicate whether shipments contain fuel rods \nor fragments.\n  I believe that this bill will be an important step towards improving \nsecurity related to one of the most hazardous materials made by \nhumans--spent nuclear fuel. This bill would increase the scrutiny on \nthe tracking of this material and ensure that spent nuclear fuel \nremains safely stored in appropriate facilities and does not end up in \nthe wrong hands.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3634\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Spent Nuclear Fuel Control \n     and Accounting Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) several incidents involving missing or unaccounted-for \n     spent nuclear fuel have occurred at civilian nuclear power \n     reactors, including--\n       (A) the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant;\n       (B) the Humboldt Bay Nuclear Power Plant (California); and\n       (C) the Millstone Nuclear Power Station (Connecticut);\n       (2) weaknesses in the accounting and control of spent \n     nuclear fuel have been identified at several other civilian \n     nuclear power reactors;\n       (3) data provided by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \n     indicate that--\n       (A) operators of most civilian nuclear power reactors have \n     removed spent fuel rods from their fuel assemblies; and\n       (B) those rods are stored onsite in spent fuel pools or dry \n     casks or have been shipped offsite to a storage facility;\n       (4) individual spent fuel rods and fragments may also \n     result from the loading of a new assembly and therefore may \n     be new fuel;\n       (5) individual spent fuel rods, and especially fragments of \n     spent fuel rods, are--\n       (A) highly radioactive; and\n       (B) much smaller and lighter than fuel assemblies;\n       (6) while regulations promulgated by the Nuclear Regulatory \n     Commission require civilian nuclear power reactors to control \n     and account for spent nuclear fuel, they do not cover--\n       (A) individual spent fuel rods that have been removed from \n     an assembly; and\n       (B) fragments of spent fuel rods;\n       (7) the storage and oversight of individual spent fuel rods \n     at civilian nuclear power reactors have not been managed in a \n     consistent manner;\n       (8) the lack of specific guidance in the regulations \n     promulgated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission relating to \n     how civilian nuclear power reactors should conduct physical \n     inventories has resulted in inconsistent compliance with \n     those regulations;\n       (9) the Nuclear Regulatory Commission does not evaluate the \n     compliance of civilian nuclear power reactors with the \n     material control and accounting regulations promulgated by \n     the Commission;\n       (10) the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has much to do to \n     implement the recommendations listed in the report published \n     by the Government Accountability Office titled ``NRC Needs to \n     Do More to Ensure that Power Plants Are Effectively \n     Controlling Spent Nuclear Fuel''; and\n       (11) the effective implementation of material control and \n     accounting regulations by civilian nuclear power reactors is \n     of great importance to the United States because of the \n     potential safety and security consequences for failing to \n     manage spent nuclear fuel, especially in the aftermath of \n     terrorist attacks in the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3. MATERIAL CONTROL AND ACCOUNTING OF DISMANTLED FUEL \n                   ASSEMBLY.\n\n       The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (42 U.S.C. 10101 et \n     seq.) is amended by adding after section 137 the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 138.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nAlbuquerque Indian Schools Act of 2006. I want to thank Senator \nBingaman for joining me as a cosponsor of the bill.\n  The Albuquerque Indian Schools--AIS--Act of 2006 seeks to consolidate \ntwo parcels of federal land and take this land into trust for the 19 \npueblos--Acoma, Cochiti, Isleta, Jemez, Laguna, Nambe, Ohkay Owingeh, \nPicuris, Pojoaque, San Felipe, San Ildefonso, Sandia, Santa Ana, Santa \nClara, Santo Domingo, Taos, Tesuque, Zia and Zuni. I believe this \nproperty, if transferred, would receive greater utilization and benefit \nthe economic development of the 19 pueblos.\n  In 1981, the 19 New Mexico pueblos petitioned the United States for \nthe transfer of 44 acres from the Albuquerque Indian School site for \nthe purpose of economic development and in 1984 the Assistant Secretary \nof the Interior conveyed the 44 acres to the pueblos. This land is \ncurrently under development by the 19 New Mexico pueblos. They have \nconstructed a 150,000 square foot Department of the Interior building \nwhich houses the southern regional office of the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs, BIA, and a 150,000 square foot Department of the Interior \noffice building that houses the National BIA Training Center and the \nBIA Data Center. In addition, the pueblos are starting construction on \na hotel and are preparing to begin several retail projects.\n  In 2003, the 19 pueblos requested conveyance of the two remaining \ntracts of land that are located south of Interstate 40. This land \ncontains various metal buildings, which have deteriorated to the point \nthat they have no value at this time.\n  The return of these two properties to the 19 pueblos is supported by \nthe southwestern regional office of the BIA. With the addition of these \ntwo tracts, the 19 pueblos will be able to continue their successful \neconomic development of the Albuquerque Indian School property, which \nwill benefit not only the 19 New Mexico pueblos, but each individual \ntribal member.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3635\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Albuquerque Indian School \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

LAND TAKEN INTO TRUST FOR BENEFIT OF 19 PUEBLOS.\n\n       (a) Action by Secretary.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary shall take into trust all \n     right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the \n     land described in subsection (b) (including any improvements \n     and appurtenances to the land) for the benefit of the 19 \n     Pueblos.\n       (2) Administration.--The Secretary shall--\n       (A) take such action as the Secretary determines to be \n     necessary to document the transfer under paragraph (1); and\n       (B) appropriately assign each applicable private and \n     municipal utility and service right or agreement.\n       (b) Description of Land.--The land referred to in \n     subsection (a)(1) is the 2 tracts of Federal land, the \n     combined acreage of which is approximately 18.3046 acres, \n     that were historically part of the Albuquerque Indian School, \n     more particularly described as follows:\n       (1) Tract b.--The approximately 5.9211 acres located in \n     sec. 7 and sec. 8 of T. 10 N., R. 3 E., of the New Mexico \n     Principal Meridian in the city of Albuquerque, New Mexico, as \n     identified on the map entitled ``Site Map of the Albuquerque \n     Indian School Property'' (including attachments).\n       (2) Tract d.--The approximately 12.3835 acres located in \n     sec. 7 and sec. 8 of T. 10 N., R. 3 E., of the New Mexico \n     Principal Meridian in the city of Albuquerque, New Mexico, as \n     identified on the map entitled ``Site Map of the Albuquerque \n     Indian School Property'' (including attachments).\n       (c) Use of Land.--The land taken into trust under \n     subsection (a) shall be used for the educational, health, \n     cultural, business, and economic development of the 19 \n     Pueblos.\n       (d) Limitations and Conditions.--The land taken into trust \n     under subsection (a) shall remain subject to any private or \n     municipal encumbrance, right-of-way, restriction, easement of \n     record, or utility service agreement in effect on the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 4. EFFECT OF OTHER LAWS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as otherwise provided in this \n     section, land taken into trust under section 3(a) shall be \n     subject to Federal laws relating to Indian land.\n       (b) Gaming.--No gaming activity (within the meaning of the \n     Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.)) shall \n     be carried out on land taken into trust under section 3(a).\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I'm pleased today to join my colleague \nSenator Domenici in sponsoring the Albuquerque Indian School Act. This \nbill would direct the Secretary of Interior to take lands no longer \nbeing used by the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Albuquerque and hold them \nin trust for the benefit of the 19 pueblos. The bill disallows gaming \non the property.\n  In addition to being a good thing for the pueblos, this transfer \npromises to be beneficial to the surrounding community, as several \ndeteriorating structures will be renewed and new jobs brought in. Since \nthe bill would not alter the standard public process for taking the \nlands into trust, I hope this will result in a consensus among all \nconcerned on the best uses of the property.\n  I am pleased we are taking the first step today on a process that \nshould be beneficial to the pueblos, the Federal Government, and local \nresidents.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY:\n  S. 3637. A bill to require the submittal to Congress of any \nPresidential Daily Briefing relating to Iraq during the period \nbeginning on January 20, 1997, and ending on March 19, 2003; read the \nfirst time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation on an \nintelligence issue, p. 3637.\n  The legislation requires the administration to provide the prewar \nPresidential daily briefs on Iraq to the Senate Intelligence Committee \nfor its investigation on the way the administration's policymakers used \nthis intelligence in its decision to go to war.\n  I introduced an identical bill, S. 2175, on December 22 last year, \nbut it has not yet been reported out of the Intelligence Committee.\n  It is essential that the Intelligence Committee have access to all \nthe information about prewar intelligence in Iraq for its \ninvestigation. With threats looming in North Korea and Iran, we need to \nlearn from the mistakes of the past to ensure that we do not repeat \nthem. The PDBs are extremely relevant to this issue, and Congress \nshould have access to them.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 3638. A bill to encourage the Secretary of the Interior to \nparticipate in projects to plan, design, and construct water supply \nprojects and to amend the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater Study \nand Facilities Act to encourage the design, planning, and construction \nof projects to treat impaired surface water, reclaim and reuse impaired \ngroundwater, and provide brine\n\n[[Page S7337]]\n\ndisposal in the State of California; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto authorize water recycling and other water supply projects by the \nInland Empire Utilities Agency, the Cucamonga Valley Water District, \nthe Western Municipal Water District, the Yucaipa Valley Water \nDistrict, and the City of Corona Water Utility. These projects will \nproduce approximately 161,000 acre-feet of new water annually in one of \nthe most rapidly growing regions in the United States, reducing the \nneed for imported water from the Colorado River and northern California \nthrough the California Water Project.\n  This legislation is intended to be the companion to two House of \nRepresentatives bills: H.R. 802, sponsored by David Dreier, Grace \nNapolitano, Ken Calvert, Joe Baca, and Gary Miller; and H.R. 1008, \nsponsored by Ken Calvert, Jerry Lewis, Joe Baca and Darrell Issa. H.R. \n802 and H.R. 1008 have each passed the House of Representatives twice, \nin both this Congress and the previous Congress.\n  Environmental groups such as the Mono Lake Committee, Environmental \nDefense, Clean Water and Natural Resources Defense Council strongly \nsupport the water recycling and groundwater remediation projects in \nthis bill. Business leaders such as Southern Cal Edison and Building \nIndustry Association also support these projects.\n  I would like to describe the projects in this bill:\n  The Inland Empire Regional Water Recycling Initiative would authorize \ntwo project components. The first will be constructed by the Inland \nEmpire Utilities Agency--IEUA--and will produce approximately 90,000 \nacre feet of new water annually. The second of these projects, to be \nconstructed by the Cucamonga Valley Water District--CVWD--will produce \nan additional 5,000 acre feet of new water annually.\n  The Inland Empire Regional Water Recycling Initiative has the support \nof all member agencies of IEUA, as well as the water agencies \ndownstream in Orange County. IEUA encompasses approximately 242 square \nmiles and serves the cities of Chino, Chino Hills, Fontana--through the \nFontana Water Company--Ontario, Upland, Montclair, Rancho Cucamonga--\nthrough the Cucamonga Valley Water District--and the Monte Vista Water \nDistrict.\n  The next project is Western Municipal Water District's Riverside-\nCorona Feeder. Western provides supplemental water to a 510 square mile \narea of growing western Riverside County and serves a population of \nmore than one-half million people. As a member of the Metropolitan \nWater District of Southern California--MWD--Western provides \nsupplemental water to the cities of Corona, Norco, and Riverside and \nthe water agencies of Elsinore Valley and Rancho California. Western \nalso serves customers in the unincorporated areas of El Sobrante, Eagle \nValley, Temescal Creek, Woodcrest, Lake Mathews, and March Air Reserve \nBase.\n  The purpose of the Riverside--Corona Feeder water supply project is \nto capture and store new water in wet years in order to increase firm \nwater supplies, reduce water costs, and improve water quality. The \nproject will include about 20 wells and 28 miles of pipeline. Studies \nhave shown the safe annual yield of the aquifer is about 40,000 acre-\nfeet.\n  The project would allow locally stored water to replace imported \nwater from Colorado River and the State project sources in times of \ndrought or other shortages. The project proposes to manage the ground \nwater levels by the construction of ground water wells and pumping \ncapacity to deliver the pumped ground water supply to water users. A \nnew water conveyance pipeline is also proposed that will serve western \nRiverside County.\n  There are also very important environmental remediation aspects of \nthe project. Up to half of the wells could be placed within plumes of \nVOCs and perchlorate. These wells would remediate about 20,000 acre-\nfeet of currently contaminated water per year.\n  Next, the city of Corona Water Recycling and Reuse Project will \nconsist of three reservoirs and two pump stations along with \nretrofitted user irrigation systems.\n  Additionally, 27 miles of pipelines will separate recycled water from \ndrinking water. The reclamation system will enable the city of Corona \nto provide recycled water to parks, landscape maintenance districts, \nschools, landscaped freeway frontages and any other project that does \nnot require potable water. It will also reduce the need for increased \nwater imports and construction of additional drinking water \ninfrastructure.\n  Finally, the Yucaipa Valley Water Supply Renewal Project will \nmaximize the various water resources in the Yucaipa Valley. Federal \nfunds would be used to provide federal assistance for planning, \ndesigning, and constructing the new Yucaipa Valley Regional Water \nFiltration Facility that is part of the renewal project. The new \nfacility will contain a reverse osmosis system and a brine pipeline to \nremove salinity, contaminants, and organic compounds from the water \nsupply in the Yucaipa Valley. The brine pipeline will extend nearly 20 \nmiles to the existing Santa Ana Regional Interceptor brine pipeline.\n  This project will minimize the amount of water imported from northern \nCalifornia, maximize the use of higher quality water, reduce \nwithdrawals from ground water supplies, and provide a long-term, \ndrought-proof water supply. The full project is expected to reduce \ndemands on the California State Water Project by over 4 billion gallons \nper year, which is a sufficient quantity of water for 27,000 families.\n  I want to say a few words about the importance of water recycling \nprojects.\n  The development of recycled water can bring significant amounts of \nwater ``on line'' in a relatively short period of time. Recycled water \nprovides our State and region with the ability to ``stretch'' existing \nwater supplies significantly and in so doing, minimize conflict and \naddress the many needs that exist. According to the State of \nCalifornia's Recycled Water Task Force, water recycling is a critical \npart of California's water future with an estimated 1.5 million acre-\nfeet of new supplies being developed over the next 25 years.\n  Water recycling is also a bipartisan initiative in California, as \nwitnessed by the many Republican and Democratic House cosponsors of the \nHouse versions of the bill I introduce today.\n  It also has a long history. In 1991, the Secretary of the Interior in \nPresident George H.W. Bush's administration, Manual Lujan, recognized \nthat California would need an alternative water supply source because \nit was receiving more water from the Colorado River than its \nallocation.\n  In a bold and farsighted maneuver, in August 1991, Secretary Lujan \nlaunched the Southern California Water Initiative, a program to \nevaluate and study the feasibility of water reclamation projects. Mr. \nLujan's vision was to build replacement water capacity to offset the \nanticipated Colorado River water supply reductions.\n  Congress, in 1992, was completing work on major water legislation saw \nthe wisdom of the Lujan initiative too. Lujan's proposal, a year after \nit was first announced, became title XVI, the Bureau of Reclamation \nwater recycling program that today serves the entire West, not just \nCalifornia. Today, water recycling is the essential water supply \nelement in Albuquerque, Phoenix, Denver, Salt Lake City, Tucson, El \nPaso, San Antonio, Portland, and other western metropolitan areas.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill to help meet the West's \nwater supply needs and to reduce our dependence on the Colorado River. \nI ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3638\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Senator Thune should be commended for his perseverance. \nHe often rushes to the floor to preside for only 10 minutes as we close \nour business for the day, making 100 hours seem almost unattainable. \nCongratulations to our Presiding Officer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/11/senate-section/article/S7360-5", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7360]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, JULY 12, 2006\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
